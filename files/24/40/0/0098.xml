Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information, CSW/007.15WEEKLY   REPORT   OIT   SWEDENVII.(Jan. 31st, 1018)One of the subjects which has for some time greatly interested the Swedish Government has been the ultimate possession or neutralisation of the &amp;aland Islands which have for over a century belonged to Russia.     Quite recently information has been received from a reliable source that the Swedish Government are expecting, and will probably accept, an invitation from the Central Bowers to send a delegate to Brest Litovsk to discuss the Aaland Island question with the other delegates there assembled.     Their object in doing so is to obtain a formal declaration on the part of the Russians on the one side and the Central Powers on the other, as signatories of the Treaty of Paris, in favour of neutralisation.     This would of course have to be ratified by all. the signatories of the Treaty of Psria when ultimately fteneral peace negotiations take place.It is the belief of the Swedish Government that, if the Russian Government came to terms with the Central Powers, they-themselv-es may not be represented at the General peace negotiations and that the Aaland question, if then settled, woufid not receive their sanction.It has been pointed out to the Swedish Government that if they accepted an invitation to send ?; delegate to Brest such action would unfavourably impress the Governments of the Allied Powers and might, at the ultimate Peace Conference, prejudice a settlement of the Aaland Island question against Swedish interests.

Quite recently information has heen received from a reliable, source that the Swedish Government are expecting, and will probably accept, an invitation from the Central Powers to send a delegate to Brest Litovsk to discuss the Aaland Island question with the other delegates there assembled.     Their object in doing so is to obtain a formal declaration on the part of the Russians on the one side and the Central Powers on the other, as signatories of the Treaty of Paris, in favour of neutralisation.     This would of course have to be ratified by all. the signatories of the Treaty of Paris when ultimately general peace negotiations take place.It is the belief of the Swedish Government that, if the Russian Government came to terms with the Central Powers, they^ themseJv-es may not be represented at the General neace negotiations and that the Aaland question, if then settled, wouffid not receive their sanction.It has been pointed out to the Swedish Government that if they accepted an invitation to 3end ?; delegate to Brest such action would unfavourably impress the Governments of the Allied Powers and might, at the ultimate Peace Conference, prejudice a settlement of the Aaland Island question against Swedish interests.     It was suggested to the Swedish Hinister for Foreign Affairs that it was an extraordinary proceeding to send a delegate to participate in negotiations re-gcirding an International Treaty with some only of the parties to
that Treaty.     It would be a more proper course for the Swedish Government to refuse the invitation of the Central Powers and then address an identic Hote to all the signatories of the Treaty of Paris putting forward their point of view *nd expressing the hope that the matter might be dealt with at  %$t* General Peace Conference.   Another difficulty would obviously be the fact that the Swedish Government had not, as yet, recognised the Bolshevik Government and in those circumstances could hardly send a delegate to negotiate with them at Brest Litovsk while declining to deal with them at petrograd.The view of the Swedish Government is that Swedish public opinion is agitated at the fortifications constructed by the Russians before the Revolution but since the outbreak of the war, and that there is a general demand in the country for action to be taken before the conclusion of the war , to remove what is looked upon as a menace. It was suggested to Mr. Hellner (Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs) that these fortifications were manned by only two thousand Russian v troops and having regard to the chaotic state of Russia-could hardly be considered *-s offering the slightest menace to Sweden.     Further, the destruction of these fortificr-tions was a matter whioh from the moment the Russian Government had recognised the independence of Fin-land seemed to concern chiefly Finland herself.     The most practical course vould be for the Finns to negotiate with the Bolshevik Govern-ment for the withdrawal of the Aaland garrison and subsequently to arrange with the Finnish Authorities for the razing of the fortifice-tions.     The only jnenace to Sweden would be if the Germans were to seize the Islands; and i;. was suggested to Mr. Hellner that it would be politic to ask the German Government for a guarantee against such an eventuality.     It would appear that it is only Swedish public opinion which is bringing pressure on Mr. Hellner, but more probably also King Gustaf. whose pro-German proclivities are well-known.
Meanwhile-civil war is raging^in- Finland^^ixyh^ak^--a^etiaement of the thorny Aaland question more difficult and further off than ever.At the time of Mr. $ranting!s resignation there were a certain number of people in Sweden v/ho imagined that he was not really leaving the Cabinet on account of ill-health, but in order more effectually to join in the peace ccumpaign;     There seems no reason to doubt that his plea of ill health was quite genuine.     He took up the position of Minister of Finance with reluotenoe and found the work of too exacting a nature. -/During his not very lengthy tenure of office several situations have arisen whioh makes it a matter of congratulation for the Entente that a Liberal-Socialist, and not a Conservative Cabinet was in power.   In a recont interview published by the &quot;Social Demokrat&quot; Mr. Branting ex-pressed the hope that the Swedish Government had already prepared the ground for a better understanding with the Entente Powers.    As Mr. Branting&apos;s relations with the present Prime Minister (Professor Eden) and his other late colleagues continue to be so cordial it is probable that his great influence will be exercised in favour of the existing Government.     The activist Press are of course glad at his departure and hope that it will weaken the Cabinet.     They express doubts as to his successor, Mr. Thorsen, being capable of efficiently carrying out the difficult duties of Minister of Finance;   but less biased opinion speaks favourably of the new Minister&apos;s energy and aapacity.A good deal of alarm has been shown in the Conservative and Liberal Press at the proposal of the Bolsheviks to advance very large sums to support the extreme Socialist Parties in foreign oountries.     The more respectable Swedish Socialists condemn this action which finds adherents in what is known as the Young Socialist Party, the members of which no doubt hope to participate in the ptnnder.   It would be interesting to know what the Young Socialists would say if a foreign Government voted money for anti-Socialist propaganda in Sweden.
