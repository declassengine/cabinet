(This Document is the Property/of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)MINISTRY   OP   SHIPPING.7OATS RATION AND HORSES FOR THE BRITISH ARM.It is understood .(War Cabinet 329, Minute 6) that instructions have been given for the oat ration fgr horses of tho British foroeo to be reduced to 10 lbs.    This is all to tho good so far as it goes, but believing that further roduction is possible, I would urge in view of the great pressure on tonnage that the figure be fixod for tho present at 9 and not 10 lbs.There is also the question whether, in present oircumstances, it would not bo possible to reduce the number of horses hitherto regarded as necessary.     I have again and again pointed out to the Y/ar Cabinot tho extraordinary amount of tonnage taken up in conveying and supplying horses.The tonnage situation is so serious that every possible method of saving tonnage must be fully explored.     I, therefore, request that the War Cabinet will give instructions for these two points to be enquired into fully without delay.January 191ft.(Sgd.) J. p. Maclay.
