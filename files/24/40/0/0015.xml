Odoael Jones(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majssty&apos;s Government.)9-oalgor&amp;duffs.-33 SITUATION&apos;AND POOD SUPPLY.Memorandum by tho Pood Controller.I regret that it is again necessary to direct the attention of the Cabinet to the serious situation of food imports.     There ie a heavy prospective deficiency in arrivals as compared with indent requirements, both in this month and in the next.    The position is briefly illustrated by the following notes on three of the principal items of food.The estimated deficits of arrival in January and February as compared with the average monthly tonnage indent required to give 13 weeks * supply at the end of the cereal year are:-Tons. Per cent.January 193,500 February 282,600.51 46These deficits following similar deficiencies in September to Dee ember will make a total deficit by the end&apos;-pf February amounting  6 nearly 1,200,000 tons.On the estimated arrivals the stock of breadstuffs, apart3/from farm stocks, is estimated to be no more than 7. /7 weeks&apos; supply on March 1st.     This is precisely the same stock as was held on the same date in 1317 when the position gave rise to such aoute anxiety.     In the present year the danger will be far more serious owing to the shortage of other foods and to the fac that we have already to a large extent exhausted measures of economy - such as the increased extraction of flour - to which recourse was had last year.The. estimated deficiencies in arrivals are:-Tons per cent.January 28,000 February   14,40025 13
IThe stocks of raw sugar run out in February and there will be a dislocation of distribution which might have a serious effect on the arrangements for rationing.   Failure to lift the Cuban sugar now will probably result in its being absorbed by America and in our having to go to Java lateri    The Sugar Commission ask for the allocation of twelve vessels to load Cuban sugar in January.,con and The deficiencies of arrivals in January and Februaryhams.so far as they can at present be estimated are as follows:-Tons Per centJanuary    13,170 44February    9,370 15These deficits follow very heavy deficits in the latermonths of 1917.    There is no stock,whereas there shouldbe at this season a stock in the hands of importers,wholesalers and retailers of, at least, 25,000 tons.Home supplies are very short and other meats and fatsequally so.Estimates of probable future arrivals are of course &quot; subject to considerable uncertainty, but the above estimates of deficiencies may be exceeded, aid there are probable deficiencies on other articles for which, however, it is difficult to give definite figures;   in the case of oilseeds for example it is certain that arrivals this month will fall far short of requirements.Taking the above estimated deficiencies for the three principal articles together, they indicate a total estimated deficiency of nearly 541,000 tons or 28 per cent on arrivals of foodstuffs during the first two months of this year. It is realised that a large part of the deficiency is due to \ieather and internal transport conditions in America, but the deficiency remains.
The resulting position is extremely grave,    The tonnage indent was put forward after drastic reductions had been made, as an estimate of the minimum importation absolutely essential to maintain the foodstuff supply of the population allowing only for physiological requirements and the margin necessary for safety in distribution.    It was definitely stated in the prefa-tory note to the indent that -&quot;The Ministry of Food must be at liberty to vary the figures for particular articles shown in the table, taking more of one and less of another as necessity arises, or, at their option, to ask for other articles in lieu of these.Yet the Ministry of Shipping are not prepared to lifta relatively small additional amount of bacon which wasavailable and for which finance had been secured.In the case of sugar again it is urgently necessary toanticipate February shipments in order to meet a possiblecrisis in February, but the Ministry of Shipping cannotfind tonnage for the purpose.This situation cannot&apos;be allowed to continue, andI must insist that the priority with respect to food, aswell as to finance, granted by the previous decision ofthe Cabinet, shall in fact be carried out in practice.Immediate steps must be taken to provide tonnage on a basiswhich will secure the arrival from March onwards of foodsupplies up to the minimum programme and will also make goodthe deficiencies which are certain to arise in January andFebruary.I suggest that instructions be given that:-(1) Shipments of foodstuffs up to the point indicated below are to be given absolute priority over shipments of all
ether articles, (unless such shipments of other articles are of quite exceptional urgency and have been granted higher priority by the War Cabinet) and tonnage is to be provided for other articles only after full provision has been made for foodstuffs.(2)   This priority for shipments of foodstuffs is to cover not only the tonnage estimated to be needed for arrivals of foodstuffs in each particular month of 1918 up to the programme (totalling 13,056,000 tons) approved by the War Cabinet, but also deficiencies in earlier months of 1918 are to be aadfe good in later months as may be required by the Food Controller,(3)   The programme of food imports is to be regarded as a whole, and the Food Controller may claim priority for shipments of foodstuffs so long as the total lies within the limits defined by Clause 2, varying the amounts o.f particular foodstuffs as necessity arises or as opportunity occurs.RHONDDA.MINISTRY OF FOOD, 21st January 1918.
