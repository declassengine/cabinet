G.T.-3445.WAR     CABINET,PROPAGANDA AMQHSST THE ORGANISED WORKING CLASSQo L.0f   Report received from an Agent of the Separlment of Informatlo^in^Frgijce^At the present moment, there is evidence that increased propaganda amongst the working class of France, the Labour Party, the Socialists etc., is more necessary and important than at any time before during the period of the War.First.   These men, like the proletariat in all countries sare very tired of the Var.Second. They have been profoundly moved by the Russian Revolution and the apparent complete triumph of their most extreme and Utopian ideas.     They ere beginning to wonder if it would not be possible for the Bolshevik, or at any rate, the Kerensky programme to be carried out in all European countries as easily as it was in Russia.   They are as much afraid of the Bourgeois triumph and settlements as the 3olshevik.Third.   They are afraid of a Royalist, or at any rate a bourgeois plot against the liberties of the Republic   The appointment of Clemenceau was not relished by them.     The prosecution of Caillaux has made them worse as they have a deep suspicion of a trial by secret military tribunals, such as will apparently be necessary in thiB case.     The uncon-sidered an(\ violent campaign of L^on Daudet in the ACTIOU ERAKCAIS3, the prohibition (on a well founded rumour) of L!HUMAiiITS and L&apos;0BUVR3 at the Front, certain new high Military and Civil appointments apparently all of Reactionary interest, have also gone far to exciting their fears.Pourth.   The refusal of the Stockholm passports is a deeper and more subtle cause of unrest.     To understand the exact nature tiT the effect of this refusal on Socialist hopes and psychology, it is necessary to give a short resume&apos; of Socialist and Labour history during the V/ar.On the outbreak of the War, owing to the confusion caused by the mobilisation, all Socialist and working class organisa-tions were absolutely disarranged.    Secretaries -;-ere called to the Colours at a moment&apos;s notice - books of minutes and transactions were lost - and for the first month or two of the ?/ar, these organisations may be said to have ceased to exist entirely.     The death of Jauree, however, roused much appre-hension in the proletariat of Prance, who thought that an organised attempt under cover of the r;ar, was to be made to take away their liberties.    A Central Committee for Republican safety was hastily formed in certain parts.   This contained the germs of future developments.     The prompt reassurance of the people by the appointment of &quot;good Republican&quot; Generals and high officials, followed, snd was complete..     The Central Committee occupied itself with questions of a more domestic
character, such as the price of foodstuffs - the facilities of transport, etc.   Gradually, however, tho old organisations were revived.   Men were returned from the Colours and took their places in the   ranks of the Labour movement again. Many new members joined the Trade Unions, and affairs showed evidence of progress, both in numbers and in influence.The question of the Stockholm Conference now arose, and led to the revival of interest in what was before the War the root principle and hope of Socialist action.   Labour in all its manifestations has looked more and more to Internationalism as the solution of its fundamental problems. The proletariat were taught to believe that there was more in common between, say the working man of Germany and the working man of Prance, than between the working man if France and the middle olas3 of his own country.   The working class of all countries was one ard indivisible in interests, modes of thought, problems and hopes.   This was fostered by various International conferences and organisations.   At the out-break of the V/ar these had all gone to pieces, but the feeling and wish for International solidarity wf the working classes remained, as it were, buried.   There were numerous efforts to revive this, principally from Berlin,  the Headquarters of the International Trades Unions Congress, apparently fostered by German Propaganda Punas, and from neutral countries, especially Sweden abd Holland.   The invitation to the Stockholm Conference came as the culminating point in these vague and doubtful revivals of feeling and succeeded in making the Internationalists and their fringes in prance feel their isolation and recalled in their minds the old hopes and ideals. In short they felt a little lonely and cut off.   National feeling was still, however,  strong enough for them to resist this, and it was only a small party that went to a Conference at Kienthal in Switzerland.The majority refused to endorse this action and tooic up a resolute stand against it.   At the outbreak of the Russian Revolution there were therefore, in Prance,  two parties: one a minority,  the &quot;Kienthalian3M,  in whom the International consciousness and desire was fully awake, and a large majority in which It had been loyally put out of mind by the Nationalist and patriotic Awill,The changing fortunes of the Russian Revolution put a different complexion on things.   The Nationalist majority were at first disgusted by the complete failure of the Allied Governments to keep in touch with events in Russia. Henderson, in England,  expressed the desire &amp;f the French proletariat, as well as the English, when he wished to take part in a new Conference at Stockholm,  so that the Russians could be watched, guided, encouraged and assisted.   This feeling had not yet reached the breaking point of a majority vote.   Once more Nationalist will conquered, and the majority, now much reduced, and very resentful, would have voted in Prance as in England against Stockholm.But now a new fear had come which grew every week, a new fear which was a growth of the old one,  that the War Direction in the Entente powers was Reactionary and was definitely against the Social Democracy.   They were afraid that the Russian Revolution was to be crushed because it was too Democratic - because it was a Revolution.   The short-sighted cunning of the TIMES, DAILY MAIL in definitclv accusing
Lenin and Trotsky of being German Jewish spies in. the open pay of the Germanic Powers succeeded for a time; &quot;but now that this &quot;theory&quot; has been given up, the feeling of having been cheated revives.Another demand for passports came, this time for the whole body of Labour, the majority having quite gone over to the Internationalist view once more.   Things were going from bad to worse.This was the position when Lloyd George and Wilson made their speeches on War Aims.&apos;   The effect of Lloyd George&apos;s declaration was extremely good.   The agitation for passports died down at once.   The dread of being kept in the^dguk, and the nightmare of fighting and working for aims/ hey did not know and Increasingly suspected of being Imperialistic and aggressive, were removed.   The effect of -Wilson1 8 fourteen points was much better.   Not only was the fear of mysterious war aims in the Reactionary interest removed, but they were&apos;assured that an idealistic imagination ruled the War Counsels of the Allies,  that they were fighting for a Utopia as much as the -Bolsheviks, and with even more hope of speedily entering Into it. PichonTs speech, though it annoyed them considerably, was only a temporary cold douche..   It is possible that they will raise the barricades against him and Clemenceau but they will fight for the Entente Cause for at least another year, on Lloyd George&apos;s and Wilson&apos;s speeches.The failure of the Bolshevik negotiations with Germany, the clear light in which the uncompromising and treacherous policy of the Central Powers appeared, added to the effect of the Wilson Programme.The organised proletariat in Prance then, from the point of view of Propaganda haB three great fears and one hope.   They are afraid of Reactionary plots In their own Government.   This does not concern us immediately.   They are afraid of being left in the dark,of mysterious War aims, of aggressive Imperialistic designs, (especially England and the German Colonies) of secret Diplomacy, they are afraid- of isolation, of being cut off from their class in other countries, and then of being dealt with separately; and they hope desperately for a new ideal democratic world to be created out&apos;of the War.These are the points at which they can be touched, and at which Propaganda is necessary and would be ,vitally useful.Pirst.   England1s part in the War must be shown to be absolutely ideal and unselfish.   There must net be a breath of suspicion that England intends to profit from the War.   The German Colonies Campaign must be absolutely limited to showing what horrors they committed there, and how unworthy they ire of Colonial possessions.   This side of the propaganda is highly dangerous and difficult, but a little might be done very cautiously.   A much more promising opening for propaganda is a really clever pamphlet or series on English Imperialism considered as an effort in World-Constructive-Democracy - the entirely free development of of nations under its sway, in short something like the Round Table idea with a strong &quot;llsonian and Social Democracy
-t+^^^w inri in aginative reconstructions- of this sort 8f2 d bfw?rkinfmeif^franco at the present moment as never before; as a result of the imaginative stimulus of Wilson&apos;s speeoh&apos;and the Bolshevik movement in Russia.The fear of isolation can also to a certain extent be re-newed.   If the Stockholm   Conference is impossible, a really representative conference of Allied Sooialists etc., called together in a fearless spirit, in New York if possible (this would afford some sort of an excuse for the restrictions of numbers of such a conference), would be an extraordinarily good move at present.This is,  of comi so, outside the scope of everyday Propaganda The isolation fear, with all its evils, could be calmed quite considerably by the appointment of a sort of working class Embasgy in Paris.   This would consist of a small committee of two or three properly accredited Labour Party representatives in Paris, of whom we could be certain, but who would not voice too plainly the completely official attitude,   These men, and this is very important, should have very moderate salaries, just sufficient to keep, them in working class quarters, and in the closest possible touch with the working Class of France.   They would be kept busy attending conferences,&quot; making friends with the leaders of the movement in France, especially Paris, arranging for the visits of outstanding figures of the Labour World in England, and keeping in the closest possible touch with the drift and movement of the Proletariat of France.   It is from them incidentally that the Paris Bureau could learn what printed propaganda is needed and where.   These men should be stronger on the score of their credentials than their oratory -this latter would be supplied by the stream of Labour leaders that they would arrange.   They should be responsible to the Labour Party or, at any rate not Government officials.There is not much definitely British propaganda in all this, but the great necessity is to keep the French Proletariat friendly to England, and enthusiastic for the Allied cause. This can further be helped by making use of this hope of a new world to come from the War which should be fed by elaborations and expansions of the Wilsonian position.VISITS OF OERITISH LABOUR LEADERS. - Visits to French Conferences, have already been made by various British Labour Leaders. These have undoubtedly done good.   The chief faults have been-First. That they have been too short for the visitors to gain any just or accurate idea of French internal Labour affairs.   Tillett especially seems to have had a great many of his ideas as to personalities in French Socialist circles, from some other source than personal experience.--Second. They have usually stayed in the best Hotels in Paris and borne every outward and visible sign of having been bought by a rich bourgeois government.Third, Their credentials have not been sufficiently, satisfactory for the prying eyes of men like Longuet. forth* ^ey have voiced too absolutely and immoderately the official views of their Government, giving rise to the a ?ii?s- hat t^ey ^ mere mouthpieces of that Government. A certain margin of indiscretion and candour must be allowed to give the real atmosphere of genuine untrammelled opinion.
- 5 -179FRENCH MINORITY SOCIALISTS,,   tonguet is the titular leader; Tillett thinks &quot;&quot;he is anti-British &quot;because his mother was a daughter of Karl Marx.   He i3 a confirmed pacifist of a rather sentimental type.   His Bub-party is not by any meana united under his rule, which ho sustains by a constant story of threats of resignation, which are colaly receiver.   H% is not so important a man as ^RRttEIK; who has a great and devoted Trades Union following, mainly cf Engineers.   Though not as clever as LOHGUIiT, he enjoys the reputation of absolute honesty.MAJORITY;^   Apart from these two men, the leaders are favourably disposed to England, or, at any rate, to the English Democracy.   IU BRXEULTH, the Secretary of the Socialist party is inclined to be Anglophile, and will be of great assistance.   Harben, the English Socialist at present employed in Paris by the British Government, has a considerable influence amongst the Labour men in France, an extensive circle of friends and will be of great value.GJTRMAN PROPAGANDA.   There is a good deal of veiled German propaganda literature at present passing amongst the working class of France.   Most of it seems to emanate from the agency of the man who was Secretary of the International Trades Union Congress, whioh had its Headquarters before the War in Berlin.   Most of it i3 the usual pacifist stuff, but there are two or three rather time worn libels which are al-ways kept alive by the Germans.   I am surprised to hear from DU BRIEULTH that the old story of the intention of the English to keep Calais and Boulogne after the War is still one of the most persistent and mischievous of these.   There is further a whole series about the rapaciouB designs of England in the German Colonies, which have probably ouffered aa a result of the Lloyd George speech, and the German atti-tude of Brest Litovsk.In this note there has been an intentional looseness in referring to the working Classes, Labour Party, Trade Unions, Socialists, as if they were synonymous terms.   The whole body of the proletariat, particularly in the large towns is meant, in which the opinions shade from the extreme Internationalist of the Kinority Socialists to the violent national feeling of the men who read Herve&apos; and the VICTOIRE. There is a continual movement amongst all these parties towards the extreme left in different degrees, but always considerable and sustained.(Initialled)   W.R.24th January, 1910.
