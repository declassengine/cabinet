MINISTRY OF SHIPPING CHINESE COOLIESThe whole question of the importation of Chinese Coolies into France was fully discussed at the meeting held at 1Q, Dawning Street on the 18th January) but no decision was arrived at, the Prime Minister considering that the final decision  must rest with tho War Cabinet.     The report of the Meeting (G;T. 5400) and the memorandum by the Ministry of Shipping (G.T. 3368) therein referred to have been circulated*I have already strongly advocated the complete suspension of this traffic, but the question has now became Increasingly urgent in view of the fact that the United States Government is being pressed to send mon to bo embodied in the British Army.    It Is understood that there is a good prospect cf tho United States Government acceding to this request, in which ovent the men are to be carried in British ships.    The ships at present utilised for tho Coolies will have to be used for this purpose, but unless authority is given at once fsr the complete suspension   fit the Coolie traffic, these ships will be out of position and will not be available for the United States troops in time to secure the object of the proposed scheme.(Sgd)   J.P.Maclay h January, 1910.
