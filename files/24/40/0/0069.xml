s DOOUliBffl? IS THE PROPERTY. 02 HIS BBITAHBIO .IL.J5S&apos;J?YfS mV^iOM^BET. W A g   CABIN If,3J69.Memorandum of a Visit to the Western Front.by General Smuts.kt the request- -of the Irime Minister I have paid a visit to British Section of the Western Front.     I left London on day, January 21st, accompanied by Sir Maurice Hankey, and we at six days in visiting the Meld Larshal Commanding, General d Quarters, and each of the four armies in succession from th to South.     I had the advantage if discussing the situation h the Field Marshal and his Staff,, the Army-Commanders, and i of the Corps and Divisional Commanders besides the more im-iant strategical and tactical sections en the front of each i,    I have made a special study of the defensive preparations the whole front, and I sought every opportunity both by per-al observation and .by inquiry to make.myself acquainted v/ith state of the troops,     I hope very shortly to pay another it to France in order to study the system of training and to vlete my inquiries in. regard to some of the technical branches, which time did not suffice in this visit.I do not propose to deal with the larger strategical pro-las ox the Western front in this note, owing to the great recy of the consideration involved, although I shall be glad&apos; m opportunity to discuss them.with my colleagues in the Cabinet.     For the moment I will confine myself to certain ters bearing on the problems to be considered during the thooming meetings at Versailles.I am satisfied that the moral cf the army is good.     The ring of the troops coming in and out- of the line, and in the ?ft working parties all along the front is in every way sat-actory.     The army is well found and in good fettle. -  There ao question, Jxowever, that the men are tired.     This applies e especially to the infantry. -   To a considerable extent the sonnel of the artillery has been rested after the great ig-u.es of the Flanders battle.     The infantry on the other i is not yet sufficiently rested.     All the divisions were ively engaged&quot;in exhausting.offensivt operations during the le of 1917.     Much new ground has beon wrested from the eh-i v/ith the result that entirely now defences, have had to be !-tea on a large proportion of the front, and the tired div-ons had not during 1917 maintained even the&apos; &quot;old. defences at highest level.     The change in the strategical situation, to the collapse of Russia, has necessitated the construction * great new system of defences in depth, the fronts of which, -ost parts of the front, do not correspond with the first trenches.     A defensive system that amply sufficed for an continuously on the offensive, does not meet the defensive s ob the existing- situation, and behind the elaborate sys-oi the main battle zone, reserve defences are being con-*oted. &apos; &quot;&apos; ..
The preparation of, this -vaBt^btit&apos;. absolutely essential scheme of defence, roc; Hires&apos;-en immense amount of lab out.   as tho groater part of the work lias to be done within the sone of artillery lire, native^and prisoner labour cannot be em-   -&apos;. ployed to any considerable&apos; extent.     The burden falls in tho main on the infantry.     Consequently,- divisions which have coin-j:lsted their term--in- the defensive line have, almost&quot;immed-iately, to be turned on- to -the&apos; -construction, of. defence works. The result is that they suffer in. regard both to rest, end train-ing. r-.1- In the circumstances the surprising feature, is not that they are fatigued, but that their spirits are so good.Iii. addition it must be borne in mind that the infantry. , are 100,000 men. below strength until the new organisation has been completed,;Although it is impossible to onsure that the enemy will not break into any. defenses,. however good, as. wc ourselves have proved-,-    I am satisfied that-in .six;-weeks time the. defences, already, strong, will.be such as ;to. enable the army to ronder a good account of itself against-any attack that can be- brought to bear,  / The War Office should has$en the supply of&quot; barbed wire, as existing stocks are depleted.&apos;The point, however, ib.:which I wish to draw attention is that this &quot;heed of rest &quot;is.a psychological factor of-the ut-most importance in relation to the question of-the extension of the line for which ^the French are pressing,   &apos;-Tt Is my de-liber ate- opinion, as the.result - of pa most.careful study of the question, that, if&quot;the army i3 &quot;compelled at the present time to take over any further portion-of the line beyond that already agreed to, and nearly completed, we shall be. running serious risks,     We shall-h:e strainingthe army too far...; luither the defences will :not he completed in time, or the-;&apos;-&apos; essential rest will not be obtained,Paxid the army will not be&apos; in the -state &quot;in which it ought to be&apos;&apos;; fro resist an attack. Moreover, any further extension 6:f the front will cause great discontent among all ranks. -If cub when ,&apos;frho proposed American battalions have been in-oorporated in the British brigades, .1 should be prepared to re-examine.-the question,     I discussed&apos;this&apos;proposal with the Pi old L&amp;rshal Cc^imandingr-in-Chief,- and the Army Commanders and other officers, and I -found a unanimous opinion that the addi-tion of the American&apos;battalions would have &quot;a very beneficial effect on the army, from the moral no&apos;less than from t.he mat-erial point of view,- v te:ei&quot;ience with American hospitals end American labour battalions^.encourages the belief that no fric-tion, due to a different scale pf pay, should result,     I -con-eider it to be of the first&apos;importance that this step.should be taken with the least-/possible-.delay,; and I suggest that further pressure &quot;Should be; put on President t/ilson to hasten a decision.There is one other way in which the cooperation of the -American army might be sought in.order to assist us. in the.solu-tion oi this question of the extension&quot; of- the line, and&apos;-that is by taking over a section&apos; between the; British and Prench armies,
*r? - Oa their man-power difficulties.     I am informed that tho sectionI t c line concerned is a quiet one, Well suited to an array b.e-ijining to lo..rn the business.     I am also informed that this action is moro favourable from a transportation point of view ILn the portion ox tho line in the region of,Nancy, now held7 the Americans, but I have had no opportunity to study this iestiom     Onoe the American army was established at this oiirt, the controversy should be ended for over.One other question affecting the moral oj. the army to ,ich I must allude is the recent Press attack on the higher  / on-inland.     This is greatly pre-occupying the minds of nearlyII the officers v/hom I mot. It was most unfortunate that 36 of the worst and most virulent attacks should havo been:ie in the &quot;Daily kail&quot;, v/iiieh is widely read in the trenches, regard it,as vital to stop these attacks, which are a serious :.nger to the moral of the army *    a continuance of these Stacks-, by undermining tho confidence of tho army in its lead- \\ ;&apos;B, may produce disastrous effects on discipline.     I consider \\ i,,t the War Cabinet should take immediate steps to prevent a     jj petition Ox those attacks.J. 0.8.Ith January, IS 18.
