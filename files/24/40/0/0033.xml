tfoloEel Jone(This Document is the Property of /wHis Britannic Majesiy&apos;s Governs v : /litFORESTRYMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY FOR     SCOTLAND.* * *I find myself in substantial agreement with the/1 9rMemorandum on Forestry by the Minister of Reconstruction ^G.189).I desire to confine my observations to the subject of the Central Authority proposed by the Forestry Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee. They recommend a United Kingdom ad hoc authority for Forestry, situated in Whitehall.   From the point of view of Scotland I desire to say emphatically that this simply will not do.Everyone admits the close alliance of Agriculture and Forestry.   They are supplementary the one to the other, and should be under the same ccntrol.   As recently as 1912 a separate Board of Agriculture for Scot lend, with a Forestry Department, was, after full discussion, in the course of which the opposite view was strongly argued, deliberately sanctioned by Parliament,   To divorce the two now would be highly inexpedient, and, indeed, practically impossible.   The problem would be quite different if it had a-is en at a time when Agriculture in Scotland was controlled, as it used to be, from the English Board in Whitehall.It is said that Forestry has been neglected in Scotland in the past,   while I do not admit that this is so, I desire to point out (a) that for half the period during which Forestry and Agriculture have been controlled in Scotland, tJne nation has been at war, and the staff of the Board of Agriculture has, by reason of its patriotism, been severely depleted:    and (b) that under my administra-tion considerable changes have been introduced in the1. Scottish
Scottish Board of Agriculture with the intention and effect of materially improving the situation.   The Forestry Department, following a useful Indian model, has been divided into two sections, - one Executive, the other Scientific., - and the staff has now been substantially increased.   Both on the Agricultural and Forestry side, the Board has gained public approval and confidence. Its present position is recognised by such leading newspapers as the &quot;SCOTSMAN&quot; and :&quot;GLASGOW HERALD&quot; as materially weakening any argument for a separate Forestry Department in Whitehall..I strongly oppose the change suggested,. Nearly all my Scottish colleagues In the House of Commons would resent it.   Moreover, the Scottish Chamber of Agriculture,, and the Estate Factors&apos; Society have already, by deputation to me., protested against it.   Indeed, I am strongly pressed,from influential quarters, to resist even the minimum of common control implied in an ^Ll&amp;c&amp;tdiOn of the total funds available for Forestry between the different parts of the United Kingdom, by a body representative of the three countries, as suggested in Dr. Ad4ison*s Memorandum,The statements in the Memorandum(G .T .3319) inquestion are, T take leave to say, singularly wide of themark.   Builiings have been erected in Edinburgh foreducational purposes in Forestry, and Forest Nurserieshave been provided for the Aberdeen and Glasgow Agricultur-al Colleges,.   Funds have been made available for the staff,Advisory Officers have been appointed for the whole ofScotland;   and negotiations for a Demonstration Area anda Central Forestry School were in progress at the out-break of war.   During the war all the Forestry staff andtwo of the Advisory Officers of the Board have taken partin the work of the Home Grown Timber Committee, but,2. notwithst anding
not wit list abiding that engrossing task, schemes are in view for the afforestation of an area covering 13,000 acres or thereby:    a Forestry School is being set up: and many other activities are now proceeding.The analogy of the Frenoh Department&apos; of Forests is unsound.   The policy of the British Government has been to decentralise administration in accordance with the different conditions - national and geographical -of the various parts of the United Kingdom.   France is, in an administrative sense, homogeneous.   The United Kingdom is not,Apart from the question of principle, to estab-lish a new, expensive, and remote authority to afforest Scotland, which contains three plant able acres for every one in England, humbly seems to me to be administrative-ly unsound, particularly when thera is in Scotland machinery which only requires to be developed, strengthened, and properly financed, in order to carry out the objects detail-ed in the Memorandum under consideration.   The Central Authority proposed would, I have no hesitation in saying, be disapproved by the large majority of the Scottish people, and would, in point of fact, prove a constitutional monster.ROBERT MUKRO,Scottish Office,24th January, 1918,3.
