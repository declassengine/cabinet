i mi6h . w^p        158(this document is the property ofhis grits nn*-* ^j^tvs government)7SECRET.The Secretary,War Cabinet.I have received the following telegram from. General Sir W.R, Robertson regarding the Joint Note No.12 by the Military Representat-ives of the Supreme War Council.(Sd.) F. MAURICE,D,M.O,General Staff,War Office, S.W.I.25th January 1918.
ftp1SECRET.CLEAR   THE   LINE.Prom:* C .I .G.S(in France.).To:-War Office.Despatched at 12.10 a.a, 25.1.18*Received at 2.35 a.m.25.1.18.1986.With reference to Versailles Joint Note No: 12 January 21st. If note is considered by War Cabinet, D.M.0. should call attention to following points amongst others;(A) I agree generally with the conditions enumerated in paragraphs 4 and 5 as being essential to security of two fronts and granted that all these conditions are fulfilled I still think issuesat stake are so great and balance in our favour is so slight that anything that can be done to strengthen Entente on the Western front should be done.(B) It is very doubtful if American Divisions will arrive at the expected rate.       They are already behind what was expected and information of future progress is generally of unsatisfactory nature.     There is not an American aeroplane or railway wagon yet in France.(C) To-day Petain stated that diminution of personnel will compel further reduction in number of French Divisions in April even if no heavy fighting occurs before, and he must reduce more and earlier if it does occur.(D) We kno\7 that we cannot keep our divisions at strength throughout year even on &quot;9 Battalion&quot; establishment if heavy fighting occurs .(E) Consequently vital conditions in paragraph 4(a) will probably if not certainly be unfulfilled, and it is mainly for this reason that the General Staff have been compelled to advise War Cabinet against undertaking offensive campaign against Turks.(F)
(F) Petain and Haig have worked out and are making necessarypreparations for several local offensives but both deprecate con-tenplating at present a combined great offensive as mentioned atend of paragraph 7- on account of inadequacy of means until farmere American Divisions are here and ready to fight.    To-day wehad long discussion on this point and both Commanders in Chiefpreferred ? policy given in paragraph 70 (B) of our Man PowerReport for the present, though of course they are quite alive tothevalue of having/initiative.(0)   The, best judge of possibilities against Turkey is Allenby and he estimates he cannot do more with his present force than reach -kgm - Tiberias line by July subject to certain conditions as to drafts and progress of railway and that he cannot go eastward of Jordan.     This operation could not be relied to convert Turkish retreat into a rout and final annihilation as mentioned in paragraph 13, nor as suggested in paragraph 10 compel diversion of considerable German forces to this theatre.In order to achieve more than Allenby deems possible and to secure vitally important Hauran district ? properly he will require more divisions.(H) Palestine problem is rightly stated to be one of commun-ications and this is the second reason which has always in-fluenced General Staff against offensive operation because the communications can only be extended very slowly and at expense of European theatres.(I) advantage of eliminating Turkey has never been disputed by anyone.     It is obvious.     But the question is one of possibility and means and of these the vVar Office and Allenby must naturally be the best judges.\ithout additional danger to &quot;estern front necessary divisions cannot be found (vide i-J.. above) and provision of materialwill
will militate against, the transportation improvementa demanded, in paragraphs 4 and 5,Granot should   advise, War Cabinet on this point, (fj) On the. whole. I consider the Versailles paper does not appreciate the (difficulty if not. impossibility cf providing tlhe means required to execute the policy they advocate both in Europe or against. Turkey.   This is not surprising as they do not possess and cannot be expected to possess adequate intimate knowledge.   This is specially -true of the French and Italian, representatives.(JC)   I feel unable, after further careful consideration to Ql/138/395   advise the War Cabinet otherwise than as in paragraph 12 ef my note of Deer 26th last.   I very much regret- this, as I. know hew desirous they are of undertaking an offensive campaign against Turkey but my knowledge of our means and of the general situation compels me to repeat, that such a campaign would be very difficult if not. impossible to prosecute with success and in any cas?? it would further endanger&apos; oiaar -vital position an the Western Front.
