WAR CABINET.

PUBLICATION IN DOMINION NEWSPAPERS OF A WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE WAR SITUATION.

(Memorandum by Mr. Long.)


I circulate, for the consideration of the War Cabinet, a telegram from the Governor General of Canada, in which the su^estion is made that a ?/eekIy statement should be issued under their authority for communication to the Canadian press, giving a general survey of the War situation.At present, no statement of .the kind indicated is 3ent out from the Colonial Office, though frequent telegrams as to the general situation are sent for the secret information of the Governors General of the Dominions and their Prime Ministers.Thus, for some months past, there has been a fortnightly , and more recently a weekly, personal telegram summarizing the whole position.   The Governors General have warmly acknowledged the value to them and the prime Ministers of these telegrams. Within the last few weeks arrangements have been made for somewhat more detailed monthly secret telegrams as to (a) The naval and (b) the military situation.In addition, secret telegrams are sent as occasion arises as to the shipping situation, and also as to the food position, restriction of imports into the United Kingdom, and similar subjects sI should be glad, if possible, to fall in with the eugges-tion in the Governor General&apos;s telegram.    If it is complied with, the information given would, of course., be sent similar-ly to the other self-governing Dominions.   It would also be desirable to guard against needless repetition in telegraphing i.e. if a telegram is sent weekly for publication in the. Press, it might be possible to shorten some of the secret    &quot;\ telegrams now sent without reducing the amount of informa-tion sent.W.RVL.COLONIAL OFFICE,.23rd January,1918. &apos;

Secret,  Var Cabinet have been considering various publicity proposals with the object of encouraging interest and sustaining spirit of the people of Dominion in respect of all measures for vigorous prosecution of the war.
