S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.) E C R E T.CP.  506  (55.). COPY NO.    L.f)CABINET. PENSIONS OF GOVERNORS. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.In paragraph 15 of the memorandum (CP. 500 (55)) which he has circulated to the Cabinet on the subject of the pensions of Colonial Governors, the Secretary of State for the Colonies expresses the hope that I will concur in the view that the changes which he proposes should apply to all Governorships within the meaning of the Pensions (Governors of Dominions, etc.) Acts. 1911 and 1929.    The proposed changes may be briefly summarised as follows:-(a) That in the case of a Governor who has been promoted to his Governorship from an appointment in the Home Civil Service or the Colonial Service the period of service as Governor requisite to qualify for a Governor&apos;s pension should be reduced from ten years to five years.(b) That in the case of an &quot;ad hoc&quot; Governor, i.e. one who has not been promoted to his Governorship from an appointment in the Home Civil Service, or the Colonial Service, discretion should be allowed to the Secretary of State in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to grant a proportionate pension to a Governor who is called upon to retire for reasons of health, etc. before completing ten years service as Governor.
2.      I have carefully examined the proposals put forward by Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister from the point of view of their effect upon the position of the Governorships with which I am more especially concerned. In this connection it seems desirable to point out that, with the exception dealt with below, the &quot;Dominion Governorships&quot; differ from Colonial Governorships in that the former, unlike the latter are normally isolated appointments and do not form part of a definite career. The Governorships with which I am more especially concerned may be divided into the following three classes, with which it will be convenient to deal separately:-(A) The Governor Generalships of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa and the Irish Free State.(B) The Governorships of the six Australian States.(C) The Governorships of Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesia and the High Commissionership for South Africa.3.      As regards (a) it will be remembered that the Report of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of the Imperial Conference of 1926 declared that the Governor General of a Dominion is now the &quot;representative of the Crown, holding in all essential respects the same position in relation to the administration of public affairs in the Dominion as is held by His Majesty the King in Great Britain, and that he is not the representative or agent of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain or of any Department of that Government&quot;. In view of this declaration it would clearly be inappropriate that any charge for the pension of a Governor General of a Dominion should fall upon the
United Kingdom tax-payer0       The case of the GovernorsGeneral of the Dominions should therefore he leftentirely out.of the consideration of the present matter.They have in fact been omitted from the latest Classifica-tion Tables made under the Governors Pensions Acts.-4,      As regards (b) circumstances make it unlikely thatin future &quot;civil service&quot; Governors will ordinarily beappointed as Governors of the Australian States.    it follows that proposal (a)  is not ordinarily    likely tocome into play but proposal (b) might well affect theseGovernorships.    The Governorships of the AustralianStates in general involve the expenditure of a considerableamount of private income and it is usually a matter ofsome difficulty to find suitable persons with the necessaryprivate means willing to accept such appointments.    Thereis accordingly much to be said generally for improving the &quot;conditions&quot; of Australian State Governors, but Ishould hesitate to recommend that proposal (b)  should bemade applicable to them in the sense that service in oneAustralian State Governorship for the usual term (fiveyears) would be considered to qualify for a pension.This would not only   in my opinion throw an unfair burden on the United Kingdom Exchequer but might well be out ofharmony with public opinion in Australia.5.      The three cases in (C). however do. approximate toColonial Governorships.    Ex-Colonial (i.e. colonial service career) Governors have often been selected forthese hitherto, and may well be selected for them infuture (especially in the case of Newfoundland underthe impending new regime).    Indeed the proposal (a) inthe memorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonies may be specially useful in the case of Newfoundland,
6.      Accordingly.. I desire to - support strongly proposal ..(a) .in. the memorandum &quot;by the Secretary oi. State for the. Colonies&apos; -in . view of -its pr-actieal &quot;bearing on the &quot;Dominion Governorships&quot; dealt with In (c) above but as. regards proposal (b) in the memorandum^ X fee] some hesitation in view of its possible consequences in relation to the Australian State Governorships.    I should hope, however, that it would be found possible to avoid such consequences either by suitable wording of the legislation, or by appropriate administrative procedure under it.(Intld.) J. H. T.minions Office, 18th December5  1933.
