THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT), EC RET.CABINET. FUTURE OF CIVIL AIR COMMUNICATIONS Off THE EMPIRE. Memorandum by the Postmaster General.(1) Considerable progress has been achieved by Imperial Airways, who are rightly entitled to much credit for a steady advance in difficult times, and like all my colleagues I share the desire of Sir Eric Geddes to promote the progress of Air transport both on commercial and Imperial grounds.(2) One of the principal objectives of Sir Eric Geddes&apos; memorandum is to secure that the whole or at any rate the great bulk of the letter mail for Imperial destinations served by Imperial Airways should be carried by air.      I do not propose at the present stage to attempt an exhaustive examination of this policy, but I set out below some of the more important factors in the problem.(3) Air mails have recently been developing fairly rapidly, the volume having doubled within the past three years.      The air service now takes some 10$ of the letter mail to and from India and some 20$ in the case of some of the smaller Colonies where the gain in time is exceptionally large.     But if the whole of the first class mail (it,e0 excluding newspapers, printed papers, etc.) were conveyed by air, the weight would be far greater than has yet been in contemplation.     For example, on the Australian route, which includes India and New Zealand, the average (with wide daily variations) would be over 2 tons per day outwards and about 1^- tons a day homewards, and on the African serviceabout.P. 286 (55).
about 1 ton and -g- ton respectively.     Moreover, in addition to the British mails, provision would have to be made for foreign mails which, under the Postal Union Convention, we are bound to carry if tendered.(4) But the crucial question will probably be, as it is now, that of cost.     On the basis of the transit rates laid down by the Postal Union Convention, the cost of the letter mail services between Great Britain and countries on the Indian and South African air routes is  485,000 per annum.     The cost of air- transport at the rates now charged by Imperial Airways would be  4,2 0,000, the ratio being, roughly, 1 to 9.      If Imperial Airways reduced their charges to  5$ of their present level, they would still be more than twice as high as the cost of surface transport, and even assuming that the whole of the existing transport charges could be saved, the transference to air would still involve an increase in cost of the order of  600,000 per annum, of which about two-thirds would be for outward mails chargeable to the British Post Office.(5) In actual fact, under the existing mail contracts the costs are considerably below the Postal Union standard and the additional cost of air transport would be still greater.(6) It has been suggested by Imperial Airways that the simplest method of enabling larger payments to be made by the Post Office to the Company would be to raise the present Imperial postage rate of lg-d. for the first ounce and Id. for each succeeding ounce to E-g-d. per half ounce to all destinations whether served by air or not, the increase being justified by the improvement afforded, and, in effect, to hand over to Imperial Airways the additional amounts thus collected.I confess I am very doubtful of the reception which would be given by the public, and in particular by those who correspond with places which will not benefit by an air service,
to a proposal thus considerably to increase the present preferential Imperial rates, which have been in force for over 30 years, and I should find great difficulty in defending it before Parliament,  especially as the rate proposed would be a good deal higher even than the ordinary foreign rate.(7) Another factor of some importance is the effect of the transference of the letter mail to air upon the mail contracts with the shipping companies.      If the first-class letter mail were conveyed by air,  it is extremely doubtful if a continuance of the present contract with the P. &amp; 0. Company, which covers India, the Par Bast and Australia (in alternate weeks) besides many intermediate Colonies, would be required or justified- for postal purposes alone.      On the other hand, the discontinuance of a regular weekly service to India throughout the year, which might follow the termination of the contract, would raise other issues of importance.      The mail contracts with South Africa and Australia are in the hands of the South African and Australian Governments who would lose about  50,000 and  30,000 per annum respectively by the cessation of the British Post Office contribution.(8) A policy of conveying the whole or the greater part of the letter mail by air would obviously have to be a bilateral one, and it would be necessary to reach agreement with the Dominions and Colonies who are responsible for the routing and. transport of their own outward mails.      South Africa and the East African Colonies are already making a substantial contribution to the subsidy of Imperial Airways, and Australia has undertaken to subsidise the Eastern Section of the new Australian air route.      But India pays nothing towards the subsidy for the present Indian service and comparatively little towards the Australian extension.      It seems doubtful if the Dominions and Colonies generally would be prepared to make anysubstantial
substantial increase in their present contributions or to shoulder a loss through carrying their mail by air at rates of postage which would not cover the cost of transport.(9) To sum up, the ideal of carrying the whole of the letter mail by air at the ordinary rates of postage could at present be achieved only by -(a) heavy contributions from the Exchequers of Gt. Britain, the Dominions and the Colonies involved, which, I should anticipate, none of them would be ready to face;    or(b ) by drastic reductions in the charges made by Imperial Airways which would either seriously affect the revenues of the Company or entail a corresponding increase in Government subsidies.(10) A larger part of the mail would undoubtedly be attracted to the air by a reduction of rates and any reductions which Imperial Airways are ready to make in their transport charges could no doubt be passed on to the public.     But the experience of the Post Office is that lower postage rates are not accompanied by a commensurate increase of carryings, e.g. a reduction of air mail charges to a quarter of the present level would almost certainly not bring four times the present traffic.      Imperial Airways who naturally aim at increasing their revenue.might not be willing to take this risk.(11) While the ideal at which Sir Eric Geddes aims would appear to be-unattainable until the wide gap between the costs of air and tpoq&amp; transport is greatly narrowed,  I think there is much to be said for the appointment of a Committee to examine the whole question and to formulate,  if possible, a policy for the future.K. W.GENERAL POST OFFICE. 1 December 1933.
