THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1933.SECRET. Copy No.     zj^O.P. 297 (33)CABINET. i o \*[E 7623/1329/34 G]; PERSIA.; : I HAD a remarkable conversation to-day with Sir John Cadman, who is much exercised as to our relations with Persia and would make any contribution ho can to help to improve them. The Times published a letter from him on the 8th December, which seeks to mitigate the effect of the deplorable special article about Persia which that newspaper printed on the 28th November. (It appears that the Special Correspondent had arranged to leave Persia immediately after writing the article, and it rather looks as though the Times published it without appreciating the circumstances.) Sir John Cadman has spoken to Major Astor and hopes that the Times will be publishing a second article more favourable to the Shah which can then be telegraphed out to Tehran. Sir John has already telegraphed his own letter to his agents in Persia.On the main subject of improving relations with Persia and bringing about a general treaty agreement, Sir John Cadman expressed the view that these results were not likely to be achieved through the ordinary diplomatic channel. This is not due to any shortcomings in our representatives (with whom Sir John spoke warmly of his experience), but to the fact that the Shah will not see a foreign diplomat. He tells me that Sir R. Hoare, for example, practically never sees the Shah. The reason is that the Shah feels that if he saw the Minister of one foreign country he would have to see all the Diplomatic Corps. He regards the diplo-matists at Tehran as authorised to see his own Foreign Minister, but he resolutely refuses to see them himself. Inasmuch as the Shah&apos;s own Ministers live in mortal terror of their Sovereign and would never dare to say or do anything which might incur his displeasure, diplomatic approach to His Majesty is completely blocked.Sir John Cadman illustrated this thesis by a detailed account of the recent negotiations on behalf of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. His own success in the matter was entirely due to the fact that he waited until the ordinary diplo-matic machinery had run down and then seized his opportunity to see the Shah personally and settled with him in a few days. He says that the Shah is very quick-witted and extremely well-informed, though very passionate in temper. Before Sir John left Tehran, the Shah told him very earnestly that he wanted his (Sir John&apos;s) help again and that he desired to establish close and friendly relations with Britain. Sir John Cadman has, in fact, been helping the Shah recently about the supply of railway rolling-stock from this country he found that the Railway Department at Tehran was being grossly misled and exploited as to the material and design recommended to them by foreign engineers.All this leads up to Sir John Cadman&apos;s unconventional suggestion that the only way to get a satisfactory agreement with Persia is by direct negotiation between the Shah himself and some Plenipotentiary other than the accredited diplomatic representative, whoever this last individual may be. He considers  indeed is confident that if this course could be pursued, an agreement could be rapidly attained.I naturally made the comment that, assuming that this was the correct reading of the position, two difficulties had to be met first, the choice of the Plenipotentiary, and, secondly, arrangements which would preserve the status of our regular diplomatic representatives. On the first point, Sir John Cadman suggested Mr. Eden&apos;s name. Apart from other qualifications, his acquaintance with Persian would make his selection specially appreciated.   I said that such a7136   [9388]
suggestion had, in my eyes, everything to commend it, and would, indeed, get over the second difficulty I had mentioned, but that I thought it impossible for the Under-Secretary to be spared for the purpose. On the other hand, the second of my difficulties could not be easily surmounted unless the man chosen had, owing to his position or past connexion with the Shah, a special qualification which would justify the use of an undiplomatic channel. Had Sir John Cadman considered whether he himself was a possible instrument for the purpose? Sir John replied that he had not made his observations with this in mind, but that he attached so much importance to bringing about promptly better relations on a permanent footing with Persia, not only in the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but in wider British interests, that he would certainly not refuse to be considered if such a choice seemed practicable and desirable. He is, in fact, going out on his Company&apos;s business to Abadan in January or February, and expects to meet the Shah there. He does not profess to know the range of matters which would enter into the negotiation for a treaty, but expressed the view that, if the ground was properly prepared, the interviews with the Shah, which ought to bring about agreement, might not last more than a week. An alternative name mentioned between us in our talk was that of Sir Francis Humphrys, who is fayourably regarded in Tehran. Sir John Cadman believes that  the Shah intends to, visit Bagdad in. the course of next year, and later on to come to Switzerland; the question whether he may extend his visit to this country will, therefore, nop improbably arise.&apos;    &quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;&apos; J.
