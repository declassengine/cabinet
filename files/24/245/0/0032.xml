(this document is the property of His Britannia Majesty&apos;sGovernment).Copy No. 38ecretFTm/33.CABIN JiT.PROGRAMME OP K.;\; INSTRUCTION FOR 1934. Memorandum by the pirst Lord of the Admiralty.In placing before the Cabinet my proposals for the Naval Shipbuilding Programme for 1934, I ought to remind them that although the Programme for 1933 was the last one due for completion by the 31st December 1936 under the London Naval Treaty, the building of now Cruisers, Destroyers and Submarines continues to be governed by the Treaty up to the 31st December 1936.     Until that date, under Article 19 of the Treaty, only replacement tonnage for Cruisers and Submarines becoming over-age before the end of 1939 and for Destroyers becoming over-age before the end of 1938 may be laid down for the British Commonwealth of Nations.2. Under this condition, the maximum Cruiser tonnage whi oh could be laid down before 31st December 1936 (that is in the next three New Construction Programmes) amounts to 86,350 tons: the maximum Destroyer tonnage to 60,500 tons (apart from the operation of the so-called &quot; jjscalator&quot; clause): the maximum Submarine tonnage to 10,486 tons.3. The New Construction Programme which I ask the Cabinet to approve for 1934 consists of -4   Cruisers (3 of &quot;Minotaur&quot; type, about 9 000 tons, and 1 of f,Arethusar* type, about 5,200 tona).1 Leader and 8 Destroyers.1 Aircraft Carrier.
1 Surveying Ship. 7 small vessels (Is (namely, tvitwo Coastal Sloops, three Boom Defence Vessels, a 1 School Tender and aGat e and Bo Submarine 3 Trawlor).4.      As regards the number of Cruisers proposed, it will be recalled that the 1933 New Construction Programme originally included 4 Cruisers, instead of 3 as in previous years, owing to Australians temporary inability to undertake the construction of a Cruiser to replace HoM-AsS. BRISBANE which becomes over-age before the 31st December 1936, and that the Cabinet approved that I should discuss with HroBruce the questions when and in what manner the Commonwealth Government should eventually shoulder its responsibility in the matter.   When, however, it recently became necessary to revise the programme, this fourth Cruiser was omitted in order to conform to the tonnage limitation con-tained in Article 20 of the London Naval Treaty.    It is now proposed to restore the position as originally approved by adding the fourth Cruiser to the 1934 New Construction Programme, since otherwise not only will the replacement of the BRISBANE and my conversations with MroBruce be left in suspense, but the minimum number of 50 British  tapirs Cruisers will not be maintained.5,     As regards the types of Cruisers proposed, I should point out that Japan has laid down 4 of the large 6&quot; gun Cruisers which have necessitated the design of our new MINOTAUR type, and is to lay down two more in 1934. after which she is precluded by Article 19 of the London Naval Treaty from building any more of them before 1937.   The U.3.A- has authorised 4 still larger 6&quot; gun Cruisers,    ifrery effort should be made by us to reach an international agreement which will put a limit to the further building of theso large 6&quot; gun Cruisers, as was done in the case of the 8&quot; gun Cruisers.     .iVen,however, to provide equality with/
with Japan in respect of those which she has already built or projected, it would he necessary to build 6 MINOTAUR type Cruisers.60     The numbers of Destroyers and Submarines proposed to be laid down are the same as in previous Building Programmes since the Treaty, and do not call for fresh comment.7,     It is proposed that an Aircraft Carrier of about 22,000 tonsshould be included in the Programme.   Great Britain was the pioneer in the employment of Aircraft Carriers, and of our present6 Carriers 3 represent early experiments in designing or convertingships as Carriers, and by modern standards are deficient in speed and in the number of aircraft which they can operate.   The U*SoA.and Japan are each laying down-2 new Aircraft Carriers specially designed as such, and unless ws lay down now an up-to-date vessel of this type the position in 1935 will beThe U0iSoA* will have 6 Carriers built and building, only one of which will be more than 8 years of age.Japan, will have 5 Carriers built and. building, none of which&quot; will bo more than 8 years old.Great Britain will have 6 Carriers,&apos; of which 4 will be more than 8 years old.83     The Washington ratio of 5: 5: 3:. applied to aircraft carriers and had the underlying assumption that this wouldapproximately represent the resulting strengths of Carrier-borne aircraft,- but in actual fact we shall be far below the properratio.9.     The Sloops and. the Surveying Vessel aro required in replace-ment of existing vessels whose lives are expooted to expire within the next few years.   It is proposed that the Surveying Vessel should be so designed as to be capable of employment as a Convoy Sloop in time of war.10. Of the small vessels, the Coastal Sloops are of the new and simple type introduced in the 1933 Programme;    the Gate and BoomDefence/
Defence Vessels are for the seaward defences of Singapore and Trincomali;   the Submarine School Tender is to replace H.M.8.-PIGMY, the Tender at Port Blockhouse, which will shortly be beyond repair,II.   A financial statement showing the total estimated cost of the Programme and the manner in which the expenditure v;ould normally be spread oyer the years of building is attached.   It will be observed that although the provision proposod in the first year for starting the Programme is very small, it is larger than has been customary for some years pa^t.   jbrperience has shown that the practice of pushing the orders for all the nev/ vessels into the very end of the financial year is incon-venient for the Admiralty, and is still more inconvenient for the contractors, who could make much more use of the long days and good&apos;weather in the ensuing summer if orders were   placed somewhat earlier. . Incidentally, to place the orders early in the year would be advantageous from the standpoint of employ-ment:    extra employment-would of course be of the greatest benefit in January and February.     I should like, therefore, to be able to place the orders for two. of the -Cruisers and the Leader and Destroyers included in.this Programme round about Christmas 1934, and those-for some of the smaller vessels still earlier0(Initialled)   B. 3d.Admiralty, S 3 Wd *21st December, 1933.. -
