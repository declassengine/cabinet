THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1933.SECRET.Copy No.    4(1CP. 294 (33).CABINET.1 ft ^THE DISARMAMENT POSITION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.1. THE Cabinet will wish to have some report of recent action regarding disarmament. In accordance with the Cabinet decision on the 22nd November, 1933 (Cabinet 64 (33), Conclusion 1), the Ministerial Committee has had this matter in hand and the main events up to date are the following : (1) A Sub-Committee of the C.I.D. reported on the technical aspects of Chancellor Hitler&apos;s new proposals. This report was then considered by the Ministerial Committee, and the report of the latter on the subject is now circulated (OP. 291 (33)).(2) A telegram of the 7th December (copy attached as Appendix I) was despatched to Berlin, and Sir E. Phipps will take the earliest opportunity of seeing Chancellor Hitler and putting before him these preliminary observations on the latter&apos;s proposals. We had the advantage of Lord Tyrrell&apos;s presence in London before the terms of this telegram were finally settled.(3) Before sending off this telegram, I saw the French Ambassador and gave him a full explanation of our attitude, at the same time handing him a copy of the telegram for the information of his Government. (Record of the conversation with the French Ambassador is attached as Appendix II.)(4) Italy and the United States have also been informed of our action.-(5) Mr. Henderson arrived from Paris&apos; on Thursday last; Mr. Eden and I saw him the next day. He told us that he had found the French Government much exercised about our recent attitude. Our unwillingness to stand strictly by the suggestions of the 14th October still rankled. We reminded him that the situation in this respect was cleared up at Geneva, with his own assistance, and, as we understood, approval. I think it is clear that the impression which Mr. Henderson has derived is not really due to the failure of the October suggestions, but. to French anxiety as to whether we are contemplating as a possibility an agreement which would involve some German rearmament. I told Mr. Henderson that we had been busily engaged in collecting information as to the views of different Governments. He strongly urged that we should not limit our communications to the diplomatic channel, and I said that I had in mind the possibility of going abroad when tlreJTouse rose and might spend a couple of daysDr. Benes is to arrive in Paris on the 14th December, and I think I may ask him to visit London on the following week-end. Mr. Henderson is specially interested in (a) the proposals for guarantees as to the loyal execution of any disarmament convention, i.e., economic and financial pressure to be applied if the Permanent Disarmament Commission finds that a serious breach has occurred; and (6) supervision. Dr. Benes is rapporteur on two other matters, viz., the duration of the Convention, and the reduction of land armaments.before going further afield.7131   T93771B
(6) At the interview with M. Corbin I was able, also, to inform him that, if the Cabinet approved, the Departments specially concerned would be prepared to let the French Government know what part of the French dossier on German rearmament we were in a position to confirm, and what were the items, if any, which we could not confirm. In view, however, of the decision of the Ministerial Disarmament Committee (D.C. (M.) (32), 20th Conclusions), quoted below, a decision from the Cabinet is now needed on this point: French Request for Joint Consultations between Experts.&apos; (a) To accept the view expressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that in no circumstances should we offer to disclose informa-tion in our possession to the French, as this would compromise its source. Such a decision could, in any case, only be taken by the Cabinet.(b) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in answering this request, should endeavour to discourage further pursuit of this proposal, and, in particular, might ask the French if they had considered the consequences of such an examination, and whether they were prepared, or desired, to face these consequences.2. The present report is limited to recent action, but I must point out that very large issues remain to be considered apart from the course of disarmament negotiations. Of these, the biggest, and -perhaps the most difficult, is raised by Signor Mussolini&apos;s demand for changes in the constitution of the League. The recent despatch of Sir Eric Drummond from Rome is of special interest in this connexion.* It is a matter of urgent consideration to decide how this new issue is to be dealt with. Telegram No. 371 of the 7th December from Rome makes it plain that the Italian Government have no definite plans of any kind for League reform; they intend to study what proposals can be put forward. The most serious aspect of the whole matter seems to me to be that the attacks on the League made by Germany and Italy do not necessarily indicate a desire to reform the constitution of the League by regular and authorised means, but conceal a policy of freeing their hands for the purpose of claiming frontier revision.J. S.Foreign Office, December 8, 1933.* Despatch No. 1)28 of December 1, 1933.
APPENDIX I.1 0 illSirJohn Simon to Sir E, Phipps (Berlin).(No. 238.   Very Confidential.) : Foreign Office, December 7, 1933.   &apos;.1 MY telegram No. 230 and your telegrams Nos. 97, 98 and 99, Saving, and Nos. 269, 274 and 275.You should seek the earliest opportunity for seeing the Chancellor again, informing him that you are now in a position to tell him that His Majesty&apos;s Government have given careful consideration to his proposals and desire to convey to him their preliminary impressions.These proposals have two aspects, one concerned with the limitation of armaments and the other with the wider field of political appeasement. I will deal first with the second of these aspects, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government attach the utmost importance.His Majesty&apos;s Government entirely agree with what would seem to be the&apos; Chancellor&apos;s view, namely, that the achievement of a disarmament agreement would be immensely facilitated if it were accompanied by political assurances calculated to improve and consolidate good relations between Germany and her neighbours. The question then arises how this can best be achieved ? We should he interested to have further details as regard precise terms and form of the non-aggression pacts which the Chancellor has in view. Needless to say, members of the League cannot enter into any such arrangement as would be inconsistent with their obligations under the Covenant. The list of countries with whom Germany would negotiate such pacts, as given in your telegram, does not include all the limitrophe States.   We presume, however, that these would be included.Turning to the part of the Chancellor&apos;s proposals which is concerned with technical questions of armed strength, we would first make two observations.Our final conclusions as to various items and figures could naturally only be reached as the result of completing the consultations between different Powers in which Germany herself is taking part. Secondly, world opinion will compare these proposals with those contained in the Draft Convention to which Germany, in common with other Powers, gave her adherence in principle, on its first reading.In the light of the above reflections, you should point out that the proposed increase from 200,000 to so large a total as 300,000 will certainly be considered excessive, while the suggestions in respect of guns and aircraft also look very formidable. We should like it to be quite clear that the S.A. and S.S. would be absorbed in the new army and would not continue to exist as supplementary organisations. Again, while we assume that the Reichswehr will disappear as such, it would be helpful if the Chancellor would confirm this. His Majesty&apos;s Government are glad to note that the Chancellors proposals would include general supervision, but it would tend to clearness if it were made plain that this super-vision is of the kind usually described as periodic and automatic. Other Governments may, of course, have other observations to make or elucidations to request, and our own observations are not intended to be exhaustive.His Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly desire to use the present opportunity to hammer out without delay, in co-operation with Germany and other States, a practical basis for agreement for limitation of world armaments, freely entered into by all parties. The enquiries they have addressed through you to the Chancellor will, they hope, be found helpful in the pursuit of this common task.(Repeated to Paris. No. 232; Rome, No. 401; and Washington, No. 508.)[9377]
APPENDIX&apos; II.Sir John Simon to Lord Tyrrell (Paris).i^o, 1888.)My Lord. Foreign Office, December 7, 1933.I ASKED M. Corbin to see me this afternoon. I first referred to the request made to us by the French Government some time, ago that we should join in an examination of the French dossier as to German rearmament in breach of the Treaty of Versailles (see my despatches No. 1834 of the 27th November and No. i860 of the 1st December). I repeated to the Ambassador our regret that, owing to pressure of urgent preoccupations, we had not been able to deal siatisfactorily with the matter before. The Departments specially concerned had nOw been more fully consulted, and I hoped to be able, after the next meeting of the Cabinet, to give him an answer on the matter which would meet as far as possible the French point of view. Provisionally and confidentially I told him that we hoped to be able to indicate to the French Government the points in the French dossier which we were able to confirm and whether there were others as to which we disagreed. I understood that, for the most part, the matters referred to in the dossier were confirmed by our own authorities. M. Corbin hinted that there might be further material as to which his Government desired our views/but I said that, of course, we could not decide in advance how to deal with matters which had not been put before us.2. I then disclosed to the Ambassador the main purpose of our interview, which was to communicate through him to his Government the nature of the communication which we were proposing to make to Chancellor Hitler by way of reply to the proposals which he had put before us, amongst other Governments. After explaining the circumstances and reasons of our intended action, I handed him a copy of telegram No. 238 to Berlin of to-day&apos;s date, impx^ssing on him the extremely confidential character of my own communication, since, while we desired to inform the French Government in advance of anyone else, it was essential that nothing should be revealed in advance of Sir E. Phipps&apos;s visit to the Chancellor when the communication would be made.3. In placing before M. Corbin the circumstances and reasons for our action, the main points which I made were the following : We have now ascertained beyond question that Chancellor Hitler&apos;s suggestions, such as have been communicated to France, Italy and the United States, as well as ourselves, must be regarded as a real offer. His proposals had been first advanced some weeks ago, and, as the French Government knew, we had already informed Chancellor Hitler that we were giving them our careful consideration. The next step must therefore be our comment upon them. And this was very urgent, for Sir E. Phipps had warned us that further delay might result in the German Chancellor making a public announcement of his demands and complaining that he met with no adequate response. It was therefore quite clear that we must at once deal with the matter by a further communication to Chancellor Hitler himself. In settling the terms of our communication, we had in mind to keep Chancellor Hitler in play while avoiding any language which could be misconstrued as either accepting his proposals or seeking to develop any special Anglo-German bargain. But we were firmly convinced that the achievement of a disarmament agreement would be immensely facilitated if it were accompanied by political assurances calculated to improve and consolidate good relations between Germany and her neighbours. We therefore laid special stress in our communication on this aspect of the matter, and urged that Chancellor Hitler should develop his ideas further on this head. At the same time, we were fully alive to the importance of securing that bilateral pacts against aggression should not conflict with obligations under the League Covenant. We were also noting that, though Chancellor Hilter had proposed such pacts with France, Poland and Czechoslovakia, he had not mentioned Germany&apos;s other neighbours. I need not repeat the explanations which I gave to the Ambassador about the rest of the telegram since its terms speak for themselves.
4. M. Corbin expressed the thanks of his Government for this communica-tion, and his words showed that he clearly appreciated that we had determined to send this message but were most anxious to inform the French in advance and before anyone else. He naturally added that he could not himself express the view of his Government on the matter, but he did advance a comment of his own. He said that it seemed to him that this communication might be taken as surrendering the position that rearmament was to be resisted at all costs and as admitting as the basis of negotiation proposals for the positive increase of armaments (see in this connexion his observations at our previous interview recorded in my despatch No. 1877 of the 4th December). I replied by referring to Mr. Baldwin&apos;s analysis in a recent speech of the three possibilities- (1) That the heavily-armed States would come down to the level and list permitted to Germany by the Treaty of Versailles;(2) That a level should be fixed by agreement intermediate between this level and the present level of the highly-armed Powers; and(3) That there should be no agreement at all, with the result that an unlimited race of armaments would follow.It seemed to us that this analysis was both just and complete. There was no fourth possibility, as was sometimes said or supposed, such as that Germany should not be &apos;&apos; permitted &apos;&apos; to change her armaments while the heavily-armed nations would retain theirs. With the United States, Japan and Soviet Russia out of the League and with Germany withdrawn and Italy more than half out, the suggestion that the League should not &apos;&apos; permit &apos;&apos; German rearmament seemed to us illusory, for how was it to be prevented ? We fully appreciated the import-ance of Anglo-French co-operation, and at all times stood for it and meant to maintain it as far as possible, but would even a joint declaration that Germany should not rearm have the necessary compulsory effect ? It was therefore not any failure to appreciate either French anxieties or the actual condition of affairs in Germany that led us to believe that the only practical solution was by agreement to which Germany would be a willing party. We well understood that promises were not a guarantee that the promise would be observed, but we did attach immense value at the present stage to an agreement signed by Chancellor Hitler himself, both because this would commit present-day Germany in a way in which she would certainly not regard herself as committed by previous German signa-tures and because, whatever the future might have in store, Chancellor Hitler&apos;s present declarations of peaceful intentions could not be ignored and were, we believed, a reflection of the present German temper. But if advantage was not taken of any opportunity that presented itself now, then no one could be sure that the German attitude would not change, with the result that future prospects of peace would be damaged beyond repair.5. M. Corbin listened attentively, but made no extended comment, though he observed (as he had observed to me before) that there was a serious difference between German rearmament in the face of Anglo-French opposition and the situation which would arise if German rearmament was based on a new agreement which would in its turn be taken as a starting-point for further claims.I am, &amp;c.JOHN SIMON.
