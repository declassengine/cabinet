k(i) Dospatch from Mr.  de Valera.&apos; DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS IRISH FREE STATE.29th november 1933.Despatch No.  142. Sir ,I have the honour to refer to the statement made by you in the House of Commons on the 14th instant in reply to a question relating to the dispute between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State.2. On that occasion, having stated that theBritish Government were advised that the Bills to amend the Constitution of the Irish Free state, then before the Oireachtas, conflicted in important respects with the Treaty of 1921, you declared that the Irish Free State as a member of the Commonwealth was completely free to order her own affairs.    You also said that it was the desire of the British Government to see the Irish Free State taking her full share as a member of the Commonwealth, not grudgingly but of her own free will, accepting the responsibilities and enjoying the privileges.    You added that if the Irish Free State renounced the responsibilities she could not hope to enjoy the privileges of membership.3. Following this statement the Government ofthe Irish Free State feel obliged to make clear beyond any possibility of doubt the attitude of the irish people towards the British Commonwealth.    The irish people have never sought membership of the Commonwealth.The Right honourable the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Downing Street, LONDON, S.W.I.
Their association with Great Britain and the Commonwealth has never on their side been a voluntary association.      In every generation they have striven with such means as were at their disposal to maintain their right to exist as a distinct and independent nation, and whenever they yielded to British rule in any form they did so only under the pressure of overwhelming material force,4. The Treaty of 1921 involved no fundamental change intheir attitude0      They submitted to the Treaty because they were presented with the alternative of immediate war.      They did not accept it as a final settlement of their relations with Great Britain-      Still less did they regard the Treaty in the sense in which the British Government seek to interpret it - as giving Great Britain a permanent right to interfere in their constitutional development.5. The experience of the last twelve years has made itabundantly evident that lasting friendship cannot be attained on the basis of the present relationship.      The Government of the Irish Free State infer from your statement of the 14th instant that the British Government also now realise the evils of a forced association and have decided not to treat as a cause of war or other aggressive action a decision of the Irish people to sever their connection with the Commonwealth. This attitude of the British Government appears to the Government of the Irish Free State to be of such fundamental importance that it should be formulated in a direct and unequivocal statement.      The Government of the Irish Free State would sincerely welcome such a statement.      They believe that it would be the first step towards that free and friendly co-operation in matters of agreed common concern between Great Britain and Ireland which ought to exist between them.I have j etc.,(Sgd.) EAMON de VALERA. Minister for External Affairs.r-2-
(ii)   Draft reply to the Irish Free State despatch prepared by the Irish Situation Committee of the Cabinet,,Sir jI have the honour to state that your despatch No.  142 of 29th November has received our careful consideration.2, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomcannot accept the description of the relations between the two countries set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of your despatch.      They have stated their view as to the 1921 settlement in my despatch of 9th April 1932 in the following words:-&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom entered into the 1921 Settlement with the single desire that it should end the long period of bitterness between the two countries and it is their belief that the Settlement has brought a measure of peace and.contentment which could not have been reached by any other means.      Further, as the direct result of that Settlement, the Irish Free State has participated in and contributed to the notable constitutional developments of the last few years, whereby the position of the Dominions as equal Members with the United Kingdom of the British Commonwealth of Nations under the Crown, has been defined and made clear to the world&quot;.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom would point out that the Treaty Settlement was duly accepted by the elected representatives of the people of the Irish Free-State, and that its acceptance was subsequently confirmed at succeeding General Elections
in the Irish Free State.      The period which elapsed between 1921 and 1932 was marked by the progressive development of friendly relations and co-operation between the two countries.4. As to the future, paragraph 5 of your despatchis in effect an enquiry whether His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have decided not to treat &quot;as a cause of war or other aggressive action&quot; a decision of the people of the Irish Free State to sever their connection with the British Commonwealth.      In reply I have to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have taken no decision, and feel themselves under no obligation to take a decision, upon the course which they would take if the Irish Free State were to repudiate its Treaty obligations in the manner suggested. 5. Apart, however, from any other consequences of sucha step it is right that I should draw attention to some of the results which must inevitably ensue if such a severance took place, though I need hardly state that we should view with the most profound regret the occurrence of these consequences.6. If the Irish Free State should become a Republicshe would be a foreign country and in economic matters would have to be treated as a foreign country.7. The citizens of such a Republic would cease to be british Subjects.      They would then become subject as aliens to the provisions of the Aliens Restriction Act, by which they could not enter or remain in this country without special sanction, registration with the Police, restriction of employment and liability to deportation as provided by that Act.      They would become ineligible for
8*employment in the Public Services of the Crown either in this country or in the Colonies, and they would no longer be entitled to the benefit of the protection or facilities offered by the British Diplomatic and Consular Services. They would also be ineligible for the Franchise. 80 Although your despatch in terms refers to &quot;Ireland&quot;and 1*the Irish people&quot; I must make it clear that this reply is concerned only with the position of the Irish Free State,I have the honour to be, Sir,Your most obedient,humb1e servant,
