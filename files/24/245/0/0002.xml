THIS._nQgIMgJlT.-IS.....THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).S_B_.G_R._E_T.Negotiations between India and Japan in &quot;resard to the Cotton Trade.Memorandum by the,,^Secrotary.....of..,,S^a.te,...for........India,.The Japanese trade negotiations which have been proceeding in India for several weeks have now reached a critical stage.    In the case of cotton goods it has been agreed that in return for an off take of Indian raw cotton up to a maximum of 1.500.000 bales the Japanese shall be allowed to import up to a maximum of 4-00,000,000 yards, this quota varying with the amount of raw cotton purchased. The quota of imported goods has5 by agreement, been divided into four categories, namely, greys 4-5 per cent, bordered greys 13 per cent., bleached 8 per cent. , and coloured 34- per cent.    It has further been agreed that these percentages should not be absolutely rigid but that in the case of each category a &quot;tolerance&quot; should be allowed sc that if for any reason the quota under any particular category was not reached the quota under another category might, within certain limits, be increased.    It is in regard to these limits that the present difficulty has arisen.the case of each category the tolerance should be fixed at 10 per cent, of the percentage allotted to skhat category.    In the case of bleached goods, so important to Lancashire, this would mean that imports might be increased up to 8.8 per cent, of the total quota or to a maximum of 35.2 million yards.    On the 21st November the Japanese put forward what they called their &quot;final and definitive&quot; proposals. These I need not describe in detail but need only say that the Government of India on a number of points do not intend to give way.    In regard toCopy No.CP.282(33).9CAB I NET.The Government of India originally suggested that inthe
the &quot;tolerance&quot; the Japanese proposal is that this should be fixed in the case of each category at 10 per cent, of the whole quota.    If this were accepted it would be possible for them to import up to 18 per cent, of the total quota in the form of bleached goods, i.e. 72 million yards.It will be seen from the first of the three telegrams which I circulate that a few days ago the Government of India, in their anxiety to safeguard the cotton-growing in-terests in India, proposed to grant a tolerance of 5 per cent, of the whole quota - in other &quot;words to allow the import of bleached goods to rcrch a figure of 52 million yards. After consulting the Foreign Office and the Board of Tra.de I sent my telegram of the 24th November urging the Government of India to reconsider the matter but this was crossed by the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of the same date which proposes to concede in full the Japanese demand for a tolerance of 10 per cent, of the total quota.The President of the Board of Tra.de will no doubt explain the effect of these various proposals on the Lancashire trade;    I am more concerned with the political results that might follow if as I am informed, Lancashire regarded the concession which the Government of India, now propose to make as disastrous to their trade. An excellent effect was produced by the evidence given recently before the Joint Select Committee by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce when that body for the first time abandoned its hostility to the Fiscal Autonomy Convention. If that hostility be revived by an agitation in Lancashire I greatly fear that those who are opposed to the White Paper would seize upon this to further their aims.There is one other point.   My colleagues will remember that it has been decided that any agreomen   reached in India would only bo initialled there but that signature would take place in London.   This adds a new complication to the application of the Fiscal Autonomy Convention, and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentmi ght
might well bo placed in a very awkward position if any strong agitation a. gainst signature developed.S. H.2?th November 1933.
Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated 23rd November 1933&apos;8D1-S.Private and personal.   Our official telegram of 21st November conveyed to you terms of latest Japanese proposals. These have been subject of most careful examination in Council, and following paragraphs set forth our conclusions thereon and considerations which weigh with us in arriving at these conclusions.2. Proposal to which Japanese undoubtedly attach greatest importance is that in respect of percentages to be allotted to categories into which quota is divided. They have accepted our classification into four categories and basic percentages of 45, 13? 8 and 34? but ask to be allowed to transfer up to 10 per cent, of total quota between categories.3. When, in deference to your views, we proposed that transfers as between categories should be restricted to 10 per cent, of the percentage total quota allotted to each category, we were greatly influenced by your opinion that break with Japan on the question of categories and percentages was most improbable. Since then depreciation of the dollar has introduced a new and most important factor into the situation which may explain very definite hardening in Japanese attitude which has manifested itself in the past few days.    It now seems not merely possible but probable that they will break off negotiations unless we go some way to meet their latest proposals.   As you realise, we c^ild not lightly contemplate break, which may involve continuance of raw cotton boycott.4, Our Indian millowner advisers suggested thatpercentage of total quota to be allotted to bleached goods (inwhich Lancashire. is of course mainly interested) should be 10per cent.   Under our latest proposals maximum attainable wouldbe 8.8 per cent.    If therefore negotiations break down by reasonof uncompromising adherence to our latest proposal, it would inevitably, and with justification, be contended in this country that they had been allowed to break, with possibly disastrousresults to Indian cotton grower, because we had endeavoured tosafeguard
safeguard Lancashire interests, and in doing so-had gone beyond what our own millowners considered necessary. We regard with utmost dismay any possible addition to the already heavy burden of agriculture which may result from breakdown of negotiations and continuance of boycott of Indian cotton. The results would be disastrous, and effect on minds of loyal elements represented by agricultural classes would be worsened, if it was represented, as it inevitably would be, that we had placed Lancashire before India, our position would be indefensible.5. In these circumstances, we feel that we have no option but to revive proposal communicated to you in our 2657s 10th November, namely to allow transfers between categories up to limit of 5 per cent, of total quota in respect of each-category, provided that total quota is not thereby increased. We feel that this proposal is not unfair to Indian industry and that, if it is less welcome to Lancashire than our previous proposal, it will be of benefit to both Indian and Lancashire industries if, by preventing a breakdown, it ensured a market for Indian cotton and increased purchasing power tc cotton grower. The ruin of Indian cultivator would be a much more serious calamity for Lancashire and for Indian millowners than the disadvantage involved in our proposed concession.    Some of us, indeed, consider that neither India nor Lanca.shire would suffer,, even if full 10 per cent, transfer asked for by Japan were allowed and on the contrary both would share in the benefit of increased prosperity of agriculturist resulting from larger purchases of cotton.6. The implications of our proposal are as follows;-on assumption that maximum quota would be imported (it is doubtful whether it could) Japan might import a total of 52 mil] ion yards of bleached goods in a year.    In the last fiscal year, she sent 12,0 million yards so that, apart from improvement in price that may be expected from restriction of Japanese imports,Lancashire
j-Lancashire position would be bettered by elimination of 70 million yards of competitive imports. As compered with position under our last proposal she is only potentially 17 million yards worse off.7. While therefore we regret the necessity for a proposal which in any degree may be regarded as disadvantageous to Lancashire and ?/hich may therefore increase your difficulties, we cannot hesitate in choosing a course of action which we consider essential for the welfare of the millions of our agriculturists rather than one which involves the gravest of dangers to these cultivators and to India as a whole for the sake of a net very important and, most probably, transitory benefit to Lancashire. We feel assured that you will realise the dangers and the difficulties of the present situation and we trust that you will find it possible to acquiesce in our proposal.8. It is possible that our offer may not avert a break but if break should occur we feel confident that we can meet any critics of our actions from within India and without. We have endeavoured to safeguard all Indian interests holding the scales evenly while at the same time we have gone as far as possible to offer Japan terms which by common acceptance would be perfectly reasonable.As regards other Japanese proposals we have few comments to offer.    Proposal 2 is an acceptance of our own offer. Cn proposals 3 and 4- we are not prepared to make any concession. Proposal 5 is obscure in its phraseology but pending its further elucidation we are of opinion that we should concede nothing which would fetter our discretion in respect of the imposition of duties for revenue Dr safeguarding purposes. Proposal 6 we are prepared to accept provided it is agreed that terms qf general agreement shall remain in force for period agreed upon whether or not Burma separates.   By Proposal 7 a general principle is said to be enunciated which it is understood\ might
Telecram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, &quot;dated 24th November 1933.804-S.Private and personal. Since my private and personal telegram of yesterday, 801-S, we have received copies of Snow&apos;s messages and I considered the matter so important that I discussed it in Council and send you our unanimous views,Snow&apos;s messages merely confirm our dele gation&apos;s impression of Japanese attitude and intentions.    Of the two&apos; conditions mentioned in Snow&apos;s telegram 324 dated 22nd November to Foreign Office in London, we could not possibly agree to withdrawal of our proposals in regard to future fluctuations in yen exchange.     If break came on this point, we should, we believe, have the country behind us, as also responsible opinion elsewhere.    The case is otherwise with other conditions, viz. transfers between one category and another. Question here is whether we should adhere to proposal already put forward by us to the Japanese or modify it on the lines suggested in our telegram of the 10th instant, 2657s or agree to present request for 18 per cent, for bleached goods. First would involve a maximum import by Japan of 35*2 million yards of bleached goods. Second, a maximum of 52 million, and third a maximum of 72 million. We have come to the conclusion, now that the consequences of itsnon-might be subject to exceptions, for example, rice in the case of Japan. We do not propose to accept such one-sided bargain.9. We would refer you however to last sentence of Proposal 1.   The object of proposal is to permit import in any hell-year of total yearly allotment of any category provided total yearly instalment is not exceeded. We do not propose to agree.   We should be glad of an urgent reply as we should like if possible to answer Japanese on Saturday.
non-acceptance seem to be clears that the third alternative, viz. 18 per cent, for bleached goods should be accepted.    Our reasons are these,   firstly, we could not possibly justify acceptance of grave consequences of a. breaking of negotiations on the ground, that it was vital to us to secure an extra 37 million yards of bleached goods. Though the importation of this yardage might be unwelcome to Indian mills, its exclusion is by no means a vital matter to them&apos;.    On the other hand, if, as seems likely, course of dollar exchange results in serious invasion of our other foreign markets for cotton, the loss of Japanese demand in addition might well create a disaster of the first magnitude in this country. Secondly, the advantage that might accrue to Lancashire from our risking such a disaster would be extremely doubtful. As set-off against such share of extra 37 million yards as might go to Lancashire, after allowing for increase of Indian production, would have to be placed hostility that would be aroused in this country from conviction that consideration for Lancashire&apos;s interests was responsible for the plight of the cotton growers.    Propaganda of Japanese traders would merely help to add volume and intensity to criticism already appearing in this country that India1s interests are being sacrificed to Lancashire&apos;s. This it would be difficult to meet successfully as in larger interests of India we would certainly, if Indian millowners alone were concerned, accept Japan&apos;s proposal in present circumstances.Hostility referred to above would undo much of the good that has resulted from the visit of the Lancashire delegation end opposition in the Legisl;; ture to grant of preferential treatment to- 98 piece goods would in all probability upset our plans to assist Lancashire:.    In Lancashire&apos;s own interests it would hardly be worth while risking these consequences for the sake of obtaining a share 37 million yards which would bo competed for between India and Lancashire.   Lastly it must beremembered
remembered that purchase of one and a half million bales by Japan would increase the purchasing power of the agriculturists to the benefit both of Lancashire and Indian millowners, while material reduction of such purchasing might well nullify the advantage of securing even total elimination of Japanese from Indian textile market.For these reasons we are now satisfied that it would be against Indian interests to refuse l8 per cent, of quota to be allocated to blea.ched goods.We are summoning our non-official advisers who represented cotton growers and the.mill industry, and must consult them before giving a final reply to the Japanese. This will not now be possible before Tuesday at the earliest, We earnestly hope that it will be possible for you to agree math us,
Teleeram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 24th November J933*2917&apos;        Private and personal.   Your private and personal telegram N0.8OI-S dated 23rd November.    I have consulted Board of Trade and Foreign Office. The Board of Trade view is as follows:-The Government of India must, of course, decide and, if necessary, be able to defend their decision by reference to Indian interests, but in considering the matter they are clearly entitled to take account of the possible reactions of their decision on the general trading and other relations of India with the United Kingdom, and the following observations are made from this point of view.The Japanese 10 per cent, proposal and the Governmen of India 5 per cent, proposal do not in the minds either of Lancashire or of Japan merely provide for a tolerance to even out ordinary trading fluctuations,&apos; but go much further and provide a loophole for the transfer of a very considerable yardage from the plain greys category, in which, owing to height of Indian duties, the Japanese are afraid they will not achieve their full quota, to the other categories, in particul bleached goods, at the expense of Lancashire.    Prior to 1930, Japanese trade in this category was negligible, 9 million yards in 1929 and 4*3 million yards in 1928, and as Lancashire always supposed that the category percentages would bear some relation to the trade of the period to which the total quota is related, an arbitrarily fixed percentage on a much higherle
level which will enable Japan to consolidate the major part of the increased trade of 1930 will give rise to considerable disappointment. This disappointment would, it is feared, prejudice the good feeling which is essential for the continuance and development of goodwill here towards imports from India as well as for &quot;the success of the efforts for a greater of f-take of Indian cotton by Lancashire, and for the co-operation with Indian millowners in development of the Indian trade with the Colonies.It is hoped therefore&apos; that on the general grounds of the economic and political relations between the United Kingdom, India and the Empire, of which one expression is to be found in the Ottawa Agreement, the Government of India will be able to decide from the Indian point of view to stand firm on their last proposal.       If some concession must be offered, we. should not object to an offer to reconsider the duties on the plain greys category if the Japanese fears should prove well founded that the present duties will preclude them from reaching their quota.2. The Foreign Office are unable to estimate the likelihood of the Japanese   breaking off negotiations.   Having regard to the offers already made they are not disposed to rate the political risks of a breakdown unduly high provided that in fact the Japanese would continue to enjoy reasonable trade. But from their point of view it would be desirable if a breakdown occurs that it should be on a position which the Government of India would be able to defend from the Indian point of view whether on broad or narrow grounds. They will of course be prepared to rebut strongly the Japanese suggestion that the Government in the United kingdom  have no ri ght to represent United Kingdom interests to the Government of Indiabut
but would be embarrassed if they had todefend a position which was not supported by India on the basis of her general interests.3. These are the views of the two departments. For my part I greatly hope that you will give the fullest possible weight to the views of the&apos;Board of Trade.    I fully realise the difficulties of the position, but the political reactions here may be so unfortunate that I feel sure you will do everything in your power to help me.4. I have no observations to make on the line which you propose to take regarding the other Japanese proposals.5. With reference to your official telegram No.2754 of the 21st November, if in your judgment a tactful reference to the possibility of discrimination made privately by Bhore to Sawada would help, I have no objection to this being done.
