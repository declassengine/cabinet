;S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT),C R E  T. D*  304 (53.)..COPY NO.CABINET.DUTIES ON DUTCH VEGETABLES AND FLOWERS: DUTCH ORDERS FOR UNITED KINGDOM STEEL.Memorandum, by the President of the Board of Trade ,1. In the early part of the year His Majesty V:s Ministerat The Hague urged that advantage should be taken by us of the anti-German feeling caused in the Netherlands by the German restrictionson imports and the treatment of the Jews in Germany. Full tariff negotiations were not then practicable, but it was considered politic by informal contact with the Netherlands Government to provide an opportunity for an exchange of views on the understanding that the question of tariffs would not be discussed.2. A delegation comprising representatives of the coal and iron and steel industries, accompanied by representatives of the Department of Overseas Trade and by the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture, visited the Hague for an exchange of views with commercial interests in the NetherlandSo Our representatives asked the Netherlands Authorities to explore the possibility of influencing purchases in the United Kingdom of steel rails,  constructional steel and coal, particular reference being made to the steel which it was understood might be required in eonnection with the Dutch bridge-building programme.      A large proportion of the steel was expected to be of special quality (high tensile steel) and hitherto United Kingdom manufacturers had not succeeded in competing with Germany for similar business.    The representatives of the Netherlands also took the opportunity of indicating the hardships experienced by exporters of agricultural and horticultural products to the United Kingdom.
5. During the Economic and Monetary Conference, Dr.  Colijn,the Prime Minister of&quot;the Netherlands,  spoke to me ahout thepossibility of some understanding about sale and purchasearrangements aimed &quot;at increasing the trade between us.Dr.  Colijn referred,,  inter alia,   to the possibility that theNetherlands might buy in the United Kingdom some of the steelnecessary for its bridge building programme, and suggested thatreductions in our duties on flowers and vegetables would be welcomed by Holland.4. The discussions were continued by the parliamentary secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade and Dr. Hirschfeld, Director of the Netherlands Ministry of Commerce, and as a result the Ministry ,of Agriculture undertook to examine any proposals the Netherlands Government might make for variations of our duties on agricultural products that would be acceptable to them in this connection.      The Ministry of Agriculture made it clear however that any substantial concessions were impossible and that they could recommend no more than minor adjustments of the existing duties.5. The Dutch Government drew up a list of proposalsfor reduction of duties on certain varieties of fruit, vegetablesand plants and the Ministry of Agriculture have selected alimited number of items on which, in their view, reductions ofthe existing duties could be made either generally or for certainperiods of the year without serious damage to the interestsof home producers.      The proposals of the Netherlands Governmentand the suggestions of the Ministry of Agriculture are shownin Annexes I and II respectively,6. While these proposals were under examination thetime came for the Netherlands Government to place    an initial order for 5,000/6,000 tons of steel for a part of its bridge-building programme.      As a result of the conversations at The Hague, invitations to tender were  sent to United Kingdom firms but the quotations from Germany were lower than those from the United
Kingdom.      Before placing the order,  the Netherlands Government pressed for some answer from us regarding the suggestions relating to our duties.      They were informed that it was impossible to give any assurance regarding these easements at such short notice, but that a favourable decision on their part regarding the first order for steel would clearly improve the atmosphere.    In fact after reference to Dr. Colijn this order was placed in the United Kingdom at prices which it is understood exceeded those quoted by German makers, v. The duties now under consideration were  imposed on therecommendation of the Import Duties Advisory Committee and the Committee have been asked for their views as to the probable effect on the home industry of the changes in rates of duty suggested by the Ministry of Agriculture.        The Committee have replied that, in the circumstances, they have not seen their way to make enquiries of the interests concerned, and consequently are not in a position to express any opinion on the view of the Ministry of Agriculture that the concession will do no material damage to United Kingdom producers.      They point out, however, that they themselves when recommending the duties reported that it was not their intention to recommend any alteration in the general scheme of protection before the autumn of the year 1934.      Having regard to that statement,  the Committee do not feel able to give any support to the proposal. They add   that there appears to them to be a risk that even these comparatively small changes will tend to create in industry generally a feeling of uncertainty prejudicial to a continuance of that advance in production which has recently taken place. 8. It seems  to me that the Import Duties AdvisoryCommittee exaggerate the possible effects of these suggested alterations.      The proposals regarding cut flowers and plants
in flower are clearly of no real practical importance and the Ministry of Agriculture estimate that if the suggested reductions were made the duties on the cut flowers referred to in their Schedule would still he equivalent to some 20% ad valorem, and on cyclamen plants in flower to ahout-15% ad valorem.      The reduced duty on cauliflowers and broccoli would amount to about 10% ad valorem and would apply only during July and August when home production of these vegetables is negligible.      On the basis of imports equal to the imports in 1933 the loss of revenue resulting from the concession proposed on cauliflowers would be about  300 a year.      No figures are available for imports of the flowers and it is impossible to estimate what would be the effect on the volume of imports of the proposed reductions of duty. The reductions now proposed could be made by the Treasury by Order under Section 19 of the Import Duties Act. 9.        Although the present proposals are much more limited in scope than the suggestions made by the Netherlands Government and would probably be of little material impor-tance to their trade, that Government are aware of the lines on which such modifications would be made.      I understand that they attach great importance to our making some gesture of goodwill of this kind, however small, and that it would enable them to give greater consideration to our interests in connection with any other orders for steel that they may be able to influence.      Nothing in the nature of a formal agreement is in contemplation, but the Nether-lands Government have authorised us, if and when these changes are announced, to make the following statement:-&quot;We have recently obtained, through the goodwill of the Netherlands Government, an importantinitial order for United Kingdom steel for the
Dutch &quot;bridge &quot;building programme.      It is hoped that this will be the forerunner of other orders.&quot;10.      In the circumstances, I recommend that we. now make the reductions of duty scheduled in Annex II.      In my view this course can be defended by reference to the prospect of orders for steel from Holland.      The orders already obtained are of substantial importance.(Intld.)W. R.BOARD OP TRADE.15th December, 1933.
