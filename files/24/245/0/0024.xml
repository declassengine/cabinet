(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT&apos;... c R E T - Copy-No . - -C A B . I N E T ..303(33)SHOPS      BILL. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.29A promise was given in the King&apos;s Speech to submit legislation dealing with the hours of employment of young persons and other conditions in the distributive trades,  and a Bill is accordingly being drafted for this  purpose.The Bill - which is based on certain unanimous recommendations of the Select Committee on Shop Assistants, which reported in 1931 - will fall into two sections.      The first will deal with the hours of employment of all young persons  (14  - 18 years of age) employed in or about the business of a shop, (wholesale or ret3.il) and any warehouse connected with any such shop,  or employed in retail trade in any other premises.      These provisions, which will cover young persons employed in outdoor duties as well as indoor staff, will apply, it is estimated,  to something like 400,000 young persons.      The second section will contain provisions in regard to health and welfare conditions affecting all persons employed in these premises.There is nothing in the  second section with which I need trouble my colleagues at  this stage,  but as regards the first section there is a question on which I desire to obtain a decision of the Cabinet before final instructions are given to the draftsman .The proposals with regard to hours of employment have been the subject of prolonged discussion with representatives of the chief Trade Associations and in regard to most of them something approaching complete agreement has been reached.      In regard, however,  to the main proposal,  namely,   the fixing of a general weekly maximum of hours  (to replace an antiquated
provision in the Shops acts limiting the weekly hours of young persons to 74,  inclusive of meal times)  considerable controversy has arisen,  and it is  on this point that - with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Scotland - I desire to,.obtain the decision of the Cabinet. 140The Select Committee unanimously recommended a weekly limit of 48 hours exclusive of meal intervals,  but strong objection has been taken to this proposal by almost all the Trade Associations.     ,The negotiations  commenced with the National Chamber of Trade, which has branches throughout the country and includes numbers of small traders,  and at the outset the Chamber stated plainly that discussions would be of no use if the 48 hour limit was pressed.      They were not prepared to agree to less than 52 and this limit has been accepted by the Grocers&apos; Association and many other important Associations, though some bodies press for 54 hours or more.      The Home Office while making it clear that there was a strong feeling in Parliament in favour of 48 and that the matter would be subject to final decision by the Cabinet,   agreed to continue discussions on the basis  of 52,  and there will be  a considerable outcry, especially among the smaller shops,   if anything less than 52 is adopted.Fifty-two,  exclusive of meal hours,   represents,   of course,  a great advance  on the present maximum of 74 inclusive, which is equivalent to something like 67 exclusive.      It would also be a substantial advance on existing practice.     No average can be given for the whole of the trades concerned,  but the report of the Select Committee shows that in a number of tr?udes (e.g. bakers,  butchers,   confectioners,  fruiterers, grocers and tobacconists)  the average normal hours range from 54 to 56, while these or longer hours are worked in a number of individual shops in almost every trade.On the other hand,  the 48 hours limit,  besides having the support of the unanimous recommendation of the Select
Committee is strongly pressed for by the deputations received from Workers&apos;- Associations   (Trade Union Congress General Council; Shop Assistants Union:    Distributive and Allied Workers&apos;  Union) and also by the Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress;    and there is a strong feeling in favour of it in the House of Commons,  as shown in recent Debates.      Moreover,  in the Co-operative Societies&apos;   shops and large retail stores there are 48 hour agreements in operation for adults as well as juveniles. 14JFurther,  the Minister of Labour with whom the Secretary of State for Scotland and myself have discussed the  question,   is of opinion that the Government would be placed in a very difficult position if any higher., limit than 48 were fixed in the first Bill for the regulation of working hours since the controversy on the Hours Convention began (other than legislation for Coal Mines). The Government would then be open to the accusation that they were hostile to the 48 hour working week,  and that while they were discussing with Industry the possibility of still shorter hours in connection with the absorption of more workers into employment,  their considered policy was a week of 52 hours or more .      This argument would be strengthened by the fact that the present proposal refers only to juveniles.In the Memorandum I previously circulated (CP. 292(33)) I proposed to fix 52 hours as the normal weekly, maximum, but to enable Parliament by resolution to substitute 48 hours after a period of three years from the commencement of the Act.     I feel, however, that there is great force in the objections taken by the Minister of Labour, and on further consideration I propose - with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Scotland - that 48 hours should be fixed as the normal weekly limit,  but that in order to give the employers time to adjust themselves to the new conditions there should be a transitional period of two years from the commencement of the Act,  during which the limit should
-4-142be fixed at 52. This will, of course, by no means satisfy the retail traders, but it should soften the blow to a considerable extent .It is proposed to supplement the weekly hours with a limited amount of overtime to meet periods of pressure.      Over-time was contemplated by the Select Committee, but under their proposals, which applied to adults as well as young persons,  the overtime was to be fixed by national and local Advisory Boards, No such Boards will be set up under the Bill,  and it is therefore necessary to fix the amount of overtime in the Bill.      I propose to adhere to the proposals in my previous Memorandum,  namely, 24 hours while the weekly limit remains at 52, and 50 hours when the 48 hours limit comes into operation,  subject to conditions as to the maximum number of hours for which a young person may be employed overtime in any week,  and the number of weeks in which overtime may bo worked in the establishment.      The National Chamber of Trade and: others have asked for a somewhat higher allowance,  and this  is a point on which perhaps some concession might be made,   if necessary,   in the Standing Committee.I accordingly recommend that the hours of employment for young persons should be  fixed at a v/eekly maximum of 48 (with a yearly allowance of 50 hours overtime)  subject to a provision allowing a weekly maximum of 52 hours  (with 24 hours overtime)  for a period of two years from the commencement of the new Act.&apos;      J .G.14th December,  1933.
