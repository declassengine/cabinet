THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC. MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.&apos;S3CRET,Copy No.39,P. 890(33)CABINET.United Kingdom Coal Trade with Italy.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.Sir Ec Dxnimmond in his despatch of November 4th which was circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs /C.P,280(33X7 examines the recent course of coal imports into Italy.    He mentions a&quot;s an undoubted fact that South Wales coal is better suited than is German or Polish coal for the requirements of the Italian State Railways who are very large users of coal, whilst prices are generally speaking, quality for quality, in favour of Welsh coal.    It nevertheless appears that substantial orders have recently been placed for German and Polish coal and Sir E. Drummond gives reasons for thinking that Italian Government purchases of coal are likely in future to be directed to countries which are prepared to accord favours to Italy in the economic sphere.    As coal represents one of the largest items in Italy&apos;s import bill, naturally coal forms-one of her &quot;strongest bargaining counters&quot;.The view that Italy, in the absence of some further economic understanding, will reduce her purchases from us of coal for the State Railways is confirmed by reports which the Mines Department have received from persons who have recently \ visited Italy with a view to securing contracts for future suppliesr    Strong hints have in fact been given to such persons that they cannot expect to secure contracts until at
least some move is made in this country towards the initiation of commercial conversations with Italy.    Similarhints have &quot;been given to His I-iajesty - s Commercial____Counsellor in Rome, 74Apart from actual State purchases of coal for the Italian State Railways, substantial quantities of coal are required for public utility undertakings such as gas works, whose purchases the Government are in a position to control.    Moreover, there is always the possibility that the Italian Government may revive proposals which were at one time under consideration for controlling all purchases of coal for Italy in the hands of a national coal consortium.    If a scheme of this character were ever adopted the whole of our coal exports to Italy, and not merely those destined for the State railways and public &quot; utility undertakings, would be under State control and subject to State dictation.The export of coal to Italy is not only a matter of great importance to this country as a whole, accounting as it does for nearly one-half of the total value of our exports to that country, but it specially concerns South Vales.    South Wales is a district where employment is at present at a very low level and one which has   hardly benefited at all from the recent agreements concluded with Scandinavian oountries for larger purchases of British coal.    It is therefore, obviously important to oonsider whether by diplomatic means some steps can be taken to safeguard the future of thiB trade.It is nevertheless very doubtful whether we should do well to embark on general commercial negotiations with Italy.    Imports from Italy include a large proportion of manufactured goods, notably textiles, on which it would be very difficult to give any concessions in regard to
existing duties.    In particular, it-would obviously be impossible to tie our hands in regard to the duties on silk and artificial silk manufactures, which are under the review of the Import Duties Advisory Committee.   But if we were to offer to negotiate over the whole field, it is certain that Italian requests would be put forward in regard to these goods;    and a failure on our part to meet such requests might very well lead to far more strained economic relations than exist at present.Our exports to, and imports from Italy roughly balance at present.    If we can retain our existing share ofthe coal trade of that country we&quot;are likely to continue to do so.    It is moreover, by no means certain that Italy is looking for a comprehensive commercial agreement, which if it were to be concluded would tie her hands over a range of existing customs duties.    Certain Italian officials have in fact in private conversation with members of His Majesty*s Embassy expressed the view that such widespread negotiations v/ould be undesirable under the present unstable conditions of trade and currencies, a view which coincides with those put forward by the Italians during the recent World Economic Conference.Prom all points of view, therefore, it seems that the most helpful line to pursue is to attempt to arrive at a much more limited understanding which will take account of Italy&apos;s susceptibilities in regard to products of peculiar importance to herself.    In this connection the remark of Signor Asquini which Sir E. Drummond quotes in his despatch appears to me of special significance.    It will be recalled that in referring to the slump in the Carrara marble trade he asked &quot;How can you expect me to buy your coal when you go and impose heavy duties on our marble?&quot;.
The reference here v;ae, of course, not to the existing duties which are only 10 per cent, on marble in the rough and 15 per cent, on worked marble, but to the proposals which were put before the Import Duties Advisory Committee earlier this year on behalf of marble workers in this country for greatly increased duties.    These proposals called forth a diplomatic protest on the part of the Italian Government.    The report of the Import Duties Advisory Committee is now in the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government and whilst recommending a higher duty on fully worked marble, namely, one of 20 per cent, ad valorem, does not go as far as the applicants would have wished.In all the circumstances, I should propose to ask the Italian Ambassador to come and see me and endeavour to elicit from him some indication of the policy of the Italian Government in regard to coal imports.    I should propose to inform him that we have no wish to see any disturbance of the present trade relations which involve an approximate balance of trade between the two countries. If, however, the equilibrium should be upset owing to the diversion of coal orders from the United Kingdom to other markets we might find ourselves unable to maintain our purchases from Italy.    I should,  of course, abstain from using any language of a threatening character, but the Italian Government will no doubt be aware that there are certain Italian products whose importation we could greatly restrict by a general increase of duty if we so desired. About 80 per cent, of our imports of lemons, for example, are derived from Italy.    At present, lemons are dutiable at only 10 per cent, ad valorem.It is, however, in my view essential that I should bo in a position to promise something which could be represented as a concession, if assured that Italian
purchases of coal from this country will toe maintained.    It is no doubt possible that the Italian Ambassador may refer to tho question of the silk duties in this connection. Obviously, however, no undertaking could be given in regard to silkj    and it appears to me all the more important that I should have full authority to offer a substantial concession in regard to worked marble.I am informed that if full effect were given to the report of the Import Duties Advisory Committee, and that if, as a result, all the worked marble which we now import from abroad were replaced by unworked or partially worked marble and this were worked in this country the additional number of persons employed would be at most 1,200.    then such a figure as this is considered inrelation to the number of persons employed in producing the coal that we send to Italy (approximately 20,000), it -becomes obvious that the interests at stake in maintaining and possibly even expanding the coal trade far outweigh those of the stonecutters who might get some advantages from the adoption of the report of the Committee.I accordingly ask my colleagues for authority(l) to discuss the coal situation with the Italian Ambassador,    and(2) to offer to undertake that the existing duty on Italian worked marble shall not be increased, should it appear that such an offer would secure the maintenance at its present dimensions of our coal exports to Italy.W.R.Board of Trade.8th December, 1933.
