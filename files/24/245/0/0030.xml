FIRST REPORT.&apos;        . All/Science and finance.1. During recent months, we have devoted a considerable amount of time and thought to the question of improving the contacts which at present exist between the world of science and finance. In the years of speculative company flotation which preceded the depression that began in 1929, there were many instances of industrial venture, based on a scientific foundation which was intrinsically unsound or dubious, and known to be so by competent men in the particular- branch of science concerned, which, none the less, succeeded in attracting a large measure of financial support from the general public. Extreme cases can be quoted of instances which any sound scientific advice would have condemned at sight, and where the real interest behind the promotion was the sale of worthless patents or shares. But perhaps of even greater importance were the schemes that had been tested in the laboratory but had not received the necessary working out between the laboratory and the works scale, and schemes on which inside information existed that the process was too costly to prove remunerative. Such cases represent a legitimate field for enterprise by a private venturer who knows the risk which he is taking, but not for the promotion of companies in which subscriptions are invited from the public.2. We have given careful consideration to the question whether any steps could usefully be taken to check flotations of this character in future. The problem is not an easy one, since the more undesirable flotations are often undertaken by company promoters of an essentially irresponsible type, who are unwilling, at the sacrifice of their own pecuniary profit, to take pains to safeguard the public from exploitation. An increasing proportion of domestic issues are, however, handled by reputable issuing houses, with a name to preserve. The banks, moreover, are in a position to veto, or at least discourage, a flotation which they are convinced is undesirable, by declining to act as the company&apos;s bankers; and, in practice, the banks scrutinize new prospectuses submitted to them with considerable care, and reject a large number.3. We have, therefore, explored the possibility of doing more than is done at present to check, through the good offices of the issuing houses and the banks, company flotations which are based on unsound or dubious scientific claims. We are of opinion that considerable good might result if these institutions were to develop the habit of consulting freely, in cases of doubt, such bodies as the Royal Society, the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Medical Research Council and the Agricultural Research Council. Whereas industry has, in modern times, developed countless points of contact with science, scientific men still represent a strange and unfamiliar world to bankers and financiers. The latter do not know very clearly who are reliable authorities in any particular field of science and who are not, and they are not in a position, therefore, to rate the qualifications of the men who are put forward as experts. But frequent consultation with the Royal Society and the three Government Research Councils would, we believe, largely overcome this difficulty. By consulting the secretary of the appropriate body informally, a bank or issuing house could obtain useful information as to the standing of any scientist whose name was put forward in connection with a doubtful proposition, and could obtain ready and reliable advice as to the best scientific man to approach for an independent opinion. Consultation of this character is already by no means unknown, but we are of opinion that it could be largely developed with great advantage. We doubt if, at present, banks and other financial institutions sufficiently appreciate how useful to them would often be the information which the bodies we have mentioned are in a position to supply, and how readily it would be given.4. So far as the banks are concerned, while we do not suggest that it would be possible for them, in virtue of the very limited responsibility attaching to them as the bankers of a company, to assume the role of &apos;&apos; vetting&apos;&apos; the
scientific claims&apos; of prospectuses that are supported by reputable names, there are many other cases in which, we believe, they would find an independent scientific opinion of great value. It is true, of course, that the scientific aspect is only one of many aspects of any question which the banks and issuing houses have to consider. It is one thing for a project to be scientifically sound; it is quite another thing for it to be sound economically; and it is no part of our intention to suggest that an undue weight should be attached to the scientific merits of a proposition. But the question of its scientific merits is, none the less, of fundamental importance.5. There are many other ways in which the financial world might derive benefit from the development of the contacts we have indicated. It sometimes happens, for example, that a bank has to administer as trustee a bequest for the furtherance of science. Here the advice of the appropriate scientific body would be invaluable. Again, it may sometimes happen that the opinion of scientific men would have an important bearing on the wisdom of extending bank advances, not to a particular concern, but to an industry as a whole.6. We therefore suggest that the attention of the banks and the leading-issuing houses should be drawn to the advantages which they might derive from consultation with the Royal Society and the Government research organisations, though, before this is done, formal steps should be taken to ascertain that those bodies would be ready to co-operate in the manner suggested.7.   We accordingly recommend (a) that the Treasury should address letters on the lines indicated in (b)below to the Chairman of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers for communication to the joint stock banks, and to the Governor of the Bank of England for communication at his discretion to issuing houses;(b) that the letters referred to in (a) above should draw attention to thefact that in a number of cases prospectuses have been issued in recent years which contained claims for the scientific value of particular methods or substances which would not have been endorsed by first-class scientific authority, and should state that the Royal Society and the three Research Councils of the Government (the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Medical Research Council, and the Agricultural Research Council) would be willing, if asked to do so in any particular case, to suggest the names of scientists of the highest standing who could be invited by the banks (or issuing houses) to furnish them with reports on the scientific merits of the methods or substances for the development of which it might be proposed to make a public issue;(c) that consideration should be given by the Treasury to the questionwhether public attention might be called to the action taken by means of a friendly question and answer in the House of Commons.Signed on behalf of the Committee :A. DANIEL HALL,Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, December 9, 1933.o
