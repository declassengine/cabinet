COPY NO.    -Jt3CABINET. THE NEW CUNARD LINER. Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1.      On the 22nd March last in the debate on the Consolidated Fund Bill I stated our policy on this matter in the following sense.     Provided the preliminary conditions were fulfilled we would consider granting financial assistance to enable the ship to be completed.     But it was an essential preliminary that the North Atlantic fleets of the Cunard and the White Star should make satisfactory arrangements to end competition and we would do all we could to forward the negotiations proceeding to that end.2.      At the Cabinet meeting on Friday 18th July, I made a statement in some detail to my colleagues on the progress of this matter, and I think it may be convenient if I repeat the Cabinet record of what I then said.      It is as follows:-&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer brought up the question of the proposed continuation of the large Cunard liner in order that he might, consult his colleagues as to their willingness for him to continue negotiations during the Recess on certain lines.     Up to now the negotiations had been tedious, and agreement had not yet been reached between the Cunard and White Star Companies.      Some of the difficulties, however, had been eliminated.      The Cunard Company had now agreed that a new Company should be formed to operate the Atlantic trade.      The division of shares between the operating Companies had not yet been decided.      He was holding a meeting that very afternoon to try and reach an arrangement.      It was proposed that the share-holders should surrender certain shares and take instead shares in the new operating Company.
The question then arose as to what form the assistance by the - Government should take and what terms they shouldmake.     Before explaining this the Chancellor said that he did not propose that the Government should help towards the construction of a second ship, but only the ship already begun, on which  1,700,000 had already been spent and  2,800,000 remained, making  4,500,000 in all. Incidentally he mentioned that the corresponding French ship was to cost  9,000,000.      As to the prospect of the ship becoming a paying proposition, Lord Essendon, who had been rather an opponent of the policy of building these giant ships and still thought it better to build three medium-sized rather than two&apos;mammoth ships, con-sidered that the ship would pay and win a sufficient traffic from the Germans for this purpose.&quot;&quot;If he followed the ordinary course, any Government assistance would be a first charge on the property of the operating Company.      It was impossible, however, to insist on those terms,  owing to the conditions governing some categories of the shares in the parent Companies. Negotiations had not yet begun, but his own view was that the only plan was for the Government to accept the position under which a portion of the charges would be taken over in the form not of debentures but corresponding to the charges the two firms would have on the profits of the operating Company.:    that is to say, what he would call &quot;income debentures&quot; -- a somewhat vague term to which different meanings sometimes attached.      This meant that the Government would not have a prior charge on the assets or profits of the operating Company, but would stipulate for a prime charge of, say, 2%,  and for the rest would share with the ordinary shareholders.      The Company, of course, would like to fix the charge on the liner only, but he thought the Government would have to spread it over the whole of the operations of the Company.      He did not think they could get a mortgage over the whole assets of the Company, so he asked the Cabinet to allow him to negotiate
on.the terms he proposed.    In reply to the Prime Minister he made clear that the Government would have no responsi-Toility for the operation of the Company&quot;. 3, After a discussion which is recorded in the cabinet minutes    the Prime Minister thought    that the view of the Cabinet was that I should be allowed to go on with my negotiations during the Recess on the assumption that my proposals were ac-cepted in principle and that I should report the result of the negotiations to the Cabinet for consideration.      The Cabinet agreed in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.4. As my colleagues are aware the negotiations have beencomplicated by the need not only to reconcile the competing in-terests of the two Companies but also to make provision for the rights of the Cunard Debenture Holders and to reconcile the di-vergent interests of the secured-creditors of the Oceanic Company which owns the White Star fleet.      These latter are the Treasury and the Government of Northern Ireland as guarantors of Trade Facility loans secured upon the &quot;Britannic&quot; and the &quot;Georgic&quot; and the Oceanic First Debenture Holders who are secured in part upon the remaining North Atlantic vessels of the White Star and in part upon other assets of that Line not affected by the pro-posed merger.      About three-fifths of the Oceanic first debentures are held by Glyn Mills and Company as security for a loan;    the rest are Its Id by the public.5. Notwithstanding these conflicting interests matters haverecently advanced,  by reason of goodwill on all sides, to the following point  :-6. Heads of Agreement have been reached between Sir PercyBates as Chairman of the Cunard and Lord Essendon as Chairman of the Oceanic for the formation of a new merger Company to which tie North Atlantic assets of both Companies would be transferred and by which they would be operated.7* Proposals prepared under my direction for providing thenecessary finance for completion of No.  534 by the new merger Company have similarly been, agreed by Sir Percy Bates and Lord Essendon..      Each agreement is contingent upon the fulfilment of-3-
the other.8. The Government of Northern Ireland and Glyn Mills,and Company have agreed to fall in.9. The scheme therefore is ready to he brought tofruition subject to&apos; the following:-(a) Acceptance by the Cabinet (which has been expressly reserved in the negotiations),and subsequent ratification by Parliament of the financial provisions.(b) Acceptance by the ordinary debenture holders of the Oceanic and Cunard Companies, The respective spokesmen an-anticipate that this assent will certainly be given.10, Concerning the Heads of Agreement for the merger ofthe two North Atlantic Fleets, negotiated between the Chairmen of the two Companies,  I need only say firstly that it appears to me to be an adequate and effective instrument for the amalgamation which the Government are postulating,  secondly that as the assets will be transferred unencumbered to the new merger Company exclusively in consideration of shares,  the scheme involves the secured creditors of both Companies sub-stituting charges upon shares for their charges upon the exist-ing physical assets.      This was vital to the establishment of a strong elastic aadunencumbered organisation.      Mr. Pollock and Glyn Mills have already agreed to it.       It is in particular to this that the assent of the public debenture holders of the two Companies has to be secured.11. The proposed terms for the financing of&apos;534&apos;which of course from the Cunard point of view are an integral and essential part of the bargain are set out in detail in the Appendix.12. I make three observations upon them.
13.      By persuading the Cunard Company itself to assume a debenture obligation in favour of the Government for one-third of the necessary advances I have been able to reduce below my original anticipations the amount (now one-third only of the total) which the Government will advance for  construetionof the ship upon an income debenture instead of upon a more normal fixed debenture charge.14.      In the discussions it has become patently obvious that the new Company, if it is to take its proper position among the great competing international lines, must have an adequate credit backing.      For this reason it is proposed to take power to advance to the Company (upon the terms set out in the note) working- capital or credit backing to such amount as may be required, up to a maximum of  1,500,000.      This sum in fact closely corresponds to the amount of capital already expended by the Cunard upon the new ship.      It is not anticipated that the new Company will in fact require so large a sum for this purpose.      It is intended only to advance such&apos;sums as may be required from time to time and the maximum figure stated may I think be regarded as a signal to the world of the Company&apos; s power rather than as a sum which the Government may be called upon to lend.15,      It is proposed, to ask Parliament to authorise an advance upon suitable terms for the construction at a later date of a complementary ship (or ships) - which is not necessarily the same thing as a sister ship.     But it is proposed to retain for the Government an effective veto not only on the question of the time when, but on the question whether, that advance shall be made.
16*      I should perhaps add that all monies advanced would of course he advanced on capital account.17;,      There have already been references in the Press to &apos; the supposed completion of negotiations and assuming that my proposals commend themselves to the Cabinet I should propose to arrange for a Question to be asked in the House at once and to reply broadly in the following terms -&quot;I am glad to say that these difficult and complicated negotiations, conducted with great goodwill on all sides, have reached a stage at which the Government feel justified in assuming that an effective merger of the North Atlantic fleets of the Cunard and White Star lines will become an accomplished fact at an early date.    It is the intention of the Government in that event shortly to lay before the House proposals for furnishing the necessary finance for the completion of the new Cunard Liner known as No.  534.&quot;(Intd.)    N.O.Treasury Chambers,  S,W,1. 11th December, 1933o
APPENDIX.FINANCE OF &apos;554&apos;. &quot;Solution put forward by Treasury,  subject to:-(a) acceptance by the Government,(b) agreement from their several standpoints of the Cunard and Oceanic interests,(c) modification in detail when legal and accountancy advice on the construction of a scheme comes to be taken.The amount required to complete &apos;534&apos;  is taken at the round figure of  3,000,000.    It is assumed that no additional expense will fall on the new Company or the Government on account of the construction of the vessel having been delayed.1.      The   Government    to make three    advances for completion of the ship in the sequence stated -(a)  1,000,000 to the Cunard Company against second debentures of that Company;(b)  1,000,000 to the new merger Company against first debentures of that Company;(c)  1,000,000 to the new merger Company against income debentures of that Company.2.      The money to be advanced in suitable instalmentsfrom time to time as it is required to be spent.3.      Interest.    For the debentures -One half per cent below Bank rate varying until 1st January,  1940;    thereafter the rate of interest appropriate on that date to a Government guarantee loan.For the income debentures,  something on the following general lines -The income debentures will not receive any interest inany year except to the extent to which profits are availablefor distribution,  the same criteria being applied by the directors as in connection with a distribution to ordinary-7-
shareholders.    Subject to that, profits will he applied - f) Qfirst In paying 5% on the income debentures;next in paying the like percentage on the shares;the balance to be distributed pari passu to the income debentures and shares.&quot;It is not intended under this arrangement that if theIncome debentures received very large r ates of distribution,the whole should be applied as interest.    It might be providedthat if as the arrangement worked out it gave the Government anaverage of more than, 3% per annum up to 1st January,  1940,  and5% per annum thereafter,  the excess over this limit,  instead ofbeing paid as interest on the income debentures,  should beapplied to redeeming income debentures at their face value.    an illustration of the intention is attached.4*      Duration of Advance.    The debentures to be long debentures, e.g. repayable in 1975, with an option to the Company to repay earlier.    The income debenture except so far as previously redeemed in the manner set out in 3. above might be repayable at the same date.. 45.      Security.    The service of the Cunard loan would be an obligation of the Cunard Company.    The security might probably follow the lines of the security for the first debentures (as it may be adjusted in connection with this scheme), but would be a second security.The Service of the debenture loan to the new merger Company would be an obligation of that Company secured by an ordinary first debenture.    The specific security might be &apos;534&apos;  and in the course of time when &apos; 534&apos;  loses its value the replacing ship or ships.Against the possibility of liquidation the income debentures might have a second charge on &apos;534* and for the rest rank pari passu with the ordinary shareholders.
no 6.     Under the foregoing arrangement, the Ounard Company would in substance bring into the new merger Company not only  &apos;534&apos; with  1,700,000 expended thereon but also  1,000,000 ready to spend on it and would arrange with Lord Essendon a proportionately enlarged interest in the share capital of the new Company.7o      Working capital (or credit backing).    The Government v/ill advance to the new merger Company from time to time such money as may be needed for working capital, subject to a maximum of  1,500,000, one half on the security of a separate issue of income debentures which might have a participation in profits similar to that of preference shares, and one half on the security of a debenture corresponding to the debenture for the advance of  1,000,000.8.      Complementary Ship (or ships).     The legislation to include a provision empowering the Treasury, if and when they see fit, to advance to the merger Company the cost of such ship not exceeding  5,000,000 on terms analogous to those for &apos;534&apos;.
