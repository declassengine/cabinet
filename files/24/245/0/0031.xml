(THIS DOCUMENT IS 1THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIT ANN IG MAJESTY&apos; S GO VERMONT ) .COPY NO.   ^4SECRETCP. 510  (53).CABINETINDIAAppreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India, dated 19th December, 1935.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated 19th December, 1933, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for Incia.During the last month there has been little change in the situation.     Civil disobedience activities are still negligible;    in October there were only 242 convictions for offences connected with the movement and, in November, probably an even smaller&apos; number.     The number of persons undergoing imprisonment shows a further decline of over 500 during the month.Congress politics are still in a state of confusion v/hich has centred recently round the question whether a meeting of the All-India Congress Committee should be held to review the existing policy.     Mr. Nariman who takes the lead in advocating the abandonment of civil disobedience so as to free Congress from its unlawful status and consequent paralysis, has gained appreciable support for his views, but Mr. Gandhi and Pandit Jawaharial Nehru have remained opposed to what they would regard as a confession of failure.As a consequence, an informal conference of the chief members of the Working&apos; Committee which was held recently at Jubbulpore reached no decision and a renewal of conversations some days later at Delhi seems to have left the situation unchanged.    Meantime, however, a new factor has been introduced by a Government statement in the Legislative Assembly in reply to a question as to their attitude towards a meeting of the All-India Congress Committee.     It was explained that the Government see no reason for differentiating between the All-India Congress Committee and other Congress bodies.     This Committee has not, it is true, been proscribed as unlawful, but that is only an accident owing to the fact that in recent years the Committee has made no effort to meet or function
1 i:   2. :in any way.The general policy of the Government in regard to such meetings was indicate a in the third appreciation for 1933, that, as long as Congress stands pledged to civil disobedience, no meetings can he allowed.     Government have also made it clear that they cannot accept the view that it is only by holding a meeting of the All-India, Congress Committee that the policy of Congress can be changed. What prevents that section of Congress which favours complete abandonment of the movement from making their opinion effective is not the question whether a particular meeting can or cannot be held but the fact, that the leaders who dominate Congress policy are still opposed to any change. There is no doubt that any departure from the consistent policy that the Government have maintained towards meeting of any Congress body would give rise to considerable uncertainty in the country and suspicions that government attitude was weakening..Mr. Gandhi has refrained from any public statement on political matters and has devoted himself to social movements He has new embarked on an All-India tour, the programme of which covers some eight or nine months, the declared object being the prosecution of the movement for the uplift of the Depressed Classes.     The tour commenced in the Central Provinces and the Local Government give the following appreciation of its result in that province.&quot;His presence has caused very large crowds to assemble a portion of which consisted of sight-seers.     There is no-doubt that a feeling of veneration for Mr. Gandhi personally is very strong., particularly among the masses.    At the same time his influence as a political leader appears to be on the decline.     Opposition to temple entry and similar reforms
is very strong amongst the Orthodox, and, although this opposition has not made much apparent headway in Mr.Gandhi&apos;; s presence, after his departure the movement will probably gain strength.It is responsible for the alienation of the sympathies of a portion at least of the moneyed classes among Mr.-Gandhi&apos;s supporters, and to this may be attributed the fact that the sums collected during the course of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s tour, though in themselves substantial and amounting-probably to over Rs.60,000, are said not to have come up to expectation. Much depends on the ultimate destination of the money collected.     Three fourths of this is proposed to be left behind in the localities where it is collected and if this occurs ana money is then spent for the betterment of the depressed classes it will no doubt increase Mr. Gandhifs influence.     On the whole, however, it is probable that the effects of the tour are likely to be ephemeral.&quot;A similar appreciation is given regarding his visit to Delhi, which is said not to have evoked as much enthusiasm as it did on the last occasion that he visited this city. That he still has considerable influence is indicated by the extent of the audience which attended, his public reception, which is said to be about 20,000.Pandit Nehru made a very militant speech recently in Delhi reiterating his view that the obstacles in the way of progress are foreign Government, the Indian Princes who are supported by it, and the moneyed classes. His audience comprised a large number of students and it is to youth that he will appeal in support of his extremist views. It does not seem that he has yet made up his mind as to his precise course of action nor has he put forward any definite
programme, but there are serious potentialities of danger in his activities.J.n the Madras Presidency there have been signs of growing agitation recently for the grant of further relief in Land revenue in consequence of prevailing economic conditions.     Hitherto agitation has been on constitutional lines and it is anticipated that orders, which will shortly be announced by the Madras Government, will satisfy Raiyots and moderate opinion, but it is possible that Congress extremists may attempt to stir up a campaign for the refusal of payment of revenue by contending that the relief is inadequate..     Mr. Gandhi&apos;s tour will shortly bring him to the district principally affected, but it is doubtful whether he will lend himself to any such agitation.
