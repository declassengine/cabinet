fHIa DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;a GOVERNMENT ,CRET. COPY NO.      l&apos;*&apos;P. 298 (53).1 / -aCABINET. Report of the Chamber of shipping bpeclnl Committeepn Tramp Shipping.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The reports In the Press of 8th December would give the impression thyt His Majesty&apos;s Government has received the unanimous or practically unanimous recommendations of the British shipping industry as to the policy to be pursued in respect of tramp shipping.      I deoire briefly to remove any misapprehensions that may exist under this head.The two chief general Associations of Ghipowners in this country are (l ) the Chamber of  hipping of the United Kingdom, an Association of owners representing 13 million tons gross of shipping of all classes, and (2) the Liverpool Steam bhip Owners&apos; Association, representing owners of 4f million tons gross of shipping, mainly of the passenger and cargo liner class.I received from the Chamber of Chipping on the 8th December: 1.    the report of the Tramp Committee; 2e    copy of a resolution passed by the Council of the Chamber j39    a covering letter Y/hich sets outs(a) that the Council of the Chamber did not feel it their duty or the right of the Chamber to judge whether In fact the Tramp Section of the British Mercantile Marine had reached the edge of disaster,  or whether, as the Tramp Committee suggests, a temporary f.nib sidy would cave them.     The Council think that this decision muat rest with His Majesty&apos;c
Government,     The report of the Tramp Committee was, therefore, received and considered hy the Council, hut not submitted to vote. jgg(b) that the resolution was considered by aiiub-Committee of the ohipowners&apos; Parliamentary Committee, who had not reached agreement on it0The resolution referred to in (by is a very mild document compared with the Tramp Committee1s report.     I should explain that the Ghipowners&apos; Parliamentary Committee is a joint body representing the Chamber of shipping and the Liverpool iJteam 3hip Owners&apos; Association.It is clear that the Council of the Chamber of Shipping has not faced up to the question of considering the Tramp Committee&apos;s recommendations from the point of view of the shipping industry as a whole, but ha..- merely passed the Tramp Committee&apos;s report on.I albo received on the 8th December a copy of a report by the Liverpool Steam Ghip Owners&apos; Association from which it it clear that they are not in agreement with the recommendations of the   Tramp Committee.I shall probably have at a later date to bring the question of the Britir-h Mercantile Marine before the Cabinet, but my object at the   moment is to remove any misapprehension as to the attitude of the Associations of the shipping industry generally to the various recommendations in the Tramp Committee&apos;s report which have appeared in the Press.W.R.Board of Trade.11th December, 1933.
