Printed for. the Cabinet.. December 1933.Copy No.     41CABINET.THE USE OF TEAR GAS BY THE POLICE FORCE IN PALESTINE:Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues a copy of a despatch from the High Commissioner for Palestine in which he recommends that on humanitarian grounds the use of tear gas by the Police Force in Palestine should be reconsidered.In view of the possibility of further disturbances occurring on the 16th January next, Sir Arthur Wauchope asks for an early decision by telegraph.2. After the disturbances of 1929 Sir John Chancellor, then High Commis-sioner for Palestine, raised the question of the use of non-lethal gas, and was informed that, under existing pledges and as the result of public pronouncements. His Majesty&apos;s Government were precluded from openly countenancing the use of gas for either military or civil purposes. Reference was made to previous decisions of the Cabinet in the case of Southern Rhodesia and India.3. The question of the use of tear gas has been under the consideration of the Cabinet on several occasions : (a) In 1926 the Government of Southern Rhodesia enquired if the use of gas in native rebellions would be permissible. After consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence it was agreed that the Governor of Southern Rhodesia should be informed privately that His Majesty&apos;s Government were anxiously considering the whole problem of chemical warfare, but that, having regard to existing pledges on the subject, the time had not yet come when they could openly countenance the use of gas in native rebellions.(b) On the 21st January, 1927, the Cabinet approved a recommendation of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee that authority should be given for gas to be used in China against the mob, subject to the issue of very definite instructions as to the circumstances under which it might be employed, with the proviso that gas was not to be employed without express authority from home (C.I.D. Paper 764-B).  No use was, in fact, made of this authority.(c) In 1928 the Secretary of State for War (Sir Laming Worthington-Evans) circulated a memorandum proposing the use of tear gas by British troops for the dispersal of large hostile gatherings in Egypt.This memorandum set out the obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government under the various international instruments dealing with the prohibition of gas warfare, viz., The Hague Convention, Article V of the Second Washington Treaty of 1922, and the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925, and made it clear that no undertaking had yet been given by any country to abstain from the employment of chemical methods in civil war or disturbances.With this paper was circulated a memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal (Lord Salisbury), in which the line was taken that it was impossible to maintain the &apos; position that lachrymatory gas might properly be used in the case of civil disturbances but not in the case of war.The Cabinet were inclined to the view that the moment was inopportune for opening the question in any form, although it was a matter which might well be taken up by the Government in office after the next General Election.[9404]   [9411]SECRET. CP. 301 (33).
(d) In May, 1930, the Secretary of State for India (Mr. Wedgwood Benn), who was being pressed in Parliament with questions as to the use of tear gas for the dispersal of mobs, informed the Cabinet that he proposed to reply to the effect that the matter had been considered, and that the Government declined to make use of this weapon. The Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for India should, if possible, arrange that the proposed questions should not be put but, if the questioners insisted, should reply as proposed in his memo-randum.  The question was put and was answered in the form approved.(e) In June, 1933 (CP. 161 (33)), the present Secretary of State for India irecommended that the Government of the Punjab should be authorised to make experimental use of tear gas for police purposes in situations such as arise when armed criminals are brought to bay in a house or place of refuge. The Cabinet decided (42 (33)) that there was no objection to the experimental use of tear gas for police purposes in India on the limited lines suggested in the memorandum by the; Secretary of State for India.4. It will be seen that the High Commissioner for Palestine draws particular attention to the value of tear gas for the purpose of avoiding casualties in dispersing illegal assemblies and riotous crowds in the tortuous and narrow streets of the old quarters of the towns, where, if firearms are used, the prevalence of ricochets leads to a disproportionate loss of life.I am much impressed by this argument and by the five points in favour of the use of tear gas which are emphasised in the 1928 memorandum of the Secretary of State for War, viz. : (1) Gas is temporary in effect and therefore humane; it leaves no victim tobecome a martyr and subject for propaganda. (2) Gas is particularly effective as it reaches every member of a crowd,whereas the lethal weapon is individual in. effect and may hurt theinnocent and spare the guilty. (3) It is economical and can be used effectively by the Police, thereby lesseningthe chances of having to call in the military. (4) It can be used at an earlier stage of a riot than can the lethal weapon, andlessens the burden of responsibility placed on officers in command. (5) The efficacy of its use depends in but a small degree on the numbers ofPolice or troops available.5. I do not consider that these advantages are outweighed by any of the objections which have been raised from time to time to the proposal under discussion :  (i) As regards our international obligations, I do not think that our adherence to the Washington Convention and the Geneva Gas Protocol can reason-ably be held to debar us from the use of non-lethal gas for the suppression of civil disturbances, and I infer from the decision reached in 42 (33) in the case of the Government of the Punjab, that this view is now accepted by the Cabinet.(ii) Mr. Wedgwood Benn, as Secretary of State for India in 1930, mentioned certain other objections : (a) The successful use of tear gas depends upon favourable wind conditions; the control of it is difficult, and it might, and probably would, penetrate into houses and among people who had nothing whatever to do with the disturbances; women and children would probably be among its victims.I am prepared to leave it to the Police authorities in Palestine to use their judgment as to the practicability in any particular case of using tear gas, and to arrange for due warning to be given to the inhabitants of the area concerned. When firearms are used it is impossible to ensure that people who have nothing to do with the disturbance are killed or wounded; tear gas neither kills nor causes permanent injury.(&amp;) Under unfavourable conditions tear gas might be quite ineffective, and resort might have to be had in addition to rifle fire.This is quite possible, but it does not in my opinion minimize in any way the advantage of using tear gas in suitable conditions and as a preliminary measure of control.
(c) The manufacture &quot;of tear gas for use against mobs might easily lead to counter methods by revolutionaries.I doubt whether evilly disposed persons in Palestine could more easily obtain materials for the manufacture of tear gas than-arms and ammunition and bombs. In any case, the Police would have greater facilities for obtaining protective equipment.6. I feel sure that my colleagues will share my anxiety to give Sir Arthur Wauchope all possible assistance in dealing with the difficult situation with which he is faced, and I trust that they will agree with me that his present proposal affords good prospects of controlling civil disturbances in Palestine with little or no loss of life, and should be approved on this ground.(Initialled) P.

APPENDIX.(Confidential.)(Reference No. CF/282/33.) High Commissioner for Palestine,Sir, Jerusalem, November 1933.I HAVE the honour to refer to Sir John Chancellor&apos;s despatch, Confidential A, of the 16th April, 1930, on the subject of the use of lachrymatory-gas in police work in Palestine.2. I realise that under existing pledges and as a result of public announce-ments, His Majesty&apos;s Government are precluded from using lethal gas for either military or civil purposes, but I am not aware whether the prohibition extends to the use of a non-lethal gas, such as tear gas, which leaves no permanent ill-effects nor physical disability.I consider that tear gas would be a most valuable agent in the hands of the Police Force in Palestine in dispersing illegal assembles and riotous crowds, particularly in the tortuous and narrow streets of the old quarters of the towns, where if firearms are used the prevalence of ricochets leads to a disproportionate loss of life. If its use had been permitted during the clashes which took place recently between Arab demonstrators and the Police in Jaffa, Haifa, Nablus and Jerusalem, it is probable that the Police would have been able to break up the crowds without the use of firearms and that no lives would have been lost.Of the casualties, all 26 deaths of civilians and 73 of the wounds were caused by bullets. In Jerusalem if not all, at any rate nearly all, the 7 deaths and 25 wounds were caused by ten shots fired by two policemen.3. The Commissioner of Police for South Africa has recently informed Mr. Spicer that tear gas has been used with excellent results in South Africa. It is also, I believe, successfully employed by American and European Police Forces. On humanitarian grounds I recommend that its use in Palestine - should be reconsidered.I have, &amp;c.ARTHUR WAUCHOPE, High Commissioner for Palestine.P.S. In view of the possibility of further disturbances occurring on the 16th of January next, when the Arab Executive have announced their intention of organising a general strike and demonstrations throughout Palestine, I shall be glad if you will inform me by telegraph whether you are prepared to accept the recommendation which I have made in this despatch, and if so, whether tear gas bombs or containers can be made available before that date.A. W.The Right Hon. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, G.B.E., M.P., etc., His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.o
