Copy No.    43CP. 299 (33).CABINET.- 127THE DISARMAMENT POSITION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs.IN considering CP. 294 (33) on &quot; The Disarmament Position,&quot; it may be useful to my colleagues to have before them in convenient form the most important telegrams that have recently been, exchanged with His Majesty&apos;s representatives in Paris, Berlin and Rome on this question. I would particularly call their attention to telegrams Nos. 116 and 117 from Mr. Campbell.J. S.December 12, 1933.7131a   [9393]15

Phipps (Berlin).(No. 238.   Very Confidential.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, December 7, 1933.MY telegram No. 230 and your telegrams Nos. 97, 98 and 99, Saving, and Nos. 269, 274 and 275.You should seek the earliest opportunity for seeing the Chancellor again, informing him that you are now in a position to tell him that His Majesty&apos;s Government have given careful consideration to his proposals and desire to convey to him their preliminary impressions.These proposals have two aspects, one concerned with the limitation of &quot; armaments and the other with the wider field of political appeasement.   I will deal first with the second of these aspects, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government attach the utmost importance.His Majesty&apos;s Government entirely agree with what would seem to be the Chancellors view, namely, that the achievement of a disarmament agreement would be immensely facilitated if it were accompanied by political assurances calculated to improve and consolidate good relations between Germany and her neighbours. The question then arises how this can best be achieved ? We should be, interested to have further details as regard precise terms and form of the non-aggression pacts which the Chancellor has in view. Needless to say, members of the League cannot enter into any such arrangement as would be inconsistent with their obligations under, the Covenant. The list of countries with whom Germany would negotiate such pacts, as given in your telegram, does not include all the limitrophe States.   We presume, however, that these would be included.Turning to the part of the Chancellors proposals which is concerned with technical questions of armed strength, we would first make two observations.Our final conclusions as to various items and figures could naturally only be reached as the result of completing the consultations between different Powers in which Germany herself is taking part. Secondly-, world opinion will compare these proposals with those contained in the Draft Convention to which Germany, in common with other Powers, gave her adherence in principle, on its first reading.In the light of the above reflections, you should point out that the proposed increase from 200,000 to so large a total as 300,000 will certainly be considered excessive, while the suggestions in respect of guns and aircraft also look very formidable. We should like it to be quite clear that the S.A. and S.S. would be absorbed in the new army and would not continue to exist as supplementary organisations. Again, while we assume that the Reichswehr will disappear as such, it would be helpful if the Chancellor would confirm this. His Majesty&apos;s Government are glad to note that the Chancellors proposals would include general supervision, but it would tend to clearness if it were made plain that this super-vision is of the kind usually described as periodic and automatic. Other Governments may, of course, have other observations to make or elucidations to request, and our own observations are not intended to be exhaustive.
His Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly desire to use the present opportunity to hammer out without delay, in co-operation with Germany and other States, a practical basis for agreement for limitation of world armaments, freely entered into by all parties. The enquiries they have addressed through you to the Chancellor will, they hope, be found helpful in the pursuit of this common task.(Repeated to Paris, No. 232; Rome, No. 401; and Washington, No. 508.)Sir John Simon to Sir E. Phipps [Berlin).(No. 239.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, December 7, 1933.IF you find that Chancellor is disposed to treat communication in my imme-diately preceding telegram as unduly critical and discouraging, you should say that we feel that by mentioning plainly and at once some of the difficulties we foresee, not as barren objections but as constructive suggestions, the speediest road to general agreement may be discovered.No. 3.Sir John Simon to Sir E. Phipps (Berlin).(No. 242.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, December 7, 1933.FOR your own guidance, I would explain that the present position as regards &quot;security&quot; is as follows: The fear and suspicions aroused by some of the manifestations of the Hitler regime last summer made it inevitable that France should be more concerned than ever about security. As His Majesty&apos;s Government could not undertake further commitments themselves, France pressed for an indirect measure of &quot; security,&quot; which in the suggestions of 14th October took the form of dividing the process of disarmament into two periods. As this scheme has been rejected by Germany, the question now is whether Hitler is able and willing to offer any adequate alternative in its place. It stands to reason that the need for additional measures of security has been now further increased by Germany&apos;s threat to withdraw from the League, since this has had the immediate effect of lessening the value of Germany&apos;s obligation to use the machinery provided for in the Covenant for the maintenance of peace.No. 4.Sir E. Phipps to Sir John Simon. (Received December 8.)(No. 282.)(Telegraphic.)   R. Berlin, December 8, 1933.YOUR telegram No. 238.I have just seen Chancellor and made him desired communication in the presence of Baron von Neurath.1. Chancellor assured me he would be ready to conclude non-aggression pacts with all limitrophe States, but he has specially in view France, Italy, Poland Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and England. He seemed to attach importance to the last named.2. Chancellor pointed out that the discrepancy between the number 300,000 and 200,000 in British draft convention is explained by the fact that, whilst that convention reduced numbers of effectives and armaments of other Powers, he suggested leaving those Powers with their present effectives and armament, and this for very god reason, that he realises that neither France nor Poland, only to mention them, can or will disarm.[9393] b 2
3. He assured me that the S.A. and S.S. might be compared to the Salvation Army. (Here I regret to say I laughed.) They were purely political organisations. He admitted, however, that 1,000 S.S. and 600 S.A. were armed and used as a special guard for the Government. He had recently disbanded 6,000 police. Still he would be ready that automatic and periodic general supervision, to which he agreed, should see these bodies are not military. I suggested that general ruling might be drawn up governing such bodies every-where (see my telegram No. 276), and Chancellor agreed.4. Reichswehr would, the Chancellor said, disappear and be transformed into short-term army within three or four years. Baron von Neurath said it was strange that His Majesty&apos;s Government should now ask for periodic and automatic supervision, but I said that it was presumably to avoid friction, as would be caused by the special summoning of supervisory commission at the request of a foreign Power. Moreover, Chancellor&apos;s proposals were new and demanded new conditions from us.Chancellor begged me to let him have roughly in writing gist of our remarks, so I am forwarding them to Baron von Neurath unofficially, enclosed in a private letter.   He will reply in writing in due course.(Repeated to Paris, Rome and Washington.)No. 5.Sir E. Phipps to Sir John Simon. (Received December 11.) (No. 109. &quot;Saving.)(Telegraphic.)   En clair. Berlin, December 9, 1933.THE Chancellor seemed less strained and more normal than usual when he received me yesterday. He wore on this occasion one of those brown shirts of which I was attempting to deprive him.On this point only, viz., when I suggested the absorption of the S.A. and S.S. (roughly 2 millions) into an army of 200,000, did he give vent to any outburst. It was here that, betraying a lamentable lack of humour, he compared these bodies to the Salvation Army, and shouted out that they were in no sense military; but that if foreigners insisted on considering them as such he would make them so.The Fiihrer&apos;s loss of composure in this matter is not surprising, nor need it be taken too tragically. We were in effect seeking to place him in the uncom-comfortable position of a &quot;guillotine par persuasion.&quot; The S.A. and S.S. are indispensable to Herr Hitler for internal political reasons. To dissolve them (for that is what our suggestion amounts to) at the behest of foreign Powers would be absolutely fatal to the Hitler regime, which would, indeed, collapse. Moreover, from the point of view of internal order in Germany, the removal of the discipline imposed even spasmodically on some 2 millions of the inhabitants would have very unfortunate consequences.I think, therefore, that a solution of this question must be sought on other lines, and here the spontaneous suggestion of Herr Hitler himself that those bodies should be subject to the automatic and periodic supervision to which he agrees seems distinctly helpful. We should, moreover, be able to draw up stringent regulations in regard to them on the lines indicated in my telegram No. 276 of 6th December. This will ensure that the S.A. and the S.S., like the Salvation Army, will abstain from field exercises with dummy machine-guns, &amp;c. .I have, of course, informed my French, Italian and American colleagues of the result of my yesterday&apos;s interview with the Chancellor.M. Francois-Poncet rather plaintively remarked that the Franco-German tete-a-tete so far had resulted in everybody except France conversing with Germany. He had in mind my two interviews this week with Herr Hitler, and Signor Suvich&apos;s approaching visit, to which he looks forward without any pleasure.M. Francois-Poncet applied on 7th December for an interview with the Chancellor, who replied that owing to his absence from Berlin for the week-end and to Signor Suvich&apos;s visit he would not be able to receive his Excellency until .14th December.(Copy by bag to Rome.)
5129No. 7.Mr. R. H. Campbell to Sir John Simon.-^-(Received December 9.) (No. 116.)(Telegraphic.) Paris, December 8, 1933,AS it would have been impossible to see Minister for Foreign Affairs (debate involving existence of the Government is in full swing), I saw Secretary-General of Ministry for Foreign Affairs this evening and made to him the communication as instructed. I also gave him substance of your interview with French Ambassador this morning (your telegram No. 236).21 : M. L6ger, after listening attentively, described to me the nature and import of instructions sent to French Ambassador at Berlin. M. Poncet had been told that instructions would be sent to him as soon as Government had got over financial stile (i.e., if they survived) and had had time to consider the matter, in the Cabinet. In the meantime, lest continuous silence of French Government were to lead to misconceptions, M. Paul-Boncour, with the approval of President of the. Council, had directed French Ambassador to take an opportunity of informing the Chancellor that conversations already taking place obliged French Government to formulate.two reserves, namely, that France could not discuss any solution of disarmament problem based on Germany&apos;s rearmament or any arrangement relating to the Saar based on suppression of plebiscite.[9393] . b 3Sir John Simon to Mr. R. H. Campbell (Paris).(No. 237.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, December 8, 1933.:-. MY despatch No. 1888.You should urgently suggest to the French Government that they should&quot; . support the enquiries which Sir E. Phipps has been instructed in my telegram-No. 238 to Berlin to make to the Chancellor, and you should urge the French Government to use the opportunity thus created to elicit from the Chancellor more precisely the German attitude on both the political guarantees and the technical question. You should point out that His Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly desire to use the present opportunity to hammer out without delay, in co-operation with Germany and other States, a practical basis for agreement for-limitation of world armaments freely entered into by all parties.You should point out to the French Government that we particularly wish to know their views of Herr Hitler&apos;s suggestion for direct Franco-German settlement of the Saar question. (If the Saar be excluded ab initio from negotiation, as suggested in Berlin telegram No. 280 giving M. Francois PoncetV instructions, it seems that prospect of successful issue will at least be impaired.) Might not such a settlement prepare the way for a reaffirmation by Hitler of all Germany&apos;s obligations under the Locarno treaties to respect the French and Belgian frontier and a stronger undertaking of non-aggression with all limitrophe countries 1 The French Government are no doubt considering the value in present circumstances of obtaining Hitler&apos;s signature to undertakings given by previous-German Governments;The ball has been set rolling by His Majesty&apos;s Government, but it is essential that the French Government should keep in step with them by exploration oh their own account. You should emphasise the fact that a French conversation with Germany should not imply less intimacy with Great Britain, any more than the initiative of His Majesty&apos;s Government implies less intimacy with France. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider it of the first importance that the two&apos; Governments should be in step. The only thing that seems impossible is that they should both stand still. It is only by harmonious movement that it can be-discovered whether a basis is even now attainable for a general agreement On disarmament and security in which all can take part:His Majesty&apos;s Government will of course keep the French Government informed of any developments from this reply to the German overture, and naturally hope that the French Government will with- reciprocal frankness keep them informed of the course of any conversations that they in turn may have in this matter.
3. When I here developed argument contained in paragraph 2 of your telegram, M. Leger maintained that it was quite impossible for a contracting party to ride roughshod over provisions of a treaty to which not only numerous other Powers were parties, but which guaranteed certain rights to Saarlanders themselves, though admittedly they would never vote for absorption into France and might by date fixed for plebiscite (many things might happen between now and then) prefer continuance of present regime to reabsorption into Germany. French Government could and would discuss economic and industrial matters, but only on the understanding that plebiscite were not interfered with. In point of fact French Government had not understood from M. Poncefs conversation with Chancellor that latter put an immediate settlement of Saar question in the foreground, but rather that he considered it as a matter which, constituting as it does the only territorial question between France and Germany, it would be well, incidentally, to embrace in any general arrangement. I said, however, that it looked as though Herr Hitler did in fact attach great importance to an early settlement. M. Leger replied that neither that nor any other consideration would induce French Government to be a party to what would in effect be an illegal act.4. As to German obligations under Locarno, these would not be worth much if they were only to be recognised as price of new agreement involving German rearmament. In point of fact Chancellor had spontaneously assured M. Poncet that he fully abided by them. I pointed out that that was not the same thing as a - public reaffirmation backed by new spirit in Germany, but my arguments produced no impression.5. I need not repeat all arguments mainly of familiar type used by Secretary-General in the course of conversation lasting over two hours. It is clear that M. Boncour and President of Council have made up their minds (and they will doubtless be upheld by their colleagues) that in no circumstances will they put signatures to any settlement involving German rearmament, and will not, so far as they are concerned, continue discussions on that basis. If Herr Hitler will continue on no other, they will wait until General Commission meets and results of bilateral conversations are reported. They will then make public declaration of concessions which they remain prepared to make as their contribution to a settlement based on gradual disarmament to present German level. If that meets with no response they will take their stand on the treaties and on article 8 of the Covenant and claim that they have not the right, even if they had the wish, to set aside their obligations and subscribe voluntarily to German rearmament. If others are willing to do so, let them take the responsibility openly before the world.6. I did all I could to persuade M. Leger that this attitude ignored realities of the present hour. It was obvious that it could lead to no agreement. What would France do then? He replied a new situation would have arisen, that France, after taking stock of her friends, would meet it as best she could. I tried to persuade him that a large body of opinion, at least in the British Empire, America and Italy, would not sympathise with French attitude. He retorted that, be that as it might, no French Government could be a willing party to a Disarmament Conference ending in rearmament. Fie was unmoved by any arguments, based on the security which might ensue for France from measures of political appeasement adumbrated by the Chancellor. What, he asked,! did these amount to? If Herr Hitler were really sincere, why did he not propose a lesser measure of German rearmament accompanied by a measure of French disarmament? (He put this question, I think, merely as an argument: it should not be taken as implying that French Government would accept any, such arrangement.) Offer to France to maintain her existing armaments looked suspiciously like bait with which to lure her into hasty agreement which she would have reason later to regret.7. When I said that after all we none of us yet knew exactly what; the Chancellor&apos;s proposals amounted to, and that you were anxious that Russia should walk in step with you in bringing them into the light of day and thus possibly reducing them, he said French Government would fully appreciate this, but that it was quite impossible for [group omitted] to adopt this course without implying that they were ready to talk on basis at least of some measure of German rearmament. As this was not the case, it was more honest in their position to make the reserves which French Ambassador in Berlin had been instructed to
7i 30formulate. Nor was it necessary for the purpose in view that French Govern-ment should join exploratory process. Desired knowledge would be obtained by enquiries made by other Governments engaged in conversations at Berlin.8. I told M. Leger that, as decision which his remarks implied was so grave a one, I felt that I ought to have it from the lips of M. Paul-Boncour himself. He said he quite agreed, that he. himself would prefer it, and that he would arrange an interview as early as possible. When it takes place, possibly to-morrow morning, I will again go over the whole ground and develop all the arguments contained in your telegram, but I am under no illusion that the result will be any different.  It is clear that the decision has been taken.(Repeated to Berlin and Rome.)No. 8.Mr. R. H. Campbell to Sir John Simon. (Received December 10.) (No. 117.)(Telegraphic.) Paris, December 9, 1933.I SAW Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon and went with M. Leger. Whilst making it plain that you had no thought of endeavouring to influence French Government to adopt any course which they felt to be contrary to their interest, I developed all your points in favour in following out exploratory process to its logical conclusion. I put them in the form of considerations which 1 presumed the French Government had not ignored when instructing the French Ambassador at Berlin to formulate their two reserves.2. M. Paul-Boncour was quite inflexible. He repeated over and over again that France had gone to the utmost limit [ ? omitted : and] that any Government which engaged [ 1 in] conversations on basis of German rearmament would be swept away, and that it had, therefore, been necessary in order to avoid subsequent misunderstanding to make the two reserves, which need not, however, necessarily put at end to Franco-German discussion.3. When I suggested these reserves, if maintained, would destroy prospect of any agreement freely entered into by parties concerned, which seemed only way of obtaining a lasting settlement, he said he did not agree that that was necessarily so. Owing to Germany&apos;s abrupt withdrawal from the conference offer whereby she would have attained complete equality of rights within a relatively short space of time had never been squarely put to her; certainly it was unknown to German people. He would like to see it put in this way : Germany had herself asked to be allowed to transform her professional army into a short-service army; she had said that process would take three or four years; it would be unreasonble for him to ask that before process was complete and there was similarity of armies there should be similarity of arms; similarity of arms until highly trained Reichswehr had disappeared would give Germany before long her superiority; equalisation of all [group undecypherable] process of equalisation of arms would have begun or equalisation of armies was complete.4. When I asked M. Paul-Boncour whether he saw any alternative to the other three eventualities enumerated by Mr. Baldwin, he said that he did; it was that, in the event of Germans&apos; insistence on rearmament rendering any agree-ment impossible, recourse should be had to machinery of the League of Nations, which the French Government intended to uphold by every means in their power: French public was clamouring for application of article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles. He admitted this would be a severe test for the League of Nations in present circumstances, but thought it might be well to end by revivifying it.5. Whilst freely admitting that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not bound by September negotiations, M. Paul-Boncour deeply regretted that they had thought it necessary to depart from an agreement which they considered at the time to be a fair offer and which was inspired by principle of no rearmament which they had so constantly put in forefront of their public declarations. Experience shows that this change of mind would indeed encourage Herr Hitler to increase his pretensions. His own information was that Herr Hitler&apos;s position despite appearances was none too strong and that if he thought he could get away with it he would go on seeking to consolidate it by fresh triumphs in the field of external relations.   The one thing that would restrain him was fear of isolation.
6. M. Paul-Boncour finally expressed his grave concern at what would happen if Disarmament Conference ended in a substantial measure Of German rearmament. He thought that a great outburst of indignation leading perhaps even to. popular risings would sweep over the face of Europe. I again made it plain to him that His Majesty&apos;s Government, so far as they were concerned, had not taken up any definite position. They were still in exploratory stage, which it would be difficult to carry through to completion if the French Government did not keep in step with them.7. I asked M. Paul-Boncour whether, as an entirely reciprocal idea, I might suggest his instructing the French Ambassador at Berlin when formulating reserves (he has not yet done this) to add for their part French Government did not regard them as closing the door to continuance of Franco-German conver-sations. (This is perhaps a shade less discouraging than formulation of reserves without qualification.) He replied, in order to keep in line as long as possible with His Majesty&apos;s Government, he would be glad to do this. He subsequently, however, asked that His Majesty&apos;s Government, as a counter-part, should take an opportunity of informing Herr Hitler that they still adhere to principle of no rearmament. I said that I could not ask you to do that; my suggestion had been a purely personal one and I would rather withdraw it than that he should accept it subject to condition. He said, in that case he would withdraw the condition and act on my suggestion.(Repeated to Berlin and Rome.)No. 9Sir John Simon to Sir E. Drummond (Rome). (No. 403.) V(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, December 7, 1933.MY telegram No. 238 to Berlin.Please inform Signor Mussolini in strict confidence of substance of my instructions to Sir E. Phipps, and say that I shall keep him informed of any answer we may receive from German Chancellor. I am sure that he will keep us similarly informed of any conversations Italian Government may have with Germans.(Repeated to Berlin, No. 234, and Paris, No. 241.)No. 10.Sir E. Drummond to Sir John Simon. (Received December 9.) (No. 374.)(Telegraphic.) Rome, December 8, 1933.YOUR telegram No. 403.I saw Mussolini this evening and communicated to him substance of your telegram No. 238 to Sir E. Phipps. I find that the Italian Ambassador at Berlin had informed his Government fully and correctly of points set out in Berlin telegram No. 274.Signor Mussolini was more doubtful whether Germany would be prepared to conclude pacts of non-aggression with some of her smaller neighbours, and in particular with Austria. He considered Locarno gave France all the security she could properly desire.He was very critical of French policy and League of Nations. He said that the time for a preventive war had now passed, and therefore France ought to do everything possible to secure at once an armaments convention which Germany would accept. Germany was becoming stronger every day, and her demands would increase as her strength grew. She was still suffering from internal and economic difficulties, and was therefore still more or less reasonable; but delay was very dangerous, particularly for France.On technical side, he feared that S.S. and S.A. would not disappear. They might be demilitarised, but would remain as athletic societies and thus be available as trained man-poAver.  But France, with Poland, and Czechoslovakia, were much
stronger than Germany, both in man-power and in war material. He believed to-day Poland alone would have a great initial advantage in a war with Germany.He reverted to his idea for arrangements for disarmament convention as set out in my telegram No. 320.He promised to inform me at once of any news he had from the German side.Full report of conversation by to-morrow&apos;s bag.(Repeated to Paris and Berlin.)No. 11.Sir E. Drummond, to Sir John Simon. (Received December 9.) (No. 375.)(Telegraphic.) Rome, December 9, 1933.MY telegram No. 374.My concise impression of interview is that Signor Mussolini thinks that the present German terms should be accepted as soon as possible lest a worse thing befall.(Repeated to Paris and Berlin.)No. 12.Sir E. Drummond to Sir John Simon. (Received December 10.) (No. 377a.)(Telegraphic.) Rome, December 9, 1933.I COMMUNICATED to Signor Suvich this evening substance of Sir E. Phipps&apos;s telegram No. 282.As regards first paragraph, Signor Suvich remarked that Italy was not a Germany, and he hoped that she never would be one. Argument in favour of 300,000 as opposed to 200,000 men was strong, but former figure was excessive. He enquired whether armed police had been taken into consideration and whether any period was suggested for duration of convention.I was not able to answer either question, but suggested that, as the Chancellor had spoken of a great peace for ten years, perhaps he had in mind a ten-year convention. Signor Suvich was considerably impressed at observation made. I thought it well, however, to draw his attention to Echo de Paris statement, which contains substance of instructions given to French Ambassador in Berlin.Signor Suvich, while sympathising up to a point with French distrust of Germany, said that logical consequence would have been, a preventive war when Nazis assumed power. France for various reasons had not taken that course. Therefore she should now secure the best arrangement possible, including supervision. If it were ultimately shown that Germany was violating her engagements France would have a strong case; but to sit still and do nothing meant uncontrolled German rearmament.(Repeated to Berlin and Paris.)
