(THIS DOCUiviO-T IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.CP.312(35)CABIN B TrROAD ACCIDENTS.KE1DRANDUK BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT.1.     The high rate of road acciaents has for some time been causing me great concern ana of recent months public opinion has been clamouring for steps to be taken to reduce it.      I have refrained hitherto from submitting any proposals to the Cabinet in order that I might await the results of the exhaustive record end analysis of fatal road accidents, which was undertaken from January 1st of this year.     The results of the first six months of 1933 heve nov; been tabulated and published (a copy of the return is annexed to this memorandum) and, although the returnsfor the last six months may throw some further light on the problem, they are not likely to upset the main conclusions arrived at, nor will their importance justify any further delay in coming to a decision.The returns clearly show that there is no single cause to which accidents can be exclusively or indeed predominantly attributed, and it follows therefore that there can be no single remedy.     The problem can only he satisfactorily solved by various bodies, the Government, the police, the courts, the highway authorities and the road users themselves co-operating on converging lines.     Some of the proposals will involve leglisation and it Is on these in particular that I seek the approval of the Cabinet;   many can be carried out by regulation within existing powers, or can only he aealt with by appeal for voluntary co-operation, but even so I have included them in tuis memorandum in order that the Cabinet may have the complete picture before theau.
2. REGULATION OF ROAD USERS.Of the 2,963 fetal accidents during the first six monthsof the year analysed in the returns, only JO were attributed todefects in the vehicle itself, and 237 to the condition of theroad,     As these records rest upon the observations of polioeconstables it is possible that some cases due to mechanical defectshave not been noted as such, but even so it is clear that the human element is by far the biggest cause of road accidents and itis to deal with that aspect whether on the part of the motorist,the pedestrian or the other road users that I make the following proposals.A.   Speed Limit.The figures in Table XIII of the Accident Return would in themselves suggest that In cases where an estimate of speed could be given a considerable majority of the motor vehicles Involved were proceeding at not more than 20 miles an hour, but these figures must be heavily discounted.      It is always difficult for the police to obtain reliable evidence as the driver is unlikely to overestimate his speed and the injured person may have been killed or dazed by the accident.     Some better control of speed is, in my opinion, essential if any improvement in the present situation is to be secured, but I am not in favour of a general reimposition of the speed limit.     Apart from the difficulty of fixing what that speed should be, and Indeed of fixing any speed which would be at once reasonable and safe, experience has shown that the enforcement of a general speed limit for private cars and motor cycles is impracticable, while on the open road it is unnecessary.     After . much consideration I have come to the conclusion that the sounder course will be to reimpose a speed for these vehicles in built-up areas only.     Of the l,58l pedestrians killed, 1,218 were killed in built-up areas.     There will be some difference of opinion as to what that speed should be, but I propose 30 miles an hour.
In order that the motorist may know exactly where this speed limit is in force without the necessity of more signs and notices, I propose that a &quot;built-up area shall &quot;be defined as one where a system of street lighting is provided.This proposal will necessitate legislation.     I should at the same time propose to simplify somewhat the existing schedule in respect of those vehicles which are already subject to speed limits. Bo    Speed Indicators.Various proposals have been maae for imposing restrictions upon speed &quot;by &quot;governing&quot; apparatus which would automatically restrict speed beyond a certain level, or &quot;by speedo-meters easily legible while the vehicle is in motion to persons standing on the footway.     Such proposals I regard as fantastic, but I am investigating the possibility of obtaining efficient speedometers which would record upon a daily chart the speeds attained by a vehicle throughout the twenty-four hours.     There may be a case for requiring at any rate new commercial vehicles subject to speed limits to carry such meters If at some future date a satisfactory instrument can be produced at a reasonable price.I propose to require that commercial vehicles should carry a plate with a distinctive colour indicating the speed limit to which they are subject.     This would assist the police and other users of the roads in checking abuse and might also have a chastening influence upon the driver himself.     This can be done under existing powers. C.    Sounding of horns.There is a great deal of unnecessary sounding of horns, and strong public opinion exists in favour of doing something to abate this nuisance.    I should like to try the experiment of prohibiting the sounding of horns over an extensive area during
certain hours of the night and, as a suitable field for experiment, would propose all streets in the Metropolitan Police Area where publio lighting is provided.     The sounding of horns might be prohibited in the first place between 12 midnight and J,0 a.m.   A regulation prohibiting the sounding of horns is in force in Paris, Helsingfors and probably some other Continental cities, and thera is reason to think that the additional caution which such a restriction imposes on motor drivers has led to a diminution in accidents as well as in noiso.Hy existing powers do not enable me to make a regulation of this kind applicable to a specified area and therefore someextension of those powers by legislation will be necessary. D*    Tests for Drivers.The returns shew that the number of persons involved in fatal accidents who. have held a driving licences for less than six months was only 156 but many people probably hold licencesubstantial period during which they drive too occasionally to become expert, while it is impossible to establish any direc.t relationship between the accident rate and inexperience in driving. While a test for drivers will not eliminate the reckless driver, who may be and often is both skilled and experienced, It weuld, I think   do tmch to raise the general standard &apos;jf knowledge,including knowledge of the Highway Code.     I therefore propose as followsc-(l)   Drivers of publio service (passenger&quot;)vehicles aro tested, if the Traffic Commissioners think necessary, undor existing powers as a conaition of their licence.    .A11 new drivers to be tested..(2)   Drivers of heavy goods vehicles (over 2^ tons) to bo made subject to special licence and similar tests by the Traffic Commissioners.(3)   Drivers of other mechanically-propelled vehicles whoapply for a driving licence for the first time to be mado subject to a prescribed, testj    the test to be applied by and a certificate obtained from authorised organisations such as the Automobile Association and the Royal Automobile Club on payment of a prescribed fee.     These organisations already test their members
for the purpose of supplying certificates for persons who wish to drive abroad at a cost of 10/-, and I should hope to he able to make some similar arrangement.The examination would have to include a test of ability to handle a motor vehicle with reasonable skill and promptitude, some elementary knowledge of the mechanism of vehicles, and a knowledge of the Highway Code.     I do not think that we could apply medical tests or still less, psychological tests of quickness of reaction, but any examination should eliminate a certain number of persons who are unfit on physical or other grounds.It would also he useful to empower the Courts torequire any person now holding a driving licence who may beconvicted of careless or dangerous driving to be prohibited from driving again, even after his period of suspension isfulfilled, except on production of a certificate of the kindindicated above.These proposals would require legislation. E.    Penalties for Careless and Dangerous Driving.For reasons which it is difficult to appreciate, Magistrates are reluctant to impose the penalties provided by the Act of 1950 for careless and dangerous driving, and to suspend licences upon conviction.     The Home Secretary has addressed a Circular to Magistrates on this subject and the replies may assist us to get these particular offences viewed In a rather different light.At the present time a licence can only be suspended on the third conviction for careless driving.     I propose that a short period of suspension, say one week, should be permissible even for a first offence.
There are difficulties in the way of requiring all persons charged with careless or dangerous driving to attend personally in Court, even in cases where actual injury has been caused by a vehicle of which they are in charge, but it is essential to do something to make these offences more seriously regarded and I-propose in any case that all convictions for them, and also for exceeding a speed limit,  should be required to be endorsed on the licences.      These proposals would require   legislation. F*      Regulation of Pedestrians.:In the first place, I have decided to carry out a test of the system of &quot;passages clouteo&quot;, in force in Paris and other Continental Cities, and I am awaiting the advice of the London Traffic Advisory Committee as to the methods whereby such an experiment can best be tried.     As my powers to make regulations in this matter are limited to the London Traffic Area, legislation would be necessary to extend the power to cover other parts of the country.     It would be necessary to take powers to prosecute pedestrians who cross other than by the recognised crossing places where such are provided.      Such powers would only be brought into force after&apos; the experimental period has proved the merits of the system. G.   Propaganda and Education.I propose to revise the Highway Code, strengthen its terms and distribute it widely free of charge, not only to motorists, but through various channels, including the schools. It is important that this document should get into the hands of pedestrians and cyclists.     I am already required by the Act to place the Code on sale at a price of not more than Id.I am also convinced that an intensive campaign of propaganda must he undertaken before the commencement of the motoring season at Easter.     The Road Traffic Act, 1930,
(Section 115) expressly authorises &quot;expenses incurred in disseminating knowledge or otherwise informing the minds of the people with a view to promoting safety on the roads11 to he treated as a charge upon the Road Fund.      No such expenditure has been incurred in the last three years, and I feel that the time has come when this power should be used.I propose to avail myself of the existing organisation of the National Safety First Association in so far as that can usefully be done, and to make them a special donation (not to be continued in future years) to enable them to intensify their activities in connection with road accidents between now and the end of next summer.      I do not propose to incur expenditure by paying for space in the press, a course which I agree with the Treasury is undesirable and probably unnecessary, hut I should hope to secure the good will of the press for publicity in support of the campaign.     I should rely considerably on broadcasting, which need involve very little or no expenditure, and also to make use of the film.      Under this head it may be necessary to incur some expenditure but it need not be substantial.I am also considering the use of posters as a means of bringing home to all users of the roads the need for greater caution.      I understand from persons well experienced in advertising that posters which would be read-by the motorist, the pedestrian and the cyclist while they are actually in the street or on.the road, would be a most effective -means cf driving home the maxims of conduct wuich it is necessary to inculcate. I am in correspondence with the Treasury as to the expenditure to be incurred on these measures.5. R0A1T f ORTHIHE SS8   OF   VEHICLES.A. Of the 70 fatal accidents recorded in the first six months of the year, 24 were attributed to defective brakes or steering, 18 to burst tyres, and the balance to other defects of a varied character.      An inspection of public passenger
conveyances is already in force and these vehicles accounted for only two out of the 70 cases.     As regards motor vans and lorries, a system of spot examinations will be brought into force when the Poad and Rail Traffic Act is made operative and though, in order to economise staff, no inspection of any large proportion of these vehicles will be attempted, the knowledge that a small staff of inspectors is at work should have a salutary effect.Ac regards private motor vehicles and motor cycles I have no power to make any special inspection.     The police are, however, able to note those cases in which accidents actually occur and I propose to arrange, if possible, for reports to he made to my Department upon which it may be possible to come to some conclusion as to whether powers should be sought for carrying oat periodical tests of brakes, etc.     Meanwhile, I do not propose any extension of the powers of my examiners in this respect.B. In certain instances design is tending in directionswhich do not conduce to oafetjr, e.g. reduced visibility from the driver&apos;s seat in some sports cars and commercial vehicles. I have, as a first step, invited the attention of the Society of Totor Manufacturers and Traders Limited to this and certain other- matters.Peda11 Cyclists.     A requirement previously in force that pedal cycles should carry rear lamps was abandoned in X9iil in face of great parliamentary opposition, and they are now merely required to carry red reflectors.      Most motorists would be in favour of compelling cyclists to carry lamps.    Cyclists, on the other hand, object to such compulsion.      They argue (l) that drivers of following vehicles would rely upon a cyclist&apos;s lamp and that if it went out the cyclist would be left without defence or excuse,  (2) that if a cyclist were run down at night his lamp would be extinguished and it would be impossible
to disprove a statement that it was not lighted at the time of the accident, and (3) that the cyclist would he put to additional expense if he were obliged to carry a lamp.The figures available for the first six months de not throw any very clear light on the problem and are certainly not striking enough to support a proposal which has so recently been rejected by Parliament.     This is one of the cases where I prop jse to await the figures for the full- year before making any recommendation.     Meanwhile, in addition to the more vigorous enforcement of the provision with regard to the use of reflectors which comply with a proper standard of optical efficiency, I propose that power should betaken to prohibit the sale, as well as the use, of inefficient reflectors.      I also propose that rear mudguards -should be painted white.4.&apos;     ROAD CONSTRUCT I OF AND I&apos;&quot;AI NTENANCE IN RELATION TO SAFETY. A. While the number of fatal accidents definitelyattributable to the conditions of the road bed is comparatively low, there can be no doubt that a good deal could be done to increase safety by improvements in the layout, surfacing and li hting of- roads.The provision of footwa3rs along country roads,  the super-elevation of bends in open country, the reduction of excessive camber in village streets, the opening out of corners, are apt to be expensive matters, and however willing the highway authorities may be to co-operate, their ability to do so is dependent on tne availability of Road Fund grants.But if local authorities are forced to devote a larger part of their expenditure to purposes of this kind, they will, while the present limitations on Road Fund expenditure continue, be driven to   -cut down expenditure in other&apos; directions, which in turns night have a bad effect upon the efficiency and safety of the highway&apos; system.     For that
reason I do not propose any abrupt and drastic change of practice, but it may be possible to go further than has beendone in the past in pressing for improvements of the kind which I have instanced as a normal part of the activities of highway authorities.      In particular, I should propose to make the provision of an approved non-skid surface a condition of grant. Special arrangements would have to be made to deal with block-granted areas.B. Experiments might be tried in the following directions with the aid of the most favour-able rate of grant possibles -(a) the division of wide carriageways either by a continuous barrier or by islands so as physically to separate up and down traffic,(b) the division of a 30 feet carriageway into threetraffic lanes by white lines5    the centre lane would only be used by overtaking vehicles 1(c) experimental separate tracks for cyclists on certain stretches of road radiating from large suburban areas, e.g. the road through Epping Forest.C. Narrow, dangerous and hump-backed bridges, often hampered by awkward approaches, are a source of danger.      The Ministry has for some years past offered 73 per cent, grants towards the reconstruction or improvement of these bridges where they are in the ownership not of the highway authority itself but of a statutory authority such as a railway or canal company, but progress has been slow, and some further move should be made. Certain action I have taken in connexion with section 30 of the Road and Rail Traffic Act will, 1 hope, result in greater energy on the part of highway authorities, and I intend to discuss with the Treasury the allocation of the Road Fund for next year.      rihere the bridge belongs to the highway authority itself an intimation might be made that in the absence of improvement the road on which the bridge lies ean no longer be regarded as eligible for Road Fund grant, though here again the difficulty of the block-granted areas arises.      It would be
reasonable to agree the same rate of grant where the bridge is already vested, in the highway authority itself as in other cases.     The number of weak bridges dealt with, has diminished as followss-Year ending ilarch 1929    .......,...    408It	II	It	19f50           ......   .....	588tl	it	II		830II	II	11		522It	II	11		194In towns, subways for pedestrians might be encouraged at suitable points, although they are costly. D.   Warning Signs and Light Signals.A Departmental Committee has recently reported on the whole subject of direction posts and warning signs and regulations have just been made and are being promulgated, with the object of ensuring uniformity in these matters throughout the country and the adoption of standard signs of approved cqlour and design.      This should tend to make driving easier and safer.Light signals are being widely adopted in London and large cities and I am anxious to foster their rapid development. I have under consideration the possibility of giving light signals to pedestrians themselves, and certain other improvements in existing systems.B. I propose to address a circular letter to all highway authorities drawing their attention to all the points in which it is considered that action might be taken with a view to increasing the safety of the roads. 5.    Third Party Insurance.I hope shortly to circulate a memorandum dealing with certain proposals for amending the existing law dealing with compulsory insurance.

Net88-29PRELIMINARY REPORT ON FATAL ROAD ACCIDENTSwhich occurred during the six months ended30th JUNE, 1933Crown Copyright Reserved
Preliminary Report on Fatal Road Accidents! which occurred during the six months ended 30th June, 1933.The accompanying Tables with regard to the fatal accidents which occurred on roads during the period January 1st to June 30th, 1933, are based on information supplied by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, the Commissioner of Police of the City of London and Chief Constables throughout Great Britain.The object with which the inquiry was instituted was to obtain in a form suitable for tabulation by mechanical means a detailed analysis of the principal circumstances in which fatal accidents occur on roads.The form of the report on which this information was supplied by the Chief Officers of Police was determined after consultation with a large number of representative organisations which are particularly interested in this subject, and with the Home Office, the Scottish Office and representatives of the police forces in Great Britain.Chief Constables were invited, where possible, to indicate what,, in their opinion, were the causes which contributed to the accident. Where there were several contributory causes of which one was considered to be mainly responsible for the accident, Chief Con-stables were asked to show that cause as the main cause.Normally these reports were sent in after the inquest had been held and after any proceedings that might be taken as a result of the accident had been completed so that Chief Constables might be in possession of as much information as possible and be in a better position to give their own opinion as to the causes of the accident.The Minister wishes to express his thanks to the police forces of the country for their co-operation and for the time and trouble which they have spent in the preparation of the reports.The figures given in the Tables are the results of an analysis of the accidents occurring in the first six months of the present year. This analysis is of a preliminary character, and it may be that examination of the other items will show that hitherto un-suspected factors have a definite bearing om the causation of accidents.21299
NOTES ON THE TABLES.Table I.Total number of Fatal Accidents and Persons Killed.Accidents which occurred on or before the 30th June and resulted in the deaths of persons after that date have been regarded as fatal accidents occurring in the period under review. Similarly, where a death occurred on or after the 1st January, 1933, as the result of an accident before that date, the accident has not been included. This will account for discrepancies between the figures in these returns and other published figures.The total number of fatal accidents, as recorded in the Home Office Returns, which occurred on roads in Great Britain, during the first six months of 1931 and 1932 were as follows : -    January-June, 1931 ............      2,825January-June, 1932 ............      2,969The total number of persons killed in these accidents is not avail-able, as the Home Office Returns do not give the totals of persons killed month by month. The total number of persons killed in road accidents in Great Britain during the years 1930-1932 was as follows : Number of Fatal Accidents which occurred at each Hour of the Day.The percentage of accidents occurring during each of the hours specified in the first column is given in the last column. During the early morning hours when there is little traffic on the roads the percentage is naturally small. It rises to a small peak between 7 and 9 a.m., drops between 9 and 10 a.m., and then increases, rising to a further peak between 12 noon and 1 p.m. It then declines but rises again after 3 p.m. and reaches its highest point between 5 and 6 p.m. It then gradually decreases but reaches a further marked peak between 10 and 11 p.m.These figures will be further analysed, but as was to be expected the number of accidents at the different hours of the day has a tendency to follow the fluctuations in the total volume of traffic both pedestrian and vehicular. There are peaks at the time when many people go to their work (7-9 a.m.), during the luncheon hours (12 noon to 2 p.m.) and at the hour when a large number of people return from work (5-6 p.m.). Fatigue after the day&apos;s work may also have a bearing on the high figure for accidents during the hour 5-6 p.m.   A further peak occurs between 10 and 11 p.m.,1930 1931 19327,305 6,691 6,667Table II.
Thiswhen many people are returning home from amusements, is  the fourth most fatal  hour of  the  twenty-four.    It  may well be found on further analysis that these peaks&apos; are accentuated&apos; for week days and that the peak hours for Saturdays and Sundays are different.TABLE III.Number of Fatal Accidents which occurred on each Day of the.Week.The figures in the last&apos; column show the average number of accidents per day on each day of the week. Those for Bank Holidays, including Good Friday, are shown separately and are the highest in the list, averaging 26 per day. The next highest is the figure for Saturdays 20&quot;8. The lowest figure is that for Sundays-13&quot;2. There is a great decrease in (the use of goods vehicles and regular passenger traffic, public and private, on Sundays as compared with o&apos;ther days in the week, although there is an extensive use of pleasure vehicles on that day. On Saturdays, when apart from Bank Holidays most accidents occur, there is probably the greatest volume of traffic on the road.TABLE IV.Number of Fatal Accidents which occurred in each Month.The figures in the last column show the average number of accidents per day for each of the first six months of the year. February shows a decline, otherwise the figures increase month by month.In considering these figures it has to be remembered that a certain number of motor vehicles are laid up during the first quarter of the year.TABLE V.Comparison of Number of Fatal Accidents which occurred in Built-up Areas and in Areas which are not Built-up.62 per cent, of the total numfoel&apos; of accidents occurred in built-up areas.TABLES VI (A) AND VI (B). , Classification of Persons Killed.Of the 3,025 persons killed with whom the returns deal, 1,581 were pedestrians, and of the remaining 1,444, 514 were motor cyclists and 520 pedal cyclists.The following table shows the percentage of persons&apos;of different classes killed in road accidents in England and Wales during the period under review compared with the corresponding per-centages given by the National &quot; Safety First &quot; Association as the21299a 3
1932. 1933.Persons   driving    or    carried   onmechanically propelled vehicles  ...      33&apos;4 29&apos;7Pedal cyclists............      169 17-7Horse users    ...      ...      ...      ...        1-1 0-9Pedestrians     ..........:.      48-6 51-773 persons met their death in Great Britain while riding pillion.The figures relating to pedestrians are further analysed in subsequent tables.TABLE VII. Age, Sex, and Condition of Pedestrians Killed.The figures in the final column of the first two statements show the average number of pedestrians killed per 100,000 in the age groups shown in the first column.The figures for children under the age of 5 years, most of whom would normally be in charge of some older person, are less than those for the age group between 5 and 10 years, the period during which children learn to go about without immediate supervision but lack experience. Experience and education then &apos; lead to a decrease, and liability to fatal accidents reaches its lowest point among males between 20 and 30 years and among females between 20 and 40 years. Thereafter the figures show an increase for each decade, which is particularly marked in the age groups 60-70 and subsequent age groups, especially among males. This increase is no doubt partly attributable to a decline in alertness and physical power, but it may also be partly due to the fact that the older members of the community were not, during their more impres-skmable years, accustomed to present-day conditions on roads.The differences in the figures for males and for females-are noticeable, those for females being substantially lower in each age group than those for males. During the period covered by most of the age groups male pedestrians probably make a greater use of the roads than females.Table VIII.Circumstances in which Pedestrians were Killed.The figures given in this table do not deal with the question of responsibility for the accidents to which they relate. Of the total of 1,581 pedestrians killed, 857 were crossing roads, and of these 224 were passing behind or in front of stationary vehicles. The number of pedestrians who were not crossing the road and who were killed while running into the roadway was 314.   A furtherresult of their investigation into fatal accidents which oocurra during the last six months of 1932.July-Dec,   Jan.-June,
antlysis of the figures will, no doubt, show that a considerable number of these were children.46 pedestrians were killed upon footpaths and one on a refuge.84 pedestrians were killed while walking along roads. Of these 52 were killed on roads where a footpath was available and 32 where no footpath was available.Of the pedestrians killed while walking on the carriageway 66 were walking in the same direction as the traffic and 18 against the direction of traffic. The Highway Code recommends pedes-trians, where no footpath is available, to walk on the right of the carriageway so as to face oncoming traffic.Table IX.Types of Vehicles and Sex and Experience of Drivers (including pedal cyclists) involved in Accidents.Out of the total of 4,041 drivers involved in fatal accidents 156 were inexperienced (i.e., licensed less than 6 months) and 58 were inexperienced with the type of vehicle which they were driving at the time of the accident. In the absence of information as to the total number of inexperienced drivers on the roads in the period under review it is difficult to draw definite conclusions from these figures. It is, however, noticeable that the figures relating to motor cyclists form an unduly high proportion of the total.Table X.Ages of Drivers (including Pedal Cyclists).It is difficult to draw definite conclusions from these figures because the total number of drivers in each group is not ascertain-able. The number of pedal cyclists under 18 years of age involved in fatal accidents is, however, very noticeable. 42 pedal cyclists over 60 years of age were involved in fatal accidents.The figure for motor cyclists between the ages of 21 and 26 is high compared with that for motor cyclists in other age groups, but possibly a large proportion of motor cyclists are between these two ages. Similar considerations apply to drivers of public convey-ances in the age group 31-41.Table XI.Condition of Drivers of Vehicles (including Pedal Cyclists) involved in Fatal Accidents. It is noticeable that in very few accidents are the . drivers of motor vehicles stated to have been fatigued. On the other hand it is probably very difficult for the police to estimate the degree of fatigue of the driver who, even if he has not been injured, is likely to be in an abnormal condition after being involved in a fatal accident.2129!) A *
Without information as to the proportion of drivers of vehicles and pedal cyclists who are blind in one eye or deaf it is difficult to draw definite conclusions from the figures relating to these infirmities. The number of pedal cyclists suffering from physical defects is, however, clearly high in proportion to the number of fatal accidents in which they were involved.No accidents are attributed to colour blindness.Table XII. Previous Convictions of Drivers. It is noticeable that the number of drivers with previous con-convictions bears a higher proportion to the total number of drivers involved in fatal accidents in the case of public conveyances and of motor vans, lorries, etc., than in the case of the drivers of motor cycles and of private motor cars.Tables XIII (A) and (B). Speeds of Vehicles involved in Fatal Accidents.The first of the above two tables shows the estimated speeds of all mechanically propelled vehicles involved in fatal accidents; the second shows separate figures for areas which are built-up and those which are not.It is notoriously difficult for the police to obtain reliable evidence as to the speed at which a vehicle involved in an accident was travelling immediately beforehand. Usually the driver himself can only give an estimate, which is not likely to be on the side of excess, while the opinions of witnesses, if there are any, frequently conflict. The opinion expressed by the police must necessarily follow such evidence as they have, which is often limited to the statement of the driver concerned.The tables suggest that in the cases where an estimate of speed could be given a considerable majority of the motor vehicles in-volved in fatal accidents were proceeding at speeds not exceeding 20 miles per hour. Even in areas which are not built-up the corresponding figure is only very slightly below 50 per cent. Such a result is alone sufficient to indicate the greatest need for caution in interpreting these figures. To take as an example the private motor vehicle, it will be seen that, exclusive of 87 vehicles which were stationary or of which no estimate of speed was obtainable, 564 of the vehicles involved are shown as travelling at a speed not exceeding 20 miles per hour and 576 at a speed in excess of 20 miles per hour.Table XIV. Weather Conditions. The figures show that the great majority of accidents occurred in clear weather.  Prima facie, it would appear that conditions of low visibility lead to a reduction in accidents, probably by bringing
home to users of the highway the necessity for caution and by greatly reducing speed.Table XV. &quot;Conditions of Light.More than two-thirds of the accidents occurred in daylight, but the hours of daylight during which vehicles are normally driven considerably exceed those of darkness. When the figures for the whole of 1933 are available it will be possible to contrast those for the months when daylight is long with those when it is short.The figures relating to the quality of street lighting cannot yield much information of value in the absence of a definite standard of lighting by which the quality may be judged, and of the relative lengths of roads where it is good and where it is poor. Other factors also enter into a consideration of this subject because roads in built-up areas which carry a heavy volume of traffic are usually well lighted, while the great majority of roads outside built-up areas are not lighted at all.Table XVI. Defects and Failures in Vehicles.(The figures given in the table relate to accidents where the defect or failure was either the sole or a contributory cause of the accident.)The proportion of accidents due to defects and failures in motor cycles and pedal cycles is naturally higher than in the case of other vehicles owing to the liability of the riders to be thrown. The proportion of accidents caused by defects and failures in vehicles is low.Table XVII.Causes of Fatal Accidents.The Table gives a summary of all the causes assigned by Chief Constables to fatal accidents during the period under review divided into categories.The more important causes will be further analysed but in this table no attempt is made to distinguish between main and contri-butory causes. While, therefore, each of the causes enumerated had a bearing on a fatal accident it was not necessarily the chief cause of the accident. For example, supposing that a fatal accident was due mainly to a pedestrian stepping in front of a moving vehicle and the driver being unable to stop in the - emergency owing to his vehicle skidding, two causes would, be attributed to the accident in the above table, or three, if excessive speed on the part of the driver was also an element in the causation of the accident.
November, 1933.Drivers of Vehicles (excluding pedal cyclists).It will be noted that only in 265 of the 2,963 accidents analysed in the tables was excessive speed on the part of the driver of a vehicle recorded as a contributory cause. Reference has already been made in connection with Tables XIII (A) and (B) to the doubts attaching to estimates of speed.Inattention on the part of the driver of a vehicle was recorded as a contributory factor of 139 accidents.Pedal Cyclists.The total number of fatal accidents in which pedal cycles were contributory causes is high and in practically all of them the pedal cyclist was himself the victim.Pedestrians.Of the contributory causes attributable to pedestrians &quot; Running into the roadway &quot; is the most frequent, and next in order is &quot; Pedestrian walking or running from behind a vehicle without due care &quot;.&quot; Pedestrian apparently becoming confused or hesitating in traffic &apos;&apos; appears as a contributory cause in 242 accidents; and &quot; pedestrian apparently risking moving traffic &quot; in 204 accidents. In some cases, as explained above, both these causes may be con-tributory to the same accident. In cases of this type the speed of the vehicle concerned has a material bearing on the occurrence of the accident.Animals.&quot; Horse bolting with vehicle &quot; appears as a contributory cause in 13 accidents, &quot; dogs not under control &quot; in 12, and &quot; horse or sheep straying in the carriageway &quot; in 6.Vehicles (including pedal cycles).Apart from mechanical defects the most important cause con-tributed by vehicles to the fatal accidents under review was in-adequate front lighting which was an element of causation in 32 accidents.   Dazzling headlights contributed to 29 accidents.Actual defects in vehicles are shown to be a comparatively un-important cause of fatal accidents.As regards the remainder of the figures given in this table the most frequent contributory cause of accidents&apos; is shown to be the obscuration of the views of drivers at corners or bends. In this type of accident speed is, of course, a factor of the first importance.
RETUBN OF FATAL ACCIDENTS ON ROADS IN GREAT BRITAIN DURING THE SIX CALENDAR MONTHS ENDED 30th JUNE, 1933.Table I.Total Number of Fatal Accidents and Persons Killed.Total number of fatal accidents        ............      2,998Total number of persona killed ............      3,061Note. Thirty-five fatal accidents involving the death of thirty-six persons are excluded from the analytical tables owing to the particulars being incomplete for the purposes of the analysis or having been received too late for classification. These tables, therefore, deal with 2,963 accidents, instead of 2,998. These thirty-five accidents will be analysed in the final returns, but from the information available it does not appear that they have any special significance, or that their omission from the analysis afreets the validity of any general conclusions that may be drawn from it.Table II.Number of Fatal Accidents which occurred at each Hour of the Day.Hour.
