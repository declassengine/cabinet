o -CONFIDENTIAL. A.C.282.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. STATE OF TRADE - OCTOBER, 1933.Summary of Reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some oases with Information from other sources).Employment - Employment at 23rd October showed a further improvement.The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at 23rd October was 2,298,753, a decrease of 37,974 as compared with 25th September.     The number wholly unemployed, including casuals, decreased by 2,126, and the number temporarily stepped by 35,848.The changes between 25th September and 23rd Octoberin the different Divisions of Great Britain were:-London .................. - 3,464South Eastern.......... * 2,438South Western.......... + 6,769Midlands ............... -22,687. North Eastern.......... -19,624North Western .......... -14,228Scotland............... - 1,017Wales.................. 4-13,839The estimated number of Insured persons in employment at 23rd October was 9,925,000.     This was 44,000* more than a month before and 537,000* more than a year before.The improvement was   most marked in coalmining, engineering, vehicle building, shipbuilding and ship repairing, metal goods manufacture, the textile trades (except artificial silk yarn and ju-fe manufacture), the clothing industries (except hat and cap manufacture), the boot and shoe, pottery and glass Industries, woodworking and furniture making, and certain food manufacturing industries.*The figures for 25th September, 1933, and 24th October, 1932, have beon revised.
On the other hand the seasonal decline continued in . the hotel, hoarding house, shipping, and road transport services, In the distributive trades, and to a slight extent In building and public works contracting.     There was also some setback in iron and steel (except pig Iron), tinplate, and hat and cap manufacture.Overseas Trade.  Imports In October, 1933, were  61.8 millions compared with  60.8 millions in October, 1932.   Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  34.1 millions compared with  30.4 millions, while exports of imported merchandise were  4.6 millions compared with  3.7 millions. The excess of imports over exports of merchandise was  23.1 millions compared with  26.6 millions.Road and Rail Traffic - During the four weeks ending 29th October, 1933, the railway traffic receipts were  311,000 (2.89%) more than in the corresponding period of 1932.     Passenger traffic Increased by 0.48%, merchandise, minerals and livestock by 9,74%,    while coal, coke and patent fuel diminished by 3.49%.Registrations of motor vehicles, other than motor cycles, during September, 1933, were 763 (5.5%) greater than in the corresponding period of 1932,      There was a decrease of 596 in private cars, and an increase of 1,359 in commercial and other vehicles.      Registrations of motor cycles showed a decrease of 269 (10.2%) compared with September, 1932.Ooal - The average weekly output for the 13 weeks ended 21st October was 3,831,000 tons as compared with 3,749,000 tons for the corresponding period in 1932.     The average weekly number of wage earners was 755,300 as compared with 776,200 for the corresponding period in 1932, and the
weekly output per person was 5.07 tons as compared with 1.85 tons.Coal exports for October amounted to 3,555,000 tons which is 299,000 tons more than in October, 1932.     Exports to Sweden, Denmark, Germany, 2&apos;rance, Spain, Italy, Egypt and Canada, have improved compared with 1932.     Shipments of bunker coal amounted to 1,173,000 tons compared with 1,179,000.In Scotland the improvement previously reported has been maintained.      In the North-East Coast area the Northumberland export trade is still busy, but there is practically no change in the Durham market.     South Y/ales also shows very little change, but in the Midland district the output is rising slightly, following an improved demand for industrial coal and for coke, though there is no improvement in the house coal trade.Iron end Steel - The output of pig iron in October was 373,300 tons and of steel ingots and castings 638,300 ton3 compared with 275,600 tons and 439,800 tons respectively in October, 1932.     Domestic   demand for iron and steel remains good, and export enquiries have been more numerous.In Scotland there has been no substantial change, but there is a feeling of greater confidence in the future.      On the North East Coast xorogress has been maintained, and production is at a slightly higher level than last month, tfig iron stocks are being absorbed notwithstanding the fact that there are now 19 furnaces in blast compared with 15 at the beginning of the year.      Two additional furnaces were to be blown in during November.     Enquiries for structural steel have improved.      In South Wales the demand for heavy finished steel is still poor, but business in sheet and tinplate bars is well maintained.      The general position in Sheffield remains satisfactory.     Demand is mainly for the home market,
but there has been some improvement in exports. Alloy steels are in good demand, particularly for the motor industry, while business is also active in stainless steel.Shipaing - The freight index for October (1913 a 100) was 76.71, compared with 70.73 in the previous month and 79.49 in October, 1932.Machine topis - The home demand has improved recently. exports during October were  74,600-compared with  211,600 in October, 1932.     Exports to the Soviet Union were only  11,700 compared with ,5163,800.     It is probable that the depreciation of the dollar will make American tools more attractive to the Soviet Union.Motor industry - Home business has been satisfactory cince the Motor Show.     In the export market the restrictions -in Switzerland and Hungary are causing anxiety, and the depreciation of the dollar has improved the competitive position of American manufacturers.Electricity - The output of electricity in October,  1933, amounted to 1,246 million units compared with 1,101 million units in October, 1932.     In the first 10 months of the year there was an increase of 3.      in the amount of electricity generated.A further improvement in electrical apparatus manufacture has brought the percentage of existing productive capacity in use up to about 60$.     Market conditions for heavy plant remain practically unchanged, but there has been an improvement in the lighter branches of the industry, especially in the export market.Chemicals - Alkali sales have improved both at home and abroad.     Dyestuffs deliveries have increased in all sections. In fertilisers competition from Canada and U.S.A. is being encountered in the Vest Indies and British Guiana, and
Japanese fertilisers have &quot;been offered in Spain and Portugal. The demand for creosote is active and glass manufacturers are finding it a satisfactory substitute for heavy oil fuel.Other Industries - The home demand for motor and cycle tyres remains good but motor cycle tyres are declining. United Kingdom manufacturers have benefited by the higher duties on rubber footwear, but the placing of future orders is now disturbed by reports of possible large duty-free importations from Singapore.     Sales of soap remain normal. The demand for margarine has improved slightly.Finance and Banking - (a) London.     The gilt-edged marKet strengthened during October, partly owing to an influx of foreign money caused by the uncertainty in America, the financial difficulties of the French Government and Germany&apos;s withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference and the League. The rise in the Treasury Bill rate has continued and the rate was 7/8$ at the beginning of November.     In the foreign exchange market at the beginning of October there was a tendency for the dollar to appreciate in terms of sterling, and the pound in terms of gold;    after the announcement of President Roosevelt&apos;s gold policy,  the dollar broke sharply and continued to depreciate steadily.     The franc strengthened for a time by the reaction from the dollar.     Recent dealings in Russian Bills have been done at a discount rate of about 12% (on the unguaranteed portion) compared with 30$ a year ago,(b) France.     Between 29th September and 5rd November, the gold stocks of the Bank of France fell by francs 1,346 m. Though this loss is not substantial,  it serves as an indication of uneasiness and it appears possible that if the withdrawal of gold from the Bank of France proceeds at a rate such as to indicate a general distrust of the franc, the gold standard may be abandoned at an early stage while gold stocks are comparatively undiminished.     It is noteworthy that the
discount on forward francs has risen from 5c. for three months at the &quot;beginning of October to 30 c. by the 8th November.(c) Germany.     In anticipation of the change in the Reichsbank Law, which will make certain kinds of open-market operations permissible, there has been a steady demand for gilt-edged and other high grade German bonds.     Money rates were practically stationary.(d) U.S.A.     Criticism of the Roosevelt regime has recently become more open and insistent and production is losing momentum instead of showing the usual seasonal up-trend.     The new policy of buying gold is having the expected result of lowering the exchange value of the dollar, but so far has not raised dollar prices of commodities by a corresponding amount.The depreciation of the dollar is unli&amp;ely to help the United States export trade very considerably, as the larger part of it is in primary commodities which have a uniform world price. It may even result in a fall in world prices in terms of ^old, or even of sterling if the   remains steady.     Also the fall in the dollar will check imports into the United States and will thereby decrease the purchasing power of foreign markets for American (and also British) goods.     As regards manufactures such as machinery and motor cars, the magnitude of the lag between the fall of the dollar and the rise in manufacturing costs will determine what, if any, advantage United States exporters will gain.     The United States manufacturer has, however, to reckon with the increased cost due to the wording of the &quot;Codes&quot;. It is calculated that the costs of steel production under the &quot;Code&quot;, for example, will be increased by about 11%.If the United States persist in mantainiag a price for &quot;free&quot; gold above that of the Banic of France, it appears probable that France will abandon the gold standard.     This would mean the disappearance of the &quot;gold bloc&quot; and the end of America&apos;s attempt to raise commodity prices by raising the price of gold,
as such a policy pre-supposes the existence of at least one gold standard country.From the point of view of the United Kingdom this would he of grave concern as her chief competitors are in Europe and not America.Canadian Trade.     The index of business operations rose from 89.8 in August to 90.8 in September,  1933.     kost branches of products and industry showed an expansion.      The index of wholesale prices fell slightly in September compared with the previous month, the main decline being in crop products and non-ferrous metals.     Exports and re-exports in September were $58,329,000 compared with $45,135,000 in August, while imports were $38,698,000 compared with $38,747,000.      The favourable balance of trade was greater than in any recent month except October,  1932.South.African Trade.       Conditions of trade continue to show improvement mainly on account of the enhanced price now received for gold.The exports for September (including gold valued at  6.9s.0d. per fine ounce) amounted to  9,655,000 compared with  9,586,000 in the previous year while imports were  4,444,000 compared with  2,504,000.     Railway traffic receipts show an increase compared with a year ago, and Customs and Excise and Postal receipts have improved.     Activity in gold mining continues at a high level and manufacturing industry shows steady progress.      In many farming areas the drought continues and prices of farm products have risen steeply.     V/caol prices weakened at recent sales but are still 100% above those of last year.      The latest estimate of the wool clip is 740,000 bales o 255,000,000 lbs.Australian Trade.      Imports during September,  1953, were  6,122,000 compared with  6,440,000 in the previous year.     No export figures are yet available.
The price of wool continues to advance satisfactorily, from an average of  16.6s.7(2. per hale at the end of August to  l7.16s.8d. per hale during September.The Sydney hank clearings from January to the end of October were  719,000,000 compared with  541,000,000 in the corresponding period of the previous year.     Melbourne figures also showed a similar but smaller advance.     Increases were also noted in Customs and Postal Revenue returns.Indian Trade.     Imports of merchandise in September 1933 were 875 lakhs of rupees compared with 1,141 lakhs in September, 1932;    exports were 1,165 lakhs compared with 1,261 lakhs.     For October, 1933, imports were 1,062 lakhs compared with 998 lakhs in October,  1932;    exports were 1,291 lakhs compared with 1,176 lakhs.Imports in October, 1933, were the highest since Marsh last. They were considerably higher than in September,  1933, and also higher than in October,  1932.     Exports were higher than in the previous month, and also higher than in October,  1932, but were lower than the August figure of 1,434 lakhs.     Exports of gold at 335 lakhs were, except for July, lower than any month since May,  1932.     As a result of the decline in the exports of gold the balance of trade figures fell to 561 lakhs as compared with 860 lakhs in the previous month and 746 lakhs for October,  1932.The wholesale price index for both September and October was 88 compared with 89 in August, and 91 in July.     Reports regarding weather and crop prospects are,  on the whole, favourable.     The crop forecasts for the season 1933/34 so far issued indicate an increase in the estimated area&quot; sown, except in the case of rice which shows a very slight decline.
