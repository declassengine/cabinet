(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GCvEENMENT,)COPY NO. h-lOA B I N. E TPRESS VIEWS ON AIR DISARMAMENT.-    SSiS-feZ- the&apos; Secretary of State for Air., 1,       At the meeting of the Cabinet on the 6th Instant, mention was made of representations by the Society of Friends on the subject of an increase in the strength of the Royal Air Force..2..       I think it may interest my colleagues to know that I have had as complete an analysis as possible made of such comment as has appeared alike in the London and the Provincial morning, evening, and Sunday Press on this subject.    In the provinces, in particular j, almost every newspaper of any standing has commented editorially at considerable length.3.       It is impossible, in the nature of the case, to Classify the results except under a few broad headings, but the figures below give,,I believe, a reasonably accurate analysis. Out of sixty-two newspapers examined, forty-four definitely support a One-Power Standard in the air, to be achieved by an Increase in our own strength,, If other Powers will not reduce. Two favour something more than a One-Power Standard, i.e*- that Great Britain should possess the most powerful Air Force in. the world.    Twelve, while not content with our present inferiority, regard any policy of re-armament as dangerous, some urging also that it provides no real security.    One urges at least completion of the 1923 programme, while one (the Daily Worker) opposes a One-Power Standard on principle,.    Finally, two express grave concern at our weakness in the air, but have no definite policy to advocate.4.        In short, forty-six out of sixty-two, or 74/ , definitely support at least a One-Power Standard in the air;    and only thirteen, or under 21%y oppose an increase In the Royal Air Force on general &quot;pacifist&quot; grounds, these Including the Daily Worker.    Of these thirteen, however, seven belong to the same group of newspapers j    the four morning journals In this group have identical texts, while the phraseology in the three evening papers clearly bears the imprint of common Inspiration.    The odd 5% admit, the seriousness of the situation, but for the most part are &quot;sitting on the fence&quot; as regards the remedy.S E C R E T o CP, 505 (55).Air Ministry,12th December, 1933,
