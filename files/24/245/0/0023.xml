THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTLEAGUE OF NATIONS. December 8, 1933.CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.[W 1M17/40/98] No. 1.Sir John Simon to Mr. Campbell (Paris). (No. 1903.) .Sir, Foreign Office, December 8, 1933.IN view of Sir Eric Phipps&apos;s telegram No. 280 of the 7th December reporting that the French Ambassador in Berlin had been instructed to inform Chancellor Hitler that the suggested German rearmament caused the gravest concern to the French Government and that the Saar plebiscite must take place in 1935, I asked M. Corbin to see me this morning. Lord Tyrrell and Sir Robert Vansittart were also present. We said that this message gave us some concern, since the execution of such instructions at this moment might cut across the demarche which we had set in motion yesterday by our telegram No. 238 to Berlin, the purpose and text of which we had communicated in advance through the French Ambassador to his Government. The object of our message to Chancellor Hitler was to invite him to revise his proposals, but at the same time to show our interest in them as providing a possible basis for a political agreement; might not the French communication cut short these efforts and possibly even lead Chancellor Hitler to suggest that the French and ourselves were at cross-purposes ?2. M. Corbin thought that the instructions to M. Francois-Poncet were due to the pressure of the Foreign Affairs Committee and to the need of satisfying French opinion by showing that others besides Chancellor Hitler could express forcible opinions. He did not imagine that the communication would be couched in brusque terms; the report we had received was necessarily abbreviated. At the same time he undertook to communicate at once with the Quai d&apos;Orsay reporting our reaction, on the chance that the instructions had not yet been carried out.3. M. Corbin called on Sir Robert Vansittart this afternoon. He had been in communication with his Government and confirmed that instructions in the foregoing sense had been sent to Berlin. He seemed to think, however, that the instructions were less brusque in form than they had appeared to us, and he argued at some length, firstly, that the French Government could not possibly have sent any other instructions, and,&quot; secondly, that the instructions need not necessarily have the effect of interrupting, the conversations which might be set in motion by the action taken at Berlin by His Majesty&apos;s Government. M. Corbin was reminded in reply that we were engaged in the first steps of an exploration, and that it would probably be very unwise to interrupt or impede them. There might be two results of such an exploration : firstly, that the true nature of the German position would be exposed; and, secondly, and at best, that the German demands might gradually be so whittled away that some kind of all-round settlement might be shown to be possible. Sir Robert Vansittart strongly disputed M. Corbin&apos;s view that as a result of our enquiries we should be led further down the road of rearmament. M. Corbin said that he had very little hope of securing the modification of the instructions sent to the French Ambassador in Berlin, but that he did not see why the execution of such instructions should prevent Franco-German conversations. In reply Sir Robert Vansittart pointed out that the nature of the instructions was a couple of negatives, and this did not seem a very happy opening for bringing the German Government on to positive ground. It was, however, to be hoped that the Ambassador&apos;s diagnosis was correct and that these instructions would not prove the obstacle or discouragement that had seemed possible earlier in the day. Much would no doubt depend upon the tone in which M. Francois-Poncet carried them out.I am, &amp;c.JOHN SIMON.[995 h-1]133
