THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET COPY&apos; HQ-,CTP0287 (33). C A B I H Eg.The Trish Free Situation.Memorandum by the Secretary of State, forDominion Affairs.1. I have been thinking over the wording of paragraphs 4 and 5 of the draft reply to Mr.de Valera-as settled at the meeting cf the Irish Situation Committee yesterday morning, and I am very anxious about the situation.    I am seriously disturbed that these paragraphs will be Interpreted in the sense that wo de contemplate the possibility of the use of armed force to prevent the Irish Free State from establishing Itself as a Republic.    The consequences which might flow from such an interpretation are so serious that I feel it my duty to ask my colleagues to oonsider further the question of the precise terms to be employed.2&apos;:9       I fully appreciate the force of the arguments for not committing ourselves at this stage and for leaving Mrode Valera guessing.    But I would ask my colleagues to weigh carefully the oonsequenoes which may result from the use d? words open to the Interpretatif that we have not ruled out the Idea of war*3\o (l) Mrode Valera himself may fasten upon the words and use them to Inflame further the anti-British
British feeling on which the success of his policy largely depends.   He may either assert that our answer shows that we do not intend to rule out war or he may challenge us to give an answer Yes or rio to his question.    We should he driven in the end to defino our attitude.(2) The Opposition would almost certainly seize upon the words and seek to make party capital out of them.(3) Moderate opinion in this country may also criticise the words on the ground that they l3nply the possibility of war.(4) There seems to me a real danger of our attitude being misunderstood in the Dorainlons and. the world generally.    I would especially refer to the risks involved In alienating public opinion in the Union of South Africa and the United States.49      I therefore take the unusual step of asking my colleagues to re-examine very carefully the wording of the paragraphs in question.5*     On thinking the matter over again I should prefer the riording of paragraph 4 of my original draft as anended by a suggestion made at the meeting yesterday by the Chancellor of the Exchequer *    Paragraph 4 and paragraph 5 (altered consequentially) would then read as follows (the alterations made are underlined):-
&quot;4e.   As to the future, paragraph 5 of your despatch is in of feet an inquiry whether His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have decided not te treat &quot;as a cause of war or other aggressive action&quot; a decision of the people of the Irish Free State to sever their connection with the British Commonwealtho    As to this I desire to make it quite clear that His Ma.1 esty*s Government in the United Kingdom have never considered the possibility^ of attempting to Prevent such action by1 armed force&quot;5o     It Is right however that I should draw attention to some of the results which must inevitably suchensue if/a severance took place, though I need hardly state that we should view with the most profound regret the occurrence of these consequences..&quot; The Chancellor&apos;s amendment   seems to me sufficiently to safeguard our right to use armed force against aggression e*g* for the defence of Northern Ireland and the Defended Port3 o6*       If however ray colleagues feel that they are not prepared at this stage to go so far as this, I would especially invite attention to the opening words of paragraph 5 of the draft circulated In CP.281, &quot;Apart, however, from any other consequences of such a step&quot;* Having regard to the fact that the economic and pefsonal consequences are referred to later, I fear that these particular words could only be interpreted as referring to
to armed force, and I would suggest their omission. Paragraphs 4 and 5 would then read as follows:-!,4&apos;.i     As to the future, paragraph 5 of your despatch is in effect an enquiry whether His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have decided not to treat &quot;as a cause of war or other aggressive action&quot; a decision of the people of the Irish Free State to sever their connection with the British Commonwealths    In reply I have to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have taken no decision, and feel themselves under no obligation to take a decision, upon the course which they would take if the Irish Free State were to repudiate its Treaty obligations in the manner suggested^&quot;!,5o      It is right, however, that I should draw attention to some of the results which must inevitably ensue if such a severance took place, though I need hardly state that we should view with the most profound regret the occurrence of these consequences 7i* I have one further (though less important)alteration to suggest with regard to the wording of paragraph 6&apos;.     It appears to me advisable to indicate that the Irish Free State would not necessarily become a foreign country immediately on the declaration of a Republic by Ivlr.de Valera party0    Such a declaration might be followed by civil war,as
Boas happened over the attempted secession of the Southern States in 1861.    In any case the Irish Free State could not he treated as a foreign country unless and until her independence was recognised.80     From this point of view it would, I think be preferable to word paragraph 6 as follows&quot;If the Irish Free State should sever its connexion with the British Commonwealth and become a Republic, she would be a foreign country and in economic matters would have to be treated as a foreign country^ 119*     I am sure my colleagues will realise how important it is that no mistake should bo made at this stage, and it is on account of the possible ultimate reactions that I strongly press for some modification of the terms of the proposed despatch^DOMINIONS OFFICE P1st December,1933.
