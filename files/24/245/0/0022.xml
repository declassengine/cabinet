THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1933.SECRET. Copy No. 41CP. 301a (33).CABINET._ 13USE OF TEAR GAS IN PALESTINE.Addendum to Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I THINK I should let my colleagues know that since I circulated the memorandum CP. 301 (33), I have had some conversation with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs about the use of tear gas by the police authorities in the United States. Mr. Eden has now drawn my attention to the fact that at the end of April this year a corrected text of Part 4 of the British Draft of the Disarmament Convention was produced, and that Article 54 as amended reads as follows : &quot; The High Contracting Parties shall inform the Permanent Disarma-ment Commission of the lachrymatory substances intended to be used by their authorities for police operations as well as of the number of the various appliances by means of which they are to be utilised.&quot;This clause, I think, completely safeguards our position. The Article was drafted specially to meet the point of view of the United States Government, who rely very largely on tear gas for police purposes, and the amendment quoted above was arranged at the instance of the United States Delegate to the Disarmament Conference.(Initialled) P. C.-L.Downing Street, December 15, 1933.[9409]
