Th i a document is the property of His Britannic Ma j e sty &apos; s Government.SECRET . Copy Wo .  c!t. . .C .P . 2 92 (3 3 ) . C A 3 I SEJD .SHOPS____BILL .Memorandum by the. Home Se cretary.A promise was given in the King-1 s Speech to submit legislation dealing with the hours of employment of young persons and other conditions in the distributive trades, and a Bill is accordingly being drafted for this purpose.The Chief Whip has suggested that if the Bill can be passed by the Cabinet and read a first time before the Recessj  its second reading might conveniently be taken on the first day after the Recess.      Arrangements are therefore being made to get the Bill ready for consideration by the Home Affairs Committee on Monday, the 18th instant, with a view to  its being finally approved by the Cabinet on Wednesday, the 20th, and introduced and read a first time on the 21st.The Bill - which is based on certain unanimous recom-mendations of the Select Committee on Shop Assistants, which reported in 1931 - will fall into two  sections.      The first will deal with-the hours of employment of all young persons (14-18 years of age) employed in or about the business of a shop   (wholesale or retail) and any warehouse connected with any such shop, or employed in retail trade in any other premises.      These provisions, which will cover young persons employed in outdoor duties as well as indoor staff, will aPPly5  it is estimated, to something like 400,000 young persons.      The  second section will contain provisions in regard to health and welfare conditions affecting all persons
employed in shops  (wholesale or retail) or In any warehouse connected therewith.There is nothing in the second section with which I need trouble my colleagues at this stage, but as regards the first section there is a question on which I depire to obtain a decision of the Cabinet before final instructions are given to the draftsman.The proposals with regard to hours of employment have been the subject of prolonged discussion with representatives of the chief Trade Associations and in regard to most of them something approaching complete agreement has been reached.      In regard, however, to the main proposal, namely,  the fixing of a general weekly maximum of hours (to replace an antiquated provision in the Shops Acts limiting the weekly hours of young persons to 74, Inclusive of meal times) considerable controversy has arisen, and it is on this point that - with the concurrence of the Secretary of state for Scotland - I desire at once to obtain the decision of the cabinet.      The Select Committee unanimously recommended a weekly limit of 48 hours, exclusive of meal intervals, and there will undoubtedly be a strong feeling in the House of commons In favour of this limit.     On the other hand the Trade Associations, while accepting the principle of a general weekly limit, have almost all made strong representations that a limit of 48 hours would result in great dislocation of present arrangements and would seriously prejudice their business, and have asked for a substantially higher limit.      Some of the Associations have claimed a limit of 54 hours or more, but the bulk of the traders as represented by the National Chamber of Trade and affiliated Associations, and the Federation of Grocers&apos;
Associations, are prepared to accept a limit of  52 hours, which would mean a working week, including meal intervals, of something like 60 hours.My own vie?/ is that a limit of 48 hours would be the right limit in more normal times, but I feel that there is a strong case for agreeing to a higher limit during present difficulties, and it is clearly desirable to carry the traders (who have otherwise shown themselves very accommodating) with us as far as possible.      My proposal, therefore, is that 52 hours  (exclusive of meal intervals) should be fixed In the Bill as the limit, but that this should be coupled with a provision that the maximum weekly hours shall be reduced to 48 after a period of three years from the commencement of the Act,  if, after the expiration of that period, a resolution to this effect is passed by both Houses of Parliament.      (There is a precedent for this procedure in the Goal Mines Act, 1919).      These provisions would prevent any serious dislocation of business during the next three years at any rate, while at the same time recognising 48 hours as a reasonable and proper limit and facilitating Its ultimate adoption.It is proposed to supplement the weekly hours with a limited amount of overtime to meet periods of pressure. Overtime was contemplated by the Select Committee, but under their proposals, which applied to adults as well as young persons,  the overtime was to be fixed by national and local Advisory Boards.      No such Boards will be set up under the Bill, and it is therefore necessary to fix the amount of overtime in the Bill.      I propose a yearly allowance of 24 hours1 overtime - which, In the event of the weekly limit being reduced to 48, would be automatically increased to 50 - subject to certain conditions as to the.maximum number
HOME OFFICE: 9th December,of hours for which a young person may he employed In any week, and the number of weeks in which overtime may be worked in the establishment.      The National Chamber of Trade and others have asked for a somewhat higher allowance, and this is a point on which perhaps some concession might be made,  if necessary,  in the Standing Committee.I accordingly recommend that the hours of employment for young persons should be fixed at a weekly maximum of 52, with a yearly allowance of 24 hours&apos; overtime,  subject to a provision for reduction after three years to a weekly maximum of 48 with a yearly allowance of 50 hours&apos; overtime.J.G.
