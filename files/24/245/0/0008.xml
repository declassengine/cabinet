Text of Reply to Irish Free State despatch no.  142 of 29th November, 1935.(as approved by Cabinet Committee on December 4th 1933, at 9.30 p.m.).Irish Free State. Downing Street.N2^-i-0i- 5th December,  1933.oir ,I have the honour to state that your despatch No:. 142 of the 29th November has received our careful cohsideration.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom cannot accept the description of the relations between the two countries set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of your despatch. They have stated their view as to the 1921 settlement in my despatch of the 9th April 1932 in the following words: -&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom entered into the 1921 Settlement with the single desire that it should end the long period of bitterness between the two countries and it is their belief that the Settlement has brought a measure of peace and contentment which could not have been reached by any other means.      Further, as the direct result of that Settlement, the Irish Free State has participated in and contributed to the notable constitutional developments of the last few years, whereby the position of the Dominions as equal Members with the United Kingdom of the British Commonwealth of Nations under the Crown, has been defined and made clear to the world&quot;.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom-i-
would point out that the Treaty Settlement was duly accepted by the elected representatives of the people of the Irish Free State, and that its acceptance was subsequently confirmed at succeeding General Elections in the Irish Free State.      The period which elapsed between 1921 and 1932 was marked by the progressive development of friendly relations and co-operation between the two countries.4.-        Since His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are thus unable to accept the assumption in paragraph 5 of your despatch, namely that lasting friendship cannot be attained on the basis of the present relationship, they do not  see any grounds for answering a question which is founded on that assumption.        They cannot believe that the Irish Free State Government contemplate the final repudi-ation of their Treaty obligations in the manner suggested, and consequently they do not feel called upon to  say what attitude they would adopt in circumstances which they regard as purely hypothetical.5. In conclusion I \;ould state that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom feel that the free intercourse on equal terms with the other members of the British Commonwealth which the Irish Free State have enjoyed under the Treaty Settlement, culminating in the Statute of Westminster, is the surest proof of their freedom to work out their own destiny within the Commonwealth. We believe that the natural associations between the two countries are such that a close and friendly relationship-ii-
between them is essential to their full prosperity, and I would once again emphasise what I have previously stated on many occasions, namely, that His Majesty&apos;s Government  in the United Kingdom are, and always have been, most  sincerely anxious to work in friendly co-operation with the Irish Free Stats as a member of the British Commonwea1 th.I have, etc,(Signed) J.H.THOMAS.
