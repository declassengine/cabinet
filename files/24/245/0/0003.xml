Il, IXX3UMBNT 13 l&apos;HB PROPERTY OF HIG BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;b GOVERNMENT.4 0^LORET o COPY NO,__CP. NO.  233(33)CABINET. Indo-Japanese Trade Negotiations. Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.The Government of India are &quot;being presc-ed &quot;by theJapanese Government to agree to make a concession in regardto the subdivision of the cotton piece goods quota (seeAppendix), the effect of which would &quot;be to put up theproposed Japanese quota for bleached goods (though not thetotal piece goods quota.) from 32 million yards to 72 million yards.     This is a trade which is of great importance toLancashire, and the Japanese have eaten Into it in the lasttwo years.     Their imports into India in the five years1928-1931 averaged 23 million yards;   they doubled their trade in 1931 and again in 1932 when (thanks to the depreciation of the yen and to the &quot;boycott against Lancashire)they imported 110 million yards,,     The imports fromLancashire of these goods have declined.2. A telegram was sent to the Government of India onFriday urging them to stand firm.     A telegram from theViceroy received on Saturday (which crossed ours ) suggeststhat they are thinking of giving way03, The Japanese pressure is Indicated bys-(a ) continuance of &quot;boycott of Indian cotton during negotiationsj(&quot;b ) somewhat peremptory tone of their last reply;(c) representations &quot;by Japanese Foreign Office to our Embassy there - suggesting that it is the United Kingdom (not India) that is holding up a settlement and that this night &quot;be represented as &quot;&quot;bad faith&quot;;(d; representations to same effect to Foreign Office &quot;by Japanese Ambassador here;    and
(e) the refusal of the Japanese Delegation here to talk to the Lancashire people about other markets until the Indian question has been settled.4. In view of concessions which the Government of India have already made in the course of the negotiations, there is reason to believe that, even if no further concession to Japan were made, the Lancashire interests will in any case be displeased with the quota settlement, which does not go as far in curtailing Japanese imports as they had hoped.      If the Government of India concede the 10&apos;o variation which the Japanese are demanding we shall have to face the severest criticism by Lancashire.      It will also be urged that this is proof of the unwisdom of the fiscal Autonomy Sonvention, and of the proposals in the &quot;White Paper.     The treaty between the Government of India and the Government of Japan will no   doubt be the subject of debate in our Parliament, and we shall have Lancashire up in arms and all the dissentients shouting at us.-(i) because the agreement concedes too much to Japan, and(ii) because, although we knew what was needed in the interests of Lancashire, we had not interfered.5. In view of the fall in the dollar,  the Government ofIndia appear to believe that unless they make an agreement with japan embodying an undertaking to buy Indian cotton in returnfor a cotton piece goods quota,  there will be no market for indian cotton.Japan has always been a much heavier purchaser of Indian cotton than Lancashire but (following upon the Ottawa Agreement) strenuous efforts are being made by Lancashire interests to encourage and develop the use of Indian cotton,  and the consumption shows sign of going up;    these efforts would be materially discouraged if Lancashire felt that her interests hac not been adequately safeguarded in the Indo-Japenese Agreement.
6.    In considering this question, both we and the Government of India ought to take account of the possible reactions of their decision on the general economic and political relations between the United Kingdom and India.     In the Ottawa Agreement we went a long way to ensure to India the United Kingdom market for products in which India is interested, incurring a good deal of opposition from interests such as the Dundee jute people, who are being driven out of the market by Indian jute manufacturers, and the users of linseed, who were hit by our concession to the Indian linseed grower.7.    It has been suggested that, owing to the height of the Indian duties, the Japanese fear that they will not be able to reach the full quota on the &quot;plain greys&quot;, and this is being put forward as an excuse for the further demand.8.   An immediate decision is called for and I would ask the Cabinet (1) to suggest to the Government of India the necessity for refusing to give way to the Japanese demand;    and (2) to say that if the Japanese fear about the &quot;plain greys&quot; should prove in fact to be well-founded we should not object to an offer to reconsider the duties on these goods.T. R.Board of Trade,27th November, 1933.
APPENDIX.INLO-JAPANESE OFFICIAL NEGOTIATIONS . Limitation of Japanese imports by categories,1.    The Lancashire Delegation at on early stage in their discussions with the Government of India urged, in the interests both of Indian and British mills, that not only should the imports from Japan be limited in total quantity, but also that each of the main categoriis of cotton goods should be subject to a separate limitstion, otherwise the Japanese industry would te able to utilise an undue proportion of the total quota in securing business in lines in which she has hitherto not specialised - to the disadvantage of former suppliers of such goods and to the disorganisation of the market as a whole.     In this connection, the Delegation submitted statistics of trade in past years showing how the quota might be divided between the six main categories (see paragraph 4 below).     The Government of India accepted this in principle but during the course of the negotiations they conceded to Japan a reduction of the categories from six to four.2,    The Japanese Government have accepted the four categories but are pressing for an arrangement which will permit a percentage of the total quota to be transferred from one category to another: they requested in the first place that this percentage should be set at 15$, but at a later stage they said that they would agree,, to 1055.     The Government of India were disposed to offer 5Ji (the Board of Trade views on this were included in a message sent to the Government of India on the 24th November), but now desire to go further and agree to the Japanese proposal of 10fo.3.    In making this proposal it seems clear that the Japanese are afraid that they will not be able to achieve their full category quota in the plain greys category (by reason of the competition of the Indian mills, protected by high Indian
duties) and they desire to he able to make up any loss under this heeding Toy transfer to the bleached goods category, in which they feel they will he able to make headway against Lancashire.4.    The categories proposed by the Government of India and the average trade in those categories in previous years are as follows:-jYears 1926/27 to 1929/30 (suggested by Lancashire).in greys....&quot;ered greys, ched goods, used cottonAverage Trade,Years 1928/31Million yards,213 39 7113372388Japanese quota (without any trans-fereble allowance and on basis of maximum of 40Cm.yds.) ,jLlillion yards.180 52 32136400If, as suggested in paragraph 3, the Japanese would concentrate the transferable allowance on the bleached goods category that category would be increased from 32 million yards to 52 million yprds by a 5$ transferable allowance, and to 72 million yards by a 10/j allowance.     These figures r.re considerably in excess of the average Japanese trade in bleached goods as shown above, and also exceed the average for the years 1928 to 1932 (a period including the year of the boycott and depreciated yen), viz., 41 million yards.     The actual Japanese and United Kingdom trade in these goods during the past five years has been as followst-ports.m United ngdomm Japan. .1928.535 4,31929.446 91930.193xilillion yards.305 26198 541932,269 1101933 (to August)15165
5.    It seems probable that Lancashire will draw the conclusionnot only that her main trade, i,e.,  in bleached goods, has been selected for special concessions to Japan but also that theIndian mills have been rather favourably treated.      Thefollowing average trade figures would support this view,    India is mainly interested in the first two groups and Lancashire in 1he last two.Average imports Japan 1988/31	from	Japanese quotas	Curtailment Increase (-*-) Japanese averaj	-) or of ?e trade.
