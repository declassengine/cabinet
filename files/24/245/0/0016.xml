[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)iBOPETo P.S96(33),COPY NO,CABINET, THE ROAD TRA.FFIC (COMPENSATION FOR ACCIDENTS) BILLANDROAD TRAFFIC ( EMERGENCY TREATMENT) BILL. Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.In the last two sessions of Parliament Lord Danesfort has introduced into the House of Lords a Bill, entitled the Road Traffic (Compensation for Accidents) Bill, the principal object of which is to enable persons injured on the road by a motor vehicle to recover compensation in certain circumstances without proof of negligence on the part of the defendant.      The Bill has undergone many changes since it was first presented on the 27th April, 193S, notably as a result of reference to a Select Committee presided over by Lord Iveagh.      The spokesmen for the Government have been careful not to commit the Government to acceptance of its principles or to find time for its further consideration.      Lord Danesfort has stated that he intends to reintroduce the Bill and I do not think .that we can any longer avoid declaring our attitude towards its main provisions.The main feature of the Bill is the provision that where bodily injury (including fatal injury) to a person &quot;is caused by or arises out of the use of a motor vehicle on a road or in a place to which the public have a right of access&quot; damages shall be recoverable from the owner of the motor vehicle except where the injury was solely due to the negligence of the injured person.This provision does not apply to persons driving In or being carried by a motor vehicle and its beneficial operation is, in effect, limited to pedestrians, persons in horse-drawn vehicles, and pedal cyclists.
In the assessment-of - damages account is to &quot;he talten,-of the degree in which negligence on the part of the Injured person has contributed to the accident,.      The clause Is not to apply-where a vehicle which causes an accident is unlawfully in possession of some person&apos;other than the owner, and the owner may in certain circumstances recover from a third party the damages said by the owner.where the third party incurred a legal liability (e.g0 through negligence) for, those damagescIt Is further provided that no payment of money or offer Of assistance by a motorist to an injured person shall be cited as proof of admission of negligence,,Ifl proposing to enable injured pedestrians and pedal cyclists to recover damages from the owner of- a motor vehicle without having to prove negligence on his part or on the part of the driver and in thus shifting the onus of proof and placing the liability on the owner of the vehicle as such, the Bill departs, from the common law principle that in order to recover damages an injured person must prove the negligence ef the defendant, or of persons for whom the defendant is responsible.There is a feeling, for which no doubt there is some justification, that in many cases injured pedestrians are unable to secure compensation in circumstances in which they are justly entitled to it.      In a fatality, or where the injured person is dazed by the accident, the evidence may be one-sided,,     However raoidly the police or other parties arrive on the spot, ,thay may hear only one side of the case and the accident may too -readily be attributed to the pedestrian not exercising due care.     Apart from this consideration, ueople with limited means may be unable or unwilling to oursue their claims against powerful insurance,&quot;&apos; companies or to hold out lor adequate compensation.There are, however, substantial objections to this proposal which may well outweigh   its advantages -
(l)    I do not consider that the passage ol the Bill wouldhave any effect in reducing accidents.      Indeed, in so far as it induced a feeling in the minds of motorists that the consequences of negligence on their oart would fall upon the insurance companies, legislation on these lines might have an adverse effect on the accident rate.(2)    If the proposal were adopted, it would certainly lead to some increase in premiums.      The insurance companies gave Lord Iveagh&apos;s Committee no indication of the kind of increase which might be necessary, but the justifiable increase might prove to be of the order of 10 to 20 per cent.For this and other reasons the  ill would be opposed in the House of Commons and strongly resisted by the motoring organisations.It would involve &amp; complete departure from the general principles of law.      This is tue most formidable objection to the proposal and, indeed, I think it would be difficult to reject the Bill except on this ground.Is a matter u-ion which the legal members of the Government may particularly desire to express their views and I circulate with this memorandum a note with which the -attorney-General has been good enough   to furnish me.I ought perhaps to point out that it Is argued in favour of the Bill that it embodies a principle already adopted by most European countries^     Vhile this appears to be true as a general statement, the position varies considerably as between one. country and another.ROAD TRAFFIC (EMERGENCY TRLATHKNT) BILL.This Bill, introduced by Lord Hoynihan, was read a second time in the House of Lords on the 5th December, 1933.The Bill provides th: t a medical practitioner or a hospital that renders xirst-aid treatment (or &quot;emergency treatment&quot; as defined in the Bill) to a person injured in a motor accioent shall be entitled to recover as remuneration from the owner of any motor vehicle involved in the accident, or his personal representative, a fee of twelve shillings and sixpence, nnd in addition the sum of  sixpence xor every mile or pert of a mile in excess of  two mi lea which v. medical practitioner has hrd to cover in order to treat the injured ptrson.(3) This
-4 -   - 115.Clause 4 provides that the liabilities imposed by the Bill shall be third party risks to which Part II of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, applies, &apos;Apart from some points of machinery, which could be met by amendment, the main objection, on principle, to the Bill is that it runs counter to established principles of common law, and would fasten a liability on a man in respect of an event for which he might not be In the slightest degree responsible.      To take an extreme instance;    a pedal cyclist or the driver of a horse-drawn vehicle might run into a stationary motor car and injure himself or a passenger in the motor car;    the owner of the motor car (whether he was present at the time or not) would be liable to pay the remuneration of the doctor or hospital rendering emergency treatment.      It is true that in such a case the owner of the vehicle would be entitled to recover the amount paid from any person responsible for the accident, but quite apart from the difficulty- of fixing any legal liability on account of negligence, the owner of the motor vehicle, in view of the trouble to which he would be put, would in most cases hardly think it worth whilt: to institute proceedings   in order to recover a sum of twelve shillings and sixpence.The Select Committee, on an earlier 3111 of last Session presided over by Lord Iveagh, recognised an appearance of injustice in throwing this cost on the motoring community as in many cases the motorist is under no legal liability for the accident, but they saw no other way of assuring, to the medical . profession a payment to which the Committee considered them entitled.Lord -&quot;oynihan has stated that 25,000 motor accident casualties wore taken into voluntary hospitals as in-patients during the year 1931 at a cost to the hospitals of  225,000, while the payments received irom insurance companies under Section 35(2) of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, amounted only to
 35,000.      The sub-section of the 1930 Act referred to made no provision for payment in respect of treatment as out-patients. Section 33 of the Road and Rail Act of 1933, which now supersedes it, provides tor payment in respect of the treatment of out-patients up to a maximum of  5 and also increases the maximum sum payable in respect of in-patients from  25 to  50, and the fact that some charge has been made by the hospital for treatment is no longer relevant.      To this extent the hospitals will benefit.      The provisions of the Act of 1933, however, following in this respect the precedent of the Act of 1930, are limited to payments arising out of accidents in respect of which liability rests on the driver of the vehicle on account of his negligence.      Neither the Act of 1930 nor the Act of 1933 provides for any remuneration to be paid to medical practitioners as such.Th&apos;&quot;t both hospitals and doctors have a substantial grievance on the ground that they are frequently put to considerable expense in providing first-aid treatment in cases of road accidents without receiving any remuneration cannot be denied, but the particular remedial measures proposed in this Bill seem to me unsound in principle and unjust in their operation,,MINOR Ai^^llJNTS OF PART II QP T:D-l ROAD TRAFFIC - &quot;ACT&quot;, 19357 &quot;Apart from the Issues raioed in these two Bills, I amconsidering the poscibility of amending Part II of the road traffic Act, 1950.      It was made clear to Parliament at the time that the scheme of compulsory insurance against third partyricks was not complete, but it may now be possible and desirableto fill up one or two of the gaps, and particularly to provide that, where the motorist himself is killed or dies in the period
between an accident and the settlement oi any claim arising out oi the accident, proceedings for the recovery of damagea arising out oi the accident should not thereby be invalidated. This also Involves a departure from the common law -principle that the right of personal action ceases with the death of the person against whom tht action is brought, but the application of this principle may operate very harshly against the- injured party and I think a change would be justified.(Initialled)    0-F.G.S.Ministry of Transport. 11th December, 1935.,
itsTHE ROAD TRAFFIC ((X3MPEN3ATION FOR ACCIDENTS) BILL. &apos; NOTL Bf THE ATTORNEY-GI-ai: RALBCleuse 1 of the Bill is the important one.      In effect it seeks to include motor vehicles, driven upoxi the publics highway, within the category of oangerous things to which the principle of Rylands -v- Fletcher applies.     But the Bill makes an extension of this princjple;    I.e. the liability of motorists under this Bill would be greater than that of occupiers of land under Rylands -v- Fletcher.One exception to the liability under that rule is the Act ef God.   Nichols -v- Marshland (1675) L.R.10 Exe255*      The Act of God is defined in Nugent **v- Smith,,    (1876) 1 o.p.&amp;*itM.. &quot;The Act of God is a mere short way of expressing this proposition.     A common carrier is not liable for any acciuent es to which he can show that it is due to natural causes directly and exclusively without human intervention and that it could not have been prevented by any amount of foresight and pains and care reasonably to have been expected of him.&quot;In effect the Bill seeks to make the insurers of motorists insure also pedestrians and pedal cyclists against Injuries from motor aociuents not caused solely by their negligence, &quot;but caused by inevitable accident cr the Act of God.      It is a question of policy whether or not this should be done but it seems a remarkable proposition that motor insurers ere to take on the liability of insuring pedestrians against acts of God and inevitable accidents in whioh motor vehicles ere involved.     The principle which has seemed hitherto to have guided the law is that these occurrences ere the common risks of mankind, which all mortals must share alike.     It may be wise to have all pedestrians insured against such acts of God or inevitable accidents but I see no reason wiry one section of the public should be atiied to bear the expense.
Ill;; 119If the motorist is to be allowed the defences of act of God and inevitable accident we ore back at the present position except that (a) the onus of proof is shifted from the Plaintiff to the Defendant and (b) that contributory negligence is degraded from a defence to 8 plea in mitigation of damages,Ae regaras (a) tnis is the real position today, though not in strict theory.     In running-down cases if there is a scintilla of evidence sufficient to &quot;get the case on its legs&quot;, (and I have never known a case of any merits where there was much difficulty in doing that), the onus shifts and the Defendant has to satisfy the Court he was not responsible.As records (b) I think the proposals in the Bill would be ineffective and would lead to strange resultsB     Most of the damages In running-down asses are unliquidated in the strictest sense.     The jury, or the Judge (if there is no jury) are left completely at large to say whet should be the monetary compensation appropriate for s complicated series of Injuries to a man in a certain station of life.     To modify this figure by on attempt nicely to calculate the degree of contributory negligence is on attempt which might be all right in theory but it would, I think, add to the present diversity in verdicts. It would moreover be strangely anomalous to say thet contributory negligence is a uefence to all actions for negligence except in tho&amp;e cases where the Defendant is the owner of e motor vehicle.Another exception to the liability of en occupier of lend, under the rule in Rylands -v- Fletcher ocoure when the damege has been caused by the act of on unauthorised stranger.
Under the Bill the motorist defendant is, indeed, given the right to claim an indemnity from auch a person.     But the right to claim an indemnity is a very different thing from a discharge of liability.      The motorist by law must be insured and his Insurers ere to be liable in the first place.      The third party may be a man of no substance in which cose the insurers have to pay and have no effective redress.      It seem a safer to stick to the old rule that liability for damages attaches to him who is at fault.It io hardly within my province to consider anything but the legal aspect of the Bill j but I may: perhaps be permitted to suggest that it is important to look at the Bill from the point of view of the number of road accidents and whether the proposed changes would tend to increase or diminish thesec     It is more important that there should be fewer accidents than that every case should be adeq.uately compensated.The present law imposes a certain stigma upon the erring motorist.     Hs*is    found guilty of negligence - or &quot;to blame&quot;, before and in addition to liability for damages^      If the Bill were passed, no such stigma would necessarily attach to the h^ePendari-i     No investigation of responsibility for the accident would take plaoe in the great majority of cases:    I cannot think that this would be conducive to more careful drivings    I therefore think there are sound psychological grounds for leaving negligence as the basis of liability.Similar considerations apply to the proposed changes in the law as regards contributory negligence.      In aotual running-down practice, this plea never succeeds unless the Plaintiff&apos;s negligence Is cf such a gross kind that you can say that the accident was solely caused by the Plaintiffs negligence.      In other aotlons of negligence, the present rule works well and
2f **there seems no adequate result to bo gained by-diXferentd^tdjag between motor cases and. others.      The principle that a man should not claim for results which his own misconduct has helped to bring about seems to me morally sound.Under the Bill the present rule as to contributory negligence would apply to a collision between a motorist and another, such as a motor cyclist and another motor cyclist and a motor car, but it would not apply to one between a pedal cyclist and a motor car owner.      It is hard to see any valid reason for this differentiation, granted that each party is equally negligent.The V/orkman&apos;s Compensation Act imposes liability without proof of tort, but there is, in the cases covered by that Act, a special relationship between the Claimant and Respondent which does not subsist between a motorist and a chance pedestrian.      There is also, under that Act, a statutory maximum of eompensation.The Air Navigation Act, 1920, So9(l) Imposes liability for damagas, without proof of tort, upon the owner of an aircraft which caiises material damage in flight, landing or tak-&apos; ing off or  by reason of anything dropped from the aircraft. This does not seem at all comparable to the liability sought to be imposed on drivers of vehicles on the highway.     An aircraft causing such damage is like the barrel which rolled out of the window in Byrne -v- Bpadie (1663) 2 H. &amp; C. 722.      It is presumed to be under the control of the person owning it an&amp; res ipsa loquitur.      Contrast with this the oonsiderations applicable to traffic on the highways as described by
1^2j^,  to&apos;   Jt*Fletcher - lioulton L,J.  in Ving -v - London General Omnibus Company,  (1309) 2 K.B. 652 at the bottom of p. 663 and top ofPs6b2feIt should also tie noted that the Air Navigation Act, 1320, allows the defence of contributory negligence to the airman defendant which this Bill seeks to take away from the motorist defendant,I have no separate comments to make on Clauses 2 and 3 except that it does not seem desirable to extend the principle of liability without proof of negligence.Clause ij. hits at a practice common to running-own solicitors.      I have a good deal of sympathy with this proposal but the drafting will require more consideration and it may prove impracticable to find satisfactory words to prevent objectionable practices while not forbidding perfectly proper a r rang emen t s.Note.       There are two reported cases which deal with a law requiring a defendant to prove himself not guilty of negligence: one is a Canadian case in the Privy Council where it was held that the on.35  remains on the defendant to the end and doesuot shift after the Defendant has given prime facie evidence negativing his negligence:    aee Winnipeg Electric Railway -v- Geel (1952) A.0.630.      The opposite view wes taken on a similar law in Meseachusaetes &amp;e&amp; Mohoney -v- Boston Elevated Railway (ly^l) 271 Mssas  27if.      These two cases are discussed in an article in the Law Times     February 11th &apos;L*jYj Vol: 175 pdOp written by the draftsman of Lord Denes-fort&apos;s Bill.
tlHTOR AlvuTIVD2v ENTa OF PART II OP THE ROAD TRAFFIC ACT. 1950.I think the suggestion mentioned &quot;by the Minister of Transport Is excellent.      There is a good deal of injustice caused &quot;by the operation of the maxim actio personalia moritor cum persona.     No real.injustice vvould be caused by its abrogation in the direction indicated.      The insurance company has received the premiums ana there seems little reason why it should be released from its obligation because its insured is killed.      Insurance is now compulsory.      It means, of course, an added risk to the insurance companies and, perhaps, Increased premiums, but I see no reason to doubt that the proposal would now be a step forward which it would be safe to teke*(Intd) T.V/.H.I.
