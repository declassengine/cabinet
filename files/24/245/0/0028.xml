DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)R E T.CP.   507 (55),C A B I N E T.MATRIMONIAL CAUSES BILLCOPY HO.        J JHemoran&amp;nm by the Lord Chancellor.I shall he glad to know the views of my colleagues on the attitude which should he adopted by the Government towards the new Matrimonial Causes Bill introduced by Mr. Holford Knight.   (Copy attached).The Bill is based on the recommendations of the majority report of the Royal Commission.      It seeks to make many changes in divorce law, of which the two most Important are;-1.    The grounds for petitions for divorce arevery greatly extended by the addition of the following:-(1)  desertion for a period of at least three years;(2) cruelty;(5) incurablec&quot;Ihsanity where the respondent has been continuously a certified lunatic for a period of at least five years;(4) incurable habitual drunkenness where the respondent has for at least three years been separated from the petitioner in consequence of such drunkenness;(5) imprisonment under a commuted death sentence.2.    New grounds are laid down for a declarationof nullity.      A marriage shall be voidable on the ground(l) that the marriage has not been consummated owing to the wilful refusal of the respondent to consummate the marriage;    or(2) that either party to the marriage was at the  time of the marriage of unsound mind or in a state of mental unsoundness which has become definite within six months of the marriage, or was ax the time of the marriage subject&apos;to recurrent fits of insanity or epilepsy;    or -1-&apos; :
(3) that the respondent was at the time * - ^   1of the marriage suffering from venereal disease i&apos;n a communicable form;    or(4.) that the respondent was at the time of the marriage pregnant by some person other than the petitioner.The recent history of this much disputed subject is as follows.1.    In 1920 Lord Buckmaster introduced a Bill on lines similar to those of the present Bill.      It went through Committee of the House of Lords and was passed and sent to the Commons, but got no further.2.    A Bill was passed in 1923 which provided that the grounds for divorce should be the same for women as for men.3.    In 1924 Lord Buckmaster introduced another Bill, which was an exact reproduction of his Bill of 1920. It was read a second time in the House of Lords, but got no further.4.    In 1930 Mr.  Holford Knight attempted to bring in a Bill, but leave to introduce it was refused.5.    In March 1931 Mr. Ede introduced, in the House of Commons, a Bill of which the main principles were the same as the present Bill.      It was blocked.6.    In November 1932 Mr.  Holford Knight introduced a Bill making insanity a ground for divorce.      It was read a first time, but the House was twice counted out on Second Reading (May 5th and May 12th,  1933).(Initialled) S.House of Lords,15th December, 1933.
Matrimonial Causes Bill.MEMORANDUM.This Bill is based on the recommendations of the Majority Report of the Royal Commission on Divorce and Matrimonial Causes. A Bill on similar lines passed through all its stages in the Lords in 1920. While, however, the latter Bill was, a consolidation Bill, the present Bill is limited as far as possible to the proposed changes in the law. Consolidation appears to be no longer necessary, in view of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Aot, 1925.
