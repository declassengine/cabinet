(291) (33.)CABINET.Disarmament Conference, 1932.MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE.The German Disarmament Proposals : Technical Aspect.Report.1,: TO assist us in our examination of Herr Hitler&apos;s latest proposals we invited a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence :.-&apos;(l) To prepare a commentary on the German proposals, about disarmament Trom the point of view of their effect on German armaments.; :       ,v ,-,(2) To consider what stipulations would be necessary from the point of view of the United Kingdom. \2. The Sub-Committee submitted the attached Report, the conclusions of which are summed up in the following terms : &quot; The Effect of the Proposals on German Armaments. ,  .: ,(1) As already indicated, Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals will vary in effect according to the way in which they are worked. They are susceptible of being implemented in such manner as to produce within a.few years a formidable navy, army and air force, amounting to a substantial instalment of the complete rearmament of Germany. Without some rearmament beyond these proposals, however, Germany&apos;s strength would not be sufficient to justify her in undertaking a war on both her eastern and western fronts simultaneously. But under these proposals, without additional rearmament, provided she was sure of the non-intervention of the Great Powers of Western Europe, Germany would be strong enough to obtain by force, or by threat of force, a ; ;- rectification of her eastern frontier at the expense of Poland and Czecho-slovakia, and so to realise a substantial part of Hitler&apos;s declared programme of getting rid of the Treaty of Versailles.(2) Nevertheless, we believe that these proposals, formidable as they are, are preferable to immediate unrestricted rearmament, for the reason that they would leave to the heavily-armed Powers their present advantage in the possession of the so-called .&quot; offensive &quot; weapons. This advantage, however, will only be of temporary value, since by the end of the period of five to eight years&apos;, to which Herr Hitler&apos;s proposal applies, some of these types of weapons will have become obsolete or unserviceableStipulations from the Point of View of the United Kingdom.(3) In view of the extent to which the strength of our Forces has already .been reduced during recent years, while that of other countries has been increased, we must avoid the acceptance of any standstill,agreement.   Tftn? applies to all three Services. [9376]
2(4) We should urge on Germany to undertake no capital ship construc-tion pending the results of the Naval Conference in 1935; and if it is impossible to get agreement to abolish the submarine, we should try and , . induce the German Government to accept a unit limitation of 250 tons.&quot;- Our own comment on these conclusions is as follows :-The Effect of the Proposals on German Armaments.3. We accept the technical views put forward in Conclusion (I), and from a political point of view we think there is considerable danger of Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals being implemented in practice in the manner suggested therein. We are particularly impressed with the evidence in the Report of the amount of rearmament which Germany has apparently already completed or has in contem-contemplation. Herr Hitler&apos;s contention&apos;that the armaments he claims are of a &quot; non-offensive &quot; character can only be accepted in so far as it applies to Germany&apos;s western frontier. Six-ton tanks and 155 mm. guns may not be offensive weapons against the French frontier fortifications, but are capable of being used offensively against Poland and Czechoslovakia, where there are no frontier fortifications and the whole terrain is favourable to open warfare. There is some foundation for a belief that is widely held that Herr Hitler&apos;s policy is to drive a wedge between France and Ler allies and to lull France into a sense of security so as to enable Germany, if she wishes, to operate against Poland and Czechoslovakia unhampered by any difficulties on her western borders. The recent statements and actions of Herr Hitler are not inconsistent with this view. He is professing a strong desire for a Franco-German rapprochement, and he has been in close touch with Poland with a view to reaching a No Resort to Force Pact. The significance of this is that, however far German-Polish consultations have gone, they have so far been carried on without any consultation with France. Herr Hitler has also said that he would in no circumstances consent to return to the League of Nations unless the Covenant of the League was drastically revised. We hesitate, at this stage, to be dogmatic, but the indications we have given above are not inconsistent with the view that Herr Hitler is making preliminary moves on the chess-board of Europe so as to isolate from one another France and her Allies.4. Turning to Conclusion (2), even if, as the Technical Committee hold, the German proposals are preferable to immediate rearmament, we do not consider that they should be regarded as the only alternative. There may be a middle course, which might lead to a measure of regulated armaments on a lower scale. We recommend, therefore, that an attempt should be made to obtain a reduction in the German proposals, e.g., for a force nearer to that proposed in the British Draft Convention in return for a quid pro quo from France and Italy which might take the form of a reduction in the numbers, and possibly types, of their more highly offensive weapons; that is to say, guns of over a given calibre and tanks of over a given weight. We are hardly in a position at present to say whether such a proposal would have any definite chance of success, but we should be very reluctant to recommend unqualified acceptance of the present proposal. It must be remembered that the German proposal is designed for a period of from five to eight years, and after that it is quite possible she may claim to advance to the position of unlimited rearmament.Stipulations from the Point of View of the United Kingdom.5. Conclusion (3) of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report indicated that we ought not to accept any standstill agreement in view of the fact that our Defence Services have been reduced to the edge of risk. We endorse this opinion, but from information we have now received we understand that, in recommending a standstill agreement for the heavily-armed Powers, Germany intended to exclude this country. So far as we are concerned, therefore, this question does not arise provided that the German view is acceptable to other Powers. A question arises, however, as to whether France,: Italy, Poland and Czechoslovakia would te willing to accept an agreement which envisages an increase in German -
3armaments, accompanied by a &quot;standstillagreement for her neighbours: It is not unlikely, we-think, that France might claim the right to increase her armaments, and Belgium could hardly; afford a &quot; standstill&quot; agreement which left her system of frontier fortification still far from complete. It has to be remembered also that a &quot;standstill&quot; agreement applying to Germany on the basis of her present offer would virtually be equivalent to enabling her to complete the first stages of her rearmament, while holding other Powers at a level to which Germany would be working. , ,   :y\6. In spite of these difficulties, we think an attempt should be made to secure a standstill agreement, and, in particular, we consider it of vital importance to do our utmost to secure, by agreement, that the heavily-armed States, at any rate, do not increase their armaments. In fact, we think that any standstill agreement ought to be negotiated on the basis of the reduced armaments referred to in paragraph 4, and should, in no ease, be made contingent on additions to any of the forces concerned.7.   We accept the fourth Conclusion, which calls for no comment.Summary of Conclusions. 8.   Our Conclusions may be summarised as follows : (a) We think it very probable that Germany intends to rearm and is taking steps to do so. While the German proposals will not provide arma-ments that could be used offensively, against the strongly-defended frontiers of France, they are capable of such use against Poland and Czechoslovakia. If Herr Hitler&apos;s policy is one of expansion to the East, he may be in a position to implement this policy by force or threat of force when his present proposals are fulfilled in about five years&apos; time, provided he can rely on no interference by the Western Powers.(&amp;) We recommend that efforts should be made to secure a reduction in the scale of armaments involved in the German proposals, which otherwise would lead to a substantial measure of German rearmament during-the next five years. We think a middle course between the German proposals and unrestricted rearmament might be found in a reduction of the effective strength of 300,000 men, proposed by Herr. Hitler, in order to bring it nearer to the figure of 200,000 men proposed in the British Draft Convention, in return for a reduction by France and Italy in certain of their more offensive weapons, e.g., guns of over a. certain calibre and tanks of over a certain weight.(c) We accept the view of the Technical Committee that we must avoid theacceptance by this country of any standstill agreement. We have now learned, however, that the German proposal was not intended to apply to this country, and it is therefore necessary only to consider this question in its relation to the other Powers concerned. We think that. &quot;considerable difficulty may be encountered on this point, and we recommend that any standstill agreement should be negotiated with reference to the reduced basis of armaments that we have suggested in Conclusion (b) above. It is of vital importance to secure, by agree-ment, that the heavily-armed States, at any rate, do not increase their armaments.(d) We accept the conclusion that every effort should be made to persuadeGermany to undertake no capital ship construction pending the results of the Naval Conference in 1935, and that if no agreement to abolish the submarine is possible, then we should endeavour to get Germany to agree not to construct any submarines of a unit tonnage above 250 tons.9. Ttmust be borne in mind that the terms of reference to the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence limited their consideration of the problem strictly to the armaments side of the question.   It is very important
4in this matter to consider whether the best armaments agreement could not bo served by association with political agreements, covering, a wider field. This aspect of the question of Disarmament is included in a separate Memorandum in which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs sets forth the action taken as. the result of our deliberations (CP. 294 (33)). .J.

SECRET.TD.ti.C.&apos; 5.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.      -Defence! Requirements  Sub-Committee. ;GERMAN DISARMAMENT PROPOSALS.REPORT..,&apos;:- V.&apos;,..&quot;/.   &apos;1. WE* were requested to submit a Report for the Ministerial Committee -on Disarmament on the following points :-;&quot; &quot; (1) To prepare a commentary on the German proposals about disarmament (Berlin telegrams 232, 257 and 265, and Rome telegram 320) from the point of view of their effect on German armaments:) ;&apos;&quot;: (2) What stipulations would be necessary from the point of view of the United Kingdom? &quot; -2. We wish to make clear that the information placed at our disposal in regard to the German proposals is of a very general order, and is expressed only in the vaguest terms. Consequently, our comments must be regarded as entirely provisional, and in some particulars, also conjectural. We understand that steps are being taken to obtain further information and we would like to emphasise how important this is, if we are to appreciate accurately the situation.German Rearmament Proposals. ,, .,,3. The statement which Herr Hitler gave recently tO; the British Ambassador in Berlin (Berlin telegrams Nos. 232 of 24.10.33 and 82&apos;of 9.11.33), indicating the. armaments with which Germany : would be content if there was no disarmament&apos; 6f; other highly-armed ^States, . and ;the expansion and clarification of this statement by General Goering (Rome telegram No. 323 of 9.11.33, F.O. Paper W. 13075/40/98 of 15.11.33), the German Air Minister, and General von Blomberg (Berlin telegram 265 of 21.11.33), the Defence Minister, may be summarised as follows : (a) The &quot; highly-armed Powers&apos;&apos; to retain their existing armaments and establishments, but all signatories to bind themselves to ho increase for five to eight years.ip) Germany to have an Army of 300,000 on a basis of one year&apos;s service (as in France) with the armaments necessary for such a force on the French scale, but without heavy tanks and guns.       &apos;&apos;:(c) Germany to have only the &quot; defensive &quot; arms, i.e., Tanks not exceeding6 tons, guns and howitzers not exceeding 155 mm.(d) Germany to have an air force of all types, other than bombers, equal to&quot;a modest percentage&quot; of the combined fleets of the same types in France, Belgium, Poland and Czechoslovakia. The latest report suggests that only fighter aircraft are required. ,:;!.;* The composition and terms of reference of the Oomnuttee are contained,in Appendix IV.[9331] b
(e) The use of gas and bombing behind the battle zone to be prohibited for allPowers.   A later proposal suggests instead the prohibition of the bombardment of civil populations. (/) Germany would on these terms accept &quot;general supervision,&quot; but would prefer an exchange of officers with the French Army. (g) Germany would require a few small submarines for defensive purposes and a few battleships over 10,000 tons.Part I. Military Implications of the German Rearmament Proposals.4. In the succeeding paragraphs the effect of the German proposals on the military position of Germany is considered in some detail, and is examined from several angles. This course has been adopted in view of the lack of detailed information as to exactly what the Germans themselves envisage.5. One point is not yet clear in these proposals. Does the figure of 300,000 stand for &apos;&apos; average daily effectives &apos;&apos; or for &apos;&apos; establishments &apos;&apos; ? Since &apos;&apos; average daily effectives &apos;&apos; is the usual criterion, and since this gives the larger establishment, it is probable that Germany would claim this interpretation. After applying an allowance of 5 per cent, for men sick, on leave, &amp;c, 300,000 average daily effectives corresponds to an establishment of 300,000 of all ranks and in addition 15,000 average daily effectives, which would cover the calling up of reservists for training,* &amp;c.No reduction from Army establishments has been made in this calculation to allow, for armed police, since it is certain that Herr Hitler would not have envisaged their inclusion.v.. Basing calculations on the French Army in France (exclusive of Colonial troops), with its average daily effectives of approximately 240,000, the establish--meht of 300,000 of all ranks might include the following categories :  24,000 officers.76,000 n.c.os. and other long-service personnel. 200,000 conscripts.But ;these figures could be varied, without affecting the total of daily effectives, to increase the long-service personnel-required, for example, for tank units at the expense of the establishment of short-service personnel.6. It is difficult to estimate the number of Divisions which would be represented by the above establishment. This must depend on the proportion of peace to war establishments, on the number and strength of units, e.g., tank units, outside the divisional organisation, &amp;c. On the analogy of the 5 Cavalry and 20 Infantry Divisions of the French Army, the establishment proposed might represent a peace strength of 5 Cavalry Divisions and 25 to 30 Infantry Divisions, and an initial war expansion to 50 to 60 Infantry Divisions.7. The above establishment would leave as surplus to requirements of the annual conscript contingent of 200,000 approximately the following number of youths in the &quot; annual classes&quot; : t1934     ... ... ...      329,0001935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942318,000199,000 ] 97,000   Lean  years 67,000 Y    due to 76,000 I Great War.207,000 343,000 325,000It would remain to be seen whether Germany would not, by giving these some pre-military training in the &apos;&apos; Hitler Jugend &apos;&apos; and in the compulsory labour camps, effectively add to her category of reservists and frontier defence forces.8. It will be seen that the German proposals involve the creation of a great army, but that they still leave France with the advantage of her fortified frontier* Equivalent to an annual training for three weeks of some 220,000 reservists, t These figures do not include the population of the Saar area.
and of her mass of heavy artillery and a few heavy tanks. In this sense the new proposals are definitely more favourable for France than unrestricted rearmament on the part of Germany. Nor would the Gei-man army, so formed, armed only as it would be with the so-called defensive weapons, be capable of undertaking a war against France and Poland combined with any certainty of success. On the other hand, it might be sufficient to give Germany a sense of security and to remove any incentive to other Powers to attack her.9. Herr Hitler has, however, been making great efforts to compose Germany&apos;s differences with France and to convince her of Germany&apos;s pacific intentions towards her. Were Herr Hitler to succeed in this and to detach France from her alliances with Poland and Czechoslovakia, the army and air force now proposed for Germany should be sufficient to defeat the Polish army, or even the Polish and Czechoslovak armies combined. The Polish-German frontier is long and open, and the factor of chief importance will be the character of the combatants, which should weigh the balance in Germany&apos;s favour. The Polish army is itself almost wholly deficient in the &quot;offensive&quot; weapons, and for this problem Germany does not need the heavier tanks and ordnance.The Czechoslovak Army is for various reasons not of marked value for an offensive against Germany, and should not suffice in conjunction with Poland to turn the scale against her.10. It remains to compare the army now proposed by Germany with that proposed in the British Draft Convention of March 1933. The comparison cannot be definite, since a number of points, such as the inclusion or exclusion of armed police in the average daily effectives, have not been dealt with. The Draft Convention proposes for Germany an army of 200,000 average daily effectives based on a maximum of eight months total training, inclusive of reserve training. On this basis the establishment of the German army might have been : 20,000 officers.70,000 n.c.o&apos;s. and other long-service personnel. 100,000 conscripts.Assuming only a six months&apos; period of service with the Colours, which the Germans are understood to consider sufficient, this establishment would deal with an annual turnover of 200,000 conscripts, a number equal to that turned over by the establishment now proposed. It follows that the total trained reserves at any given time could be the same under both proposals.The difference between the two systems would lie in the lower standard of training in the Convention army and in the lower peace establishment making mobilisation rather more difficult. The Convention army could mobilise a number of divisions equal to that under the new German proposal. It would, therefore, require a number of weapons for the equipment of the mobilised army, equal to that which will be demanded under the new proposals.&quot; &apos; - 11. France and Poland should favour the new German proposals more than those laid down in the Draft Convention; since, while by the latter both France and Poland were definitely limited in their number and equipment, under the present suggestion they are left with their armies as they are at present, and, in actual fact, are faced with no greater liability than.under the British Draft Convention.Hence one can understand the statement of General von Blomberg to our Ambassador in Berlin that Germany would still prefer all-round disarmament to her present suggestion, and that of General Weygand to our Military Attache in Paris that for France he would prefer German rearmament to French disarmament.12. In addition to any military forces which Germany might acquire, either with or without permission, account must always be taken of the unauthorised forces which, according to present information, should be some 1^ million, and, also the very important questions of stocks of war material, manufacture of war material and plans for industrial mobilisation.13.   We might, perhaps, add to this military section of the Report, before passing on to the air and naval&apos;.sections, that we are of the opinion that, so far [9331] &apos; B 2
as. man. power-alone is, concerned,.&apos; the forces which Germany could eventually mobilise are almost unlimited, and that she is much better placed than any other European country in this particular respect. This. being. so, the problem of German rearmament resolves itself mainly into a question of the supply of the necessary armaments to enable&apos; such -mail power as she may intend to mobilise to be fit for war. In this connection, it must be remembered that her industrial mobilisation capacity is of a very high order.   (See also paragraph 40.)V.-14. To avoid overloading ,,the Report itself... with, too much detail we have included in Appendix I a summary of the present state of German preparations for military ;rearmament.. In addition, we attach, an account by General. Edmonds, the author Qi the Official Military History of the War on the. Western Front, of the reorganisation of the Prussian Army after the Peace of Tilsit, which is of some interest in connection with present developments. V&apos; Air Implications^ of the German Rearmament Proposals.      ,-..15. Toe telegrams referred to contain no reference to any direct claim by the.. Germans to have military. aircraft,    v.  \\  &apos;;  \ ;&apos; - ------- v16. It can be inferred, however, from the penultimate: ^sentence, of: Berlin telegram No. 232, that, the Germans intend to claim military aircraft on the ground that they are &quot;defensive weapons necessary for &quot;the army. ,&quot; - 17. If this claim is conceded, the next step-may well be that Germany will make the; size! of her army the, yards tick for measuring the air force-she. is to be allowed. i&apos; i&quot;1 - .   v   - 1 r .   --- - :-[f-\V^.: If the continental army is to be. the yardstick of the continental air f6fce,and;if Germany is granted an army of 300,000 men, she will be able to make a case for about 700 military aircraft in first line on the present French ratio of air force (less &quot;bombers&quot;) to army. .19. An alternative to1 measuring Gerhlahy&apos;s&apos; future air force&apos;by the size of her army has been attributed to General Goering.&apos; He is reported to have proposed to measure it,,by,.adding- up the-; total air;, forces of France, Poland, Belgium and Czechoslovakia, deducting the aircraft now designated as &quot;bombers &quot; and allowing Germany a &quot;modest percentage &quot; of the remainder. If/33 pef: cent can be called &quot; modest,&quot; Germany, would thus obtain about 730 military first-line aircraft. It is necessary to observe that. this unusual and conveniently elastic method of calculating a nation!s requirements, in aircraft is apparently a product of the German Air Ministry and we have seen no evidence that the Government.have adopted it. The result, however, would not.be very different from that, refer red to in paragraph 18. above: -&quot;&apos; 20. As it is impossible to devise restrictions which would prevent the use of any military aircraft for bombing purposes, every military aeroplane obtained by Germany1 would be apatential bomber. That is to say, by representing certain types of military aircraft as purely defensive,- Germany would be able to make a case for a force 30 per cent., more numerous than, the British metropolitan air force at the present time (excluding Fleet Air Arm) and could equip, this force with aircraft identical in striking power with those now used in our day-bombing squadrons.&apos;     (Note.---Our present strength is as follows:--: &apos;     j \- ,     H.D. Force (including A.A.F. and S.R.) ,476Army Co-operation ... ... ...        60Flying Boats     ... ... ... ...        15  .....&apos;       .        Total      ... .......    , . -551)21.   From the above&apos; it seems obvious that in dealing with the German proposals His Majesty&apos;s Government ought, at all costs, to avoid acceptance of any German thesis that aircraft of; a purely nqn-offensive type exist or can be produced, and that the numbers of such aircraft&apos;should be fixed in relation to the strengths^of-armies,^ ;\ . . ...... . L    ..,     .;&apos;&apos;- &apos; It has-already, been agreed by the Air Commission at.Geneva that all aircraft are potentially offensive (without prejudice to the question of their, use for
defensive purposes), and it is scarcely necessary to draw further attention to the risk this country would run if the size of air forces is to be regulated by the size -of armies.  (See CP. 164 (32), page 5, paragraph 13.) &apos; - -22. If.the. conjecture that Germany is going to demand some 700 aircraft is correct, we understand/ provided the money is available, that there is no reason-why this number of machines should not be constructed in five years and sufficient, pilots and mechanics trained,,to man this air force in a similar time.23. We also understand, in addition, that Germany has now some 234; aircraft, consisting of fighters, bombers and reconnaissance machines.&apos; In addition, 65 of the same types are under construction. In Appendices III and XIIa is included a note by the Air Ministry on the German Aircraft and Preparations. &apos;   -24. We are of the opinion that there is very little difference in the German proposals between limited and unlimited rearmament, except that under, the German scheme official bombing aircraft would not be allowed. This is a stipulation, however, to which it wOuld be unwise to attach too much importance for reasons that have already been stated.Naval Implications of the German Rearmament Proposals.- 25. The naval proposals are even vaguer than the military and air proposals, but.it.would seem that Germany is aiming at obtaining release from Part V of the Treaty of. Versailles in .respect of submarines and the present limiting size of capital ships. &apos; &apos;        r  ,,. -     ;   ,       ,        .26. The German proposal actually talks about a few quite small submarines and a few battleships over 10,000 tons.        :--&quot;&quot;.. 27... In&apos; the. British, disarmament proposals of the 16th March, 1933, the line was taken that France, Italy and Germany should not be permitted, to begin any new construction except within well defined limits! &apos;.&apos;. , &apos; :28. The.amendments proposed by Germany to the British proposals stated that until the 31st December, 1936, Germany would undertake :- ,  .    . .. (a) Not to exceed, as regards surface vessels, the numbers hitherto assigned/      to her as a limit..        &apos; -        &apos; , &quot;&apos; &apos;(b) Not to lay down the keel of more than one vessel to replace one of her capital ships which are obsolete.The Admiralty have no details at all of the size of the ship which Germany has; in mind, but suggest, tentatively, that it might be a vessel of 15,000 to 17,000 tons; at any rate, it is assumed that it would be larger than the presentpeutschland class. &apos; :&apos; ?29. The.situation in regard to the future size of the capital ship is extremely uncertain. We,ourselves have put forward proposals for a capital ship of either 25,000 with 12-inch guns,/or 22,000 tons with 11-inch guns, but at present.we have no idea whether this size ship will be acceptable to the other naval Powers concerned. This being so, it is regarded as of great importance by the Admiralty that Germany should, if possible, be dissuaded from any new construction until this question of the future size of the capital ship can be settled (see also paragraphs 49 -50).30. As regards submarines, the Admiralty tell us, although at present they have no detailed knowledge, that they suspect Germany will ask for submarines of 400 to 500 tons. Vessels of this size have always been regarded, by us as being -capable of use for offensive purposes, and so far as Germany is concerned, if she possessed vessels of this size she would be able to operate them at the mouth of the English.Channel.  We return to this question in Part II, paragraph. 52.Conclusions.&apos;31.&quot; As already indicated, Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals will vary, in effect according to the way in which they are worked.. They are susceptible of being implemented in such manner as to produce within a few years a formidable navy,
army and. air force, amounting to a substantial instalment of the complete rearmament of Germany. Without some rearmament beyond these proposals however, Germany&apos;s strength would not be sufficient to justify her in undertaking a war on both her eastern and western fronts simultaneously. But under these proposals, without additional rearmament, provided she was sure of the non-intervention of the Great Powers of Western Europe, Germany would be strong enough to obtain by force, or by threat of force, a rectification of her eastern frontier at the expense of Poland and Czechoslovakia, and so to realise a substantial part of Hitler&apos;s declared programme of getting rid of the Treaty of Versailles.Nevertheless we believe that these proposals, formidable as they are, are preferable to immediate, unrestricted rearmament for the reason that they would leave to the heavily armed Powers their present advantage in the possession of the so-called &quot;offensive&quot; weapons. This advantage, however, will only be of temporary value, since, by the end of the period of five to eight years to which Herr Hitler&apos;s proposal applies, some of these types of weapons will have become obsolete or unserviceable.Part II. Stipulations from the Point of View of the United Kingdom.32. In commenting on our interpretation of the German proposals as they might affect our own defence situation and future preparations, we would point out that we are already engaged in the preliminary stages of an inquiry into our defence requirements. Until this inquiry is completed we are only in a position to give provisionally our general impressions as to any possible reactions of the German proposals vis-a-vis our own position.Standstill Agreement.33. There is one aspect of the German proposals which is common both to the Army and Air Force and, in one respect, to the Navy -as it may affect the Fleet Air Arm. This is the proposal for what is called a &quot; Standstill Agreement.&quot;34. There seems to be some doubt as to whether the Standstill proposal is intended to apply to this country. As received, it reads as follows : &quot; France, Poland, Czecho-Slovakia and other States would retain their present number of effectives and present offensive weapons, but be limited to the present numbers of both.&quot;35. In view of General von Blomberg&apos;s statement to Sir Eric Phipps that &apos;&apos; England had perhaps disarmed more than necessary &apos;&apos; it might be inferred that the intention was to exclude the United Kingdom. This is rather confirmed in the following telegram which has just been received from Berlin (No. 269 of 27/11/33) in which Baron von Neurath confirmed to Sir Eric Phipps &quot;that standstill arrangement is not meant to apply to Great Britain but only to &apos; heavily armed States.&apos; &quot; We think it advisable, however, to state categorically that we could in no circumstances accept any such Standstill Agreement.36. Owing to the fact that we have unilaterally disarmed over a period of years when other States, even if they have not actively rearmed, have taken steps to equip their existing forces in all respects in accordance with their requirements, we have allowed the position of our Defence Forces, in respect of both personnel and material, to sink to the edge of risk.37. For this reason we feel we must reserve to ourselves the right to put our house in order, and the steps necessary to this end are likely, in comparison with the preparations made in other countries and the proposals put forward by Germany, to be of a modest character.38. So far as our military forces are concerned, some steps will have to be taken to make effective what we actually possess. This will mean some increase in personnel, and most certainly in material.39, We have shown in the first part of this Report that the German proposal for 300,000 men with unlimited equipment might mean that, in due course, Germany could put into the field 50-60 divisions.  At the present moment, we are
only capable of placing in the field 5 divisions in six months. The discrepancy is so wide that we can hardly bind ourselves not to make efficient what little we have, and, in case the Germans should expand on any such scale, we ought to preserve the right even to increase our available military forces.40. It should be noted that while Germany has greater facilities for developing her industrial mobilisation, yet France&apos;s initial capacity for pro-duction at present is greater than Germany&apos;s, owing to her having kept up her wartime shops, &amp;c. Once Germany&apos;s industrial organisation is mobilised she will outstrip France.41. There is also the question of keeping up the strength of our home and overseas garrisons. At the present time, owing to the economies which we have effected in our military services, the situation in this respect is not satisfactory, and it is, in our opinion, essential that we should take steps to make good deficiencies, not only at home, but in the garrisons overseas, with as little delay as possible.42. It is because our organisation is based on such a limited number of effectives that we have adopted a policy of mechanisation. This provides an additional reason why, if we are to maintain our small force in anything like its proper state of efficiency, we cannot bind ourselves not to construct any more tanks or to bring our equipment up to date in many other directions.43. As regards the air, we have always stipulated that we should reserve the right to build up to parity with the strongest air Power, even though we might not desire to exercise this right.44.   It will be recalled that in the draft Disarmament Convention put forward by the United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva on the 16th March, 1933, : an attempt was made to achieve parity by the reduction of the strongest air forces down to 500 aircraft each.   If we cannot achieve it in this way, we must, nevertheless, retain the right to parity by a process of building up.45. There is also another and very important side of the question of air parity, and this concerns the strength of the Fleet Air Arm. At the present moment, we are 47 aircraft below the full complement of existing ships, and our total Fleet Air Arm strength is 159. Japan has at present 217 fleet aircraft, with a programme of 96 additional already authorised, and the possibility of the construction of a further 255 in the future. The United States possess 475 fleet aircraft; under the industrial recovery programme another 194 have been authorised, and it is believed that a further 117 may be approved.46, In connection with the figure of 500 aircraft included in the British Dra,ft Convention, this question of aircraft for the fleet was never discussed. To include fleet aircraft in the total of 500 would bind us to a reduction in the numbers of aircraft available, both for Home Defence and to assist in the defence -of overseas territories. This is a point which has long been in our minds, and we feel that this is, perhaps, a favourable opportunity to again draw attention to it.47. In view of the extremely uncertain situation as to the future strength of air armaments, we feel it is equally impossible to accept a standstill agreement in connection with air forces, particularly since the problem of fleet aircraft has not yet been settled.48. From the point of view of the Navy, no standstill agreement would be applicable, since naval construction is limited by reason of the existing naval treaties, and the Admiralty are anxious that nothing should be done to disturb the existing agreement pending the projected Naval Conference in 1935.49. The Admiralty have before now expressed the view that there would be an advantage in permitting Germany to construct a standard type of capital ship. As a result of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany evolved a hybrid, which has re-resulted in France also constructing a vessel somewhat of this kind. The Admiralty are of the opinion that everything should be done to discourage, in future, construction of hybrid vessels. While at the present moment such types do not, we understand, cause us any particular anxiety, we might not be able to ignore
s;^.n appreciable increase in their numbers. Their characteristics are such that they are faster than vessels possessing more powerful armament, but more heavily armed than vessels of equivalent speed. A force of- such vessels, therefore, might possess great destructive potentialities on the trade routes of the Empire.50. It is at present impossible to say what, if any, agreement may be reached at or before .the 1935 Naval Conference regarding the future size of the capital ship, but, from our own point of view, we are anxious.that Germany should take no action which might tend to establish any new type of hybrid, e.g., a vessel of 15,000 to 17,000 tons. We would draw attention to the fact that, if we.were forced ultimately to take some counter-measures in respect of these vessels, it could only be done at the expense of the total tonnage at present available for the construction of capital ships.51. We would suggest, therefore, that we might urge upon Germany that it is to her advantage to hold her hand until some agreement is reached on the size of the future capital ship, in accordance with international opinion, otherwise the whole of the existing system of naval disarmament will be compromised.52. We have for some time past : advocated. the total abolition of the submarine, but, failing this, we put forward in our Draft Convention that the maximum unit tonnage should be fixed at 250 tons. If no agreement to abolish the submarine is possible, then the Admiralty urge that every endeavour should be made to get agreement with Germany to limit construction to this size. As already mentioned, the Admiralty have aii idea that the Germans will claim submarines of 400 to 500 tons. Such submarines will, however, be capable of operating off the mouth of the Channel, and while, in the opinion of the Naval Staff, the submarine has ceased to be such a formidable menace as it was in the last war, owing to improved methods of defence against it, we are most anxious to avoid, if in any way possible, the construction of submarines of such a type as could be employed actively in waters surrounding this country. .Conclusions.    , :  ,53. Our Conclusions as to the stipulations that would be necessary from the point of view of the United Kingdom are as follows : (a) In view of the extent to which the strength of our Forces has alreadybeen reduced during recent years while that of other countries has been increased, we must avoid the acceptance of any standstill agreement.   This applies to all three Services.(b) We should urge on Germany to undertake no capital ship constructionpending the results of the Naval Conference in 1935; and if it is impossible to get agreement to abolish the subniarine, we should try and induce the German Government to accept a unit limitation of &apos; 250 tons.       - &apos;    , &apos;     t &apos;&apos; : .SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS. 54.   Our conclusions may be summarised as followsThe Effect of the Proposals on German Armaments. 1(1) As already indicated, Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals will vary in effect according to the way in which they are worked. They are susceptible of being implemented in such manner as to produce; within a few years a formidable navy, army and air force, amounting to a substantial instalment of the complete rearmament of Germany. Without some rearmament beyond. these proposals, however, Germany&apos;s; strength would not be sufficient to justify her in undertaking a war on both her eastern and western fronts simultaneously. But under these proposals, without additional rearmament, provided she was sure of -the non-intervention of the Great Powers of Western Europe, Germany would be strong enough to obtain by force, or by threat of force, a rectification of her eastern frontier at the expense of Poland and Czechoslovakia, and so to realise a substantial part of Hitler&apos;s&apos; -   . &apos;il     declared programme of getting rid of the Treaty of Versailles.
9(2) Nevertheless, we believe that these proposals, formidable as they are, are preferable to immediate unrestricted rearmament, for the reason that they would leave to the heavily armed Powers their present advantage in the possession of the so-called &apos;&apos; offensive&apos;&apos; weapons. This advantage, however, will only be of temporary value, since by the end of the period of five to eight years, to which Herr Hitler&apos;s proposal applies, some of these types of weapons will have become obsolete or unserviceable. :&apos;&apos;Stipulations from the Point of View of the United Kingdom.(3) In view of the extent to which the strength of our forces has already been reduced during recent years, while that of other countries has been increased, we must avoid the acceptance of any standstill agreement.   This applies to all three Services.(4) We should urge on Germany to undertake no capital ship construction pending the results of the Naval Conference in 1935; and if it is impossible to get agreement to abolish the submarine, we should try and induce the German Government to accept a unit. limitation of I t i.250 tons. , -  i    ,Signed On behalf of the Sub-Committee;, M.

APPENDIX I.Summary of Present State of German Preparations for Military Rearmament.Note. No reference is made in this summary to the important advance in airarmaments.%h The Regular Forces Army and Police.APART from some minor infractions of detailed establishments laid down by the Treaty, &amp;c, no change of great military importance is reported in the Reichsheer (Regular Army). The Armed Police is receiving military training and is utilised to train men of the S.A., &amp;c, and for frontier defence. The Auxiliary Police has been absorbed or disbanded.2. The Unauthorised Forces.The Nazi S.S., S.A., Wehrstahlhelm, Labour Service and National Physical Training Organization have been welded into a uniform organization. The young men of the Stahlhelm have been absorbed into the S.A. and a further reorganization appears now to be in: progress to form: (a) An abtiVe S.A. Militia of 300,000 to provide reservists for the expansionof the Reichsheer on mobilization. These are receiving intensive training for short periods under the Reichsheer.(b) A Reserve S.A.  Militia of 400,000 receiving some training underReichsheer and Police instructors.(c) The remainder some 800,000 are receiving some training under theirown leaders.The S.S., a picked body 120,000 strong, is believed to be organized in complete military units for frontier or internal defence. S.S. and S.A. leaders are receiving training under the Reichsheer as Reserve officers.The general training of the unauthorized forces has much improved and an average of 25 per cent, are reported now to be armed.The Grenzschutz, a frontier, defence force consisting of police, ex-service men and Nazi units, are reported to be active and well-trained on the Polish frontiers, whilst some defensive works are reported. The Grenzschutz in the Rhineland appears to be rudimentary.3. Stocks of War Material.It is difficult to get an accurate idea of these, but the position is believed to be : (a) Rifles. Sufficient available for 21 divisions and for frontier defence forces.(b) Light automatics and machine guns. Probably now or will shortly besufficient for 21 Divisions and on a low scale for frontier defence forces.(c) Trench mortars. Above establishment  for the 7  Divisions of theReichsheer, and can easily be manufactured.(d) Anti-tank weapons are in possession of all Reichsheer units, and considerable numbers are under manufacture.(e) Infantry close support guns (75 m/m). The establishment is 6 perinfantry regiment, but manufacture appears only now to have begun.(f) Field Artillery. 21 Divisions with Corps and Army troops require notless than :  1,008-77 m/m. (3-inch) guns. 504 105 m/m. (4-inch) howitzers.There is no direct evidence of the extent to which these are available, but from indirect sources it is believed that the numbers will not be completed until the end of 1934.
(g) Anti-aircraft artillery. Sufficient might be available for 21 Divisions,but those available for area defence and naval bases will then be totally insufficient.(h) Medium artillery. 21 Divisions with Corps and Army troops require atleast: 168 105 m/m. guns.336 150 m/m. (5-9-inch) howitzers.It is believed that the guns might be available, but no howitzers have been reported.(i) Heavy and super-heavy artillery. Sufficient guns might be available, but ..... very few heavy howitzers.(j) Small arm ammunition. Stocks should be sufficient for 21 Divisions andfrontier defence forces, (k) Artillery ammunition. Reserves have been formed, but it is reportedthat they are insufficient for mobilization and that large orders are &quot;&apos;J now likely to be placed for manufacture. (1) Tanks. Only training and experimental machines have so far beenreported, but it is likely that arrangements exist for armouring com-mercial tractors to provide infantry support tanks of an inefficient&apos;. type-(m) Armoured cars can probably be improvised from six-wheelers. (The authorised police cars have no cross-country performance).(n) Mechanical transport. Sufficient for mobilisation would probably be available from the Nazi motor organisation and from standardised vehicles in Government and State transport concerns.  . :(o) Uniform and equipment should be sufficient.4. Manufacture of War Material.Considerable activity is reported in all branches of war material industry, but the orders reported are mainly small and in the nature of trial orders. The main gun-making firm is reported to have on order or in stock 235 field guns and howitzers, but only experimental medium howitzers have been reported. Reports have been received of orders for 340,000 rounds of shell (as against mobilisation requirements of not less than 10,000,000).An unconfirmed report gives 100 (6-ton) light tanks as on order and more orders as expected.Sums of  9,000,000 are reported to have been allotted for 1933-34, and again for 1934-35 from the &quot; programme for the provision of work for the unemployed &quot; for expenditure on munitions, mainly on artillery and ammunition.Reports of abnormal imports by Germany of raw material of munition industry have been investigated, but do not appear to afford any conclusive evidence of abnormal war munition activity.5. Industrial Mobilisation.Reports indicate that mobilisation arrangements are sufficiently advanced to maintain 21 Divisions at a low scale of armament. Mobilisation and war reserves to cover the period before mobilised industry commences mass output are, as already mentioned, believed to be insufficient.6. Chemical Warfare.Offensive and defensive experiment is active, but it is unlikely, in view of Germany&apos;s output capacity, that stocks of gas are held. Passive defence against air attack, specially against gas, is being energetically organised.7. Mobilisation Plans.It is reported that the Reichswehr Ministerium aims, as its immediate objective for the defence of the Reich, at mobilising : 3 Cavalry Divisions 1 By the expansion of the Reichsheer. 21 Infantry Divisions j   J rA large semi-trained frontier defence force.

APPENDIX II.Memorandum by General Edmonds. Prussia, in 1813.IN 1854-55 the Historical Section of the Prussian Genera! Staff published in parts a lengthy adcbunt of &quot;The Reorganization of the Prussian Army after the Peace of Tilsit &quot; ; from this, and from the &quot; History of the Prussian Army,&apos;&quot; issued by the Great General Staff in 1914, the following particulars are taken : By the Treaty of Tilsit, the land forces of Prussia were limited to 42,000, about a tenth Of what she had previously put info the field, and the formation of militia or citizen-bands and any increase of the total were specifically forbidden.The organisation which Prussia adopted was designed for rapid expansion. Six territorial divisions, or rather composite brigades (only 6,000 strong), were formed. Besides training field troops, they had also to provide fortress garrisons. Companies were reduced to 50 men each, instead of 250 (20 old soldiers. 30 recruits); cavalry squadrons to 62 (42bid soldiers, 20 recruits); the artillery regiments were reduced to single batteries.&apos; These weak units, like the &quot; Tradition Companies &quot; maintained in place Of the old regiments, in 1919, were to form the cadres&quot; on expansion. Superfluous horses were sold to farmers, &quot; not to be used for work which would unfit them.for cavalry service.&quot; In 1809, the return of Prussian prisoners of war from France furnished a precious reserve.8.&apos; Readiness for Mobilisation. J-     -iAt the present date, while trained and semi-trained personnel are available for; a, larger expansion, the lack of material would probably confine German expansion on first mobilisation to:  &apos; &apos;3 Cavalry Divisions 1 On a low scale of field artillery and with 21 Infantry Divisions J&apos;   practically no medium howitzers or tanks. A large frontier defence&apos; fbrce with a low scale of machine guns and .....     practically no artillery.     - .   :     ,Mobilisation stocks will be low and output insufficient to equip further large forces until probably five to six months after mobilisation.v By,the end of 1934 or early 1935, it is expected that the same forces could be mobilised with a normal scale of field artillery, but still weak in medium howitzers and tanks. The frontier defence forces would by &apos; that &apos;date probably be well, equipped with t machine guns,; but would still be on a very low scale of artillery. &quot;&apos;   &quot;       &apos;     &apos;9. Conclusions. &apos; &apos;i ;. It will be: seen from the, above that, although the Reichswehrmiuisterium has utilised to the utmost its, up to the present, limited resources in order to provide trained noampower and war, material, Germany should not be in a position for some time to come to mobilise and maintain ah, army either of the size or of the offensive value which would constitute; a menace to her neighbours, i&apos; &apos;. The preparations which she has made upto date can be explained by a feeling of insecurity which she must naturally feel in the presence of her highly-armed neighbours on her Eastern and. South-western frontiers. One cannot,, however, ignore the danger of the militarist spirit which the Nazi party has inculcated into her youth, or help wondering to what use they will put it defensive or offensive.; Nor can one ignore the advance in rearmament that the Germans have made in the fast few years, and the obvious&apos; steps they are taking to accelerate this advance, .which in 5: or&apos;6 years&apos; time may1 again make them a menace to. the peace of Europe, and bring their war preparations beyond the stage which can be justified by what they consider to be the needs of their own security.November 25, 1933. - , .. .
On Scharnhorst&apos;s proposal, in 1807, in the first three years 20 trained men were discharged from each company, afterwards 10, and recruits substituted for them.     ,  ; &quot;...iN ationalwaclien, that is, armed police, were instituted in 1808 for &quot; internal security &quot; in every town, a company for every 5,000 inhabitants, with a section of &quot; cavalry &quot; for small towns and country districts.Universal service was prepared for from 1808 onwards, and in the same year the raising of Volunteer Jager (riflemen) companies was suggested, and found instant application. Directly Napoleon allowed the Court to return to Berlin from Konigsberg, in December 1809, the Conscription Commission got to work to have everything ready when opportunity should come to put conscription into force. .The so-called Krumper system was founded by a Cabinet order of the 6th August, 1808. By this, every month, &quot; according to need,&quot; 3 to 5 or more trained men were dismissed from every company of infantry and artillery, and raw recruits brought in in their place; these, as soon as they had received a short training, were replaced by others. Mounted troops were allowed ten supernumeraries to train in this way, but did not dismiss their trained nucleus.The next step, in April 1809, was to keep additional men with the colours (35 per infantry company, 25 per squadron), but without pay and not on the muster roll.The recall of partly trained recruits and Krnmper for refreshing courses was begUn in 1811. They were also called up for entrenching exercises and work useful to the State.By all these measures, bn the 30th August,. 1811, the 42,000 men with the colours had grown to 74,413. An example is given of the 1st Pomeranian Infantry Regiment, which had 2,550 &quot; Regimentskrumper,&quot; of whom 611 had under six months&apos; service, and 1,388 over a year.For Officers, plenty from the old army were available.The great opportunity for expansion and for the manufacture of munitions came when, in view of the invasion of Russia, Napoleon accepted the Alliance of Prussia, and allowed her to increase her army by 28,000.In 1813, conscription was introduced, and the existing army was. organized into 3 corps of two divisions, &amp;c, each, and a fourth corps was formed, a totalof nominally 340,000 men, with reserves behind them, and the supply of weapons and ammunition assured. The Volunteer corps probably provided 80,000 more. Lutzow&apos;s corps, for instance; consisted of 6,000 infantry, in six battalions, and 600 cavalry.APPENDIX III.German Aircraft having the characteristics of Modern Military Aircraft.1. THE following is a list of German Aircraft, having the characteristics of the military types shown, which are in existence or under construction on the 28th November, 1933 :-2. It is emphasised that this list gives only the numbers which are known and, while it may not be a complete picture, it is considered to be a reasonable representation of the present situation.-(A) In existence November 28, 1933.147 Single or two-seater fighters.49 Bombers (including torpedo bombers and dive bombers). 38 General purpose or reconnaissance (potential bombers).234 Total.All the above-mentioned aircraft are considered as being owned by the Air ; Ministry.   They are not being used in commercial aviation, although some 61 have been registered.   Of those registered, 37 are employed in the Government Flying Training Schools. ,
(B) Under construction November 28, 1933.35 Single or two-seater fighters.26 Bombers (including torpedo bombers and dive bombers). 4 General purpose or reconnaissance (potential bombers).65 Total. November 28, 1933.APPENDIX IIIa.Germany.Formation of a German Air Ministry.ONE of the first acts of the German National Socialist Party on assuming power was the appointment of the prominent Nazi, Herr Goring, to a newly-created post of Reich Commissar for Aviation.Subsequently this appointment was abolished, and on the 1st May an independent Air Ministry was formed with Herr, now General, Goring as Air Minister.Since his appointment General Goring has publicly declared that his department would deal with everything pertaining to aviation. This has been fully carried out.Illegal Activities of German Air Ministry.Ostensibly the Air Ministry is concerned only with commercial and private aviation, but it is known that, in addition to these activities, it possesses an organisation somewhat similar to our own Air Ministry and which is concerned with every aspect of military aviation.Military Aircraft and Training.Germany, although forbidden military aircraft, has been constructing such types abroad for many years past, and has also been training (illegally) Naval and Military personnel at home and at a German-owned technical flying training school at Lipetsk in the U.S.S.R.Since the creation of the Air Ministry these illegal activities have been considerably increased, and not only have all types of military aircraft been constructed in series, and operated in Germany, but plans have been made for their mass production in time of war. Further, extensive training in all branches of military aviation is now being carried out at the Government-owned air stations and schools in Germany.At the present time it is estimated that over 200 aircraft, having the characteristics of modern Bomber, Torpedo-Bomber, Fighter and Reconnaissance aircraft, exist in Germany.In addition, orders which have recently been placed by the Air Ministry will mean that by the end of 1934 she will possess at least 400 military aeroplanes.Performance of Military Aircraft.In spite of the restrictions which have been placed upon the construction of military aircraft in Germany, the performance of her service aeroplanes compare favourably with those of other countries.Formation of Reserves.The whole of German sporting aviation has been brought under the control of the Air Ministry. An organisation comprising Areas, Districts, Squadrons, and Flights, is being formed, the personnel of which, wearing a uniform somewhat similar to our own, are&quot; amateurs who are prepared to submit to &quot; disciplined flying.&quot; While this organisation is still in its infancy, there is ho doubt that in a short time it will give Germany a huge reserve of flying and ground personnel. . \
German commercial aviation has, since 1926, been grouped under one head, the Deutsche Luft Hansa. France has just done the same and Italy is reported to be about to follow suit.Such centralisation of commercial air fleets increases their value to the State as a potential bombing force, and in this respect it may be said that Germany is well ahead of other European nations.Air Defence.Active measures to prepare the country against air attack are being carried out, bomb and gas proof shelters are being constructed and a vast organisation which embraces every aspect of passive air defence is in the process of being formed.Conclusion.It will be seen therefore that, by the construction of military aircraft, the training of service personnel and the building up of a strong reserve of amateur pilots, steps have already been taken towards the creation of a German Air Force.APPENDIX IV.Defence Requirements Sub-Committee.
