DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1933.SECRET. Copy No.30CP. 289 (33).55CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE PRIVATE ARMAMENTS INDUSTRY.REPORT.AT their meeting on the 12th April, 1933 (Cabinet 27 (33), Conclusion 6), the Cabinet had before them two memoranda (Papers Nos. CP. 94 (33) and OP. 99 (33) on the Position of the Private Armaments Industry in Imperial Defence, and agreed that a Committee composed as follows The President of the Board of Trade (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for Air,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade,should meet to consider what action can be taken to remove the handicaps which are alleged to exist on the manufacture and export of armaments, including warships and aircraft, in Great Britain, and thus to place British manufacturers, including shipyards, on equal terms with their competitors in. other countries, so long as there is no effective international agreement on the subject.2. In addition to the documents which were before the meeting of the Cabinet on the 12th April last, we have had before us a Report by a Sub-Committee of the Principal Supply Officers Committee on the System of Licensing Exports of Arms and Ammunition, which Report has received the approval of the Principal Supply Officers Committee, a letter dated the 20th July, 1933, from the Foreign Office on the recommendations contained in the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report, and a Note by the President of the Board of Trade on the Export Licensing System and Export Credit Facilities for munitions of war in foreign countries. These three documents are annexed to this Report as Appendices I, II and III, respectively.3. We are in complete agreement with the Conclusions of the Principal Supply Officers Committee, which are summarised on page 8 of their Report, (see CP. 94 (33) ) as follows :-&apos;&apos; (i) We have pointed out that it is on our armaments industry that we must rely to bridge the gap between the outbreak of war and the time when peace industry can be turned over to war production. A stable armaments industry, which maintains an adequate output of naval craft and war-like stores as part of its normal peace-time activities, is essential to our scheme of Imperial defence.(ii) The present-day capacities of the armaments and shipbuilding industries are markedly inferior to those existing in 1914.(iii) In view of the reduced demands of the Home Government, it is clear that, if the armaments and shipbuilding industries are to have an adequate potential capacity for production in war, they must be able to obtain a steady supply of foreign orders, which, except perhaps in the case of the aircraft industry, is not now forthcoming on a sufficient scale.&quot;[9373]
4. We also desire to draw attention&apos;to&apos;the following Summary on page 8 of a Report by a Sub-Committee of the Principal Supply Officers Committee on Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries, attached to CP. 94 (33) : s 19. The only country other than Great Britain in which there is any evidence that the Armament Industry is apprehensive: of governmental hindrance is Sweden. In all other cases the State more or less encourages it as a source of revenue, or else, more frequently, directly assists it for reasons of National Defence.It can positively be stated that in no foreign country, with the exception of certain of those defeated in the late war, has the capacity to manufacture munitions been reduced, as compared with that existing in 1914. On the contrary, France, Italy and Russia have considerably extended their armament industries. Czechoslovakia and, to a lesser extent, Poland, under French influence, have followed suit. Germany, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria have each, in their respective degree, planned to overcome the disabilities imposed upon them by the Treaty of Versailles, not without the assistance of their late enemy, Italy.Other minor Powers have equally taken steps to ensure, in so far as they are able, that the maximum industrial effort of the country shall be available in emergency to manufacture the means of defence. A race to arms has been taking place. Nearly all countries have based their plans on the war of 1914, when huge forces were engaged and colossal quantities of armament stores were expended. In order to maintain the industry so set up in a state of efficiency, orders are sought from those countries whose armament industry is still, for one reason or another, in a comparatively backward state. The . keenest competition has ensued in the International Armament Trade. , Fearing or foreseeing future eventualities and prompted by motives of self-defence, the State has stepped in to encourage and assist its national industry to outbid competitors.&quot;5. From the point of view of defence, it is almost impossible to exaggerate the very dangerous and difficult position in which the British armament industry is now placed. Before the War there were very many firms in Great Britain engaged in carrying out armament orders for the British Government and for foreign Governments all over the world. These firms have practically all ceased to do armament work with the exception of Vickers Armstrong, and even this combination is being forced, mainly by lack of orders, to close down one depart-ment after another. Since the War the requirements of the Army have greatly fallen off, and the orders have had to be spread between the Royal Ordnance Factories and Vickers Armstrong. If this country became engaged in an important war, the situation would be even worse than it was in 1914, when, even with many armament firms in existence, it was impossible satisfactorily to main-tain the supply of munitions for our Forces. Several firms working for the Admiralty have recently had to close down and, what is perhaps even more serious, the services of highly skilled and experienced workmen, and the secrets of successful armament manufacture are being lost.6. We should have no great cause for anxiety if all other countries were suffering in the same way and to the same extent. This, of course, is far from being the case. The documents before us show conclusively that there is, in fact, in the aggregate, little, if any, reduction of armament production as a whole, but that while the British armament firms are getting very few foreign orders, these orders are being secured to an increasing extent by their foreign competitors. For example, we would draw attention to the very flourishing condition of the armament industry which has been built up in Czechoslovakia and which consists of the Skoda Works and its affiliated factories. The dividends paid by Skoda have risen steadily from 5 per cent, in 1920 to 28^ per cent, in 1930.. . 7. As a result of our examination of the problem it appears to us that action can be taken in two important directions to remove the existing handicaps on British manufacture and export of armaments, namely: (a) The termination forthwith of the present statutory impediment to the . inclusion in the Export Credits Guarantee Scheme of munitions of ;   ; war; and .:(b) The modification of the present system of licensing exports of armsand ammunition.
Export Credit guarantees for-Munitions of. War..8.&apos; The history and present position of this question-are summarised in the Note annexed to the Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade (CP. 99 (33);), which was before the Cabinet on the 12th April last. In para-graph 7 of that Note it is stated that the Export Credits Guarantee Department would welcome.any widening of the basis of its operations which would secure a greater: spread of risks, and for this reason would favour the inclusion in the Export Credits Guarantee Scheme of munitions of war, especially as, according to their information, Foreign Governments are normally most reluctant to default in respect of such purchases.9. From the point of view of defence we are unanimously in agreement with the Export Credits Guarantee Department that, if possible, munitions of war should henceforth be included in the Export Credits Guarantee Scheme. It will be for the Cabinet to consider whether the political objections to such inclusion are so grave as to outweigh the undoubted advantages from the point of view both of defence generally and of the maintenance of the British armament industry.10. If it is decided to adopt the proposal, special legislation will not be required, as effect can be given to the decision by omitting from the forthcoming Export Credits Guarantee Bill the provision which prohibits the giving of guarantees in respect of munitions of war.Modification  of  the  Present  System  of  Licensing  Exports  of  Arms  and A mmunitions.11. The facts with regard to this question are fully set out in the Report of the Sub-Committee of the Principal Supply Officers Committee attached as Appendix I hereto. As will be seen in Section VIII of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report, the two main difficulties arising out of the licensing system with which our armament manufacturers are confronted ares (a) the inability of manufacturers to clinch an immediate bargain, and(b) the liability of licences to be revoked or modified at any time.12. The Sub-Committee proposed to deal with these difficulties (a) by providing for the issue, subject to certain safeguards and conditions, of open general licences to approved armament manufacturers; and (b) by modifying the condition attached to licences giving His Majesty&apos;s Government power to revoke or modify licences. The actual proposals are given in Section IX of the Report and are incorporated in our conclusions below.13. The views of the Foreign Office on these proposals are set out in a letter, dated the 20th July, 1933, to the Secretary of the Principal Supply Officers Committee, attached as Appendix II hereto. For the reasons stated in this letter, and also because the disarmament negotiations are now entering upon a very delicate and critical stage, the Foreign Office deprecate any alteration at the moment of our existing system of export licences, and suggest that the question should be deferred for (say) three months so as to see how the disarmament situation develops.14. With the exception of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who was unable to attend our Meeting, we are in favour of the immediate adoption and bringing into force of the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendations as set out below. No foreign county has shown the least inclination to accept our suggestion that a system of export licences for arms and ammunition such as is already in force in this country should be generally adopted. We think that a decision on this question is overdue, and that while nothing is to be gained by further delay, the immediate putting into operation of the proposals will be highly beneficial to the British armament industry, and consequently of great value from the point of view of Imperial Defence.15. We submit the following conclusions to the Cabinet :-(1) Export Credit Guarantees for Munitions of War. From the point of view of defence we unanimously agree that, if possible/munitions of war should not hencefoi-th be excluded from the Export Credits Guarantee Scheme. It will be for the Cabinet to consider whether the political objections to their inclusion in the Scheme are so grave as to outweigh the defence and other advantages.
4(2) If the Cabinet decide in favour of the inclusion of munitions of war-in the Export Credits Guarantee Scheme, effect should be given to the decision by omitting from the forthcoming Export Credits Guarantee Bill the provision which prohibits the giving of guarantees in respect of munitions of war.(3) Modification of the present System of Licensing Exports of Arms and Ammunition-We recommend the Cabinet to adopt and to authorise the immediate putting into operation of the following recommenda-tions of the Sub-Committee on the System of Licensing Exports of Arms and Ammunition. The views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on this recommendation have been reserved : (i) That provision be made for the issue to armament manu-facturers, who are approved by the Service Departments as being of national importance, of open licences covering the export of all war material to such foreign Governments (or their accredited agents) as are recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government with the exception of the Governments of Abyssinia, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria. Every such licence should be subject to conditions framed so as to ensures (a) that the manufacturers to whom the open licences are issued should supply the Service Departments with information regarding orders for war material for foreign Governments, in such manner and at such times as the Departments may require; ,  and(&amp;) that all material exported under the open licences should be pre-entered with the Customs seven days before shipment, and that at the time of pre-entry the information specified in paragraph 41 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report (Appendix I) should be furnished to the Customs.(ii) That, if recommendation (i) is approved, the High Commis-sioners for the Dominions and India and the Crown Agents for the Colonies should be consulted on the subsidiary question of modifying the present system in regard to the Dominions, India and the Colonies.(iii) That the condition attached to the issue of every export licence for war material, empowering the Board of Trade to revoke or modify the licence at any time, should, in the case of open licences granted to manufacturers, be qualified by a statement that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have no intention of exercising that power except in cases where manufacturers in receipt of open licences have broken the conditions on which the licences were granted, or in the interests of Imperial security, or in pursuance of an international agreement to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are or may become a party.(4) We  also recommend  the  Cabinet  to  approve the Sub-Committee&apos;s remaining recommendation, namely That the amendment of the present law, in order to enable exports of arms to particular destinations to be prohibited in peace time, should be considered if and when amending arms legislation becomes necessary.Signed on behalf of the Committee : WALTER RUNCIMAN,Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, December 8, 1933.

REPORT.I. Introduction.Terms of Reference.1. WE were appointed by the Principal Supply Officers Committee at its 54th Meeting on the 15th March, 1933, as a Sub-Committee, with the following terms of reference : &quot;To consider the present system of licensing exports of arms, ammunition and other materials to which the Arms Export Prohibition Order, 1931, applies and to report what modifications, if any, are, in their view, desirable, having regard to (a) the interests of the Fighting Services; and(&amp;) the competitive position of the United Kingdom firms in obtaining orders from foreign countries.&quot;Constitution.2. The Sub-Committee as constituted consisted of representatives of the Foreign Office, Home Office, Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, Board of Trade and Department of Overseas Trade.3. In considering our terms of reference we have noted the conclusion of the Principal Supply Officers Committee in their Report on the position of the private armaments industry in Imperial Defence (P.S.O. 366) that a steady supply of foreign orders is necessary if the armament firms in the United. Kingdom are to have an adequate potential capacity for production in war. That Committee also express the opinion in the same Report that the existence of an effective control over the export of arms and the fear that an embargo on export may be imposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government at a time when arms are most required, has led foreign Governments to place their orders elsewhere.r. - - II. Powers.Origin. .4. The present powers to regulate the export of arms from the United Kingdom are derived from Section 8 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1879, as amended and extended by Section 1 of the Exportation of Arms Act, 1900, and Section 17 of the Finance Act, 1921. This legislation repeated and expanded much older legislation. The text of the more important provisions is given in Appendix (A).Effect and Scope.5. The combined effect of the provisions of 1879 and 1921 is to give power to prohibit by Proclamation or Order in Council the export or coastwise shipment of weapons and munitions of war of every description, and also of firearms not being weapons of war and ammunition for such firearms.6. The legislation of 1900 gives power to prohibit by Proclamation the exportation of arms,to any specified country or place &quot; in order to prevent such arms, ammunition, military or naval stores being used against Her Majesty&apos;s subjects or forces or against any forces engaged or which may be engaged in military or naval operations in co-operation with Her Majesty&apos;s forces.&quot;* Thus power to prohibit export to a specified country can be used only when hostilities involving this country are in existence or are threatened; at other times any prohibition must be general in its scope, and exports to a particular destination can be controlled only by means of a licensing system.Warships.   .7. There is now special legislation dealing with warships. By Section 1 of the Treaties of Washington Act, 1922, it is prohibited to build, equip, or despatch any vessel of war without a licence from the Admiralty, but there is a* These powers were intended primarily to prevent the export of arms and ammunition to the Boxer insurgents in China.   Immediately after the Act came into force, however, the Boxer rising was suppressed; and apparently no. proclamation prohibiting the export of arms to China &apos; was actually issued.&apos;&apos; &quot; &apos;&apos;1, &apos;        &apos;:       ,: &apos;&apos;- -        -        -   ; : - -[8664] b 2
4proviso that a licence shall not be refused unless it appears to the Admiralty necessary to do so for the purpose of securing the observance of obligations imposed by the Washington Treaty for the limitation of naval armaments.8. It should be noted that warships are not covered by the general legislation dealing with export of arms and that the export of naval craft and their armament on foreign order is subject only to the Washington legislation although naval armaments exported separately require a licence issued in pursuance of the general legislation. Special attention is called to the fact that licences under the Washington Act cannot be refused except for the purpose of securing the observance of international obligations.Aircraft.9. Unarmed aircraft and aircraft engines would not fall within the scope of the system of export licences if it were not for the Ethiopian Arms Traffic Treaty of 1930 (see paragraph 12), which requires every consignment of aircraft and aircraft engines to Abyssinia to be specifically licensed. After that Treaty came into force, the position of aircraft manufacturers was safeguarded by the issue of what is known as an &quot;open general licence&quot; in respect of aircraft and aircraft engines under which manufacturers are allowed to export freely except to Abyssinia. In fact the Air Ministry have had for many years a working arrangement with the manufacturers under which the consent of the Ministry is obtained before aircraft are exported, and that Department consults the Foreign Office where considerations of policy appear to be involved. It is, of course, in the interest of the manufacturers to comply with the wishes of the Air Ministry, who are fully satisfied with the working of this arrangement.III. History of Control of Arms Traffic.Prior to 1914.10. A note on the history of the control of the arms traffic is attached as Appendix (B).Attention is drawn to the fact that prior to 1914 there was no prohibition on the exportation of arms from this country and therefore no licensing system. The present system is to a great extent a legacy of the general system enforced during the late war for the control of exports. Only arms, ammunition, &amp;c., now remain subject to licence on exportation.International Conventions, 1919 and 1925.11. As regards the international aspect, prior to 1914, the problem of control was related mainly to the slave trade. The measures taken to cope with the traffic were local in character and no system of export licensing existed. Since the close of the war two international Conventions dealing with the arms traffic have been signed in 1919 and 1925, the latter superseding the former. Under these a system of export prohibition and licence was to be set up by contracting countries. The 1925 Convention was ratified by His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1930 with the reservation that ratification would not become effective until ratifications by the other principal arms-producing States had also become effective. This condition has not been fulfilled and the convention has remained inoperative.Ethiopian Treaty.12. The only international obligation which binds His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and involves the control of the export of arms from this country is the Ethiopian Arms Traffic Treaty, 1930, to which France, Italy, Ethiopia and the United Kingdom are parties. This applies the provisions of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 to Abyssinia. Accordingly His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound not to permit the export of arms Of any kind (or of aircraft and aircraft engines) to Abyssinia except under specific export licence.Disarmament Conference.13. The control of the arms traffic has also been among the subjects considered at the present Disarmament Conference.    The discussions have been
5based on the assumption that some kind of control is necessary, but there has been a difference of opinion as to the form which it should take. -His Majestyjs Government have instructed the United Kingdom delegates to the effect that they should insist that any convention should provide for an export licensing system for arms and ammunition, such as is already in force in this country.TV. Description of Existing Export. Licensing System.Arms Export Prohibition Order, 1931.14. The present system has been in forcejwithout substantial alteration since 1921 and is now based on an Arms Export Prohibition Order in Council which came into force on the 1st June, 1931. This specifies twenty classes of material, the export of which from the United Kingdom is prohibited save under licence. The issue of the Order was accompanied by open general licences permitting unrestricted export in certain cases. The general effect is that the export of war material and rifled weapons of every description is subject to licence whatever the destination; the export of aircraft and aircraft engines and of bayonets, swords and lances is subject to licence only when the destination is Abyssinia; and the export of shot guns and ammunition and of certain types of gunpowder and industrial explosives is subject to licence only when the destination is in one of certain special zones in Asia and Africa (see paragraph 26 (/)). The text of the Order and of the open general licences is given in Appendix (C).15. The administration of the Order is carried out by the Imports and Exports Licensing Section of the Board of Trade which acts upon the advice of other Departments, mainly the Foreign Office, Home Office and the Service Departments.Period of Investigation.16. The time which elapses between the. receipt of an application for a licence and its issue is usually between two and seven days, according to the time taken by the Departments in making the necessary investigations. In urgent cases, as where an armament firm is asked at very short notice to submit samples for adjudication in a foreign country, special steps are taken to expedite the necessary enquiries and the licence may be issued within 48 hours of the receipt of the application.Period of Licence.17. Licences are normally valid for a period of three months from the date of issue and may be renewed at the expiration of that period. If a request is made for a licence to be valid for a period exceeding three months the Department, in accordance with a Cabinet decision of 1925, is required to seek the approval of the Cabinet. This is known as a Ci firm &quot; licence. No request of this kind has been received since 1928, firms relying where necessary on the renewal of the ordinary licence of three months.Conditions of Licence.18.   A copy of the form of export licence (Appendix (D)) is attached and particular attention is directed to the conditions printed on the licence itself. These conditions are very relevant to the present inquiry as foreign customers of . United Kingdom firms will be familiar with the form of licence issued.19. The most, important condition is that the Board of Trade may modify or revoke the licence at any time without reason given. This is. the common form on all Board of Trade licences and is inserted in order to make it clear that the licensee would have no right to compensation if the action indicated is taken. A list of all cases in which licences have been revoked or renewal refused is given in Appendix (E).&apos; *
20. Arising out of certain cases* in which licences were revoked or renewal was refused, the Cabinet in 1925 issued an instruction that a warning notice should be attached to every war material licence at the time of issue. The terms of this notice are as follows : &quot; Attention is called to the fact that licences for the export of Arms and Ammunition are granted for a period of three months only and that no guarantee can be given, or has ever been implied, that they will be renewed after the expiration of that period (the period being limited in order that His Majesty&apos;s Government may have an opportunity to reconsider the matter, if necessary).All firms accepting foreign orders which require more than three months to complete must understand that they do so at their own risk.It should, of course, be understood that this notice does not modify the condition under which all licences are issued, viz., that in exceptional circumstances, they may be cancelled or withdrawn at any time, even before the expiry of the three months without reason given, the risk of which is, of course, taken by the licensee.&quot;21. Subsequently, in 1925, when the Cabinet considered the question of the grant of licences for a period of more than three months, it was decided that, where such licences were issued (after approval in each case by the Cabinet: see paragraph 17 above) the form of licence should omit the condition relating to the power of the Board of Trade to revoke or modify a licence at any time. In its place the licence is accompanied by a letter stating that the licence will not be withdrawn &apos;&apos; save in the event of circumstances of an altogether exceptional character arising which the Board of Trade are at present quite unable to foresee.&quot;Categories of Licences.22. Applications t for export licences may be divided broadly into three categories : (a) Applications relating to war material.  This category can be sub-dividedunder the following heads : (i) Applications by manufacturers.(ii) Applications by arms dealers and others which relate to sales ofGovernment surplus stores, (iii) Applications by representatives of the Dominion Governments, the Government of India or the Crown Agents for the Colonies for licences to export material to the Government concerned.(b) Applications for licences to export arms other than war material,e.g., sporting rifles, shot guns, revolvers, pistols, ammunition and industrial explosives.(c) Applications by persons who do not possess a certificate issued under theFirearms Act, 1920, entitling them to hold firearms in this country, but who wish to purchase firearms to take with them on going abroad.Number of Licences Issued. -23. The total number of export licences issued in 1932 was 10,897, of which by far the greatest number is represented by category (b). The available statistics show that the number of licences issued to manufacturers and arms dealers for the export of war material was 410, representing only between 3 per cent, and 4 per cent, of the total number issued, although they cover by far the greater part of the value of the goods exported. Of the 410 licences, 357, were issued to arms manufacturers.* After the war it was forbidden to send arms to Soviet Russia. This embargo was removed by the Labour Government in 1924. The B.S.A. Company and Vickers, Limited, obtained licences in that year for the export of certain machine guns and parts to the Soviet Government. When the Conservative Government came into power in December 1924 the embargo on arms for Russia was again imposed (It was removed by the Labour Government in 1929 and is no longer in force.) By this time some, but not all, of the material had been shipped. The reversal of the Government policy involved&quot; revocation of one licence and refusal to renew three others (for details, see Appendix (E)). The B.S.A. Company and Vickers, Limited, were accordingly prevented from completing their contracts and made claims for compensation, which were refused.f No licences are, of course, required for export of war material by the Service Departments, who, in lieu of a licence, supply the Customs with a certificate.
Refusals to Grant Licences.25. Apart from cases arising out, of general embargoes, refusals to issue licences for which specific applications have been submitted are comparatively rare. It is, however, the case that a manufacturer or dealer does hot usually accept an order for war material without first ascertaining by preliminary enquiry whether an application is likely to succeed. The refusal of licences may be due to reasons of policy or to such reasons as the failure of the applicant to disclose the ultimate consignee or non-compliance with the Firearms Act, 1920. Examples of cases in which licences have been refused to arms manufacturers are given in Appendix (F).V. Uses of the Licensing System.26. The primary objects of pre-war legislation were presumably to conserve national resources and to prevent in time of actual or threatened war the export of arms for use against this country and its allies. The Great War brought with it both prohibition of exports and a licensing system which survived after the war. Since then they have been adapted in peace time to other purposes, both national and international, e.g.. restricting the world traffic in arms. The various uses to which the licensing system has been, or can be, put are discussed below.   *(a) Conservation of United Kingdom Resources in Times of Emergency.If war were imminent it would no doubt be necessary to impose forthwith export restrictions covering a list of goods which would go far beyond the list contained in the present Arms Export Prohibition Order; but the maintenance of a system of prohibition and licensing in peace-time is not a necessary condition in order to enable such emergency action to be taken.(b) Prevention of Arms and Ammunition from reaching Actual or PotentialEnemies.Here, again, if war were imminent, the necessary action could be taken to prevent the export of war material to particular destinations. In other times no useful purpose would be served by preventing the sale of war material to a. potential enemy, as a country with money to spend on munitions will get its supplies elsewhere if not from us. Moreover, it has been pointed out that there are, in fact, certain advantages in supplying munitions to foreign countries who are possible enemies, because in the event of war or emergency it is possible to cut off supplies, not only of the munitions themselves, but also of spare parts and ammunition for those already supplied.(c) Imposition of Embargoes in pursuance of International Obligations.An instance in the past was the agreement entered into by the representatives of the Powers in Peking in 1919 known as the China Arms Embargo Agreement, under which the parties agreed to restrain their subjects from exporting arms to China. The agreement was strictly observed by this country and the Dominions, and to a certain extent by the. United States, but was evaded by other countries, especially France and Italy. The only definite obligation of this kind at present in force is that imposed by the Ethiopian Arms Traffic Treaty of 1930, to which France, Italy, Ethiopia and the United Kingdom are parties (see paragraph 12). Under existing legislation obligations under this Treaty cannot be implemented except through a general licensing system. Similar considerations apply to any undertaking which His Majesty&apos;s Government might enter into in agreement with other Governments to put an embargo on the export of arms to countries which are at war. A case in point is the proposed embargo on export to Bolivia and Paraguay which His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed to impose if certain other specified countries (21 in all) will take similar action.(d) Imposition of Embargoes not in pursuance of International Obligations.The most recent example is the embargo imposed by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment this year upon the export of arms to China and Japan. Since the war there,has, from time&apos;to time, been a similar embargo on the export of war material to Russia: The effect of action of this kind upon the ability of armament manufacturers to obtain foreign orders is discussed in paragraph 30.
(e) Prevention of Arms or Ammunition of Secret Design from leaving theCountry.We understand that the Service Departments are satisfied that the licensing system is of little value in this connection, and that the desired result can equally well be attained through their close working arrangements with the armament manufacturers.(f) Prevention of Arms from reaching certain Territories in Africa and Asia.(i) Under present arrangements the exports of arms to certain zones in Africa and Asia, which. were scheduled for special treatment under the inoperative Geneva Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, are all subject to licence; exports to these destinations constitute an exception to the open general licence issued in respect of shot guns and certain kinds of gunpowder and explosives. Enquiries which we have made from the Departments concerned do not convince us that the licensing system in this country plays an effective part in the prevention of the traffic. We would point out, firstly, that the measures taken to prevent uncontrolled traffic in arms in these places must be essentially local in character, and, secondly, that the traffic is international and the licensing system in this country has no significance so far as the arms come from other countries.(ii) Under the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921 and letters exchanged in connection with it the Afghan Government is under an obligation to inform the British Minister at Kabul whenever an order for war material is placed abroad for delivery through British ports. Consequently, all applications for a licence to export arms from this country to Afghanistan are referred to the India Office for advice. The arrangements, however, relate only to the import of war material through India, and any necessary control of such import could presumably be exercised at Indian ports. In any case, the licensing system here can be of no use in the case of any arms ordered from countries other than the United Kingdom.(iii) The Government of India keep a stringent watch on the import of firearms at Indian ports in order to prevent them from passing into the possession of revolutionaries and terrorists. The India Office are disposed to attach some importance to the licensing system in this country as a check upon this traffic. They point out that the traffic originates mainly in certain continental ports, and they are seeking the co-operation of the appropriate foreign Governments in restrictive measures. They hope, therefore, that meantime the present licensing system will not be relaxed. In this connection we would observe that the traffic in which the Government of India are primarily interested is that of the import into India of firearms, such as revolvers, and does not concern our armament manufacturers to any extent. Moreover, prospective smugglers of such weapons do not apply for export licences.(g) Assisting Foreign Governments in regulating Arms Imports.His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed with certain foreign countries  Spain, Portugal, China and Mexico that no licences shall be issued for the export of arms to those countries except with the permission of the Government concerned. This may be some convenience to the foreign Governments in question, but it confers no benefit on the United Kingdom, and should presumably not be allowed to impede any relaxation that it may be desired to make in favour of United Kingdom manufacturers.(h) Facilitating Purchase in the United Kingdom of Personal Arms by Personsgoing Abroad.There is another use, relatively unimportant, to which the system is put. A person who does not possess a firearm certificate, but wishes to purchase firearms in this country to take abroad with him, can do so on obtaining an export licence, the arms being sent direct to the ship. In the absence of a licensing system, provision could be made for the necessary authority in these cases to be given by the police, but the administration, not being centralised, would lack uniformity, and applicants would probably experience difficulty and delay in obtaining the required permission. Consequently some firearms would be bought abroad which are now bought here. i
VI. Effects of the Present System uponthe Competitive Position ofUnited Kingdom Manufacturers.27. We are assured that armament firms in this country are severely-handicapped in obtaining foreign orders by their inability to clinch a deal immediately, owing to the necessity of obtaining an export licence,1 and also by the uncertainty arising from the possibility that such licence may subsequently be revoked or may not be renewed a,t the end of the period of three months for which it is valid (see paragraph 20).   -28. The obligation to obtain a licence for the export of individual consign-ments must obviously constitute a seripus obstacle to manufacturers in dealing with possible orders from foreign customers who insist upon an immediate reply. This consideration must, however, be distinguished from the question of possible delay in dealing with an application for a licence. In this respect we are satisfied that there is no ground for complaint. The administration of any system must necessarily occupy a certain time, but the information before us shows that the time taken in dealing with applications for licences is reduced to a minimum, and it would not seem that in this respect the system imposes an appreciable handicap upon the firms concerned (see paragraph 16).29. The complaint as to uncertainty, however, is much more serious. As explained in paragraph 19, the licence itself contains a statement that it may be modified or revoked at any time by the Board of Trade without reason given, and where it relates to war material, steps are taken to emphasise this possibility by attaching a special notice to each licence at the time of issue (paragraph 20).30. The feeling of uncertainty attributable to these conditions has recently been increased by the embargo which in February last was placed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and by no other Government, on exports of war material from the United Kingdom to China and Japan. Armament manufacturers realise that the Government must have complete power to stop at any time the export of arms for reasons of Imperial security, and they would have no legitimate objection to restrictions on export which arose out of an international agreement which was actually in force in the principal arms-producing countries. But they claim to be freed from uncertainties to which their foreign competitors are not subject, and, in particular, the possibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government enforcing prohibitions or withholding licences in pursuance of international aims in regard to which there is no agreement for international action.31. &apos; The effects of this feeling of uncertainty are not confined to armament manufacturers. There is evidence that United Kingdom producers of steel and other raw material for armaments lost orders at the time of the recent embargo by reason of the fear of foreign Governments that His Majesty&apos;s Government might at any time place an embargo on these materials also.VII. Limitations of Existing Legislation.   .32. Before we discuss the measures that might be taken to improve the competitive position of the armament firms, it is desirable to call attention to certain features of existing legislation. As already explained (see paragraph 6), prohibitions relating to the export of arms in peace-time must be general in character; unless hostilities are in existence or imminent, the law does not permit the prohibition of arms exports to particular destinations. Hence, if in fact it is desired to control the export of arms to a particular place, it is necessary to issue a general prohibition accompanied by an open general licence in favour of alb destinations except those to which it is. desired to prevent export save under specific licence. Accordingly, so long as the law remains in its present form, and this country is bound by the terms of the Ethiopian Treaty, a, general prohibition of the export of all arms must be in force, and there can be no question of revoking the Arms Export Prohibition Order of 1931; any mitigation of the system of specific licensing must be effected by an extension Of the present T8664] &apos; &apos; c &apos; -&apos;;
system of open general licences which, for example, is now applied in the case of unarmed aircraft.33. It would doubtless be more convenient if the law enabled His Majesty&apos;s Government to prohibit in peace-time, as well as in times of emergency, the export -of arms to a particular destination. It is suggested that if at any time amending arms legislation became necessary, this point should be considered. Such an occasion would arise if legislation had to be passed as the result of the present discussions at Geneva relating to the control of arms traffic and manufacture.34. Meantime, we desire to make certain proposals within the framework of the existing law which, we think, should be of material assistance to armament manufacturers in obtaining foreign orders, while maintaining effective Govern-ment control over the export of arms from this country.VIII. Proposals.35. The object of the two proposals which we submit is to deal respectively with the two main difficulties arising out of the licensing system with which our armament manufacturers are confronted. As shown in paragraph 27, these are : (a) The inability of manufacturers to clinch an immediate bargain, and(b) The liability of licences to be revoked or modified at any time.Both proposals follow the lines of arrangements already in existence.Issue of Open Licences to Approved Armament Manufacturers.36. In making this proposal we have had prominently in mind the present arrangements under which an open general licence is in force in respect of aircraft and aircraft engines (see Appendix C), and the manufacturers concerned are therefore able to export without obtaining specific licences. As already pointed out, this arrangement has worked to the entire satisfaction of the Air Ministry.37. Our proposal is that open licences should be granted to armament manufacturers, who are approved by the Service Departments as being of national importance, for the export of war material to such foreign Governments (or their accredited agents) as are recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Exceptions would have to be made for Abyssinia, which has a treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government prohibiting the export of war material except under specific licence, and also for the Governments of Germany, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria, which have treaty obligations not to import war material. It may be noted that such open licences would not have covered export in any cases of the kinds enumerated in Appendix (F), in which specific licences were refused.38. We observe that, since this proposal concerns only export to Govern-ments or their accredited agents, its adoption would not appear to run counter to the control of exports to the various zones and countries referred to in paragraph 26 (/).39. A list of approved firms could readily be prepared by the Service Departments, and we understand that it would be of comparatively small dimensions, consisting of some ten or twelve armament firms and sixteen aircraft manufacturers (in respect of aircraft armament). These manufacturers produce the bulk of the war material exported from this country under Board of Trade licence.40. These open licences would cover all the kinds of material enumerated in the Arms Export Prohibition Order, except in so far as export is already allowed under existing open general licences. They would be made subject to a special condition that the manufacturers to whom they were issued should supply the Service Departments with information regarding orders for war material for foreign Governments in such manner and at such times as the Departments may require. If a manufacturer failed to comply with this condition, the sanction would be the withdrawal of his open licence.
.41. While we confidently expect that full information regarding the export of war material will be supplied by approved manufacturers, it is desirable to have some independent record which will detect attempted abuse of the arrange-ments by unauthorised firms and provide a check on the transactions of those on the selected list. We recommend therefore that every firm exporting arms under an open licence should be required to furnish to the Customs the following information in respect of each shipment: (a) A description sufficient for the identification of the articles to which it relates, and their number or weight.(b) The name and address of the exporter.(c) The name of the purchasing Government.(d) The name of the consignee, if not identical with (c).This requirement would be linked to the existing rule that all shipments of war material are subject to :&apos; pre-entry &quot; with the Customs, i.e., exporters have to give notice of their intention to export. At present the period that must elapse between &apos;&apos; pre-entry&apos;&apos; and shipment is not specified. It is suggested that in the cases covered by our proposal a period of seven days should be prescribed in the licence. This would allow time for the Customs to let the Defence Departments have particulars of the intended exportation, and for these Departments to consult the Foreign Office in any case of doubt. Unless the Customs received an intimation that the shipment should be delayed, the arms would be allowed to leave the country in the ordinary course.42. The above plan, by relieving approved manufacturers from the necessity for applying for a separate licence in respect of each consignment, would enable them to conclude an immediate deal, and foreign customers would know that these manufacturers could accept foreign orders forthwith without obtaining formal permission from His Majesty&apos;s Government. We understand that the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the Disarmament Conference have, in accordance with their instructions, urged the adoption of the precise system of licensing at present in force in the United Kingdom. In fact, the Arms Traffic Convention, 1925, has been taken as the basis of discussion at Geneva, and we are advised that the proposal we are submitting would be consistent with its provisions, since the obligation to furnish the particulars specified to the Customs will constitute an export declaration within the meaning-of Articles 4 and 14 of that Convention.43. If our proposal were adopted, the most important cases in which individual licences would still be required would be as follows : (a) Export by an approved firm to a Government not covered by the openlicence, or to a private person or corporation. (&amp;) Export of war material by an arms dealer.(c) Export of rifled arms and ammunition therefor by any person or firm notholding an open licence. id) Export of firearms as personal luggage by any person not possessing afirearm certificate.Position of Dominions, India and Crown A gents.44. The India Store Department has written to the Committee urging that the Government of India should be exempted from the requirements of the licensing system in regard to their exports of arms to India. If the above plan for granting open licences is approved, the question of treating Dominion, Indian and Colonial exports on similar lines obviously arises. In fact licences in these cases are now granted automatically, and it is doubtful whether alternative arrangements would be of any advantage. We suggest that if our proposal for open licences is approved, the question of alternative arrangements could be discussed with the High Commissioners and the Crown Agents.Modification of the Condition attached to Licences giving His Majesty&apos;s Government power to revoke or modify Licences. 45.   The present position in regard to this condition is described in para-graphs 18 to 21, and the uncertainties to which it gives rise are indicated in [8664] c 2
1.2paragraphs 27 to 31. We are of opinion that His Majesty&apos;s Government must retain the power to revoke or modify a licence at any time, but we suggest that the circumstances in which such action would be taken might be made the subject of a statement of Government intention, so far as open licences to manufacturers are concerned.We are advised that the condition empowering the Board of Trade to revoke or modify the licence at any time might, without impairing the complete discretion of the Government, be supplemented by a statement that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have no intention of exercising that power except in cases in which manu-facturers in receipt of open licences have broken the conditions on which the licences were granted, or in the interests of Imperial security, or in pursuance of -an international agreement to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are or may become a, party. In cases where this statement is made the present notice used in certain oases (see paragraph 20) would no longer be issued. In making this proposal we have had in mind the provisions of the Washington Act of 1922, under which the Admiralty cannot refuse a licence for the building equipment or despatch of a warship, except for the purpose of observing the obligations imposed by the Treaty.It will be observed that a definite reservation is made in regard to any international obligations undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The proposed statement would not therefore affect the position of the United Kingdom Delegation at the Disarmament Conference in regard to the traffic in arms.IX. Recommendations.46.   We therefore submit the following recommendations :-(1) That provision be made for the issue to armament manufacturers, who are approved by the Service Departments as being of national importance, of open licences covering the export of all war material to such foreign Governments (or their accredited agents), as are recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government with the exception of the Governments of Abyssinia, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria (paragraph 37). Every such licence should be subject to conditions framed so as to ensure (a) that the manufacturers to whom the open licences are issued should supply the Service Departments with information regarding orders for war material for foreign Governments, in such manner and at such times as the Departments may require (paragraph 40); and(&amp;) that all material exported under the open licences should be pre-yntered with the Customs seven days before shipment, and that at the time of pre-entry the information specified in paragraph 41 should be furnished to the Customs.(2) That, if recommendation (1) is approved, the High Commissioners for the Dominions and India and the Crown Agents for the Colonies should be consulted on the subsidiary question of modifying the present system in regard to the Dominions, India and the Colonies (paragraph 44).(3) That the condition attached to the issue of every export licence for war material, empowering the Board of Trade to revoke or modify the licence at any time, should, in the case of open licences granted to manufacturers, be qualified by a statement that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention of exercising that power except in cases where manufacturers in receipt of open licences have broken the conditions on which the licences were granted, or in the interests of Imperial security, or in pursuance of an international agreement to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are or may become a party (paragraph 45).
(4) That the amendment of the present law, in order to enable exports of arms to particular destinations to be prohibited in peace time, should be considered if and when amending arms legislation becomes necessary (paragraph 33).(Signed) H.

APPENDIX (A).Extracts from Acts of Parliament.Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1879.Section 8. THE following goods may by proclamation or Order in Council be prohibitedeither to be exported or carried coastwise : Arms, ammunition and gunpowder, military and naval stores, and any articles which Her Majesty shall judge capable of being converted into or made useful in increasing the quantity of military or naval stores, provisions, or any sort of victual which may be used as food for man; and if any goods so prohibited shall be exported or brought to any quay or other place to be shipped for exportation from the United Kingdom or carried coastwise, or be waterborne to be so exported or carried, they shall be forfeited, and the exporter or his agent or the shipper of any such goods shall be liable to the penalty of one hundred pounds.Exportation of Arms Act, 1900.It shall be lawful for Her Majesty by proclamation to prohibit the exportation of all or any of the following articles, namely : Arms, ammunition, military and naval stores, and any article which Her Majesty shall judge capable of being converted into or made useful in increasing the quantity of arms, ammunition, or military or naval stores, to any country or place therein named, whenever Her Majesty shall judge such prohibition to be expedient, in order to prevent such arms, ammunition, military or naval stores being used against Her Majesty&apos;s subjects or forces, or against any forces engaged or which may be engaged in military or naval operations in co-operation with Her Majesty&apos;s forces.This Act shall be read as one with the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1879, and all the provisions of that Act, so far as they are applicable to the exportation of prohibited goods, shall apply as if they were embodied in this Act, and as if section 1 of this Act were part of section 8 of that Act.Finance Act, 1921.Section 17. (1) Section 8 of the Customs- and Inland Revenue Act, 1879 (which givespower to prohibit the exportation and carriage coastwise of certain goods), shall extend to weapons and munitions of war of every description and firearms not being weapons of war, and ammunition for such firearms, as it applies to the goods therein mentioned.(2) The said section, as amended by this section, shall extend so as to give power to prohibit the shipment as ship&apos;s stores, whether on vessels proceeding to foreign ports or on coastwise voyages, of any of the goods to which the said section applies, and the provision in the said section relating to a penalty shall have effect accordingly subject to the necessary modifications.Treaties of Washington Act, 1922.1.

Legislation empowering the prohibition of export of Arms and 1846. Ammunition is traceable as far back as the Tonnages and Poundages Act (12 Charles II, Cap. 4), and these powers are perpetuated in several later Acts, e.g., 1755, 1825, 1833 and 1845. In Section 112 of the last-quoted Act (Customs Act, 1845) there is set out in a Table of Prohibitions and Restrictions Outwards, the following list of goods which may be prohibited to be exported by Proclamation or Order in Council : Arms, Ammunition and Gunpowder.Military Stores, Naval Stores and any Articles (except Copper), which Her Majesty shall judge capable of being converted into or made useful in increasing the Quantity of Military or Naval Stores.Provisions or any Sort of Victual which may be used as Food by Man.The penalty for contravention of an export prohibition was forfeiture of the goods.2.   With the addition of a clause to cover goods &quot;carried coastwise,&quot; this 1853. provision was embodied in section 150 of the Customs Consolidation Act of 1853, which, in turn, was re-enacted without amendment in Section 138 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, and was repeated in Section 8 of the Customs and Inland 1876. Revenue Act, 1879, in similar words with the provision, in addition, of a fine for 1879. contravention of a prohibition, where previously the only penalty had been forfeiture.   This last section is still in force.3. So far, an Order or Proclamation prohibiting the export of arms could only be general, that is to say, any prohibition had to cover export to all destinations. By Section 1 of the Exportation of Arms Act, 1900, however, power was given to prohibit by Proclamation the exportation of arms to any specified country or place &quot;whenever Her Majesty shall judge such prohibition to be expedient in order to prevent such arms, ammunition, military or naval stores being used against Her Majesty&apos;s subjects or forces or against any forces engaged or which may be engaged in military or naval operations in co-operation with Her Majesty&apos;s forces.&quot; The new powers were intended primarily to prevent the export of arms and ammunition to the Boxer insurgents in China. Immediately after the Act came into force, however, the Boxer rising was suppressed; and apparently no proclamation prohibiting the export of arms to China was actually issued.4. After the outbreak of the European War the power to make Proclamations prohibiting export was extended by the Customs (Exportation Restriction) Acts, 1914, to cover the export of all articles of any description; and by the Customs* The Washington Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament, 1922.
(Exportation Restriction) Act, 1915, power was given to secure that any article to which a prohibition applied was delivered tot an authorised consignee. These extended powers were valid only in time of war; but they had an important bearing on the development of the export licensing system.5. The powers to prohibit the export of articles other than arms, ammuni-tion, &amp;c, lapsed after the War; but Section 17 of the Finance Act, 1921, extended Section 8 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1879, to cover weapons and munitions of war of every description, and also firearms not being weapons of war and ammunition for such firearms. It also gave power to prohibit shipment as ship&apos;s stores.6. The text of those sections quoted above, which are still in force, is given in Appendix (A).The War Period.7. Export Prohibition. Until the outbreak of the European War, although the necessary powers existed, there was apparently no. actiial prohibition of the exportation of arms from this country. Commencing in 1890, however, a daily return of all arms exported was sent by the Customs to the Admiralty.8. In 1914, immediately on the outbreak of war, a Proclamation was issued under Section 8 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1879, prohibiting the exportation of certain articles, including arms and ammunition, to all destina-tions. The Proclamation was absolute in its terms, i.e., it made no mention of exports under licence, but a rough and ready export licensing system was devised almost immediately. At the outset applications for licences were submitted to the Customs, who forwarded them to the various Departments interested in the goods. In cases of doubt applications were submitted to the Committee on Trade with the Enemy -a body which had been established at the beginning of the war to deal with questions relating to the law on trading with the enemy. As the list of prohibited articles continued to expand it was found impossible for the Committee to deal with the great amount of work involved, and the War Trade Department was accordingly created by Treasury Minute, dated the 17th February, 1915, in order to control inter alia the issue of export licences. In addition the War Trade Department dealt with questions relating to the Black Lists, to embargoes, to agreements with trading bodies in neutral countries and to trading relations with Allies.9. The prohibition of the exportation of war material continued without interruption until the end of the war, by which time almost everything which was capable of being of use to the enemy was on the prohibited list. With the cessation of hostilities, however, the export restrictions began to be relaxed, unt;i the time came when only arms, ammunition, &amp;c, remained subject to licence on exportation. The War Trade Department was wound up, in common with other war-time Departments, and the Imports and Exports Licensing Section became a unit of the Board of Trade.10. International Control. As the Great War progressed the prospect of an immense surplus of arms all over the world when peace came led to the appointment in 1917 of a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence with Lord Islington as Chairman &quot; to consider the general question of the traffic in arms after the war with special reference to native races.&quot; The Sub-Committee recommended that immediately after the War an effort should be made to obtain international agreement (1) to control the arms traffic, with particular reference to special zones in Asia and Africa, in which it was regarded as specially desirable to prevent arms from reaching the native races; (2) to prohibit the export of automatic pistols and ammunition of every kind to any destination except under Government licence.The Committee on the Control of Firearms, which reported in 1918 to the Minister of Reconstruction, concurred in both these recommendations, and, in regard to the second, went further in recommending a general export prohibi-tion covering all firearms, such prohibition to be modified at discretion by issuing licences freely for sporting guns and parts of firearms to approved destinations.
Post-War Development.11. Export Prohibition. In 1919 the Board of Trade issued an open general licence authorising exportation without specific licence of cartridges, charges, &amp;o, industrial explosives, double-barrelled guns and sporting rifles to certain destinations. This was subsequently modified, at the instance of the Foreign Office, in view of the provisions of the Arms Traffic Convention of the 10th September, 1919; and the revised open general licence excepted consignments to destinations within the prohibited areas specified in that Convention (see paragraph 14 below).12. On the 24th March, 1921, the residue of the war-time Orders prohibiting the export of war material was replaced by a new Order defining, more closely than was done in the Acts of Parliament, the kinds of material whose export was prohibited, and making, for the first time, specific provision for licences.* The definition included fifteen classes of war material, which, although not quite so comprehensive, were substantially the same as classes (i) to (xv) of the list in the existing Order (see Appendix (C)), and by a further Order made on the 13th December, 1921, the prohibition was extended to shipment as ship&apos;s stores. This last Order remained in force until 1931, when the ratification of the Ethiopian Arms Traffic Treaty, 1930, made it necessary to prohibit the export to Abyssinia of arms, including bayonets, swords and lances, and of aircraft (see paragraph 18 below). As the power to prohibit export to a specified country applied only where there were actual or threatened hostilities, a special Order prohibiting the export to Abyssinia could not.be made. A new general Order was, therefore, made on the 19th May, 1931, extending the export prohibition to cover aircraft and bayonets, swords and lances, and at the same time an open general licence was issued permitting the export of those articles to all destinations except Abyssinia. The opportunity was taken to include separately in the prohibition certain classes of war material which had previously been regarded as falling within the classes specified in the 1921 Order (e.g., a tank had been regarded as a gun mounting). The text of the Order, which remains in force to-day, is given in Appendix (C).13. Ships of war and their armament are not covered by the export licensing system administered by the Board of Trade, but the licence of the Admiralty is required for their building and for their despatch, in accordance with the Treaties of Washington Act, 1922.The Arms Traffic Conventions.14. The 1919 Arms Traffic Convention [Cmd. 414), signed at St.-Germain-en-Laye.- Under Article 1 of this Convention, the High Contracting Parties undertook to prohibit the exportation of a short list of &quot; arms of war,&quot; except under licence. Under Article 2, they undertook also to prohibit the export of firearms and ammunition other than arms and munitions of war, to certain specified zones. These included the zones covered by the Brussels Act of 1890 relating to the slave trade. The Convention also provided for the annual publication of certain statistics of licences issued. The export from the United Kingdom of the arms to which the Convention related was already prohibited, so that, if the Convention had been ratified, no further action on this score would have been necessary so far as this country was concerned. The Convention was, in fact, never ratified; but His Majesty&apos;s Plenipotentiaries had signed the Protocol, which reads as follows : &apos;&apos; At the moment of signing the Convention of even date relating to the trade in arms and ammunition, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries declare in the name of their respective Governments that they would regard it as-contrary to the intention of the High Contracting Parties, and to the spirit of this Convention that, pending the coming into force of the Convention, a Contracting Party should adopt any measure which is contrary to its provisions.&quot;It was in accordance with the obligations which His Majesty&apos;s Government had assumed under this Protocol that export of non-military firearms and ammunition to the areas specified in the Convention was excepted from the Open General Licence of 1919.* The Acts of Parliament make no provision for licences; but power to prohibit export clearly includes power to except from th/3 prohibition goods specified in an export licence.[8664] d
15. The 1925 Arms Traffic Convention (Cmd. 3448), signed at Geneva.  This Convention is very much wider in scope than that of 1919 as regards the classes of goods it covers, and in many other respects. The special zones in respect of which exceptional control has to be exercised, are, however, smaller in extent than the prohibited areas defined in the 1919 Convention. The goods to which the 1925 Convention relates are classified into five categories : Category I includes arms, ammunition and implements of war, exclusively designed and intended for land, sea or aerial warfare; Category II, arms and ammunition capable of use for both military and other purposes; Category III, vessels of war and their armaments; Category IV, aircraft and aircraft engines; and Category V, gunpowder and explosives, and arms and ammunition of a definitely non-military nature.16. The Convention stipulates that the export of articles falling within Categories I and II shall be permitted only under licence issued by the competent authorities of the exporting countries. As regards Category III, the Convention requires each Government to publish quarterly a return giving certain particulars of each vessel of war constructed for, or transferred to, the Government of another State. The Convention places no restriction on the exportation of articles in Categories IV and V, except when the articles are being sent to the special zones, in which case an export licence is required. In addition to the provisions relating to export licences, there are clauses in the Convention under which comprehensive import and export statistics have to be published at stated intervals. The form the statistics should take is indicated in annexes to the Convention itself.17. This Convention was ratified by His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1930, with the reservation that ratification would not become effective until ratification by the other principal arms-producing States (Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden and U.S.A.) had also become effective in accordance with article 41 of the Convention. Of these States, France, Spain and Sweden have ratified conditionally; the remaining States have not yet ratified.18. The Ethiopian Arms Traffic Treaty, 1930 (Cmd. 3707).-This Treaty, between the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Ethiopia, which was signed m Paris on the 21st August, 1930, applies the provisions of the 1925 Arms Traffic Convention to Abyssinia. It has been ratified by all four countries, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are, therefore, bound by its provisions so far as the export of arms from this country is concerned. Broadly speaking, the effect of the Treaty is that none of the articles covered by &quot; The Arms Export Prohibition Order, 1931,&quot; may be exported to Abyssinia except under the authority of specific export licences, and licences are not issued for articles falling within Categories I, II and IV, unless the application is supported by an import permit issued by the Ethiopian Government. Statistics have to be published by the Governments of the limitrophe territories at stated intervals, showing the imports into and exports from those territories of arms, &amp;c, but no such statistics are required to be published by the Metropolitan countries.APPENDIX (C).Exportation of Arms, &amp;c.

Government to stop export from United Kingdom.Cabinet decision that sale of Government surplus arms to foreign Governments, either direct or through private contractors, should be suspended. In this case the revocation of the licence was a corollary to the above decision.Ditto.Following withdrawal of oil concessions, the War Office advised the Board to recall the licence.

P.A. (33) 3.APPENDIX II.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE PRIVATE ARMAMENTS INDUSTRY.Letter by the Foreign Office on the Recommendations of the Report of the Sub-Committee (Paper No. P.A. (33) 2).W. 7810/G.Sir, Foreign Office, July 20, 1933.I AM directed by His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to refer to the report of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the system of licensing exports of arms and ammunition (see P.S.O. (E.A.) 33, Secret), dated the 23rd June last.2. As the Principal Supply Officers Committee are aware, the essential recommendation of the report is that instead of the specific licences now issued for the export of each separate consignment of arms, there shall in future be issued to manufacturers general licences for the export of arms, subject only to the provision that for every consignment exported under these licences a specific declaration must be made to the Customs eight days before shipment. I am to call attention to the fact that this recommendation runs directly counter to the decision taken by the Cabinet on the 8th February last, when a memorandum and a note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (OP. 23 and 24 (33)), were under con-sideration in connexion with the instructions to be issued to the United Kingdom delegation to the Disarmament Conference in the matter of the trade in and manufacture of arms.3.   The relevant passages in that decision ran as follows : (a) That the United Kingdom delegation at Geneva should continue their opposition to any system of international licences, but&apos; should be authorised to agree to a system of national licences subject to the following conclusions : (d) That we should insist on the inclusion in the Convention of a system of export licences for arms and ammunition such as is already in force in this country.4. It will be within the knowledge of the Principal Supply Officers Committee that this decision was taken to enable the United Kingdom delegation to oppose far-reaching proposals made at Geneva by a number of influential delegations in favour of the abolition of private manufacture and the strict inter-national supervision of the trade in and manufacture of arms. The United Kingdom delegation have strictly conformed themselves to the terms of this decision, and have so far succeeded in resisting proposals of the character just mentioned emanating from other delegations; a reversal of the decision would have the inevitable effect of cutting the ground from under their feet and making it infinitely more difficult to resist measures which have hitherto been considered by the Cabinet absolutely unacceptable.[9373] eSECRET.
5. I am to add that the Secretary of State is convinced that so long as. the Disarmament Conference is still in being, serious difficulties might be caused to His Majesty&apos;s Government by a reversal of their decision on this question, and he considers that when the report is eventually submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence or to the appropriate committee of the Cabinet, the attention of the latter should be drawn to this point. I am to request that you will convey the foregoing observations to the Principal Supply Officers Committee, so that when the report reaches the Cabinet, Ministers should be under no mis-apprehension as to the import of the recommendations of the report.I am, &amp;c. (Signed) A. W. A. LEEPER.The Secretary,Principal Supply Officers Committee, Committee of Imperial Defence.
SECRET.P.A. (33). 5.APPENDIX III.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE PRIVATE ARMAMENTS INDUSTRY.The Export Licensing System and Export Credit Facilities por munitions of War in Foreign Countries.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.MEMBERS of the Committee may wish to know what is the position in foreign countries in regard to the export licensing system and export credit facilities for munitions of war. Accordingly, I have had the attached memoranda prepared by the Board of Trade and the Export Credits Guarantee Department, in consultation with the Foreign Office, and now circulate them for the information of the Committee.W. R.Board of Trade, November 14, 1933.Arms and Ammunition.. Summary of Export Restrictions in Force in certain Foreign Countries. A ustria.Export forbidden under Austrian War Material Law of the 17th January, 1928.Belgium.Exports to the &quot; special zones &quot; defined in 1919 Arms Traffic Convention allowed only under licence (a separate licence for each consignment) issued by the Belgian Proof House at Liege. Exports to other destinations allowed freely, but, under a Decree of the 22nd June, 1933, arms manufactured for export must be registered with the local authorities.Bulgaria.Export forbidden under Bulgarian War Material Law of the 9th January, 1925.Czechoslovakia.No information from League of Nations, but in 1927 the Commercial Counsellor at Prague reported that he was informed by the Ministry of Commerce that a separate licence was necessaiy for the exportation of every consignment of arms and ammunition. Licences were issued by the Police or by the District Political Authority.Denmark.No special authorisation required to manufacture arms or war material and, presumably, no restriction on exports- either.[9373] e 2
France.Information obtained from different sources is conflicting, but, apparently, the export of arms and ammunition not of French service patterns is allowed freely to all destinations except Abyssinia (France is a party to the Ethiopian Arms Traffic Treaty, 1930). Under Article 8 of a law of the 14th August, 1885, exporters of, arms, &amp;c, of French regulation patterns must furnish the Prefect of the Department in which they reside with full particulars of arms to be exported. The Prefect issues a receipt reproducing such particulars, and a duplicate of the receipt serves as an export permit. In a letter addressed by the&apos; French Foreign Office to the British Embassy at Paris on the 23rd May, 1933, it is stated that, in addition to the above, exporters of arms, munitions or war materials must address a request to the Ministry of Finance for an export permit, which is only granted after the Department of Foreign Affairs has been consulted as regards the country of destination and the Ministry of War as regards the nature of the exported material.Germany.Export forbidden under German War Material Law of 27th July, 1927.Greece.Manufacture of arms and implements of war may not be undertaken without a special authorisation from the Ministry of the Interior. No information as to existence of any export restrictions.Hungary.Export forbidden under Hungarian War Material Laws of the 25th February, 1922, and the 25th March, 1927.Italy.Arms, ammunition, military uniforms and other articles intended for the armament and equipment of Jaome, or foreign armed forces may not be exported without an authorisation from the Minister of the Interior. No other arms may be exported without an authorisation from the Quaestor. Separate licences are issued for each consignment, and they are &apos;&apos; revocable at any time at discretion.Japan.Manufacture is prohibited except under licence issued by the competent Administrative Office. Persons or firms so licensed may apparently export freely, but in other cases export is forbidden except under special authorisation issued by the competent Administrative Office.Norway.No special authorisation required to manufacture arms or war material and there is presumably no restriction on exports.Poland.Private manufacture subject to licence. No information about existence of any form of control of exports.Portugal.Manufacture of arms and implements of war is organised in the form of a State monopoly.  No information as to existence of any export restrictions.Roumania.No special authorisation required to manufacture arms, and presumably there are no export restrictions.Spain.Manufacture and sale of arms is subject to close Government supervision under the terms of a Royal Decree of the 4th November, 1929, but there appears to be no export licensing system.
Sweden.No special authorisation required to manufacture arms of war material and. presumably no restriction on exports. .Switzerland. \Exportation of portable firearms and ammunition is subject to licence issued by the Federal military authorities. The licences are issued for an indefinite period, but are subject to revocation for definite reasons, e.g., in case of war.Turkey.Manufacture of arms and implements of war is subject to a State monopoly. No information as to existence of any export restrictions.United States of America.A joint resolution of Congress approved on the 31st January, 1922, provides as follows : &quot; That whenever the President finds that in any American country, or in any country in which the United States exercises extra-territorial juris-diction, conditions of domestic violence exist, which are or may be promoted by the use of arms or ammunitions of war procured from the United States, and makes proclamation thereof, it shall be unlawful to export, except under such limitations and exceptions as the President prescribes, any arms or munitions of war from any place in the United States to such country until otherwise ordered by the President or by Congress.&quot;Under this authority the President has in the past issued proclamations prohibiting export to, e.g., China, Mexico, Honduras and Nicaragua, but so far as is known they have all since been revoked, and none is at present in operation. The proclamations allowed export under specific licences (for specific quantities) . issued by the Department of State at Washington. The licences were valid for four months from date of issue, and were subject to revocation without notice.The use of Export Credit Facilities in Armament Transactions.1. The Overseas Trade Acts, 1920 to 1930, empower the Board of Trade to give guarantees in connexion with the export to any country of goods wholly or partly produced or manufactured in the United Kingdom other than munitions of War.2. So far as the Export Credits Guarantee Department is aware, no foreign Government is prevented by any similar restriction from assisting the sale of armaments by means of export credit facilities provided by the State. On the contrary, it is known in the case of France and Italy that use has been made of such facilities in connexion with armament transactions. Such information as the Department possesses regarding the position in these and other countries interested in the armament trade is summarised in the attached notes, from.which it will be seen that little is known as to the extent to which export credit, guarantees have actually been given for the sale of munitions.3. At the end of November 1932 the Department suggested to the Foreign Office that the British Delegation to the Disarmament Conference should endeavour to persuade all foreign Governments providing credit facilities Tor the encouragement of exports to prohibit the use of such facilities in connexion with the sale of munitions. The Foreign Office were doubtful of the advisability of raising the question at that stage, but instructed the United Kingdom representative on the Sub-Committee dealing with the manufacture of, and trade in, arms to do so if a suitable opportunity occurred. It is-understood that no such opportunity has in fact presented itself, and that no action has therefore been taken at Geneva. &apos; , , t ,Export Credits Guarantee Department, October 24, 1933.
Notes on the Position of Various Foreign Governments in Relation to the use of State Export Credit Facilities in connexion with the Sale of Munitions.France.Mr. Nixon, the Manager of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, was informed in May 1933 by an official of the Ministry of Commerce that the French Government are at liberty to give guarantees where this is in the national interests, i.e., for any goods whatever, provided that they are mainly of French manufacture. The power to give guarantees is limited by law to export transactions between French firms and foreign Governments, departments or public utility companies in States which have concluded treaties, conventions or economic agreements with France. The Ministry of Commerce have discretion to give guarantees for munitions, and have, in fact, done so, but the official quoted above stated that they will not give them in order to facilitate such exports to nations which are actually at war, and that they did not therefore guarantee any sales to either side in the recent conflict between China and Japan.Italy.Royal Decree Law No. 1322/1046 of the 2nd July, 1927, authorises the National Institute of Assurance to guarantee credits &quot;subjected to special risks &quot; and given for &quot; the exportation of national products.&quot; Mr. Nixon was informed in May 1933 by the head of the Italian Credit Insurance Company, which administers the Italian Export Credits Scheme, that they had covered munitions and that, in particular, battleships sold to Turkey had been guaranteed by the Italian Government. It may be, however, that Italian shipbuilders owe their success in competition for foreign orders for warships primarily to other forms of Government Assistance./ apan.The orginal purpose of the Japanese Export Credits Law, which came into force on the 1st August, 1930, was to stimulate exports to regions, such as Central and South America, Africa, the Balkans, Asia Minor and Russia, where Japanese goods were little known. The law applies to the export of goods produced or manufactured in Japan proper, Chosen, Taiwan and Karafuto. According to the Japan Chronicle of the 3rd December, 1931, the Department of Commerce extended the scope of the scheme to the following additional markets : Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Spain, Portugal, Malta, Gibraltar and New Zealand. Towards the end of 1932 it was reported that the scheme was to be extended to all markets, but this measure was apparently shelved, largely owing to the opposition of the Ministry of Finance. In practice the scheme appears to have been used primarily for facilitating exports to Russia; to a smaller extent for trade with Africa and South America. Business with Europe represented, for the years 1930, 1931 and 1932, only an insignificant proportion of the total.Czechoslovakia.On the 24th September, 1931, the Czechoslovak Government issued an ordinance, in which Czechoslovak goods are defined, for purpose of the Export Credits Law of the 16th July, 1931, as goods extracted, cultivated or manufac-tured from local or foreign raw materials from Czechoslovak territory; also such goods produced locally by subjecting to process foreign semi-manufactured goods. Re-exports may also be insured when they do not compete with similar goods of Czechoslovak origin. During the year ended July 1932, 95 per cent, of the guarantees given related to trade with Russia.Sweden.Royal Decree No. 429 of the 26th June, 1933, authorises the granting of Government guarantees in respect of credits given by Swedish exporters for the sale abroad of native products of industry, agriculture or fishing.
Poland. .By a Presidential Decree, dated the 27th February, 1931, a State export fund was created to assist the export &quot; of all kinds of local agricultural and industrial produce.&quot; The fund may be used not only for guaranteeing payments by foreign purchasers, but also for the granting of credits for the &quot; purposes of production or trade earmarked for exports.&quot;Belgium.Arret6 Royal of the 18th October, 1921, set out the conditions on which guarantees might be given in connexion with the export of Belgian products under a law dated the 7th August, 1921. It is provided that such goods must have been wholly or partly manufactured in Belgium or its colonies, or, in the case of raw materials, where the needs of national industry are secured.Board of Trade, November 14, 1933.o
