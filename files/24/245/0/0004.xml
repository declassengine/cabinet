E C R E T.a?0  384 (55).COPY NO,CABINET.REPORT OF THE INDIAN DEFENCE TRIBUNAL. JOINT MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUERAND THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.Is The question of the contributions made by India, tocover the cost of raising,  training and equipping British troops and RIAaF.  personnel for service in India, known as the Capitation Rates, has been before the Cabinet on several occasions since the War.      The War Office and the Air Ministry have claimed that the payments made by India were inadequate;     the Government of India have maintained that the payments should be abolished and that a contribution ought to be made from British revenues towards the cost of India&apos;s defence expenditure.2. The dispute was last considered by the Cabinet on13th February 1929,  (Cabinet 6(29) Conclusion 3) and, after discussion,  it was then decided that the whole basis of the Capitation payments,  including both the War Office claims and the counter-claims of the Government of India,  should be deferred immediately to an independent tribunal and that the Secretary of State for India should ascertain whether the Government of India were prepared to abide by the decision of the  tribunal.&apos;3. Negotiations took place between the various departments concerned and the Terms of Reference of the tribunal were agreed.      The Government of India expressed their willingness to abide by the decision of the tribunal if the British Government were equally willing to be so bound.-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).
The setting-up of the tribunal was postponed first,- pending., the issue of the Report of the Indian Statutory Commission, which was known to be considering questions relating to IndiaTs defence from both the political and financial points of view, and next owing to the calling of the Indian Round Table Conference.4. In January, 1931, Mr.  Snowden because of the wider basis which India &apos;s claim for an Imperial constitution had assumed, objected on behalf of the Treasury to the remission of issues of such financial magnitude for the final decision of an outside body, holding that the function of the independent body should be to enquire into the facts and advise thereon, both Governments reserving their constitutional right to consider its recommendations.    He considered that the appointment of a tribunal should be expressly stated to be subject to that condition.5. The Government of India accepted this view and eventually the tribunal was constituted as follows, and appointed by the Prime Minister.Chairman. Sir RoR. Garran, K.C., K.C.M.G.Members.nated by Majesty!s rnment,nated by rnment of a.(Rt.Hon. Viscount .uunedin, P.C. , G.C.V.O, (Rt.Hon. Lord Tomlin,  P.C.(Hon.  Sir Shadi Lai, Kt0(Hon.  Sir Shah Muhammad Sulaiman, Kt.with the following Terms of Reference:-Head (l) To consider and report whether there shouldcontinue to be contributions by India towards the recruiting and training expenses at home of the British Army in India;    and to report the basis on which the contributions, if continued, should be calculated.Head (S) To examine India&apos;s claim that a contribution should be made from Imperial revenues towards military expenditure from Indian revenues,  and to report the basis on which any contribution approved should be assessed.
Head (5)  To examine the War Office claim that India-should--pay a direct contribution towards the cost of the Regular and Supplementary Reserves, and to report the basis on which any contribution approved should be assessedoHead (4) To consider whether the Sea Transport Contributionpaid by the War Office to India should be continued or.....modified after 31st March, 1933.Head (5) To examine and report mutatis mutandis on such of the questions raised in the preceding paragraphs as are relevant to the contribution at present paid from Indian revenues in respect of Royal Air Force personnel in India.So The Tribunal met in November 1932.    Written cases were submitted by all three Departments and explained by Counsel. Mr. Wilfrid Greene, K.C., Mr.   (now Sir) D.B.  Somervell, K.C., and Mr. Wilfrid Lewis appearing on behalf of the War Office and Air Ministry and Mr,  Gavin Simonds,    K.C., Mr.  P.D. Morton, K.C., and Sir J.B. Kanga on behalf of the Government of India. 7. The Report of the tribunal was presented to the PrimeMinister in January, 1933.    The Tribunal were not in every case unanimous in their recommendations.    On Heads 1 and 5 the Tribunal recommended that the Capitation Rates should continue and proposed the basis on which they should be calculated.8. The Tribunal were not agreed as to the length of training for which India should be charged,  a minority proposing 6 months, the majority 9 months.    Otherwise the recommendations on thetraining charges were unanimous.    The effect of these recommenda-tions, which the Departments concerned will find no difficulty in translating into a working arrangement, will be to reduce slightly India&apos;s liability under these heads below the payments that have been made provisionally on account since April, 1926. 9. On Head 3 the Tribunal recommended unanimously that no contribution should be made by India to the cost of the general Army Reserve and in regard to the War Office claim in respect of Reserves specifically maintained for India,  said that the decision might depend on the nature of the provision made and the extent of assurance given by the Imperial authorities that India should have first call on any Reserves specifically maintained for her.    They did not think that the question had arisen in a form that enabled them to make a definite recommendation and could only advise that at the present stage of the dispute  the claim in the form in whichit was presented should not be allowed.-3-
10,    On Head   4 the majority recommended that the Sea Transport Contribution at present paid by the War Office should be continued.11.    In considering India&apos;s claim to a contribution under Head 2.. ,  the Tribunal dismissed certain considerations (i.e. a claim to generous treatment,   the dependent position of India, political sentiment in India regarding military expenditures disproportionate amount of revenues expended on defence,  and capacity to pay)  advanced by the Government of India in support of their claim on the ground that these were questions of policy irrelevant to  the task imposed on them.    They considered India&apos;s claim to be based mainly on the following groundss-(l)    that the Army in India serves an Imperial as well as an Indian purpose,  and is always available, and sometimes used,  for purposes other than the defence of India;(S)    that other parts of the Empire do not contribute to the same extent to the defence    of the Empire?(3)    that the Imperial Government has a prominent voice in determining the cost and organisation of the Army in India. 12.    The V/ar Office case was that India should assume responsibility for the &quot;minor danger&quot; of the maintenance of internal security and the defence of India against the border tribes and Afghanistan,  and that Great Britain should assume responsibility for the &quot;major danger&quot; of attack by a great Power upon India or upon the Empire through India,  and  the Expeditionary Force.    The majority of the Tribunal accepted the War Office view as to the dvision   of responsibility, but the Tribunal nevertheless unanimously recommended that a contribution should be made
from Imperial revenues towards military--expenditure from Indian revenues.    The majority of the Committee considered that  the grounds in respect of which the contribution should be made were two only(i)    that  the Army in India is a force ready in an emergency tot ake the field at once which does not exist elsewhere in the Empire, which is specially available for immediate use in the East and whi^h has,  on occasions been so used,  and(2) that India is a training ground for active service such as does not exist elsewhere in the Empire.The minority considered that other grounds should be taken into account.13.    The Tribunal were unable to place the amount of the contribution to be made from Imperial revenues to India on an arithmetical basis but suggested it should be fixed in relation to the grounds on which it was recommended it should be paid.    We have with the assistance of the Secretary of State for War given the gravest consideration to the assessment of this contribution. 14.    We new recommend to the Cabinet the following comprehensive terms of settlement;(l)    that on points on which, the Tribunal were not unanimous the majority recommendations should be accepted $(2)    that with effect from 1st April,  1933,  an annual contribution of l  million pounds should be made from Imperial Revenues to the Government of India towards the cost of India&apos;s defence expenditure,  this amount to include the sum of  130,000 at present payable by
the War Office under head  4   - Sea Transport -subsidy;,________-&apos;.(3)    that with effect from 1st April,  1933,   the pay-ments to he made by India In respect of the Capitation Rates should be calculated in accordance with the recommendations of the tribunal;(4)    that all arrears between the Departments connected&apos; with these matters up to 1st April,  1933,   should he cancelled;(5)    that the India Office and War Office should co-operate in submitting,  for the consideration of the Committee of Imperial Defence the military question whether a reserve should be specifically maintained in England for India.(6)    that the Report of the Tribunal slightly amended for purposes of publication as e xpiained in a foreword551 together with the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government on it should be published simultaneously in the United Kingdom and in India at an early date;(7)    that  the contribution of Ig- millions should be shewn as a grant in aid on the India Office Vote.(intld.)

Foreword to proposed White Paper.The text of the Report of the Indian Defence Expenditure Tribunal published in the following pages differs in some respects from that actually submitted by the Tribunal and considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government.In two places in the Report signed by all members of the Tribunal His Majesty&apos;s Government have found it necessary, for reasons of military policy,  to alter slightly the original wording, but this has been done without in any way modifying the original significance.It has also not been found possible to publish in extenso the Notes by Sir Shadi Lai and Sir Shah Muhamraed Sulaiman (nos..  1 and 2 respectively) on the question of an Imperial military contribution, in view of the discussion therein of certain matters in the sphere of military policy and foreign relations-      The brief summaries of these Notes which have been substituted are accepted by the two Members concerned as conveying the purport of their respective Notes.
