THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1933.SECRET. Copy No.  40CP. 295 (33).CABINET.FALKLAND ISLANDS DEPENDENCIES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.FOR a number of years past considerable sums have been expended on a series of investigations, principally in the Antarctic area, carried out by the &quot;Discovery&quot; Committee. That Committee was appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1923 to carry out the researches recommended by an Inter-Departmental Committee whose report was published in 1920 (Cmd. 657). The investigations are predominantly connected with whaling, though other work (e.g., in connection with sealing, coastal surveys, &amp;c.) has been authorised -and undertaken..2. The &quot;Discovery&quot; investigations are financed from the Falkland Islands Dependencies Research and Development Fund, which has been built up from the proceeds of taxation imposed on whaling and sealing enterprises operating in South Georgia and other Dependencies of the Falkland Islands.3. On the 1st October, 1933, the balance of the Fund stood at  375,000 * and the balance on the 31st December, 1933, is expected to be about  360,000*4. The charges oh the Dependencies Research and Development Fund are now exceeding its income. The yield of revenue from the Dependencies has also fallen below the cost of administering them, the deficiency for the year 1932 being  2,698 (revenue  17,446; expenditure.  20,144). A deficiency of about  5,000 is anticipated for the year 1933. The time has accordingly arrived when it is prudent to review the situation generally, and especially the question of setting aside a part of the Fund as a reserve for purely Dependencies expenditure. This raises the question of placing some limit on the extent to which the Fund can be drawn upon for the continuance of the &quot; Discovery &quot; investigations.5. At the same time I have given careful consideration to a more important and more difficult and controversial question, namely, whether some part of the Fund could not advantageously be made available for other research work which might be expected to produce scientific results of greater importance to the Empire as a whole, e.g., the maintenance of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad, and of the East African Agricultural Research Station, Amani.6. On this latter question, having in mind explanations given to the whaling industry in the past, 1 thought it desirable to consult the Law Officers of. the Crown. Copies of the Reference to the Law Officers and of their Report are appended (Appendices &quot;A&quot; and &quot; B &quot;). The former document summarises the past history of the Fund and deals with the question of possible diplomatic issues* These, figures are derived from accounts giving the investments ( 250,01)0) at cost. About  30.000 should be added ii the investments be reckoned at cunent market prices.
arising out of alleged &quot; pledges&apos;&apos; to foreign whaling interests. It will be seen that the Law Officers have advised i: .(i) that, under the terms of the Ordinance of 1924, it is not permissible to expend any part of the balance now standing to the credit of the Fund on any purposes unconnected with the Dependencies; (ii) that the diversion of any part of the Fund by means of a new Ordinance to such objects as those suggested would lead in due course to diplomatic representations;(iii) that.it was not their opinion &quot; that a good, that is to say, as we under-stand the question, a valid legal claim could be made against the Crown,&quot; since the &quot;pledges&quot; to the whaling interests, however binding in honour, are not and do not take the form of a contract, and cannot be made to support a claim for damages for breach of contract;(iv) that they were &apos;&apos; unaware of any precedent for the suggestion that achange of internal policy, even if the application of a fund raised by taxation is involved, can be treated as a breach of international law &quot;; and(v) that, in the absence of the disclosure of a similar case (as to which they suggested an investigation of Foreign Office records), they considered that &quot;no international obligation is involved or has been broken.&quot; As 1&apos;egards this last point, the suggested investigation has been made into the Foreign Office records without revealing any case in international law sufficiently analogous to serve as a precedent.7. The easy and simple course is to let sleeping dogs lie, avoid all diplomatic representations, and leave the &quot; Discovery &quot; Committee free to exhaust the whole of this large fund less the amount I propose to set aside for a Dependencies Reserve Fund (see paragraph 10 below). But on merits I think this would be wrong. The Committee have already spent upwards of  690,000 (capital expendi-ture  259,000 and recurrent expenditure  431,000), without achieving comparable results. I have discussed the position with them at length. Their aim is to accumulate sufficient evidence of the birth, life and death of whales as will induce the whaling countries to agree upon an international convention to control whaling in the Southern seas; a convention which I imagine it would be very difficult to enforce. They admit, however, that in spite of all they have done up to now, the whaling interests and the countries concerned show no inclination to. bind themselves. Nor is there any assurance that when the fund is exhausted the evidence will be very much more conclusive or the prospect of international agree-ment much.more likely. This being so, I feel bound to ask my colleagues whether we ought not to try to salve some part of this fund for Colonial research of much greater importance. The &quot;Discovery&quot; Committee naturally want to keep the whole fund; although I found Sir Fortescue Flannery inclined to regard as reasonable the compromise I proposed. Scientists as well as capitalists (and ,others), cling to vested interests. But I am not proposing to rob this hen roost for any gross purpose; but to transfer some of the eggs to more promising scientific nests.8. The proposition then to which I would invite the Cabinet to assent in principle is that a part only of the Fund should be regarded as available for meeting the cost of further investigations by the &apos;&apos; Discovery &apos;&apos; Committee; and that, of the remainder, sums should be set aside (a) to form a reserve fund for the future needs of the Dependencies, and (b) to meet the cost of research work more valuable to the Colonial Empire than that upon which the &apos;&apos; Discovery&apos;&apos; Committee are engaged.9. I have quite recently authorised the &quot; Discovery&quot; Committee to under-take certain further investigations, involving the recommissioning of the &quot;Discovery II&quot; for one more voyage of about twenty months&apos; duration. For the completion of these investigations, I would propose to allow expenditure to a maximum of  125,000 after the end of 1933. This sum will cover the expenses of the voyage, and leave a margin to meet the cost of working up the material collected, publishing the results of the series of investigations, and generally winding up the affairs of the &quot; Discovery &quot; Committee.    . .
* For the specific purpose of (inincing the researches recommended by, the Inter-Departmental Committee mention d in the first para raph of fch s memorandum. &apos; . -t Or t&apos;130,000 if the investments be valued .t currst.it market prices. .&apos;. .10. 1 With regard to the provision of a reserve fund for the Falkland Islands Dependencies, the position is that no separate Reserve Fund for the Dependencies has been maintained for some years past. The Dependencies Research and Development Fund already possesses some of the characteristics of such a fund, since it was credited in 1924 (on its inauguration) with a transfer of  15,493 from a Dependencies General Account. Moreover, the Fund has subsequently been credited in each year, with one exception, with the entire surplus of the revenue over the expenditure of the Dependencies, and not merely the extra revenue obtained from the special increases in taxation imposed as from the year 1919.* The exception was the year 1932, when a sum of  6,302 transferable to the Fund was held over to meet an anticipated shortage of Dependencies revenue in 1933. My view is that the sum to be ear-marked for future expenditure directly connected with the Dependencies should be of an amount to produce an annual income in the region of  5,000, or approximately the anticipated deficit for the year 1933. This adverse balance, it may be explained, is unlikely to be redressed for some years to come, since there have been changes in the methods of whaling which, by virtually eliminating shore stations, have reduced to a very low figure what was once an important source of revenue. The Dependencies provide no employment other than the whaling and sealing industries, and have no non-official population apart from persons engaged in those industries; but, so long as any bases are maintained there for whaling or sealing operations, it will be necessary to retain some form of British administration. This will neces-sarily entail recurrent expenditure on communications, &amp;c, on a comparatively heavy scale, for which some financial provision willhave to be made. In the circumstances I propose to reserve, as from the 1st January, 1934, a sum of not less than  135,000 as a provision for future expenditure directly connected with the Dependencies. ...11. There would thus remain a sum of  100,000, t which I would propose to divert to other research purposes, such as those indicated at the end of paragraphs above. My view is that public interests would be best served by utilising, this money as the nucleus of a new fund, to be given some such title as the &quot; Colonial Research Fund &quot; and to be placed at the disposalof the Secretary of State for the Colonies for employment in aid of such activities as he may from time to time decide to be of the greatest general value to the Colonial Empire as a whole. The need for such a fund is a very real one; there are various research institutions connected with the Colonies engaged upon work of pronounced economic value, whose activities are handicapped at the present time by lack of funds. The disappearance of the Empire Marketing Board, which was a generous contributor to such institutions, has rendered the position still more acute. It would be of the utmost advantage if a central fund were available from which the most pressing needs of Colonial research work could from time to time receive assistance.12. To sum up my proposal is to allot (1)  125,000 for the completion of the &quot;Discovery&quot; investigations; (2)  135,000 for the future needs of the Dependencies; (3)  100,000 for a new Research Fund. Local legislation will, of course, be required if the above proposals are to be carried into effect.13. There is one consideration of some weight which I ought perhaps to mention. As my colleagues perhaps know, our rights over the Falkland Islands and the Dependencies are challenged by the Argentine Government. This affords an argument against allowing all signs of British administration to disappear from the Dependencies. If that were to happen, the Argentine pretensions might become much more difficult to rebut.(Initialled) P. C.-L.Downing Street,December 11, 1933.
APPENDIX A,&apos;, &apos; * - Colonial Office to Law Officers.Gentlemen.. Downing Street, July 18, 1933.I AM directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to state that he desires to submit to you certain questions with regard to the future utilization of monies standing to the credit of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Research and Development Fund. A list of the relevant documents, copies of which are enclosed, is attached.2. By Letters Patent dated the 21st July, 1908, the Dependencies of the Colony of the Falkland Islands were defined to be &quot; the groups of islands known as South Georgia, the South Orkneys, the South Shetlands, and the Sandwich Islands, and the territory known as Graham &apos;s Land,. situated in the South Atlantic Ocean to the south of the fiftieth parallel of South latitude, and lying between the twentieth and the eightieth degrees of West longitude.&quot; By Letters Patent dated the 28th March, 1917, the Dependencies were declared &quot; to include and to have included all islands and territories whatsoever between the twentieth degree of West longitude and the fiftieth degree of West longitude which are situated south of the fiftieth parallel of South latitude; and all islands and territories whatsoever between the fiftieth degree of West longitude and the eightieth degree of West longitude which are situated south of the fifty-eighth parallel of South latitude.&quot; Laws for these Dependencies are made by the Governor of the Falkland Islands with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council of the Colony.3. British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and certain of the Dependencies is challenged by the Argentine Government, who also claim sovereignty over the islands.4. Between 1905 and 1912, revenue from the Dependencies was principally obtained from import duties, rents of land sites for whaling purposes, and fees for whaling licences.5. Commencing with the 1912-13 whaling season, an export duty on whale oil was introduced, the rate being 3d. per barrel (40 gallons) -Ordinance No. 1 of 1912. Notice of the intention to impose this taxation was given to the whaling companies then operating in the Dependencies, by circular letters from . the Falkland Islands Government dated the 29th January, 1912, and the 1st February, 1912. The letter of the 29th January, 1912, was addressed to leaseholders in South Georgia, and the letter of the 1st February, 1912, was sent to licensees in the other Dependencies.6. During 1915 the rate of duty was raised from 3d. to 3\d. per barrel (Ordinance No. 3 of 1915) and an export duty on guano was introduced (Ordinance No. 7 of 1915). The duty on guano (of all kinds) was fixed at \\d. for every 100 lb. or part thereof.7. In 1918 (Ordinance No. 6 of 1918) an export duty on seal oil was added, the rate being the same as for whale oil, viz., 3\d. per barrel.8. During 1919 (Ordinance No. 3 of 1919) the export duties on whale oil and seal oil were increased to Is. Qd. a barrel, and in 1920 (Ordinance No. 5 of 1920) the rate was raised to 5s. a barrel. A refund of 2s. Qd. a barrel was authorized for the seasons 1920-21 (Ordinance No. 4 of 1921), 1926-27 (Ordinance No. 5 of 1928) and 1927-28 (Ordinance No. 5 of 1928). For the seasons 1921-22 1925-26, refunds were authorized in accordance with a sliding scale, the rate of refund varying with the average market price realized for first-grade oil. For the seasons 1928-29 1931-32, the duty was fixed at the rate of 2s. a barrel, the system of refunds being discontinued. For the 1932-33 season the rate was lowered to Is. 6^. a barrel.9. The increases from 3\d. to Is. Qd. and thereafter to 5s. were explained to the whaling interests (including Norwegian and Argentine concerns) in a letter of the 7th May, 1920, a copy of which is enclosed. Protests followed, and copies of the more important replies are enclosed.
10. The Inter-Departmental Committee referred to in this correspondence was appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1918, with the following terms of reference : &quot; To consider what can now be done to facilitate prompt-action at the conclusion of the War in regard to the preservation of the whaling industry and to the development of other industries in the Dependencies of the Falkland Islands; and to consider not only the economic questions above referred to, and the scheme for the employment of a research vessel, but also what purely scientific investigations are most required in connexion with these regions, and whether any preliminary enquiries by experts in this country could be instituted.&quot;The Report of that Committee was presented in August 1919, and published in April 1920 (Cmd. 657). The programme of investigations recommended by the Committee is summarized in paragraph 156 of the Report, a copy of which is enclosed.11. When authority was given in 1919 for the rate of duty to be raised from 3\d. to Is. Qd., directions were also given, by the Secretary of State to the Governor, that the extra revenue should be carried to a separate fund. A Dependencies Research Fund was accordingly opened, and on the 1st January, 1924, its balance stood at  300,301 15s. 3d. On the same date the balance of the Dependencies General Account stood at  15,493 0s. 4d.12. By Ordinance No. 6 of 1924 (copy enclosed) a new Fund was created, under the title of &quot; The Dependencies Research and Development Fund.&quot; To this Fund was transferred the balances from the two funds referred to in the preceding paragraph, viz., (a) the Dependencies Research Fund and (b) the Dependencies General Account. It was also provided that the new Fund was to be credited with the excess of revenue over expenditure of the Dependencies at the end of each financial year.13.   Section 2 of the Ordinance No. 6 of 1924 laid down that the new Fund was to be established for the following purposes : (a) research in connexion with the whaling industry and any purposesincidental thereto;(b) the development of the resources of the Dependencies and research inconnexion therewith and any purposes incidental thereto; and(c) such other purposes as the Governor may with the consent of theLegislative Council and the sanction of the Secretary of State from time to time direct.This Ordinance was passed by the Legislative Council on the 22nd December, 1924, and on the same day the following Resolution was adopted by the Council: &quot; Whereas it is provided in Section 2 of the Dependencies Research and Development Fund Ordinance, 1924, that the Fund shall be established for certain specified purposes and also for such other purposes as the Governor may &apos; with the consent of the Legislative Council and the sanction of the Secretary of State, from time to time, direct.&apos;&quot;Be it now resolved that the purposes for which the Research and Development Fund is established be held to include all the researches, whether immediately recommended or not, referred to in the Report of the Inter-departmental Committee on Research and Development in the Dependencies of the Falkland Islands which was presented to Parliament by Command of His Majesty in April 1920 (Cmd. 657).&quot; :14. The researches undertaken under the authority of the foregoing-Resolution have taken the form of a series of investigations, principally in the Antarctic area, carried out by the &quot; Discovery &quot; Committee, a body appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1923. For a number of years.the income of the Dependencies Research and Development Fund more than sufficed to meet all charges in connexion with these investigations, including the cost of. the headquarters staff in London. Since 1931, however-as a result not only of&apos; the economic depression but also of the new &quot; pelagic &quot; method of whaling, which.&apos;
virtually eliminates the use of shore stations-the amounts received in export duty have been seriously reduced; and as a consequence the charges on the Fund have exceeded the income.   The balance nOw stands at approximately  380,000.15. Funds are urgently required for purposes of scientific research, &amp;o, which are of the highest importance to the Empire as a whole, e.g., the maintenance of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad, and of the East African Agricultural Research Station, Amani. . The work of such institutions is, in the Secretary of State&apos;s opinion, likely to produce scientific results of much greater value than the continuance of the &quot;Discovery&quot; Committee programme; and it would, he considers, be definitely to the public advantage if some at least of the monies now standing to the credit of the Dependencies Research and Development Fund could be made available for their support.16. Having regard to the foreign interests involved, Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister thought it desirable to refer to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs before directing me to address this communication to you. A copy of the reply received from the Foreign Office is enclosed herewith.17.   Sir Philip Cunli fe-Lister would be glad if you would take the fore-foing, and the enclosed papers, into consideration at an early date and advise im: (1) Whether, by virtue of paragraph (c) of Section 2 of the Falkland Islands Ordinance No. 6 of 1924, it is permissible to expend a. part of the balance of  380,000 now standing to the credit of the Dependencies Research and Development Fund on purposes not ejusdem generis as those specified in paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) of that section?(2) If the answer to (1) is (a) in the affirmative, or(b) in the negative,  and a further Ordinance were passedamending Ordinance No. 6 of 1924 in such a way as to make such expenditure permissible,and part of the said balance were so expended, whether, having regard to the terms of the letters numbered III, IV and VI to X on the attached list, the foreign interests concerned would have a good claim against the Crown, or, alternatively, whether the foreign Govern-ments concerned would be able to establish a breach of international law against His Majesty&apos;s Government upon which a diplomatic claim could be founded ?(3) Generally.I am, &amp;c.G.

The ejusdem generis rule of interpretation hardly seems to us to throw much light on the scope of paragraph (c)-of Section 2 of Ordinance No. 6 of 1924. The function of the Governor and the Legislative Council with the sanction of the Secretary of State is to select &apos;&apos; such other purposes &apos;&apos; as they may decide, and provided the purposes are &quot; for the Dependencies &quot; we do not regard paragraphs (a) and (b) as in any way limiting the choice of &quot; purposes.&quot; We attach much more importance to the long title of the Ordinance and to what we regard as the obvious intention of the Ordinance, particularly having regard to paragraph 3 (c), namely, an intention to use the fund so as to promote the interests of the Dependencies.Having regard to the explicit terms of the letters mentioned in the second question submitted to us, and particularly letters VI and VIII, we entertain no doubt at all that the diversion of any part of this fund by means of a new Ordinance to the proposed or similar objects would lead in due course to diplomatic representations. We do not think that a good, that is to say, as we understand the question, a valid legal claim could be made against the Crown. However binding in honour the letters may be, they are not and they do not take the form of a contract, and they cannot be made to support a claim for damages for breach of contract. So far as international law is concerned, we are unaware of any precedent for the suggestion that a change of internal policy, even if the application of a fund raised by taxation is involved, can be treated as a breach of international law. Any claim would depend upon the question whether the subject of the country putting forward the claim could be said to have been treated in a manner incompatible with any international obligation. In the absence of the disclosure of a similar the result of an investigation of the records of the Foreign Office, we should say that no international obligation is involved or has been broken. &quot;We have, &amp;c.T.

Annexure IV to Appendix A-The Office of the Colonial Secretary, (No. 57/1912.) Stanley, Falkland Islands,Sir, February 1, 1912.I AM directed by the Governor to enclose a copy of the Whaling Regulations, 1912, giving the conditions under which licences will be issued for the coming season, and also a draft Bill, which will explain to you the restrictions it is intended to impose on the use of floating-factories and. vessels for towing whale carcases, after the 30th September, 1912.2.   With regard to the issue of floating-factory licences, I am to explain that it is not intended to authorise the operation of any floating-factory (except under lease or whaling licence) after the 30th September, 1913, nor after the .30th September, 1912, except on special grounds being shown.   A fee of  100 i i will be charged for any floating-factory licence issued for the season 1912-13 upon special grounds.- 3. It has also been decided to extend to the Dependencies the provisions of the Tariff Ordinance of this Colony, and to amend that Ordinance so as to provide for an export duty of 3d. a barrel (i.e., Is. Qd. a ton), on all whale oil.4. : His Excellency would be glad to receive from you any suggestions as to how the revenue thus obtained could most advantageously be spent for the benefit of the whaling industry in the Dependency in which your Company is operating.I am, &amp;c.Colonial Secretary.The Office of the Colonial Secretary, (No. 57/1912.) Stanley, Falkland Islands,V - January 29, 1912.I AM directed by the Governor to enclose for your information a copy of a draft Bill which will explain to you the restrictions on the use of floating-factories and vessels for towing Whale carcases, which it is proposed to bring into force on the 1st October, 1912.2. With regard to the issue of floating-factory licences, I am to explain that it is not intended to authorise the operation of any floating-factory (except under lease or whaling licence) after the 30th September, 1913, nor after the 30th September, 1912, except on special grounds being shown. Should you desire, for any special reason, to employ an additional floating-factory, you should apply, at your earliest convenience, for a floating-factory licence, stating such special reason or reasons in your application. A fee of  100 will be charged for any floating-factory licence issued for the season 1912-13 upon special grounds.3. I am also to inform you that it is the intention of the Government to make Grytviken Harbour, South Georgia, a Port of Entry, from the 1st October, 1912, and at the same time to extend to that Dependency the provisions of the Tariff and Customs Ordinances of this Colony.It has likewise been decided to amend the Tariff Ordinance so as to provide for an export duty of 3d. a barrel (i.e., Is. Qd. a ton) on all whale oil.4. From the revenue thus obtained the Government propose to erect a wireless Telegraph Station at South Georgia; place an Acetylene Light on a site to be selected hereafter, to facilitate the approach of vessels making the Dependency from the North-West; build suitable quarters for the Stipendiary Magistrate and his Staff, as well as a Custom Shed and other necessary buildings; and to grant a subsidy for the regular carriage of mails between South Georgia and Buenos Aires.5. His Excellency would be glad to receive any observations you may wish to make upon the measures suggested in the last paragraph.I am, &amp;c.Colonial Secretary.
Annexure VII to Appendix A.(57477/20)Gentlemen, Downing Street, December 1, 1920.I AM directed by Lord Milner to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th November, regarding the increase of the duty on Whale Oil produced in the Dependencies of the Falkland Islands; and to inform you that the decision of the local Legislature to increase the duty was taken after careful consideration of all the circumstances by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that His MajestyJs Government is not prepared to recommend any variation of that decision, ihsaul I am, &amp;c.(Signed) G. GRINDLE.The Association of Whaling Companies.If     -1 Annexure VIII to Appendix A.(2422/21)Gentlemen, Downing Street, February 7, 1921.I AM directed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th January, regarding the export duty on whale oil produced in the Dependencies of the Falkland Islands.; 2. As you are awere, the duty has been increased in order to provide a fund from which the expense of certain projects highly desirable in the interests of the preservation and development of the resources of the Dependencies can be defrayed. Lord Milner is not satisfied that the increase is beyond the ability of the industry to pay, and in these circumstances he does not think that there are sufficient grounds for revising the rate of duty for the coming season.I am, &amp;c.-Lli (Signed) G. GRINDLE.Messrs. Chr. Salvesen and Company.(21800/20)Gentlemen; Downing Street, May 7, 1920,.W1TH reference to the letter from this Department of the 26th April forwarding a copy of the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Research and Development in the Dependencies of the Falkland Islands, I am directed by Lord Milner to invite your attention to the recommendation in paragraph 154 of the Report that increased revenue should be obtained from the Whaling and Sealing. Industries in the Dependencies to meet the cost of the proposed investigations, which are primarily concerned with the preservation of the Whaling Industry.2. The export duty on whale and seal oil was raised from 3\d. to Is. %d. &apos; a barrel:as from the 1st October, 1919, and the additional revenue so derived is being placed to the Credit of a special fund for Research and Development in the Dependencies. In view of the high prices now realised for oil, Lord Milner is. satisfied that a further substantial increase in the duty is justifiable, and he has accordingly authorised the Officer Administering the Government of the Falkland Islands to take steps to increase the duty on whale and seal oil to 5s. a barrel as from the 1st October next.

.Sir, Foreign Office, July 5, 1933...V WITH reference to your letter 19232/33 of the 26th June, regarding the question of the future utilisation of monies standing to the credit of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Research and Development Fund, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to offer, for the consideration of Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, the following observations.2. The only legal aspects of this question which concern the Foreign Office are those relating to the possibility of certain foreign Governments being able to establish a claim under international law against His Majesty&apos;s Government. The claim, if any, would be one relating to the treatment by His Majesty&apos;s Government and/or the Administration of the Falkland Islands of certain foreign whaling companies, nationals of the foreign Government concerned; consequently, any such claim would fall within the scope of the general rule with regard to the exhaustion of municipal remedies, and would only arise on the hypothesis that the foreign companies concerned had no remedy open to them under the municipal law of the Falkland Islands or this country.3. The question of the payment of these export duties on whale oil, &amp;c, exported from the Falkland Islands and Dependencies is not the subject of any relevant treaty provisions, and there is no diplomatic correspondence between His Majesty&apos;s Government and foreign Governments which is materially relevant to this question. Consequently, the claim by foreign Governments must be based upon the general principles of international law and Upon the contention that the treatment accorded in this matter to these foreign companies is contrary to the general principles of justice or, as it is sometimes put, treatment falling below the general international standard. It would appear that any claim would have to be based upon grounds substantially as follows: His Majesty&apos;s Government and/or the Administration of the Falkland Islands had undertaken by assurances given to the whaling companies (in particular, documents No. VI and X) that the proceeds of this high export duty on whale oil would, in whole or in great measure, be devoted to certain research and other purposes directly &quot;beneficial to the whaling companies, by whom the duties were paid, and this undertaking has been broken by the diversion of the proceeds to other purposes, in which the whaling companies have no interest whatever.4. In Order to establish any such claim, it would, it is thought, be necessary to show that the foreign whaling companies in question had dOhe or forborne to do something of substantial importance on account of these assurances. His Majesty&apos;s Government, as the Sovereign Power in the Falkland Islands and its Dependencies, are entitled to impose there such export duties oh Whale oil as they may deem fit, and to devote the proceeds of the export duties to such purposes as may seem good to them. Foreign companies, if they choose to export whale oil from the territory, must pay whatever export duties are imposed by law, and to whatever purposes the proceeds of these duties are devoted.5. It appears, then, that a pecuniary claim likely to be upheld by an inter-hational tribunal could only be made out in this case if it could be shown that the foreign whaling companies in question would have abstained from making use of the Falkland Islands for the purposes of their operations if the prpceeds of tax in question had gone into the general funds of the Colony instead of being devoted to this research work. In the circumstances it seems unlikely that this could be established, but this is a question of fact upon which Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister has more information than is possessed by this department. If, however, it could be established, it is possible (though Sir John Simon is not to be taken as expressing the opinion that the tribunal would hold this view) that an inter-national tribunal would hold that the breach of the undertaking was a delinquency under. international law: Even if a claim were held to lie, Sir John Simon considers that the measure of damages could be only the loss which the companies could show they had suffered owing to the failure to devote the proceeds of the tax to research work. The exact point, however, is a somewhat novel one, and certain research would have to be undertaken in this department before Sir John Simon could say whether the records of the Foreign Office disclose the existence of any other international case with sufficiently close analogy to the present one. If Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister desires, or if the Law Officers should desire it, Sir John Simon will cause an investigation to be made into this matter.
13 1116. I am to conclude with two observations of a.political, rather than a legal, character, namely : (a) That, even assuming there is no legal ground upon which any foreign Government could found any diplomatic claim, there does appear to have been something in the nature of a moral obligation upon His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the companies who paid the duty, and it is possible that representations with regard to the matter might be received from the Governments to which the foreign companies belong, to which it might be necessary to return an answer, even if nothing in the nature of a legal claim were made.(&amp;) That, as the reference to the Law Officers shows, the Argentine Republic disputes the claim of sovereignty of His Majesty&apos;s Government over the Falkland Islands and some of its Dependencies, and that while His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that His Majesty&apos;s title to this territory is well-founded, it is the general policy of the Foreign Office as far as possible to avoid contentious questions with foreign Governments connected with this territory.7. Finally, I am to return to you herewith the enclosures in your letter of the 26th June, and to suggest for the consideration of Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, that a copy of this letter might be included in the documents to be submitted to the Law Officers.I am, &amp;c.A.
