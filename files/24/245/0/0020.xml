THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJB8TVS GOVERNMENTPrinted, for the Cabinet.  December 1933.SECRET, Copy No.    37CP. 300 (33).CABINET.COLONIAL GOVERNORS&apos; PENSIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I DESIRE to lay before my colleagues for their consideration certain anomalies which result from the existing provisions for the pensions of Colonial Governors, as regulated by the Pensions&quot; (Governors of Dominions, &amp;c.) Acts, 1911 and 1929.Present Position.2. The system upon which pensions are granted from.the Exchequer in respect of service as a Colonial Governor was laid down by Act of Parliament in 1911. The working of the system was reviewed by a Committee which sat during 1927 under the Chairmanship of the Earl Buxton, and on the recommenda-tion of that Committee an amending Act was passed in 1929 by which the essential features of the system were maintained, but certain improvements were effected in the rates of pension and in other directions. (See Cabinet Paper 13 of 1928.)  The system as now in force may be briefly summarised as follows : On retirement at the age of 60 (or in certain special circumstances at an earlier age) a Governor who has served as such for ten years or more is eligible for a pension calculated according to his length of service in the various classes of Governorship. There are four classes, and the respective pension rates are : Class I :  6 for every month of service. Class II :  5 for every month of service. Class III :  4 for every month of service. Class IV :  3 for every month of service.3. A Governor who has served as such for less than ten years receives no pension, unless he has also served in the Home or Colonial Civil Service; in which event, on his retirement in pensionable circumstances (i.e., on account of age, ill-health, abolition of office or the inability of the Secretary of State to find him further appropriate employment), he is granted in respect of his service as Governor a pension calculated in accordance with the Superannuation Acts and based upon the pensionable emoluments last drawn by him in a civil service post.4. The Acts contain numerous supplementary provisions with which I need not trouble my colleagues in the present connection. The two points to which I invite attention are : First, that a Governor who has held no civil service appointment receivesno pension or gratuity unless he completes ten years&apos; service as Governor;but that on the completion of ten years&apos; service he becomes eligible for apension which may be as much as  720 a year.Secondly, that a Governor who has been promoted to his Governorshipfrom a civil service appointment receives broadly speaking no pensionarybenefit (except as regards the added years) from his promotion unless heserves for at least ten years as a Governor.-    [9403]
The &apos;&apos; Civil Service &apos;.&apos; Governor,5. I will deal with the latter point first, since the normal method of filling Governorships is necessarily and properly by the appointment of officers who, in the course of a successful career in the Colonial Service, have proved their capacity for administration. Whatever reasons there may be for maintaining a ten years&apos; qualifying period in the case of the &apos;&apos; ad hoc&quot; Governor I shall discuss these later I do not know of any sound reason for maintaining it in the case of the promoted civil servant, and I may observe that the Buxton Committee, while recording the view that they did not consider that the ten years&apos; qualifying period should be abrogated, adduced no arguments in support of this view, so far as concerns the class of Governor with which I am now dealing. It is the general rule in the public service that promotion to higher office is accompanied by an increase iii prospective pension, and I fail to see why this process should stop short on an officer&apos;s appointment to a Governorship. The fact that it does so stop is not only inequitable; it is disadvantageous to the public interest, in that it restricts the freedom of the Secretary of State in selecting the best available officers for Governorships.6. Since a Governorship is the culmination of a career in the Colonial Service, it is clear that the officers selected who must be men of ripe experience  cannot always or even generally have ten years of active service before them at the time of their promotion. Further, in view of the diversity of salaries and conditions prevailing in the different Colonies, it is by no means inevitable that an officer selected for a Governorship should have previously attained to one of the most lucrative posts in the Colonial Service. We therefore have the anomalous situation that while such an officer might ex hypothesi look forward to promotion in the Colonial Service which would improve his pensionary position, he may well derive no such improvement from his selection for the highest promotion of allr and will therefore be worse off on retirement than he would have been if he had declined the Governorship, and in due course received promotion to a less exalted post. In existing circumstances this consideration is bound to be present to the mind of the Secretary of State when he is filling a vacant Governorship, and there can be no doubt that it has on occasion influenced officers to decline the offer of a Governorship, and has resulted in a justifiable feeling of grievance on the part of many who from a sense of public duty have accepted such an offer.7. The principle of assessing Governors&apos; pensions according to a fixed scale, irrespective of the salary drawn, is sound, and I do not propose any departure from it in the direction of computing the pension of a &quot;civil service&quot; Governor according to his emoluments as a Governor. What I propose is that the Acts should be amended so as to reduce from ten to five years the qualifying period of service as a Governor which admits of pension being awarded according to the fixed scale on the retirement of a &quot;civil service&quot; Governor. I suggest a qualifying period of five years, because it is a general rule in the public service to require a substantial period of service in a new office before promotion is fully reflected in pension. A Governor is normally appointed for a maximum term of six years, and I do not think that it is necessary to provide for the concession to apply unless he completes a substantial portion of that term.The &apos;&apos; ad hoc &apos;&apos; Governor.-8; I now turn to the case of the Governor appointed from outside the civil service. Such appointments are and should be rare, but it is undoubtedly in the interest of the State that the selection for these important offices should be made from the widest possible field, and there have been many notable examples of the benefits accruing to the public service from the occasional introduction of new blood in the person of a Governor selected by reason of his having displayed in other spheres of life those qualities which mark the successful Colonial administrator.9, f The conclusion of the Buxton Committee with regard to this, class of Governor was as follows ;:  ,. &quot;We have also carefully considered, the eases of Governors who prior to their appointment have not been employed in the permanent civil service
of the. State and by reason of their not having completed ten years&apos; service as Governor cannot qualify for the award of a pension. , : ;;   We have come to the conclusion that any alteration in the pension Law which would entitle such persons to receive a pension at the end of their;: service would be open to grave objection.    It involves an entirely new./ departure in pension practice, and would open the door to claims on the part of other persons holding salaried offices under the Crown which do not qualify for pension from public funds.   It must be remembered that in such, cases the Governor is aware of the position as regards salary and pension when he accepts office.  In these circumstances, the majority of the Committee consider that a provision of this kind would not be suitable.   One member of the Committee, however, wished to record his dissent from this view, and his opinion that the present system involves in practice the restriction of such Governorships to men with private resources, whereas such offices should be equally open to all subjects of the Crown.&quot;10. I do not deny that there is some force in the arguments of the majority . of the Committee, but I think the disadvantages outweigh these arguments. I have already referred, in the case of the &apos;&apos; civil service &apos;&apos; Governor, to the undesirability of the Secretary of State&apos;s selection of the most suitable candidates being hampered by the necessity to consider whether the person whom it is desired to select can be expected to serve for ten years after appointment. In the case of Governors appointed from outside the civil service, the present system restricts the field of selection to persons to whom the question of pension is immaterial or those who are of such an age that they can reasonably look forward to ten years&apos; service. So far as the former group is concerned, it may be pointed out that it is unusual and undesirable in the public service to allow the selection of persons for appointment to be governed not solely by merit and suitability, but by considerations relating to the private circumstances of individuals. As regards the second category it will be observed that no provision exists for cases in which. retirement is necessitated by ill-health, abolition of office or the impracticability of finding appropriate employment for the officer concerned: More than one case has been brought to my notice in which a Governor has been obliged by sickness to relinquish his appointment owing to circumstances quite beyond his control before completing the statutory period of ten years; and in one instance the development of a situation discreditable to the State which employed him was only averted by the untimely death of the distinguished officer in question.11. I recognise that any waiving of the statutory requirements in regard to the ten years&apos; qualifying period must be accompanied by adequate safeguards. : I think, however, that the majority of the Buxton Committee exaggerated the danger of any concession to Governors, who are sui generis, being used to support claims in respect of other servants of the Crown. I am told that the Buxton Committee had in mind particularly Ministers of the Crown. But I do not myself believe that a reform in the law relating to Governors&apos; Pensions Would or could be made a ground for claiming that the position with regard to Ministers&apos; pensions should be reopened.12. In the civil service an officer retired on medical grounds or owing to the exigencies of the service before completing ten years would be awarded a gratuity. All that I ask is that the same principle of compensation for premature loss of employment should be recognised in the case of a Governor. I think that a pension is more suitable than a gratuity in this case; and what I. would propose is that the Acts should be amended so as to allow discretion in special cases to the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to grant a proportionate pension to a Governor who is called upon to retire before completing ten years for reasons of health, abolition of office or on account of the inability of the Secretary of State to provide him&quot; with further. suitable employ-ment. . The concession should not apply to a Governor who resigns, his office:.or who after completing a term of office does not wish to be considered for further.; employment. It should be provided that every Minute of the Treasury granting a pension under this arrangement shall set forth the amount granted and the reasons for the grant, and shall be laid before Parliament.13. My recommendations are primarily made with reference to(Colonial Governors, but the Governors&apos; Pensions Acts cover both Colonial and Dominion
Governors; and cases occur in which an officer proceeds from a Governorship under the Colonial Office to one under the Dominions Office, and vice versa. I think, therefore, that the changes which I propose should apply to Governorships within the scope of the Acts, and I hope that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs will concur in this view.14. If the Cabinet accept my proposals, I shall be glad if they will authorise the preparation of draft legislation to give effect to them; and I hope that facilities for the passage of the Bill may be afforded at an early date. I do not believe such legislation would be contentious.(Initialled) P. C.-L.Downing Street, December 13, 1933.
