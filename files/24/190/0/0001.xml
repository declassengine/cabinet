On the 15th April, 1926, the Cabinet decided not toimpose a tax on imported malting barley (Cab.16 (26) Conclusion 2).In view, however, of the continued agitation amongst a section of farmers on this subject the Agricultural Policy Sub-Committee haverecently re-examined the proposal.asked that their  ^recommondation should be reported to the cabinet with a suggestion that if the Cabinet concurred in the recommendationa White Paper should be issued setting out the objections to theproposed duty.   I recommend to my colleagues that this cou.rse shouldbe adopted.   Several Members of Parliament have sviggested to me thatif the Government cannot accept the proposal for a malting barleytax we should make a statement at an early date giving the reasonsfor our decision.   The subject is too intricate to be dealt within reply to a Parliamentary Question, and a Uhite Paper seems tobe the best method of setting out the objections to the duty.        I attach a draft of a &quot;white Paper which I sviggestwe should present to Parliament forthwith.The  ub-Committee have decided against a tax and they havenistry of f-griCulture and Fisheries.2nd December, 1927.
                     iCilgniO 3ARL-Y TAX.     1.   His Jlajesty&apos;s  Government have  given very careful consideration to the proposal  that a tax  should  be  imposed on imported malting barley.     2.   The Agricultural  Tribunal of Investigation,  in their First  Interim Report,  published  on the 29th Llarch,  1923 (Cmd.1842). recommended that a  duty of  10/&apos;-  a quarter shotild be  imposed on imported malting barley,  to be collected  at the  brewery distillery or  malthouse,  with  a preference  of one-third on  barley imported from the Dominions.  The  duty  suggested by the Tribunal uas therefore an rJxcise duty  and not  a -Customs  duty.     3.   Agriculturists would object to a duty on all imported barley as they desire  cheap  foreign barley for feeding livestock. It  is, however,  impossible  for the Government to impose an Excise duty on  imported malting barley,  leaving  home-grown malting barley duty free,  without modification of the provisions of certain Commercial  Treaties.   Under  these Commercial Treaties which have been made with a number of foreign Governments, the British Government  are precluded  in  terms from imposing  an internal duty, that is,  an Ixcise duty,  on  any commodity imported from those countries which  is not equally applied to the same commodity grown or manufactured in  this country.   The provisions apply to a number of other countries by virtue of the Host favoured I-ation Clause in their Treaties.   If, therefore,  an Excise duty on malting barley were imposed,  the duty would have to apply to home-gro^n as well as imported; otherwise there would be a violation of the Treaties. This provision was inserted in the Commercial Treaties In the interests of our traders to prevent discriminating internal taxes on British goods in foreign countries.    It is obvious that the value of provisions in Commercial Treaties relating to  Customs duties wouldbe greatly diminished if the Governments with which the treaties weremade were free to Impose discriminating Jiccise duties on imported goods^
                                                    2.     4,   The proposals  that have been  made to the Government that a rebate  on beer  duty should be  granted in the case  of beer brewed  from home-grown barley would also be contrary to the Commercial Treaties  as they involve an  Excise diity which discriminates  against  imported barley.      5.   If the  tax  is to  be imposed, therefore, the duty will have to be a Customs  duty,  that is, it will  have to be imposed at the port and at the  time of importation.    A Customs duty, however, presents considerable  administrative  difficulties.      6,   These difficulties  arise from  the fact that the duty has  to  apply to  an article which cannot be distinguished on entry, but  has  to be taxed by reference to its subsequent use for only one  out  of several different uses to  which it may be put.   Imported barley may be used for feeding or grinding or for making malt, and  that malt may be used  either for brewing or distilling or for malt extracts, malted  foods  or for the  manufactv.re of vinegar. It is only in respect  of the barley malted for use in breweries and  distilleries that  the  duty is to be charged.  In order to secure his  it is necessary  to take precautions to secure  that all malt used by brewers or distillers has been made either from British barley or from imported barley upon wkich duty has been paid.  This  involves a requirement that imported barley intended for malting  and having paid duty at the port should be accompanied by certificates at  every  stage of its progress from the  port  to the malthouse, brewery or distillery.   As each consignment was split up into  separate parcels a fresh &quot;certificate would have to be made out for  each parcel:  a certificate would have to accompany each parcel as  it passed through the hands  of successive purchasers.Records,  open to revenue inspection, would have to be  kept by importers,  corn merchants,  maltsters,  brewers and distillers.All receipts and sales of parcels of imported duty-paid barleywould have to be shorn, and on every transaction in
which Imported du-sy-paid barley onunged hands a fresh official  formwould have to be filled In and signed.   RecordB would have to  be  keptand certificates would have to be provided by every person handlingBritish barley, except th6 original grower, in order to prevent themalting of foreign barley which had been imported duty free ostensiblyfor feeding to livestock and to prove to the revenue authorities thatbarley reaching the maltster, brewer or distiller had in fact beengrown in this country, and was not therefore liable to duty.   A stackof barley after leaving the farmer may be split up and pass throughmany hands before it reaches its ultimate destination.   Each part ofthe stack when sold to a nev/ purchaser would have to be accompanied bya certificate showing that It had been grown in this country, lest itmight ultimately be sold to brewers or distillers who would have toproduce evidence to show that it was home-grown barley.     7.   Arrangements would have to be made to pay back the duty  on imported duty-paid barley which was subsequently used for malt  extracts,vinegar, or for feeding purposes.     3.   The scheme would therefore impose burdensome restrictions and increased expense on a wide range of trades, none of which would obtainany benefit from the duty.   It would arouse the active opposition ofall the interests affected, and the Customs and Excise Department  wouldhave to administer a highly complex and i&amp;ritating scheme of control,containing considerable opportunities of evasion, without the willingco-operation of the trades concerned, and for a revenue return  whichcould be negligible compared to the trouble and expense invol-ved to allconcerned.     9.   Moreover a duty on imported malting barley would have to be accompanied by duties on foreign malt ana malt extract, by an increasein the Customs duties on Imported beer and spirits, and by an increasein the drawbacks on beer and spirits exported.   It would also  probablyproduce a demand that corresponding duties should be Imposed on maltsubstitutes, which would Involve an additional duty on sugar, and  new  .duties on maize and rioe. if used in the process of brewing or distillin
     10.  Yet It ia very doubtful whether even this elaboratescheme would be of much assistance to barley growers *    Brewersin purchasing malt are guided more by considerations of quality  than of price.   They must have malt of certain quality for their beers,and this necessitates the use of a, proportion of malt made fromimported barley whatever may be the price.   This proportion of imported barley has to be increased after a bad barley season inthis country so as to correct the deficiencies In the 3ritish barley.A Customs duty would not therefore result in any marked Increase inthe demand for British malting barley, though there might be someIncreased demand from distilleries.   On the other hand there is great danger that the Imposition of the duty would be followed byan actual fall in British barley prices if the duty stimulated home production and there was little increased demand from brewers.     11.  The annexed statement giving the home production and imports of barley, the number of barrels of beer brewed and theamount of spirit., distilled, shows that the decline in demand forBritish malting barley is due not to foreign competition but to  adecline in the production of beer and spirits.     12.  A Customs duty on imported malting barley, therefore,would be difficult to administer, would be open to the possibilityof evasion, would impose irritating restrictions on all traders  inbarley and malt, and would be of doubtful advantage to the farmer.For these reasons the Government cannot see their way to accept  theproper al.
