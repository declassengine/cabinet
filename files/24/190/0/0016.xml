I CIRCULATE to my colleagues the attached Second Report of theBeam Wireless Committee, containing inter alia the Conclusions reached bythe Committee on the question of Policy.    I am desired by the Committee to request the Cabinet to determine thequestion  of the  representation of His  Majesty&apos;s Government in GreatBritain at  the  forthcoming  Conference  with  representatives  of theDominion and Indian Governments.   A suggestion has been made that HisMajesty&apos;s Government  in Great Britain should have two representatives,one of whom (a Cabinet Minister) should be Chairman of the Conference.If the Cabinet approve  this suggestion, it might be advisable to invite  thoseDominion Governments which have indicated their intention of appointingtwo representatives to  reconsider  the matter  and to nominate a singlerepresentative, who could  be assisted at the Meetings of the conference by one or more expert advisers as may be thought necessary.    The Committee also desire to draw the attention of the Cabinet to thedesirability  of arrangements being made with a view to  the proposed conference  being held as early as possible in January next.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government. ]Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1927.SECRET.Copy  No.  80CP. 316 (27).CABINET.BEAM  WIRELESS  COMMITTEE.SECOND REPORT.    1.   AT their meeting on the 7th December, 1927 (Cabinet 60 (27), Conclusion 2),the Cabinet approved the proposal in our Interim Report  that a  Conference ofrepresentatives of the Empire Governments concerned should be summoned forthwith to enquire into the question of the competition of Beam and Cable services.  We now submit the results of our examination of the situation which has arisen in consequenceof this competition, and our suggestions as to the policy to be adopted by the BritishGovernment in regard to  the matter.The Effect of the Competition on the Cable Companies.    2.   The  phenomenal success of the  four Beam wireless services  between theUnited Kingdom and Australia,  Canada,  India  and  South Africa  is  rapidlyproducing a crisis in the affairs of the Eastern Telegraph Company, and of some ofits associated companies,  and of the Pacific Cable Board.  Before the advent of theBeam,  the Eastern  Company had a monopoly  of the telegraph traffic with SouthAfrica;  it shared the Indian traffic  with the Indo-European Company, and theAustralian with the Pacific Cable.  On the Canadian service the Beam competes withthe American companies  (Western Union and Commercial) and with the ImperialCables. The Canadian rates are at present the same by cable and by wireless, and onthis route no critical position arises at the moment.    3.   Before the opening of the wireless services, the charge for a full ratetelegram to Australia, which had been 2s. Qd. a word prior to the 1st February, 1927,was reduced to 2s. by cable.  The South African rate was 2A., which has come downto Is. 8d.  The opening rate of the Beam Service later in the year was Is. Sd. bycable and Is. 4:d. by the Beam.   The rate to India was Is. 8d., and it is now Is. 5d.by cable and Is. Id. by the Beam.  The Beam full rate is, therefore, cheaper than theold rate by 7d. to 10c?. a word, and it has already brought the cable rates down by Zd.to 4ti. a word. There is a uniform difference oi &amp;d. on each route between the cable and wireless charge for full rate traffic, and a proportionate difference on the cheapertraffic.The Position of the Eastern and Eastern Extension Companies.    4.   We attach (Appendix 1) a statement prepared by the  General Post  office with the assistance of information supplied confidentially by the Eastern Company,showing the present distribution of traffic, expressed in terms of revenue, between the cables and wireless  services and the distribution before the Beam services  opened,together  with an estimate of  the  current  annual losses incurred by the  cable companies.  As the Beam services become better known and more efficient, furtherdiversion of traffic may follow, and the cable losses may be proportionately increased.On the figures it will be seen that the total losses of the cable systems due to diversion to the  wireless services are  estimated to come to   761,000 per annum, of which 605,000.f alls upon the Eastern group.  The Eastern Companies&apos; gross losses are, in[16947]B
fact, reduced by about  150,000 through the operation of joint purse arrangements,J)rincipally with the Indo-European Company.  In addition, the Eastern group have ost a sum of  235,000 by reduction of rates.    5.  We have  been  supplied  confidentially by  the  Chairman of  the  EasternCompany with estimates of loss of revenue of  the Eastern and  Eastern ExtensionCompanies, which  do not materially differ from the Post Office estimates. The total net revenue of the two Companies in the.year prior to the advent of the Beam was 1,800,000, of which it is calculated that they are:likely- to.loss,about  700,000 owingto diversion of  traffic and reauction of rates.  This loss is equivalent to nearly40 per cent, of the Companies&apos; net revenue.  The percentage would be much higher ifthe figure was taken on  traffic revenue alone   The companies have  large investedreserves from which a very substantial income is derived.    6.  The financial position of the Eastern and Eastern Extension Companies maybe summarised as follows : -	Eastern.	Hasten) Extension.Capital  Ordinary stock 3  per cent, preference stock 4 per cent, debenture stock Dividend Investment in respect of reserves .. Cash and liquid asseta Investment fluctuation Total disclosed reserves	  5,000,000 2,000.000 2,000,000 10 per cent, free of income tax (for last 8 years)   2,370,000 500,000 840,000	  4,000.000 Nil 752,400 10 per cent, free of income tax (for last 8 years).   4,000,000 50,000 450,000	3,710,000	4,500,000In addition there are known to be hidden reserves of substantial amount.     7.  Wre are informed that up to the present  the Eastern group of companies have not been able to effect any operating economies,  and that, accordingly, theirgross loss of revenue represents also their net loss.  It seems improbable  also thatany operating economies which the companies might be able  to make would have a decisive effect on the general position.  Sir J. Pender has stated  tEat the presentreceipts of the Eastern Company would not cover working expenses without somedepletion of reserves, and that he would like to reduce the cable rates to  the same level as the Beam on the competitive routes.  He has also said  that if it is decided to embark upon acute competition by a rate-cutting war, the cable companies  will haveno alternative but liquidation.  For the moment Sir J. Pender has agreed to deferany reduction of rate until the 1st January, 1928.The Position of the Pacific Cable Board and of Imperial Cables.     8.  The Pacific Cable Board expect to get through the present year without a deficit, owing to drastic economies and the fact  that  they  budgetted, for thefinancial year 1927-28, for a  surplus  of   100,000 the realised surplus  of thepreceding&apos;year.  In spite of all practicable economies the Pacific Cable will probablyshow a deficit next year unless the loss of traffic remains stationary at almost itspresent figure.  This deficit, after the Reserve Fund is exhausted; will be a liabilityon  the participating Governments (Great  Britain, Canada, Australia  and NewZealand), and may induce the Canadian Government, which has less  interest in the cable than the other Partners, to sever partnership.  Five-eighteenths of any deficitwill fall upon  the British Exchequer.     The Imperial Cables, which carry the bulk of the Pacific Cable  traffic betweenGreat  Britain and  Canada, for which the Imperial  Government   is  financiallyresponsible, also lost a considerable part of their revenue.     9.  After making every allowance, it  appears to us that the  facts set out inthe  preceding paragraphs  show that in a comparatively brief  space of  time the
competition of the Beam has affected the cables to such an extent that unless thepresent position is substantially modified, they cannot continue to operate on anecouomic basis.  We are  assured that  the  present Beam  rates yield a very highprofit,  and that those rates could be very  substantiallv reduced  and  still give ahandsome return on the capital invested in the Beam undertakings.   It  follows thatthe Beam companies could always afford to undercut the cable rates, and it seems clear that in a rate war the cables could not hope to recover  their lost traffic, andwould ultimately be involved in financial losses of an even greater magnitude than are at present being incurred.   Having regard to considerations of this kind1, those responsible for the cable companies may well be driven to the conclusion that it wouldbe preferable to liquidate the undertakings and distribute the reserves among the shareholders, rather  than expend those reserves in a rate war in  which they can have very slender hopes of a successful issue.The necessity for the Retention  of the Cable System.    10.  We agree with the view of the Postmaster-General  that  the  cables, or agreat majority of them, will have to be maintained.  Our reasons for this conclusionare briefly summarised in the following paragraphs.    11.  The Reports of Sir  S. Wilson&apos;s Committee,  which  are included  in theAppendix,  show that a considerable  number of the important  trunk cables must beretained as a bare minimum for the maintenance of vital  communications in timeof war, and this minimum would have to be  increased if  provision  is to be made against interruptions and for carrying commercial traffic with reasonable expedition.    12.  Apart from the main routes, there are many parts of the Empire (besidesforeign countries served by the Eastern system) which are  not at present, and maynot for some time to come, be accessible by wireless.   The Beam services are subjectto daily periods of fading of greater or less duration and  they occasionally experiencemore prolonged interruptions,  which would be a serious embarrassment to urgentcommercial telegrams if the cables  were not  available.   It  might be possible to dispense with some of the cables which have been duplicated to  carry growing traffic,a large portion of which is now  carried by the Beam, or to provide alternative routes,but with these exceptions it seems essential to  preserve the  cable system as a whole,even at the cost of public funds if there is no other alternative.  If the cables areto be continued as a commercial undertaking, it  may for  some years  be  foundexpedient to  maintain a margin in  case of interruption or emergency beyond the bare minimum required in time  of war.  There is the further question whether, with due regard to the interests of British trade, the Government should acquiesce in theBritish cables in foreign territories, such as South America and the Ear East, being sold to American or other foreign control.    13.  After careful consideration, it appears to us that there are four possible alternative courses of action open to the Government.                  Alternative  Courses open to the Government.I. Non-intervention.    14.  The first of  these alternatives would be  a policy  of non-intervention.Matters might be allowed to develop without any interference on  the  part  of theGovernment until the cable  companies were either  (a)  driven out  of business, the cables being abandoned, or (b)  forced to dispose of their systems at a knock-downprice to the Marconi  Company or to other, and possibly foreign, purchasers.  in either,  event  the. Governments  concerned would  have  to  meet recurring  deficitson the Pacific Cables or sell them at a heavy loss.  We doubt if public opinion wouldtolerate  a  situation  under which the  Marconi interests  would secure a  virtualmonopoly of both cable and wireless  services, and there would, in any event, be nosecurity  that  existing communications  with the less  important places would bemaintained or would remain under British control.II. Purchase and Operation of Cables.    15.  The second alternative would be that the Government should purchase and operate the cables.  No doubt under the stress of wireless  competition ;the Eastern       [16947]                                                        B 2
 Company could be driven to sell their system much be. /w its book value, but the capital required would,  in  any event, be  considerable, and the enterprise would probably be unremunerative unless the Governments concerned  obtained effective control over the wireless  rates.   The Governments of the Empire would-, in fact, be purchasing the more, obsolete and less remunerative system  while leaving the modern and cheaper means of communication as a formidable competitor under independent control.  The Government would, in fact, be driven to purchase not only the whole of the cable undertakings, but also the wireless interests.  In this connection regard should be had to the  following considerations :-      16.   The landing licence granted to the Eastern group provides that the Govern- ment may purchase, upon such terms as may be agreed, the. whole of the Companies&apos; undertaking &quot;or such portions  thereof as may leave the  Companies in possession of an efTicienCself-contained system, capable of being worked remuneratively,&quot; and the Companies bind themselves not  to oppose a Bill promoted  for compulsory purchase except in so far as may be necessary to secure the. insertion  of provisions affording fair protection.  If the trunk cables, which  are the principal sufferers from wireless competition, were purchased, it would probably be. necessary to take over the greater part of the Companies&apos; system.   They would not. and could hardly be expected to, maintain and work a number of isolated and subsidiarv cables if they&apos;ceased to control the main  routes, which yield the  great bulk of the traffic.  The difficulties of working the Eastern system with  its world-wide ramifications and terminals situated in the Dominions, Colonies and foreign  countries, either through a  Government Department or through an organisation constituted on the  lines of the Pacific Cable Board, need not be emphasised.  These difficulties would  be still greater  if the Dominions claimed to operate the terminals in their own territory, and an Imperial Cable. Board would be in a much less favourable position than a  private company as a concessionaire from foreign Governments. III. Subsidy.     17.   The third alternative would seem to  be a direct subsidy to keep the cables alive.  Even if the wireless competition had reached its maximum intensity, a subsidy, payable in part at any rate out of the profits  of  the Beam, would be open to objection, but would mean a limited and possibly diminishing liability.  But the possibility must be faced that new Beam services will be opened which will further impinge, on cable traffic and.jeopardise the maintenance of the cable system in  regions where, the existing Beam services do  not yet penetrate.  For example, the question of preserving the Eastern Companies&apos; system  in  South  America or  in the Far  East might soon arise.  And if the Government at any time, were forced to  acquiesce in demands by the wireless companies for further rate reduction, an increase in the subsidy would have to follow.   A subsidy ought strictly to be apportioned between the Imperial Exchequer, India and the Dominions, but it may be doubted whether any substantial contribution  would be forthcoming from  India and South Africa.  The Imperial Exchequer and the Australian Government benefit financially from the Beam services, but the Indian and South  African Governments do not. The Beam services have not been sufficiently long in operation to afford a reliable index of the. permanent diversion from the cables, or of the  increase in the volume of traffic due to reduced tariffs.  It is impossible, therefore, to give any reliable estimate of what a subsidy might cost, but if the cable losses  due  to diversion, as distinct from reduction of rates, are of the order of  600,000 or  more, it seems not unlikely that a subsidy of some  250,000 a year or more might be required.  We feel that the Cabinet  will share our view that a  policy of subsidy would  be a very dangerous, expensive and objectionable solution. IV. A Working Arrangement between the Interests concerned. .     18.   The fourth  alternative would be that some working arrangement of the nature of a tariff agreement or  a traffic pool or common  purse should be reached between the cable companies, the wireless companies and the Pacific Cable Board. If the wireless services, both in the United Kingdom and in the Dominions and India, were under the unfettered control of the Government, there would probably be no serious difficulty in coming to a traffic arrangement with the cables.     19.   But in India and the  Dominions concerned, i.e., South Africa and Aus-tralia,  the services are in  the hands of wireless companies operating under licencesgranted by the respective Governments and embodied in formal agreements.    In
India and South Africa the Governments have no financial holding in the Companies.The Australian Government holds 500,001 out of a million shares, and it is under-stood that steps are being  taken to strengthen the  Governments control over theCompany&apos;s policy.   In all three cases the existing agreements require the Govern-ments to place no obstacle in the way of the development of  the wireless services.It is understood that the Marconi Company has large holdings in all three companies and probably a controlling voice in the policy of two of them (India and  SouthAfrica).  The Indian contract is determinable at the option of the Government ofIndia in the  year 1937.  The South African contract is determinable at the option of the South African Government also in 1937.    20.  In Great Britain the Beam stations are owned and operated by the Govern-ment through the Post Office. But when the negotiations with the Marconi Companytook place in  1924, Ministers gave specific undertakings to the Company to develop the wireless services to their maximum without regard &quot;to cable interests, and the sub-stance of those undertakings has been embodied  in a clause in the contract signed on2Sth July,  1924, between the Postmaster-General and the Company, which &quot;runs asfollows:         &quot;  The Postmaster-General shall, after consultation with the Company,  fix    such rates of charge to the public for the sending and  receiving of telegrams by    means of the Beam Station as shall, in his opinion, be calculated to attract the    largest possible volume of traffic with due regard  to economic considerations.&quot;    21.  It seems impossible in the face of these agreements to establish any trafficpool with the object of securing to the cables traffic and revenue which would  other-wise be diverted to the Beam, except with the assent of the Marconi Company and the subsidiary  companies operating in the Dominions, and it is difficult to see how the wireless interests could be induced to acquiesce.   The capital cost of a pair of Beamstations is only a fraction of the cost of a  long-distance  cable,  and the  wireless services could make handsome profits out of a tariff which would not keep the  cablesin existence.  The most that could be urged would be that it might pay the wirelesscompanies better to come to some arrangement  with the cables  in preference  toembarking  on a rate war  which would leave them with a larger traffic but with a smaller revenue. But there are a number of possible bases upon which some arrange-ment  might be reached and which might be  explored  in   discussion with  theCompanies.    22.  Whatever be the  ultimate solution, it is important that the cable rates should not be reduced pending a decision.  If the cable and  wireless rates areequalised,  the Eastern Company anticipate, probably with good  reason, that theywould recover the bulk  of the lost traffic.   In that event, the Dominion and IndianBeam Companies would certainly  retaliate with a  proposal  for  a corresponding reduction in the wireless rates, which they could well  afford and the British Govern-ment could  hardly refuse.  It would be extremely difficult to restore the rates whichthe influence of competition  had reduced, and the result would be that the ultimatecost of any pooling arrangement or subsidy would be pro tanto higher.  Sir JohnPender has said that the Eastern Companies cannot be expected to consent to work ata loss indefinitely.  As instructed by the Cabinet, he has been informed of the pro-posal to summon an Imperial Conference, but he, nevertheless,  desires to reserve hisfreedom of action after the 1st January, 1928.  It is therefore important that definite conclusions should be reached as soon as possible.    23.  We  agree  with the  Postmaster-General  in  the  view that, unless  theprogress of wireless eventually renders the cables superfluous,  the only satisfactorypermanent solution  may be for the  Governments  of the  Dominions  and  Indiato  regain  possession  of  the  wireless services, or  at  any  rate,  such measureof  control  as  will enable  them to  be worked in  co-operation  with  the cables.The establishment  of  a unified system is at  present out of  the  question, andsome interim  measure is inevitable.   On the whole, we think that, notwithstanding the difficulties  involved, it  would  be  wise to base the Governments  policy uponthe fourth alternative and to strive  for some working agreement between thevarious interests.  If the Cabinet adopt this suggestion, and if it is also acceptedby the forthcoming Imperial Wireless Conference, perhaps the most hopeful coursewould be for the interested Governments to agree to appoint some impartial Chairman
to confer with the. three interests and to endeavour to find a basis of agreement.  Wewarn the Cabinet, however, that it may be difficult to persuade the different Govern-ments, whose interests are to some extent in conflict, to entrust such powers to any individual, even if he is not invested with the powers of an arbitrator.     24.  We are of opinion that the  Imperial Wireless Conference should not beallowed itself to negotiate with the cable and wireless interests, but should endeavourto frame an agreed policy upon which  such  negotiations should proceed.Appointment of Departmental Committee.     25.  In  view of the highly important and technical considerations involved, wesuggest that an  Inter-departmental Committee should be appointed  forthwith toprepare documents for the. use of the Imperial Wireless Conference and briefs for theuse of the Representatives of the British Government at that Conference, but not tonegotiate in any way with the cable and wireless interests.                                CONCLUSIONS.    26.  We submit the following conclusions to the Cabinet:      (1.) That the Representatives of  His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain          should be informed that,  of  all the  alternative  proposals which  His          Majesty&apos;s Government have so far considered in regard to the competi-          tion between the cable and wireless services, the one which they would          prefer is  the proposal for securing a working agreement, between the          cable  and wireless interests,  on the  general  lines indicated in  para-          graphs 18-21 of this report.     (2.) That it would not seem desirable  that the Conference itself  should enter          into any negotiations with the cable and wireless interests, and the terms          of reference did not  contemplate  this; at the same  time, it should be          explained to the Representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great          Britain and to any Dominion Government  or the Government of  India          which may enquire that the. terms of reference do not preclude the hearing          of evidence or the reception of suggestions  from any cable and wireless          bodies concerned.     (3.) That if, during the course of  the work of the Conference, it should appear          possible that a settlement on the lines  of a working agreement might be          reached,  the Representatives  of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in Great          Britain should be authorised, provided the  Representatives of the other          Governments concur and  are similarly authorised, to  agree, to negotia-          tions with the commercial interests concerned with a  view to finding a          basis of agreement ad referendum to the Governments.  Such negotiations          might be  entrusted to a single independent person unconnected with  any          of the Governments.    (4.) That every effort should be made to  secure that there should be no reduction          of the existing cable rates pending some decision.    (5.) That it is very desirable that the Conference should meet as soon as possible          after the beginning of January  in view of the fact that certain of the          Representatives of the Dominions are already in this country and others          will arrive before the end of the year.               That, in the meantime, an Inter-departmental  Committee, composed          of representatives of                      The Treasury,                     The Post Office,                     The Dominions Office,                     The Colonial Office,                     TBe India Office,                     The War Office,                     The Admiralty,                     The Air Ministry,          should be appointed  to prepare  documents for the use of the Imperial          Wireless  Conference and briefs for the use of the Representatives of  His
       Majesty&quot;s Government in Great Britain at the Conference,  but  should       not, of course, negotiate in any way with the cable and wireless interests.       Such Inter-departmental Committee should continue in being during the       Conference and be available to prepare any further information required       by the Conference or the British Representatives.                              Signed on behalf of the Committee,                                           JOHN GILMOUR, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,     December 20, 1927.APPENDIX I.

Those figures relate only to terminal traffic between the United Kingdom anil the Dominions concerned;they do not include transit traffic to and from destinations beyond, which may have been diverted for part ofits route from the cables to the wireless  service.  An estimate of the transit traffic could  not be framedwithout a more elaborate analysis of  the Eastern Companies&apos; receipts.    For the purpose of estimating the loss to the cable system, the pre-Beam traffic has been valued at thecurrent cable rates, and the statement of losses does not therefore include tho  sacrifice of revenue resultingfrom the reduction of cable rates since last year.  The charges levied by the British Post Office at this end and the Postal Administrations in the Dominions for terminal services have been excluded throughout, andthe revenue represents the receipts by the  cable and wireless administrations in respect  of the cable orwireless transit only.

Interim Report. Introduction.     1.  Attention was  first drawn by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to the position which had arisen as a result of the successful working of the  &quot;Beam&apos;&quot; System of Wireless Communications and the  possible reactions on Imperial Communications from a defence point of view of the inevitable competition between wireless and cable services.     It was pointed out that more  than 50 per  cent, of the total traffic between Australia and Europe was now being carried by the &quot; Beam &quot; Wireless Service, and that there was  obviously a  tendency  to  render cable services  commercially unprofitable.     In these circumstances  the Australian Government asked that the matter should be immediately referred  to the  Committee of Imperial Defence for consideration and report in regard to the defence aspects of the problem. Terms of Reference.     2.  The question was considered by the Imperial Communications Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, who in turn proposed to set up a Sub-Committee to examine the strategical aspects of the problem with  the  following  terms of reference :         &quot; In view  of the  possibility of  cable working to Australia or elsewhere     becoming uneconomical as a result of wireless competition         (a.) To examine and report on the possibility of long or short wave services               becoming  partially or  wholly  useless  in time  of  war due to               &quot; jamming,&quot; intentional or otherwise.   Trials to be carried out if              necessary.        .(6.) To examine into the  possibility  of  interference with cables in time of              war.        (c.) To consider whether the retention of cables in time of war is an absolute              necessity for certain classes of Government messages on account of              alleged superior degree of secrecy over that  of wireless.&quot;     3.  The proposal to set up this Sub-Committee and its terms of reference were communicated to  the Governments of the Dominions with  an intimation that the co-operation of Dominion representatives on the Sub-Committee would be welcomed.    As a result, the terms of reference quoted above were approved and representa-tives were appointed, the Sub-Committee being finally composed as shown on page 2.    In nominating  a representative,  the Commonwealth Government stressed  the urgency of the question, and requested that the, Sub-Committee should be required to report before Christmas of  this year.   The Governments of  Canada  and New Zealand also emphasised through their representatives the need for an early report.      [16735]                                                      B 2
Scoj)e of Present Report.    4.  We therefore decided to confine our enquiries in the first instance to coin-munications between the. United Kingdom and Australia and New Zealand and tosubmit an interim report on this particular aspect of the problem before proceeding to an examination of our terms of reference as applied to Imperial Communicationsgenerally. &quot;Jamming &quot; of Long or Short Wave Wireless Services.     5.   The first point  referred to us for consideration is:          &quot; To examine and report on the possibility of long or short wave services     becoming  partially  or  wholly  useless in time of  war due  to  &apos; jamming,&apos;     intentional or otherwise.   Trials to be carried out if necessary.&quot;     (a.) Long\ Wave Services. We are of opinion that intentional &quot; jamming &quot; of long wave services is not likely to be attempted in war time.  We have been informed that during the late war proposals for &quot; jamming &quot; the enemy&apos;s long wave wireless services were fully examined,  but, as it was considered more&apos; profitable to  use our own stations for active communications  and to  allow  the enemy  to  continue signalling, were not put into  operation.   We understand that no new factor has arisen which would lead  to any modification of the decision which was then reached. On the  other hand, the existing long wave wireless stations cannot be regarded as a substitute, in point  of capacity,  for either short wave  wireless or cable  services, owing to the necessarily slower speed of working of the  former, for reception at great distances.     (b.) Short Wave Services. The &quot; jamming *&apos; of the existing &quot; Beam &quot; services as now arranged was considered to  be  so  easy that trials  were not regarded  as necessary.     Unintentional   interference  now  experienced  is  sufficient  to  show   that intentional &quot; jamming &quot;  is simple. Imjn-ovements  in the arrangements, only  to be arrived at by research, may reduce this trouble.     Assuming that  the &quot;Beam&quot; services, as such, can be &quot;jammed&quot; easily, the  short  wave  service would  have  to  resort   to all-round  working, which would  entail  a  great   drop  in  speed,  probably down  to  &quot;hand  speed.&quot;     In  order to ascertain the degree of &quot; jamming  &quot; which  could be effected with such all-round short  wave services, arrangements were made for trials to be carried out.  These consisted of communications between two Post Office stations (120 miles apart) at Burnham (Somersetshire) and Dollis Hill (London)  on wavelengths which (a) were unknown to  the &quot; jamming &quot; station, and (&amp;) were capable of alteration on a pre-arranged plan.  The &quot; jamming &quot; station  was H.M.S. &quot; Yarmouth,&quot; situated approximately 77 miles  from  Burnham and 75 miles from Dollis Hill. The  pre-arranged plan  for  altering  wavelengths  was, of  course,  unknown  to  H.M.S. &quot;Yarmouth.&quot;     The conclusions  drawn from these trials are :      (a.) Using open  aerial systems for both transmission and reception, it appears          feasible to &quot; jam &quot;  short wave reception  when the distance between the          &quot;jamming &quot; station and the receiving station is  suitable.     (&amp;.) If the transmitting station changes its wavelength and continues to send,          then  it is  possible  for the  &quot; jamming&quot; station, knowing the  note          characteristics and type of transmission  of the transmitting station, to          follow up the transmission and &quot;jam &quot;  it.  The  time  taken to do  this          depends upon             (i.)  The  intensity of signal strength of the transmitting station;           (ii.)  The degree of change of wavelength;          (iii.)  The  number of operators  available  for  interception  and their                  operating skill; and          (iv.)  Whether or no the type of- transmission  remains the same.   For                  example, a change  of language at the same time as a change of                  wavelength  and call sign would  render interception  much more                  difficult.
     (c.) An  improvement of the efficiency of the  &quot;jamming&quot; station  may be           obtained by adopting other means  of measuring the wavelength of the           transmitting station and passing it from the receiving to the transmitting           room of the &quot; jamming &quot; station.     (d.) To render &quot; jamming &quot; more difficult, research is required into methods of           improving  directional  reception  to cut down  to a  minimum reception           from the hack and sides of the receiving station.  Given a more perfect           reception, &quot; jamming &quot; would only  be practicable by a station placed in           line between the two communicating stations, in which case working the           other  way round the earth would be resorted to.  It is unlikely that a           possible enemy would  be  so placed geographically  as to  &quot;jam&quot;  both           routes.     (e.) &quot; Jamming &quot; in the past, and this is again brought out in these trials, has           rarely been  found to  be completely efficacious  where wave changing is           possible,  as  in &quot;all round &quot; short wave.   There are always gaps when           urgent messages can be got through. In effect, it is considered that at the present time  &quot;jamming&quot; an  &quot;all  round&quot; short-wave station is practicable up  to a certain point,  though some intermittent working will always be possible. Further research is required to improve directional reception so as to make &quot;jamming &quot; more difficult. Liability of Cables to interference.     6.  The second point referred to us is          &quot; To examine into the possibility of interference with cables in time of war.&quot; We have been informed that the cutting of cables, except in comparatively shallow water, is not an  easy operation unless a properly equipped cable ship is available and  can be assured of adequate protection over  the necessary period of  time.  It will be appreciated that, in these circumstances, it is difficult  to estimate  the extent to which any cable is liable to interference.  The answer must depend on  the nature of the war, the relative position of the belligerents, and the strategical situation.   As a generalisation, it may be accepted that the Power which has obtained the command of the sea will be able to  maintain its own cable communications and will be  in a position to interrupt those  of its enemies.  Beyond this, in the absence of precise hypotheses, it is not possible for us to express any definite  opinion. Secrecy of Communications.     7.  The third point which has been referred to us is         &quot; To consider whether the retention of cables in time of war is an absolute    necessity for  certain  classes of Government messages on  account of  alleged    superior degree of secrecy over that of wireless.&quot;    8. There is no doubt that cables are very valuable indeed in  war  if only fromthe point of view  of certainty in operation so long as they are not tampered  with.    9. From the point of view of secrecy, the outstanding  advantages of cablesover  W/T lies in  the fact that the cable system provides, from its very nature, amore private  channel of communication, and permits of definite protective measuresbeing adopted with a view to precluding unauthorised persons having  access to the messages at any period  of their journey.  W/T, on the other hand, offers no  suchpossibility, and messages once despatched by this means are liable to be read by anystation within range.  From past experience it is clear that no message transmitted by W/T in any form can be regarded as inviolate.   The &quot; Beam &quot; system is  only slightly less liable to interception in this  respect than ordinary  W/T.    10. Ample proof exists that a properly trained cryptographic bureau can  in course of time break down the security of practically any code or  cypher, providedsufficient data in the  form of messages are available  to work on.  The  crypto-grapher is entirely helpless in the absence of these data, whilst  the more there areavailable to him the greater and more rapid will be his production of  results.
u    11.  Whilst data are easily obtainable  in the case of messages transmitted byW/T (&apos;; Beam &quot;  or otherwise), it is not so readily obtainable when the messageis entrusted to the cables.  The required material can in this case only be secured bythe difficult (but it is understood not impossible) process of secretly  tapping the linewhere  it travels overland, or by the subornation of the personnel employed  by thecdble company. Both of these dangers can be guarded against to a large extent.    12.  W/T therefore  provides the cryptographer with an unlimited supply ofhis requirements at little or ho trouble to himself, whilst on the other hand the cablesafford him  nothing save at the expense of considerable trouble and risk of detection.Quite apart from the grave considerations of reliability, absence of interference by&quot;jamming,&quot; and  the desirability of maintaining an alternative route to obviatecongestion, &amp;c, the retention of the cable system will thus be seen to be a matter ofconsiderable strategic importance by reason of  the greater security  it affords to thecodes and cyphers employed.Minimum  of Requirements in Cables.    13.  Having regard to the above considerations,  we have applied ourselves, forthe purpose of this interim report, to an examination of the extent to which cableswould  be required for communication between  the United Kingdom and Australiaand New Zealand in the event of a war in the Far East; this includes communications with Singapore and/or the theatre of operations.    14.  We have been given to understand that a  rough estimate of the essentialminimum number of words per day which would need to be passed over the availablecables in both directions is                                            Beginning- of war.      Later.           For the Fighting Services    ...       21,000         110,000           For other Messages  ...      ...       75,000          30,000                       Total  ...       ...       96,000        140,000    15.  The  estimated capacity of one line of the Eastern Telegraph Company&apos;ssystem to the  Far East is 60,000 words per day.    The estimated capacity of the British Cable  System to the Westward  is:          Transatlantic (via  Azores)       ...       ...      45,000 words per day.         Transatlantic (direct)   ...       ...       ...       15,000    ,,      ,,         Transpacific (old Cable) ...       ...      ...       60,000         Transpacific (new Cable) ...       ...      ...      100,000    16.  In order therefore to meet war-time requirements the following cables are,in our opinion, the minimum provision which should be ensured :          East-about:  One  cable of the Eastern Telegraph            Company&apos;s  System   (via   Aden-Colombo-            Singapore and from  thence to  Port Darwin            and Hong Kong)         ...       ...       ... 60,000 words per day.         West-about: Both Imperial  Transatlantic  cabks [QQ Q00     d     d                     The  Isew Transpacific cable     ...)              r     -         The capacity of the West-about route is  limited  by the capacity of  the            two Imperial Atlantic cables.  The capacity of the New Pacific cable            is 100,000  words per day.  It is considered preferable to retain this one            rather than the old cable,  the surplus capacity  being used for traffic            between Canada and  Australia and New Zealand.    It is to be noted that provision on such a scale would fall short of the estimated requirements by 20,000 words per day, while no account has been taken of the UnitedKingdom traffic to and from Canada or India.  A duplicate line of cables would be most desirable especially on the Eastern route.Control of Wireless Services.    17.  If the above minimum provision should represent the only cable servicesavailable, the  balance of traffic would  have to be carried by means  of wireless.
 Moreover the two Imperial Cables are the only North Atlantic Cables under entirely British control.   This being the  case it becomes of the first  importance to ensure that all the wireless  communications  are under effective  British control.  We recommend that attention should be directed to this matter and, should there be any cases of doubt, that steps should be taken to secure adequate assurances on the point. Summary.     18.  We  summarise  our  conclusions  and  recommendations,  therefore,  as follows:      (1.) Intentional interference  with long-wave  wireless services is unlikely to be           resorted to in time of war but for technical reasons in respect of speed           of working long-wave wireless services  cannot entirely replace short-wave           wireless or cable services.     (2.) &quot;Jamming&quot; of the existing &quot;Beam&quot; stations  is practicable.   To make           &quot;jamming&quot; more difficult, further research, with a view to  improving           directional reception, is required.   A serious  effort to &quot;jam&quot;  would           probably result under present conditions in the &quot; Beam &quot; service having           to revert to all-round working at a much slower speed.     (3.) &quot;Jamming&quot; an  &quot;all-round&quot;  short-wave wireless station is  practicable           up to a point, though some intermittent working will always be possible.     (4.) The extent of interference with cables in  time of war will depend upon the           nature of the  war,  the relative ]X)sition of the  belligerents, and the           strategical situation.   The Power which has obtained  command of the           sea should be able to secure comparative immunity for its cable services.     (5.) Cable services have a marked superiority over  wireless services  in  respect           of secrecy.     (6.) For communications between the United Kingdom and Australia and New           Zealand and the theatre of operations, in the event of a war in the Far           East, the following minimum provision of cable services is essential:                East-about:  One cable of the Eastern Telegraph Company&apos;s System.               West-about: Both Transatlantic Cables.                            The New Transpacific Cable.               This provision will fall short of estimated requirements hy approxi-          mately 20,000 words per diem and makes no allowance for traffic to and           from Canada and India.     (7.) On the assumption that no other cable services were available the balance          of traffic would have to be carried  by  wireless.  It is, therefore, of the          first  importance  that  all  wireless  communications  should  be under          effective British control.Conclusion.     19.  Lastly, we wish to emphasise that, in our view, all forms of communica-tion cable  as well as  wireless will be required in war and  that the normaldevelopment of wireless communications should not be arrested in order to maintain essential cable services.     In  this  interim report we have confined our attention to communications with australia and New Zealand  only.  We  now  propose  to  address  ourselves to an examination  of our terms  of reference as applied to  Empire  Communicationsgenerally.

(C.I.D. Paper No. 836-B.)     THE COMMITTEE had under consideration  a  Note by the acting Chairmanof  the Imperial  Communications  Committee, covering&apos; an Interim  Report by aspecial Sub-Committee on  the  strategical aspects  of the competition which was developing between &quot;Beam&quot; wireless and cable services (OLD. Paper No. 836-B).     SIR SAMUEL WILSON expressed regret that the Report of his Sub-Committeehad only been circulated to the  Committee of Imperial Defence a few hours beforethe meeting.  The urgency in this connection was due to repeated representations bythe Prime Minister of Australia for an early report  on the subject.  The representa-tives of Canada and New Zealand on his Sub-Committee had also urged that thematter should be dealt with as  expeditiously as possible.  All the  fighting services had been represented on the Sub-Committee, and no divergence of opinion had been expressed in regard to the conclusions which had been reached.  These conclusions were summarised in paragraph 18 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report, the most importantrecommendation of which was to the effect that for communication between the UnitedKingdom and Australia and New Zealand  and the theatre of operations, in the eventof a war in the Far East, the following  minimum  provision of cable services was essential:         East-about:  One cable of the Eastern Telegraph  Company&apos;s system.        West-about:  Both trans-Atlantic cables and the New trans-Pacific  cable.    He emphasised that  the recommendations in the report were  confined to the strategical aspect of the question and contained no suggestion as to how the retentionof the cables referred to above was to be secured  He  understood that  the &quot; Beam&quot;wireless services had not  as yet been in operation  long enough to form a definiteestimate of the effect of their competition with the cables.  Though  much of the traffic originally carried by the Pacific cables had passed to the &quot; Beam &quot;  services,the former, he gathered, were at the present time still actually paying their way.    SIR   LAMING  WORTHINGTON-EVANS   and  SIR  GEORGE  MILNEstated that they had not had sufficient time to examine thoroughly the  recommenda-tions put forward by the Sub-Committee,  but in view  of the explanations given bySir Samuel Wilson, they  did not wish to raise any objections and thus delay the communication of the Report to  the Prime Ministers of the Dominions concerned.    SIR  CHARLES MADDEN said that the  Admiralty concurred in the report.    THE  PRIME  MINISTER pointed out that the Sub-Committee had only dealtwith the question from the purely strategical aspect,  and that the action that shouldbe taken  to put the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendations into effect was  a matter which would have to be considered by the Government concerned at a later date.

                                 Enclosure.SECRET.B.W C. (27)-8.                 COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.                    Imperial Communications Committee.SUB-COMMITTEE ON  COMPETITION  BETWEEN &quot; BEAM&apos;: WIRELESS                         AND CABLE SERVICES.                                  REPORT.     I.   IN  our  Interim  Report (Paper  No.  B.W.C.  (27)  6*) we dealt withparagraphs (a) and (b) of our terms of reference in full, and with paragraph (c) onlyin so far as communications between  the United Kingdom and Australia and NewZealand were concerned.  In this report we examine the application of the third paragraph of our terms of reference to  communications between other parts of  theworld.     For a full review of the situation our two reports should,  therefore, be read inconjunction,  though for the sake of convenience we have included towards the endof this paper a summary of the conclusions reached in our last report.     2.   In our present enquiries we were pleased to have the assistance of Mr.  H. J.Lenton, Postmaster-General of the Union of South Africa, who joined our Committeeand gave us  valuable advice in regard to communications with the Union of SouthAfrica.     3.   Before enumerating  the cables, which, we consider, should be maintainedfrom a purely strategic point of view, we wish to point out that,  as a basis for ourestimates, we have assumed that all Governmental communications of a secret or con-fidential nature  will be transmitted  by  cable, as well as any communications of aquasi-commercial character which might, if intercepted,  convey information of  use to an enemy.  It will be appreciated, therefore, that  the existing wireless services would only be employed for traffic, the general reception of which would in no waymilitate  against our national or imperial interests.   This basis has been assumed in the light of the working of wireless services to-day,  when interception and deliberate interference present few difficulties.   With improvements in directionaltransmission and reception, interception and interference will become increasinglymore difficult, and it may be found to  be justifiable  to entrust a correspondinglylarger proportion of messages to wireless transmission.  We suggest, therefore, thatour recommendations in regard to the numbers of cables to be maintained for purelystrategical purposes  should  be  reviewed  from time  to  time  in  the  light  of developments in wireless practice and performance.     4.   Further, we are informed that  on the main routes of  the cable systems ofthe world  there  are  always  some lines out of action  for  repair, &amp;c.  Withoutalternative lines, delays, sometimes of two or three weeks, would have to be expected,which in war time might be more frequent and considerably longer when inter-ruptions might be due to enemy action, and when the activities  of cable ships mightbe restricted.  We have, therefore, in our estimates made allowance for alternativeroutes.   The cables which we enumerate below are thus susceptible of classification,should such a course for any reason be considered advisable.    5.  Subject to these preliminary observations, we outline below the cables whichwe sviggest should be maintained for strategical purposes to the places indicated.It will be observed that only in the  case of India have we given an estimate of essential traffic in the event of an emergency.  The omission in the other cases isdeliberate, since  the capacity of the cables concerned exceeds the  amount  of traffic which it  is estimated will be involved.(a.) Mediterranean-Egypt.    The  requirements of the War Office and Air Ministry in the event of emergencyare likely to be heavy for communications to Egypt.  We recommend, therefore,,themaintenance  of one  E.T.C. cable, United Kingdom-Gibraltar-Malta-Alexandria,which will meet the needs of Gibraltar and Malta en route.                  * Also O.I.D. Paper No. 886-B and Paper No. I.C.Ol 916.      f16923]                                                      B 2
(b.) India.    The estimate in traffic with India (number of words per day) in the event ofan emergency is :     For Fighting Services and India Office :  27,000,  increasing to 44,000.    For other purposes: 40,000,* decreasing as operations develop.            (NOTE.* This figure is an estimate of the total commercial traffic to and         from India, excluding  traffic normally and likely  to  be  passing through         India to the Far East.)    We recommend,  therefore,  that  the  maintenance of two cables is essential,viz.:     2  lines of the  Eastern  Telegraph  Company:  United Kingdom-Gibraltar-         Malta-Alexandria-Aden-Bombay,with extensions:      (i.) One E.T.C.  Cable,  Madras-Singapore, to meet  wartime  requirements           between India and the Far East.    (ii.) One Government  of India Cable,  Karachi-Bushire-Fao (for Busrah),           calling at Jask  to meet requirements in  the event of operations in the           Persian Gulf.(c.) Africa.    The normal and  most expeditious route for traffic between the United Kingdomand the Union of South Africa is the E.T.C. Cable :         United Kingdom-Madeira-St. Vincent-Ascension-St.  Helena-Capetown,but this route suffers from the disadvantage  that it has two landings on foreignterritory.   We  deal generally with  this complication  later  in  our report (seeparagraph 6 below).    There is&quot; an alternative route  which avoids foreign territory,  viz :         Alexandria-Aden-Seychelles-Mauritius-Durban,but this route is  not normally employed  for European traffic  to and from SouthAfrica and its use would probably result in delays in communication, especially asit  passes through what must inevitably be a very congested area,  viz., Aden.    On the other hand a portion of this route will have to be maintained to providecommunication  with East African territories, viz.,  the  section         Aden-Seychelles with an extension to Zanzibar-Mombasa while  both sections  Seychelles-Mauritius and Durban-Mauritius form part  of alternative routes to  Australia (see sub-paragraph (f) below).    A third line  to  South  Africa is also available,  the maintenance  of the majorportion of which is required  for communication to British Territories on the west african Coast,  viz :          St. Vincent-Bathurst-Sierra Leone and thence down the coast to Capetown,    calling at all the principal ports en route.    We recommend,  therefore,  the maintenance of the  following lines to SouthAfrica:          (i.) Alexandria-Aden-Seychelles-Mauritius-Durban,with a branch :             Seychelles-Zanzibar-Mombasa,for communication with British territories in East Africa.         (ii.) United  Kingdom-Madeira-St.  Vincent-Ascension-St. Helena-Cape-                town,with a branch :              St. Vincent-Bathurst-Sierra Leone, &amp;c,for communication with British  territories in  West Africa.
 (d.) Canada and West Indies.     It will be remembered that in our Interim Report we arbitrarily allocated the two &quot; Imperial &quot; trans-Atlantic cables for traffic to Australia and New Zealand, and pointed out that these were the only two North Atlantic cables entirely under British control. We make some further observations on this latter point later in our report (see paragraph 6 (a) below).     It will thus be necessary to rely on the use of one of the numerous trans-Atlantic cables connecting England and Canada which are owned and worked (or in some cases leasecl  and worked) by the American Companies,  the  Western Union Telegraph Company and the Commercial Cable Company.  The possibility of these cables being driven out of use by wireless competition is extremely remote.   It is understood that  the  British and  Canadian  Governments  would  have power  in  time of war  to take over the  cables  (or  any  one of  them) and have  them  worked under  Government control.    Certain  of  these  cables   are  the  property of the Anglo-American  Telegraph Company (British), but are held on  a  99 years&apos; lease  from the  1st April,  1911,  by the  Western  Union Telegraph  Company (American).  These include a cable from Sennen  Cove,  Penzance,  to Bay Roberts, Newfoundland;  four cables  from Valentia,  Irish Free State, to Hearts  Content, Newfoundland;  and a  cable from Island Cove, Newfoundland, to North Sydney, Nova Scotia.  Other cables in the same group are landed at St.  Pierre (French) or in  the United States of America.     For communication with the West Indies and Central America, British cables connect Halifax,  Nova  Scotia, with Bermuda  (Halifax   and  Bermudas  Cable Company) ; Bermuda  with Turks Island and Jamaica (Direct  West India Cable Company) and Turks Island with  Barbadoes  (Government cable managed by the Pacific Cable Board).  Barbadoes is  the distributing centre for  communication by wireless in the Eastern group of Islands, and the retention of these  cables is considered necessary.     We consider, therefore, that it is  essential that there should be available for use or, if necessary, direct operation in time of emergency      One of the lines from United Kingdom-Canada (now  leased to the  Western         Union Telegraph Company), with extensions               (i.) Halifax-Bermuda-Turks Island-Jamaica ; and             (ii.)  Turks Island-Barbadoes. (e.) South  America.    We are advised by  the  representatives of  the Fighting  Services that the importance of communications with South American ports is  sufficient to justify the maintenance of cable communications. If this suggestion is approved the line:         United Kingdom-Azores-St. Vincent-Ascension-Buenos Aires, is recommended, with the  following alternative extensions :          (i.) Ascension-Rio de  Janeiro; or         (ii.) The Coastal  Cable Buenos Aires-Rio de Janeiro. It  will be noted that  the above main line  as far as  Ascension  duplicates that recommended for communication with South Africa in sub-para,  (c) (ii) above. (f.) Australia and the Far East.    In our Interim Report (Paper No. B.W.C. (27) 6*) in dealing with communica- tions to Australia and  New Zealand, we made no allowance  for  alternative routes, though we  pointed out that the  provision then recommended  fell  short of estimated requirements by 20,000 words  per  day.   We, therefore, now recommend that as alternative routes, the following cables should be maintained :          (i.) To Australia:              Mauritius-Cocos-Perth.         (ii.) To the Far East:              Cocos-Batavia-Singapore.    We think it advisable to draw attention here to the extension mentioned in  ourInterim Report from Singapore to Hong Kong.  This cable should be the one which runs via Labuan.                  * Also O.I.D. Paper No.  836-B and Paper No. I 0.0. 916.      [16923]                                                      B 3
     6.   In our Interim  Report  we laid considerable stress  on the advantages possessed by cables over wireless services in the greater freedom they enjoyed from interception.  But this  degree of superiority of cables  is  attained only when their landings are throughout on British soil and their operation is in British hands. Cable routes having landings in foreign countries cannot be regarded as immune from leakage.     A cable station in a foreign country, even if British  in ownership and operation, is subject to the jurisdiction of that country; and in war, if the country is neutral, restrictions and limitations may be imposed.   Unless special arrangements can be made, messages passed  through  these stations must, therefore, be regarded as liable to interception.     No specific regulations as to the employment of telegraph cables having landings in or passing through foreign countries were laid clown in  The Hague Convention of 1907.   It is understood, however, that in the late war satisfactory arrangements were made, and, in general, our cable  routes  did enjoy a considerable measure of security.     Nevertheless, though we have  endeavoured to confine our recommendations to cables which are british -throughout their length, we have not found it possible to exclude cables with  landings  in  foreign territory.  The cables affected in  this connection are:      (a.)  The Imperial trans-Atlantic Cable with a landing in the Azores.   This           cable is of ex-German origin, and its ownership has,  we understand, not           yet been finally settled.  We have been informed, however,  that for all           practical purposes it may be assumed that it will  remain in British           possession.     (b.) The E.T.C.  Cable, via Madeira and St. Vincent to South Africa.     (c.) The cable running down the West Coast of Africa to Cape Town.     (d.)  The cable from India to Fao, via Jask.     (e.) The suggested alternative route to the Far East, from Cocos via Batavia to           Singapore.     7.  We feel we should also draw  attention to the fact that, at the present timeall the main cables to the East have a landing at Alexandria.  (Beyond Alexandria,we  understand that  arrangements  are in hand to continue these cables by sea to port Said, whence they will be entirely in the Canal Zone as far as Suez.)    8.  We summarise  our conclusions  and  recommendations as follows :     I. Cables are required as indicated below  :              (NOTE. Landings  in  foreign territory are underlined.)        (a.) Mediterranean and Egypt.            One E.T.C. Cable.                United  Kingdom-Gibraltar-Malta-Alexandria.        (b.) India.            Two E.T.C.  Cables.                United Kingdom-Alexandria-Aden-Bombay;        with extensions :             (i.) Karachi-Jask-Bushire-Fao  (for Busrah).            (ii.) Madras-Singapore.        (c.) A frica.            Two main  lines to South Africa.                (i.) Alexandria-Aden-Seychelles-Mauritius-Durban ;        with a branch :                Seychelles-Zanzibar-Mombasa for communication with British                     territories in East Africa.                (ii.) United Kingdom-Madeira-St. Vincent-Ascension-St. Helena                       -Capetown;        with a branch :                St. Vincent-Bathurst-Sierra  Leone, &amp;c, for communication with                     British Territories in West Africa.
          (d.) Canada and West Indies.              One  Cable, now leased to  the  Western  Union Telegraph Company,                  which is American :                       United Kingdom-Canada,          with extensions:                    (i.^ Canada-Bermuda-Turks Island-Jamaica.                  (ii.) Turks Island-Barbadoes.          (e.) South A merica.                  One  cable,  United  Kingdom-Azores-St.  Vincent-Ascension-                      Buenos Aires,          with the following alternative extensions :                    (i.) Ascension-Rio de Janeiro; or                  (ii.) The  coastal cable, Buenos Aires-Rio de Janeiro.          (f.) Australia and the Far East.             The extension, Singapore-Labuan-Hong Kong, and          as alternative routes to  those mentioned in our Interim  Report (Paper             No. B.W.C. (27) 6):-*                      (i.)  To Australia:                          Mauritius-Cocos -Perth.                      (ii.)  To Singapore:                           Cocos-Batavia-Singapore.     The cables indicated above are shown in the form of a diagram in the Appendix to this Report.     II. Cable  routes with landings in  foreign countries cannot be regarded as immune  from leakage, and, therefore, where such  landings are  unavoidable, the superiority enjoyed by cable services over wireless is  diminished.  Landings in foreign territory affect the following cable routes:      (a.)  The Imperial Trans-Atlantic Cable No. 1 at the Azores.     lb.)  The E.T.C. Cable to South Africa at Madeira and St. Vincent.     (c.)  The cable running down the West Coast of Africa, to Cape Town.     (d.)  The extension from India to Bushire  at Jask.     (e.)  The alternative route from Cocos to Singapore at Batavia.     III. All the Cables to the East from the United Kingdom at present land at Alexandria.     IV. The cable requirements indicated above make allowance for breakdowns and  alternative  routes, and can, therefore, be classified, should such a course be considered advisable.     V. These recommendations  should be reviewed periodically in the light of developments in wireless practice which might make interference and interceptionmore difficult.     9.  For convenience of reference  we quote below a summary of the conclusions and  recommendations  contained in our Interim Report (Paper No. B.W.C. (27)  6*).     (1.)  Intentional interference with long-wave wireless services is unlikely to be          resorted to in time of war; but, for technical reasons in respect of speed          of working, long-wave wireless services cannot entirely replace short-wave          wireless or cable services.     (2.)  &quot;Jamming&quot; of the existing &quot;Beam&quot; stations is practicable.  To make          &quot; jamming &quot; more  difficult, further research,  with a view to improving          directional reception, is required.   A  serious effort to &quot;jam&quot; would          probably result, under present conditions, in the 11 Beam &quot; service having          to revert to all-round working at a much slower speed.    (3.)  &quot; Jamming &quot;  an &quot; all-round &quot; short-wave wireless station is  practicable up          to a point,  though some intermittent working will always be possible.                     * Also Paper No. 836-B and Paper No.  I.C.C. 916.
(4.) The extent of interference with cables in time of war will depend upon the      nature  of the war, the  relative position  of the belligerents, and the      strategical situation.  The Power which has obtained command of the sea      should be able to secure comparative immunity for its cable services.(5.) Cable services have a marked superiority over wireless services in respect      of secrecy.(6.) For communications between the United Kingdom and Australia and New      Zealand and the theatre of operations, in the event of a war in the Far      East, the following minimum provision of  cable services is essential:       East-about:  One cable of the Eastern Telegraph Company&apos;s System.      West-about:  Both trans-Atlantic Cables.  The New trans-Pacific Cable.          This  provision  will  fall   short of  estimated  requirements  by      approximately 20,000 words per diem,* and makes no allowance for traffic      to and  from Canada  and India.(7.) On  the assumption that no other cable  services  were available  the balance      of traffic  would have  to be carried by wireless.   It is, therefore,  of  the      first importance that all wireless communications should be under effective      British control.                                Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,                                    S.  H. WILSON, Chairman.(Signed)  NORMAN LESLIE, Secretary.2,  Whitehall Garden?, S.W. 1,    December 8, 1927.* NOTE. This deficit is now covered by the provision recommended in paragraph o(f) above.
