Copy No.   SOCP. 321 (27).IRAQ:  FUTURE OF THE  RAILWAYS.MEMORANDUM CIRCULATED BY THE ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    I CIRCULATE, for the consideration of the Cabinet, a memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office, on the subject of the future of the Iraq Railways.    I concur in the conclusion reached in the memorandum, namely, that, in all thecircumstances. His Majesty&apos;s Government should assist in  the reconditioning anddevelopment of the Iraq Railway system by guaranteeing a  loan, subject to a  priorguarantee by the Iraq  Government, in order to provide the necessary new capital for this purpose, viz.,  2,100,000.    The  memorandum was  prepared in consultation  with Sir George  Schuster.New capital is urgently required for the Iraq Railways, and I invite the Cabinet togive this matter early and favourable consideration.                                                                  W. 0.-G.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,          December 17. 1927.                       IRAQ :   FUTURE OF THE RAILWAYS.    1.  THE Iraq Railway system covers some ISO route miles in a country of long-distances and scattered population.   Superficially, at least, it is not an impressivesystem.  It savours  too much of makeshift.   Built  for the most part during thewar,  when speed and  not  durability was the governing factor, on an alignmentdictated by strategic rather than economic considerations  and from the materialnearest to hand, much  of which was already old when used, the system comprises amiscellaneous assortment of temporary structures, precarious bridges and ill-assortedrolling-stock.    For some five years after the Armistice the Iraq Railways were operated by theBritish Government  at a loss.   The Iraq Government assumed responsibility fortheir  management and administration as from the 1st April,  1923, for a period which will  come to  an end in December 1928, under the conditions  defined inArticle 8 of the Financial Agreement, the text  of which is given in the Appendix.    2.  It will be seen that this article provides that the Iraq Railways shall, indefault of prior sale or transfer, be transferred to the Iraq Government next year on terms to be mutually agreed, or, failing agreement, to be decided by arbitration.It also stipulates that His Majesty&apos;s Government shall not sell the Railways to any private purchasers except with the  concurrence  of the Iraq Government, &quot; whichshall not be unreasonably withheld.&quot;   It is understood that the Iraq Government,who have themselves advanced some  350,000 to the Railways to meet the  cost ofnew construction, would not in practice consent to their sale to a private purchaser.Sir H. Dobbs has definitely expressed the opinion that they would not.  They aresuspicious of concessionnaires in general, and it cannot be said that their suspicionsare unjustified by past  experience.  They are unwilling to see an essential  servicepass into the hands of a foreign commercial group, and apprehensive of the political influence which such  a  corporation might endeavour to exercise.  They would doubtless find many grounds superficially not &quot; unreasonable &quot; for withholding their consent until the time came when the transfer of the ownership of the system to their hands could no  longer be delayed.   The problem  before us  is to find, within  a      [16963]                                                        b
maximum  period  of some 13  months, a solution both  favourable to the british exchequer and consistent with our general responsibilities towards Iraq.     3.  The Financial Mission, consisting of Mr. (now Sir) E. Hilton Young,  M.P.,and Mr. R. V. Vernon, sent out to Iraq in 1925 to enquire, into the financial positionand prospects of the Government, dealt with the railway question in the following terms:          &quot; (o.)  The  ownership of the  railway system should be transferred to a     special body, having legal  personality (which  for convenience sake we call the     Corporation), to be constituted by a special statute of the Iraq legislature.         (b.)  The Corporation should&apos;thus become the owners of the system, and     responsible for its administration and management, with full  powers to charge,     lease or sell its assets, or  to make arrangements for delegating  management,     subject to the approval of the Government of Iraq.         (c.)  The capital stock of the Corporation should be 500 lakhs, divided into     250 Preferred stock, which should be the property of the British Government,     and 250 deferred stock, which should be. the property of the  Iraq Government.     The Iraq Government should have the option  to buy the British Government^     stock at par.         (d.)  The  Board  of the  Corporation should consist of  three  Directors     appointed by the Government of Iraq and two  appointed by the British Govern-     ment.   We  recommend that there  should thus be  a majority of  Directors     appointed by the Government of Iraq, in the belief that it is in accordance with     the general policy of the British Government  towards Iraq that  the affairs of     the  country should be under its  own general control.   We recommend that     during the Treaty period the appointment  of the  General Manager of the lines     should be subject to the approval of the British Directors. The British Directors     should remain as long as any stock of the Corporation remains the property of     the British Government.&quot;The Mission also  expressed the opinion  that the  railways would  require, in thecourse of the following four years, some 180  lakhs ( 1.350.000) of new capital, ofwhich some 80 lakhs ( 600,000) would be vitally necessary if the railways were tocontinue working.     4.  The Iraq  Government  accepted the  Financial Mission&apos;s  recommendations regarding the Railways in toto.  His Majesty&apos;s Government also accepted them,  inso far as they fixed the British  capital interest  in the railways at 250  lakhs( 1,875,000),  a considerable reduction on the figure at which  this interest had previously been assessed on the. basis of a valuation carried out in 1921; but they took exception to the proposal that the management of  the railways  should  beentrusted to a local board of directors.     5.  In  1926 it was  decided to invite Brigadier-General  F. D. Hammond, aneminent Consulting Engineer, who frequently worked for the Colonial Office in thepast, to  examine the whole question.  He was asked to report on the followingpoints:      (1.) The management and operation of the Iraq Railways.     (2.) The proposed programme of  development and the sum necessary to carry           out that programme.     (3.)  The sum necessary to put the existing system into a condition to cope satis-          factorily with the requirements of  traffic.     (4.)  The prospects of the railways becoming remunerative and the period which           is likely to elapse before &quot;they will be in a  position to  pay a full return           upon capital expenditure.     (5.) The possibility of the formation of a suitable Board of Directors in Iraq.     (6.)  The present establishment and  salary scales of the  Senior Staff of the           Railway Directorate.     6.  General Hammond arrived in Iraq  in November 1926, and presented his report in July of this year.  Of his general conclusions it is sufficient to  record hisopinion that, in the unusual circumstances in which the railways were working, theadministration was, in general,  as economic and as efficient as was  possible.  For thepurpose of this memorandum it is necessary to consider only those  of his conclusions which relate to the financing and administration of the system.  He considers that new capital, amounting to   2,100,000 is required to put the railway in a safe andworkable condition and to meet the cost of necessary  extensions and developments.
He points out that, if this new money were to be raised at 5 per cent., there would,in  accordance with  his forecast of  future  revenues,  be  an  annual  sum ofRs. 10 lakhs ( 75,000) for the remuneration of the interests which the British and iraq Governments hold in the property.  If. on the other hand, the money were to beraised at 8 per cent., the service of the new money would absorb the whole of the ne trevenue.  He concludes  this  section of his report by the following  words:          &quot; New money can only be raised at  5  per cent, on the Guarantee of  the    British Government.  If raised on the guarantee of the Iraq Government alone,    it would  be unwise to count on  a lower  rate of interest than 8 per cent.  I    therefore urge most strongly that the  British Government, subject, of course, to    a prior guarantee by the Iraq Government, should guarantee the new capital,    which amounts to  2,100.000 sterling, not only as the best method of* developing    the Railways and the.country,  but as the only means of ensuring a return on the    interest it holds in the property.&quot;    7.  This is General Hammond &apos;s  principal and most important proposal.   he further endorses the Financial MissioiFs proposal that the ownership of the railways should be transferred to a corporation which  should be locally constituted  andadministered by a local board of directors. He considers, however, that the board should consist of  five directors, of whom  the Director of the  Railways should beex officio chairman, and  that, of  the remainder, two should be appointed by  theBritish and two by the Iraq Government.    8.  In  the  event  of the British  Government  deciding not  to retain  itsproprietary interest, he recommends as an alternative  to the above  proposal that thesystem should be sold or leased to  a private corporation.  As has been pointed out.there is little likelihood of the Iraq Governments concurrence, which is an essential condition of the disposal of the railways to a private corporation, being obtained.    9.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have, therefore, to choose between  three alterna-tive courses :     (1.) To adopt Brigadier-General Hammond&apos;s proposal and to assist, by giving a           covering  guarantee,  in raising the  new  capital required to  put  the           railways on an economic basis;    (2.) To stand aside and to let the Iraq Government, unaided, attempt to raise           that capital  at the best rate of interest  they can obtain upon their own           credit; or    (3.) To transfer the ownership of the railwa3rs to the Iraq Government upon           terms to be mutually agreed or to be settled by arbitration.    10.  The first course is open to the objection that it would involve a fresh inroadupon British credit at a very inconvenient time. There is also the consideration that,given  Iraq&apos;s admission  to the League of  Nations in  a few years&apos; time, we should cease to exercise effective control over the country in respect of which our credit waspledged.  To the latter  point, however, it  may be replied that it will rest with HisMajesty&apos;s Government to decide the conditions upon which they will support Iraq&apos;scandidature to the  League.  Their  support would  clearly be conditional uponadequate securities for the full discharge by Iraq of her financial obligations, director indirect, towards this country.  It  has never been contemplated that the presentBritish advisory system  would disappear with Iraq&apos;s entry into the League.    11.   The counter considerations are these.  A covering guarantee by the BritishGovernment would ensure the raising of the necessary capital at 5 per cent.   GeneralHammond assures  us (and his forecasts in  these matters have generally proved to bewell within the mark) that, if money is raised at this rate, railway revenues, aftermeeting interest charges,  &amp;c, will show a surplus  sufficient to pay His Majesty&apos;sGovernment a substantial dividend on their capital.  Apart from this, the course proposed would be consistent with our general responsibilities towards  Iraq,  ashelping to establish on  a  sound basis a vital  public service.  It may no doubt be argued that we have already shown sufficient generosity towards Iraq.  Critics maypoint to the &quot;transferred assets &quot; (valued at  570,000) which we handed over gratisto the Iraq  Government and to the burden  that Ave have assumed by maintaining alarge British Air Force in  the country.  But the maintenance of a British Air Forcein Iraq is dictated at least as much by Imperial as by local interests.  As  regardsthe &quot; transferred assets,&quot; the generosity of  our action can hardly be taken at its face value.   They consisted in the main of war-time works  (bridges, roads, &amp;c.) under-taken  not for  the  good  of Iraq but for military requirements.  They could not be      [16963]                                                       B 2
 disposed of except to the Iraq Government.  In handing them over free of charge, after attempting unsuccessfully to exact a heavy payment, we were doing little more than making a virtue of necessity.  Moreover, there was no inconsiderable quid pro quo.  The transfer was conditional upon the Iraq Government accepting the. Turkish Treaty of 1926, which,  while it enabled His Majesty&apos;s Government to effect a large reduction of their garrison in Iraq, saddled the Iraq Government with a considerable liability to Turkey in respect of future Iraq oil royalties.     12.   It remains to consider alternatives  2 and 3.   Of these, the former has a certain superficial attraction.  Its effect would be to cut our losses.  But it  would mean abandoning all hope of any return, however small, on our heavy expenditure on the Iraq railways.  This is not the only possible objection.  The  Iraq  Govern- ment, on their own credit, could raise the necessary capital in Great Britain only on exorbitant terms.  The result  might  be that the Iraq Government, inspired by the recent example  of Turkey, would turn to Germany, with the consequence not only that  British firms would lose  the construction orders, but that the Iraq railways would pass under foreign control.  From an Imperial  point of view, such a con- contingency would  be disastrous.  It would mean that an important link in a possible &quot;all-British&quot;  route, between  the Mediterranean and  the  Persian Gulf would be definitely lost to us.  Our trade with Persia, already menaced by Bolshevik competi- tion and  hostility, would suffer still further  injury if  control over  the means of transport passed out of British hands.  The  position of our Air establishments in Iraq  would be seriously shaken if the railways, on which they depend  so largely for the maintenance of their  supplies,  became subject to foreign influence.  The  safety of the pipe-lines, by which the produce of the. new Mosul oilfields will be conveyed to the British fleet, would at least be compromised. We should be faced with a situation similar to that which prevailed before the. war, when we were at such pains to oppose the extension of a German-financed railway to the shores of the Persian Gulf.  To that extent the results of our immense efforts and sacrifices in this theatre of the war would have been neutralised.     13.  The third alternative calls for little comment.  The objections are clearly stated in General Hammond&apos;s report, in which this alternative is mentioned only to be ruled out.  He says :         &quot; Even in countries which have enjoyed representative government  for a    long time, political interference has proved the bane of state-owned railways.    The transfer of the  ownership to a  separate corporation, as in Canada, has    gone a  long way to eradicate this  evil, but in a country in which any  form of    representative government was unknown  until a few years ago, it is doubtful    in  the  extreme  whether  this safeguard would  be sufficient  to protect  the    administration.   So  long  as the  British  Government  retains  its proprietary    share  in  the corporation, its representatives  could  assure  that  no undue    interference Avas exercised, but, should that Government part  with its interests    and the undertaking  become the sole property of the Iraq Government, there is    grave danger that  the Directors of the Board would become merely political    nominees.  Under a Board appointed on  political grounds, the efficiency of  the    Railways  is bound  to deteriorate to  the  detriment, not only of  the Railways    themselves,  but of the country at large.&quot;    14.  By transferring the  ownership to  the Iraq  Government His  Majesty&apos;s Government would surrender all  proprietary  interest and  therefore all measure ofcontrol.  The  system would become a pawn of party politics; efficiency would  suffer to the detriment not only of Iraqi, but also of Imperial interests.   Moreover, since it is  pretty certain  that the two  Governments  would  fail to agree  the terms governing the  transfer,  the matter would have to go to arbitration.  Any arbitrator called in to assess the value of the railways  not as they exist to-day, but  as they would be  after a further period of deterioration, could  scarcely be expected to  setmuch value upon the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   Consequently, not only should we lose control of an important link in Imperial communications, not only should we incur the charge of neglecting our obligations towards Iraq, but we should lose all hope of any adequate return on our capital outlay.     15.  It is strongly  recommended that His Majesty&apos;s Government  should adopt the first course.Colonial Office, November. 16,1927.
APPENDIX. A Hide 8 of the Financial A greement made under A Hide 15 of the Treaty of Alliance               between Great Britain and Iraq of October 10, 1922.    HIS  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government hereby transfer to  the  Government  of Iraq as from the 1st day of April, 1923, -and for a period not exceeding four years from the ratification of the  treaty of alliance, the management  aud administration of the Iraq railway system, which shall remain  the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and the Government of Iraq hereby accept the responsibility for administering  and managing  the said system.    So long  as the  railways are administered and managed by the Iraq Government, all receipts of the Iraq railways will be kept separate from  the general revenues of Iraq and will be used solely for meeting (a) current expenditure of  the railway, and (b) in so far  as there may be any surplus of z-eceipts over such current expenditure, the cost of further capital works undertaken with the approval of the High Commissioner or the  payment of interest on money  borrowed for the  purpose of such capital works.  So long as the  railways are administered or managed by  the Government of Iraq,  His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government will do everything in their power  to obtain for that Government any advice or  assistance which  they may require, the cost of such  advice  or assistance being charged as a part of the current expenses  of  the railways.  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government will not sell the railways to any private purchaser within the period of  four years from the ratification of the treaty except with the concurrence of the  Iraq Government, which  shall  not be  unreasonably withheld, and the Iraq Government shall not within the same period lease the railways to any private lessee without the concurrence of  His Britannic Majesty*s  Government.  In the event of the Government of Iraq desiring within the  said period to  acquire the ownership of the railways, whether for the purpose of  selling or leasing them to any private purchaser or lessee  or otherwise, His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government shall state the terms upon which they will be prepared to transfer such ownership, and the transfer shall be made upon terms to be mutually agreed. In default of agreement as to such terms,  the matter  shall be  referred to  three  arbitrators,  of  whom  one  shall be appointed by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government and one by  the  Government of Iraq.  The third arbitrator shall be chosen by the other two arbitrators by agreement,or, failing such agreement, by the President of the Permanent Court of International Justice.   The arbitration shall take into consideration the expenses incurred  byHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in the construction, equipment and maintenanceof the railways, and the past, actual and prospective value  of  the railways to the Government and people of Iraq,  and shall decide what payment ought to  be madeby the Government  of Iraq to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government for the transferof ownership, and in what manner and at what dates, having regard to the general financial resources  and liabilities of Iraq, such payment ought to be made. HisBritannic  Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Iraq undertake to  accept and to give effect to the decision of the arbitrators.    His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Iraq agree that onthe expiry of  the period of four years from the ratification of the treaty of alliancethe ownership of the railway system shall, in default of prior sale or transfer,  beforthwith  transferred to the Iraq Government on terms to be mutually agreed, or,failing such agreement, to be decided by arbitration as hereinbefore provided.
