230(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PKOE&amp;TY OF HIS BiilTAlJHIC MAJJiSTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)COMMITTEE CH THE FUTURE OF BRITISH OOtMERCIAL AIR TRANSPORT.     1.   At their mooting on October 26th,  1.27, (Cabinet     52 (2?) Conclusion 8), the Cabinet had  before them a     memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air (Paptr     CP.  238 (27) )  dealing with the present position of     British Commercial Air Transport and agreed to the     appointment of a Cabinet Committee to review the question     composed as follows:-The President of the Board of Trade.                  (In the Chair)The Secretary of State for Air.Tho ?irst Lord of the Admiralty.The -First Commissioner of Works,The -Financial Secretary of the Treasury.The Terms of Referenoe of the Committee were:-          &quot;To review the present position of civil     aviation in the British -Empire, with particular     reference to reoent developments abroad and to     consider and report what modifications of our     present policy are desirable and practicable&quot;.2.   To enable us to fulfil our terms of reference wehave examined a number of witnesses official and unoifi-cial,  including Sir iric Goddes, the Chairman of imperial airways, Brigadier General Williamson of the Post Office,and representatives of the- Air Ministry.3.   Statistics comparing the progress of British andforeign civil aviation were given in the memorandum circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of Stale for&quot;S E C RE copy no cp. 327 (27)C A B I NET
                                                        23 Air referred  to in para.  1 above,  ar.d we 3o not think it necessary to  restate the position  in detail,      The salient faoi-s to which attention was drawn in that memorandum,  and whioh our invectigation  confirms, are firstly that  British air transport is lagging seriously behind  developments on the Continent and secondly that, without some  modification of the existing arrangements, there is no hope of this  situation being substantially remedied.      The cardinal  feature of British oivil  aviation policy in  the  past has  been the  concentration of air transport in  the  hands  of  a  single  company who enjoy  a  monopoly of  subsidy -  Imperial  Airways ltd,      -Te are satisfied  that  at the  present stage  of  civil aviation development this  policy is  sound and  should  be continued. 5.    It  is clearly,  however,  an  essential  condition  that a company  enjoying these advantages  shall  be  efficiently and economically managed.  &apos;7e took full  evidence  frcr, Sir  eric geddes  on the finances of  Imperial Airways, devoting parti- cular attention to  such nuestioos  as overhead  expenditure and administrative  charges.   ?7e are  generally  satisfiedthat the company complies with this  condition.6.   Imperial Airways has indeed made  steady  progress  overthe four years during which it has  boon  in existence and figures  were produced to us which  established  -     (a)  That there has heen a most satisfactory reduction          in running, cos to over the period as  a whole - a          reduotion from. 3s.2d. to  ls.lQd. per ton-mile          for  tho latost typo tnken into service - due          ^JI    1^2^ h o^i n t  oa uct i on^ i^mac h^n cs^ f^n ew          and  nprtq-date Osi/n and th::\t in consequence -
232      fb)   The  company  is  giving  a markedly  better  trcturn  in           ton-mileage  flown  for  the  amount  of  subsidy  it           receives  than its  French and  German  competitors  -           the  subsidy  rate per ton-mils flown  in France           working out  at    times  and that in Germany at           about 4 times our  own.-.     Tho evidence which v/e have had  before  us  makes itclear thst til at tho progressive improvement of the efficiency of the aircraft employed  by  the introduction of new typesis the chief direction in which a further reduction in working costs  can be secured, and the day whon civil aviationwill become self-supporting  brought nearer.7.   Y7e attach the utmost importance to this aspect of theproblom and recommend that the Air Ministry shall directspecial attention to the  improvement of the design ofnomrnarcial aircraft, and the research riecessarv therefor.We further recommend that in any rcvi.sicn of the existing contracts with Imperial Airways special provision should bemade to enable the company to renew its fleet  with machinesof more up-to-date design at frequent intervals.  Whilstwc arc informed that there is already regular  consultation between the Air Ministry,  Imperial Airways,  and the aircraftmanufacturing industry in matters affecting the design ofcommcericl aircraft, v/e recommend that, to ensure that thisrenewal is carried out at the proper moment and in the most effective manner possible, some permanent machinery shall beset up to secure an even closer liaison.8.   The progress described in para.  6 above and the figuresthere given are hopeful signs,  but v/e have reluctantlyreached the conclusion that,  under present arrangements whereby the first of a series of substantial progressivereductions in the subsidy is duo next year,  Imperial Airwaysoperations may, if no action is taken,  shortly bo in dangerof paralysis.   There is a fear th:.t either the company will                            -3-
233go  into liquidation  in the  early future,: or that, abandoningall attempt to  continue the further progressive developmentof  its technical equipment  (both aircraft and engines) and operational methods, whioh  is  essential  if the air transport industry is eventually to beoomo self-supporting, it willstagnate on the &quot;dole&quot; (so  to  call it) of the existingsubsidies wuntli its two existing contracts expiro in1931 and 1934 respectively.      In either event it is important to remember that notonly the oomnany hut also the  aircraft manufacturing industry as  a whole will be affected.   A healthy  industry is a mostimportant asset in Imperial Defence^ &apos; At tho present stage of  development, the orders  placed by civil air transport undertakings are necessarily only a small factor in theproblem, hut every eytension of civil air transport is of direct assistance to the industry,  and any diminution&apos;pro tanto&apos; weakens its position.   Kor  except on a very limited scale can the industry secure a market abroad forits commercial aircraft,  since the principal foreign countriesmake it a condition of subsidy that only aircraft of their national manufacture shall be utilised. &apos;9.   In short it appears unfortunately to be impossible to resist tho conclusion that finance is the main,  though notthe only key to the problem and that unless the  developmentof British civil aviation is to be abandoned,  a  revision ofthe existing agreements to provide for the continuance of asubstantial subsidy over a term of years so as to give thecompany reasonable security of tenure i3 inevitable.10.   In view of the scale on whioh  Foreign Powers aresubsidising their  air transport corranies - the  total provi-sion in French Estimates  for subsidy amounts this year to some three times,  and that in German Estimates to over ;&apos;ivc times the British figure - an3  the consonuent progress  of civilaviation abroad  as evidenced by the increased  mileage flown                            -4-
23and  opening up  of new routes, we regard it as impossible  forus to stanr?. still.  Moreover we find ourselves confronted bythe  &apos;fait accomoli1 of  our  existing commitments ?nd this  is a factor to which we have necessarily bad to give great weight.     There are  a number of  state-o-vnod aorodror.es in Englandand  in the Middle East  (including the ncin terminus at Croydonupon which a large ca.pj.tal  outlay hes been incurred), and weare bound by international  agreement to provide facilities at these aerodromes which involve a substantial annual expenditureon staff and maintenance generally.  It is unthinkable that weshould maintain these aerodromes for the sole use of foreign competitors,  and that British aircraft should virtually dis-appear from them.  Further  since wc are committed under existing contracts to a considerable expenditure on subsidiesover a period of years, it  seems to us important to ensurethat this money is so far as possible productively spent.If there is no  other alternative - and v/e have reluctantlyreached this conclusion - v/e think it preferable thst thepresent annual  expenditure  on subsidies ( 230,000) shouldbe somewhat increased with  a view to securing real progress -by which we mean tho development of improved types of machineend engine and the opening up of routes on which there islikely in due course to be  a paying passenger and/or mailtraffic - rather than that it should be frittered  away onuneconomic services operated by obsolescent machines,  which seems inevitable if the existing arrangements are  not modified.11,  As regards the question of routes the com pan;,- is atpresent operating (a) a nr.mber of services to the  continent and  (b) a service in the Middle East,  intended to  connectEgypt with India,  but so f?;r (owing  to difficulties  with Persia)  only  open between  Cairo aud  Basrah.     We were  impressed  with the evidence placed  before us as to the degree of success which  has attended this  latter
 servioe.   It  is olsar  that long distance  Imperial services are likely to  prove less unprofitable than short distance services to the Continent on which there  is necessarily very keen competition v.ith  existing means of transport and we advocate a policy of closing down the less remunerative of these latter  servioos  and concentrating on the great Imperial routes which  await development, in particular from England to India and  Scute Africa, for which Egypt is an essential Juncti one 12o  We recognise that the development of those Imperial services will  entail an increase in the amount of subsidy at present payable, but we are satisfied that they possess con- siderable commercial potentialities particularly from the point of view  of the carriage of mails *  Hor does their Importance end here.     We find that the natural commercial routes to India and beyond and to  South Arfiea are virtually conincident with the great strategic lines of air communication which are essential if our Imperial air forces are to possess the full mobility which is required for their economical disposition at selected centres,  whence they will ultimately be able to reinforce any threatened point with a minimum of delay.  If it is necessary on strategic grounds that we should possess and maintain available for instant use a long chain, of aei-odromes between the different points of the Empire,  it is clearly better that they should not lie fallow against emergency,  but be put to profitable use in time of peace.  It is important to appreciate that,  if civil aviation were abandoned tomorrow,we should still have to develop and maintain these aerodromes and the requisite facilities for purposes of defence.  Thisis only one of a number- of points at which military and civilaviation react closely one upon the other.  Our attention has, for example,  been drawn to the need for the early development of British air transport in Egypt,  where the present exclusion of foreign air transport companies,  which is desirable both on strategic and  other grounds,  is likely to become politically
                                                          236impracticable in the near future.13.  Sir Eric Geddes outlined to us a scheme for a weeklyair mail service between London and Calcutta and we recommendthat a commencement should be made with this service and thatthe Air Ministry should be axithorised, in consultation withthe Treasury, to negotiate nn agreement with tho company forits operation as part of a comprehensive revision of the two existing contracts.  iVhilst it is difficult to form exactestimates of the renenue which should accrue from this sorvicowhen fully in operation, it is clear from tho evidence of thePost Office representative that it should be substantial.   a condition of operating this service Imperial Airwayswill no doubt demand security of tenure over a considerable period, and we think that in return for such security of tenure, the Company should agree to a modification of theexisting profit-sharing arrangement with the Government,whereby the exchequer should receive a larger proportion of available profits at an earlier stage than at present.   this might take the form of  Government participation in profitseither (a) from the start, whatever their e.mount, or(b) after the shareholders have received a materially lower rate of dividend than that at present provided for.  V7erecommond that the Air Ministry,  in consultation with theTreasury, should give special attention to this matter.14.  It remains to consider the most important questionof the financial effect of our proposals.  We should be most reluctant in the existing financial stringency to make any recommendations which would impose an additional  burdrn onthe Exchequer.  The Secretary of State for *JLr, however,anticipates &quot;that as a result of estimates being relieved bythe completion of certain works at Croydon and other capitalservices, he would be able to give effect to our recommendationsif the Cabinet wer-&apos; prepared to authorise the stabilisationover a 10 year poriod of the Civil Aviation Vote of
237Air Estimates  (Vote 8) at approximately its present figureof  500,000.   The e?act amount in 1927 Estimates is  464,000,this being  the net figure after credit has been taken forreceipts from  landing fees etc.  We understand that it isthe Secretary  of St?te&apos;c intention that the average annualprovision of  500,000 over a ten year period should &apos;be calculated  on the same basis, and that he contemplates thatthe programme  in any particular year should be made thesubject of  detailed discussion with the Treasury preciselyas at present.     Whilst we appreciate the need for the Cabinet to agree toat least a  ten-year period,  if any considered scheme of deve-development  is  to  be formulated,  we are not prepared to reooramendany specific sum,, since we think this can only be doterminedin the light of the amount of subsidy for which a satisfactory-agreement can be negotiated  with Imperial Airways by theAir Ministry and Treasury in consultation.     We suggest, however,  that the military and civil votes of Air Estimates should  he regarded as a whole and that Itshould be understood that the stabilisation of Vote 8 at some such figure as that recommended by the Secretary of State forivir should be contingent on  there being no resultant increasein the total Exchequer provision for Air Services.     We make no recommendation as to the treatment of anyreceipts from the proposed London-Calcutta mail service,since their disposal must  necessarily be contingent on the precise character of the contract negotiated  with imperial airways Ltd*
233               SUMMARY 0? ifoCQEV^ATIOHS.15,  Our recommendations to the Cabinet may thereforebe summarised as follows:-     fa)  That the policy of concentrating air transport          in the hands of a single company - Imperial          Airways Ltd . - be continued.     (b)  That the Air Ministry be authorised in consultation          with the Treasury to enter on negotiations with          Imperial Airways to modify the existing agreements          so as to provide :-          (l)  For giving the company security of tenure               over a reasonable period of years.          (2)  For the development,  in  lieu of the less               remunerative continental services, of long-               distance Imperial routes,  commencing with a               Lon-ion-Calcutta mail  service.          (3)  For the renewal of the company&apos;s fleet at               fx&apos;equent intervals with  the most&apos;up-to-date               aircraft.          (4)  For the Government to secure more favourable               participation at an earlier stage in the               company^  profits.     (o)   That the Post Office should take special steps          to promote  the  sueoess of  the London-Calcutta          Mail Service.     (d)   That over a 10  year period  a  sufficient amount          should  be provided  on the  Civil  Aviation Vote          of Air  Estimates  to permit  of the policy outlined          at (l),  (2),  (3)  and  (4) of (b)  above being          carried into  effect - the  figure  to be settled          annually between  the  Air Ministry and  Treasury,
     to whom each yc-ar&apos;s programme will bo co.munica.toc3     for prior scrutiny and  concurrence in the ordinary     oourss.(e)   That machinery should be  sot  up to secure the     closest possible liaison  between the  Air Ministry,     Imperial Airways and the  aircraft manufacturing     industry.
