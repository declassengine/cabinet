CABINET.FORESTRY POLICY.Treasury Morr.orandi.uii on the paper prepared by the forestry Commissioners.     (CP. 306  (27)).Circulated by direction of the Chancellor           of the Exchequer.1,   It vrill be remembered that the Forestry Act  of1919, basing itself on the report of the Acland Sub-Committeeof the Ministry of Reconstruction in 1916-17,  set up anindependent Forestry Commission with a  statutory  programme for the decennium 1919-1928.   The Commissioners were placed in the unique position of controlling an as sirredprovision of  3-jg- million during the ten years.   Recentvotes have given them           In 1926            385,000           In 1927            595,000and they have been promised           For 1928           485,000.     By the end of the deeermium it Is  estimated thatafforestation operations will have extended to  a total  of250,000 acres, including 100,000 acres  dealt with by individuals or municipalities, aided by grants.2.   The main idea&apos; which gave rise to the creation ofthe F orestry Commission was the principle laid  down by  theAcland Sub-Gommlttee of 1916-17 that the country must bemade self-supporting as regards timber  in any future war
emergency not exceeding three years&apos;  duration,   This wasa war idea and is now obsolete.   Just as  it has beendecided that the nation cannot afford to grow wheat  sufficientto suppcrt life in a future war, so it must now borecognised that we cannot afford to become self-supporting as regards timber.   It would be necessary,,if there were a war, to keep the seas open for wheat,.and it will therefore be possible to  import reasonable                                  ownsupplies of timber to supplement our/produce, if required.3.   The question -:f afforestation must, therefore,now be considered mainly on the basis of peace needs.Even though the state of the woodlands is  now worse  than was imagined by the Acland Committee, the mere possibility that timber may reach famine prices at some future-o datedoes not justify afforestation by the State on the &quot;lairjjrum5&apos;scale of 330,000 acres in ten years,  as contemplated by the forestry Commissioners.   If, as stated, the return  onforestry operations is only     to 4^ at present prices,this means a net loss, as money costs nearly S/oj and wecannot afford to gamble on the reduction of the loss by a future increase of prices, especially as land forafforestation is becoming dearer to buy and there is always apossibility of other materials supplanting   wood and woodproducts as prices rise,4,   Gn the other hand, afforestation and forestholdings are popular, and public, opinion would be againstthe abolition of the Commis^i6&apos;n^.i.despite the strongrecommendation of the Geddes Committee that this shouldbe done.   The Commission can only conduct their operationseconomically if they have funds provided for some years ahead, so that they can prepare nurseries, and c-dls pose
 effectively  of  land and staff.   The Treasury have  therefore agreed to  place the sum of   5,500,000  at the disposal  of the  Commission  over the ten years  commencing 1929-50.  This sum  should enable  the  Commission to plant  200,000 acres during the period  (*in  addition  to  60,000 acres  to be p?anted by Corporate bodies and and private owners) and to  spend  about  1,000,000 on forest holdings.   Alternative methods of spending the money  are  detailed  in paragraph 5  of the memorandum of the Commission. 5,,   In the  opinion of  the  Treasury the limitation  of expenditure  to  this  sum can be defended without  difficulty in Parliament,  on the grounds that (1) the war  policy must be modified; (2) even so, the Commission is being allowed more than  a  50/* increase of voted  income in its  second decennlum, and  will  in  addition be receiving a  larger income each year  from  forest products;  and (3) the Commission is being  granted stifficient money to  plant as many acres in the second decennium as  in  the first, despite increased costs,  and to provide for forest holdings at the maximum annual  rate hitherto reached,,   Having regard to demands for money  fr-orn otlrsr quarters,  and to  the general financial position,  the Treasury  cannot consider that any greater expenditure  than  5,500,000 is justified on afforestation during  the period referred to. 6,   There is no need to seek legislative authoritybefore  adopting this programme;   , Money can be   provided on the ordinary Estimates and paidv&amp;nto the Forestry Fundwithout any new Act,   A ten years  &apos; executive programme is for all purposes of securing continuity of administration and certainty of progress as effective as a ten years f statutory programme u   There can be no fear of  agreed policy
being endangered by the luck of the polls for all partieare agreed in the support of afforestation.   And therecertainly no advantage in wasting part of a crowdedParliamentary session in renewing the exceptional Act of1919.     Nor is there any need to take an Act to alter the somewhat anomalo\is internal constitution of the forestry commission.   It works satisfactorily in practice.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.   December 9th, 1927.-4^
