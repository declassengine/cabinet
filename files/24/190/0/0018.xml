(THIS DOCUMENT  IS  TEE  PROPERTY  OP HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) SECRET                                                Copy No.__ cope .319  (27).                           CABINET                      I3ISH CLAIMS COi-IMITTSE.                            REPORT.                At their Meeting  on 30th  November,  1927  (Cabinet          59 (27) Conclusion 6),  tho  Cabinet  agreed  that a  Cabinet          Committee,  composed  of  -                    Tho Chancellor of the Exchequer                    T^e lord Privy Seal                    The President  of  the  Board  of Education                    The Attornoy-Goneral          should meet to consider  and report  to  the  Cabinet  on  the          subject of the awards of compensation  for  the  claims  of          Irish loyalists.               We have had before  us  two  alternative proposals          (l)  That of the Dominions  Office,  that the recommendations          of the Wood-Renton Committee should be paid in full.  On          the most liberal  estimate,  as framed by the Committee          themselves,  this would  cost approximately  il,160,000.  The          Dominions Office, taking a more o-ptimistic view, calculate          the total cost at about   900,000.          (2)  That of the Treasury,  that the recommendations of the          Committee should be scaled down on  the same priaoiPle as          was applied by the  Scunner Commission  in 192-1  to claims  by          British subject on account  of enemy action during the War.          Tho &quot;Sumner scale&quot; is as follows:-               On the first x.250 of every assessment   -  IQOJb               On any excess of x250 up to *:1,000      -   50^               On any excess of ^1,000 up to x50,000   -.  ZOfo
          It is estimated that the application of this scale to  a total assessment of  1,160,000 will cost approximately   627,500;   if the total assessment should rrove t0 be only   900,000, the cost according to the above scale will be  reduced tc, say  ( 575,000).          In favour of the Temj.;tions Office proposal, it wao  represented:-          fi) That the Government are publicly and unequivocally             pledged to see that &quot;full and ample justice is* done             in ail cases&quot;, even if that should, involve &quot;consid-             erablo demands upon the people of this country&quot;;        (ii) That the Dunedin Report informed the nation what,             in the opinion of a most distinguished .ju2ge and             impartial critic, it v.-as the duty of the Government             to d&apos;. in crdrar to carry out that pledge;       (iii) That, although the Cabinet had in mind, when             setting up the Wool-Renton Ccmmittec.  that the             total expenditure should not exceed  400,000,             no public announcement of that or any other             limit was made at the time, and that in this             respect the position differs fundamentally from             that of the victims of German aggression, for             whom a limited sum of money was set aside by             the Government to be distributed pro rata:        (iv) That the Committee have rejected more than half             the claims submitted to it and that the great             majority of tho claims admitted a3 valid have             been those made by comparatively poor persons *          (v) That payment in full is the least that the             Government can do,  in justice to the unfortunate             claimants concerned, and to save themselves and             the -Party from a grave  loss of reputation-                   On the other side it was urged(i)  that from a legal point of view the effect of the pledges was not such as to bind the  Government to pay therecommendations of the Y/ood-Renton Committee in full without regard to other considerations.           It was impossible now to  go back to the  basis of strict legal right, because- the  Dunedin Report had recommendedthat the claims should be dealt with on the basis,  not of legal right, but of hardship.    The  Government,  in setting upthe Wood-Rentcn Committee to advise  them what ought to be paid on this basis,  had decided that  in
 no circumstances should tho total cost exceed  400,000; and tho members of the- Committee  had &quot;been told  of this limit &quot;beforehand.    Tho Committee however had proceeded  to advise the Government  on quite  a  different &quot;basis.   Tho Government eotilc&apos;. net ho bound to  accept such advice auto- matically;   the Committee  themselves roecgnised  freely that their function was only to make recommendations.   The Government were entitled to hrvc  regard to the  general financial  position;  and it was clearly open to  them to apply the  Sumner scale to  tho recommendations of the Committee  if they  thought  fite (ii)   that tho representatives  of tho Loyalists  on the Sunedin Committee  fully recognised at the  time  that the Government could not bo  expected,  to  accept  the recommendations. of the Wbcd-Reiitou Committee without any regard  to financial  and other  considerations,  (see p,  9, para. 2 of the Report &quot;The  decision as to  &quot;hat  grants must  ho made to injured  persons must rest  with  the Government themselves, but in arriving  at  their decision  they should have the jtdvice of a  Committee.. a ... - &quot; ); (iii)   that  the financial  position of  the country  was serious  and  that additional luxation must be avoided; (iv)   that,  of the total amount awarded  by the Committee, approximately 60;% v;0uld  be  payable in  about 1 0  cases  of awards  of  1,500 and upwards, out  of  the total of  about 1,600  cases.  It was therefore in  only about 10$ of tho total number of eases that  the Stunner  scale would involvea reduction  of as much as  50$;   in 900 cases, of 56$,payment would be made in full:   and, in another 300, or19$, payment would  be 75f&apos;o or pore  of tJ.:-.o recommendation-
        Having carefully considered these arguments theChairman and the Attorney-General have agreed to make thefollowing recommendations &quot;ko the Cabinet -            fi) The Sumner scale should he applied to the                assessments recommended by the Yfcod-Renton                Committee;           (ii) An immediate announcement should be made of                the Governmentrs decision;           (iii)In order to relieve cases of hardship as far                as possible, the Dominions Office should be                authorised to make immediate payment on the                above scale in all eases in which the Committee                have completed their Investigations, and to                mako advances on the Committee^ recommendation                where necessary in other cases;          (iv)  An additional sum of  25,000 should be placed                at the disposal of the Dominions Office, to                supplement tho Sumner soale in cases of                exceptional hardship on the recommendation                of the Y/ood-Ronton Committee o       THE LORD PRIVY SEAL  and THE PRESIDENT 0? THE BOARD OPEDUCATION&quot; desire to express thoir dissent from these recommend-ations and will state their views orally to the CabinetoSigned on behalf of the Committee     WINSTON So churchill..
