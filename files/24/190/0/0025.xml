 REPORT  OF  SUB-COMMITTEE OF  THE  COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL     DEFENCE  ON THE INDIANISATION  OF  THE  INDIAN ARMY.                 (As AMENDED AND APPROVED BY THE CABINET.)     AT the request of the Secretary of State for India, the Cabinet, at a meeting- held on the 23rd November, 1927 (Cabinet 57 (27), Conclusion 14), agreed to recom- mend  to the Prime Minister that a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence should be set up to examine and report  on the proposals recently  received from the Government of India relating to the Tndianisation of the Indian Army.     2.  Accordingly our Sub-Committee was set up, composed as follows:          The Rt. Hon. The  Earl of Balfour, K.G.,  O.M., Lord  President of  the             Council (CJiairman).         The Rt. Hon. W. S. Churchill, C.H., M.P., Chancellor of the Exchequer.         The Rt. Hon. Sir John Gilmour, Bt., D.S.O., M.P., Secretary of State  for             Scotland (representing the Secretory of State for War).&apos;         The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Birkenhead, Secretary of State for India.         The Rt. Hon. Sir Samuel Hoare,  Bt., G.B.E., &quot;C.M.G., M.P., Secretary of             State for Air.         The Rt. Hon. Viscount Peel, G.B.E., First Commissioner of Works.     3.  Field-Marshal  Sir  Claud  Jacob, Secretary,  Military Department, India Office.  General Sir George Milne, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and Air Vice- Marshal Sir Philip Game, Air  Member for Personnel, were invited  to take part in our  deliberations.  In addition, the Secretary of State for India laid before us the views of his Council.     4.  In order that the proposals of the Government of India, and  our conclusions in regard to them, may be the more readily understood, we set out in the following paragraphs  a brief historical summary.     5.  Prior to 1918 Indians  were not eligible to hold the King&apos;s  Commission in His Majesty&apos;s Land Forces.   In that year, however, in recognition of the part taken by Indians in the Great War, this commission was, for the first time, declared open to them.     6.   The following passage in the Montagu-Chelmsford Report on Constitutional Reforms, which was published in 1918, is relevant:         !i There remains one item, the  importance of which, in the eyes of India,     outweighs all others.  British commissions have for the first time been granted     to Indian officers.....The services of the Indian Army in the war  and the     great increase  in  its size  make  it necessary that a  considerable number  of     commissions should now be given.&quot;     7.  With a view to providing Indian  candidates  with the necessary military training, a  cadet school,* with accommodation for 50 cadets, was established atIndore, in India,  and, in addition, ten vacancies a year were allotted to Indians at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.   But no definite policy was formulated at that time as to  the  ultimate  employment  of  Indians who  graduated at these establishments.    8.  In 1921 the Legislative Assembly adopted the following resolutions : t    (a.)  &quot; That the King Emperor&apos;s Indian subjects should be freely admitted to all            arms of His Majesty&apos;s military, naval and air forces in India and the            ancillary  services and the  auxiliary forces; that  every encouragement            should be given to Indians including the educated middle classes             subject to the prescribed standards of ntness, to enter the commissioned         .   ranks of the Army.....&quot;   * This school was only an expedient to meet the special needs of ilie war, and it was closed afterone year&apos;a existence.                          t Resolution 7 of -March 28, 1921.      [16921]                                                       B 2
    (6.)  &quot; That not less than 25 per cent, of the King&apos;s commissions granted every            year should be given to His Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects to start with.&quot;    9.  In 1921 and 1922 the Government of India submitted various recommenda-tions  for extending Indianisation in  the Army.  These  were examined by a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial  Defence, whose Report* on the wholequestion of Indian Military requirements was approved by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin January  1923.  For convenience of reference, that portion of  the Report which deals  with Indianisation is reproduced as Appendix A.    10.  Special  attention  is invited to the conclusion contained in paragraph130 (a) :-        &quot; 130 (a.) A start should be made at once so as  to give Indians a fair    opportunity of proving that units officered by Indians will be efficient in every    way.  Accordingly, eight units of Cavalry or Infantry should be selected, to be    officered by Indians, as now suggested by the Government of India.&quot;     11.  The scheme contemplated in the above conclusion to which we shall here-after refer as &quot; the eight-unit Scheme &quot; was described! in the Legislative Assemblyby the late Lord Rawlinson in the following words :          &quot; The Government consider that a start should be made at once so as to give     Indians a  fair opportunity of proving that  units officered  by Indians will be     efficient in every way.   Accordingly  it  has  been decided  that  eight  units     of cavalry  or  infantry be selected to be officered by Indians.  This  scheme will     be put into force immediately.   The eight units to be wholly Indianised will be     mainly infantry units, but there will be a  proportion of cavalry. They will be     chosen judiciously so as to include  as many representative types as possible of     Indian battalions and cavalry  regiments of the Indian Army.  Indian Officers     holding  commissions in the Indian Army  will be  gradually transferred to     Indianising units so as to fill up the appointments for which they are qualified     by their rank and by their length of service, and the process of  Indianising these     units will then continue uninterruptedly as the  officers gain seniority and fitness     in other respects, which will qualify them for the senior posts.....There is     one other point, however, which it is necessary for me to explain.   It is that,     simultaneously with the Indianisation of these selected eight units, Indians who     qualify for the King&apos;s Commission  will continue, as at present, to be posted to     the other, units of the Indian Army.  The number of Indian cadets  now sent to     Sandhurst: each year, if all pass&apos;out successfully,&apos; is more than sufficient&quot;t6 replace     the normal wastage in the eight utiits alone/1  &apos;   &quot;  &quot;&quot;  &apos;&quot;&apos;  &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;    &quot; aU     12.  The scheme was put into operation  forthwith.   It is  to be noted that it made no difference to the pace at which the number of officers receiving the King&apos;commission was increased; there was no advance upon the ten vacancies originallyallotted at Sandhurst;  and Indians were still ineligible to be employed as King&apos;sCommissioned Officers in the artillery or engineers of the Indian Army, or in theair  force.     13.  In Julyl  1924, the Government of India  made recommendations for      (a) the admission of Indians to the  Royal Air Force  and  to Indian units of           artillery and engineers;  and     (b) an increase from ten to sixteen in the number of vacancies at Sandhurst.But before a reply had  been sent to these recommendations, the Secretary of Statereceived the proposal of the Government of India to appoint the Committee, whichwas eventually known as the Indian Sandhurst Committee. The  correspondencerelating to the  appointment of this Committee is attached as Appendix (B).     14.  The Reportg  of  the  Indian  Sandhurst Committee  was published inNovember 1926.  The Government  of India, after  consultation  with the Secretaryof State,  prefaced this  Report  with a  foreword, in which they indicated that it* C.I.D.

219I Telegram No. 1173 S of 18th July, 1927. might be necessary to  explore other lines of increasing Indianisation  than those winch had hitherto been followed.  They also stated that the Report would be used &quot;as a starting point for discussion with His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;     15.   With the Indian Sandhurst Report itself, it is unnecessary for us to deal, since the Government of India have not accepted its main recommendations which they describe!  as &quot;insufficiently considered and in consequence ill-founded.&quot;   But, acting on the statements published in  their foreword, they have now submitted the proposals which form the subject of our enquiry.  These are set out in full in their telegram of the 18th July, as supplemented by their despatch of the 13th October. The relevant correspondence is attached as Appendix (C).     16.   Before proceeding to discuss their proposals in detail we desire to draw attention to certain fundamental aspects of the situation.  In the  first place,  it is necessary to recognise that, whatever the arguments against the Indianisation of the Army and they are manifold and powerful we are deeply, in fact, inextricably, committed to this policy by our decision in 1923, at all events, to the  extent of giving Indians  &quot;a fair opportunity of proving that units officered  by Indians  will be efficient in every way.&quot;  The experiment is still under trial in the eight units; and it cannot be said that it has failed, and must be abandoned.    17.  In the second place, there are definite grounds against  leaving matters where they now stand.  The Indian Sandhurst Committee was appointed with the concurrence of the  Secretary of State; their Report has been published and discussed with the full knowledge that  it involves reopening  the question of Indianisation; and the foreword of the Government of India contains  a clear promise,  which has since been endorsed hy the Secretary of State in the House of Lords,  that the Report will be used as a starting point for discussions with His Majesty&apos;s  Government.    18.  Moreover, apart  from political considerations,  we have learned that we are within measurable  distance of the  time when the output of Indian cadets from Sandhurst will exceed rhe requirements of the eight units, as at present  organised. At no  distant  date, therefore, we  must either cease gradually or wholly to send Indians to Sandhurst (which would have a disastrous effect on Indian opinion), or distribute the cadets over the rest of the Indian Army (which would have a disaterous efect on British recruitment, and possibly on efficiency).    19.  We regard the latter contingency  as particularly objectionable, since we have been told  that there is already ah alarming and growing, shortage  of  British candidates of  the  right stamp for commissions  in the  Indian&quot; Army:   There are many explanations for this shortage, but the most important of these is,  we under- stand, the reluctance of parents to send their sons to serve under Indians, or live their lives with Indians  as messmates.    20.  Something, therefore, must be done; and the view put before us by theSecretary of State for India, after full examination in his Department, is that the Government of India &quot;have succeeded, on the whole,  in dealing comprehensively, and on lines of safety,  with a  situation which, owing to the necessities of the case,has hitherto been treated partially, and which will  inevitably present us not only with immediate embarrassments,  but even with  some positive elements of danger,unless its anomalies can be corrected.&quot;   With that view we agree.    21.  Turning  now to the  details of the recommendations put  forward by the Government of  India, these may be summarised as follows :     (1.) The  ultimate  goal of Indianisation should be in  the creation  of a self-          contained Dominion Army, in which the Commissioned officer will hold a          King&apos;s  (India) commission,  and Units will be organised on the model of          British Battalions-with homogeneous officer establishments, instead of two          distinct types of commissions.&quot;     (2.) The issue of King&apos;s Commissions to Indians trained at Sandhurst should          be continued for the present.
  (3.) The &quot; Eight Units &quot; system should be maintained, and the number should       hereafter be expanded as may be necessary.  (4.) Indians who enter Sandhurst  in future should be posted to  Indianising       units (a) in vacancies of British Officers until such vacancies are no longer       available; (b) thereafter, in place of Viceroy&apos;s commissioned  officers.  (5.) The  vacancies  for direct  commissions  through  Sandhurst  should be       increased to 20 per annum, and five further vacancies  -should be given       annually to Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers who pass through Sandhurst.  (6.) Eight annual vacancies at Woolwich should  be given to Indians.  Those       who pass  out from Woolwich should receive King*s Commissions, as  now       granted to Indians passing out from Sandhurst.  (7.) Two annual vacancies  at Cranwell should be given to Indians.  The form       of commission to be given to Indians who pass out from Cranwell should       be reserved for further consideration.  (8.) The question of the establishment of an Indian Military College should be       postponed  until  Sandhurst is no longer capable  of absorbing  Indian       Cadets in the numbers forthcoming.  (9.) An overseas element should be created in the existing pay of Indian Army       officers, and Indians entering Sandhurst  under the new system should be       ineligible for this element.(10.) Scholarships should be  instituted  to enable  Indian  boys to meet  the       expenses of education at Sandhurst, Woolwich or Cranwell.(11.)  The official guardian at Sandhurst should be a serving officer.(12.)  Any deficiency in the forces available for the defence of India due to lesser       efficiency of completely  Tndianised units should be made good either by       additional British  troops or by additional  Indian troops with British       officers.    We will discuss the above proposals seriatim.    22.  Recommendation No. 1. The first step should be the organisation of the           units selected for Indianisation on the model of British battalions, with           homogeneous officer establishments, instead of  two  distinct  types  of           Commissions.   The Commissioned Officers in these units should hold a           Ki?ig&apos;s (India) Commission.    It should;be.remembered that the system on which the Indian Army,is at.presentorganised&apos;is a&apos;hybrid, as is inevitable when native troops  are commanded by alienofficers,  and for linguistic and other reasons the contact between  the junior officersand the rank and file cannot be nearly so close as that between the British subalternand his men in a  British Unit.  The gap in the Indian Army is filled by a class  ofmen known as Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers, who act as intermediates betweenthe King&apos;s commissioned  officers and the rank  and file.    These are  selected bypromotion from the ranks, and hold a position above that of a Warrant Officer in aBritish regiment, but below that of the King&apos;s commissioned officer.   In proportion as Indians take the place of British in the King&apos;s commissioned ranks of a section  ofthe Indian Army, the necessity for maintaining  this intermediate  class of officerdisappears.   If  the  nucleus of  an   Indian  National   Army is  ever  to  be developed, it is essential that the junior officers should maintain the same kind  of close contact with their men as is expected of a British subaltern  in  a British unit.The proposal of the Government of India to eliminate the Viceroy&apos;s Commissionedofficer from Indianising units therefore appears  logical.    It has  the additionaladvantage  that it  widens  the  scope  of Indianisation  without necessitating anincrease in the eight units, at any rate, for some time to come.  In these circumstances we see no objection to an  announcement that  the Governments policy is to give better opportunities for the advancement of  Indian Officers in the development of a force  within the Indian Army officered  by  Indians, provided that  it  is  definitelyrequired that the process is strictly contingent on the success achieved in the various stages of the experiment.  We also agree that the units in  which  the experiment  ofIndianising is to be tried should be organised on the model of British Battalions withhomogeneous officer establishment instead of two distinct types of Commissions.
     23.  Recommendation No. 2. The issue of King&apos;s Commissions to Indians            trained at Sandhurst should be continued for the present.     At present Indians passing out of Sandhurst are given exactly the same form of commission as other cadets, namely, the King&apos;s Commission in His Majesty&apos;s Land Forces, which carries power of command  over all personnel, whether  British or Indian, in those Forces.  The commissions granted to Dominion officers, on the other hand, carry power of command only in  the Dominion  Forces. We agree  with the Government of India that, under their present proposals, India ought to be put on the same footing in this respect as the Dominions.  We consider, however, that it would be proper to make the change now. when the number of Indians already holding the full King&apos;s Commission is still small.  Consideration of the new form of commis- sion will involve a large number of technical points;  and we,  therefore, suggest that it should be examined by the Secretary of  State for India, in consultation with the Secretaries of State for  War and Air,  and that their recommendations should be  reported to  the Committee of Imperial Defence.     24.   Recommendation No. 3. The eight-units system should be maintained, and           the number should hereafter be expanded as  necessary.     We fully  agree indeed we consider it essential that the  general principle underlying  the eight-units  system &quot; should be maintained, since we should never recommend  assent to any measure  which involved experimenting with the Indian Army as  a  whole.  In our view this principle affords the only practical means of isolating  the experiment,  and  thus of arriving in course of time  at an accurate estimate of its results.  And it has tho added advantage  that  it  will secure the position of British Officers entering the Indian  Army. It may  thus serve to cure the alarming shortage of British candidates of the  right type, to which we have already referred in paragraph 19.  We would stipulate, however, that any decision as to the expansion of the &quot;eight-units  system&quot; must  be reserved until further experience has been gained.     25.  Recommendation No.  4. Indians  who enter Sandhurst in future should           be posted to Indianising units (a)  in vacancies of  British officers  until          such vacancies are no  longer  available;  (b)  thereafter in place of           Viceroy&apos;s Commissioned officers.     This  recommendation  is a natural corollary to our previous  recommendations, and we agree with it in principle. We consider, that the details can best&apos; be settled by the Secretary of State for India in consultation with the Government ofTndia.&quot;&apos;-&apos;     26.  Recommendation  No.  5. The vacancies for direct  commissions  through          Sandhurst should  be increased  to  20 per  annum;  and five  further          vacancies should be given to  Viceroy&apos;s Commissioned  officers who pass          through. Sandhurst.     We have been informed that Sandhurst  could absorb Indians up to a maximum of 25 per annum without serious risk of prejudicing its essential  characteristics; and that the Army Council would  be prepared to accept up to that  number.  At the same time, the Chief  of the Imperial General Staff told us that  Sandhurst is already carrying a residuum of cadets, which tends to lower the standard of the College as a whole, and that methods of raising the educational standard of British entrants are being  seriously considered.  We are impressed by the force of these arguments; and we consider it essential that  Indian candidates should be  required to pass the same standard  of admission as British candidates, and  should not,  as hitherto, be admitted on a  separate and  lower  standard.   We hold equally strongly that the British standard of proficiency at Sandhurst  should be insisted on for Indians;  and, in any event, it must  be clearly understood  that the Army Council  have the  right with Indian, as with British, cadets to remove without  question  any  cadet who is considered unfitted to become an officer.   In that. connection, we desire  to  draw attention to the disastrous effect that would be created, if  an unduly large proportion of Indians admitted to Sandhurst were removed for inefficiency.  We suggest that the  necessity of obviating  this  risk by the  maintenance of a proper standard of selection, should be impressed on the Government of India.
    27.  Recommendation  No.  6. Eight annual vacancies at Woolwich should be           given  to Indians.  Those who pass out from  Woolwich  should  receive           King&apos;s Commissions,  as  now  granted  to  Indians passing  out from           Sandhurst.    In principle there is no objection to the admission of a limited number of indians to Woolwich, provided that the British standard of admission to, and proficiency at,Woolwich, is rigidly insisted on.   Thus,  an Indian would  only be eligible  for appointment to an Indian Service engineer or artillery unit, if his place  on  thepassing out list would have  qualified him for  the Royal Engineers or Royal Artillery,had he been  a British cadet.   In practice,  however, we consider it indispensablethat a satisfactory scheme for the eventual employment of  Indians who have passedout successfully,  should be settled in advance.   The  Government of India havesuggested that Indian officers who have so passed out should be absorbed into  IndianMountain Batteries and Sapper and Miner Companies  (which  are integral parts ofthe Indian Army),  and that  certain of  these  Units should be  earmarked  forIndianisation, as has been done in the case of the  Cavalry and  Infantry.   Thissuggestion appears to us to rely too  much  upon the belief that  Indians will  not succeed in passing out  of  Woolwich  in any appreciable numbers.   However well founded  this belief  may be,  it  appears essential  that  the  position  should  bewell founded this belief may be, it appears essential that  the position  should be safeguarded, and  that  we  should, in no circumstances,  be confronted  with  thenecessity of posting Indians to British Units.  The Government of India&apos;s proposal,as it stands,  does not contain the necessary  safeguard.   In our opinion, this couldbe supplied by requiring that, if and when the number of promising candidates  forWoolwich should  be found to exceed present  expectations, the number of admissionsshould be regulated strictly in proportion to  the rate at which Indian officers can besafely absorbed into Indian Mountain  Batteries, and Sapper and Miner Companies.We recommend that the Government of  India should be  asked to  submit their estimate of the rate at which Indianisation can safely be allowed to proceed in thoseUnits, and that the number of vacancies at Woolwich should be limited accordingly,as occasion may require.    Indian Mountain Batteries  are at present commanded by British Service officers,who are not in the same position as Indian Army officers, and  could not be ordered to serve in a  Battery that had been earmarked for Indianisation.  It would appearnecessary, therefore, that the Government of India should ask for volunteers fromthe British Service, on terms to  be arranged, to maintain the officer establishment ofsuch Batteries.&apos;    We are. unable, in the time at our  disposal, to commit ourselves in scay way withregard to any particular scheme.  At this stage,  therefore, we  record our  view thatwe see no objection on principle to the admission of Indians to Woolwich, providedthat a suitable scheme can be devised for their eventual employment in Indian Serviceunits.  We understand that, on that condition, the army Council would be preparedto accept Indians at Woolwich  up to a maximum of six a year.  Until, however, adefinite scheme has been agreed  upon, it would be premature to come to any decision as to the number to be admitted annually; and we recommend that any announcement on the subject should be  confined to a statement of the principle that Indians  will beregarded as eligible for  admission to Woolwich as soon  as a satisfactory scheme  fortheir subsequent employment in Indian Service units has been completed.    As regards the form of commission to be granted  to  Indians who pass out of woolwich, our recommendation in paragraph 23 is applicable.    28.  Recommendation  No.  7. Two annual  vacancies at  Cranwell should be           given to Indians.  The form of commission to Indians xvho pass out from           Cramvell should be reserved, for further  consideration.    We consider that there is no objection in principle to the admission of indians to Cranwell, and we have been told that the Air Council would accept them providedthat the  British standard of admission and proficiency is insisted on.   But here again it must first be settled how successful cadets are to be  employed;  and in this instance  the  special  difficulty arises,  that  there  are no Indian Air Force  Unitscorresponding in any way with the Cavalry, Artillery, Engineer and Infantry Unitsof the Indian Army.  The Government of India proposed to overcome this difficulty
 by the adoption of the scheme drawn up by the Air Officer Commanding in India, which is described in the enclosure to their Despatch.  We found ourselves unable to agree to this scheme, since it  contemplates the maintenance  for some  14 years of mixed Air Units, in which British officers and other ranks would, at one stage or another, have to serve under Indian officers.   At our request the Secretary  of State for India asked the  Government of India  by  telegraph  to  amplifv their proposals in such a way as to guarantee suitable employment to Indians who pass out of Cranwell, without the necessity of posting them for an indefinite period  to British Service Units, an arrangement which the Government of India themselves recognise as  impossible.  The Viceroy,  in his reply, has suggested an  alternative scheme, the essence of which is the recognition of the necessity of gradually creating an entirely Indian Air Organisation for the reception of any  Indian officers who succeed in passing out of Cranwell.     We are unable, in the short  time at our disposal, to commit ourselves in any way with regard to this particular scheme, but we are satisfied that  the ground  of our objections to the original proposal has been realised in India, and that it is not impossible to  devise ways and means of meeting them.  At this stage, therefore, we record our view that we see no objection, on principle,  to the admission of Indians to Cranwell, on the conditions we have stated.   The matter should, in our opinion, be further explored by the Secretary of  State for India, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Air and the Government of India.     We are informed that, on the conditions  stated, the  Air  Council would be prepared,  in  due  course,  to   accept  Indian   cadets  at  Cranwell.   Until, however,  a  definite  scheme  can be   worked   out on  the  lines   we  have advocated, we consider it  would  be premature to  come to  any decision as  to the number of Indians to be admitted annually to Cranwell; and we recommend  that any announcement on the subject should be confined to a statement of the principle that  Indians  will be regarded as eligible for admission as soon  as a satisfactory scheme for their subsequent employment in an Indian air unit has been  completed.     29.  Recommendation No. 8. The question of  the establishment of an Indian           Military  College  should  be  postponed  until SandMirst  is  no  longer           capable of absorbing Indian cadets in the numbers forthcoming.     Considerable difficulty has been experienced in  filling even the limited number of vacancies at present offered at Sandhurst:  Up  to  date, out of 243 candidates who have presented themselves  for these vacancies, 97 have been admitted; 25 of these  are still  in  residence,  but of  the remaining 72,  only 51  have  been commissioned.   In view of Indians inability to fill satisfactorily even the  limited number of vacancies  at present offered, we  agree that no good purpose would be served in existing circumstances by the establishment of an Indian Military College.     30.  Recommendation No.  9. An overseas element should  be created in the           existing pay of the Indian Army, and Indians entering Sandhurst under           the new system shoidd be ineligible for this element.     We understand that the principle of differential rates of pay has already been largely acted upon in the Civil Services in India.   The proposal to apply it to the Army, therefore, appears reasonable and proper.    31.  Recommendation  No.  10. Scholarships should be instituted  to enable           Indian boys to meet  the expenses of education at Sandhurst,  Woolwich           and Cranwell.    Field-Marshal Sir Claud Jacob told  us that when he was President of the Selection Board in India,  out of an average of 25 candidates who presented them- selves  each year for  commissions, he had had great difficulty in passing five as suitable.  He also told us that the cost of educating  an Indian youth at Sandhurst was  remarkably  high,  and that the Government  of  India would have  to pay practically the whole  of these expenses if they wished  to attract the best class of fighting man.  We are impressed by this evidence;  and we are, therefore, in full agreement with the proposal to institute scholarships as a means of improving both the quality and  the quantity of  candidates.  Nothing which might widen the field of suitable candidates should  be left undone.[16921]c
     32.  Recommendation No. 11. The official guardian at Sandhurst should be a           serving officer.     We  consider  that the question of the position of the official  guardian  atSandhurst should be settled  by  the  Secretary of State  in consultation  with theGovernment of India.     33.  Recommendation No. 12. Any deficiency  in the forces available for the           defence of India due  to lesser efficiency of completely Indianised units           should be made good either by additional British troops or by additional           Indian troops with British officers.     We are in full agreement with this proposal, which is a necessary corollary tothe experiment of Indianisation.     34.  In  conclusion,  we do not wish either the Cabinet or the Committee ofImperial Defence to be under any illusion as to the effect of the policy under discussion on the efficiency of the Indian Army.  Our expert military advisers made it clear to us that, in their opinion, it would not be safe, at any rate unless and until the experiment proved successful, to rely  either in actual warfare or even for themaintenance of law and order, on units in which the British element  is within sight of disappearing.  Consequently, a portion of the Indian Forces is being deliberatelyexposed to the risk of a progressive deterioration  in  the  standard of efficiency,without any corresponding economy, at a moment when disarmament and  economyare  the order of the day, and when as revealed  by  the  enquiries  of  the  Sub-Committee of the Committee  of  Imperial Defence on the Defence  of India themilitary resources of India require considerable readjustment to enable them to fulfil the possible defensive  needs of the country.  But we are inextricably committed,and  on grounds of policy and expediency we cannot leave matters where they nowstand.  In these circumstances, we consider  that the proposals of the Governmentof India are  probably the most innocuous that  can be devised.  We  do not for onemoment believe that, by adopting them, we shall satisfy Indian aspirations.  But weshall be keeping the ground fully  occupied, and we shall be able to reply with truthfor many years to come that we are doing our best to meet Indian susceptibilities.     35.                  SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.     (1.) We see no objection to an announcement that the  Government&apos;s policy is togive better opportunities for the advancement of Indian Officers in the developmentof a  force within the Indian Army officered by Indians, provided that it is definitelyrequired that the process is strictly contingent on the success achieved in the various stages of the experiment.  The units  in which  the experiment of Indianising is tobe tried should be organised on the model of British Battalions with homogeneousofficer establishment instead of two distinct types of Commissions (paragraph 22).     (2.) The form of commission to be granted in future to Indian  Officers shouldbe analogous in respect of power of command to that granted to officers in the self-governing Dominions.  The details should be further  examined by the Secretaries ofState for War, Air and India, whose recommendations should be reported to theCommittee of Imperial Defence (paragraph 23).     (3.) It is essential  that  the principle underlying the  &quot;eight-units  system&quot;should be maintained.   Any  decision as to its expansion must be  reserved until further experience has been gained (paragraph 24).     (4.) Indians  who enter Sandhurst in future should  be posted  to Indianisingunits (a) in place of British Officers until such vacancies are no longer available; and(b) thereafter, in place of Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers (paragraph 25)     (5.) We  see no objection to an announcement that vacancies at Sandhurst willbe made available to Indians up to a maximum of 25 per annum, provided that theBritish standard of proficiency is  insisted on for Indians at all three stages, viz., forpassing into Sandhurst, for retention at the College, and  for passing out.  Thenecessity of maintaining a proper standard of  selection should be impressed on theGovernment of India (paragraph 26).     (6.) We see no objection in principle to declaring Indians eligible for admission to Woolwich, provided that a suitable  scheme can  be devised  for  their  eventual
employment.   Pending this, we think it premature to record any conclusion as tothe number of vacancies to be reserved annually.   The British  standard should be insisted on in exactly the same way as for Sandhurst (paragraph 27).    (7.) We see no objection in principle to declaring Indians eligible for admission to Cranwell, provided that a suitable scheme can be devised for their eventual employ-ment otherwise than  in British  Service Air Units.  Pending this we  think itpremature to record any conclusion as to the number of vacancies to be reservedannually.   Here  again,   the British  standard  must  be applied  throughout(paragraph 28).    (8.) No good purpose would be served in existing circumstances by the establish-ment of an Indian Military College (paragraph 29).    (9.) The principle of creating an overseas element in the existing pay of theIndian Army,  on  the precedent already  existing in the Indian  civil  services, is ingeneral accordance with the remainder of our conclusions (paragraph 30).    (10.)  The success of the scheme would be furthered by the institution of scholar-ships to enable Indian boys  to meet the expenses of education at Sandhurst, woolwich and Cranwell.  Nothing which might widen the field of suitable candidates, shouldbe left undone  (paragraph 31).     (11.)  The question of the position of the official guardian at Sandhurst shouldbe settled by the Secretary of State for India in consultation with the Government ofIndia (paragraph 32).    (12.)  Any deficiency in the forces available for the defence of India due to lesserefficiency of completely Indianised Units should be made  good either by additionalBritish troops or by additional Indian troops and British officers.

PAPER NO.  130 D].          ******                      (27) Indianisation of the Indian Army.    117. On  tlie 28th  March  1921 the  Indian Legislative  Assembly  passed  the following resolutions :      &quot; (a) That the king-Emperor&apos;s Indian subjects should be freely admitted to all         arms  of His Majesty&apos;s  Military, Naval and  Air Forces  in  India, and  the         Ancillaiy Services and  the Auxiliary Forces.   That every encouragement         should be given to Indians,  iueluding the educated middle-classes, subject         to the prescribed standard of fitness, to enter the commissioned ranks of the         Army  .  .  .     &quot; (b) That not less than 25 per cent, of  the  King&apos;s commissions granted every         year should be given to  His Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects to start with.&quot;    These resolutions were accepted by the Government of India.    118. In para. 40 of their Report, Lord Ra\vlinson&apos;s Committee  recommended that the Indianisation of the Indian Army should proceed by the following method :      &quot;(a) A gradual and prudent reduction of  British  units in the Army in India.     &quot; (6) The  gradual Indianisatiou of the  commissioned  and other appointments         now held  in the Indian Army by British personnel, and the rendering of         India more and more self-supporting  as regards  all arms and services.&quot;    119. Section (24) of this Report,  deals with (a).  As regards (b), Lord Rawliuson&apos;s Committee recommended that 26  per cent, of the vacancies for Indian Army cadetships at  Sandhurst should immediately be thrown  open to Indian youths, and  that that percentage should be increased by 2^ per cent, annually,  so that  in 10 years&apos; time the proportion of  British  and Indians enteiun&quot;&apos;  the commissioned  ranks  of the Indian Army would be equal.  That Committee further recommended that  commissions in the Ancillary Services  with separate Indian cadres, such  as the Supply and Transport Corps and the Indian Ordnance Department, should be thrown open to Indians, and also that Indians should be admitted  to  commissioned  rank in the Indian  Artillery and Indian Sappers and Miners.    120. The Government of India made no specific recommendation in regard to this portion of the Report of Lord Rawlinsou&apos;s Committee.    121. In their Despatch No. 74 of September 1921  the Government of India have asked that:      (1) a limited number of suitable Indian lads may be sent home  for training in         the Royal Air Force, with a view to their obtaining commissions  as officers         in the Royal Air Force for service in India;     (2) a limited number of suitable Indian candidates should be admitted each year         into Woolwich with  a  view to their  obtaining  commissions in such  uuits         as the Indian Pack Artillery, the Sappers and Miners and Military Works         Services;     (3) the number of  cadetships  at  Sandhurst annually for Indians should  be         increased from  10 to 12 or 13, this latter number being 25 per cent, of the         number of commissions granted at present annually to the Indian Army.    122. We have also had before  us a scheme  for Indianisation, the essential feature of which was that  a Dominion Force should gradually be formed  in India.  It was proposed that that Force should be initiated by the formation of one complete  militaryunit, such as a  brigade of all arms, with ancillary services outside  the  establishmentof the Indian Army.  It was proposed  that further units  should be raised as soon asthe success of  the  experiment  was  assured, and that the strength of the ImperialArmy should bo reduced pari passu with the increase of the Dominion Army.       [1()921]                                                          D
   The scheme provided for the officering of the whole Dominion Force by  Indiansholding Dominion commissions, but a few British officers were to be allotted  to unitsof the Dominion Force on formation for the purposes of organisation and training.   123. The Secretary of State for  India referred that  scheme to the Government, ofIndia for their observations.  The Government ol India rejected the scheme on thegrounds that it  would establish a formation  surplus to  the  minimum  military requirements of India  which the country could not  afford, ami tiiat  it would he  unlitfor service  in  the field.  They further  expressed the opinion that  Indian sentimentwould not accept such a scheme as an earnest of our intention to Indianise the Army.   121. The Government of  India accordingly submitted  another scheme, dated the11th January 1922,  prepared by a Committee  of  military officers in  India, which provided for Lite  complete  Indianisation of  the Indian Army (excluding Gurkhas) in three stages of 14 years each commencing from 1925, with the proviso that the second and third periods might be curtailed if the first period proved successful. The mainfeature of the scheme was the complete Indianisation of  one-third of the units of theIndian Army in each period by posting Indian officers at  the  rate of two a  year to each infantry, pioneer and cavalry regiment  in displacement  of one British and oneViceroy&apos;s commissioned Indian officer.  These Indian olficeis, who would hold King&apos;commissions in His Majesty&apos;s  Indian Land Forces, were to be obtained both fromthose Indian officers  now holding Vicoroy&apos;s  commissions and from cadets from a newmilitary college to be opened in India on the lines of Sandhurst.   125. Under the scheme the annual entry of Indian  officers would  be about  110during the first 14 years&apos; period, and 250 during the second period ; while the  totalnumber of officers ultimately required would be 6,864.   No evidence has been  laid before us to lead us to believe anything approachingthat  number of suitable candidates will be forthcoming.  Under the sj&apos;stem initiatedduring  the war  of  granting King&apos;s Commissions to Indian cadets the supply of candidates  is not sufficient to fill the  small  number of vacancies 10  per annum reserved for them.  Nor   have  the selected  Indian candidates shown themselvescapable of  attaining  the   educational  and  other  standards  required   from  Britishcadets,  over whom  they  are given preferential treatment  by being  admitted  toSandhurst on passing a simpler examination.   120. The security of India from dangers without and within depends ultimatelyupon  the efficiency and loyalty  of the Indian Army.  In the past  the  Indian army has proved itself to  be a  highly efficient and trustworthy instrument   for  war.  Itssplendid record is mainly due to the ability and devotion to duty of its British  officers,and to their extraordinary capacity for gaining the respect and affection of their men.We believe that the continued loyalty and efficiency of the Indian Army are, for thepresent, dependent upon the maintenance of  the present  proportion of British  officers.This view  appears to be shared by the Viceroy, wdio, in a telegram.  No.  22, dated the7th January 1922, stated that, so long as the present proportion of British officers andthe existing composition of regiments  are  retained, he had  every confidence in the loyalty of the Tndian Army.   127. The scheme for Indianisation  put forward  by the Government  of India, and referred to in para.  124,  is irreconcilable  with that view.    It  aims  at the  totalelimination of British officers from  the Indian Army.  We are uuable to understandhow  the Government  of India and  their military advisers have been  able to satisfy themselves that so revolutionary a change can prudently be introduced  at the presenttime.  His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot take  such a risk, nor does it appear that itcan  ever be prudent  to announce a programme requiring, even  in the eyes of itssupporters, 30 or 40 years for its execution.  Much might  happen in so long a period to negative or change the conclusions so announced.   128. Nor is the present moment well chosen for the announcement of so great achange.  India is passing through a difficult period of transition.  Public opinion isrestless, and the measure of support upon which Government can count is doubtful.At such a time when the authority of Government is  widely challenged, and seditionis openly preached, special caution is necessary in all  that relates to the armed forces which are the ultimate basis of the authority of the King-Emperor&apos;s Government, andof the safety of life and maintenance of order.
    129. The Indian claim has been that, as promised in Queen Victoria&apos;s Proclamation,there should he no racial discrimination against Indians.  To this claim full assent isgiven;  but that promise  did  not meau, and  must not be  interpreted to mean, thatIndians are to be selected without regard  to their fitness for the posts which they are called upon to fill.   Until  the capacity of India to supply a sufficient number of trained and suitable candidates has been approved, it would be extremely rash to embark on any large experiment or to pledge the future.Conclusions.    130. (a) A start should be made at once so as to give  Indians a fair opportunityof proving that units officered by Indians will  be efficient in  every way.  Accordingly,eight units of Cavalry or Infantry should  be  selected, to be officered by Indians as now suggested by the Government of India.    (6) The proposal of the Government of India that a military college should beestablished in India for the training of Indian  cadets destined for service in the indian army, in view of the admittedly unsatisfactory results of the experiment of admittingIndian cadets to the Royal Military College,  Sandhurst, without  previous  training,is concurred in.

Undertaking  given  by sir alexander Muddiman on 14th March, vide page 2402 of Assembly debates.   2. After discussion in Council on 7th April  last, we decided that a Committee,including Indian  members of the Legislature, should be appointed to  investigate andreport :  (a)  by  what means it  is  possible to improve upon  the present  supplyof Indian candidates for the King&apos;s Commission,  both in regard to number and quality ;  (6) whether it is not desirable and practicable to establish a military  collegein India to train  Indian officers  for the commissioned ranks of the Indian  Army;(c) if the answer to (b) is  in the affirmative,  how soon should the scheme bo initiatedand what steps should be  taken to carry it out ?  (d) whether, if a military college is established in India, it should  supersede  or  be  supplemented by  Sandhurst andWoolwich as  far as the training of Indian officers is  coiicerned.   3. We have decided to appoint Committee because, as staled in our telegram of24th January, we see certain advantage  to  be gained  in having implications of  anLidiau Sandhurst carefully and exhaustively explored.  We think enquiries  of theCommittee, if  properly directed, should have valuable educative effect on  Indianpublic opinion, and we are also  of opinion,  that  full  investigation of  the  important question of military education   aud  training  of Indians  is  necessary  in order  toprovide us with material which will be indispensable in considering any further phase of Army Indianisation.  Further, we have been informed on previous occasions  thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were willing to consider any proposal we might make fortraining Indian officers in India rather than  at Sandhurst.  References to this  subjectwill  be found in  your  telegrams 675,  dated 14th February 1922, 807, dated 22ndFebruary 1922, and also in yotir telegram 828, dated 5th April 191.8.   4. You will observe that  the terms of reference to the Committee are not so  wideas those, recommended  in  the   resolution  adopted  by  Legislative Assembly  on19th February 1925. In  our opinion, the larger question of accelerating the  pace of Indianisation  in  the Array is not one which  could properly be entrusted to the investigation  of a Committee such as we have decided to  appoint.  We may explain,      [16921]                                                        D 2
                                APPENDIX  (C).   CORRESPONDENCE RELATING TO THE  RECENT PROPOSALS  OF THE GOVERNMENT                                    OF INDIA.      Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,                              dated 18th July 1927.   1473 S.   Army Department.   Indian Sandhurst Committee Report.  We havenow completed  our deliberations on main  aspects  of  Report.  Following  are our provisional conclusions. in this connection, that the scope of the first term of reference laid down  is merely ascertainment of the means by which we can obtain competitors of  better quality and in larger numbers for existing vacancies.    5.  We  have now decided  upon composition of the proposed Committee.   It will be presided  over by Lieut.-General  Sir A. Skeen, Chief of  the  General  Stall&quot;.   It will include  the Army Secretary and, in addition to the members of  the  Legislature, two representatives of  the yeoman  class who  make  service in the Army  their profession, both these representatives having sons at Sandhurst at the present moment.    6.  As regards the procedure, we think  it very desirable that at an early stage of the enquiry the Committee should be  invited to select three or four of its  members, who should proceed to England  in order to see  for  themselves not only Sandhurst, Woolwich and other technical military training colleges, but  also every part of  the machinery which goes  to  the  making  of a British Army officer that is to say, they should  visit  certain selected  preparatory schools and  public schools.   Perhaps it might be advantageous for deputation to visit some military training  institutions on the Continent also.  Deputation  would be  accompanied by a  carefully selected military officer.  Matter is of so much  importance thai we have thought  it advisable to  acquaint  you  fully with what we propose to do.   In particular, we wish  to ascertain definitely  whether  you will undertake  to  secure facilities which  the deputation to England would require.    7. Cost of  the proposed  enquiry  will  be reported  to you as soon as possible. Amount has  not  yet  been  exactly  estimated.   It  will  be  considerable,  but not prohibitive.    8. We  request reply by telegraph  as soon as possible.   We have not  yet made any announcement on  the  subject, apart from undertaking given  by Home Member in Legislative  Assembly, and we are anxious to summon the preliminary meeting  of the Committee immediately before the  August session of the Legislative Assembly.     Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Army Department, dated 7th July 1925.    1849.  Army Department.  Your  telegram  of the 16th May,  No. 305.  I have noted with interest  debate in Legislative Assembly on 19th February and  recognise advantage  to be gained as stated in your para.  3 by appointment of  Committee with which you have now decided to proceed.  I agree, moreover, that  institution of such enquiry  is a development  which  His  Majesty&apos;s Government have  already in the past been  prepared to   contemplate.  Difficulties experienced  in   successive  years   in obtaining suitable recruits for Sandhurst, have rendered enquiry under first term  of reference especially desirable, if not, indeed, inevitable ; ami I agree that opportunity can now usefully be ta,ken to examine alternative methods of training tinder second term. As regards latter, please see suggestion made in my telegram dated 19th dune,  No. 1096.    I note your explanation of scope of first term of reference, though it remains to be seen how far Committee can deal effectually with second term without at  the same time approaching wider issues than those you have sought to define.  In view of this possibility and of the bearing which in any event  committee&apos;s  findings must have on existing  system of  recruitment of Indian  officers, I propose  to defer reply to your confidential Army Department Despatch of the 24th  July  1924, No. 33, until I can consider it in conjunction with Committee&apos;s report and your recommendations thereon.   I  wall endeavour to secure  facilities  as requested in your   para. 6  and will communicate  again.  Presumably suggested deputation will not arrive before October,when institutions will be in full working order.   I am telegraphing separately  as regards announcement in reply to your telegramof the 5th June, No. 348.
    2. Although Committee clearly exceeded intention of their terms of reference bylaying clown programme for progressive increase in the number of King&apos;s Commissionsfor  Indians  up to  1952,  and although  their  demands appear to us insufficientlyconsidered and in consequence ill-founded, we welcome the opportunity afforded bythe  Report of formulating definite policy in regard  to  Indianisation.  The existing10 annual vacancies  at Sandhurst were granted during  the war, with  no clear ideahow the officers would be disposed  of.  Similarly, recommendations of our predecessorsin 1921 and 1922 merely aimed at granting so  many commissions to  Indians withoutany reorganisation of units  or formations  iu which they would serve.  The eight-units scheme has  merits  of  clearly defining area of experiment,  but here  againorganisation is the same as that of British officered  units, which we think  unsuitable.Committee  recommend indiscriminate  admission  of Indians, in annually  increasing numbers, into all  units equally with  British oHicers.  It is probable that this would affect adversely  supply of British officers  for the  Indian  Army, which  committee itself considers essential to efficiency.  Moreover, it  is also possible  that  War  office would feel  that such action might even prejudice recruitment to the British service.We should be glad to be informed of considered views of His Majesty&apos;s Governmenton these points, which are obviously of  the  first importance.  In any case we cannotassent to incurring possible loss of efficiency entailed by a measure which involvesexperimenting with  the Indian  Army as  a whole.   But.  the salient objection tothe Committee&apos;s  proposal  is that it  is merely  a time-table, which  depends on  auunascertained supply of entrants  of unproved  quality and  seems to  contemplate no definite goal.    3. We consider that, the time  has  come  to acknowledge and  announce publicly that the ultimate  goal of Indiauisation is  the creation of a self-contained DominionArmy, in which the commissioned officer will hold  a King&apos;s (India) Commission  and units will be organised on  the  model of British battalions with homogeneous officerestablishments instead of two distinct types  of commissions.    4. We are unanimous that announcement of the  main policy should be made assoon as possible.   Some  members were disposed  to press  the  view that,  from  thedate of the announcement of  the policy, new entrants to Sandhurst should be eligiblefor the Dominion type of commission only, with consequential reductions of pay,  andon being commissioned should  replace the Viceroy:s commissioned officers as platoonand troop leaders.   Others of us, including the Commander-in-Ohief, fear that if these changes were to come into operation simultaneously from the date of the announcementof policy and before  the concessional  measures suggested below had taken practical effect, proposals would be condemned as retrograde, candidates would be discouraged by the  diminished  prospects from  offering  themselves  for  commissions, whole scheme would be prejudiced and might even be wrecked at the outset.  It was alsostrongly urged that it would  create a difficult and undesirable  situation betweenIndian and British cadets  serving side by side  at  Sandhurst and going  to join  theIndian Army together if both  realised  that, on  joining the Indian Army, the formerwould receive subordinate commission.   In deference to these views  we recommend that the issue of King&apos;s commissions to Indians trained at Sandhurst should be continued until the nucleus of a Dominionforce can  be created, on the understanding  that the change to a Dominion basis isnot indefinitely postponed and  that, progress in this  direction will be the subject of periodical review.   We recommend that Indians who enter Sandhurst in future shouldbe posted to  Indianising units either in vacancies of British officers or in  those ofViceroy&apos;s commissioned officers as required,  with a view to accelerating the conversionof the units  into British or  Dominion pattern.   5. We contemplate, therefore, that  Indians  receiving King&apos;s commissions shottldin future be posted to the smallest number of units, not less than eight, that is capableof absorbing them, and in practice, therefore,  it  may be taken that our proposals are a continuance of principle of eight-units scheme.   We  consider  that it  mustbe  recognised from  the  beginning  that  completely Indianised  units of cavalry,infantry and pioneers may prove less efficient than  British officered units,  and, if so,that when time comes the resulting deficiency in the forces available for the defenceof India  must be  made  good,  either by additional British troops  or by  additionalIndian troops with British officers.   6. In 1921 the then Government of India accepted a Resolution of the assembly that no less than 25 per cent, of King&apos;s Commissions granted  every year should  begiven to Indians to start  with, and  supported (sic) the proposal  to His Majesty&apos;s
Government, who,  however, were unable  to  approve it.   The Assembly was  so informed  in July  1923.   The  Committee has expressed  strong views  againstcontinuing the restrictions to number of vacancies originally allotted  in 191S on  theground that such narrow numbers afford too scanty inducement  to material to come forward.  We think there is force in this contention, and are also of  opinion that theexisting numbers are insufficient to give initial effect to policy which we ourselves now recommended.   We should accordingly propose  to increase the vacancies  for directcommissions through Sandhurst to 20, and to give five commissions annually, throughSandhurst also,  to  Viceroy&apos;s commissioned  officers  on the lines of commissions now given to rankers in  the British service.  Shortage in the 20 vacancies might be made good  by increasing  the  number of commissions granted to Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers up to a maximum of 10 in any one year.  We  would permit no  lowering of standard  in the entrance  examination.   Further,  we  propose  that  Committee^recommendation  of  eight annual vacancies at  Woolwich and  two  at Cranwell  beaccepted,  On condition stipulated  by  Committee that Indian boys shall be required topass the  same  entrance test as British boys.   Indian entrants to artillery could beattached  to mountain  batteries on  being commissioned, with  a view  to eventualformation of separate  Dominion  artillery units.  The question of  creating Indianartillery,  other than mountain batteries, must  be  reserved for  later consideration.Similarly, engineer officers  would serve with sapper and  miner companies, militaiyengineering services and signal  companies.  Indians  commissioned  from Cranwellwould  be attached  to  units of the  Royal Air Force  in India until  such time as an indian Air Force is instituted  under scheme which has been put forward by the  air officer Commanding.  We reserve for further consideration type of commission to begranted to Indians in Indian Air Force.    7. We are unanimous that, on grounds of  military efficiency and economy,  thequestion of the  establishment of an Indian Military  College  should  be  postponed until Sandhurst is  no longer capable of absorbing Indian cadets  in the numbersforthcoming.  We think that in future as many as possible of the  first officers  of  theDominion Army  should  have received their military education  with British cadets atSandhurst.    We make no  proposal for increasing the number of vacancies at Sandhurst beyond25, since we  anticipate  that it will  be  some years  before we  regularly obtain that number, and until we have  had  experience of  the  result of extending the numbersit would be  useless  to make further  recommendations.  If the  requisite material isfound  to  be forthcoming, we  should contemplate gradual  expansion of numbers wehave given, and  we  should  be  glad to learn in clue course  the maximum number of indians which Army and Air Councils would  be  prepared to  admit  annually toSandhurst, Woolwich and Cranwell in the future.    S. In  view  of  our  inability  to   recommend  immediate institution  of  IndianSandhurst, we realise that many of the best types of  candidates  may be lost to  thearmy through the extra charges imposed on  parents by7 the cost of  sending their sonsto  England.  We propose,  with reference to recommendation (24) in Appendix 1 of report, to institute scholarships  to  enable Indian boys to meet the expenses  ofeducation at Sandhurst, Woolwich or Cranwell.  The  maximum amount  admissiblewould  be  based on the difference between this cost and assumed cost of education atan Indian Military College.   Subject to  this maximum, Commander-in-Chief shouldhave full discretion  to regulate the amount of scholarships according to the  pecuniarycircumstances of individual cadets.    9. As  regards pay,  we  think  that  an overseas  element shotdd be created   in existing pay of Indian Army officers, and that Indians  entering Sandhurst under new system should be ineligible for this element.    10.  We recommend also  that the  official  guardian of Indians at Sandhurst shouldbe a serving officer, who would be very carefully selected.    11.  Resolutions  on the subject of  the Committee&apos;s Report have been tabled in  theAssembly and Council  of State.   A  pledge was given in  the Assembly  last  sessionthat there would &quot;be full opportunity for discussion of the  Report  before the final decisions  were taken.  It. would be convenient for us if, in meeting the resolutions, wecould announce the main features of the scheme which we have outlined in this telegramas  our provisional  conclusions and  invite  the  House to express its  opinion.  Weshould be careful to explain that our  proposals  had not yet  been sanctioned by HisMajesty&apos;s  Government,  with whom  the  final  decision lies.   After debate in theAssembly we would propose to address you  by despatch dealing fully with  the whole
question.   If you  consider  that  disclosure of any  of our proposals,  eveu on  this understanding, might prove  embarrassing to His Majesty&apos;s Government, we would do our best to say&apos; nothing under that particular head.  But it would help us considerably in meeting inevitable criticism to be able to announce the  following:  namely, the reservation  of 25 vacancies annually  at  Sandhurst,  S  at  Woolwich  and  2 atCranwell;  the  grant  of scholarships  and the appointment  of a  specially selectedofficer on the active list as oflicial guardian to Indian  cadets in England.

Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 29th July 1927.   2099.   Army Department.  Your telegram of the 18th July, No. 1473 S.  IndianSandhurst Committee Report.  Jt has not been possible in the time available before the rising of Parliament to obtain the opinion  of  the Committee of  Imperial Defence on your proposals, and I should not be  justified in assuming that War Office and the AirMinistry will not oppose the policy of a self-contained Dominion Army as  the ultimategoal of Indianisatiou.  In these circumstances its  announcement by you, howevemuch guarded  by an explanation that it was provisional and that the final decisiorlay with  His  Majesty&apos;s Government,  could  not  but lead to difficulties.   In  some quarters the announcement would  almost certainly be taken to be  the consideredpolicy of Government and there  would be risk of charges of breach of faith ; and inany case the disclosure of differences between your Government and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on so important a matter would be embarrassing.   I regret, therefore, that I cannot agree  to the announcement of the policy which you propose.   The question remains whether  it  would still be  possible to announce  yourprovisional views on points of detail mentioned in the last paragraph of your telegram.An announcement of  25 vacancies at Sandhurst would be misleading, for it would naturally be taken as implying  the  replacement of  15  more British officers a  yearby Indians, wheieas  your actual intention, as I understand it, was to utilise theadditional 15 Sandhurst cadets  to  replace  officers with  the Viceroy&apos;s  Commission.As regards the Woolwich and  Cranwell  cadetships the indications are  that  WarOffice and Air  Ministry are as  strongly opposed as ever to the  grant of King&apos;commissions, and the announcement you propose, in advance of a Cabinet decision in support of it, would be only less  embarrassing than an announcement on the major question of Army organisation.  An  announcement of the two minor questions that remain would, you will agree, serve no purpose.   I regret, therefore, that I must ask you to make no statement  at  all of your viewson the questions arising out of the Indian Sandhurst Report.   I recognise that this may expose your Government to criticism in the Assembly ; but there  has been no time for adequate consideration by His  Majesty&apos;s Government of the large questions raised by the Report, and the undertaking to the Assembly did  not go  beyond a promise that an  opportunity for  discussion would  be given when the Government ofIndia, after consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government, were in a position to informthe Assembly.

Indians passing out of woolwich should have  precisely same  type of commission as Indians  passing outof Sandhurst, for the reason that  they will  be as much members  of  the Indian army as Indians who come from Sandhurst.
  Despatch  No.  38, from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of  State for  India,                             dated 13th October 1927.                      Indian Sandhurst Committees Report.My Lord,       In  paragraph  11 of our  Army  Department  telegram No. 1473  S., datedthe 18th July, we  stated  our intention of addressing Your  Lordship by despatchon the whole subject of the Indian Sandhurst Committee&apos;s  Report after the debate inthe Simla  session of the  Legislative  Assembly.  A Resolution  was  moved in  theLegislative  Assembly  urging the immediate adoption of the recommendations inthe Report.  The debates  on the Resolution  took  place  on the  25th August andthe 13th September, and there was a debate on a similar  Resolution in the&apos;  Councilof  State on the 31st  August.    We   invite   Your  Lordship&apos;s  attention to  theseproceedings.    2. Lord  Reading&apos;s Government  informed  Your Lordship at  the time  of  theappointment  of  the  Committee that the scope of the first term of reference to theCommittee was merely the  ascertainment of means by which the Government of india could  obtain for existing  vacancies  competitors  of better  quality  and  in larger numbers.   They  observed  that  the larger cpiestion of  accelerating   the  pace ofIndianisation in the Army  was, in  their  opinion, not one  which could  profitably beentrusted  to  the investigation of  the  Committee.   Your Lordship, in your telegramNo. 1S49, dated 7th July 1925, noted this explanation of the  first  term of  reference,but added that  it remained to be seen  how far the Committee would deal effectuallywith the second  term (whether it  is desirable  and practicable to  establish a MilitaryCollege in India) without  at the same  time  approaching wider issues. It must beadmitted that the Committee have addressed  themselves  principally  to acceleratedIndiauisation, and have relegated the question of the improvement of  the  quality of candidates  more or less to the  background.  Their primary recommendation is that asubstantial and progressive  scheme for the Indianisation of the  Indian  Army beadopted without delay.  This scheme  is set forth  in  Appendix II,  and  its  main features are summarised in paragraph 21 of the Report.   Accelerated  Indianisationof the commissioned  ranks of the  Army was  part of  the policy advocated in theLegislative Assembly Resolution which led to the appointment of the  Indian sandhurst committee.   Although it  was deliberately left out of the terms of reference to theCommittee for the reasons given above, the Committee, in  their proceedings, appearto have concentrated  more aud more upon it, and there is  no doubt that the public for a considerable time past have supposed that the object of  the  appointment of  theCommittee was  to consider  further  measures of Indianisation.   Speaking  in theLegislative Assembly  on &apos;the 13th  September  last,  Mr. Jinnah, a member ofthe Committee,  said : &quot;The policy was aud I do not want the House to forget it  to accelerate the Indianisation of the  officer ranks of the Army  in  India.   Thosewere, inter alia, the terms  of  reference to the Committee.&quot;  The argument which theCommittee used to justify their embarking on a wider problem than was specificallyreferred to them Avill be found in  paragraph 20 of  the  Report. It is, briefly, that solong as vacancies available for Indian  candidates are  limited to ten a year  with no prospect of increase, it would be useless to adopt, other measures for the improvementof the supply of  candidates.    3. We did not think it desirable to stress the fact that the recommendations of theCommittee had  gone beyond what the Government of India intended.   Looking backon  the event, it seems to us inevitable that  this should have  happened.  If theCommittee had not amplified the first term of reference, they would have raised thequestion of further urbanisation, as Your Lordship foresaw, on the second.  It wouldhave been idle to propound a  scheme for a military college with an  annual outturn often officers only a point which did  not  escape the Committee  (paragraph  44).The Committee, in a note to paragraph 6 of their Report, quoted the Resolution,accepted by Government in the Legislative Assembly on the 28th March 1921, to theeffect that not less than  25 per cent, of the King&apos;s commissions  granted  every year should be given to His Majesty&apos;s Indian  subjects to start with.  They must also havebeen aware of the fact stated in paragraph 6 of our telegram that the Government ofIndia recommended this proposal to the Secretary of State.  They doubtless felt  thatthey were  justified in putting forward a policy which the Government  of India hadformally adopted in 1921, but had  so  far done nothing to carry out.  Moreover, the language of  the foreword  with which  we published  the Report implied that we
 acquiesced in the course taken by  the  Committee, and that we were prepared to deal with the Report as a scheme for  progressive Indianisation.  Finally, as we informed Your Lordship in paragraph 6 of our telegram of  the  ISth July 1027, an increase of Indianisation is  necessary to the scheme which we ourselves propose.  Accordingly the  commander-in-Chief,  speaking in  the  Legislative  Assembly,  accepted  the conclusion of the Committee on this  point, and  made it clear that the Government intended  to  deal  with  the  Report on  those  lines.  There  was,  and  is  still,  some apprehension, accentuated by the delay in publishing the  Report, by the fact that it was thought  necessary to prefix a loreword to it, and  by the decision not to publish the report of the Sub-Committee which  visited Europe and America, that Government would welcome an excuse to evade, or at any rate postpone, action ou the Report.  If we had lent further colour to  this idea  by  emphasising in the course of the debates that the Committee had exceeded their  terms of reference and ought not to have dealt with accelerated  Indianisation, we should only have excited  greater hostility, at the time, and weakened our subsequent position, when our proposals become public.    4.  Having, however,  recommended  a  policy  of  increased  Indianisation,  the Committee could  not, without palpably  exceeding their  terms  of reference, advise in detail on the  method of carrying it  into effect.  They therefore contented  them- selves with condemning  the  present  eight-unit  system  as an  invidious  form  of segregation, and recommending that  Indian officers should be eligible, as previously, for admission into all units of  cavalry, infantry and pioneers.   We regard this verdict ou the principle of the eight-unit scheme  as unreal.  There  is nothing invidious in a policy of  Indianisation  by units.  The Indian officers who are posted to the units in question are serving, aud will serve for many years to come, with British officers, meeting as equals  in the mess  and in their sports mid games, aud, as was stated both by British and India U King&apos;s commissioned officers in their evidence before the Committee, living together ou 1 he- friendliest terms.  To call such a state of affairs segregation seems to us  absurd ; and we have formed  the  impression that those Indian officers who  used such expressions  in  their  evidence  before  the  Committee were  not  altogether unprompted.  One of them,  for instance,  mentioned that he had taken the  word &quot; segregation &quot; from a newspaper.  &quot;We should  have expected young  Indian officers to welcome a scheme that entrusts to  them whole battalions to make their own, while assuring them of  the control  and guidance of British officers until they reach the seniority requisite for command.  The real objection to the  eight-unit scheme in its present form is not that it is invidious in character,  but that it is too narrow in scope.    On the other  hand,  the proposal to  draft young Indian officers together  with British officers into all units would  not  only dissipate  the experiment over the whole army, but also indefinitely postpone its results.   If  the Committee^ recommendations were accepted and candidates  were forthcoming  in  the numbers laid down by them, it would follow that by  1952 half the officers of the Indian  Army would be Indians serving with approximately equal numbers of British officers in each unit.   Battalions would  be  neither  British-officered nor Indianised ;  and the  Government of  India of that tixiie would  be little, if  at all, nearer than we are now  to answering the question whether Indian officers can undertake without aid the leadership  and command of large bodies  of troops.   If, however,  we retain the system of the  eight units, those units should be officered entirely by Indians some years before 1952.   5. While  we therefore  accept  the Committee&apos;s recommendation for increasing the number of King&apos;s commissions to be  granted  to Indians, we consider  it essential to frame  a policy which will  both  define the goal  of Indianisation to be ultimately reached, and  provide in detail the method of reaching it.   Our aim, if we can obtain sufficient officer material, is the eventual creation of a &quot;Dominion&quot;  army, that is, an army manned and  officered throughout by Indians, and comprising all  arms in whichIndians desire to serve and to bear commissioned  rank.  It  is through the creation of such a force that India can fulfil  her aspirations and  ultimately undertake the responsibility for  any part of her own  defence  by land.  We do not attempt to forecast at this stage to  what extent the &quot;Dominion&quot; army will in  time replaceeither  British troops or British.officered Indian  troops.  We feel, however, that anyfurther expansion of  Indianisation  in the  Indian  Army should follow the  general principle of the eight-units scheme, i.e. that Indian officers must be trained by, and in association with, British officers in units set aside for the purpose, with the object of assuming in due course the command  of such  units, and thereafter, if the experimentsucceeds, rising to higher command  in Iudianised forces.       [16921]                                                           E
   6. We have recommended increasing the vacancies for direct commissions throughSandhurst to 20 as proposed  by the Committee, and giving five commissions annually,through  Sandhurst also, to young officers  holding this  viceroy V Commission.  We donot suggest any programme for increasing these numbers until we have full experienceof the results of the initial step.   As stated in para. 3 of our telegram of the ISth July,we propose that the officer  establishment of Indianised units  should eventually be assimilated to  that of  British  battalions, and  that  Yiceroy&apos;s commissioned officers should  gradually disappear  from them.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  we  wereinfluenced  by several considerations.   In the first place, where Indian troops areto be officered by Indians there should be no need for a link between officers and mensuch as  is provided by the  existing class of  Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers;  andit is clearly desirable that an  Indian officer in an Indian regiment, like the british officer  in a British  regiment, should learn his work in that  close association withthe men which is  involved  by the leadership of  a  troop or platoon.   Secondly, aconsiderable proportion of the candidates for  the King&apos;s commission  will always besupplied by what are for convenience called  the  &quot;martial&quot;  races, from whom theexisting  personnel  of  the Indian Army  are  drawn.   The  Committee, it is  true,recommend that, in selecting candidates for commissions, preference for soldiers&apos; sonsshould in future become the exception rather than the rule; and they quote a high authority in the  present Governor of  the Punjab  to the  effect  that  this preference should not be made a fixed item in the policy of selection.  We anticipate, however,that whether a  preference for families with military connections  be shown in selectionor not, as a matter of fact the  bulk of the candidates will still come from  these&quot; martial&quot;  classes.   Sir Malcolm  Hailey  himself said no more than that  he would always  be prepared to admit a proportion of  men from the  professionai  classes,provided that  candidates came forward with  the  necessary qualifications,  and  withthe appearance of  having the temperament necessary  to make good officers.   we need not emphasise  the  futility  of perpetuating superior and  subordinate types of commission, where  both types  are  held  by  officers  of the same classes  and  evenfamilies.  On the other hand, there are indications of uneasiness among the classesto which we have  referred,  and to which the majority of  Viceroy^ commissioned officers belong, at the prospect of  a large influx of Inuiau King&apos;s commissioned officers with no military traditions ;uid no previous connection with the army.   The relationsbetween  officers  of  this kind and the old-fashioned  Yiceroy&apos;s commissioned officerwithin units are likely to be difficult ; friction and consequent inefficiency may ensue.Whichever class of King&apos;s  commissioned  officer  prevails,  therefore, the  Viceroy&apos;scommissioned officer should be eliminated from a completely Indianised force.   7. We found some difficulty in deciding on the most suitable time for bringing theofficer  establishments of  Indianising \inits into conformity7 with the British pattern.There  are  two possible courses.   The first,  to which some of us  were  inclined,is to continue  posting Indian  officers  in  replacement  of  British  officers alone,until  such time as  the  number of Indian  cadets  approaches the  maximum thatSandhurst  could accommodate.   The reconstruction of officer estabfishments on theBritish pattern  would  then  follow naturally  upon  the establishment of a militarycollege in  India.  In order to absorb the increased entry of Indian officers, it wouldbe necessary to  begin  adding to  the  number of  Indianising units  earlier than itwould  be if  the British pattern were adopted at once.  This would be done byear-marking for Indianisation, as  occasion required, battalions in regiments  or groupsthat did  not already contain  an Indianising battalion.   The great advantage of thiscourse is that  it involves a minimum of dislocation.   The eight units  would  be expanded, within strictly defined limits, exactly in  proportion as more Indian officersbecame available.  At  the same time,  the sentimental demand that  the status and functions of the Indian officer should be in all respects similar to those of the british officer  in the  Indian Army would remain satisfied until  the moment when a  more practical aspiration, namely, an Indian Military College, had  become  a reality.  Themain objection to the plan is that it  would multiply the number of  Indian officers with the ordinary King&apos;s Commission indefinitely,  since we cannot foretell  when thefull  quota  that Sandhurst can accommodate will be exceeded ;  and so  long as Indiansjoin the Army with  the  same status as British officers it would be difficidt, for thereasons  given  in para.  4 of our telegram, to confer on them a different form  of commission.   Those of us who favoured postponement of the reconstruction of officerestablishments were, however, agreed that this  change should  be  announced, as a development to take place later, at the  same time  as the  other decisions on the
Committee&apos;s  Report.  After much  delibei-ation, we concluded  that  the longer wepostponed  the actual change,  the  greater  would  be its  difficulty,  and  that  thereconstruction should begin as  soon as  the opening of the 25 vacancies produces a supply of Indian officers ready for posting  to Indian Army units, over and above what is necessary to  replace British officers in the eight units.   This  will  not takeplace before  October  1931 at the earliest.  Our final  recommendation is, therefore,to appoint Indians to specified units, in the manner described in paras. 4 and 5 of our telegram, until a  continuous supply of  good material is available in greater numbersthan Sandhurst can take.  At that  point the Government of India would  be facedwith the obligation to establish  a  military college in India.  In  the  meantime,  weshould contemplate continuing to post  Indians to specified units in place of british officers, so long as such vacancies  can be made available.   There is,  of course, no intention of appointing Indians to be Squadron or Company Commanders until theyhave the requisite seniority.  If and when such vacancies are no longer available, weshould propose to post Indians to  the uuits in vacancies created by the transfer ofViceroy&apos;s commissioned officers.  . 8. A scheme by which Indian king&apos;s commissioned officers are merely substitutedfor Yiceroy&apos;s  commissioned officers  appears at first sight to constitute no advance  inIndiauisation, but rather to deprive  Indians to some extent of the opportunities whichthey already  possess, and our proposals will almost certainly be  criticised in this sense.  The argument is, however, theoretical and political rather than  practical, and ought not, in our opinion, to  deter  candidates who  have  a  military career  at heart.To the cadet himself it makes no difference in his prospects  of promotion whether hebegins his career as a platoon leader  or a company officer.  In either  case he willhe promoted to the command of a companjr at the same stage in his service, i.e. after about 16 or  17 years.   To meet political criticism it  can be pointed  out that whilethe proposal admittedly  does not  add to the total  number of  Indians holdingcommissions of one type or the other iu  the Indian Army, it more  than doubles  thenumber of Kings Commissions available to Indians.   We  have  carefully considered whether  the closing of Viceroy&apos;s commissions  inIndianising units will have a  harmful  effect  on recruitment.  We  think  this most unlikely.  The rauk aud file will still  be eligible for Viceroy&apos;s commissions in other,non-lndianising, units of the same regiment or group, while our proposals for grantingKing&apos;s Commissions to selected Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers will greatly improve the prospects of this class of officer as a whole.   9. We have recommended that, for  the present, Indian officers recruited underthe new conditions should continue  to receive the same type  of commission as  british officers, aud the same rates of pay, less  an overseas element which will not be grantedto Indians who enter Sandhurst after the inauguration of our proposals.   We havenot yet elaborated details under either of  these  heads.   We are unanimously  ofopinion, however, that  the type of commission should  be a King&apos;s Commission,limited, like the King&apos;s  Commission in  the Royal Indian Marine and in the proposed new  Indian Navy, to the force in which it is granted.   10. We now turn to  the question of the  admission of Indians to Woolwich andCranwell for  service  in  the Artillery,  Engineers and  Air Force.   We have already informed Your Lordship that we recommend  acceptance of  the Committee&apos;s proposal that  eight vacancies should be available annually at Woolwich and two at Orauwellto Indians, on the condition that Indian candidates should be  required to pass  thesame entrance  tests as British boys.   The Committee have not made  it clear how they intend that Indians graduating from these colleges should be employed on their return to India.   It might be inferred from para. 22 of the  Report that they meantsuch officers  to be employed iu British service units,  an  arrangement which  we recognise to be impossible.  We have, however, in  the Indian Mountain Batteries an organisation into  which  Indian officers passing out of Woolwich can be absorbed.   Ifthey are forthcoming, it will probably be necessary to set apart a battery, and later on batteries, for Indianisation,&apos;iu the same way as units of the cavalry and infantry.We wish to emphasise that Indian Mountain Batteries are integral parts of the  indian army, and that Indian King&apos;s commissioned officers  in these batteries  must be giventhe  same status in  all respects  as  Indian  King&apos;s commissioned  officers fromSandhurst.  The  same considerations apply to Indians  who  pass out of Woolwich  asEngineer officers, and are  employed in  Sapper and Miner  battalions.   Here  also itwill  probably be necessary to earmark certain units  for Indiauisatiou.   A further      [16921]                                                         JE 2
and useful opportunity for the employment of Indian Engineer officers will be offered by the Military Engineering Services.  We endorse the Committee^ recommendation that Indians should be eligible to serve in India in the Signal Corps, in which againit would probably he found expedient to establish a separate Indianising unit as soonas a sufficient number of Indian King&apos;s commissioned officers becomes available.   Asregards Cranwell and the employment of Indians in an Air Force, we have little to add to a memorandum  on this  subject by Air Vice-Marshal  Sir W.  G. II. Salmond,Commanding Royal Air Uoi^ce in India, a copy of which we enclose.   The creation ofan Indian Air Force will necessitate some legislation, there being at present no IndianAir Force Act.  This matter  does  not,  however, require  instant decision, as sometime will elapse before  any Indian  cadet may be expected  to  pass out of Cranwell.For the same reason the exact form of commission to  be granted to Indian Air force officers may be left for later consideration as recommended in our telegram  No. 1762 S,dated the  2Sth August 1027.  We trust  that  your Lordship will impress upon  theArmy  and  Air Councils the importance of rendering Indian  cadets  eligible  for admission to Woolwich and  Cranwell to  the limited extent  proposed. Although wedo not anticij)ate a large number of candidates  for these vacancies, the mere fact of opening the two colleges to Indians will gratify Indian  public opinion and remove along-standing grievance.   11. The Committee  have not touched upon the employment of Indian officers in ancillary units and departments such as the Indian Army Service Corps, Indian ArmyOrdnance Corps,  Army Remount Department, Military Farms  Department, &amp;c, orin the Cantonments  Department, the Survey   of India,  the Foreign and  PoliticalDepartment, and other civil departments into which Indian Army officers are permitted to transfer.   We consider that Indians should be eligible, if qualified,  to serve  in  anyof these  departments.   There are,  as   your  Lordship  is   aware,  Indian  King&apos;scommissioned officers already serving in the Foreign and Political Department.   12. The Committee  have  severely criticised  the present methods  of selection ofIndian candidates for Sandhurst in para. 14 of the Report.  While we are not convincedthat the  various  official stages to which the  Committee  refer have the  effect ofdeterring suitable candidates,  we  are  prepared  to adopt the  recommendationsnumbered (x) aud (xi) in Appendix I of the Report,, in  so far as they are applicableto candidates  for  Sandhurst.   We do not think that the  local  advisory  committeessuggested  in  recommendation  (xiii)  would  serve a  useful  purpose.   their recommendations would have no authoritj7, and  as soon as they found, as they  might,that their views  were  disregarded by candidates or  over-ruled  by the selectingauthority, they would cease to function with  enthusiasm or efficiency.  Indeed, it isdifficult to see what inducement could be offered to non-officials  to  serve  on such committees at all.   In practice, the submission of applications direct  to a centralauthority will probably  not eliminate  the local officials through whom applicationsnrast now be sent.  The central authority will in most  cases  require the opinion ofthese local officials as well as that of the authorities of the school or college in whichthe candidate was educated.   We  are, however, in agreement with  the  Committeethat District  Officers and Commissioners shoidd  not retain  the  power  to reject a candidate^ application themselves.   We have no objection to the  minor  recommendation of the Committee in para. 27of the Report, that a non-official Indian gentleman  nominated by the  Viceroy should sit on the Board that conducts the interview test.   13. We entirely concur with the Committee&apos;s observations  in paras. 11 and 24 ofthe Report on the  defects of the educational system in India, and the necessity for animprovement before a steady  flow of first-class candidates can  be expected.  The  loweducational standard of candidates who at  present  offer themselves for Sandhurst iswell known and has become a source of growing anxiety.   We are doubtful Avhetherthe recommendation  of the  Sub-Committee  quoted in para.  24,  namely, that  theimportance  of the matter should  be  brought to  the notice  of the  educationalauthorities and  their co-operation  enlisted,  will in  itself  have very much  effect.Reform in this  respect  can  only be achieved  by public opinion and effort.   Thequality  of candidates for the  existing  vacancies shows   at present no signs  of improving, and the selection authorities are  confronted with  the  dilemma of eithereaving vacancies unfilled or of sending to  Sandhurst, boys who have but little chanceof passing out, and so enhancing the  already high percentage of failure  referred toIn para. 9 of  the  Report.   We hope that the measures adopted as the result of  the
Coramitteo&apos;s recommendations will improve the situation, and we think that there isforce in the contention  that  the  present  supply is adversely restricted by the small number of vacancies offered.   At the same time we are not sanguine that the  wholeof the vacancies which we  propose to declare can be regularly  filled  from now onwards by candidates with  a reasonable  prospect of passing out of Sandhurst.  Itis, however, possible that, the  methods of publicity proposed in para. 26 of the report may help to discover good material, and we intend to follow  the recommendations inthat paragraph.    14. The Committee mentioned the  expense of Sandhurst as one  of  the  factors which deters suitable  candidates from  coming forward.  We agree with their viewthat the expenditure involved  is beyond the capacity of the average  India U parentbelonging to the middle classes.   We have proposed as a  remedy, in  para. S of our telegram of the 18th July 1927, the institution of Government grants proportionate tothe  pecuniary needs of individual cadets, to enable them  to meet the expenses ofeducation  at Sandhurst, Woolwich or  Cranwell.   This  will l-elieve  young indian officers who pass out of Sandhurst of  a  heavy financial handicap  at the  outset oftheir service, and  those  who fail  of  a  dead loss which  further embitters theirdisappointment.  It  will  incidentally  counteract the  only  valid argument againstcreating an overseas element  in  the pay of military officers  aud treating Indians inthis respect in the same way as Indians  in the Civil Services.    15. We  concur  generally in the recommendations made by the  Committee in para. 34 of the Report for  the improvement of  the system of guardianship.  Wherethe cadet or his  parents are in a position to select a personal friend as guardian, we agree that such  a  person  should be appointed, but subject to  the approval of theSecretary of State.   We agree also that the official  guardian appointed to look aftersuch cadets as are  unable  to find a  personal guardian should be  selected with theutmost care.   He shoidd in our opinion  be more directly amenable  to  control than are tired officer can be, aud for this reason we have proposed  that the post should be filled by an officer on the active list.   In framing this recommendation we haveignored the personal strictures of the Sub-Committee which visited  Sandhurst on thepresent official  guardian.   Those strictures were obviously biassed, aud  in any case we are concerned, not with individuals, but with the system.    16. We think that the  above measures should remove whatever obstacles atpresent exist to prevent Indian  youths of  the right stamp and  inclinations  from entering xipon a military career.   As we have explained in para. 7 of  our  telegram,we do not wish  to set tip  an  Indian military college  so  long as Sandhurst canaccommodate  the annual  entry  of Indian cadets.   The Committee  emphasise theimportance of placing  the machinery of  the Indian Military College on  the highestplane of efficiency which India can attain.   We do not consider that  such  a college,if inaugurated  now, or as  early  as 1933, the year proposed by the Committee, wouldbe  comparable with Sandhurst as a producer  of efficient  Indian  officers, howevergreat the pains that -were bestowed upon it.  We do not wish to  see such a collegeestablished before  there is reasonable  prospect of its being an institution of thehighest class.   This will not, occur until Indian officers of proved capacit)&apos;. themselvesgraduates of Sandhurst, are available to take part, with British officers,  in the conductof the Indian college; nor before candidates of the requisite stamp are available in larger numbers than can be accepted by Sandhurst itself.    17. We are in sympathy with the remarks in para.  29 of the Committee&apos;s report about the grant of University Commissions and  the  inability of  Indians at present toenter the Officers&apos; Training Corps at Universities.  We have represented  this matter on  several occasions,  and we are  aware  that your Lordship  has supported  our representations to  the  authorities concerned.   We hope  that  the university  andmilitary authorities  in England may in time be  induced to reconsider their  decision,and to allow Indian students to become members of the Officers&apos; Training Corps.    IS. We trust that His Majesty&apos;s Government will give early  and sympathetic consideration to  our  proposals.  The problem^is one  of great complexity and has remained too long unsolved.   We have  endeavoured to  avoid the error  of  submitting proposals for increased Indianisation without fully  estimating the implications ofsuch proposals.   Our aim  is  to  design a structure, based on clear  principles, whichwill successfully function when complete, and involve a minimum of risk  while it isbeing built up.   As we observed in our telegram, if Indianisation means a loss of
 efficiency, that  loss  must he made  good in  other ways.   Our Army at its present strength barely suffices for  the external and internal  defences of the country.  The outlook on our frontiers  is  not without anxiety; in India the communal situation has probably  never  been  more  strained.   We have received  from  almost  every Local Government a demand for an increase of troops for internal security purposes.  The Indianisation  of the  officer  ranks of the Indian Army  manifestly  involves  a great experiment and a great change.  We cannot afford  to make that experiment with the Indian Army as a  whole.   By providing for the gradual  evolution  of a distinctive Indian-officered force comprising all  arms we hope not only to  initiate progress upon the right lines, but also to appeal to the  patriotism of Indians of the educated classes, and evoke in  them  a  more widespread and genuine desire  to bear arms in defence of their country than can be said to exist at present.                                                  We have, &amp;c,                                                         (Signed)      W.  R. BIRDWOOD, Letter from Secretary to Government of India to India Office, dated 10th October 1927. Sir,       I  am directed  to state, for the information of the  Secretary of  State  for India in Council, that His Excellency7 the Viceroy approved  the Army Department  Despatch No. ,&quot;5S,  dated  the 13th  October, before leaving Simla on  tour on the 10th  October, but the despatch could  not be completed for signature  by that date.   His Excellency desired this to be conveyed to the India Office, to explain  the absence of  his signaturefrom the Despatch.                                                                      I have,  &amp;c,                                                                           G. M. YOUNG.                                 ENCLOSURE TO DESPATCH.      Memorandum by the Air Officer Commanding Royal Air Force in India on the Report                             of the Indian Sandhurst Committee.  1.  I  wish  to  record the fact  that, during thewhole of the proceedings of the Indian sandhurst committee,  no  evidence, as far&apos; as I know,  was called for from the R.A.F. in India.   This appearsto he extremely difficult to understand when theReport contains definite recommendations affectingthis Service.   2. Terms  of reference. The terms of reference of the Committee were  framed with a view toenquiring  into the further  Indianisation  of theIndian Army.  The substitution of British Officershy Indians in Units outside the Indian Army suchas the British Army  in India,  was cleai-ly not-within the terms  of reference.   The  R.A.F. inIndia is on the same footing as the  British Armyin India, consequently  the terms of reference didnot include  the consideration  of Indian  Officersbeing trained to substitute  British Officers in theR.A.F. in  India.  On the other hand, in the  firstterm of reference, it may be held than the Committeewas entitled to consider the question of the supplyof Indian candidates for the King&apos;s Commission ina unit yet to  be formed such  as an Indian AirForce Squadron.  Assuming that this was the intention, the recom-mendation contained in para.  22 of the  report has to be considered.   This  recommendation statesthat  &quot; tho  refusal of  commissions  in the  R.A.F.is, in  our opinion,  singularly  indefonsible,&quot; &amp;c.This means either (a) that Indians should be com-missioned  in the R.A.F. in  India, or  (fc) that theyshould bo  commissioned in order that  ultimatelythey should form part of an Indian Air Force unit in India.  With regard  to (a).  As  already stated, thisproposal is,  in my opinion, oxitside  the terms ofreference,  The R.A.F.  in  India are on the same footing as the British Army in  India; if Indianswere commissioned in  tho  R.A.F. in India, theywould be liable to serve in  tho Royal Air Force inall parts of  tho world where units of this  service were  stationed.  It  would  be  impracticable  to guarantee that they would always remain as officersof R.A.F. units in India; to do so would be creating a precedent never before established. This principle without question would be unacceptable to the air council.  As regards-(6).  This solution involves  a policywhich  has, hitherto, not been considered.  It isdesirable, however, owing to the general  trend ofIndianisation,  that  the  question  of the ultimateformation  of  an Indian Air  Service should be explored.  In  this  connection  it should  be notedthat no general  desire  to  fly has been shown by the three hundred  million inhabitants of India.Compare this  state of affairs to that in Englandwhen  flying became possible in  1907.  Not  onlydid young men rush  to  be trained at the variousschools, but they went  so  far as to do so underassumed names in order that their parents shouldbe kept in ignorance of what they were doing;moreover, they did this  at their own expense and before any sei-vice outlet for flying had been decided\upon.   In  England, therefore,  the background  ofthe desire to  fly existed from the outset.  This,certainly, has not been the case in India.  Duringthe Great  War, it is believed four Indians offeredthemselves and wei&apos;e trained for service  with theR.A.F., of which one distinguished himself andone was killed in action.   It may be contended thatthis reluctance to  fly was  due  to the  fact that facilities for flying did not exist in  India.  Howevertrue this may be, the facilities for flying  are now about to be afforded in consequence of the formationof light aeroplane clubs in India under tho  Directorof Civil Aviation.  When Indians, as  a  result  ofthe formation  of these clubs, show that they havea desire and  capacity to fly, then, in  my  opinion,it will bo time  to  proceed with the training  ofIndian cadets  at Cranwell.   Such a  procedure would  have   the  added advantage that, beforeIndians were sent to undergo an exponsivo  training
in  England,  tho possibility  of  their  failing  atCranwell  would be,  to a  Inrgc  extent, lessened.This  procedure should  be  welcome  by  Indianparents as  not  only  safeguarding their  financial interests but also preventing subsequent misunder-stnnding and disappointment.  3. The system recommended for the developmentof an Indian Air Force is as follows :   Cadets should bo selected from those qualifyingat any one  of  the  following educational establish-ments :       (a)  Delira Dun,      (b)  A British Public School,      (c) An approved Indian Public School,if and when established.  They should be requiredto pass the samo  examination as  British  cadetsbefore entering Cranwell.  The examination shouldbe competitive.   Successful candidates should  thenqualify for their &quot; A &quot; certificate at one of the lightaeroplane clubs in  India.   The standard of dyingrequired to obtain this certificate is of an elementarynature and would, in  the normal course, require nolonger than four to six months&apos;  tuition.  In  theevent of failure, the next on the competitive list asa result of the examination should be selected, andso on.  The cadets  finally  selected  would  then proceed to Cranwell.   After graduating at Cranwell,they  would be gazetted  to a  Commission in  theIndian Air Force and return  to India, where theywould be attached  to Regular  Royal  Air Force squadrons, pending the  formation of a unit of  theIndian Air Force.  4. The type  of commission  and the status it willconfer in  relation to a  King&apos;s  Commission  orViceroy&apos;s  Commission is a matter for subsequentdecision.  It is understood that a similar questionis under consideration by Army Headquarters, andit seems probable that, whatever solution is reachedregarding commissioned officers in the  Indiauisedunits in  the Army, the  same will be suitable for officers of the Indian Air Force.  It is clear that Indian officers of the Indian Armyand Indian Air Force should have equivalent status.  5. It  is considered essential  that,  as  regardsestablishment and  organisation, the  squadrons  ofthe Indian  Air  Force should conform,  as closely as possible, to  units of the British Air Force, thusconforming with the policy which  has been followed in the case of the Dominion Air Forces in Canada.South Africa and Australia.  These squadrons comprise  12 aircraft and a totalof 21   officers   (excluding  one  Medical  Oflicer)and are organised in three sub-formations termedFlights, each consisting of three machines with aFlight Commander and three pilots.   The squadronis commanded by a Squadron Leader (the equivalent in Army  Rank  is Major).   Among  these officers,certain are required to possess specialist qualificationsto perform the duties of Armament Officer, SignalOflicer  and Photographic  Officer.   Tho  trainingrequired  to  qualify officers  for these  functionscannot  be carried out by units  of the  Royal AirForce in  India.  But  there  are  special schools of instruction in England dealing with each of  these subjects, and selected Indian cadets, aftor qualifyingat Cranwell, will  have to undertake the course at these schools before returning to India.  6.  The  squadrons  of the  Royal Air  Force areclassified  according  to the functions  they perform,c.g.  Army Co-operation,  Fighting,  Bombing, &amp;c.After consideration,  it  is  thought that the  typemost suitable to the  requirements of  an Indian AirForce is  the Army Co-operation Squadron ;  theestablishment and organisation  quoted  above arethose appertaining to this type.  7.  The development suggested  for the raising ofau Indian Air Force  Squadron is  as follows: Stage I. Squadron   Leader,  Royal Air  Force             (Commanding Officer).        (a) Squadron H.Q.,  partly R.A.F., partly               Indian.         (b)  One Flight,  Royal Air Force.         (c) One Flight Indian, with  R.A.F. Flight               Commander.Stage II. (a) and (6) as in Stage I.         (c) Two  Flights   Indian,  with  R.A.F.               Flight Commanders.Stage III. (a) and  (b) as in Stage I.        Three  Indian  Flights with  three Indian           Flight Commanders.Stvge 1Y. Squadron as Indian unit  complete, all             British personnel withdrawn.  8.  The  intake of  officers  at  Cranwell proposedby the  Skegn  Report  is two per  annum.    Thefollowing  (..:ble  shows  the period required to  formsuch a  squadron  by stages, assuming entries toCrauwell  at  the  rate  of 2 and  3 per  annumrespectively.Annual Intake.	Period at Cranwell.	Stngo I. Tears to 1 Stage II. completo J Years to nftor 1 complete. Cranwell. ! 1		Stage III. Years to complote.	Stago IV. Years to complete.	Total Years.

[JVote. The figure for  wastago (7) is possibly high, buta margin is  nocossary to allow  for failures at  Cranwell,resignation and casualtios; any credit balance under  this heading will bo an assot.]  Stages III and IV are the important stages, since in Stage III Indian Flight Commanders aro appointed and in Stage IV the command of the squadron willbo taken over by an Indian.  On an entry of two cadets  per annum, pilots willhave had nine years&apos;  service by the time Stage IIIis reached ;  this period of training should be suffi-cient  to produce the  required  number of  officers with  the necessary experience  to enable them toassume command of a Flight.  On an entry of three cadets per annum, they will only&apos; have had six years&apos; service.  As regards Stage IV, on an entry of three, pilotswill have had :     (a)  14 years&apos; service.     (b)  5 years as Flight Commander.
   On an entry of three, pilots will have had :      (a) 10 years&apos; service.     (6) -1 years as Flight Commander.   It  is considered  that  1-t years&apos; service is theminimum  period  of service au officer should  have before he is promoted  to  Squadron Leader.   (Theaverage is  17/1S years in the  case of the british air Force.)  Consequently an annual entry of two to Cranwell appears to be  correct.   9.  Other  Ranks Technical  Instruction. It  liasnot been found  possible even in England with itslarge supply  of technical  labour to recruit artisanspossessing the necessary technical ability to justify their direct entry to the U.A.F. units.   It  lias  been  found necessary to  set up  special training  establishments   where recruits  undergo a course of training from one to three years accordingto  the  different trades  concerned.   In India  nosuch  specialised training organisation exists.  Avery high standard of technical training is essential,and  it would  be, therefore, useless to minimise thedifficulty  of supplying that standard of technical efficiency in an Indian squadron without which itcannot function.   However,  it is satisfactory to note that, at theR.A.F.  Depdt,  Karachi,  certain Indian technical personnel have attained the necessary standard incertain trades, and it is therefore proposed to en-deavour to  utilise this unit for the training of thetechnical personnel required.   It  is  suggested that, as soon as the first entriesof cadets proceed  to  Cranwell, the  complementof personnel  to complete  the first stage, including an  allowance for  wastage, should be enlisted andattached to the R.A.F.  Depot, India, for instruc-tion.  This  would give them  five years&apos; training before the first Flight was formed.   Further stages^vouhl be treated  in the  same way.   An instruc-tional staff of British  personnel in proportion tothe numbers of Indians under  training would haveto be  added to the Depot for this purpose.   10. Finally, I would emphasise  the fact  thatthe eight squadrons now sanctioned for the RoyalAir Force in this country is a bare minimum.   an indian  Air  Force  Squadron  cannot,  for  manyyears, attain  the  efficiency of a squadron of theRoyal Force  and, therefore,  such an  increase  in air strength in this conntry can only be looked upon as additional to,  and  not in  substitution of,  theRoyal Air Force in India.  11.  Summarised,   my  observations  are  asfollows:    (i)  The  inclusion of Indian Officers and airmen      in British  units of the Royal Air Force is      impracticable.   (ii)  If scope is to  be provided  for Indians to      enter  the field of military aviation, this can      best be accomplished by creating an Indian      Air Unit with a cadre of  British  personnel      to train and develop the unit: as the Indian      officers  and  airmen gain   tho  necessary      experience, the  British personnel should bo      gradually withdrawn until tho unit becomes      entirely  Indian.  (iii)  The  unit  should be an Army Co-operation      squadron.  (iv)  Cadets should be drawn from :          Dehra Dun.         An English Public School.         An approved Indian Public School.   (v)  The  entry  to Cranwell should be  limited      to two per annum and should be the result      of a competitive examination similar to that      in force  for the entry of British cadets into      Cranwell.   Before proceeding to Cranwell,      cadets will  be required  to pass  their &quot; A&quot;      certificate  at an  approved  light aeroplane      club in India,  (vi) On passing out  of  Cranwell, cadets should      be commissioned and should  be attached to      Royal Air  Force squadrons  in units for a      period of years. (vii) Technical personnel should  be  enlisted in      India as soon as  the first cadets proceed to      Cranwell and  should  be  trained  at  the      Aircraft Depot, Karachi. (viii)  The squadron will  commence forming as a      unit five years after the first  cadets proceed      to Cranwell.  It will do so  in four stages,      the final  stage  being arrived at 14 years      after the date of formation.  (ix) JTo further squadrons will  be formed until      further experience has been gained.  (x) The addition of  an  Indian squadron to the      air strength  in India must be additional to      the present authorised strength of the Royal      Air Force.10th May 1927.W. G. H.
