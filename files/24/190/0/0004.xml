[This Document is the Property of  His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;]Printed for the Cabinet.SECRET.                                                    Copy No.   30CP.  304  (27).    NEGOTIATIONS  FOR THE REVISION OF THE IRAQ TREATY.      MEMORANDUM BY THE ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    THE Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a statement to the Cabinet onthe 30th November explaining the circumstances in which it had been found possibleto resume conversations with King Feisal.    I  thought it desirable to  conduct these conversations personally,  with theassistance of Sir Henry Dobbs.   I am  glad to say they  have been  brought to a successful conclusion.  After King Feisal had given up his point about the &quot; complete independence&quot; of Iraq, the one outstanding question of vital importance was thatof the right of the British High Commissioner to tender  advice to the  Iraq Govern-ment.  King Feisal, while giving every kind of personal  assurance that he would inpractice co-operate  closely  with the High Commissioner, fought very hard for the exclusion  from the Treaty of any specific provision  giving the High Commissionerthe formal right to tender &quot;  advice.&quot;  Eventually, after prolonged discussion, a corn-promise formula was  worked out to which King Feisal  assented.   This formula isembodied in Article 5  of the draft Treaty below.    I am accordingly in a position to  lay before  Cabinet the draft of  a treaty which king feisal has accepted and which I regard  as acceptable from the point ofview of the British Government.  I submit this draft for the approval of the Cabinet.    King Feisal left London on the 5th December, but the Prime Minister of Iraq(Ja&apos;far Pasha) is on  his way back to England, and will find awaiting him on his arrival written instructions from King Feisal authorising him to sign  the .Treaty inits present form.  I  solicit the authority  of the Cabinet to arrange for  the signature of the Treaty as soon as Ja&apos;far arrives.   It has been  made clear to King Feisal thatthe Treaty will not be ratified, and consequently will not  become operative, until the revision of the Military and Financial Agreements, which is now in progress, has beencompleted.                                                                  W.  0.-G.    Colonial Office,  December 5,  1927.                      DRAFT  ANGLO-IRAQ TREATY.    HIS Majesty  the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British dominions beyond the Sea, Emperor of India,    And His Majesty the King of Iraq.    Desiring to consolidate the  friendship and to maintain and perpetuate therelations of good understanding  between their respective countries;  and    Recognising that the terms  of the Treaties of Alliance signed at Baghdad onthe 10th day of October, 1922, corresponding with the 19th day of Sa&apos;f ar,  1341,Hij rah, and on the 13th day of January, 1926, corresponding with the 28th day ofJamadi-al-Ukhra,  1344, Hijrah, are no longer appropriate in view of the alteredcircumstances and of the progress made by the Kingdom of Iraq and stand in need ofrevision; and    Considering that the revision of the terms of the said Treaties of Alliance can best be effected by the conclusion of a new  Treaty of Alliance  and Amity;    Have agreed to  conclude a new Treaty for this purpose on terms of equalityand have appointed as their plenipotentiaries I    His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British dominions beyond the Sea, Emperor of India,       [16904]
