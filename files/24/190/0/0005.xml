It is  requested that special  care may be taken                    to ensure the secrecy of this document.                                 CABINET.NAVAL PROGRAMME  COMMITTEE.Report on Cruisers.                           ORIGIN OF THE ENQUIRY.    FROM the conclusion of  the War up to the  year  1925 the  Naval estimates were dealt with on what may be called a &apos;&apos; hand-to-mouth&quot; system.  Every year,as the time for their  preparation approached,  there arose a more or less acutediscussion between the Admiralty and the Treasury as to the construction programme,which usually resulted in a compromise brought about by the  Cabinet or its finance committee.    2.  In 1925, after the usual controversy between the. Departments concerned hadculminated  in  an indecisive discussion in  Cabinet,  the Prime Minister,  at  a subsequent  meeting, summed  up the  position in a statement  which began  asfollows:         &quot; The  Cabinet has decided that  the  process of  replacing the units of the    Fleet  which  are becoming obsolete through age should be  dealt with by a    programme extending over a period of years.&quot;            (Cabinet 8 (25), Conclusion 1.)    3.   As a result, a Naval Programme Committee (similar in composition to thepresent Committee) was appointed         &quot; To consider the programme of construction for the replacement of cruisers    and other warships, including the building of aircraft carriers and the  develop-    ment of the Fleet Air Arm during the next few years, as well as the manning of    the Fleet and the development of oil fuel reserves.&quot;            (Cabinet 9 (25), Conchvsi-on 2 (b).)    4.   The advantages of a programme to be spread over some years  and announced in Parliament were further emphasised in the  Report  of the  Naval programme committee of 1925 in the following&apos; terms :         &quot; Apart  from  the financial saving, we think there are positive advantages    in the publication of an  agreed  series  of programmes,  which will enable    contracts to be made on the best terms, and  will avoid the annual  conflicts    between the Treasury and the Admiralty, with all their resulting uncertainty    and friction.&quot;            (C.P.-352 (25), Paragraph 8.)   -  [16907]                                                         B
     5.  As the result of the Enquiry of 1925 a programme of new construction fromthe financial year 1925-26 to the year 1929-30 was agreed to and communicated toParliament (Cmd. 2476 (25)).  It was hoped that the annual controversies would bebrought to an end and that, within the life of the present Parliament, at any rate,the  Estimates would year  by year be  based on  the  agreed programme.  Thisanticipation,  however, has not been borne  out.   As  the  result of  the geneva conference on the  Reduction and  Limitation of Naval  Armaments,  new factorsentered into the problem. - The controversy:between&apos;the Admiraltyiand the Treasurybroke out afresh, with the result that the present Naval  Programme Committee was-appointed          &quot;To review. the programme of Naval.&apos; Construction iri the light  of  the     situation disclosed at the recent Geneva Conference on Reduction and Limitation     of Naval Armaments,1 hot with1, a&apos; view to&apos; an1 alteration in the general policy     already announced to Parliament, but in order to ascertain what readjustments     should be made in that policy in the present and prospective situation.&quot;Questions were also referred in regard to the oil fuel requirements of the Fleet, whichare reserved for later consideration.     6.  We have, given careful consideration to the subject of whether the principleof a programme extending over a period of years is sound or not.   We are agreedthat, at any rate, the period of the programme ought not to be unduly extended!  Inthese, days of rapid development in  scientific invention affecting naval construction and the art of war it is impossible to foresee what changes may take place a few yearshence, and a programme appropriate to the year 1927 may prove out of date by 1937,whether judged from the technical or the political standpoint.   On the other hand,the policy of the Cabinet  in 1925 in adopting a programme covering a period of fiveyears appears to us  to have been a wise one.  Apart from the reasons already stated,the policy of a fixed  programme has the advantage of enabling the Admiralty to judgebroadly as to the amount of work which will be given each year to the Governmentand private dockyard establishments, and we are agreed  in attaching importance tothe maintenance, so far  as possible, of our resources for naval construction in acondition which will enable us to expand their capacity to meet any emergency whichmay arise.  We therefore see no reason for recommending the Cabinet to depart fromtheir declared policy of a programme of naval construction to cover a period of a fewyears ahead,  though we  recognise that,  as  on the present occasion,  circumstances may arise to necessitate some modification in the programme from year to year.                     THE ULTIMATE NUMBER OF CRUISERS.    7.  As a preliminary to the immediate question of the number of Cruisers to be constructed in the next few years, we have given some attention to the question ofthe total number of Cruisers at which the. Admiralty aim.  At the 1925 Enquiry (as mentioned  in the  Report C.P.-342 (25))  it transpired that the minimum  theysought to attain was 70 Cruisers by  the year 1935.  During  the early stages of the geneva Naval Conference this figure was adhered to, although, as a concession madein  the  hope of  reaching an  agreement, the Admiralty eventually expressed a willingness to include in the figure of 70 ten Cruisers of more than 20 years of  age.The Treasury regards the figure of 70 as somewhat empirical.&apos;  If the experience ofthe early part of the War (which was quoted by the Admiralty to support their case)is taken as the criterion, they maintain that the number required would be greatly in excess of 70, and perhaps as high  as 250.  The Treasury suggest that by theadoption of more, modern methods, such as the convoy system,  the figure might bereduced below 70.  To this the Admiralty reply that the figure of 70 was reached asthe result  of a careful computation of the numbers  required  to  carry out theirstrategical  plans, which provide, inter alia, for the adoption of the convoy system.    8.  The  question of  the  total  number  of Cruisers  required depends onconsiderations of so highly technical a character that we do not feel competent toexpress a definite opinion on the subject.  We note that in&apos; the Admiralty forecasts*the figure of 60 (to which must be added 10 Cruisers of over 20 years of age) will onlybe achieved during 10 out of the 20 years for which they provide, and that in some                           * Appendix to 3rd Conclusions.
years the number falls as low as 51 and 54.  If the figure  were accepted as an indispensable  minimum and the international situation  were so critical  that norisks could be run, this would involve the provision of Cruisers on a scale considerablybeyond anything  hitherto contemplated.  Fortunately this is not the case.   We donot deny that a fixed figure, calculated according to strategical  requirements  andnot aimed obviously at any particular Power, presents an appearance of avoiding a.competition in armaments.  On the whole, however, we are inclined to regret that itwas found unavoidable, owing to the course of events at the Geneva Naval Conference,to publish it.  Since, however, the figure  of 70 has become public property as theresult of what happened at Geneva, and has been  widely discussed,  we think itwould be inadvisable to alter it, though we are of opinion that  public reference to itshould be avoided as far as possible.                         THE INTERNATIONAL OUTLOOK.    9.  In considering the new factors which have arisen since the Enquiry of 1925,we turn  first  to  the  international situation.   So far as  Japan  is concerned theCommittee of Imperial Defence (who  were  consulted on the subject by  the naval programme Committee of 1925) accepted &quot; the view of the Secretary  of State forForeign Affairs that, in existing circumstances, aggressive action against the BritishEmpire on the part of Japan  within the next ten years is not a situation seriouslyto be apprehended.&quot;    In the  course of the present Enquiry we  were  informed by the  Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs that &quot;it is common ground to those  who have studiedJapanese  policy that never was Japan in recent times more  pacifist I will evensay so pacifist as she is at the present time.&quot;    If the above  statements are contrasted they indicate a distinct improvement inthe situation which, even in 1925, was by no means unsatisfactory.  Moreover, in1925, the Admiralty  felt some difficulty in  acquiescing in the Foreign Secretary&apos;view, and only accepted  it after the First Lord and First Sea Lord had entered areserve, which was withdrawn at a later meeting.  To-day, however, we believe thatthe Admiralty have no difficulty in accepting the Foreign Secretary&apos;s  statement asto the peaceful tendencies of  Japan, more especially in view of the very  friendlyattitude of  the Japanese Delegates to the Geneva Naval Conference and  of their statement that Japan had no  intention of increasing their existing programmes ofcruiser construction before 1936.    10.  The United States of America has not yet developed a large programme ofCruiser construction, and we  have so  long  a lead in  the  comparative numbers of cruisers as to give us ample breathing space.  - For the moment the American Cruisershardly affect the  strategical problem.  From a political point of view,  however, weare impressed by the statement of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in regardto Cruiser construction that          &quot; Our interest, provided  that our safety is not endangered, which is what    the Committee has to decide, I submit, is to go as slowly as we can,  to restrict    rather than to increase our building, and, therefore, not to put any weapons in    the hands of those who would urge the  Washington Administration  to embark    on  a larger building  programme than it wishes to  undertake.  We have    announced that this year we are going to build only one Cruiser.  That,  I think,    is all to the good.....The less we do, the freer play will the peaceful forces,    the anti-Steel Trust, the anti-big navy party of America have, and  the more we    do the more  their opponents will be able to  plead our example for  their own    purposes.&quot;This consideration has weighed with us in making our recommendations.                    THE CRUISER PROGRAMME FOR 1927-28.    11.  In  view of the international situation as set forth  above,  and  of  theadmittedly urgent need of economy in expenditure during the current year, we hadno difficulty in securing agreement that the original programme for 1927-28, whichwas fixed in  the White Paper of 1925 at 1 Class &quot;A&quot; Cruiser and 2 Class &quot;B&quot;Cruisers, should be cut down to  a single Class &quot; B &quot; Cruiser, and this decision was       [16907]                     &quot;                                B 2
approved by the Cabinet on the 11th November, 1927 (Cabinet 55 (27), Conclusion 3),and announced in Parliament forthwith.                     THE CRUISER PROGRAMME FOR 1928-30.     12.   Passing now  to the Cruiser Programmes for 1928-29  and 1929-30, the immediate issues presented to us by the Admiralty and the Treasury appear at first sight to be exceedingly  small.  As already mentioned, agreement has been reached upon the programme of 1927, which the. Admiralty have voluntarily reduced from 2 Class &quot; B&apos;s &quot; and 1 Class &quot; A &quot; to  1 Class &quot; B &quot; Cruiser.  For 1928 the Admiralty ask for 3 ships, all Class &quot; B&apos;s,&quot; but they are willing that these should not be laid down till the end of the financial year, i.e., that only a nominal sum of money should be  taken for them.  The Treasury, on  the other hand, is willing to provide for one ship, either Class &quot; A &quot;  or Class &quot;B,&quot; in the programme of 1928, to be laid down if desired in  January  1929, and for two more  Cruisers, either Class  &quot;A&quot;  or Class &quot;B,&quot; to be begun as soon in  the beginning  of the financial year 1929 as the Admiralty might wish.  Tt cannot be contended  that  there  is  any immediate substantial difference between these two proposals either in money or in the resulting strength of the Fleet.     13.   The Treasury claim that,  on the basis of programmes of  1, 1, 2, for the three financial years 1927,  1928 and 1929, our  strengths in 1930,  1931 and 1932 respectively would conform to all the Admiralty standards;  that it would yield a ratio of 5:3 in 8-inch-gun ships with Japan; that the United States would be so far behind as not to be in question;  and  that, apart from our strength relative to other Powers, it would provide the number of Cruisers necessary for our communications during these three years.     These contentions are not seriously disputed by the Admiralty.   It is admitted that national  safety would not, on this basis, be in danger in  these years; that we should during 1932 reach the 5: 3 ratio with Japan in 8-inch-gun ships;  and that we  should have 57 effective Cruisers.  The Treasury argued that this number should really be 64, as the  Admiralty were scrapping  7  Cruisers whose lives were from 3 to 7 years below the 20-years&apos; limit.   The Admiralty showed that it was economical to get rid of these 7 Cruisers to avoid serious expense in their repairs.  There is no doubt that this is true.   But the fact that the Admiralty feel themselves strong enough  to scrap  these  units must  be taken into consideration in judging  the sufficiency of the proposals made for the years 1930, 1931 and 1932.     Broadly speaking, we think there is no doubt that national security would  notbe endangered in  these three years if  the Treasury proposals were adopted.     14.   The real difference between the Admiralty and the Treasury comes into prominence when the programme of 1929-30 is considered.  On the Admiralty basisthere would be three new ships in 1928-29 and three more in 1929-30, a total of 7 ships in the three years in question, as against 9 published to Parliament in  the White Paper of 1925 and 4 offered by the Treasury.  We cannot say that national safety  is involved in this difference, or  that the  Admiralty standards of  naval strength will not  be substantially made good under the Treasury proposals in 1930, 1931 and 1932. Moreover, it is of course possible for the Cabinet to limit its decisionto the issue immediately before it, namely, the programme of 1928, upon which the differences of the Departments are almost nominal, and leave the question of whether the programme of 1929 should be 2,  3  or more ships, to be decided this time nextyear, when we should have fuller knowledge of the dates at which the eleventh andtwelfth Japanese  Cruisers will in fact be laid down.  This limited alternative should certainly be considered by the Cabinet.     15.   There is no doubt that the Treasury proposal to push two out of the three ships of  1928-29  from the last days of  the financial year 1928 into the first days ofthe  financial  year 1929  would constitute an  apparent  reduction  in our  naval programme, much greater than any real loss to our naval strength.  From the point of view of Parliament and the public, as well as of foreign nations,  this reduction of our paper  programme could  certainly  be represented as a new and additional gesture in favour of disarmament.   In this connection we  can claim support from the statement made to us by the Secretary of State for  Foreign Affairs, which isquoted above in paragraph 10.
    16.  So far the issues are comparatively simple.  Nevertheless, in the course ofthe argument both the Admiralty and Treasury found themselves forced to dwellupon much more remote periods.  The Treasury claim that only two ships should be&apos;built in  1929, and that that  is a sufficient provision for 1932.   The Admiraltyenvisage a resumption  in 1928 of the annual programmes of 3 ships a year for replacement purposes.   They point out that after the year 1934 the number of ourCruisers reaching the  20  years&apos; limit becomes very  serious, and  that unless  a programme of replacement is  steadily pursued we ,should in the latter part of thenext decade fall increasingly below the numbers necessary for our security.  they point out, also, that in these very years, when our wartime Cruisers will be droppingout and replacement should be, on a, larger, scale, the need, of replacing our battleshipfleet, as well as larger numbers of Destroyers and&apos;Sloops, will&apos;probably be upon us.This will entail  sharp&apos; rises  in the  Estimates and. an  appearance of  aggressiveconstruction.    17.  Against  this the Treasury say that it is wrong to build ships before theyare needed.  We lose the interest on the money, the operative  life of the ship is reduced by the number of years its  construction is ante-dated, and,  finally, that naval science improves from year to year, enabling better types of  ships to be built.They also dwell with iteration upon the statement made.by Japan at Geneva thatthey did not  intend to build any more Cruisers (beyond the 12 already announced)&quot; until after the 31st December, 1936.&quot;    The Treasury further point out that the progressive decline in  the war pensionscharge and the annual saving in debt interest through the operations of the SinkingFund yield a cumulative 5 or 6 millions a year.  In consequence it will be easier forthe Exchequer to find large sums for new construction four or five  years hence than to-day.    18.  We feel that the arguments about  this more remote period are much moreevenly balanced and more difficult to weigh than those which are  immediately beforeus. We find a great difficulty, moreover, in  forming a judgment upon  budgets and naval programmes which lie so far beyond the scope of the present Parliament thatthey are unlikely to fall within our own responsibility.  It  is clear that  a decisionto adopt the Treasury programmes for the  three years in question of 1, 1,  2, willneither endanger our safety in the resulting  triennium nor compromise  our physicalcapacity to make  larger constructions at a  later date should the Parliament and government of those days think them necessary. At the same time it is necessaryto bear in mind the demand for naval construction of other types of vessel which will arise in later years, and the effect which may be produced on public opinion at homeand abroad by a sudden expansion of our building programme in all types of vesselsimultaneously.    19.  At Geneva the attitude adopted by  this country was that we needed a largenumber of cruisers for the defence of our commerce, but that we were willing to desistfor the time being from the construction of  the large 8-inch-gun type of cruiser inwhich we had so great a superiority over the  two other Powers.  It appears to us that it would be inconsistent with that attitude to cut down our building programmetoo drastically immediately after the break-down of the Conference, but that we mightquite consistently decide to omit the &quot;A&quot; cruiser which we were  proposing to lay down next year.  Further, the retention of two of the small type of  8-inch-gun cruisersin the next year&apos;s programme would assist in the direction of providing work in the dockyards, to which we refer in paragraph 6.    20.  In these circumstances, we recommend that the Class &quot;  A &quot; cruiser shouldbe omitted from the programme for the year 1928-29 and that the programme forthat year shall consist of two Class &quot; B &quot; cruisers.  For the year  1929-30 we recom-mend that for the present the programme  should be retained  unchanged  at one class &quot; A &quot; cruiser and two Class &quot; B &quot; cruisers; but that the Treasury  should be at liberty to reopen the question of the  Class &quot; A&quot; cruiser in that year if  the  inter-national situation should have altered sufficiently to warrant a revision either in thedirection of eliminating  the. Class &quot;A&quot; cruiser or of  substituting  a  Class  &quot;B&quot;cruiser in its place.
                      SUMMARY OF  CONCLUSIONS.21.   Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows : (a.) The principle adopted in 1925 of a programme  of  Cruiser construction      extending, not over a prolonged period, but for a few years ahead, should      be adhered to.(6.) The figure of  70 Cruisers (which may include  10 Cruisers of more than      20 years of age) at which the Admiralty have  been aiming, and which      has become public property in consequence of  the course of events at the      Geneva Naval Conference, should-be referred  to as little as possible.(c.)  The programme for 1927-28, as already announced, should be limited to a      single  Class &quot; B &quot;  Cruiser, as compared  with the programme of one      Class &quot; A &quot; and two Class &quot; B &quot; Cruisers  included in the White Paper      of 1925.(d.)  The programme for subsequent years should be :           1928-29.  Two Class &quot; B &quot; Cruisers as compared with one Class &quot; A **              and two Class &quot; B &quot; included in the White Paper of 1925.          1929-30.  One Class &quot; A &quot;  and two Class &quot; B &quot; Cruisers (the same              number and  description as  appeared in the White Paper of              1925) in the absence of new and reassuring facts which may              affect the necessity for the construction  of the Class &quot; A              Cruiser.22.
