It has been  decided by the  Judicial  Committee  of         tho Privy Council              (l)  that Civil Servants  transferred to  the  service                   of the  Provisionsl Government  and later of  the                   Free state Government  who upon  retirement                   became  entitled to compensation under -article 10                   of tho  Articles of Agreement have a legal right                   to such compensation dependent  upon the construc-                   tion of the statutes ana enforceable in the                   Courts;              (2)  that the Free Btate  Government  were Y/rong in                   applying to such awards certain provisions  of                   the Treasury Minute  of 20th March 1922  , v/hich                   dealt with the reckoning of bonus for                   sup er annuat ion.         2.    The Free  State Government  propose legislation to         confirm their previous awards  and to  set  up a Statutory         Committee to deal with outstanding and future  claims,  which         will be instructed to apply the  Treasury  Minute and whose         deoisions will be final.               The Departments are advised- that, as a.  matter of law,         this proposal involves a modification of  Article 10 of the$  House of Commons Paper 55 of 1922 (Appendix B).                  -1-
 Articles  of  Agreement,  as  interpreted by  the Judicial  Committee,  and would  therefore necessitate concurrent legislation by  the  British Parliament. 3,   Article 10  of  the Articles  of  Agreement provided  as  follows:-        &quot;The  Government of  the  Irish Free  State     agrees  to pay  fair compensation on terms     not  less favourable than  those accorded by     the  (Government of Ireland) Act of 1920  to     -judges,  officials, members  of  Police ioroos     and  other xublie Servants who  are&apos; discharged     by it or who retire in consequence of  the     change  of Government  effected  in pursuance     thereof.11      The terms  accorded by the  Act of 1920 ars set out in the Eighth Schedule to that Act and arebriefly the  $ normal terms accorded  to Civil Servants on retirement for ill health under  the SuperannuationActs 1834 to 1919, as modified by an imputed addition of further service or further increments of salary.4,   When &quot;?ar Bonus was first granted to Cavil Servants it was  on the condition that it should netreckon for pension and this condition was laid down0    (he. erooivt for persons remaining under            the S\Tperannuation Act 1859 a&apos;pension            plus a lump sum described an an            &quot;additional allowance&quot;).
 in  the original  Treasury  Circular  oir the  subject. - At a later  stage  this condition was relaxed;&apos;  and  in May 1920 when an agreement was made upon the  National Whitley  Council  by whioh  tho bonus became subject to fluctuations of  the oost  of living figure,  it was provided in the  agreement, to which  effect  was  given by  Treasury Ciroular of 14th May 1920, that 75$ of the bonus ourrent at the  date of a Civil  Servant1s retirement should reckon  for pension;     That arrangement continued until the 21st  February 1922, when, in a debate in the House of Commons upon a moti . fi for the reduction of a Supplementary Super- annuation Estimate moved  by Sir Donald Maclean, a strong desire was expressed on both  sides of the House that that part of the pension which  is computed on the bonus should itself bo varied after  the Civil Servant&apos;s retirement in  relation to the cost of living.   In pursuance of und rtakings then given to tho House by Mr. Hilton Young as Financial Secretary  to the Treasury the matter was reconsidered upon the National Tvhitley Council, and a fresh agreement was made which is embodied in the abovs  mentioned treasury minute of 20th March I9rs.     This Minute provided that in the case  of Civil Servants retiring on or after  the 21st February1922, pension should bo computed upon the whole amount, instead of 75$ of th^ current bonus in addition to substantive salary,  but that  the bonuspart of the pension should be ro-aosessed quarterly
in relation to the average cost of living figure forthe preceding three months.     Such  re-assee3ment was however made subject toan overriding maximum calculated upon the full amountof the bonus actually drawn at date of retirement, onthe ground that under the ouperannuation Acts a civil servant&apos;s pension may not exceed the prescribed propor-tion of his emoluments at that date.     In the case of the additional allowance and otherlump sum awards, it was decided after consulting theGovernment Actuary, (see annexe to the Treasury Minute)that the award should continue to be calculated uponlhcJo of the bonus only.5.   The Treasury Minute of 20th March 1922 was  applied by the Minister of Finance of the Free State Governmentto awards of compensation under Article 10 of theArticles of Agreement of 1921.  Upon this part of thecase the Judicial Committee state that &quot;the Minutecannot affect the rights of officers who at itsdate had been transferred to the Government ofthe Irish Free State,   Nor could the Minister ofFinance who (as Their Lordships have held) has nodiscretion as to tho compensation to be allowedto officers in the position of the Appellantsmake the Minute binding upon them by adoptioniTheir rights must depend upon the constructionof the Statutes without referenoe to any Minute.HAccordingly on the three specific points arising out of the /
application of tho Minute, the Judicial Committee held,confirming the original decision of Mr. Justice Meredith.   (1)  that the award of a fluctuating pension supplement      in respect of bonus was in accordance with the      provisions of the Superannuation Acts and was      justified;but (2) that the fixing of an overriding maximum was      inconsistent with this arrangement and was not      justified;and (3) &quot;Upon the whole&quot; that the reckoning of 75fi only      of the bonus in the calculation of the lump sum      allowance could not be sustained.(( )  above is of little but (3)  is of considerable financial import.-MRCA).6.    The following observations are submitted:-      (1) The original limitations upon the pensionability      of the war bonus were part of the conditions of      service of Irish, as of other, Civil Servants- prior      to the Articles of Agreement of 1921 or to the      Government of Irsland Act  1920.      (2) The Treasury Minute of 20th March 1922 was      issued on, and took effect  from, dates prior to      that of the transfer of services and of the      officers engaged upon them, to the Provisional      Government of the Irish Free State,  which took      place on 1st April 1922.   This transfer was      effected under tho Irish Free State  (Agreement)      Act 1922,  which was only passed on 31st March 1922,      and there  was in fact no Government  in existence      before that date to the  service of which existing      Civil Servants could have  been transferred.      Actually,  the rule under whioh 75^ only of the
bonus vms reckonable for the calculation of the lump sura bad been in force for nearly two years before the date of the Minute.(3) It is the case that the effect of the judgmentwould be to secure to the transferred Irish CivilServants, who both under the Act of 1920 andunder the Free State Constitution wore to continueto serve on the same tenure as before, morefavourable tGrms than if they had remained in theservice of the British Government.   i&apos;n thepassage on page 6 of the judgment which deals withthe fitictuating pension supplemont the JudicialCommittee state that they &quot;do not think that thiswas the intention of tho Acts&quot;.          It was not the intention of the BritishGovernment in 1922 that the transferred civilservants should obtain more favourable ti&quot;eatmentin this matter than if they had remained in theBritish Civil Service.   Mr. Ormsby Gore in factstated in the House of Commons on 15th July 1923that &quot;Eis Majesty&apos;s Government cannot regard it asunreasonable that in these cases bonus should betaken into account in the same manner as if theofficers were retiring from the British service&quot;,and the Lord Chancellor said in the House of lords on 1st December 1922 that the determination ofthose claims on the advice of a Committee preside over by Mr,  Justice Yfylie was &quot;a thoroughly fairarrangement&quot;.(4) In the passages on page 6 of the judgmentrelating to  the calculation of the supplementaryadditional allowance in respect of bonus theJudicial Committee state &quot;The lump sum allowance,
as Meredith J. pointed cut, is not intended as acommutation payment for the purpose of investment but asan allowance for meeting the increased temporary-expenditure connected with tho officer*s retirement;  and accordingly it is reasonable that it should be regarded asan accession to the first yeer&apos;s pension and be calculated on the same b&apos;sis as that pension&quot;.     On this point Mr. Justice Meredith appears to havebeen misinformed.   Historically and actuarially theadditional allowance is in fact a commutation of part ofthe pension, the lump sum benefits under the Act of 1909having been given in return for a reduction of the previouspension scale by one fourth.   In this connection referencemay be made to the report of the Government Actuaryappended to the Treasury Minute of 20th March 1922.,(5) As regards the proposal to set up a Statutory Committeeto administer Article 10 of the Articles of Agreement of 1921with final authority, it is the generally accepted view thatthe efficient administration of a   superannuation systemrequires that the body entrusted with its day to day administration should possess the final decision.     That principle has not only been recognised index* theCivil Service Superannuation Acts, but has also been recently embodied in the Government of Ireland Act 1920(under which it is in actual operation as regards the CivilServants transferred to the Government of northern Ireland)and the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Act 1925.     The attention of the Cabinet should be drawn to the pledges given in 1921 and; 1922 by members of the Coalitionand Conservative Governments in connection with Article10 of the Articles of Agreement of 1921.     Mr.  (now Sir Austen)  Chamberlain stated on 19thDecember 1921 in reference  to  the transferred officials
"His Majesty&apos;s Government will be the guarantor of their pensions".

???

Mr. Churchill stated on 31st March 1922 "In the event of default on the part of the Irish Government the British Government accepts full responsibility for the liability... laid down in the Act of 1920".

Lord Cave state on 28th NOVEMBER, 1922 "I am certain that our Government will use all its powers to see that proper compensation is given to those who are entitled to it",

and on lst December 1922

???

"I think in the end, should the compensation not be paid we are bound to see that the just and fair thing is done. And I can repeat the assurances given before that, so far as we are concerned, we will do everything within our power to see that this term of the Treaty will be carried out and that full justice will be done".

Sir,               I have the honour to refer to your  despatch N0.is          of the 25th May last transmitting copies of the Judgment          of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the appeal          of John K. Wigg and another versus the Attorney-General          of the Irish Free State from the Supreme Court of the          Irish Free State^          2a   Tne question that originally gave rise to the legal          proceedings in this case was the mode of treatment of          bonus for the purpose of computing the amount of the          compensation allowance payable under Article 10 of the          Treaty of the 6th December, 1921, to Civil Servants          transferred to the Provisional Government, and a:&apos;.;-.( rwards          to the Government of the Irish Free State, from the Service          of the Dritish Government consequent on the transfer of          services effected in pursuance of the Treaty,,          3.   The Treaty did net itself provide any machinery for          determining claims under Article 10.   The Provisional          Government were accordingly faced with the problem either          of dealing with SUJII claims depart mentally, or, following          the precedent of the Government of Ireland Act. 1926, of          setting up a tribunal whose function it would be to consider          such claims and report to the Government as to tne action          to be taken thereon,.   The &quot;-Provisional Government adopted the he Rt.hon .The Secretary of State for    Dominion Affairs,          Downing St&apos;. . S ,W ,1spatch No, 291
 the latter course and appointed a Committee, known as the Civil Service Committee (Compensation).   This Committee consisted of two official members and two staff members presided over by a Judge of the High Court and was, therefore, in its constitution more favourable to the staff than the tribunal of seven members provided for in the Act of 1920 of whom only two were staff representatives The Committee set up by the Provisional government was advisory only, with no Statutory authority or powers, but its recommendations were invariably accepted and acted upon by the Provisional Government and subsequently by the Government of the Irish Free State.   On the retirement of the Chairman in June, 1924,  while the legal action referred to above was pending,  the Committee ceased to function, and, in the circumstances since then prevailing, has not been reconstituted.   No suggestion has ever been received by the Government of the Irish Free State that the constitution of the Committee and its recommendations were otherwise than eminently fair to the officers concerned, 40   The basis of treatment of bonus for compensation purposes adopted by the Committee and accepted by the Government of the Irish Free State was identical with that prescribed by the British Treasury Minute of 20th March,  1922,  framed for the calculation of the pensions, etc. of Civil Servants who retired  on or after the 21st February, 1922,  in order to give effect to an undertaking given by the  Financial Secretary to the Treasury during a debate in the  House of Commons that pensions would thenceforward be granted on such a basis that they would be brought by periodical re-assessment into relation with
tho cost of livingi   The Government  of the  Irish FreeState have noted that the British Government, as indicatedin the reply to a Parliamentary Question  on  the subjectaddressed to the Under Secretary of State for DominionAffairs on the-. 16th  July, 1923, regarded  the adoption ofthis basis in dealing with retirements, under Article 10of the Treaty as reasonable.5.   According to the Judgment of the  JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council this basis of treatmentof bonus fell far short of that to which  transferredofficers are entitled.     The Judicial Committee were of opinion  that the minute of 20th March, 1922, could not  be  taken intoaccount in determining the question of the amounts to bopaid to such officers on discharge or  on  retirement inconsequence of change of Government.   The following is thepassage in which the reasons for their Lordships r opinion is given:--  nIn imposing the disputed  conditions, theAdvisory Committee followed the principles laid down inthe Minute of the British Treastu&quot;&quot;y dated  the 20th March3.922, which was adopted by the Minister for  Finance onthe 11th May, 1922,  and it is necessary to consider whetherthe Minute is binding on the appellants.   In their lordships&apos; opinion ix. is not so binding.......tIt is nodoubt operative as to officers remaining  in  the service ofthe Crown in Great Britain; for, as to the pensions to be awarded to those officers, the Treasury has  a. widediscretion.    But the Minute cannot affect tho rights ofofficers who at its  date had been transferred to theGovernment of the Free State
     It is abundantly clear Iron the Judgment thatthe basis of their Lordships&apos; decision on this branchof the case was that the Minute of 20th March, 1922, wasnot binding on the officers in question because at itsdate they had been transferred to the service of theProvisional Government.6.   The Government of the Irish Free State is at a loss to understand how in face of the known and incontro-vertible facts such a conclusion could have been arrivedat.   It is undeniable that, in point of fact, neither theappellants nor any Irish Officer had been transferred tothe service of the new Government at the date of the minute of 20th March, 1922.   Such a transfer only tookplace as from the 1st day of April, 1922, and was effectedpursuant to the Provisional Government (Transfer of functions) Order, 1922, and an agreement entered intobetween Mr, Winston Churchill on behalf of the EritishGovernment and Mr, Michael Collins on behalf of theProvisional Government by virtue of which the date of transfer was fixed at 1st day of April, 1922 c  Furthermore,the terms of the Minute which had retrospective effect from the 21st day of February, 1922, expressly applied to every Civil Servant then serving, and officers in IrishDepartments who retired while still in the service of theBritish Government on or after the 21st February, 1922,had their retiring allowance calculated in accordancetherewith.7.   The Government of the Irish Free State whiledesirous of giving effect to their obligations underArticle 10 of tho Treaty cannot overlook these mattersnor can that Government fail to be Impressed by the                         -13-
consideration that the Judgment of the Privy Council if put into effect would result in more favourable  treatment being accorded to transferred officers on their subsequent retirement under Article 10 than they would have received had they remained in the British Civil Service, or than transferred officers who elect to remain in the service of the Irish Free State would receive on ultimate retirement in normal course under the superannuation Acts. Such treatment would also be more favourable than that given to transferred officers in Northern Ireland.

8. The other issue on which the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held contrary to the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State was that transferred officers had a legal right, enforceable in the Courts of the Free State, to compensation under Article 10 of the Treaty. The judgment on this point was based on the view that,  when the statutory Committee contemplated by the Act of 1920 disappeared as far as the Free State was concerned, the duty of ascertaining the amount of compensation payable under Article 10 fell to the Courts.  The Privy Council inclined to the view that under Article 10 of the Treaty taken by itself the right to  compensation would not have been enforceable by an individual citizen in the Irish Courts, but that, in the absence of the special tribunal contemplated by the Act of l920, the effect of subsequent Irish enactments was to confer this right.

9. After a careful and prolonged survey of the whole position the Government of the Irish Free State have come to the conclusion that there are not sufficient grounds to warrant their assuming the serious financial burden which enforcement of a Judgment based in part on a fundamental misapprehension of fact would entail. Such obligations are not
imposed either by  the spirit or by  the  letter  of Article  10of the Treaty ana  in  justice ana  fairness  cannot be  laid on the taxpayers of tnia country.     10.  The vioverament ox the Irish  *ree  otate also  view with grave concern the prospect which  enforcement  of theJuagmant would open up oi a continuous  series  oi actionsat law by applicants under article  10  of which no  less thaneight such actions have already been instituted or arethreatenea.   It is, however, realised  that the omission of any statutory machinery for implementing Article  10should be remedied, and it is thought  that  this could  best be done by the setting up of a Committee constituted some-what on the lines  of  th- aefunct  Civil  Service Committee(Compensation), whose decisions would  be final andconclusive.   The  Executive Council are accordingly considering the promotion  of legislation  in the Oireachtas at  a very early date for this purpose, and  also  to provide that  awards of compensation already made on the recommendation of  theAdvisory Committee shall be binding in  law,  The Governmentfurthermore consider that it is both necessary and desirableto ensure that in  assessing compensation in pending  andfuture cases the btatutory Committee shall  adhere  in thetreatment of bonus to the basis indicate a in the treasury minute of 20th March, 1922.     11.  The Executive Council feel sure  that the course proposed to be adopted, being based on  the  desire  to dojustice as between the transferred  officers and thetaxpayers of the Irish Free state,  will meet with  theconcurrence and cc-operation of his Majesty&apos;s  Governmentin Great Britain.

APPENUiXAPrivy Council Appeal No. 29 o/1926.John Howard Wigg and anotherAppellantsv.The Attorney-General of the Irish Free StateRespondentFROMTHE SUPREME COURT OF THE IRISH FREE STATE.JUDGMENT OF THE LORDS OF THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE OF THE            PRIVY COUNCIL, DELIVERED THE 3RD MAY, 1927.        Present at the Hearing :        THE LORD CHANCELLOR.        VISCOUNT HALDANE.        VISCOUNT FINLAY.        VISCOUNT DUNEDIN.[Delivered by THE LORD  CHANCELLOR.]   This is an appeal by special leave from an order of the SupremeCourt of the Irish Free State, reversing (by a majority) the judg-ment of Mr. Justice Meredith in favour of the appellants.   The appellants, who  were formerly established civil servants in the employment  of the Crown in Southern Ireland, were, bythe several instruments which effected or followed upon the estab-lishment of the Irish Free State, transferred to the service of that state.  They have since retired, and, being dissatisfied with theretiring allowances granted to them by the Minister of Finance,they brought this action in the High Court against the Attorney-General of the Free  State, claiming a series of declarations as tothe allowances to which they are entitled.   Mr. Justice Meredith,by whom the action  was tried, granted part of the relief claimed ;but,  on appeal to the Supreme Court that Court by a majority(Mr. Justice Johnston dissenting) held tiiat the action would  notlie, and dismissed it with costs.  Hence the present appeal.   On the argument of the appeal before this Board two distinctquestions  were discussed, namely, first,  whether  the appellants[45](B 40-6457)TA
are entitled to any legal rights in respect of which an action fora declaration will lie against the Attorney-General, and, secondly,whether,  assuming that such an action will lie, the appellantsare,  on the true construction of the statutes relating to super-annuation or  compensation  for  loss  of office,  entitled to  the declarations which they claim.   The questions so raised are ofconsiderable jmblic importance, both as bearing on the effect tobe given in the Courts of the Free State to the statutes and orders of 1922, and also  as affecting the interests  of a large number of former servants of the Crown.   Upon  the first question  the  respondent relied in  the  firstplace on the decisions of the English  Courts which have laid it down that a servant of the Crown has no right  under the Super-annuation Acts to sue for his superannuation allowance ;  and forthis purpose reference was made to the cases of Cooper v. The Queen(18S0, L.R. 14 CD. 311),  and Yorke  v.  The King (L.R.,  1915,1 K.B.  852).   Their Lordships do not question the authority ofthose decisions, which, indeed, was  recognised  by the House ofLords in Considine v. Mclnerney (L.R.,  1910, 2 A.C.  162) ;  but those cases turned entirely upon the language of the Superannua-tion Acts.  Section  30 of  the Act of 1834  (which has not beenrepealed)  enacts that &quot; nothing in this Act shall extend or beconstrued to  extend  to give any person an absolute  right  to compensation for past services or to any superannuation or retiringallowance under this Act,&quot; and section 2 of the Act of 1859 providesthat any question as to a claim for superannuation shall be referredto the  Commissioners of  the  Treasury,  &quot; whose decision shallbe final&apos;&quot;&apos;; and, in view of these enactments,  it was clear  thatno action could be brought to set aside or vary a decision of theCommissioners of the Treasury.   But the  claim of  the presentappellants rests, not  upon  the Superannuation Acts  taken by themselves, but upon those Acts  as modified and applied by theAgreement for a Treaty between  Great Britain and Ireland andthe statutes and orders of 1922.   By Article 10 of the agreement for a Treaty it was provided as follows :         &quot; The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair coinpensa-   tion on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920   to judges, officials, members of police forces, and other public servants who    are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of govern-    ment effected in pursuance hereof.&quot;This  article, taken  by itself, might  not have  been enforceableby an individual citizen in the Irish Courts ; but by a series ofenactments following upon the Agreement for a Treaty, it has beenmade a part of the municipal law  of the  Free State.   By  theProvisional  Government  (Transfer  of Functions) Order,  1922,clause 7, it was provided as follows :         &quot; (i) All officers who are on the -day of transfer engaged or employed    in the discharge of funotions transferred under this Order to tho Provisional    Government shall bo transferred to  and become officers of tho Provisional    Government . . .
       &quot; (ii) Where an officer is transferred to the Provisional Government under    this Order, lie shall hold office by a tenure corresponding to his previous    tenure, and if he is discharged by the Provisional Government, or if ho    retires in consequence of the change of Government effected by this Order,    he shall be entitled to receive compensation from the Provisional Government    and the terms of such compensation shall not be less favourable to  him    than such as are accorded in the like circumstances by the Government of    Ireland Act, 1920.&quot;By Act No.  1 of 1922-the statute  by  which Dail  Eirearmenacted a  Constitution for the  Irish Free  State it was enactedthat the Articles  of Agreement  for  a Treaty should  have  theforce of law; and  Articles 77 and 78 of the Constitution provided as follows:         &quot; 77. Every existing officer of the Provisional Government at the date    of the coming into operation of this Constitution (not being an officer whose    services have been lent by the  British Government to the  Provisional    Government) shall on that date be transferred to and become an officer    of the Irish Free State (Saorstat Eireann), and shall hold office by a tenure    corresponding to  his previous tenure.        &quot; 78. Ever3&apos; such existing officer who was transferred from the British    Government by virtue of any transfer of services to the Provisional Govern-    ment shall be entitled to the benefit of Article 10 of the Scheduled Treaty.&quot;The effect of these enactments, and particularly of  Article 78of the Constitution, was to give to every existing officer who was transferred to the Provisional Government, and afterwards  tothe Free State, a  right by Irish law to the benefit of Article 10of the Agreement for a Treaty with a corresponding title to enforcethat right in the Courts of the Free State.    But  it was argued  on behalf of the respondent  that, evenassuming  that the  statutes conferred a  right, they  gave  theappellants no more than  a right to put forward their claim to theMinister of Finance (to whom the functions of the British treasury in respect of superannuation have been transferred) and to receivesuch compensation  as  he might award to them.  In support ofthis view it was pointed  out that at most the effect of Article 10of the Agreement for the Treaty and Article 78 of the Constitutionwas to give to existing civil servants transferred to the Free state the rights accorded by the Eighth Schedule to the Government ofIreland Act, 1920 ;  that under that schedule  a civil servantretiring under the statutory conditions  would only  have been entitled to receive such compensation as the Civil Service Com-mittee set up by that Act might award to him in accordance withthe rules contained in the schedule ;  and that by section 58 (6) ofthe Act the determination of the Civil Service  Committee of any claim or question which was to be determined by them under theAct was to be final and conclusive.   In consequence of the estab-lishment of the Free State the Civil Service Committee has, so far asSouthern Ireland is concerned, never been set up ; and it was argued that, this being so, the right to make an award under Schedule 8of the Act of 1920 has reverted to the Minister of Finance as  the      (B 40-6457)T                                      A 2
 successor to the British Treasury.  Their Lordships do not agree with this reasoning.  It is true  that the Civil Service Committee for all Ireland has lapsed, and that by section 7 of the Irish Free State  (Consequential Provisions)  Act,  1922,  such a  Committee has been set up for Northern Ireland only ; but the effect is not to transfer the functions of that Committee as  regards Southern Ireland to the Minister of Finance.  The right of an existing officer retiring under  the statutory conditions to receive compensation in accordance with the rules contained in  Schedule S  of the Act of 1920 remains, and is converted by Article 78 of the Constitution into a  legal right; and, the machinery provided by the statute for ascertaining the amount of the compensation having disappeared, the duty of ascertaining it falls, in case of need, upon the Courts.    In this connection it is desirable to mention that, with a view to obtaining assistance in the duties falling  upon him  in  this connection, the  Minister of Finance has.set up a Compensation Committee, whose tluty.it is to advise him as to the compensation to be awarded to retiring civil servants.   This Committee consists of a Judge of the Supreme Court, who is the chairman, two members appointed by the  Minister  and  two appointed by the staff of civil servants.  The  constitution of the  Committee is eminently fair, and there can be no doubt  that its advice is of value ;  but it is an advisory Committee only with no statutory powers, and it was not and could not be contended on behalf of the respondent that its conclusions have a binding effect.    Upon the first point, therefore, their Lordships are  of opinion that the appellants have  a legal right which may be asserted in the Courts of the Irish Free State ; and they see no objection to the form of the  action, which is brought against the Attorney- General for a declaration of rights and is in accordance with the well-known decisions in  Dyson  v. The  Attorney-General (L.R., 1911, 1 K.B. 410 ;  L.R., 1912, 1 Ch. 158) and other cases.    Before  dealing with the  questions of amount  it is desirable to state in a little more detail the position of the two  appellants, the nature of the compensation  awarded to them respectively, and the questions upon which disagreement has arisen.    Each of the appellants had many years of service to  his credit, and each of them was entitled at the date of his retirement to a fixed salary and also  to a supplemental salary (or bonus) varying with the cost-of-living figure ; and in each case the notice of retire- ment,  which was given in accordance with the statutory  con-ditions  specified in the Eighth Schedule to the Act of  1920, took effect after the passing of the Irish Free State Constitution Act.But there  was this difference between  the appellants, namely,that whereas the second appellant, Mr. Cochrane, had  elected toadopt the provisions  of the  Superannuation Act, 1909, the  firstappellant,  Mr.  Wigg, had preferred to  remain subject to theprovisions  of  the  Act of 1859.   Accordingly,  while  the firstappellant was entitled,  in accordance with the Act of 1S59, to asuperannuation  allowance  equal  to one-sixtieth  of his annual
salary and emoluments for every completed year of service (subjectto the  notional increases of his  salary and years of service pre-scribed by Part I of the Rules contained in the Eighth Scheduleto the  Act of 1920), the right of the second appellant was to asuperannuation allowance equal to one-eightieth  of  his annual salary  and  emoluments for every completed year  of service(subject  to  the notional increases above mentioned), togetherwith an additional allowance of a lump sum equal to one-thirtiethof his annual salary and emoluments for every completed year ofservice, but not exceeding one and a half times the  amount of suchsalary  and emoluments.   In calculating the pensions  to  be  awarded to the appellantsthe  Compensation Committee,  whose  recommendations   were adopted by the Minister of Finance, proceeded generally upon theabove lines.  They made the proper notional increases in the salary(both fixed and supplemental) and  in the years of service of eachappellant, and awarded to each of them a fixed pension repre-senting the proper proportion of his fixed salary and a supplementalpension representing  the proper proportion of his supplementalsalary (or bonus) as so increased : but in each case they made it acondition of the award  (1) that the supplemental pension shouldbe subject to reassessment quarterly with reference to the officialcost-of-living figures from time to time declared, and (2) that at no time should the supplemental pension exceed its prescribed amountat the date of the retirement, which was referred to as the &quot; over-riding  maximum.&quot;  Further (3) in calculating  the  lump sumallowance to be paid  to the appellant Cochrane in respect  of hissupplemental  salary  or bonus,  they  calculated  that allowanceupon 75  per cent,  only and not upon the whole, of the bonus towhich he was entitled at the date of retirement.  It is with regardto these conditions  numbered  (1), (2) and (3) that the awardswere questioned on this appeal.   In imposing the disputed conditions, the Advisory Committeefollowed the  principles laid down in a  Minute  of the british treasury dated the 20th March, 1922, which was  adopted by theMinister of Finance on the 11th May, 1922 ; and it is necessary toconsider whether the Minute is binding  on the  appellants.  Intheir Lordships&apos; opinion it  is not so  binding.  The Minute  wasthe outcome of a  long  discussion between the Treasury and theBritish civil servants as to the pensionable character of the bonus,and it  is no doubt operative as to officers remaining in the serviceof the Crown in Great Britain; for, as to the pensions to be awardedto those officers, the Treasury has a  wide discretion.  But the minute cannot affect the rights of officers who at its  date  hadbeen transferred to the  Government of the Free State ; nor could the Minister of Finance, who (as their Lordships have held) hasno. discretion as to the compensation to be allowed to officers in theposition of the appellants, make the Minute binding upon them byadoption.  Their rights must depend  upon  the  construction ofthe statutes without reference to any Minute; and the question
to be determined is whether and to what extent the disputedconditions are in accordance  with the statutes.   As to the condition numbered (1) their Lordships are of opinionthat upon a reasonable interpretation of the  statutes dealingwith superannuation allowances, the supplemental  pension canbe made to vary (like the bonus on which it is calculated) with thecost-of-living figure.  If a transferred  officer were entitled on retirement to have his pension calculated upon his current bonus,without reference to any future variation, the effect might be thathe would get more by way of pension than he could have claimedif he had remained in the British service, and their Lordships donot think that this was the intention of the Acts.   The pensionmay be made to vary as the salary would have varied.   But on the  same reasoning their Lordships do not think thatthe condition numbered (2) can be sustained.  If the pension ismade to fall with the cost-of-living figure, it should also be capableof rising with that figure; and if the amount of the officers salaryat the date of his retirement is not conclusive for the piupose of preventing the  application of  the sliding scale under condition (1),neither should  it be treated  as an  over-riding maximum  as pre-scribed by condition (2).   The condition numbered  (3) raises a difficult question.  Theadditional allowance payable under section 1 of the Superannua-tion Act, 1909, to an officer who comes within the provisions of thatAct, is to be &quot; a lump  sum equal to one-thirtieth of the annual salary and emoluments  of his office, multiplied by the number ofcompleted years he has served.&quot;  There is an  obvious difficultyin applying this formula to a salary which may vary up or down from year to yeav, and  no doubt it was on this ground that theTreasury, in the Minute  above referred  to, directed that this allowance should be calculated on 75 per cent, only of the currentamount of the bonus.   But in their Lordships&apos; opinion there isno warrant in the statute for this rough and ready way of dealingwith  the matter.  The lump  sum allowance,  as  Meredith,  J.pointed out, is not intended  as a commutation payment for thepurpose  of  investment, but as an allowance  for meeting theincreased  temporary  expenditure  connected with  the  officersretirement; and accordingly it  is reasonable that it should beregarded as an accession to the first ye.ar&apos;s pension and be calcu-lated  on the same  basis as that pension.  Upon the whole their lordships are of opinion that this condition cannot be sustained.   The result is that their Lordships find themselves in agreement on every point with the  judgment of the learned Trial Judge, andthey are of opinion that the order of the Supreme. Court shouldbe  set  aside and the judgment of Meredith, J., restored.  the respondent shall pay the costs  of the appeal to the SupremeCourt; but, as on the appeal to this Board  the appellants con-tended unsuccessfully against the application  of a sliding scale totheir pensions,  there should be no  costs of that appeal.  their lordships will humbly advise His Majesty accordingly.

         TREASURY MINUTE, DATED 20TH MARCH,  1922.   My Lords have  had  under  consideration a Report by  the Government Actuary, dated 9th March, 1922, of  which a copy is appended hereto, on the question of the best method of giving effect to the undertaking given in Parliament by Their Lordships&apos; Financial Secretary, that every pension granted to a Civil Servant who retires on  or after the 21st February last shall  be granted on such  a basis  that it shall be brought by periodical reassessment into relation with the cost of living.   The  Superannuation  Acts,  1S34 to 1914,  provide, subject to certain provisos and  limitations,  that  the  retiring  allowances granted  to  a Civil  Servant shall be. according to circumstances either no. annual allowance not  exceeding the amount  of one- sixtieth  of  his  annual salary and emoluments for  each  year of service,  or  an  annual allowance not exceeding the  amount of one-eightieth  of his salary and  emoluments for  each  year of service  together with a lump sum payment, called an additional allowance,  not  exceeding  the  amount of one-thirtieth of  bis salary and  emoluments  for each year of service;  provided that the additional allowances so  computed, shall, in the case of a Civil Servant who entered the service prior to the 20th September. 1909, be increased by one-half per cent, for each completed year&apos;s service prior to  that date.   When it became evident that the bonus paid to Civil Servants in consequence of the increase of the cost of living, though temporary and fluctuating, had become a  regular part of the Civil Servant&apos;- remuneration, My Lords felt bound, in view of the provisions ol the Superannuation Acts, to take the bonus into account in coni- puting his retiring allowances, and hitherto seventy-five per cent of the bonus payable at  the time  of retirement has accordingly been  included  in the emoluments upon which,  together with the salary,  the retiring allowances have been  computed.  My Lords have now  decided  that in future that part of the annual allowance which  is computed on bonus must be brought more closely into relation with the cost of living,  at the time of retirement, and must be  subject to reassessment quarterly.  They accordingly  propose that the bonus to be included in the com- putation of  the annual allowance shall be the bonus appropriate. under the Civil Service sliding scale, to the average cost-of-living figure for the three months preceding the quarter in which retire- ment  takes  place instead of the  average cost-of-living figure  forthe six months preceding the half-year in which i-etirement take-place.  As regards the Additional Allowance, My Lords have  arrivedat the conclusion, in accordance  with  the advice of the Govern- ment Actuary, that, having regard to all the circumstances, it is not possible to devise  a  more satisfactory plan than to base theaward, as hitherto, upon 75 per cent, of the bonus, subject how-ever to  the  proviso  that, as in the case of pensions,  the bonusaddition  will be calculated  by reference to the average cost-ot-living figure for the  preceding quarter  and thus be  brought into
closer relation than heretofore with the cost of living at the dateof  the  retirement.   The same arrangement will apply  to  the calculation of the gratuities payable to established Civil  Servantsor  their representatives under  Section 6 of the  SuperannuationAct, 1S59, or Section 2 of the Superannuation Act, 1909.  My Lords have accordingly directed that all awards of pensionmade to Civil Servants retiring between the  21st feburary andthe 31st March, 1922, shall be  calculated on their substantivesalary,  and  emoluments,  together with  an addition  on accountof bonus equal to the bonus appropriate thereto under the CivilService Bonus Scheme when  the cost-of-living figure is  105,that  being  taken  as the  average  cost-of-living  figure for thethree months ending the 31st December, 1921.  On the 1st Aprilthat part of the pension  which is based on the bonus  additionwill be readjusted by l/21st for each  complete five points bywhich the average cost of  living  for  the first  three  months of1922  falls short  of or exceeds  the  average for the  months ofOctober, November and December, 1921, and a similar reassess-mcnt will  be made  each quarter.  Pensions awarded  to CivilServants retiring during the quarter ending the 30th June, 1922,will be awarded  on the basis of the average cost-of-liviug figure for the  first three months of 1922 and  will be  subject to reassess-ment on similar lines on the 1st July, and thereafter quarterly;and the same principles will be applied  to retirements occurringin subsequent quarters.  My Lords have further directed that theadditional allowance  or gratuity  shall be computed on the  sub-substantive salary  and emoluments, together with three-quarters of the bonus appropriate  thereto under  the Civil Service  BonusScheme, the average cost-of-living figure for the three monthspreceding the quarter in  which retirement takes place,  beingsimilarly adopted for this purpose.  The case  of certain Civil Servants who  are not in receipt ofthe Civil Service  bonus presents  special features.  These menare for  the  most  part in receipt  of the engineering  and  ship-building trades bonus, which is not directly related by a sliding scale  to the  cost-of-living  figure.  Having regard  to all the facts,My Lords have  decided to award  pensions on the actual  bonusreceived at the lime of retirement, such pensions to  be subjectto readjustment at the end of any quarter in which there hasbeen a change in the rate of bonus.   That part of the pension which is based  upon the  bonus will  be readjusted in the ratiowhich  the  revised bonus  bears  to  the bonus  at the  time of retirement.   The additional  allowance  will  be  calculated  on75 per cent, of the current bonus as hitherto.  Inasmuch  as  retiring  allowances  cannot under the  existing provisions of the Superannuation  Acts exceed a  prescribed pro-portion, appropriate to the retiring  Civil  Servanfs  length ofservice, of his salary  and emoluments at the date of  his retire-ment  (subject to the provisions of Section 12 of the Superannua-tion Act, 1S34), the additional allowance or pension payable atany time will be subject  to this  overriding maximum.   478C2                                                A i
 The Government Actuary.   Your  atteutiou is invited  to  the  Debutes  iu the  llouso  of Commons on Wednesday,  14th  February, and  on Tuesday and Wednesday the 21st aiu1 22nd February, on the Supplementary Fstiinates for  Superannuation allowances, and,  in particular,  to the undertaking  giveu on  the last mentioned occasion  by the Financial Secretary  to the Treasury that he would  introduce a Scheme whereby every pension  granted after the present time shall be  granted on such  a  basis that it shall be  brought by periodic re-assessments with as little delay as  possible into relation with the cost  of living.   You will observe  that the  Financial Secretary stated  that, with  regard to both pension and  additional allowance, his purpose would  be  so to apply this new alternative scheme that the  total non-effective charge for the retiring Civil Servant should bear a relation to  the cost of living.   Your advice  is sought as to the most equitable and effective method of carrying out this  undertaking, regard being  had to the provisions  of the Superannuation Acts  generally  and with special  reference  to the Additional Allowance  payable  under Section 1 (2) of the Superannuation Act, 1909.                                  (Signed)     li. It. SCOTT. Mr. Scott, Treasury.  As requested in your minute of 28th February, I have considered the question as to superannuation allowances raised by the under- taking  given by the  Financial Secretary  to  the  House of Commons.  So far as the pension  itself  is concerned,  the undertaking appears to require  that  the bonus supplement  shall vary  from time to time with changes  in the  cost oi&apos; living  index number. I concur in the view that this object will be secured as completely as practical considerations admit by the adoption of a  system of quarterly revision,  the supplementary  pension  being  fixed  in relation to a cost  of living bonus based on the average of the cost of living figures for the 3 previous months.  The additional  lump sum allowance payable under the Act of 1909 requires special consideration.  When the superannuation system was changed by the Act of 1909  the pension was reduced by  one-fourth  to allow of other benefits  being granted, the principal of these being the gratuity  of one  years salary in the case of death during active service and the allowance in thirtieths, based upon years of service, which is payable as a lump sum on retirement, in addition to the  pension.  The old  benefits and the new are of equal  value in the case of the normal  entrant into the service.  Broadly speaking, and  subject to a small and varying addition in the case of officers who retire with service before 1909, the lump sum  on retirement represents the equivalent of 22 to 27 per cent, of the  actual pension, capitalised, according to age,at from 12 to 10  years&apos; purchase; it might be argued that if the bonus addition to the pension is made  liable  to variation  with changes in the  cos! of living,  this capitalisation of a part of the
pension which would otherwise have  been payable  should  bemade on a basis which takes the element of variation into account.But  in  so far as this involves a forecast of  the future variations in the index figure it obviously presents  a problem of considerabledifficulty; any such adjustment of the  lump sum could only bebased, in fact, upon broad assumptions.  I understand, moreover,that in many cases the lump  sum  is employed  at  the  time of retirement for the purpose of the purchase of a house or on other items of capital expenditure.  In so far as it is so used it wouldproperly be assessed, in accordance with the principles of the superannuation Act, in relation to  the level of prices,  and thefull amount of remuneration payable, at the  date of retirement.  Taking all these  points into consideration,  I think that, as apractical method of allowing for the variability factor, it wouldbe fair to retain the  ratio of 75 per cent, in adjusting the lumpsums,  bo  far  as  they depend  upon bonus, especially if it  bearranged that the whole calculation  shall  be more closely related to the cost-of-living figure current at the date when  the officeiretires.  Having regard to the possibility  that, within  limits, the bonus supplement to the pension may go up, under the Statute,as well  as down, and that in any case no  reliable forecast can bemade of the course  which the index  figure will take, I think thatit would not be unfair, either to the State or  to the retiring officer,if the rights of the  latter in respect of the lump sum were valued at 75 per cent, of  the sum at which  they would  stand if the pension supplement to which  the  lump  sum is linked,  insteadof varying as now  proposed, were permanently fixed at  the rateallowed when the pension was granted.

Tiii3 case refers to the compensation (pension) under Article  10 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 6th December, 1921, directly  affecting ex-British Civil Servants, about 1,800 in number, of  whom about 400 have not yet been released from office by the Irish  Free State Government; who retired or were discharged from office  on account of the change of Government in the Irish Free State..        Article 10 referred to above stated:  &quot;The Government of the  Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation on terms not less  favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 to judges,  officials, members of police forces, and other public servants who  are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of  Government effected in pursuance hereof.&quot;        This Article was subsequently made statutory both in Great  Britain and in the Irish Free State.        As ex-British Civil Servants felt  that they had not received  &quot;fair compensation&quot; from the Irish Free  State Government,,a Test  Casti (Wigg and Co chrane versus the Attorney-General of the Irish  Free State) was instituted to determine  the matter so far back as  November, 1923, in the Chancery Division of the High Court in the.,  Irish Free State.        The oase was net heard until July,  1924, when, rs the result  of hearing both sides for several days,  judgment was given on 18th  July, 1924, by Mr. Justice Meredith in favour of the plaintiffs  (Messrs. Wigg and Cochjcans) except on one point.        The Free State-Government appealed against this judgment of  Mr. Justice Meredith, and after a hearing lasting several&apos; days&apos;,,  the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State, by a majority 0f 2  Judges to 1,  held that the action was unsustainable, and reversed  the judgment  of Mr,  Justice Meredith.                                 1.
      Ex-3ritish Civil Servants and others concerned were notcontent with this majority judgment of the Irish ifree StateSupreme Court, and decided to carry the mattor further.      After a hearing of both sides by the Lords of theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council, consisting of thelord Chancellor, Viscount Dunedin and Lord Shaw, the Eing byOrder in Council dated 16th December, 1925, granted special        appeal toleave to /Kis Majesty in Council in this case,      In the early part of 1927 this appeal was heard, lastingseveral days, by the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the privy Council, consisting of the Lord Chancellor, ViscountsHcldcne, Jinlay, and Dunedin, and Lord Shaw.      On the 3rd May, 1927, judgment was given by the saidLords whereby the judgment of the Irish Free State SupremeCourt was set aside, and tho judgment of Mr0 Justice Meredithrestored.      This had the effect of legally restoring the enhancedcompensation to Treaty Pensioners adjudged by Mr. Justice Mere-dith on 18th July, 1924.  This enhanced compensation mainlyconsisted of an increase in the Lump Sum on Bonus from n basisof 75 per cent, to a basis of 100 per cent.  ;rurther, that thepensions on bonus should be paid at the Irish Jree State Ratesof 3onus, irrespective of tho residence of the pensioner, andalso of any so-called over-riding maximum.      The above judgment of the Lords of the Judicial Committeeformed the subject of an Order of Sis Majesty in Council dated13th May, 1927, and was made a Rule of the High Court of theIrish i?ree State on 31st May, 1927.      Although in His Majesty1s Order in Council it is &quot;ordered&apos;that the same be- punctually observed, obeyed, and carried into execution,&quot; no payment of the enhanced compensation awarded asthe result of the Privy Council judgment and consequent Orderin Council has yet been made by the Free State Government either                            2.
to the appellants (Messrs, Wigg and Cochrane) or to any etherex-British, Civil Servant concerned.   The Free State Govern-nent have heen expressly written to twice by the Solicitorto the appellants and to this Association demanding payment,but so far without definite result,        In the replies of the Free State Government dated9th September, 1927, and 26th October, 1927, the followinginconclusive statements appear :-        &quot;The political preoccupations of Ministers since         the judgment was delivered has rendered earlier         consideration of these matters impracticable.&quot;        &quot;The Minister would very much regret that they (the         ex-British Civil Servants concerned) should now         feel compelled to incur the expenso and trouble         of resort to the Courts.&quot;        &quot;The whole question is at present receiving the         active consideration of the Executive Council.&quot;        &quot;The matter will be disposed of at the earliest         possible moment.&quot;       There is as yet no tangible result of these expressions.       The failure of the Irish Free State Government to pay&quot;punctually&quot; this enhanced compensation is in direct conflict with Article 10 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the judgments oftheir own High Court and that of the lords of the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council, and further, of the Order ofHis Majesty in Council of 13th. May, 1927.       After years of litigation in two countries these ex-british civil Servants who retired from their posts at considerable financial loss, as they could not see their way conscientiouslyto serve the new Government in the Irish Free State, have succeeded in obtaining a legal right to enhanced compensation;,       The 3ritish Government hsve repeatedly guaranteed theamount of this compensation to ex-3ritish Civil Servants underArticle 10 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in the event of the FreeState Government failing to honour their solemn agreement topay contained in the said Article.                              3.
      The matter now appears to resolve itself into (l)that the principal country (Great Britain) entering into the above Treaty should insiot on the other contractingcountry (Irish Free State) honouring forthwith their statutory agreement to pay the full amount of this &quot;faircompensation&quot; awarded by the Zing in Council;  or (2)the Eritish Government should pay it themselves, havingregard to their guarantees repeatedly given Iv openParliament,,       It does not seem proper that the ex-British CivilServants, about l,GOO in number, should have to embark on further litigation to malce the Order of His Majesty inCouncil of the 13th of May, 1927, effective, especially asit apxjears to be the manifest duty of the BritishGovernment to see that their own ex-officials who servsdthem in Ireland faithfully and well and often undercircumstances of danger and peculiar difficulty, are notleft any longer &quot;in the air.&quot;       It must not be forgotten that these ex-CivilServants commenced their official career under the BritishGovernment and were transferred aga.inst their will andwithout being consulted to the Irish Free State Government025th November,  1927.
