The  King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.                             DECEMBER 22, 1927.MY LORDS AND  MEMBERS OK THE  HOUSE  OF COMMONS,    1 HAVE followed with constant interest the journeys of My Sons, the prince of Wales and  Prince George, to Canada, and also of My Son  and Daughter-in-Law.  the Duke and Duchess of York, to New Zealand. Australia  and other partsof My Dominions.  1  rejoice in  their return,  and  1  have learned from themwith deep satisfaction of the loyal and enthusiastic welcome which they invariablyexperienced throughout their journeys.    It gave Me particular pleasure in  the course of  the summer to receive in Mycapital the President of the French Republic accompanied by the French Ministerfor  Foreign Affairs.  The visit gave;  fresh evidence of  the cordial relations sohappily established between My Government and the  Government  of the republic and afforded My people  a  welcome opportunity of demonstrating their affectionfor France in the persons of these two eminent statesmen.    The visit  of the King of  Egypt  was a,  source  of  gratification  to  Me  andafforded  au opportunity for a  full exchange of views  between the EgyptianPrime Minister and My  Foreign  Secretary.  The frank  and  friendly nature ofthese  conversations was in itself of good augury for the future and it  is My hopethat their outcome may prove of lasting benefit to both countries.    T  have watched with profound sympathy and satisfaction  the steady growth in influence of the  League of Nations and the increasing part which it  plays incomposing international differences and preserving peace.  The recent meeting ofthe  Council at Geneva marked a further stage in  this progress.  My Governmentwill continue to base its policy on loyal co-operation with  the League.    A Conference with  representatives of  the United  States of  America  and japan was held at Geneva, at  which the delegates of My Government  putforward proposals  for  the  future  limitation of  armaments,  which  if  acceptedwould have led to substantial reductions in naval strengths and costs.    I  regret that though  much community of  view was revealed, it  was  notpossible to reach a general agreement.  But in spite of  this temporary failure,My  Government have no intention  of embarking upon an  increase of  their navalbuilding  programme, which  is based  upon a considered view of the defensiveneeds of My wide-spread Empire.    A Conference, attended by Governors or other  senior  officials representingtwenty-six  Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories, assembled in may to exchange views on proposals of common interest to the Colonial Empire.  Thisyear has  also  been  marked by important  Inter-Imperial  Conferences in  Londondealing with education  and agricultural  research.  I am confident of the great value  of such meetings, not only in the results achieved and the recommendations made,  but  also  in bringing together, in  a  spirit of comradeship and  mutual assistance, those who are engaged in similar  work  in widely separated parts of  MyDominions.    My Government having decided that the time is ripe for the initiation of the inquiry into the working of the system of government in India for which the  lawprovides, I have, with the concurrence  of both  your Houses, issued a Commissionto seven of your number who will shortly embark upon their momentous task.  I earnestly trust that their labours may be crowned with success, and that from theircounsels may emerge a system of government which shall  give contentment to the peoples of India and strengthen the bonds that unite My Empire.

     A new treaty between Myself and His Majesty the King of Iraq, to replace tlie existing treaties between us, has been signed by Our respective representatives. The text of this treaty has been laid before you.     During (lie past  year Agreements have been concluded with  tho Greek and Serb-Croat-Slovene Governments providing for the settlement of their respective war debts to this conn try.  The terms of the Agreements have been presented to Parliament, and, as in previous cases, they give effect to the policy adopted by My Government to limit the claims on our Allies lo such amounts as, together with our Reparation Receipts, will cover the. obligations  My Government has itself to meet in respect of War Debts.   1 note with satisfaction  that; funding Agreements have now  been signed  in respect;  of all  the Allied  War Debts to  this country, except that of Russia. MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE  OK COMMONS,     I thank you for the provision yon have made for the public service. MY  Loans AND MEMBERS OF THE  HOUSE OK COMMONS,     My Ministers continue to  watch closely the state of employment which, though  showing  welcome signs of improvement  in  some  parts of  the  country, still gives cause for anxiety in others.  To facilitate  the transfer of labour  from industries  with restricted opportunities for employment and  in  particular the coal-mining industry, a Board is  to be appointed to  recommend the executive action to  be  taken   by the Departments concerned.   My  Ministers look  with confidence  for co-operation from  all who can assist in  this work both  at home and overseas.    A Bill  has been passed placing the system of insurance against unemployment upon an improved permanent basis.    Striking progress has been  made during the  past year in providing  housing accommodation  for the people  and the  number of  new  houses completed in England and Wales since  the Armistice now exceeds one million.    During the past year  a greater number of new houses have been completed inScotland than in any  previous year.  Substantial progress is also being made withthe clearance of insanitary areas and the rehousing of displaced tenants.    A Bill  has been  passed to declare and amend the law with regard to Trade Disputes and  Trade Unions.    I have given  My assent to the Landlord  and Tenant Bill, the provisions of which will  secure to certain classes of tenants compensation for the loss of good- will attaching to their premises and for unexhausted improvements, and will effect other desirable alterations in the law.    A Bill  has  been  passed  which  it   is  hoped  will  materially assist the development of the British  Cinematograph Film Industry.     A Bill has also  been passed  providing for the reorganisation of certain legal services and the amendment in certain respects of the law relating to Sheriff Court business in Scotland.     It is My earnest  prayer that the blessing of Almighty God may rest  upon all your^past and coming labours.
