At the Meeting of  the Cabinet  on the  23rd  November.  1927        (Cabinet 57(27)  Conclusion  15),  after  the Prime  Minister had        drawn attention  to a Memorandum  v/hich  he  had received from        the Postmaster General setting forth the  altered position        of  the  Cable Companies since the introduction of the four        Beam  -Vireless Services between the United Kingdom and Australia,        Canada,  India and South  Africa,  the  Cabinet agreed  that  a        Committee  composed of -                     The Secretary  of  State  for  Scotland                             (In the Chair).                     The Postmaster General                     The Acting  Secretary of State  for the  Colonies                     The Eii.financial  Secretary to  the Treasury                     The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State                                    for Dominion Affairs.                     The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State                                    for Indiax                     The Parliamentary Undei&apos; Secretary of State  for Air        should  examine the situation which has arison as a  result of        the competition  with the Cable Companies  of the  Beam V7ireless        Services and report to the  Cabinet on  the policy to be adopted        by  the  Government in regard to the matter.        2.      In  the short time at our  disposal  it has  not been        possible for us  to examine  the problem of the competition of  the        cable and  beam services  in  sufficient  detail to  justify  our        submitting definite recommendations  to the  Cabinet  on the        subject  of the policy to be adopted  by the  Government.    We                                1.                   x Subsequently added  to the Committee   see                             Cabinet 59(27)  Conclusion 7.
propose to deal with this aspect of the question in a laterReport which we hope will be ready for the consideration-ofthe Cabinet before the close of the Session.   As a result,however, of our enquiry up to date, we are satisfied that  forstrategical and other reasons, it is essential that the greathulk, if not the whole, of the cable services should bemaintained for many years to come, that those services cannotbe maintained on an economic basis in present circumstances in face of the serious &amp;nd growing competition of the wirelessinterests, raid that it is necessary to find some permanent solution of the problem which will secure the continued efficientmaintenance of the cable services, if possible without recourse beind- had to public funds,3.     In connection with the question under consideration,our attention has been specially drawn to the following urgentmatter on which a decision of the Cabinet is necessary.In a recent telegram from the Canadian Government, dated ICthNovember, a suggestion was made, with special reference to theposition of the Pacific Cable &quot;that a Committee should be  set&quot;up in London comprising representatives of the four interested&quot;Governments, to consider and report on the whole commercial&quot;position of the Cable and questions of broader policy as  to&quot;the future management, and particularly.as to how the cable&quot;and wireless systems can work together for their common&quot;advantage.   Representatives of this Committee should bo&quot;invited to make concrete suggestions as tc ho\v the cable  might&quot;best be operated in future.   Immediate appointment desirable&quot;as the cable is losing money daily due to wireless competition,&quot;and the whole question is becoming a very serious one for all&quot;the Governments concerned&quot;.
4,     This suggestion is supported by the Government  ofthe Commonwealth of Australia whose telegram of November.24th is in the following terms :-        &quot;Following from Prime Minister.  My Government         considers immediate appointment of Committee         proposed by Canada most desirable.,  Committee         shown -Llci comijrice members familiar with the         operations of both systems and capable of         sound financial appraisement..  Should you concur,         please advise how many representatives your         Government considers desirable and suggest terms         of reference.  CoEmlttee should be asked to meet         at once and report as soon as possibles         Repeated to Canada and New Zealand ends.&quot;5,     It is clear that the whole question will have to bediscussed with the Dominion and Indian Governments before any final decision is reached, and in all the circumstances ttrPconsider thtt discussion at such a conference would be thebest and more expeditious mode of procedure.  V/e think,however that the conference should examine the question as  awhole and should not be restricted merely to the pacific cable aspect of the matter.  In view of the very serious financial consequences of the present competition of thebeam with the  cable services on the eastward route toAustralasia, South Africa and India, we feel that no useful purpose would be served by Inter-Imperial discussions fromwhich this vital portion of the problem was excluded and inwhich the Governments of India and of the Union of SouthAfrica did not participate,6.     V/e are advised by the Dominions Office that if such aconference is held there would be no necessity to invite the attendance, at all events in the first instance, of represent&apos;atives of the Irish i-h-ee State, Newfoundland and SouthernRhodesia.  The Colonies and Protectorates should, however,be specially represented in view of their great interest-in the maintenance of efficient cable services.                           So
7.      The terms of reference of the Conference might be -           &quot;To exsRone the situation which has arisen            as a result of the competition of the Beam            Wireless oith the Cable Services, to report.            thereon end to malce recommendations with a            view to a common policy being adopted by            the various Governments concerned&quot;0.&apos;/e recommend the Cabinet -     (l)  To approve the proposals -         (a) that an Inter-Imperial Conference             should be held in London as soon             as possible,  composed of represent-             atives of the Governments concerned,             namely -                    Great  Britain                    Canada                    The Commonwealth of Australia                    Hew Zealand                    The Union of South Africa                    India            and also of representatives of the            Colonies and Protectorates,         (b) that the terms of reference cf the            proposed Inter-Imperial Conference            should be -            &quot;To examine the situation which has            arisen as a result &quot;of the competition            of the Beam Wireless with the Cable            Services, to report thereon and to            make recommendations with a view to            a common policy being adopted by the            various Governments concerned.&quot;(2)  To settle the representation of the    British Government  at the proposed    Conference.(Signed on behalf of the Committee)JOKKf GILHOURChairman.2,  Yvhitehall Gardens, S.W.1C     6th December, 1927.
