The Committee have  had before thorn two and               of proposals put forward by the Minister of Health,               the one dealing  with the futuro of Public Assistance               for the unemployed generally, the other with the               present emergency in the mining industry.   This               interim report deals with the latter only.SURPLUS LABOUR  1.  The problem of surplus labour has becomeIE KIHIEGA33AS; ITS     acuto in &quot;the mining industry.   The  consequencesSIZE AHDCOECSETRATIOS. of pcst-war conditions and many of the effects               of the strike have not passed away and are not               likely to pass away,   Moreover some of the               remedies - very proper remedies - are calculated               to intensify the difficulty.    Under the Mining               Industry Act and by the  other meastwires which               are being taken within the industry itself,               increased efficiency in  organisation and               working methods is being introduced.    The               result in employment must inevitably be that
the maximum output which can be regarde-i assaleable will be produced by an appreciablydiminished number of men, although it may boexpected that tho men who continue to be employedwill be employed more regularly and generally onbetter wages.   The surplus therefore oannot betreated as ephemeral.   It must be a matter ofoonjeoture exactly what the size of it is.There are at present 130,000 wholly unemployedminerE and 90,000 on short time.  The surplustherefore may be anything between 100,000 and&apos;200,000.   This figure though large Is notproportionately higher than other industrieshare experienced, or than the industry itselfhas known during the past 5 years.  Its serious-ness consists in its concentration both within afew coalfields, and within a limited number of areas within each of those fields.  The wholeeconomio life of those areas Is virtuallydestroyed when the collieries close down finally.The coalfields most affected are South Wales,the Eortbern Field, part of Scotland and probablypart of Lancashire.   This Report is directed to the problem causei by those &quot;pockets1 ofunemployment, and the proposals below aim at adispersal of the unemployed surplus to areas whereemployment&apos; is available.
     The figure of 100 - 200,000 is a gross figure&quot;to rchich several limitations must be applied.   To begin with it sill be reduced automatically through wastage.Further, the lowering of the pension age as from january 1928 will probably take out of the industry anumber of the older men.   In addition, on the experienceof last year, a net figure of approximately 30,000 menmay be expected to be transferred from the coal miningindustry to other industries.   This diversion of course is. likely to increase in extent in trade Improves inother industries.   Lastly, approximately 15,000 to20,000 vacancies annually for the next two years whichin normal circumstances would have been filled by menfrom outside the coal Industry are, by Section 18 of theMining Industry Act, reserved for persons within theindustry.   Through the operation of these variouscauses the gross figure of the surplus In the next twoor three years In the coal mining industry may probablybe reduced to a figure of from 100,000 to 140,000;  andthe problem is how to maintain those 100,000 to 140,000.employable men and how to transfer as many as possible toother Industries.     In any case this transfer is bound to be a gradualprocess, and the policy and expenditure of the Governmentshould be directed not to helping such men to remainIdle in comparative comfort in tbeir own area,  but to
                  facilitate their transfer to other areas, and                  indeed to put some pressure on them to moTe. &apos;SB                   2.    Under tho Unemployment Insurance(L/IIBSBURCH&quot;JXI*II.              Bill now &quot;before Parliament, the existing                  provisions are maintained for a period of two                  years from next ..pril, and broadly speaking,                  from that date and in ncrmcl times, any man                  who can show that he has 30 contributions to                  his credit in the procoding two years can draw                  up to his 78 weeks1 unemployment benefit                  continuously, provided,  of course, that he is                  physically capable of work, and satisfies the                  competent authorities that he is making                  proper efforts to find work.   In normal times                  &quot;15 spells of work in a  year&quot; is not&quot;a harsh test                  of a man1s genuine wish  to obtain employment.                  Uhemployment Benefit for a man, wife and                  three children will amount to 30s* a week,  end thus                                              the &quot;Blanesburgh&quot;                  Bill definitely accepts  for the Central                  Unemployment Fund by far the/
              greater part of the burden of relieving poverty              caused bp unemployment which local Authorities              might otherwise have to face.                     The policy of the Bill has gone to the extreme              limit of what is safe and any attempt to raise the              figures of benefit abovo those in the Bill would              greatly diminish the inducement to men to work for              a living.  It is very important that the swale of              this assistance to local authorities from a central              Fund, should be given the fullest publicity in and              b oyond r arliamentaISTIEGr        &apos;.-3..   The Ministry of labour are already making everyCIHTISS3 THE         effort possible to restore the fluidity of labour0AUSPERD TRAI32-      They have two training centres for unemployed men toS OPRPIUS         be trained for work on farms overseas so that they maySOUS.              take advantage of the assisted passage schemes under              the Empire Settlement Act and these are being extended.              They have, in addition, two centres, and a further centre              has just boon authorised by the Treasury, where              unemployed men ere given instruction in the use of tools,              taught shop discipline,, and make generally more handy               for other jobs,  i&apos;or juvenile-;,, the Ministry have              arranged.

TheCentral Committee on Women1s Training has established similarcentres for training women for domestic service.4.   The problem of surplus juvenile labour in the mining areasdiffers from that of adults.  The whole position of juvenilelabour in all industries will be profoundly affected by thewar-tire birth rate.  Within two years and increasing rapidlyfor three of four years there will bo a decrease in the numberof juveniles available for employment amounting by 1932 to 20^S- about 400,000, as compared with 1927.  Already the- firstsigns of the c o?tLng shortage are being felt in some areas.There will therefore be a clear demand for juvonile labour,and ample opportunities for the absorption of boys from mining areas, provided that they are made suitable for othGr indus-trios by the training schemes outlined above.  The problem.of adults is *,ven more urgent but will be more difficult,  asthe labour market i2, generally,  well supplied with unskilled labour.  It is the duty of the industrial oommunity to help the Government in the task of tx*ansferring this good employ-able labour from congested to other areas.   V/ith the trainingsohemes outlined above, and the proposals below, it will bepossible to make appreciable progress in reducing the evil,if the co-operation of other industries is seoured. 5.   The Committee have carefully weighed the foregoingoonsidorations and are of opinion that the situation canonly be met by some measure which will have the doubleeffect of convincing the country that the Government is                               -6-
earnestly grappling with the problem of surplus labour in-congested areas, and at the same time of evilisting the active co-operation of the public departments, of employers and of voluntary agencies in the task of training and transferring                                        of the committee it elsewhere-   The first step, if     3Cheme/is adopted,will be for the Ministry of Labour to schedule the areas whichin its opinion require the application of special emergency measures for the transfer of surplus labour,     The Committee propose that a temporary Board, consistingof not more than three members, chosen on their personal merits,and not as representing any sectional interest, shall beappointed.   This Board should be appointed for a period of                                            thetwo years, as an emergency ooay to deal with /transfer oflabour from the scheduled areas and should work through themachinery of the Ministry of Labour, the Board of Trade, theBoard of Education, t?ae Ministry of Health and the oversea settlement Committee..   It should not be another Government                                                   of courseDepartment, nor  should  it be merely advisory^   It would/bepossible for any Department interested to remit to the Boardquestions on which the Board&apos;s help was sought, but  theCommittee would expect the Board to Initiate  executiveprocedure to be carried out by the Departments or allocated to voluntary agencies.   7,&apos;hile the structure  of the  policyand the recommendations to the appropriate departments tocarry it into effect will be the work  of the  Board,  and theCommittee will  look to it to give the policy  life, it wouldappear appropriate that the Minister&apos; of Labour, who  ischiefly  concerned with the  solution of problem                  should be the Minister responsible toParliament for  the work of  the Board/  .                              -7-
