PERSONAL.35, BeTgr&amp;ve Square,       S1.December 1st, If27.Dear Prime ?:inister.,          I am desired to ac?-cno?/ledge the  communi cat ion  ofthe 26th November.   Additional evidence continues to reachus, particularly from the r-treat Industrial Centres, of the urgency of effecting real and substantial  economy in public expenditure both National and Local, and of the disastrousresults to the Government Party in the constituencies if thisis not done.   &quot;Ye fear that this is not fully realised byyourself or by members of the Cabinet.          &apos;.Ve have already urged National and public reasonsfor economy and need not repeat them.          In these circumstances, ve respectfully ask for a considered reply to our letter of the 2 3rd November addressedto von on behalf of some seventy &quot;embers of our Party.                         Yours sincerely,                            (Sgd. )  JOH- GP.ETT01T.
