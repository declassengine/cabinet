THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  property  OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT 3Ssorot.                     Cabinet                Copy No.F.509 ( 27)                   Agricultural Co-operation.           Memorandum by  the Minister of ^rloulfaxre  and tPlsheriea ,            1.    A condition  of affairs has  aUrsen in regard to      agricultural co-operation which  seems  to  call  for Government      aotion and 7/hioh I desire to submit  for the consideration      of the Cabinet.            2o    Briefly,  the Agricultural Wholesale Society, which      was  a large body promoted shox^tly after the War with a good      deal of semi-official support, has gone into liquidation, and      as a result of what is  known as  the  Biddulph judgment  in the      House of Lords,  a  number of agricultural  co-operative  societies      find themselves  unexpectedly confronted with a liability to      pay  for shares which under a legal interpretation of the rules      they were bound  to take in the Wholesale  Society.  The      liability arose  from an alteration of  the rules of the      Agricultural Wholesale  Society whioh required  members1      societies to take  up shares in proportion to their turnover..      The  pecxiliar and striking feature of the  matter is that though      the  societies  could have attended the  meetings at whioh the      rules were altered,  and are   responsible really for their      own  position,  in fact many of them omitted through ignorance      to take the necessary steps, and many  of  them  appear to have      been unaware of  their liability, while others  though perhaps      technically aware  thought that they  were  not bound by  the      alteration of  the  rules owing to the fact that they  did not      take up the shares in question.  On  the other  hand these      last did not definitely withdraw from  the society so that      they are now legally liable.  -In certain  oases the position      is really astounding; for instance,  one soolety which  had      two  shares on  which 5/- each was paid  and which had  no direct      dealings with  the  Agricultural Vfholesale  Society, has  been
presented v?ith a claim for over  5,000, and there are other cases of a similar though less extreme nature.     3.    Tho matter has reached a point whore the liquidatoris bound to take legal   measures.  This will result in anumber of societies becoming bankrupt, while others if not actually bankrupt will be loaded with debts with theresult that agricultural co-operation would receive a mostserious setback.     4e   I think it is desirable, therefore, that theGovernment should come to the aid of these Societies.  As anatter of policy, the Government has always advocated In general terms co-operation in agriculture, and the other two political parties are perhaps even more committed to the principle ofco-operation than the present government  There is therefore no reason to anticipate opposition at any rate from the official representatives of either group*     5.    The matter is complicated by the fact that Sir LeslieScott and Sir Francis Acland, who wore both prominent supporters of the AcVjcSo, are also guarantors for considerable sums andpersonally stand to lose a good deal of money over the business.As Sir2 Leslie Scott is still a member of tho House of commons and S*ir Francis Aoland was f ormerly a member, it will be necessaryto make it clear to Parliament that any relief given to thoseco-operative societies whioh are debtors to the A.W.S. does not become Indirectly a grant to these gentlemen by lessening theextent to which they are oalled upon to fulfil their guarantees.I attaoh a note of tho suras involved.     6.    fte need have no hesitation in assuring the House,that both these gentlemen were actuated entirely by motives ofpublic spirit and were entirely disinterested.)  This is oommonknowledge.  The arrangement which I propose below is that theGovernment contribution should only be applied to assist the
Societies to make up the amount which the liquidator estimateshe can obtain from them if he enforces to the full his legalrights.   It will aot in any way increase this amount, andtherefore the position of these two gentlemen as guarantors willnot in any way be impz-removed by any Government assistance whichmay be given.   On this point, I suggest our position will be quites ound.     7.   A second not less Important point is to see that action taken in this matter does not create a precedent whichwould Involve the State in future commitments,   I cannotsay definitely that there.is no other analogous case, butI am prepared firmly to resist any claim which may be putforward on this ground, and the circumstances are so exeptional and peculiar thai; I anticipate no difficulty in doing this.     8.   The proposal tha1* I wish to make Is that provision should be made in the Estimates of my Department for 1928 for asum of  50,000 to be applied by way of grant to AgriculturalCo-operative Societies as a part contribution to enable them todischarge the claims made by the liquidator.   The total amountof these claims is  iolj.,000, but it is believed that theliquidator will be willing to accept a smaller sum, possibly 70,000 in settlement, and it is proposed that the Governmentcontrib\jtion in that case should only be  55,000.   Until thematter has been approved in principle, however, It is impossibleto discuss details with the liquidator and other persons concerned,and I ask, therefore, for authority to negotiate subject to amaximum limit of  50,000,     9.   Owing to the impossibility of full discussionuntil this authority is given, a final scheme cannot be submitted,but my proposal is to inform the National Farmers&apos; Union as therepresentatives of the Co-operative Societies that, subject tothe approval of Parliament, the Government would be prepared tomake a grant of  35,000 provided the National Farmers&apos; Union can come to an agreement with the Societies for the payment of balanceof the liquidator^ claim, the Government grant only to be paidto the liquidator when the balance has been collected from the                            5o
societies and paid over.   This proposal would be subject to theagreement of the liquidator, and there are a number of detailswhich on further examination may bo found to present difficulties.     10.  If after discussion the scheme outlined abJorcmar some modification of it should prove impracticable, I see no alternative but to allow the liquidator to enforce his claims.In thot case, however, the Government could still offer to assistefficient  Societies whose available capital had been seriously depleted by payment of the claim, and I should proposeto employ the  50,000 (or smaller sum) mentioned above for thispurpose, either by grant or by loan.     11.  3y the adoption of one or other of the schemes it slllfI hope, be- possible to avoid the very serious setback whichagricultural co-operation would otherwise experience, and toshow in a practical &quot;way the determination of the Government togive assistance to the agricultural industry T?here possible.     12,  Arising out of this is a proposal for a short Billto prevent the liability of members of Societies registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 189J, being increased by an alteration of the Rules without their consent inwriting..   I suggest that this Bill should be introduced as aGovernment measure.try of Agriculture and Fisheries?th December, 1927.W.G.
