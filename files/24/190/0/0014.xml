COPT NO.   &apos;                                                                                 O                                  *CP.  314 (27).THE CABINET.FURTHER  REDUCTION  OF  THE  CHINA GARRISON.      MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE  FOR  WAR.     I attach a note by the Chief of the Imperial General  Staff&quot; recommending that  the    0834th  Light  Brigade, Royal  Artillery,  at  present stationed at  Hong Kong, should be    5651withdrawn from China as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made.     I ask the Cabinet&apos;s sanction for the proposal.                                                             J. G.                                              (Jbr the Secretary of State for War).  THE WAR OFFICE,      Vdth December, 1927. MEMORANDUM  BY THE CHIEF OF THE  IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF        ON A FURTHER REDUCTION  OF THE CHINA GARRISONS.     At the meeting of the China  Committee of the Cabinet on 17th November, 1927, itwas  stated that  in view of the recommendations of the British  authorities in China nofurther immediate reduction of British forces was contemplated.     2. All such recommendations have, however, been in terms of battalions of infantry,and with a view  to the urgent necessity for economy I have been  considering whether itmay not  be possible to effect  some reduction without  affecting the infantry strength ofthe reinforcements in China.     3. At the time of the despatch of&quot; the 4th Light Brigade, R.A., which accompanied the loth  Infantry Brigade, there was still a possibility of external attack on the ShanghaiSettlement, and the threat  of a southern advance on Tientsin and Peking necessitated theconsideration  of  mobile forces to act on the line of  communication between Tientsin andthe sea.     4. The only apparent  danger to Shanghai is  now that of mob violence, for dealingwith which light artillery is unsuitable and unnecessary, while the threat to Tientsin has,at least for the present, disappeared ;  should  it  recur  there is reason to believe that theJapanese will be  prepared to assume the principal burden of its defence.     5. I am of opinion that the presence of the 4th Light Brigade, R.A., in Hong Kongis  no longer necessary,  and General  Duncan  concurs  in this view.   I therefore requestpermission to  withdraw it during the current  trooping  season  as  soon as shipping-arrangements can be made.     The fact that the 4th Light Brigade, R.A., is located at Hong Kong should  obviateany political objection there may be to any further reduction of our forces in China.(B27/17)  100 12/27  W.O.P.  3406
