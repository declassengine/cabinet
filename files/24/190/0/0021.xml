I circulate for the information of my colleagues a record of the meeting of my Advisory Council held inDecember,     On the uhole the improvement in trade which I reported last month appears to be maintained.   The reports receivedby the Federation of British Industries are summarised as showing a general trend in the direction of firmness andmore active business.    The export figures for Novembershow a great advance on the corresponding figures for1925* and are probably equal in volume to an average month of1913.P.C.-L.Board of Trade, 31st December, 1927.

COAL.&apos;     LORD GAIjSFORD reported in regard to coal and coke, thatthe position on the north-east coast was just the same as ithad been a month ago.  Stormy weather had interfered withshipments to a certain extent, and unscreened coal remained at about 13/6d a ton, and coke at about 17/- a ton f.o.b.for shipment.  There had been no increase in prices of housecoal, but the demand was slightly better owing to the  colderweather.     MR. WARHAM wrote:     &quot;The conditions of the coal trade today are very  similarto the conditions prevailing during October.  The exportingcollieries are losing money, though they have the advantageof some good contracts which come to an end early next year.It will then be impossible for them to carry on for any length of time on the present ba3is.  Efforts will be madein some districts to get the men to agree to a lowering ofwa^es costs.     &quot;Schemes are being proposed in South Wales and in yorkshire, Derbyshire and ITotts for controlling prices.  TheSouth aales scheme seems to depend on a reduction of output;the Yorkshire plan appears to aim at increasing exports bysubsidising them with money gained by higher prices to \echarged in the home market.  The results will be watchedwith the keenest interest by all other districts.     &quot;The output of the country has risen slightly over thefive million tons a weeic mark, the output for the vveekending 19th November being 5,073,000 tons,  or 9 .3^. of the march 1325 weekly average basis.  The number of pereousemployed in the industry was 86.7^ calculated on the same basis.  Unemployment for the month of October has be^i 13,7^- -about the same as September.  The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom in October was 4,141,106, ascompared with 4,242,3^6 tons in September, but the value was2d per ton less.     &quot;The outputs of France and Germany for September show aslight fall, but Poland show3 a further increase, being nowalmost exactly one million tons more than in March 1S26.     &quot;V/e are informed that the attempt to set up monopoliesfor the export and import of coal to Spain has been abandoned, which is satisfactory to the British coal trade.   Un-fortunately, restrictions still exist, and contracts whichused regularly -to come to this country have quite recentlybeen diverted by the Spanish Authorities to Spanishcollieries.&quot;                    .  GAS INDUSTRY.     SIR DAVID MILNE WATSON said that there was not much further to report since the last meeting of the Council.  Afurther reduction in price had taken place in the case of alarge number of gas undertakings.  The residual markets werein very much the same position as they had been with very few alterations in prices.
IRON AND STEEL.     LORD GAINFORD stated that there had been really no changesince last month in the steel trade.  Steel makers on thenorth-east coast were still compelled to close down at least one day every week.   One fair order for rails had been issued from the London, Midland and Scottish Railway; two-thirds ofthe rails had been ordered from the Midland steel makers, andthe north-east cor.st had had the greater proportion of theremainder.  Orders had been placed for ships, but the steelmakers had not felt the benefit of that side&apos;in the north-eastern district yet.   Apparently, all shipbuilders were holding off and not buying their steel, hoping that prices would drop still further.   Imports of both finished and semi-finished steel were coming mainly, apparently, from Belgium.     The market for foundry pig iron showed no sign ofimprovement at the moment.   Stocks remained about the same.According to the general impression, Continental competitionwas probably not quite so severe as it had been.  Buyers werebuying from hand to mouth.   A central selling agency forfoundry pig iron in Scotland had been established by threelarge Middlesbrough makers, and it was confidently anticipatedthat competition in Continental foundry iron would be morethoroughly dealt with in consequence.   In regard to hematite,three furnaces had recently been put out of operation on thewest coast, and there appeared now to be 11 blowing on thatcoast.   More hematite iron was apparently being made thanthe market could take up.     MR. BOND reported that the number of furnaces inoperation stood at 162 at the end of October and was still at about the same figure, furnaces which had been blown out.having been offset by furnaces resuming operations.   The pro-duction of pig Iron in October had amounted to 596,300 tons,and the production for November would probably prove to beabout the same.   Steel works were still working much belowcapacity, the production in October having been 699-,000 tons.A total demand existed sufficient to keep our steel worksworking at full capacity, but unfortunately a large proportionof the demand was met by imports, which ware still being received at the rate of about 4 million tons a year.     As the time approached for giving effect to the ordinancepassed in July last whereby German steel manufacturers were to revert to the eight-hour day on 1st January, the situationover there was becoming rather acute.  It was reported that theGerman trade unions were demanding that their rates of pay should be increased, to compensate for reduced earnings underthe shorter working day.  Employers stated that the increased costs due to the shorter working day would amount to as muchas 10/- per ton of Ingots, while if the demand for increasedpay was persisted in, this would add another 4/6d to the cost,making In all 14/6d per ton.   The employers were pointing outthat an Increase of this magnitude would keep Germany out of
                                                                1 * Q%IRON AND STEEL (GONTD.).the export market and re-act to the disadvantage of thefinancial situation in Germany.  They characterised thedemand as quite impossible; and, in order to hasten asettlement on more moderate lines, they have given noticeboth to tho Government and to the workmen&apos;s organisationsthat they would close all their works on December 31st.  Itwas not thought likely that these extreme measures would beresorted to but there was every probability that the settle-ment would involve oome measure of increased costs.  Increasedcoats in Germany would re-act on world prices, but the  .result for Groat 3ritain was not likely to prove so favourableas might be expected, since the competition from France,Belgium and Luxemburg was much more severe than that fromGermany,     In South &apos;7ales the sheet trade was still suffering fromthe setback which Mr. 3ond referred to last month.  This was largely due to financial troubles in India among the people who bought sheets.  There was a marked improvement in thetinplate industry, which was now working at 76$ of capacity.The industry had come to an arrangement for an agreed restric-&quot;tion of output of 25$; and this had given confidence to themarket, and considerable business was being placed for many months ahead. This would naturally re-aot favourably on the&quot;Yelsh steel makers.     MR. PUGH wrote:-     &quot;There was a small increase of 5,000 tons in pig-ironproduction in the first month of the current quarter, asoompared with the output of September, thus: - October, 596,300tons; September, 591,500 tons, but of steel ingots and castingsthere was a decrease of 78,000 tons, October production being699,000 tons against 777,000 tons in September.  In the tinplateindustry, returns made to the ministry of Labour show that therewere 346 mills in operation at the end of October compared with289 at the end of September, at the -7orks from which returnswere received.     &quot;These changes in the volume of production have been reflected in the percentages of unemployment relating to the branches of the trade affected.  In the pig-iron industry thepercentage unemployed fell from 15.5$ to 13.3$; in the heavysteel trade it rose from 17.7$ to 20-3$, and in the tinplateindustry there was a fall from 32.8$ to 25.7$.  Although thesefigures register a reduction in the percentage of unemployment the average is still maintained at a very high figure, in spiteof the fact that in the heavy steel trade - where the averagepercentage of unemployment is the highest - the production ofsteel is higher than in any pre-war or post-war year, being at the rate of 780,000 tons per month.  In addition, a comparison between the number of insured workers in the heavy iron andsteel industry in July, 1927, with those In July, 1923, shows adecrease of 16,440, or inoluding the  pig-iron industry, 20,420.     &quot;Comparison between the iron and steel exports of theprincipal exporting countries in 1913, and for the first nine months of the present year shows that the percentage relation of the exports of the various countries-has undergone considerablealteration, that of Great Britain having fallen from 30.3$ ofthe total In 1913 to only 19.9$ In the ourrent year.

STSEL.     SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR wrote     &quot;Since the last meeting of the Advisory Council,there has been a decided slacking off in trade, no doubtdue to the desire to reduce stocks for stocktaking onDecember 31st; also with a view to conserving cashresources for Balance Sheets on that date.  This tendencyhas commenced rather earlier than usual.  There Is a strong feeling there is a good deal of business in the background,and that as soon aa the year opens, orders will be placed.     &quot;The rolling mills and forges in Sheffield are decidedlyshort of work.  In the engineers1 tool trade, files and sawsare decidedly slow, but there Is a good demand for highspeed steel drills and milling cutters.     &quot;Overseas trade has changed very little, but there is rather less coming forward from China.   Sheffield has been successful in regaining a considerable amount of trade inhigh class steel in Germany which it is confidently hopedwill be maintained.&quot;NON-FliRROUS HSTALS.     SIR C. BUDD observed that he was glad to be able toreport for the first time in several months that there tias alittle more movement in the non-ferrous metals industry.It was patchy, and did not amount to anything to boast about,but still it  was noticeable.  The competition, particularly from copper manufacturers in Germany, had eased very considerably, and seemed not to be  very much felt now.  Thecopper trade, no doubt, was as good  as one would expectit to be in the circumstances.  There was room for a greatdeal of improvement, however, and probably none of the works were nearly fully occupied.  Tin plates, as Mr. Bond had reported (see section on Iron and Steel) were a bright %spot.  Galvanised iron was very moderate.  The lead trades,particularly the cable industry, were well maintained.  TheIncreased consumption of lead on the Continent, which was reported by Lord Gainford on behalf of the Federation ofBritish Industries (see section on General Trade), had been due not to any increase in the manufacturing countries, butto large -purchases which had been made by Russia.  Thebusiness was all done, as far as was known, through Berlin.     On the whole, there seemed certainly to be a more hopeful outlook at the present time, and the barometer wastending to rise.jSNGINS-iiRING.     MR RICHMOND observed that the engineering positionshowed very little change from that outlined irihis report lastmonth to the Council.  The shipbuilding returns from the
ENGINEERING (CONTD.)Clyde district in November were again very satisfactory.There were launched during that month 26 vessels of about74,119 tons, and that  was a favourable figure as comparedwith those of the corresponding months in the last fewyears.     New contracts which were placed during the month hadbeen fairly satisfactory in number, although the tonnagewas not quite equivalent to the month&apos;s output.  One ofthe most important orders was one for 6 vessels of 10,000tons dead-velght each;  four orders were placed on thenorth-east coast and one on the Clyde.  An interestingpoint about these contracts was that they were for turbine-driven steam vessels whioh were understood to have been designed to compare as regards economy with motor-drivenvessels of a similar cargo capacity.  They were not high-pressure steam vessels; but there were, nevertheless, someinteresting developments of the latter kind coming on, whichit was believed ?/ould give a good deal of work; andaltogether one might look forward to the industry beingfairly well employed for some months ahead yet.     The enquiries coming forward at the moment indicated that there was a considerable amount of both mercantileand naval work in prospect.  The naval work was of the somewhat lighter character, but in the mercantile departmenttwo very large orders were anticipated, one for the &apos;*ThiteStar and the other for the Cunard Line.  If the navalcontracts were not delayed too long the industry would beable to maintain their position, if not improve it, in theearly part of next year.  On the north-east coast, however,the slow improvement had not quite been maintained, and theoutlook there was not quite so encouraging.     In engineering generally, there was a fair measure of activity all over the country, and the orders which had beenplaced by the railway companies were certainly having their effect on the unemployment figures.  In the machine tooltrade a number of specialist firms and those firms which made the lighter class of machine tool for, say, the motor industry, were fairly active, but the heavy machine tooltrade was still very slack and very dull indeed.  The exporttrade in this department was not quite so good, either in value or in weight, as in 1925 or 1926, while the imports were distinctly higher.  Boiler makers in the Midlands werereporting rather poor business, and constructionalengineering was rather patchy as regards employment.  However,the v/est of Scotland had been fortunate in securing a largecontract for work in Nigeria.     In locomotive engineering iianchester was rather betteroff than districts further north^here there was a considerabledearth of orders.  The Government railways of South Africahad a very large tender for locomotives out at present.The locomotives that had been ordered last were made inGermany and America, so that the competition from both ofthose countries was expected to be very great.  In textilemachinery Improvement was reported at Bradford and elsewhere,.but rather a set-baok at Oldham.  Altogether, there were nodecided changes in any seotion of the industry since thedate of the last meeting of the Council, but on the wholeit would probably not be inaccurate to say that thesituation was rather hopeful.
MOTOR CAR MANUFACTURE.     SIR JOHN THORNYCROFT said that after studying the reportof the delegation from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and traders to Australia and New Zealand, and discussing matters arising out of it with them, he thought it was quite clearthat they had found considerable criticism directed to thepowers of the engines fitted in British cars, v/hich had resulted from the methods of taxation in this country.It was interesting to note that the tendency was not toreduce but to increase the 3ize of the engines in all the products of the General Motors Organisation.  It was important to avoid anything of a similar nature taking place in regardto the design of British commercial vehicles, and we did not want our rivals to be able to say that these vehicles hadbeen designed to comply with special conditions necessitated by the home market and were, therefore, unsuitable for overseas conditions.  To avoid this, steps  should be takento re-grade the taxation so that it did not advance by thepresent large steps; in other words, the steps should bereduced to not more than 5 owts., which would then leavethe designer free to produce vehicles with suitable power for certain loads.     Referring to the heavy vehicle motor Show which had justtaken place, the Press generally had taken the line that thecommercial motor industry was in a very flourishing condition.A number of firms were, no doubt, doing quite well, but a false impression might be obtained from a casual inspection of the exhibits, as some of them showed a particular modelof which over 1,000,000 had been made in America and, on other stands which perhaps looked more imposing, wereexhibited models of which only 100 or less had been made. Inthis connection the trade returns of imports were unsatisfactoryin not differentiating between commercial vehicles and touringcar chassis.  It was understood that a distinction would.bemade in the next returns of exports, but it was very desirablethat the imports should be clearly differentiated as well.     THE PRESIDENT observed that in the returns of carsexported from this country the Customs were going to make the desired differentiation, because they were able to obtain adeclaration from the exporter as to the kind of car forwhich the chassis was intended by the maker.  It was notpossible to rely on getting a similar declaration as to theintention of the maker in the case of imported chassis.  Manychassis were, of course,suitable either for a commercialvehicle or for a touring car.     SIR JOHN THORNYCROFT, continuing, said that, while mostof the motor vehicle firms in this country were loing fairlywell, few of them were making large enotigh profits to allow of their embarking on any considerable effort to get overseastrade like their American rivals, and there were a number ofimportant firms whose profits would go to paying off theirindebtedness to the Banks for some time to come.  The manu-facture of motor vehicles was now such an important part ofthe engineering industry, and was coupled up with so many others., that it must be disastrous if the country did not get its full share of foreign orders.
                                       1 1 9MOTOR  CAR  MANUFACTURE. (CONTD.)     MR. HURCOMB referred to some of the points Sir JohnThornycroft had raised.  He did not discuss the questionsof the horse power rating and the steps in the taxation sc^leof the commercial vehicle,which, he said, were not new,butexplained that the Ministry of Transport had for a long time been asked by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Tradersand others interested to give some information as to thenumber of new registrations of motor vehicles.  those interested in the Motor Trade wanted to see what new motor vehicles in the different classes were being registered inthe different areas of the country, as distinct from theregistrations which merely represented renewals.  TheMinistry had recently issued a return which Sir John had nodoubt seen, giving that information in a good deal of detail, &apos;and the issue would be made quarterly.  It was hoped thatthey had thus gone some way to meet the demand for betterinformation though the return did not touch the question ofthe make of cars at all,and could not very well do so.COTTON.     SIR KENNETH STEWART observed that Lancashire dependedfor about eighty per cent, of her trade on export markets andfor about twenty per cent, on home markets, so the export market was. the more important.  The particular countrieswhich were affecting our trade chiefly at the moment were,first of all, China.  Exports of cotton piece-goods to Chinafor the first ten months of this year amounted to about 3^ millions, as against about  6^- millions for the same ten months of last year.  There were no apparent signs ofimprovement except the usual seasonal demand for Springgoods which was taking place on a very small scale.  Themarket was not absolutely dead, but was not very far from it.  A more serious feature for our trade was the reductionof the Japanese exports of Cotton piece-goods to China from about  11,000,000 for the first seven months of. last year toabout  6,000,000 during the first seven months of this year.The consequence of this was the intensified japanese competition in our other markets.  It might be that japan was losing money in increasing her exports to these othermarkets, but that did not make the position better forLancashire.  In September 1927, for example, Japan hadexported 19,551 packages of cotton goods into Calcutta asagainst 10,209 packages in 1926.  Other markets were alsofeeling the effects of her more stringent competition.     In India there was at the moment a great improvementin enquiry.  This was now normal for.the time of year.  Duringthe last two years it had been from November to March that most of the business for the market had been carried through.This period had usually been followed by a considerablere-action.  Other eastern.markets were showing signs ofinterest, and on the whole business appeared to be more aotivethan recently.  From the producers1 point of view matters were not improving.   Prices were being accepted which showedas bad results as had ever been seen.  The attemptedarrangements by the American yarn sections appeared to have
COTTON  (CONTD.)broken down.  External as well as internal competitionseemed to be foroing prices below levels which wereremunerative for the producers.  Most of the other marketswere showing very much the same type of trade as they had done in the earlier part of the year.     Our difficulties in lancashire were felt in threeprincipal ways:-     (1) Where there was looal production of goods abroad,protective duties were almost invariably put up against our imports to the point which enabled local mills to pay,irrespective of their comparative efficiency.  This type of competition was one we oould hardly meet.     (2) We had competition from other countries.  Our chiefdifficulty in this respect lay in the fact that the manu-facture of cotton piece goods entailed so large a proportionof manual labour, compared to most other manufactures.  Inthe bulk lines one might say that most of it was manual labour that did not require skill beyond the capacity of our competitors.  To exhibit the proportion of manual labour required in piece goods, mention might be made of a recently published dooument by Mr. John H. Grey of Messrs. John Greyand Company, who were very large weavers, who gave, - ashis results for the year from July 1st, 1924, to June 30th,1925, - the cost of weaving as 6/lld. per 100 yards for hismill, of whioh about 5/3-gd. represented wages and salaries,and the balance, l/7-jgd. represented all other costs,inoluding full depreciation and interest on capital.  In amanufacturing trade which used so large a proportion oflabour, the oountry which could get its labour cheaper and use It for longer hours had a great advantage.     (3) The third difficulty which confronted the trade wasthat the greatest users of our goods, the Eastern marketsgenerally, depended so entirely upon price.  Their purchaseswere pretty well in proportion to the prices they had to pay.A reference might be made here to what Mr. Lindsay had said(see section on Indian Trade) namely, that the amount of ourgoods going to India had been steadily increasing.  So hadthe price of our goods been steadily coming down during thelast three years.  As regards bleached goods exported toIndia,-a trade in whioh we had always had almost a monopoly, -in 1913 our exports had been 732,139,000 yards, valued at 8^ millions; in 1926 they wore 495,000,000 yards, ascompared with  732,000,000 yards, and were valued at  9fmillion as compared to  Sj million.  That was equivalent toabout 2fd. per yard in 1913 and 4fd. in 1926, a difference of 2d. per yard.  Of this difference about fd. a yard mightbe asoribed to the enhanced price of cotton, and the balanoe,lid.a yard, to the rise in manufacturing costs.  Then againMr. Grey showed in his figures that weaving costs in 1913were 3/7d. per 100 yards as against 6/lld. per 100 yardsto-day.     The financial disorganisation of the industry inmany of its aspects was of no assistance in getting these
CONFIDENTIAL.COTTON  (CONTD.).matters put right, as might well be imagined, added towhich a steady fall in the price of the raw material from december 1923 to December 1926 had caused losses to somebodyconcerned in the industry on every transaction, and had notencouraged new oapital to take a hand in the industry.  these problems were receiving very particular attention inManchester and in time it was hoped that some usefulprogress would be made.WOOL.     MR. AYKROYD stated that employment with wool combers waspoor; they were not working to full capacity, indeed,  themajority of them were very quiet.  This, however, was  the timeof year when stocks were always fairly low, and it was estimated that at least 30/6 to 35?2 of the combs were standing.The spinners as a whole were fairly well employed, and the firms engaged on export to Germany would have probably abouta couple of months of work in hand.  The position with them was fairly good.  The coloured spinners were slightly  better,however, and were mostly well employed.  The hosiery brancheswere not busy.     In weaving there was not much change to report.  Thecoating trade, the Huddersfield trade, which was in general a very high class trade mainly confined to that district, wasin a moderately favourable condition, but the dress tradewas very bad.  The woollen trade remained badly off, with notvery much prospect.  As far as could be seen, it was somewhataffected by the lack of raw material.  It wss stated thatprior to the war large supplies of regs used to come fromRussia which were not forthcoming to-day, and of course thatwould be affecting the industry on account of its having to buy much dearer raw materials to run the machines.  Marketsas a whole were quieter than a fortnight ago, and the seasonal orders usually placed at this time of the year weredisappointing.  Owing to the dear basis of raw material itwas Bomewhat doubtful whether the improved prospect whichwe had a month ago would be maintained.     COLONEL WILLEY desired to make some observations aboutthe increaeed activity of Germany in the wool textile trade.If the figures were examined, this would be seen to be largely the result of exports of yarns to that country.   Thefigures of our exports of worsted yarns for the first ten months of the -present year showed rn increase of from 25million lbs to 37 million lbs. or practically a fiftyper cent increase over the corresponding fifureB for lastyear.  Most of these experts would be found to be going
WOOL (OONTD.).to Germany.  Colonel V/illey had got back that morning from another tour on the Continent.  He had found that if oneconsidered the countries surrounding Germany - i.e. Franoe,Austria, Czecho-Slovakia and Poland, they would be seen alllargely to be occupied in the same way as we were, that Is,in exporting to Germany.  It was, therefore, very obviousthat the activity of this industry depended on the continuedprosperity of Germany.  If any lessening of this shouldooour it would re-aot very materially on this country inthis particular industry.  If domestic consumption inGermany was able to Bustain this large import, and could doso even when the reparation payments next became due therewould, as a result, be a great incentive to export fromGermany, and the full effect of German competition had not,therefore, yet been felt.     As regards the termination of the wage agreement in the woollen Industry of this country as from the end of lastmonth, there was a good deal of difference of opinion amongemployers as to the best line to take, but the preponderatingopinion was that there should be no attack on the payenvelopes, but rather some re-distribution of the total wagecost by re-adjusting the remuneration for the less skilledsections of the trade which had been maintained at a high level compared with that obtaining before the war, and thepayment made to the better skilled workers.     Going round the Continent one was Impressed by the faotthat this oountry stood at an increasing disadvantage byreason of trade union practices and factory legislation which were much more exacting here than in the countriescompeting with us in the world&apos;s trade, particularly as Inother countries account was taken of the facts that the woollen industry was seasonal and subject to the vagaries offashion.  Other countries did not conform to the rigidpractice which we had here.     The trade was Improving a bit in this country,  A letterhad been received which said, &quot;improvement in trade has madea great demand for weavers,&quot;  Already there was a serious shortage of this olass of operatives, and many who had previously been weavers and were prepared to return found it impossible to weave the class of materials which the traderequired today.  We were, accordingly, likely to suffer fromthe fact that there had been virtually no apprenticestaken Into this Industry, on account of its stagnation; sothat if trade came back, while we had the equipment, we hadnot the skilled personnel.     MR. ARTHUR SHAW observed that, as was well known,  theposition in the wool trade was very unsteady at the moment,though perhaps not quite so strained within the last ten ortwelve days as it had been previously.  The atmosphereitself was unreal; on both sides there was a feeling ofinsecurity which was not helpful to the industry.   TheIndustrial Council was still functioning, and so recently as last Friday the Emergenoy Oommittee had met to considerapplications for overtime, had renewed permits, and had also given new permits for overtime whioh inoluded thirty-five of the manufacturers and thirty-two of the spinners.CONFIDENTIAL.
WOOL (CONTD.)     Tho unemployment figures were very similar to Tiiatthey had been&quot;last month.  Mr. Shaw did not quite agreewith what Mr. Aykroyd had said as to the dress trade inthe Bradford district being exceedingly bad.  The number of work people in that district signing the Vacant Book on30th November was slightly higher than the number at theend of October, but it only represented 6.35 of the full membership.  The position in the heavy woollen districthad gradually been becoming worse since the 26th October,and the unemployment returns showed an increase every week,the final figure for the 30th November representing 20.82$of the membership.   In the Halifax and Hudder-sflolddistrict trade had been maintained, and the figures showed a slight improvement.  The percentage of unemployment haddecreased during the month from 8.21$ to 7.03$.  Theunemployment figures for the whole of the West Riding were now 10.61$ of the full membership.     The report which had appeared in the Ministry ofLabour Gasette for November showing the changes betweenJuly 1925 and July 1927 in the estimated numbers of insuredpersons In certain Industries, had promoted a widediscussion relative to the wool textile figures, which indicated a decrease of over 20,000 operatives between those dates.  There did not appear to be any reason to doubt the figures as between 1924 and 1927, provided therehad be en no re-classification in the Ministry&apos;s recordswithin that period.  But as between 1925 and 1924 areduction had been shown of 8,000 operatives in theindustry, and during that period there appeared to havebeen a re-classification.  Before we could attach importance to the figures in the Gazette, however, we oughtto know quite definitely whether the r e-classificationduring the period between July 1923 and July 1934 affectedthese particular workers.  Mr. Shaw handed in a statement(given at the end of this note of his remarks) whichmight be of Interest to the Council,  By way of summarisingit he would say that from 1923 to 192 4 there had been arecorded increase in the dyeing and finishing section of nearly 6,000 operatives,  Mr. Shaw was satisfied, however,that in fact there had not been an increase in the numberof operatives in the dyeing section.  He assumed that largenumbers who had been recorded as being in the wool  textile industry in 1925 actually ought to have been recorded asbeing in other industries and were subsequently transferredto the categories of those industries.  Certainly in onedistrict alone during that period there had been a recordeddecrease of 6,000 in the wool textiles and a recordedincrease of the operatives in other branches of the textiletrades amounting to over 5,000.   Accordingly  he suggestedthat the Ministry&apos;s figures required very careful examination.  In addition, the trade in 1934 had been much better than in 1923j  the figures even for exports roseconsiderably during that time, and it would, therefore,appear that the number of operatives in 1924 had been equalto that in 1925.  He proposed also to hand in two statements(given at the end of this note) with regard to the census of production, because here again the figuresquoted  in the  census  and repeated in the -Pressshowed  that from  1912 to 1924 there had been a reduction
CONFIDENTIAL.WOOL. (CONTD).i53of over 3,000 operatives.   Thia figure paid no regard to the half-timers who were employed in 1912, easily 10,000 in number and therefore, these hav5.ng been replaced by full-timers by1924, the 1S12 figures appeared to show a larger number ofemployed workpeople than the 1924 figures did.  There was alsoa further very important point with regard to the census ofproduction.  Analysing the figures of 1907, the percentage ofwoollens shown to have b?jen expected was 45.1 of productionand of worsteds 47c4; tho total export was 46*3.  In the 1924census the total exports had increased to 51.6 of production,but thera had been a remarkable change in the increase; the exports of woollens had gone up to 64$ and worsteds had dropped down to 33$.  Here again the figures would be used togive an indication that the worsted trade had gone down veryvery badly; but if the figures wore examined closely.. Itwould be found that In the census figures under the head of&quot;Woollens&quot; there wa3 Included a production of 27 million square yard3 of woollens under eight ounces to the squareyard, and an export of 60 million square yards of suchwoollens.  It seemed to be obvious that the manufacturershad classified these as woollens for the monthly returns of the Export trade and as worsteds for the purpose of the census of production figures; and until this classificationoould be made more accurate, the figures- were very misleadingindeede  The census figures naturally showed the exports ofthe Bradford trade, the worsted trade, in a deplorablecondition.     THE PRESIDENT said It was Important to get from thetrade figures of production which were framed on a consistentbasis and were accurate.  The points which Mr.  Shaw had raised would be carefully inquired into.          First Statement handed in by Mr. Arthur Shaw.     The following table appears In the &quot;Ministry of LabourGazette&quot; for November 1927:-                         Textiles.

OOSFDStfriAL.WOOL (OONTP.).   First Statement handed In by Mr.. Arthur Shaw (oontd.).     I am satisfied there was no inorease in the number employed in the Bleaohing and Dyeing for the same period.Indeed, from our own records  of Trade Union membership, thenumber of operatives appears to have decreased.     In one Textile centre, the number of operatives in WoolTextiles decreased by 6,000 and in the same district, theclassified operatives in other branches of the textile tradeincreased by over 3,000.      Seoond Statement handed in by Mr. Arthur Shaw.     The publication of the 1924 Census gives the totalnumber cf operatives in Wool Textiles at 275,926, but this includes 14,441 on the managerial, olerioal and teohnicalside.  The balance, 261,485, includes juveniles under 16years of age, but a large percentage of the clerical staff will be insured persons and included in the Ministry ofLabour tables. .     The Oensus figures show a decrease from 1912 to 1924of 3,037, but during that period  there has been a remarkablechange in the number of operatives employed over 18 years ofags&apos;.   The number of employed persons over 18 has increased-by                                                      15,469 J.    *     &quot;    &quot;     &quot;      n     under B  &quot;  decreased by                                                      18,526.     In the 1912 Census there wag&apos; a large number of half-timers, and on a low estimate this could be put down at10,000.  In comparing the 1912 figures with the 1924 figures,5,000 can be deducted owing to the half-timers being replaced by persons over 14 years of age employed as full-timers.Third Statement handed in by Mr. Arthur Shaw.     It is now possible to compare the production of 1924with the Census fig-ires of 1907.  The production of 1907 febased upon linear yards, and therefore allowance must bemade for conversion into square yards.  There is a difference of opinion in the trade as to the figure to be applied, butI have used the Board of Trade formula of 4 square yards to3 linear yards for woollens, and 5 square yards to 4 linearyards for worsteds^1907.WoollensExports. 45.1Worsteds26112447.451223746.3
1r* p*     It will be observed that whilst the percentage exports have increased from 46.3 to 51.6, there is a remarkablechange in the exports of woollens and worsteds,  examinationof the figures, however, indicates that the classification of woollens and worsteds that are made for the returns forthe monthly figures published in the Accounts relating toTrade and Navigation widely differ from those given in the returns for the Census of Production.     I propose to hand in tables for the classification under each section, and it will be observed that the discrepancyoccurs in the schedule for the woollens under 8 os. to the square yard.  The actual figure recorded for production is26,997,000 and the exports under this heading amount to60,006,500 square yards.  There is no similar classificationunder -worsteds, but the production of tissues under 12 ozto the square yard amounts to 115,866,000, and the exportsto 42,946,600 sq. yds.     From these figures it would appear that the persons responsible for making out the returns have either(a) included in the monthly returns as exports for the woollen section, tissues that have been included in the census of Production under the heading of worsteds; or (b)included under the heading of worsteds, tissues which shouldhave been classified as woollens.     This extraordinary classification is sure to lead toconfusion, ana outside authorities comparing figures willhave the utmost difficulty in attaching to them theimportance which should be given to the publication of the census.\Table                  WOOL (CONTD.).Third Statement handed in by Mr. Arthur Sha?.&apos; (Contd.)-                         1924.               iroductjons.

MR. ADDISON stated that he was still able to report asatisfactory state of affairs.  Without exception all thevarious manufacturing centres in this country, such as Leith,Oongloton and ^aoclesfield, were busy.  In the hosiery trade at Leicester there was usually a slight falling off in thedemand at this time of the year, but to-day the demand seemedbiggor than ever.  The same remark applied to the lace-making trade.  As regards the big weaving centres of lancashire -and Yorkshire, it might interest the Council toknow that manufacturers were buying well into next year; it looked therefore as though thoy were anticipating a goodamount of business.  In fact, production in the country was inadequate to the demandj and, that being so, the exporttrade, exoopt for specialities, did not weigh very muohwith the manufacturer in this oountry.
RUBBER.     MR. JOHNSTON wrote     &quot;The general position of the rubber industry continuesto be fairly satisfactory.   The tyre section at the moment is somewhat disorganised owing to the action of a Frenchconcern, who are in process of installing a factory in thiscountry, and who have made a considerable reduction In prices which is quite unjustified by the co3t position.   this action is apparently taken in the hope of increasing turnoverby the time the British factory is in operation, and is likelyto have an unfortunate effect on the results of the Britishtyre concerns who have all met the move by more or lesssimilar reductions.   This section of the industry continuesfairly active for the season of the year.     &quot;The rubber footwear branch of the industry is in a very satisfactory situation, and considerably increased demand isbeing created by a co-opex^ative advertising compaign.   Inthis branch, although competition from abroad is keen, foreign competitors show themselves very reasonable on the pricequestion and do not, generally speaking, attempt to cutselling prices.   As regards the general rubber trade,including mechanical rubber goods supplied to industrial concerns, the position remains on the whole fairly satis-factory and the activity in this branch suggests that, apartfrom the heavy industries, the country1s trade as a whole isslowly recovering.     &quot;Employment in the industry continues to be good, and onthe v/hole the situation may be regarded as fairly satisfactory&quot;.FOOD INDUSTRIES.     SIR STANLEY MACEIN observed that this was a season when a fair trade WSLS always looked for, and this year it appearedto be rather better than it had been at the correspondingperiod of last year.   But, although the orders received were very numerous, buying had been unusually delayed this year,and there was now a rush of demands from the retail distri-butor which was greater than usual and which it was difficult for the manufacturer to meet.   The rush had come about nowthrough buyers failing to lay in sufficient stocks to meetthe retail demand, and the orders, although numerous, had beenbeen much smaller than usual.   Buyers had got into the habit of buying from hand to mouth of necessity during the war, andit still continued.   Last year it was due in particular tothe coal dispute when buyers would do nothing until they were driven; and this year, although it was not quite so marked,the same thing existed.   Nevertheless, results would probablyshow that this season&apos;s trade would be rather better than itwas last year.     So far as export was concerned, this was a slack seasonof the year, but that referred particularly to Continentalfcr&amp;de.  Food exports to the Continent had almost closed down...In one or two markets we were beginning to compete, but hereone came up against the trade barrier question.   While one
CONFIDENTIAL.FOOD INDUSTRIES. (CONTD.)saw an ostensible demand for the reduction of trade barriers and an appreciation of the difficulties andhindrances they created, barriers were, nevertheless,being increased against us and not reduced.     India was perhaps, from the food point of view, thebrightest spot in our export trade.   Yte were now openingorders on our boolcs for India for next year, and that was almost a new and a very hopeful experience.GENERAL TRADE.   LORD GAINFORD stated that the general report of theFederation of British Industries indicated normal seasonaltendencies and re-adjustments.   The general trend,according to that report, continued in the direction offirmness and more active business.   The large volume ofnew foreign issues augured well for the future of our export trade, and the increased liquidity of banking funds for that of business development generally.     In regard to coal, the demand for South America had improved, largely owing to a fall in freights, and a slightImprovement was reported in the export trade to Italy.  Iniron and steel a more optimistic tone prevailed throughoutthe market.   There was now a tendency for hematite prices to be steadier, but price-cutting continued.   The demandfor copper had been moderate, while business with theContinent in special types had been fair.   The tin markethad undergone a heavy 3et back.   There had been an improveddemand for lead, especially from the Continent.   The con-sumption of spelter had increased to a great extent inGermany.   Galvanisers appeared to be purchasing on a smaller scale, but the market had been steady.     A general strengthening of the raw wool position, withkeen buying on foreign account, was an indication that supplies were urgently needed.   The American cotton markethad shown a sagging tendency during November.   This hadre-acted on the Egyptian section but to a much smaller extent.Trade in boots and shoes continued to be satisfactory, bothon home and foreign account.   Cutlery manufacturers were notvery well placed so far as home trade was concerned, buttrade with foreign and Empire markets was being maintained.The pottery industry appeared to have slackened somewhat.Little change was reported in chemicals.   In lace andhosiery, business on&quot;home account had been fairly 3atis-factory, but poor on foreign account.
1r* AiiiOOHPIIBtyPlAL.GENERAL TR&amp;DIAI (CONTD.).     The shipbuilding industry had maintained its positionduring November, and further small orders had been placed.The machine tool section continued depressed, and the textilemachinery quiet.  Electrical firms continued to be wellemployed,  -rroduotion at some of the leading motor carfactories was being steadily developed, while cycle manufac-turers were also increasing their outputs.     MR. VYLE said that the improvement in trade which he had reported at the last meeting of the Council appeared to have continued, but if we were to ask, &quot;Are we satisfied with thebusiness we are having today?1&apos;, the answer would no doubt bea definite negative.  There was room for more orders on ourbooks, and generally for a greater activity.  There was a seasonal activity just now, but that was passing off, and inmany trades, from now until Christmas not much would be done.That was reflected in the increase in the number of un-employed.  Some of the trades, however, were still continuing to be moderately busy.      SIR STANLEY MACHIN&apos;3  information confirmed very oloselywhat  Mr. Vyle had said.  No doubt things generally were rather better, but he could not see - and those with whom hewas in contact could not see - where there was any real sign of a  return to that position which all were longing for.There was hesitation and doubt, and while at present theoutlook was rather better, we could not really look forward tothe future with any great  deal of satisfaction.               Co-operative V/wholesale Society.      MR. HAYEURST wrote as follows:-      &quot;Grocery and Irovisions.  I am again in the very happyposition of being able to  report that the sales during thepast  month (November) have been of a highly satisfactorycharaoter in almost every  section, noteworthy increases beingrecorded over the corresponding period of last year.      &quot;Butter.

Arrivals wereclearing steadily during the last week.  However, the highercounter price had the effect of reducing consumption slightly,with  the result that the market turned slow, with an outlook for reduced figures.  Germany, who in 1913 took only aninfinitesimal quantity, are now clearing probably one thirdof the total produotion of Denmark.      &quot;Cheese&quot;.

Heavy sules have been effected, several of the home-&amp;rown  beet factories beins&apos;  over-sold,  i-rices of the latter have eased  slightly durin&amp; the past  week. Foreign supplies at the moment are on the scarce side.     &quot;Wheat.  On the month the market is from 6d.  to  ls.Od. higher in price.   The  outstanding feature is that  there is estimated to he a  much larger quantity  available in exporting countries than  importing,  countries are  expected to require. Smaller quantities of  Canadian than  usual have been shipped, and navigation will close very shortly.   Complaints respecting the new Australian crop have ceased, and there seems  every likelihood of the  yield being much larger than originally estimated.  Higher prices have been  asked for Russian;  and it is stated that the gluten from Russian  wheat has less stability than  that from  Canadian.   To  substitute  Canadian with Russian causes a  smaller yield  in  bread, resulting in complaints from bakeries.  Generally, the world outlook is that the recent advances  in prices will be of a temporary character only.     &quot;Drapery, Boots,  Furnishing: and furniture.  Sales throughout the month in every department have been very good, satisfactory increases being recorded in practically  every section.     &quot;Tea.  The markets for the month show a lesser average oost.  This, however,  is misleading, because actually the cost has hardened,  What  has happened during  the  past few weeks has been a bigger  precenta^e of lover quality teas at the auctions.  The shortage of tea in Northern India previously reported is expected to be over 20 million lbs.,  and  to aggravate this there continues the increasing demand from all parts of the world  for tea.   These two  facts combined leave no possibility of  a  big drop in the  price  position.     &quot;Coffee.  Only  export types have been ooming forward, the relative small quantities of other coffees which have been catalogued Yvere Colombians and ICenyans,  both of which commanded high prices.  The auctions during the coming v/eekswill, however,  be heavy for home coffees,  and competition promises to be keen.     &quot;Cocoa.  The  prices have been averaging round 64/- West Coast,  which means  72/- London.   In comparison with these figures for crops,  quotations  have been made on  the Liverpool and Londonmarkets at 54/- f.o.b. future shipments.

HOLLAND MARTIN thought that, speaking generally, inthe North one found that, except in the purely coal districts and certain of the cotton areas, the general tendency washopeful, but it was tempered with the feeling that progress was very, very slow.  The chief feature in London had beenthe very large number of new issues and the firmness of the dollar exchange.  Today, as would have been Been, there wasa report that  a small import of gold was taking place.Whether it would continue or not, could not be foretold.     MR. CURRIE reported that the rate for money had been well maintained during the month.  It became easier aboutDecember 1st owing to the distribution of War Loan dividends,but there appeared to be no likelihood of it remaining at a low level.  The dollar exchange had boen till moreaccentuated by the shipment of gold to this country that morning.  On the Stock Exchange there had been a considerablenumber of new issues, which appeared to have bean successfullyabsorbed.     SIR W.H. GOSCHEN remarked that he had listened with interest to the  various reports that had been made, whichwere of particular interest to him as a member of afinance house.   He would be ready to contributo reports atsubsequent meetings, describing the oommeroial and financial situation as It presented Itself to him.
CONFIDENTIAL.SHIPPING.     MR. ALEXANDER SHAW observed that the index number ofshipping freights for October was 27.34, as compared with43.12for the same month last year; it was slightly higherthan it had been in September, 1927.  The tonnage laid up at the principal ports of Great Britain and Ireland onOotober 1st had been 272,839 net tons, as against 371,057 tonson October 1st, 1923.  The weight of coal exports during october, 1927, viz. 4,141,000 ton,  was slightly lower than during October 1925 (for October 1926 there was no comparisonon account of the strike) and it was also less than the exports of September, 1927, the previous month.  One strikingfigure among thooe which the Chamber of Shipping  had got outwas that for the price of speoial bunkers f.o.b. Newcastle,-which had been 15/3 for September last.  This figure had continued in October also, and it compared with the price in January this year of 17/3d.  In the two subsequent monthsit had been 17/6d., and in April 17/3d. again.  Then itstarted downwards to this very low figure of l5/3d.     There were only two other matters which Mr. Shaw proposedbriefly to mention.  The Washington Conference on Wirelesshad now completed its labours, and through the courtesy ofthe British Government the British shipowners (in addition to continental shipowners) had been able to be represented atWashington.  Although they did not get anything like all theyhad wanted, there was a very general feeling among them thatthey owed a great debt of gratitude to the British Board ofTrade for being allowed to put forward their views, and thecompromises that had been arrived at were regarded as satisfactory.  The American suggestion had been the instantabolition of spark transmission for all vessels.  That wouldhave cost British shipping about  2,000,000.  The solutionarrived at, however, was that no new vessels after next year were to be fitted with spark sets, except very smallemergency sets, and that by 1940 no vessel of any kind wouldbe fitted with spark apparatus.  That method would graduallydrop out.     The only other matter which had come very much to thefore during the last month with rather a spurt was the  use ofpulverised coal on board ship.  Many people who took themost pessimistic view about that a short time ago were becomingenthusiastic, and improvements in burners, so as to give acomparatively short flame, were encouraging people connectedwith shipping to fit it in the furnaces of their shoreinstallations to work the ordinary machinery of the yards, andto consider fitting it instead of oil to steamers.  One ofthe objections to it had been the dangerous nature of thedust, but now machinery was available by which the coal couldbe pulverised on board, so that to have large quantities ofcoal in this dangerous, pulverised condition was not necessary.  This matter seemed to be one of very greatimportance for the future not only of shipping but also ofthe coal industry.                        RAILWAY TRAFFIC.     MR. HURC0MB said that the general trend of the railwayposition remained as had been reported for some months past.
RAIL&quot;/AY TRAFFIC (OONTD.).The figures for the four amalgamated companies in respectof the forty seven weeks ending on the 27th November showedincreased receipts amounting to about four millions sterlingon the carriage of merchandise, and to about two millionssterling on the carriage of coal as compared with thecorresponding figures for 1925.  That increase was in excessof the percentage increase in the rates, so that it reflecteda real increase in the railway carryings, which was borne out also by the figures of tonnage for the first nine monthsof the year, which showed an increase.  On the other hand the passenjrer receipts showed a decrease of about fivemillions aa compared with 1925, so the net position left thecompanies about one million up.  It was necessary, however,to remember, a3 had been pointed out before, that a comparison with the passenger traffic in 1925 was not quite a fail&apos; one because of the special Wembley traffic in thatyear, and one had to make a substantial allowance for thatin judging the position.  But there had, no doubt, been afalling off in the volume of passenger traffic, and ahigh proportion of that traffic was being carried at reducedrates of one soi^t or another.  The Companies were nowcharging less than full fares on half the number of journeystaken by railway.EMPLOYMENT.     MR. PHILLIPS observed that during the month theunemployment figures had risen rather sharply, the total at28th November being 1,145,200, or 71,000 more than on24th October.  This was a disappointment after the previoustrend of the figures which had not shown any marked changefor the worse since the beginning of July.  The increase during the month had been spread over the whole country.Sach of the divisions in the country 3howed an increase,except Wales where there had been a decrease of 4,500.  Themost marked increase was in the London area and in theMidlands.     Mr. Phillips handed in the table (given at the end ofthi3 note of his remarks) asked for by the President at thelast meeting of tho Council showing for the insured tradesthe increases in the number of persons in employment inJuly 1927 over recent years back to 1921.  If July 1922and July 1927 were compared there would be seen to be anincrease of about 1,100,000 In the number of persons inemployment..  If 1924 was compared with 1027, - two years during -which the average of unemployment was about thesame, - there was an increase in the number in employment ofabout 478,000 and thi3 latter figure was almost exactly equalto the increase in the total number insured which was thusabsorbed without any change in the number unemployed.     Mr. Phillip8 also handed in a summary (given at the endof this note) of an article to which Mr. Shaw had referred(see section on Wool), appearing in the Ministry of LabourGazette.  That article attempted to give the changes in distribution of workpeople back to 1925, first as between one industry and another, showing which industry had grown and which industry had decreased, and then to 3ome extent asbetween one part of the country and another.

The &quot;differences&quot; in Column (4)probably show accuratelyenough, when compared with one another, the changes in thenumbers in employment in insured trades.  (The years 1921 and1926 should, of course, be disregarded owing to the coaldisputes).  Between 1922 and 1927 there was an increase of1,160,000 in the number in  employment, while between 1924and 1927 there was an increase of 478,000 (this latternumber being almost exactly equal to the increase in thetotal number insured, which was thus absorbed without anychange in the number unemployed).     Another calculation recently made shows that the numberof days worked by insured-persons (after making deductionsfor trade disputes and unemployment but not for sickness)was, for the six months April, to September of each year,1,580 million in 1924, 1,480 million in 1926 and 1,670million in 1927.     The data are not available for giving corresponding figures for the total occupied population.                      CONFIDENTIAL.

-CONFIDENTIAL.EMPLOYMENT (CONTD.).Summary handed In by Mr. Phillips.Changes on the estimated numbers of insured persons.               Industrial  and  geographical  analysis.     A detailed analysis of  the  industrial  and  geographioal changes  in  the estimated  numbers  of  persons  insured  under the  Unemployment  and  Insurance  Acts  appeared in  the  November issue of the  Ministry of  Labour Gazette  (pages 426 to 430). The  following is  a  brief  summary. Growth andDeoline  of  individual  industries.      A comparison of  the  number of insured persons classified as belonging  to individual  industries  at July of each year gives in the  majority of  cases  some  idea of  the rate of growth or decline.  (Improvements in machinery and In manufacturing processes might,  however, in some cases oause a temporary slackening in the numbers  employed concurrently with a real expansion in  the  industry).  Over the whole 100&apos; industry groups the new entrants to  insurance from July 1926, to June  1927,  represented 6-.S per contn of tho total numbers insured  at  July 1926,  the wastage through  deaths, emigration etc.  represented  5.9  per  cent,  and the not increase during the  year was,  therefore,  0.9 per cent.  These proportions vary considerably  in different industries. (a)  Crowing Industries.  For the purpose of this analysis the 100  Industry  groups were  compressed  to mako up 54 groups and  in 53 of  these there  was a  net increase in the numbers insured  between July 1926 and July 1927, while in 21 there was  a net decline.      The  most  notable  examples  of expansion were silk (including  artificial  silk); brick tile etc making,  the building trade; furniture and upholstery; the distributive trades;  road  transport) hosiery; motor vehicles; and electrical  engineering. (b) Recovering Industries.   Six Industries which showed decline&quot;  in  1925-26 Indicated expansion in 1926-27, namely:- iron  and  steel  manufacture  (inoluding pig Iron); the chemicals group; the  leather trades; tailoring; drink and eobacco; and tho  hotel  and boarding-house Industry. (c) Declining;  industries:- Eight industries showed an opposite  trend  viz:-   stove, grate and general ironfounding; electrical  wiring, cable,  lamp  etc manufacture; paper, cardboard box  and stationery; dress other than tailoring; bootB and shoea; ootton; pottery; and watches,  clocks, plate and jewellery.      Of  those which showed decline in 1926-27 as well as in1925-26  the most important wore:-  shipbuilding tand ship-repairing and marine engineering; general engineering;coal mining; woollen and worsted; the glass trades and canal,river,  dock and harbour service.

&quot;CONFIDENTIAL.           EMPLOYMENT (CONTD.).Summary handed in by Mr. Phillips (Contd.).      The  table  shows  that  in  the  expanding industries not only are  the  new  entrants  comparatively  large  in number bu&apos;u there is  a  tendency for the normal wastage through  deaths, etc.,  to  be offset by transfers  of workers from other industries. Four year Survey,  1923 to 1927.      For  the  most important industries the survey has been extended  back to  July,  1923,  when the revised  industrial classification  was introduced.  This shows broadly  the same trend  as that given above for the year 1926-27.  Thus the  silk  and  artificial silk  industry records  a growth  in the  four  year period  equal to 47.6 per cent, of the numbers  insured  at July 1923j  the building materials  industry  has a growth of 40.5  per cent the  building trade itself, with public works  contracting 20.5 per cent.;  electrical engineer- ing  30.1  per  cent.; the distributive trades 26.1 per cent.; motor vehicles  21.4 per cent.; Pottery has an  increase  of only 0.7  per  cent, and  the cotton textile  industry  0.4 per  cent.      On the other hand  coal mining shows a decline  in the four year period of 3.6 per cent.; coke ovens  and by product works 21.3  per  cent.;  pig  iron 13.8 per cent.;  steel manufacture 7.8 per cent.; shipbuilding 20 per cent.; marine engineering 12.8 per  cent.; general engineering 10.0 per cent,  and woollen and worsted 7.8 per cent. Coal mining.      For  the  purpose  of determining the extent  to which insured persons moved during  1928-27 from  coal  mining to other industries and  also  in  the  contrary  direction special steps were  taken to record such transfers  at the iixchange of unemployment  books in July 1927.      In the v/hole industry there was a net  decrease during the  year  in the numbers  insured of 26,570  persons.  The new  entrants  to insurance numbered 42,156  and  the net losses 68,726.  During  the year the records on  the unemploy- ment  books  exchanged  showed that 30,805 persons  transferred from coal mining to some other industry while 17,520 transferred from other  industries to coal mining.   There was thus  a net  transfer out  of the industry of 13,285 persons giving a gross wastage  of 86,246.     About  30 per cent,  of those who left coal mining for some  other insured industry transferred to the building trade and  public works contracting;  10 per cent, went to metal and metal  goods manufacture; 8 per cent,  to brick,  tile etc.making and 7 per cent, to transport and communication. 6.5 per oent.  went to engineering and 5 per oent. to mining other  than coal mining.     The changes in coal mining were not uniform in all  theareas.  In the Cumberland and  &quot;Westmorland, Yorkshire,Nottinghamshire and Leicester  and Kent coal field the  numbersof insured persons inoreased.   Ia all the others the numbersdeclined.
jafrLOYMilNT (CONTD. ) *Summary handed in by Mr..rhillips (Contd. ).*  Geographical  changes.       The industrial changes indioated above are reflected  also in the geographical distribution of the insured popula-  tion.   when the  numbers of insured persons  in the various  administrative divisions are examined it is 3een that while  during the past  four years there has  been no absolute decline  in any division  the rate of increase  has been very much more  rapid in the  four southern Divisions  - London South Eastern -  South Western and the  Midlands than in the  rest of the  Country - North  Eastern, North Western,  Wales and Scotland.       Thus since  July,  1923 the numbers in the South Eastern  Division have increased 15.83 per cent;  in  London 7.29 per  cent.,  South  Western 8.60 per cent, and in  the Midlands  6.03 per cent.       In Scotland the increase in the  same period has been  only 1.38 per cent., Wales 1.81 per cent.,  North Eastern  3.09 per cent, and North Western 3.73 per cent.       At July,  1927,  the Southern Section included 47 per cent.  of the insured population as compared with  45.7 per oent.  at  July,  1923.       In a number of industries consisting mainly of the  lighter industries,  such as glass bottle making; stationery;  stove grate and  general ironfoundry;  oils,  grease,  glue,soap,  etc.;  carpets and certain dress industries,  there was an  increase in the  numbers in the Southern Section coupled with  a  deoline in  the Northern Section.  In others such as con-  structional engineering; electrical engineering; motor  vehicles;  building materials; the distributive trades etc.  the  rate of increase has been greater in  the Southern than in the  Northern Section;  while in general and marine engineering;  leather goods; boots and shoes;  paper and paper board etc.  the rate of decline  has been less in  the South than in the  North.       There has been a  greater degree  of expansion or a smaller  degree  of decline  in the North than in the  South,  in industries  such as coke  ovens,  iron and steel and other metal manufacture,  explosives and chemicals,  and the manufacture of certain  metal goods where  the  North has  particular  natural advantages.                      AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     MR. SANDERSON stated that the last advices receivedshowed that there had been further good rains on the coastaldistricts of the Eastern States of the Commonwealth, and useful rain had also been reported inland.  It was now the time of year when relief could be expected frommonsoonal rains in the northern part of the Commonwealth,especially in Queensland.     The reports from Western Australia, both for stock and wheat, were good, although there were some traces of rust in the crops in many
1 r&apos;11 i 1AUSTRALIAN TRADE (CONTD.)northern centres.  The bulk of the wheat areas were,however, further south, and a very good crop was expectedthere.  South Australia had benefited from the recentrain, and in Victoria the crops had improved, except inthe north-western parts of the State.  In Now South wales the wheat crop had recovered considerably in the easternparts, and conditions had improved generally, except inthe far west, which was still very dry.   It was pasturethat was mainly affected there.     There was still considerable demand for bankingaccommodation, but caution was being exercised in makingadvances;  values both in towns and country were at ahigh level.  As was well known, a new Australian CustomsTariff had been introduced into the House of Representatives,and the Minister for Customs, in introducing the Bill,declared his belief that it would add  6,000,000 to thetrade of Australia, and  5,000,000 to that of Britain,or  11,000,000^. altogether to Empire Trade.     As to the British Trade Exhibition, the commonwealth government were cordially welcoming this, as it was their utmost desire to promote British trade in Australia without detriment to Australian industry.INDIAN TRADE.     MR. LINDSAY desired to refer to the Conference atGeneva on the prohibition of exports and imports.  the delegate- for India had expressed his obligations to theBritish delegation for their co-operation and the close contact which they maintained with him.  The Government tfIndia had approached the conference with the intention ofnot signing, but there was a possibility that they mightproceed to sign when they saw that the Convention hadreally been framed on broad and statesmanlike lines.     The figures for tho six months, April to Septemberthis year showed, in comparison with the statistics forthe corresponding period in each of the past three years, a steady rise in the imports into India of cotton textilesfrom this country.  In all three classes - grey, white and coloured - there was a consistent rise, so that for thosesix months of 1927 they were as far in advance of the totals for 1926 as those for that period of 1926 were inadvance for those for 1925.  There was also an advance inthe Japanese Imports.  In regard &quot;to cotton yam it was too early yet to say what effect the revised duty would have on imports into India.  At the same time it was worth noting, taking again those six months and comparing 1925with 1927, that the Imports of cotton yarn into India fromthe United. Kingdom had almost doubled, having risen from 7to 13 million pounds in weight, whilst the imports from japan had fallen from 19 to 11 million pounds, so that thiscountry had* regained a good deal of the ground which ithad lost to Japan after the slump.
                                   1 r7&apos;7INDIAN TRADE fCOHTB. )     Tho imports of British machinery were holding theirown, and Indian purchases were increasing, in spite of thefact that the demand for text lie machinery, which was so large a proportion of tho 3ndl.an imports, wa3 in a stagnantcondition;  that is to say, both the cotton and the jutoIndustries were, on the whole, taking only Juor. sufficientmachinery to sec\ire replacements s   It would give anidea of the proportion of tho British trade in machinery topoint out that in 1925, during the same six months, thetotal machinery imported from tho United Kingdom amountedto &amp;k crores out of a total of 7 crores. whilst this year it reached^ crores out of a total of Tg- croreso     In the jute and cotton industries, naturally therewas considerable fluctuation from month to month and from year to year in the relative values of the raw material andthe finished article.  The jute industry, after some yearsof rather doubtful profits, was now distinctly on the upgrade.  Taking 100 as the price of the raw material inJuly 1914 the figure it was paying now was represented by92;  at the same time it was receiving for its manufacturedgoods 156, i.e., half as much again as in 1914.  Thosefigures related to the Calcutta industry.  As a contrastthe figures for the Bombay cotton textile trade showed thattheir raw material was costing them 200, or twice the July1914 price, and that they were getting for theirmanufactured cotton goods 163, or about 60 per cent. overthe pre-war price.  There was thus a great contrast betweentho position of these two  staple Indian industries.     The crop outlook in India wss definitely favourable.For practically all the crops in which they were particular-ly interested just now, the autumn crop which had beenharvested, and the spring crop which was now growing, theoutlook was very good, and almost every forecast showed anincrease in acreage over last year.  The aggregate increase was roughly between 5 and 10 per cent, over last yearlsacreage.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     MR. HOSE wrote     &quot;Although it is still somewhat early to speakdefinitely of the prospects for the cereal crops in argentina, recent cable advices indicate that reaping ofwheat,  oats, and linseed is now becoming general, that thequality of the grain harvested is stated to be good, andthat satisfactory yields are practically assured, although,in the  Bahia district, the oats crop is likely to be somewhat disappointing. &apos; The opinion has been expressed insome quarters that, before the middle of the current month,all old-crop linseed will have been shipped from Argentinaand that exports of the new crop will commence without anysupplied being carried over.  Conditions in the principalimport  lines continue to improve, and, although business in woollen textiles generally is quiet, as the present time,is between seasons, prospects are considered good.  reports in regard to cotton textiles-are optimistic and marketprospects are undoubtedly much brighter than a year ago.The demand for hardware is better on the whole, and increased ordors from the camps are anticipated.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRAPS (CONTD.).     &quot;Further evidence of the marked expansion in the exporttrade of Argentina during the current year Is afforded by thelatest official returns of the imports and exports of theRepublic.  During the eight months January-August, 1927,exports amounted in value to $718,984,493 (gold), againstonly $562,744,455 in the corresponding period of 1926,whilst imports totalled $531,481,621 (gold), against$559,031,656.  There was thus established a visiblefavourable balance of trade of no less than $187,502,872(gold), against only $3,712,799.     &quot;Following upon tho arrangement of a credit in London of 5,000,000 for the Brazilian Coffee Institute, there was successfully issued in London on 24th November last a publicloan of  1,250,000 In 6 per cent. Guaranteed SterlingMortgage Bonds of the Bank of the State of San Paulo (theprincipal coffee growing State of Brazil) at the price of 92per cent.  Under the terms of issue, the whole proceeds will,bofore 31st December, 1929, be applied in making firstmortgage loans payable in gold milreis on the security of rural and urban properties of the State of San Paulo.  Thefacts that the Coffee Institute is successfully marketingthis season&apos;s large crop, and that higher prices are nowbeing obtained for coffee, combined with the new financial resources which have become available, have imparted adistinctly more optimistic tone in the coffee-producingdistricts.  Any improvement in tho position in the Interioris naturally refleoted in local markets; in fact, suchbusinesses as departmental stores, which respond mostreadily to any  change in the credit situation, have recently reported a marked improvement in sales, whilst it isunderstood that enquiries in many trade lines are assumingreassuring proportions.     &quot;With regard to Chile, conditions in the nitrate ofsoda market have recently shown a seasonal slackness, butproduction in Chile increased from 141,000 tons in september to 186,000 in October, during which month 46 oficinas were inoperation.  The output for November is estimated at 210,000tons, and a further expansion is anticipated, while thonumber of active oficinas is shortly expected to reach 65.Stocks in Chile were recently estimated at 595,000 tons, asoompared with 1,284,000 tons a year ago.  The fears at onetime entertained of the price of nitrate of soda rising to a level which might prejudice the prospects of a largeconsumption have not so far been substantiated.  In themeantime, however, the general commercial situation in Chileshows little improvement.  Sales of some lines of merchandiseincreased slightly during November, but Spring&quot;buying hasbeen muoh below normal, and some lack of confidence is apparent.  Uncertainty as to how Boon the Government will actupon its proposals to adjust the Customs Tariffs In an upward direction is a further restrictive element.  For themoment there are no prospects of an immediate improvement;in fact, if unsatisfactory weather conditions continue, thenew orops may be Beriously affected, with a correspondingadverse Influenoe on business in general.  The onlyfavourable circumstance in the outlook at the moment Is the
possibility of a further improvement in the nitrate industry.At the same time, it is satisfactory to note that the customs revenue of the Republic for the first nine months of thecurrent year amounted to $331,7 S,500, representing anincrease of some $i7,000,000 on the receipts for thecorresponding period of 1926.  The revenue for the month ofSeptember last totalled $34,890,800, or $7,015,500 more thanthat for September, 1926, the yield of nitrate export dutiesaccounting for $15,485,000, against only $7,738,000 in Septemberlast year.     &quot;In Peru, a slight decline ha3 been registered in cotton prices during the past month, but quotations for the stapleare still considerably higher than those ruling some nine months ago.  Sugar prices are substantially lower than thoseobtaining earlier in the year, but have latterly shown a slightly firmer tendency.  It has recontly boon reportedthat arrangements are being made for the issue of a furtherloan in New York on bohalf of the Peruvian Government, for thepuip ose of funding outstanding loans carrying higher ratesof interest, and stabilising exchange rates.  A 3lightly upward movement has occurred during the past fortnight in the sterlingvalue of the Peruvian pound, for which^the latest quotationrepresents a premium on sterling of 24^ per cent., against 35per cent. In the early days of January last.  Orders forforeign merchandise have recently been on a small scale, andBales in the Interior are slightly below normal.     &quot;With regard to the situation in the Central american countries, commercial conditions throughout Colombia are satisfactory, and the state of the River Magdalena, one ofthe principal arteries of transport of the Republic, is nowexcellent.  Unfortunately, owing to the poor coffee crop, the&quot;supplies of that commodity entering the local markets has been limited, and has been for the most part sold locally.  Ingeneral, however, sales by the stores have shown some improvement.  As evidence of the grovrth of United Statesinfluence in Nicaragua, it may be mentioned that, according toa recent report, an economic and financial survey of thecountry is being undertaken by an American representative,while it is learned simultaneously that negotiations are being conducted in New York for a loan to the Nicaraguan Government.General satisfaction is expressed in Nicaragua in regard tothe outlook for the 1927-28 coffee crop, the yield of which,excepting in the Matagalpa district, should be greater than in1926-27, and about the same as in 1925-26.  The level ofprices,however, is not as hijrb. as that ruling in 1925-26, andthere are as yet no indications of an improvement in generalbusiness conditions.&quot;SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (CONTD O.
