MANCHESTER     GUARDIAN(Political Correspondent)  2Sth October, 1927,  The official announcement that the Jockey Club favourlegislation to permit the introduction of the pari-mutuelsystem in this country will cause no surprise.   Ever sincethe law gave its sanction to the taxation of betting thecoming of the totalisator has gradually been  accepted asa foregone conclusion, and the main arguments  whichjustify the change are already familiar to our readers.  Ifbetting is to be taxed, it is to the general advantage that itshould be taxed in the most scientific manner, and therecan be no question that this condition is best satisfied bythe totalisator,  which provides by far the easiest methodof collecting the tax that has yet been devised by the witof man.  That,  from the point of view of racing in GreatBritain,  is the  first and also the latest advantage  whichthe system offers.   But it is by no means its only recom-mendation.   In  the Dominions  and Colonies and onthe Continent,  where it  has   been generally  adopted,experience has long shown that it has several others.  Itis fair, since the totalisator cannot cheat.  It records the exact state of public opinion  about the  chances of thehorses; declares the odds more accurately than is possiblein any other way; will raise a sum of money which willnot only be of real service to the interests of the sport, but is likely also to  benefit the cause of charity; and will tendto  mitigate the  turmoil and discomfort inseparable fromthe betting rings.  Our Racing Correspondent anticipatesthat there will be a certain amount of organized opposi-tion to the proposal, but he points out that it does  not atall mean the elimination of the bookmakers. It is indeedexpressly provided in the recommendation of the SpecialCommittee of the Jockey Club that their presence on race-courses should be permitted and  recognized.    In  other words, it is intended that it  shall be possible for thetotalisator and the bookmaker to flourish side by side, asthey actually do in most other  British countries.  Thereis no chance, of  course, that the necessary legislation willbe passed this autumn, but there is no longer any doubtsthat sooner or later the totalisator will become part andparcel of British racing methods.  While  the law  and policy of greyhound betting thushangs in  the balance, the Jockey Club  has  decided infavour of the totalisator.  It is very widely believed thatthe Jockey Club would not have taken this step unless theyhad some reason to believe that the Government wouldlegalise  the totalisator  if  the  controlling body of the
  MANCHESTER    GUARDIAN     (Editorial)6th  November, 1927. &quot; sport &quot; gave it its approval.   The Committee on the Betting Tax  discussed the totalisator, but as far  as I remember did not express either approval or disapproval.   The totalisator would make the collection of the betting tax much simpler.  If betting is to be allowed there is no reason why it should not be on the fairest possible plan, and if a betting tax is to be levied there is no reason why it should  not be levied  in  the  simplest and the  cheapest possible way.   On  the whole  the prospects   for  the totalisator seem to be bright.   The Jockey Club  and the Aga Khan have blessed  it, and it would suit the Chan- ceilor of the Exchequer.   Betting  and ways of betting on racehorses have  been very widely discussed during the last few years, and it has been curious to see the successive ditches into which the champions of that famous British phenomenon,  the bookmaker, have been driven.  When first the adoption of the totalisator was mentioned  the  cry was that nobody with the least interest in  racing would have anything to do with such an instrument it was equally offensive and injurious to the bookmaker, the gambler, the trainer, the owner, the racecourse  proprietors, the Jockey Club,  and everybody else.   Little  by little, representatives of all these  sectional interests  &quot;(except  the  bookmaker) have testified in favour of the totalisator, two of the latest and most important being the  Jockey Club itself and the Aga Khan, who was writing  in yesterday&apos;s &quot; Times &quot; and not without a certain amount of justification &quot; as one interested  in  racing and in the thoroughbred-breeding industry.&quot;  The absence  of the  bookmaker  from  this deepening  roar  of approval  for  the  principles  of  the totalisator would in itself be significant; can it be that the bookmaker is  the  only person about  a. racecourse  who stands to be damaged by the introduction of this different system ?  To put the matter very simply, such would seem to be the case.....If  betting has to be, it makes thatbetting simpler, fairer, far more easy to tax, and far moreconsiderate of  the interests of horse-breeders and owners.   MANCHESTER    GUARDIAN     - (Editorial)11th November, 1927.  &quot; Erom MR.  CHURCHILL&apos;S  answer  in  the House ofCommons yesterday it would seem that it is only a matterof months before the totalisator, that abhorred bogy ofthe bookmaker,  will be  seen  at work on British  race-courses.  It will need a special Act  of  Parliament toauthorise its appearance, but the Government has decidedthat if a private member&apos;s  Bill is produced for that pur-pose, and if the principle of the Bill is approved by a free vote of the House, then facilities will be given for its safeconduct to the Statute-book.  With the present House ofCommons, and with the blessing which that autocraticbody the Jockey  Club  has  officially bestowed on thetotalisator, there is little ground for doubt that the Bill,given luck in the ballot, will go through. It is true that itwill  involve the Parliamentary recognition of organisedbetting, but that point was  conceded when the much morefiercely  contested betting tax  was adopted,  and  one of several  arguments in favour of the totalisator (possibly the only one  which appeals to the CHANCELLOR OF THEEXCHEQUER) is that it will make that tax far less trouble-some to collect.   For that  reason he will  probably be infavour  of the additional  proposition that all betting,
whether in cash on a racecourse or by credit with a  &apos; corn-mission agent&apos;  in a city office,  should be made to pass through the totalisator.  Over such details of the  forth-coming Bill one can see some lively opposition from anyfriends whom the bookmaker may have in the Commons orcountry, but the answer to the outcry may be left until the text of the Bill is available.  All that need be said at pre-sent is that we are now appreciably nearer  a  very greatchange in the organisation of the British racecourse, andthat the  change, whatever its other merits  or demerits,should make that racecourse less of a  little Alsatia andmore of a civilised resort.&quot;   MANCHESTER     GUARDIAN(London Correspondent) 11th November,  1927.  &quot; Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL announced to-day that if aprivate member&apos;s Bill  to  legalise the totalisator  were passed by Parliament the Government  would considergiving it facilities.   This means that if Major Glynn oranybody else can get a place in the ballot for private Billsand can get a second-reading vote  in favour of a Totali-sator Bill the Government will see it has a committee stage, and in effect will see  it through.  This is, perhaps,as much as could  be expected.   I imagine that the totali-sator partisans will be thoroughly satisfied.  If we must have  betting, the totalisator,  after all, isthe fairest form of betting.  It is a calculating machine,or rather it is a machine with calculators behind it, andj ust as at Monte Carlo the zero against thirty-six numbersrepresents the modest percentage  of the bank, thoughlarge in the aggregate, so the 5 per cent, or whatever it isof the totalisator will be a small burden on the gamblerbut a large aggregate to the racegoers and the Exchequer.Mr. Churchill has really let himself in for this innovationby adopting the betting tax at all.   He has not got much money out of the  tax, and instead  of dropping it he willmost  certainly support  all  legislation that will legaliseand will regularise betting and will simplify the means of collection.&quot; MORNING POST  -  (Editorial)28th October, 1927.  The Committee (Jockey Club) are of opinion that the changes which they propose would produce a valuable contribution to the  maintenance of sport.   They wouldcertainly produce a valuable contribution to the main-tenance of the Exchequer a consideration to which MR.CHURCHILL will certainly not be insensible.   If  it alsoassists the falling revenues from racecourse meetings byattracting a larger public, it will in the long run be in theinterest of the bookmaker as much as of the backer.  TheCHANCELLOR can still salve his conscience, as he rakes inhis share of the bets, with the pretence that he has notlegalised betting itself,  and  that he holds it still in extreme horror and reprobation.   The public at large willbe well content with an experiment which promises tomake for their convenience and protection.  DAILY MAIL    (Editorial)2Sth October, 1927.  The Jockey Club is of opinion that bookmakers shouldbe allowed on racecourses side by side with the totalisatoron such a basis of graduated payments as  to put them on a level footing.  They are also of opinion that creditoffice bookmakers should be treated  in a similar manner.This is  a compromise decision and will, no doubt,  gainthe  support of many  sportsmen who, while appreciating
the convenience of the totalisator, are  anxious to seefair play all round.  From the point of view of collecting a betting tax thetotalisator  has obvious advantages.  On the other hand,it  is  expensive  to run,  and  will naturally lessen thebusiness  now done by bookmakers.   If ever it is sane-tioned by the law, it will  have to justify itself solely onresults.DAILY EXPRESS    (Editorial) 12th May, 1927   WESTMINSTER      GAZETTE(Racing Correspondent) 28th November, 1927.  The mechanised bookie has a number of obvious advan-tages.   Owners and trainers would benefit &quot;each way,&quot;and they, after all, are the men most concerned with thesport.  Racecourse managements would be provided withmoney to carry out  progressive policies, and tax collec-tion would be simple and cheap.  We are glad to see theprogress of the cause of the &quot; tote.&quot;  &quot;The flat-racing season  of 1927 has  come to an end,and if  one  believed the  gloom-mongers  it  might  beimagined that not only a season, but racing itself, hadended.  This is nonsense.  The basis of the sport is as strong as it has ever been,but it has passed through an abnormal year, and it maypass through another of the  same kind,  or even two,  inwhich we must  be  prepared for many changes,  mostnotable  among  them  being  the introduction  of  theTotalisator.  This last  abnormal  season can be accounted  for  in several ways. Those who derive their income from divi-dends have seen them considerably reduced by the smallerprofits from companies and businesses, due largely to thecoal strike of last season, and they have not been able to goracing as regularly as heretofore.  It has been the wettest summer and autumn known forgenerations,  and this has  undoubtedly affected attend-ances adversely.  People go racing to enjoy themselves,and there is little enjoyment in spending a day on a race-course in a downpour of rain.  There has arisen a new counter-attraction in the grey-hound racing where prices of admission are low, and thegame is played after working hours.  $fa          $fa           -X&quot;          $fa          $fa  Racing being for the moment in a transition stage the cold fact has  to be confronted by racecourse executivesthat it is too dear. At some important courses it is worth the  money. At many places it is not.  $fa          $fa           $fa           $fa          $fa  When the  Totalisator comes, betting will be made tocontribute to the upkeep of racing, which it does not  donow.  A proportion of the profits of the machine will go backto the executives for the  purpose of increasing stakemoney,  providing better accommodation for the public,and, it is to be hoped, for reducing admission fees.  Probably we shall come to a time in the next  decadewhen there will be only one racecourse where three nowexist, but the survivors will be big racecourses, with everycomfort for the public, good stake money to be run for,and the highest charge for admission ten shillings.  Thenpeople will come racing in vastly greater numbers.&quot;
EVENING STANDARD      (Editorial)  28th October, 1927.  SUNDAY TIMES     (Editorial)13th November, 1927.    The  only  serious  objections  to  the  use  of  the  totalisator, apart from the expense of installation  and  its unavoidable interference with vested interests, are its  unfamiliarity and  the fact that the system on which  it  works seems at iirst a little difficult to understand.  It is  improbable,  indeed,  that its  novelty  will  be of  any  advantage to it.....    Putting the interests  of both  backer  and bookmaker  for the moment on one side, the innovation is, on other  grounds, clearly desirable.  If it was to be wished before,  the Betting Tax has made the necessity  for it almost  imperative.  One obstacle in the way of that was long  the difficulty of collection, and we may surmise that,  had  it seemed easier, more than one previous  Chancellor of  the   Exchequer   would   have   risked  the   others.  MR. CHURCHILL at last dashingly put the Treasury horse  at the fence, but it cannot be said that the performance  of either rider or mount would have secured unqualified  commendation at any financial horse show.  There seem  to be too many possibilities of confusion and leakage, and  the cost of collection is high.  It will manifestly be much easier  to  collect money from a machine  than  from  a gentleman with a  satchel.  (This  will  also apply,  in certain cases, as much to the backer as to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.)   The bookmaker will eventually suffer, though probably not so much or soon as at present he seems to fear.  Those who will suffer first will be those who most deserve it, the smaller men, who do not inspire confidence. The larger and more  reputable firms will no doubt be able to main- tain themselves for  a long time against the competition of the machine.   But  even they must look forward to a process at any rate fending towards their elimination.   And why not? There is no reason to cast stones at them as a class, but they have no claim to public  gratitude if it be shown that the work they at present perform can be better and more conveniently carried out in another way.  It is not likely  that the process of elimination  will be  rapid enough  to cause anything approaching  hardship  in deserving individual cases.   And, now that the Betting Tax has made betting an integral part of our national economy, it is desirable that they should be eliminated,  and that  the whole business should  be made as strictly  mechanical as possible that is  to  say,  that backers should  bet  with  one  another through machines and not through  human specialists. A future without bookmakers does not look unbearably gloomy to the community at large.   By their introduction of the betting tax the Govern- ment have already given  official recognition to betting, and the totalisator  would  seem to be no  more than a logical next step.  It ought, indeed, to be the signal for a drastic revision of our betting laws, which, as  they stand at present, are contradictory and hypocritical.  If betting of all kinds,  whether in cash on the course or  by ci^edit  through an agent, were  officially  recognised  by making it compulsory for all bets to be passed throughthe totalisator, it might be no bad thing.   It would notdestroy the  bookmaker  (though  naturally,  it  would diminish his sphere of usefulness); it  would remove con-fusion of the law; and it would turn English racecoursesinto more pleasant and more civilised  resorts.
SATURDAY REVIEW      The totalisator alters for the better the whole character   (Unsigned article)      of a meeting ....  It is doubtful whether there will be 5th November, 1927.    room on many English racecourses for the totalisator and                        the queues that line up before it, but about the beneficial                        change that the relegation of the bookmaker into the back-                        ground makes in the whole character of our race-meetings                        the experience of France and Belgium leaves no room for                        doubt.                          So far so good.   When the betting tax was introduced                        there were many who prophesied that inevitably the State                        would be  driven to easier and more efficient methods of                        collecting the tax, and the bookmakers by their very short-                        fdghted opposition to the tax have undoubtedly hastened                        the arrival of the totalisator by a few years.   For  one                        great advantage of the totalisator is that it automatically                        collects the betting  tax.  Unfortunately most of  the                        betting of the country is done not on the. race-course  but                        through the &quot;starting-price&quot; offices.   It is illegal in                        England away from  a race-course to  hand  money to a                        bookmaker to put on the result of a race, but quite legal to                        telephone  or telegraph a bet, or even to send it through the                        post, provided that no money is enclosed with it.                          The law as it stands almost amounts to this : that while                        cash betting is illegal away  from a race-course, credit                        betting changes a bookmaker into acommission agent. The                        cash business is an offence for the police courts, the credit                        business is a source of profit  to  the Post Office.  Yet of                        the two kinds of betting, the cash bet is safer because there                        is less danger in it of a man getting beyond his means.                        The present state of the law is wholly indefensible, and                        stands in no sort of relationship to any intelligible system                        of morals  or public policy; indeed its manifest unfairness                        as between richer and poorer members of society has done                        not a  little to bring law into  contempt, and  to give                        currency to the saying that there is one law  for the rich                        and another for the poor.  The establishment of  the                        totalisator would make it necessary to revise the whole of                        our betting law, for it would clearly be wrong to have a                        scale of taxation  for betting on the race-course which                        could in fact be evaded by those who bet through a corn-                        mission agent and  may never have contributed a single                        pound of admission fee to the upkeep of a race-course.                          In the   long  run,  the totalisator  would inevitably                        swallow up all other mediums of betting, both in order to                        make sure that the tax is paid in full on all betting trans-                        actions and to prevent betting away from race-courses                        being exempted from the contributions which, by general                        agreement, it is proposed that the totalisator should exact                        for the good of the sport and the greater comfort of those                        who attend race-meetings.  Two alternatives immediately                        present themselves.   Either all betting should be made                        legal, and it should be perfectly lawful for a man to open                        a betting  shop and do a cash  trade over the counter.                        Or if, as many people will, we shrink from that alterna-                        tive, we should consider  the  advisability of making all                        betting illegal  that is  not done through  a  totalisator.                        That would mean that betting through the  starting-price                        offices would be illegal unless the amount of the stakes were                        remitted to the totalisator on the course.  The big corn-                        mission agents eould do that; the smaller agents could not,                        and the result would probably be the formation of a  big                        betting trust in close relations with the totalisator.
    SPECTATOR  (Unsigned article)5th November, 1927. DAILY HERALD    (Editorial)28th October, 1927.   We are not enamoured of State participation in this business,  but it should seriously be considered whether the totalisator had not better be run by the State, if, as most of us believe, the betting tax has come to stay.   What cannot be suppressed ought to be taxed as heavily as is practicable in order to restrain it.  Betting is one of the greatest of our public luxuries.  So far the Govern- ment have made a mere beginning of taxation by taxing only credit betting and race-course  betting.   They left ready-money &quot;street&quot; betting alone because they shrank from setting up licensed betting offices which  are said to be the only conceivable means of bringing street-betting under control.   If the totalisator should be adopted, as we  feel sure it will be, a different complexion will be put  upon the whole attitude of the State towards betting.  The principle for which we have long contended will in fact be  accepted  that it is wise to discourage by taxation what  you cannot prevent, and that if taxation is the remedy,  or partial remedy, it must be applied as scientifically as possible. Beyond all doubt the totalisator  is the  most scientific means of  taxing betting yet invented.   It gives the  true odds; it does not cheat; it can be made to contribute to the support  of racing; it may leave something over for charity;  it collects a  revenue for the State with the smallest possible  expenditure upon administration.   Soby all means let us have it.  Generally speaking, this  co-operative method  of  bet-ting is fairer to the average &quot; punter &quot; than any othersystem,  but many racing men  dislike it because theyprefer to pit their wits against  those of the bookmaker,in an endeavour to get a longer price about a  horse than is likely to be obtainable at the start of the race.EASTERN DAILY PRESS       (Editorial)   29th October, 1927.  SUNDAY NEWS  (Unsigned article)6th November, 1927.   There are many who believe that all betting should be made illegal, but we think there are also  many people will agree that if allowed at all it should be carried on under State supervision, and that, so far as possible,  any profits realised should be used for the benefit of the com- munity as a whole.   The Jockej&apos;  Club  has just  decided to recommend  the adoption of the totalisator or pari-mutuel on race-courses. For this  purpose legislation is  necessary,  and  there appears  to be every  reason  to suppose  that it  must have  the  support of, even if  it is not initiated by,  the Government, which decided to tax betting as a means of providing  money for the  Exchequer.  So  far as  the public is  concerned, there  seems to be little doubt that the totalisator  would be more  satisfactory as a means of doing its  betting business, and that it would  simplifyvery greatly the collection of the betting tax.  The lead given last week by &quot; Sunday News &quot; . .  . .on- the solid benefits  of  the Totalisator .... many ofthe great  owners who have  Dominion experience areemphatic  that  the &quot; Tote &quot; will mean a cleaner and abetter deal for all concerned.
II.-AGAINST.  NAME OF PAPER.      TRUTH  (Unsigned article)5th November,  1927.EXTRACT.  &quot; Personally  I have  always had, and still have,  arooted objection to the use of these betting machines; butthere can be no doubt of the thoroughness of the inquirymade by the Committee of the Jockey Club, and it wouldseem  that,  in  their opinion, the advantages which willaccrue to racing from funds derived from a tax on themoney passing  through the  machines  outweigh other considerations.  I  hope  they may be right.   The successof what I  cannot help  calling a venture will, I think,depend largely upon the amount of the tax or percentageto be deducted  from the  money  passing  through the machines.   In France this  amounts to 11 per cent., and since the payment of 3i  per cent., the maximum tax paid under Mr. Churchill&apos;s scheme,  is said, and I  believe withreason, to have been detrimental to racing, it is difficultto see how an improvement is to be brought about by thepayment of a much greater tax (and I may here mention that the French  Government  does  not, as  is  generallysupposed, directly participate  in the money produced bythe betting machines).  To my mind it is at all events satisfactory to note thatthere does not appear to be any intention of abolishing the bookmakers, and, unless  taxed out of  existence, Ihave  no doubt whatever that  they will hold their ownagainst the machines, and  will, at all events, retain thecustom of a very large section  of the betting community.As the situation develops it will be possible to  deal with it more clearly, but I cannot help thinking that the Turfauthorities are unduly  alarmed at the state  of  affairs which has  arisen, and  which  is, I think, transitory innature.&quot;SPORTING LIFE   (Editorial) 12th May, 1927.

This paper with other sporting papers repre-senting the bookmakers  has,  almost  daily,  arguments against the totalisator.)  &quot; Naturally we have our own views and are still o?the opinion that, from the point of view of the averagebacker of horses, the &apos; Tote &apos; does not look too sound a financial! benefit.&quot;  &quot; Meanwhile, the  majority  of  those interested  inbetting, without which it is admittedly impossible forracing to be carried on in this country,  are thoroughlyconvinced that the &apos; machine &apos; will prove  unworkable.&quot;  &quot; We have more than once stated what, in our belief,are&apos; the principal  objections to the Totalisator.....We repeat  that we are dead against the Totalisator.&quot;  &quot; Having considered the  matter carefully from  all aspects, the writer is firmly of the opinion the public willhave the good sense  to see the  Totalisator  cannot be ofany benefit  to them.&quot;

EVENING STANDARD&apos;     Arguments against H.H. the Aga  Khan&apos;s proposals (Racing correspondent)    for the Totalisator.  7th November, 1927.        TRUTH            &quot; Yet I cannot divest myself of the conviction that it  9th November, 1927.    will be inimical to the best interests of racing.&quot;
