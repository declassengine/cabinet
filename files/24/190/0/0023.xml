In the Memorandum on this subject .vhich I circulated in  December, 192*3,  (C .P .420(25)), I called attention to the continued  agitation against the restrictions imposed by the Orders        .  .  (&quot;D.O.R.A.&quot;) in  force under the Shops Act of 1920, particularly  in regard to the sale of sweets and tobacco, and stated that I  proposed to appoint a Departmental Committee%to review the  question.  This  Committee  was duly set up under the Chairmanship  of Sir W. Mackenzie, G.B.E.,K.C, and after a very full inquiry,  it has now presented its Report,  a copy of which I attach.        The Committee, which included 9 Members of the House of  Commons,  was representative of all shades of opinion and interests,  and it is therefore most satisfactory to find that it has arrived  at a nearly unanimous agreement,  the Report being signed, subject  to one or two reservations, by the whole Committee.  The evidence  before the Committee confirmed the view that the general closing  provisions have  been of great value  to both shopkeepers and shop-  assistants,  without causing any serious inconvenience to the  public generally,  and the Committee  recommends that the Shops  Act  of 1920 with the amending Act of  1921,  whioh have  been continued  from year to year under the Expiring Laws Acts,  should now be  discontinued and that new  legislation should be  passed to provide  &quot;for the permanent adoption  of general early closing on the  existing  lines.        The Committee adheres generally to the present compulsory  closing hours -  8 p.m. on days other than Saturday,  and 9 p.m. on  Saturday  (though it would give the local authority power to  substitute another day for  Saturday  as the late  night), but it  proposes  a number of modifications in detail of  the existing
arrangements and in particular recommends certain relaxations forthe purpose of meeting the complaints in regard to the sale of tobacco and confectionery.      As regards confectionery, the proposal is to exemptaltogether the sale of confectionery in theatres, cinemas, etc.provided the sale is confined strictly to bona fide members ofthe audience and otherwj.se to continue the later hours permitted under the Act of 1921 (10 p.m. on Saturdays and 9.30 p.m. on other week-days) subject to a special provision enabling thelocal authority at tho request of a majority of the confectionersin the district to fix earlier closing hours (but not earlier thanthe hours generally in force).  As regards tobacco and cigarettes,it is proposed (l) to grant the same exemption for sales intheatres, etc., as in the case of confectionery;  (2) to permitsales in hotels and other licensed premises during the whole ofthe permitted hours for the sale of intoxicating liquor, subjectto a condition, v/hich the Committee state licensees are preparedto accept,  limiting the quantity to be sold to any one customer;and (3) to  empower the local authority, if a two-third majorityof the tobacconists in the district so desire, to fix a laterclosing hour, up to 9.30 p.m. (or 10 p..m. on the late night).These proposals may result in somewhat later hours of closing forconfectioners&apos; and tobacconists&apos; shops in some areas but they ought to remove any real cause of complaint on the ground ofinconvenience to the public while still giving the confectionersand tobacconists in any district a choice of closing at the samehours as the other shops.      I need not perhaps refer specially to any of the othermodifications suggested, a summary of which will be found at theend of the  Report, except perhaps the- proposal to cancel thepresent exemption for the sale of newspapers so far as shopsare concerned while continuing it in respect of streets and other places (paragraph 22 of Report); the proposal to give the localauthoritj.es at holiday resorts power to fix later hours for not

In view of the agreement now reached by the Committee Ithink that the ri-:ht course clearly is to accept and give effectto the Committee&apos;s recommendations, and in the recent Debate onthe Expiring Laws Continuance Bill of this Session under whichthe D.0.R.A, restrictions are being continued for another yea&quot;^I was urged by protagonists on both sides - Sir Frank Meyerand Mr. James Stewart, to translate the Committee13 report into action at an early date.  I should be glad therefore if theCabinet would authorise the immediate preparation of a Bill,with a view to its being introduced in the early part of next session.      I cannot be certain that the Bill will be treated as quite  Iunoontroversial.  The exemptions proposed for theatres, cinemas&amp;c. and licensed houses may excite opposition from some of theshopkeepers,  but I should hope that the Bill will be generally accepted as settling a troublesome question.      The Committee&apos;s inquiry covered Scotland, and theSecretary of State for Scotland agrees that the proposed Billshould extend to Scotland.20th December, 1927.

                    Report to  the    Right Honourable the  Secretary  of State for  the                   Home Department                         hy IhcDepartmental Committee appointed to inquire intothe  working  of  the  Shops  (Early  Closing)  Acts,                   1920 and 1921.SIR,  We have the honour to present to you our  Report on the inquiry  you instructed us to  make on 11th  March, 11)27.                     I. INTRODUCTION.  1.  We were  appointed  to  inquire  into the  working of the shops  (Early Closing) Acts, 1920  and 1921, and to considerwhether it  is desirable that those Acts should or should not bemade permanent and if made permanent whether with or withoutmodifications.  The further question whether  it is desirable thatretail sales at exhibitions  should be permitted after the closing hour for shops  was subsequently referred to us.  2.  We have  held  twenty-one meetings  and sat in  public allday  on fourteen  occasions for the  purpose of  hearing  oral evidence.   During the course of the  inquiry we  have  examinedupwards of one  hundred witnesses.  The traders&apos;  or shopkeepers&apos;point of view was stated by witnesses representing a numberof particular  Trade Federations and Associations as well  as theNational  Chamber  of  Trade,  the Birmingham  Chamber  ofCommerce  and  the London and Suburban Traders&apos; Federation.Tho  National Union of Distributive  and  Allied  Workers, andthe Natioual Amalgamated Union  of Shop  Assistants,  Ware-housemen and  Clerks stated  the  case for the shop assistants.The  views of authorities concerned with  the administration  ofthe Shops Acts were expressed by witnesses representing theAssociation of  Municipal  Corporations, the  County   councils association, the Incorporated Society of Inspectors of weights and  Measures,  the Northern and  Midland Market AuthoritiesAssociations,  the London  County Council  and the Corporationsof Glasgow, Aberdeen and Bridlington.  Representatives of theEarly Closing Association, the Parliamentary Committee of theCo-operative  Congress,  the  Standing Joint  Committee of In-dustrial  Womens&apos;  Organisations,  the  Scottish  Council  forWomen&apos;s Trades, the Promoters of  Exhibitions, Shopkeepersat Seaside Resorts, as well  as a number of individuals  con-tributed an important body of  evidence.   In addition we  havereceived a  considerable volume  of written  evidence:  We desireto express our indebtedness to those who  have attended to give
 evidence or have supplied us with  information on the subject of our  inquiry.  A list of the witnesses appears in Appendix B and a summary of the Evidence in Appendix C.            II. STATEMENT OK TUB  EXISTING  LAW.   3.  There are two  sets of provisions at present  in  force  (one permanent and one temporary) relating to the compulsory closing of shops for the serving of customers.  The  permanent provisions are contained  in  the Shops Acts. 1912C)  and  1913(b), and the temporary  in  the Shops  (Early Closing)  Acts of 1920(&quot;)  and 1921C).               (a) Shops  Acts,  1912 and  1913.   4.  The  Shops  Act, 1912,  requires every shop  (with certain exceptions) to be closed for ;i half-holiday  once a  week; it  also empowers the local  authorities, if they  think  it  expedient,  to make Closing  Orders with  the  consent of the occupiers of  at least two-thirds  of  the shops  affected,  requiring shops (with certain  exceptions)  to close for the  serving  of  customers  in the evening on  the other days of  the  week  at  an  hour not earlier  than 7 o&apos;clock.  The Shops Act, 1913, amends the Act of 1912 in its application to premises for the sale of refreshments.   A  considerable number  of  Closing  Orders was made under the Shops Act, 1912, and the Act which preceded it (the Shop Hours Act, 1904(c) ), but until the 30th October, 1916, on which date  the General Early Closing Order  under  the  Defence  of the Realm Regulations  came  into force, early closing was  still the exception  rather than  the rule  in the  retail  trades of the country.   We  set out in Appendix A particulars of the Closing Orders  that  have  been  made  in  England   and Wales  and Scotland.              (6)  Shops (Early Closing) Act, 1920.   5.  Owing to circumstances arising  from the war  a serious shortage of coal  occurred  early  in 1916,  and efforts were made to increase supplies  by securing more  regular work on the  part of the miners  and by bringing back  enlisted miners from units serving at home.  These measures were not, however, adequate to produce the additional supply  required, and it became evident that  the  balance  would have to be  made  up  by  economies  at home.   Various  restrictions on  the  use of artificial light  had already been imposed by Regulations under the Defence of the Realm  Act, 1914, and  it was decided to restrict its. use  still further by closing shops  under the same procedure.  An ad- ditional   regulation  (No.   10B)  was  accordingly  made   on 24th  October,  1916(0, giving  the Secretary of  State power by. Order to restrict either generally or in particular areas the hours in the  evening during which any class of business might be &quot;     (*) 2Geo. V. Ch.24.

 carried  on,  and  an Order  under  this regulation  was  drafted requiring  all shops, with  a  few necessary exceptions, to be closed at 7 p.m. during the  winter on days other than Saturday and at  9  p.ni.  on  Saturday.   There was at the time a growing movement among shopkeepers in favour of earlier closing due no doubt  to  some  extent to war conditions such as the loss of  assistants,  the  falling off of evening trade consequent on  the lighting  restrictions  already in force, and the shortage of  supplies;  and the replies received from representative local authorities and trade organisations who were consulted showed that there  was general agreement  that an Order fixing the evening closing hour for shops was desirable. No individual shopkeepers appear to have been  consulted.  The hour proposed  was considered  suitable  both  in  England  and Scotland for days other than  Saturday though an appreciable number of trade  organisations suggested 6 or  6.30 p:m. from Monday  to Thursday.   A  considerable body of  opinion  also favoured the fixing of  a later hour on  Friday,  on the  ground mainly  that Friday is in many  cases pay-day, sometimes  .ilso market  day, and  that a great deal  of shopping is done on  that evening.  Nine o&apos;clock  as  the  closing hour  on Saturday  was almost   universally  approved.   An Order  of the  Secretary of StateC) was accordingly made under  No. 10b  of  the Defence of the Realm Regulations on 24th October, 1916, fixing 7 o&apos;clo--k as the  closing  hour from Monday to Thursday. 8 o&apos;clock on Friday  and 9  o&apos;clock  on  Saturday, subject to  the  statutory holiday  on one half-day.   In consequence,  however, of representations  made  in  the House of CommonsC) that the closing of shops at 7 p.m. on three days a  week would ruin many  thousands  of  small traders and inflict serious  hardship and inconvenience on large numbers of women  who were compelled to  shop after returning  from their work in munition factories,  this Order was never put into force, and a new Order dated 27th October, 1916(c), was made, fixing 8 n.m. as the closing hour on every day of the week  other than Saturday subject to the half-days holiday.  As already explained, the principal object of the first General Early Closing Order was to effect economy in the consumption of coal for  lighting  pur- poses, and for that reason the application of the Order was in the first instance limited to the winter months.   In the spring of 1917, representative local authorities and trade organisations were consulted as to the  advisability of  continuing the Order, and the replies,  added to many  spontaneous expres- sions of opinion, made it clear that there  was a  very  general desire  for  its  continuance-the  special  grounds being  (1) the- benefit to the health of the increasing number of women and girls who, as a result  of the male assistants joining the  Naval and                (*) Not printed.

 Military forces, were employed in the  retail trades; and (2) the desirability of allowing time  for cultivation of allotments, drill- ing, and other work of national  importance.    The Order was accordingly continued  for  the  summer, of  1917,  and again in September of that year and again in April, 1918.  In September, 1918, it was continued in force until further notice.   These Orders, popularly known, inter  alia,  as  &quot; DORA,&quot; would in the ordinary course have expired  either  on 31st August, 1920 (in accordance with the provisions of the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Act(a)), or on the date of the termination of the War when declared by Order in Council, whichever date was the  later.  The early  closing arrangements which had been in force for nearly four years had, it was  argued, proved  beneficial to shopkeepers and their  assistants, and  a very general  desire was expressed  for the continuance of the system.  The National Federation of Small Traders Protection Associations, which had been opposed  to the fust Order on the ground that it would ruin the small trader, urged tho Government to extend the system for another year.   Meanwhile  a Private  Members  Bill(b)  which proposed to abolish the system of Closing Orders instituted by the  Shops Act. 1912, and to substitute provisions requiring the closing of all shops at a fixed hour on the lines of the system which  had been in operation during the  War,  was introduced and passed successfully through Committee.  Tee Bill, however. was seriously amended on the  Report stage and  was dropped. The Government then decided to introduce a Bill to continue the existing Order  pending the introduction and consideration of a permanent measure.  This Bill(c) was introduced on July 22nd. 1920, and passed easily through both Houses of Parliament. As explained  by  the Home  Secretary during  the  debate on the Second Reading(J).  &quot; the Bill did not propose to take any per- manent stand  with  regard to hours or  anything else ;  it simply said that there being a. great  diversity of  opinion n.nd choice amongst those concerned, opportunity ought to be given for dis- cussion and investigation.&quot;   The  new Act, entitled the Shops (Early  Closing) Act, 1920. made  no change  in  the   existing arrangements except that  (1) it gave power to the Secretary of State to suspend the operation of the Order for such days as he thought fit during the Christmas season, or in connection  with any other special occasion, and  (2) it provided that the General Parly Closing  Order should have effect as if it  were ai Closing Order made  and confirmed under the Shops  Act, 1912.  The latter provision had the effect of transferring the duty of enforce- ment from the Police, who  had been responsible  under  theDefence of the Realm  Act, to the local  authorities who were     (*) 10-11 Geo. &quot;Y.

When the  General Early Closing  Order was first made  in1916 it did not interfere with the sale of.sweets in theatres; butas a result of representations that an unfair advantage was beingenjoyed by the theatres, the Order was subsequently amended  soas to place the  sale of sweets in theatres on  the same footing as  the sale in  shops.    After  the  Armistice, repeated  effortswere  made by the managers of the theatres  to get the  Orderrelaxed in their favour.  The claim on  behalf of the theatreswas at first opposed  by the retail confectioners, but later they came to  agreement  with the managers of the  theatres  that10  p.m.  on  Saturday and 9.30 on other weekdays should  befixed as  the  closing hours for  the sale of sweets generally.In  1921, during the debate on the Expiring Laws continuance bill,(&quot;) which included  the Shops  (Early  Closing) Act,  1920.a strong opinion was expressed by various members in the Houseof  Commons  that  the  wishes of the  retail  confectioners, thetheatres  managers and  the  ice cream  trade should  be met;and the Government undertook that if  a special Bill was  intro-duced  by  a private member for the  purpose, it should  be givenevery assistance.  A  short Bill(b)  was accordingly introduced toallow  the  sale of sweets and ice cream  up to  the agreed hours.It was amended in Committee  by the insertion of &quot; fruit and table waters &quot; and became law on the 19th august, 1921.  The effect of the Act was that the closing hour for the sale of&quot; fruit, table waters, sweets, chocolates or  other sugar  confectionery-stationery or ice cream &quot; was fixed at 9.30 p.m. on weekdays otherthan Saturdays  and 10  p.m. on  Saturdays.  7. The Act of 1920 and the  Act  of 1921 have since been  re-newed annually under the Expiring Laws Continuance Act.  S. The result of  the legislation has been to create a number ofdifferent compulsory closing hours for  the various shops  in thesame  area.  Thus, where  a Closing Order has been obtainedunder the Shops Act, 1912, the closing hour is often 7 p.m.  forthe traders affected by the Order.  Under the Act  of 1920, the closing hour for the sale of certain articles is 8 p.m. from Mondayto Friday  and 9 p.m. on Saturdays.   Under the Act of 1921, the closing hour for the sale of certain other articles is  9.30 p.m.from Monday to Friday and 10 p.m. on  Saturday, while for thesale of certain  other exempted articles  there  is no compulsoryclosing hour.  In addition  there is  in most trades a compulsorygeneral half-holiday closing.(&quot;) Official Report 15th August, 1921, Col. 1014.(b) The Shops (Early Closing) Act (1920) Amendment Bill.
                    111. CONS I DEIJATJ ox s.  9. The object of the  exemptions in the Acts and of the varia-tion in the hours of closing was to ease  the rigidity of a generalhard-and-fast  rule for the closing  of shops.  Sonic  exemptionsare no longer required and many of the iestrictions ha%&apos;e servedtheir purpose and may  be discontinued.  10. The habits  and customs of the people  in  regard  to shop-ping hours differ in  various parts of the  country.  A  compulsoryclosing hour which is convenient for the shopping public in one area may be inconvenient in another area ; and even in the same area, while one section  of the shopping public may not be ineon-venienced by  the  closing  hour, another  section may find it un-suitable.  Moreover, certain classes of goods may be  sold mostlyin the early hours of the day, while other classes may have a-substantial sale in the later hours of the evening.  The applica-tion of one  rigid rule for  the closing of  shops should, therefore,be exercised with caution.  11. There is much to be said in  favour of the view  that thegeneral compulsory  closing hours for shops having  been  introrduced  as a  war-time measure to economise in the consumptionof coal, lighting and luxury foods should  now be allowed  to lapse,and that if it is necessary to restrict the  hours of employment ofshop assistants this is a matter which should be the subject ofparticular legislation, the  question of early closing being decidedunder  the provisions of the Shops  Act,  1912.  We  have givendue consideration  to this  view but,  after an examination of theevidence, have come to  the conclusion that it  is not one  that canbe acted on.  12. We have endeavoured to look at the matter oF the ShopsActs, 1920 and 1921 as a  whole ; and in considering  the general question of shop hours we have had regard to the interests of theshopkeepers and the  shop assistants as  well as the convenience of the  general public.  The experience of  the  last ten  yearsshows that a. general closing hour, such as S p.m., has been ofgreat benefit to shop assistants and  shopkeepers.  It was statedbefore us that the  general  health  of shop assistants  had  im-proved, and that they benefited in other ways from being relieved from the great hardship of the long hours which they formerlyhad to work.  We are satisfied that some restrictions are neces-sary to prevent a return to former conditions, even if they shouldtend to the detriment  of  some shopkeepers  and to  the incon-venience of  a section of the shopping public.  13. We are further satisfied that  it would be very difficult, ifnot impossible, to secure these restrictions by voluntary agree-ment.  14. We have considered whether this object could not  beachieved by limiting the  hours of employment  in shops  whilefixing a later  compulsory closing hour for shops  or without re-quiring them to be closed  at all.  Such a solution  of the  problem
would have  public  advantage of minimising  the  inconvenience  tothe public inherent in the early closing method, while affordinga protection to shop assistants.  This method  would, however,inevitably lead to  the introduction of a shift system in a largenumber  of shops.   The  shift or relay  system, which may  be suitable  for restaurants and other places of refreshment, would  be impracticable in certain  classes of retail shops, and  in  othersinconvenient and costly to the shopkeepers and thus ultimatelytend  to  increase the price of commodities  to the consumer.   Itwould also greatly increase  the difficulties of  effective adininis-tration.  15. We have also  considered the possibility  of differentiatingbetween shops in  which assistants arc employed and  those  inwhich they are not, and requiring the first class to close at a fixed, hour while leaving the second class free to remain opento any hour.  We think such a method would give rise  to serious administrative  difficulties  and  would,  in  addition,  be  open  toother objections, not least among them  being  the undesirabilityof allowing shops  where  no assistants are employed, unlimitedhours to compete with shops  conducted with the aid of assistants.  16. We have also considered the proposal that  no paid  assisl-ant be employed in  a shop  after a- certain hour for  example,8 p.m.  on certain  nights and 9  p.m.  on the  late  night.  Theadoption of such a  scheme would remove the complaint of shop assistants that they are at present sometimes kept on duty in the shop  after the  shop is closed by law for serving customers.   Itwould enable any shopkeeper, if he chose,  to keep open after thegeneral  closing hour  provided  lie employed no  paid  assistant.after  that hour.  It  would also enable  the customer,  who hadrun short  of provisions, whether through sudden emergency  oroversight,  to purchase at  any such  shop  as  might  he open,without  committing  a breach  of the  law. Further,  it  would meet  the grievances of small shopkeepers  who  are struggling  tomake both ends meet and also  of that  type of  small shopkeepernear the terminal stations, for instance, in London, who formerlydid a fair  trade with excursionists between the hours of 8 p.in.and midnight and who, under the existing law, closes at 8 pan.and sometimes re-opens at midnight to catch such customers.   It-would also result in  doing  away  with  a number of exemptionsand  in  minimising interference  with  the inherent right of aperson to work for himself.  We have given full consideration to  this proposal.    It  wasfavoured by certain of our number, but believing that if  a per-manent solution of the problem was to be found it was essentialto discover a common ground on which legislation might be based,we have looked for a settlement of the question of shop hours  inother directions.                      IV. CONCLUSIONS. .  17. We are agreed that-a general closing hour for the servingof customers should be adopted and that such closing hour  should
be on the lines of the existing legislation with modifications andshould apply to any shop and to any place not being a shop wherea retail trade or business is carried on.  18. There is a considerable body  of opinion in favour of fixing7 p.m. instead, of 8 p.m. as the general closing hour for shops ondays other than the late day and the  day of the weekly half-holidayand  we are aware that  many shops do in fact close  earlier thanthe hour required by the existing legislation. In view, however,of the provision made  by the  Shops Act, 1912, for obtainingClosing Orders for au earlier hour where a majority of the tradersso desire, as explained in Appendix A, and, having regard to theneed for somewhat later shopping in surburbau areas,  we recom-mend that 8 p.in. should remain as the general closing hour forshops on days other than the late day and  the day of the weeklyhalf-holiday.  Under the Act  of  1920,  shops  are permitted toremain open till 9 p.m. on Saturday, but evidence that Saturdayis not  the most suitable day for later closing in all districts  hasbeen placed before us, and we recommend that the local authorityadministering the Act should be empowered to fix for their areaan alternative to Saturday as the day on which shops may remain open till 9 p.m.  This would tend to meet the  needs of the areaincluding market traders.  19. Our further recommendations are intended as far as pos-sible to remove causes  of controversy while affording  reasonablefacilities for shopping and at the same time to eliminate, at anyrate some of the provisions of the  existing Acts which  makeadministration difficult in regard to mixed shops.   While we thinkthat exemptions from the general Closing Order should be as fewas  possible,  we  recognise  that some must  be  allowed and werecommend that any permanent early closing legislation, whichmay take the place of the Shops Act, 1920 and 1921,  should  not prevent :        (1)  the serving of a customer where it is  proved that the     customer was in the shop before the closing hour or that     reasonable  grounds existed for believing  that  the article     supplied after the  closing  hour to a customer was required     in a case of illness;       (2)  the sale after the closing hour of :             (a) meals or refreshments for consumption on  the         premises; or (in the case  of meals or refreshments sold         on railway premises) for consumption on the trains ;  and         meals or refreshments for  consumption anywhere within         any works premises in the case of canteens attached to         and situated within or in  .the immediate vicinity of the         works, if persons are  employed at such  works after the         closing hour, and the. canteen is kept open only for the         use of such persons;            (b) newly  cooked  provisions  and  cooked  or  partly         cooked tripe to be consumed.off the premises.
           (c) intoxicating liquors to be consumed on or off  the         premises,  in  accordance with the  law relating to  the         sale of intoxicating  liquor for the time being in force.           (d) medicine or medical or surgical appliances, so long         as the shop is kept open only for such time as is neces-         sary for serving the  customer;           (e) newspapers, periodicals and books from the  book-         stalls of such  terminal  and main line stations as may         be approved by the  Secretary of State;           (/) motor, cycle or aircraft supplies or accessories for         immediate use, so long as the shop is kept open only for         such time as  is necessary for serving the customer;           (g) victuals, stores  or other  necessaries required by         any naval, military or Air  Force  authority  for His         Majesty&apos;s forces  or required for any ship on her arrival         at or immediately before her departure from a port, so         long as the shop is  kept open only for such time  as is         necessary  for  serving  the  customer.       (3)  the transaction after the closing hour of any post  office    business.       (4)  sales after the closing hour at any fair lawfully held or    at any bazaar  or  sale of work  for charitable or other pur-    poses  from which no private profit is derived.  20. Lighting of Shops. The necessity for restricting the  useof artificial light no longer exists and  we think that the  provisoin the Act of  1920 that chemists  and  other shops &quot; shall belighted only for such  time as is necessary for serving the cus-tomer &quot;  is unnecessary.    The proviso also places at a dis-advantage  certain classes  of traders  who may desire to use arti-ficial  light for the purpose of display  or advertisement, and  werecommend that it should be discontinued.  21. Fresh Fish,  Raw Tripe  and Soft Fruit. With regard tothe sale  of fresh  fish, raw  tripe and soft fruit, we have hadevidence that in a  large number of  cases shopkeepers  do notavail  themselves of the exemption at  present  allowed and  closetheir  shops entirely at 8  p.m.,  and in a number of towns fish-mongers and fruiterers have obtained local Closing Orders fixingan earlier  hour on several days  of the week.  We consider  fromthe evidence before us that the public obtain little advantage from  this exemption.  We accordingly recommend that it shouldbe discontinued.&apos;  22. Newspapers. The sale  of newspapers  as to which atpresent there is no restriction,  presented some difficulty.   Onthe one  hand, the  National  Federation of Retail Newsagentshave  expressed a desire to have the exemption withdrawn, andwe are satisfied that in its present form it is the cause of evasionof the Act of 1920 in respect of the sale of other articles.  Onthe other  hand, there is a  large  section, of  the  public whichdesires to  purchase  newspapers late in  the  evening and would
                              J3 resent  the withdrawal  of the present facilities  for doing&apos; so. In addition,  we think  it is desirable as a  matter of  national concern that  the free circulation of news should not be unduly interfered with.   After  carefully  considering  all  the  evidence presented to  us by  the  interests  affecled, we recommend that the sale of newspapers in shops  should be subject to the general early closing  provisions but that  their sale in  any place not being a shop should be exempted.   23.  Confectionery. The extension of hours which was granted by the Shops (Early Closing) Act  (1920) Amendment Act, 1921,- added to the  difficulties of administering the Acts by increasing the number  of mixed shops, and one witness averred that it resulted in more  than one-fifth of  the shops which previously closed at S p.m., remaining open till  9.30 p.m. for the sale of fruit and  sweets.    It  would appear that  the  busy  hours  in confectioners  shops differ in various parts of  the country and in different parts of the same local area. The sale of confectionery, especially  in  the  smaller shops,  is  largely a chance or  casual trade when people are out for purposes of recreatior. and pleasure. Many  confectioners have expressed themselves  in  favour  of S o&apos;clock closing, but there is a large number  in certain  areas who have  stated that  they rely for a substantial portion of their takings upon  sales which are made after S p.m.  and claim that the present  hours  be continued.   Shopkeepers  selling  confectionery- stationery have  under the  existing legislation a statutory  right  to keep open to  9.30  p.m.  on weekdays other than Saturdays and 10 p.m. on Saturdays; and in view of the evidence as to a desire of the public for late shopping in confectionery and of the amount of  business done in these shops after 8 o&apos;clock we do  not.feel justified in recommending the right should  be  taken away by- general law in respect of the sale of sugar confectionery, table waters and ice cream.  We therefore recommend  that the present closing hours of 9.30 p.m. and 10 p.m. remain. Simpler facilities than those now in  force should, we think, be afforded for fixing an earlier closing hour.   Confectioners in common with  other traders already may procure a closing order under the  Shops Act, 1912.  V/e had evidence before us that the pnx:edure under that Act is slow and  costly,  and it  seems to us a question  for consideration  whether it would not  be practicable  to introduce a simpler and less  costly procedure for obtaining closing orders generally.  Failing some such amendment of tbe general law, we think that for  the purposes  of the present  case of confectionery- practitioners, a  simpler  method should be  adopted-and we-recom- mend that in  the  event of  a- majority of  confectioners in the area of any   local  authority  under  the Shops  Act,  1912.applying to the  local authority of  that  area  for the  closing of  confectioners&apos;  shops  at  some  hour  earlier  than  9.30  or 10  p.m. (as  the case may  be)  but not  earlier than 8  p.m..the local  authority  should be empowered, on  being satisfiedthat a  majority   of  the traders  concerned  so  desire,  to
make  an Order to  that  effect without  confirmation  by  theSecretary of State.   If an earlier hour than 8 is desired,  applica-tion should be made under the Shops Act, 1912.  The persons entitled to apply to the local authority and to vote on any such application  should be the shopkeepers a substantial part of whose business is the sale  of sugar  confectionery, tablewaters and  ice  cream.   The  object of a provision of this kind is to exclude from voting those shopkeepers whose principal tradeis in some other commodity or commodities and who may stocka small quantity of  such articles in order to remain open to the later hour.  24. Theatres,  &amp;c. We  have given  close  attention to  thequestion  of  the  sale of  confectionery and tobacco in  theatres,cinemas, music  halls and other similar  places of entertainmentafter  the closing hour fixed for shops selling these goods.  Themain objection urged against such sales is that they constituteunfair competition  with the  shops.  We  are,  however, unableto accept the view  that such sales would be injurious  to shop-keepers.   It  would  be a convenience to a large section of thepublic to he able to purchase small  quantities of  these articlesat any time during  the  performance  and no additional  hours oflabour would  be imposed on  the attendants, inasmuch as theyremain on duty whether sales are  permitted or not,  and we re-commend that such sales be allowed.   In making this recom-mendation it is  our  intention  that the sales of confectionery and tobacco in the  places above  mentioned should  be strictly con-fined to bona fide members of the  audience, and that such salesshould not be permitted in any part of the building to  which members of  the public  not attending the performance  have access.  25.  Licensed  Premises. Representations have been  made tous that the sale of  tobacco and matches should be permitted inhotels and other licensed premises to the  limit of  the permittedhours for the sale of intoxicating liquor.  The present hours forthe  sale of intoxicating liquor extend  to one hour,  two hoursor three hours,  according to the licensing area, later than thoseallowed  under the  Shops  Act,  1920; but licensed premises are permitted to sell intoxicating liquor only from  six to nine hours a day, according to the rules of the  licensing district.   Thedifference in the hours of sale of tobacco and intoxicating liquoris a source of inconvenience and irritation  to guests in hotels andother licensed  premises, and an  anxiety  to  the  licensee,  whoconstantly runs the  risk of his Justices&apos;  licence being endangeredon account  of  the  illegal  sale of  tobacco by  the hands of his servants.  Objections on the ground of competition with tobacco- nists&apos; shops have been made to the proposal, but we do not think such sales of tobacco or matches  would be sufficient to do any injury to the shops, and  we recommend that they be allowed. We suggest that the quantity of tobacco or cigarettes to be sold
                             1.1by the licensee  to any  one customer alter  the closing hour fortobacconists&apos; shops should be limited, ard  we understand thatlicensees would  be prepared to accept such  a limitation.  26. Refreshment Houses. Formerly, refreshment  houses inEngland  and Wales were required to bo closed at the same houras premises licensed for  the sale  of intoxicating  liquors byretail, but since 1921 there has  been no hour at which refresh-ment houses are required by law to be closed.   In  scotland the closing hour is regulated under the Burgh Police (Scotland)Acts (&quot;).   In these circumstances we think  that the present  lawin regard to refreshment houses  should  continue, namely, thattobacco  supplied  for  immediate  consumption  at  a  meal bedeemed to form part of the meal and that  the closing hour forother sales  of tobacco on  such premises should be 8 p.m.  and p.m. (as  the  case may be).  27. Tobacconists. The Act of 1920  makes no provision forthe sale  of  tobacco after the  general closing hour except whensupplied  for immediate  consimiption at a meal. We aro satisfiedthat  the inability  to  purchase  tobacco and  cigarettes after8 p.m. has been the cause of irritation on the part of tho public,and  we  have recommended  elsewhere (paragraphs 24 and 25.)that the sale of tobacco should  be permitted to a later hour incertain places.   We do not think that sales of tobacco,  limited in the manner  suggested, would result in  injury to  the trade of tobacconists,  but we  recognise that in some places tobacconistsmay fear competition  and desire to keep  their  shops open toa later  hour than 8  p.m.   We accordingly recommend (thaiiccal authorities should be empowered, on being satisfied  thata two-thirds majority  of the traders concerned  so  desire, tomake an Order  fixing a later  hour, but not later than 9.30 p.m.(10 p.m. on the late night) for the sale of tobacco.   The persons  entitled to apply  to the Jocal authority  and to vote on any such application should be shopkeepers, a substantialportion of whose business is the sale of tobacco.   28.  Exhibitions. Exhibitions are  recognised  as a valuablemethod  of stimulating  trade and are promoted primarily for thepurpose  of  bringing goods before  the  public.   In a properlyconstituted  and organised exhibition sales  are subsidiary to themain purpose and cannot be regarded as competing with the shops.   Indeed, if the  exhibition successfully fulfils its purpose the  demand created will  be  supplied through the shops.  Re-restricted  hours for retail sales are not necessary for the protectionof  assistants inasmuch as they generally work shorter hourswhen  enmloyed at exhibitions  than they do when  employedin shops. The  principle of allowing relaxation from half-holidayclosing provisions in favour of exhibitions has been adopted in the Act of 1912,  and we  think  it  might be  extended to(&apos;) 3 EVHV. VII. CH. 33, 1 &amp; 2 GEO. V. CH. 51.
-evening closing.   We consider that safeguards would be neces-sary  to protect shopkeepers  from  persons  who  might  exploitsuch  a relaxation for their own benefit, and  we recommend that local  authorities be empowered to grant certificates of exemption from  the  evening  closing regulations up to  10  p.m. in caseswhere it is established to their  satisfaction that  retail  trade issubsidiary  or ancillary only to the main  purpr.se  of the  exhibition-tion.   The local authority should be in the case of an  exhibitionto be held  in the City of London, the Common Council: in theCounty of London outside  the  City of  London,  the  LondonCounty Council; in a County Borougb the Town Council for the borough,  and elsewhere the County Council of the County.  29.  Holiday  Resorts, etc. During the  course of the presentInquiry our attention lias been frequently directed  to  the work-ing of the  Early Closing  Order under the Act of  1920 at placesfrequented as holiday resorts.  Many traders in such resorts are dependent  for their living on the business done during  what isknown  as  &quot; the season,&quot; i.e.,  the  period  of the  year duringwhich the  town is frequented by visitors, and some close theirshops entirely during the winter months.  The duration of the&quot; reason &quot; varies in different resorts but  rarely, if ever,  exceedsthree  to four months.  The adoption of &quot; Summer Time &quot; has-acted on shopping at holiday  resorts  and  it was represented that there  is a demand for a lengtliening of shop hours duringthe &quot; season &quot; both  by the  public  frequenting the resorts andthe shopkeepers who are  dependent  on the seasonal trade.  Wethink that the  demand is reasonable and  recommend that itshould be met by empowering local authorities as  defined by the shops Act, 1912, to make Orders fixing  a later closing hour fora limited period not exceeding in the aggregate four months inany year.    We  think  that  the power  so  conferred on localauthorities should be sufficiently wide to enable  them  to fix  alater  closing hour either for all the shops in  their  administrativearea, or specified districts of it, or for particular classes of shopsthroughout the area or in specified districts of it,  and that  theyshould be required to exercise it on being satisfied that a majorityof the shopkeepers concerned desire an Order.  In seaside places where there  is a  &quot; fishing season,&quot; fishermen and others en-gaged in the fishing industry are incommoded by the closing of shops under the Early Closing Order.   A similar power shouldbe  conferred on the local authority in  such  places during the&quot; fishing  season &quot;; such power  to be exercised in  like manneron  the application of the shopkeepers concerned.   We think that special provision should be made in  the Order for the protectionof  shop assistants affected against unduly long hours of  work.  80.  Suspension on Special Occasions. The Act of 1920 makesnrovision  for the suspension  of the General Early Closing Orderby  the Secretary of State for the whole  of England and wales and by the  Secretary  of State  for  Scotland for  the whole of
Scotland during the Christmas season or in connection with anyother special occasion.  The  power is  usually  exercised at theChristinas and New Year seasons, respectively, and we recom-mend that this power  should be continued.   The suspension of the operation of the  Act  of  1920 has lefttraders who have  obtained  Closing  Orders  under the  Act  of1912 in doubt as to what extent  (if any) such suspension affects the provisions  of the  Closing  Orders.  It  was  urged before  us that the  matter should  be made clear in  any  new legislation,and we think that this might be  done.   Our attention has also  been directed to the situation which arose in the Urban District of Wembley on the occasion of theBritish  Empire Exhibition held there in  1923 and 1921, andto situations which  arise from time to time in different localities,us, for example, on race and other local fete days,  when owingto exceptional demands of the  public  the General Closing Orderbecomes almost impossible to enforce.  A  national or generalsuspension  for the  whole country on such occasions is  bothunnecessary and undesirable,  but we recommend that any per-manent early  closing  legislation  should provide for suspensionin particular localities on special occasions by the local authority.Such  suspension should  not  exceed  seven days in any year.Power to suspend  the operation of the General  Early ClosingOrder  for  longer periods  should, we think, be  vested  in theSecretary of State.  31. Mixed Shops: Notice. Much irritation  on  the part  ofshopkeepers and the public and inanj&apos; administrative difficulties have been due to- the &quot; mixed shops &quot; in which the sale of somearticles is illegal at times when  the shop  is lawfully  open forthe sale of other articles.  The Regulation under subsection  (i)of Section 10  of the Shops Act,  1912,  requires the occupier  ofa &quot; mixed shop &quot; which is kept open  on the weekly half holidayto display a notice stating that the shop is &quot; closed except forthe trade or business of ..................,&quot; and it has been urgedbefore us that administration would be simplified and both shop-keepers and the public assisted in observing the law if  a similarrequirement were made in respect of evening closing.  We there-fore recommend that  the  occupier of a mixed shop  should  berequired to  display, after the earliest closing hour affecting hisshop, a notice  specifying the  articles for the sale of which the shop is open.  We think the notice would be more effective if the  form adopted were :  &quot; This shop  is  open  only for thesale of ..................&quot;  32. Enforcement. The Shops  Early Closing Orders  are  atpresent administered bv the local authorities which administer the Shops Act, 1912.  &quot;The Shops Acts of 1912  and 1913 andthose of 1920  and 1921  are  thus administered by one body,namely, the local authority.  It has been represented to us that more  effective  enforcement, of the closing provisions  could  besecured by the  Police than by inspectors under local authorities,
ISon the ground that frequently inspectors are not on duty at or afterthe statutory closing hour, and are not, therefore, in so favour-able a position to detect infringements of the law as the police-men  patrolling  the  streets.  This  is  no  doubt often true; butthere are many objections to the police being employed on this duty, and  several witnesses  objected to the  transfer or enforce-ment to  the police authorities.   We think that no case has beenmade out for any change  in the existing law, and that in any new legislation  the administration should be vested in the localauthority.  33. Penalties.-It has been  represented to us  by several wit-nesses that the penalties imposed for infringements of the  ShopsActs  are often insufficient to prevent the repetition of offences,and that many shopkeepers,  notwithstanding convictions, gain a financial advantage  from  breaches  of the  law.   The penalties for offences under the Shops Acts,  1920 and 1921, are the  sameas for offences  under the Shops Act, 1912, being for  a firstoffence a fine not exceeding  1; for  a second offence not exceed-ing ,- 5;  for  a third or  subsequent  offence  not exceeding .- 20.The  complaint  appeared to  be that  tha fines  imposed by theCourt were in the opinion of the witnesses who appeared beforeus not sufficiently heavy.  The amount of the fine is within the discretion of  the Court.  We consider that no case for increasingthe maximum amount of the fine has been established.  34. Ice  Cream Shops  (Scotland). Our  attention has  been called to a class of shops common in Scotland in which are soldtemperance drinks, confectionery, ice cream and tobacco,  some-times called  &quot; ice cream shops.&quot;   The occupiers  of these shopsare entitled to register their premises as places for public refresh-ment under the provisions of the Burgh Police (Scotland)  Acts,1903-11, thereby acquiring the right,  subject to Orders made bythe local authority,  to remain open later than  8 p.m. for thesale of refreshments for consumption on the premises.   It  iscomplained that the occupiers of these shops are guilty of  illegalsales of  tobacco and confectionery after the closing hours  forshops and  that some of them become undesirable places of resortfor young  persons.   Under the Burgh  Police (Scotland) Acts, provisions or refresh-nients of any kind (including confectionery,  ice cream, fruit andaerated  waters)  cannot  be sold in  an &apos;* ice cream shop &quot;  forconsumption on the premises  after  S p.m. or before  5  a.m. onweekdays, or at any time on  Sundays, unless the  premises areregistered as a place for public refreshment.   Once registered as a place for public refreshment they becomesubject to any bye-laws which the Town Council may have made or may  make  for regulating the hours of opening and  closingsuch  premises.  Such bye-laws may restrict the hours of business to not less than fifteen hours daily, except on Sunday, when thebye-laws may provide for total or partial  closing.
  These provisions of  the  Burgh  Police  Acts with respect toplaces for public refreshment in Scotland are in addition to, auddo not derogate from, the provisions of the  Shops Acts, which arerequired also to be observed.  It therefore appears  that powers already exist  for regulating the conduct of these shops, and the subject of further regulation,if required, would be more appropriate  under the Burgh PoliceActs  than under  new  legislation  dealing with  the closing of shops.  35. Sunday Trading. We have not excluded evidence of theextent to which Sunday trading is carried on.  Some witnessesurged that shops should  be closed on Sundays while otherspressed for an  extension of hours.   We do not,  however,  con-sider  that the subject of Sunday  trading comes within our termsof reference, and make no recommendation with  regard to it.  3G. Hours of  Shop Assistants. The question of the statutorylimitation  of the  hours of employment of  shop assistants, as distinct  and apart from  the compulsory  closing  of shops, hasbeen  raised before us.   We have taken the view that the subject is  not one that  comes within our terms of reference, and make no  recommendation  with regard  to it.  37. Automatic Machines. These machines have for  manyyears been in  common use by  tobacconists,  confectioners andothers.   It was urged before us  that the legal position as to theuse of these machines  after the general closing  hour for shopsshould be defined in any new legislation.   The operation of these machines during the period in which shops  are  required to be closed for serving customers has  been held by the High Court inEngland(a) not  to be a breach of the law.  Tt seems to  us thatthe law  in this respect  is sufficiently defined.  We had evidence before us that children  (i.e., persons under 16) make use of these machines to obtain  cigarettes: but the evil does not appear atpresent to be very widespread.   38. Auctions. It was represented that  a hardship was caused to  auctioneers and the  public by the stoppage of  bona fide  salesby auction in  auction  rooms  at the same  hours as shops arerequired  to  be  closed,  and that such  auction sales should be excluded from  the  operation  of the Shops Acts.   Under thepresent  law no sales by auction  may  take  place after closing hour except sales by auction of private effects in a private dwell-ing house.  We do not think that a case for  any alteration ofthe law in this  respect has been established.   39. General. In  the  event  of  legislation   being  carried through covering the points herein indicated, it will be unneces-sarv  to continue anv of the provisions of the Shops (Early Clos-inrrl  Acts.  1920 and 1021.    These  Acts should, therefore, be allowed to lapse,  and the special meanings given to various ex-prescions in them should no lontrer operate.  Under the present            (&apos;) WiHesden T7.0-.C. v. Morgan, 1915, I.K.H.  3-19.          &quot;
provisions, for example,  &quot; refreshments &quot; are  not deemed toinclude &quot; sweets, chocolate,  or other sugar confectionery or icecream.&quot;   The reason  for definitions of this nature no  longerexist,  and  such definitions  in  any  new  legislation  will  be unnecessary.

                             22.        MEMORANOM  BY MR.  L.  HORE-BELISHA, M.P.  I have  signed this Report with  reluctance and only becauseno better method  was disclosed in evidence  to your Committeeof safeguarding  the welfare of  shop) assistants.  But T cannotregard the principle of the fixing of  closing hours for shops  asbeing one that  automatically safeguards the interests of shop assistants.  Moreover,  the exceptions  to the general  principlethat we have been compelled  to make  still leave large numbersof these workers completely unprotected.  I consider that thehours and conditions of work of employees  in retail  trades are matters for a  substantive  investigation  which, being a  more direct  method  of approach, might indicate a  less  anomaloussolution of the  problem which confronted us.                                     LESME HORE-BELISHA.       MEMORWDCM  BY MRS. HILTON  PHILIPSON,  M.P.  I  regret that I am in disagreement with my colleagues.   have signed the Report subject to this  reservation,  because  i recognise that it contains many good points, and I would rather that they should receive the  attention of the Home secretary and Parliament than  that  the  whole of  the  results of ourexhaustive  Inquiry should become  abortive and  the present&quot; D.O.R.JA.&quot; legislation continued.  I think the small  shopkeeper should be encouraged and thathis  hours for doing  business should  not be restricted.   Manywidows and single women and ex-service men are small shop-keepers.    I  know that many ex-service  men are  now shop assistants and doing well, and support  the movement  for closingall shops  at a certain hour lest their hours of  duty be lengthened.I have no wish to see the  hours of shop assistants lengthened.On  the contrary, I should like to see them adjusted to  a fair and reasonable  period.  What  I do fear is that the extensionof  the  large shop, multiple shop and  co-operative  store (all ofwhom  favour restricted hours  for shopping) .will  result in theultimate  elimination of the small shop.    This will close the door to many assistants starting business on their  own account. Suppose  an assistant has reached .the later years of life and has- to give way for younger men.   What is to happen to him if you take away his  only chance of starting  business  on his own?The small shopkeeper is an important factor in keeping down the cost of commodities.  In  many  districts  the small shop- keepers  only chance of a profitable return is his takings towards the end  of the  day and after the big  shops have closed.  Why should he not be allowed to work if he wishes to? -  He injures no one and he  benefits at least a section of the public.   In  my  opinion  the  Shops Acts,  1920-21,  including  the D.O.R.A.  restrictions, ought  to be  discontinued, and if it is necessary to regulate  the hours of  shop assistants  that  should be done as a separate measure, and if it is desired in any district
(o obtain early closing for shops, ibis can be obtained  underthe procedure laid down in the Shops Act, 1912.  Alternatively,1 think that it should  be made law  that no shop assistants beemployed after,  say, 8 p.m., aud after, say, 9  p.m., on  latenights, and  that the  Shops  Acts,  1920-21,  be discontinued.This would enable the shop assistant to get away at  the closing hour and would not prevent the shopkeeper carrying on his busi-ness in his own way until such hour as he should close.  I am glad to think that some of my colleagues supported this view.  \Tt may be said that  the  &apos;* bulk &quot; of the  evidence is againstboth  views.    The  bulk of  the evidence was,  however,  theevidence of &quot; organised &quot; bodies  and only  a percentage of  theshopkeepers of the country is organised.  It cannot be assumed that the evidence of organised bodies is representative of  theshopkeepers of the country or of the  public.   The  number of independent  persons (as  distinct from organised bodies) whogave evidence was limited, but the weight of their evidence was greater than that of the  &quot; organised &quot; evidence and supportedgenerally  the  opinions I have endeavoured  to  express.                                         MABEL PHILIPSON.     MEMORANDUM  BY  MR.  JAMES  STEWART,  M.P., AND                 MR. P.  A. TAYLOR, M.P.  We  find ourselves in complete agreement  with the  rest of  our colleagues as to the necessity for permanent legislation embody-ing the principle of compulsory  closing  of  shops.   In general we support the majority of their conclusions, but feel  compelled,after the most careful consideration, to dissent from the majorityof our colleagues in the  recommendations  they have made inparagraphs 23, 24, 25, 27 and 29 of their report.  We feel very strongly that one of the principal difficulties in the administra-tion  of the 1920  and  1921 Acts  has been the different  timesfixed by law for the sale of different commodities, and we con-sider that the principle governing any variation of the generalclosing hours  should be that  such variation should  only  applyto emergenc3r  requirements    While we recognise  that  theremay be n strong desire in certain quarters for extended  hours for  the sale of confectionery,  we do not consider that confectionery-stationery comes  within  the   above  category.    If,  however,extended facilities for the sale of confectionery should  be con-templated, we  are  strongly  of  opinion  that the  machineryproposed in paragraph  23  is based upon an entirely indefensibleprinciple.    We   consider  that  Confectionery  Trade  should conform  to the  general principle of 8 o&apos;clock closing, exceptin those cases where  the local  conditions are such that thisclosing hour would cause  real hardship and inconvenience.  Inevidence given before us it was stated that  only about one-fifth of the  shops, which  prior to the Amendment Act of 1921 were compelled to  close at S  0&apos;clock,  had  taken advantage of  the
 extension of  the hour to 9.30.  Under these circumstances, we believe  that  any  proposed  legislation  should  only  allow an extension beyond  8 p.m. where  a two-thirds  majority  of the local traders vote in favour of such extension.  We would point out at this stag&quot;  that if the recommendations with  regard to Confectionery Trades and  the Tobacco  Trades contained  in paragraph 27 arc  adopted, there will be two entirely different principles embodied in the same  Act of Parliament.  In  the case  of  the Confectionery Trade, 9.30 closing would  be general unless a majority  of  shopkeepers  vote for earlier hours, whilst in the case of Tobacconists the 8 o&apos;clock closing would be general except where the  traders vote for later hours.  As many shops sell both sweets and tobacco and  most of  the difficulties and irritation arise from the fact  that  a shop whilst  open may be allowed  to sell  one  commodity but  not another,  we feel it imperative that a uniform closing hour and also a. uniform method of  deciding what the closing hour shall be, should  operate for both  Trades.  Paragraph 24 proposes to extend the sale of confectionery and tobacco  in theatres,  cinemas,  music halls   and  other similar places of entertainment  after the closing hour fixed  for shops selling these  goods.   We do not consider that  any substantial evidence of a public demand for  this change in the law has been placed before the Committee.  Further, we do not consider that preferential treatment of this character  should be  given to a class of  Traders in these commodities for whom such  trading is merely subsidiary  to their main occupation  of providing enter- tainment, and that it  gives them an advantage over competitors who  are solely dependent upon  such sales for their  livelihood. We are  also of the opinion that the proposal  to give preferential treatment to places of entertainment will lead to  a demand for extended hours on the  part of  tobacconists and  confectioners. We are satisfied that no serious public inconvenience or irritation arises from the present state of the  law  in  respect of sales of confectionery  and tobacco in theatres, cinemas and music halls, the public having accommodated themselves  to the present con- ditions.   We  are of the opinion that no case  has been  made out for this change.  The proposals made in paragraph 25 for the extension of hours for  the sale of tobacco and matches in hotels and other licensed premises to the limit  of the permitted hours for the sale of in- toxicating liquors is in our opinion unnecessary, and will  create further dissatisfaction  and irritation.  It appears to us that the placing of automatic machines inside licensed premises for the sale of tobacco,  cigarettes  and  matches would  meet  any  realpublic demand.   It would at the  same time avoid the feelingamongst  tobacconists  that the  later  hours of sale in licensed premises was a source of unfair competition.   The proposal madein paragraph  25, if embodied  in legislation,  would create  this anomaly  that  whereas in refreshment  houses, temperance bars
and  temperance hotels it would be illegal to sell tobacco andmatches after 8 oVlock, it would be possible to obtain the samecommodities  in licensed premises at a much later  hour.   If onthe other  hand the same  facilities  were granted to temperancebars and  refreshment  houses,  it  would  be regarded  by thetobacconists as further unfair competition, and would provide anadditional incentive  for demanding late  closing hours  for theTrade  generally   with  consequent  extension  of  hours  fortobacconists and their assistants, which arc at present  not de-sired by employers and employed alike.  If the same facilitiesfor the sale of tobacco were extended to refreshment houses asthose proposed  to  be given  to licensed premises, it would per-petuate and increase difficulties of administration  that arise from having different legal  hours for the sale  of different  classes of commodities, and  in the  larger restaurants might lead  to theestablishment of tobacco stalls at which purchases could be madelong after the  hours at which tobacconists were  compulsorilyclosed.  The recommendations in paragraph 29, which  propose to give to local  authorities  in holiday resorts power to  suspend theGeneral Closing Order for four months of the year, are, in ouropinion, not  required by the general public.  We  have had no evidence of any considerable  public demand for this suggestedchange in the law.  We regard the suggested power to suspendin specific districts which need not necessarily mean the whole area of the local authority as being a vicious principle.  We feelthat this recommendation if carried into effect will undoubtedlyincrease the working hours for large numbers of shop assistants,many of whom  are  seasonal workers  who  derive no  advantage from the  provision in the  1912 Act that they should be given a  fortnights holiday in lieu  of the abolition of  their weeklyhalf-holiday,  and  in view of  the absence  of any  definite legalprotection  against excessive hours  of labour we cannot assent to a proposal which may  have the  effect  of  imposing undulylong  hours on large  numbers  of  young  persons and  women workers.   We wish to emphasise the fact  that the restricted terms  ofreference  embodied in the Minute of Appointment of this Com-mittee have  prevented the  Committee from making a full and comprehensive  survey of  the  whole field  of  Shops Actslegislation.   In our opinion,  any new legislation should provide for a statu-tory limitation of the hours of work  of shop assistants to notmore than 48 per  week.JAS. STEWART.B. A. TAYLOR.

Notice of intention  tomake an Order lias to bo  given by means of newspaper and poster adver-tisement, and  a  period of four weeks  allowed  within  which objectionsmay bo lodged.   If the local  authority, after  considering any objectionsor suggestions received,  desire  to  proceed with the Order,  they  mustascertain whether the occupiers  of at least two-thirds in  number of the shops to be effected approve  the Order, either by  taking  a vote in themanner provided in the Regulations, or if they have received a  petitionfor the  Order, by verifying the signatures to the petition.   Every ClosingOrder hits to bo confirmed by the Secretary of State, and when the localauthority have made such an Order,  notice thai it has been made and submitted  to  the Secretary  of  State  must be given in  the prescribedmanner and a further period of one month  allowed for making objections.In submitting  the  Order  to  the Secretary of  State,  tho local authority is required  to inform  him as to  the  method  adopted for ascertaining the opinion of occupiers  of shops  and to forward to him  evidence thatthe Regulations have been duly  complied with.  Tho -Secretary of  state is empowered either to disallow an  Order or to confirm it with or  without.amendment; and  after an Order has  been confirmed  it  must  bo laidbefore  Parliament  for -10  sitting days,  during which either House maypetition  for its annulment.

APPENDIX C.                       Summary or Evidence,  For  purposes  of convenience in  considering  the  evidence which  was.placed before  us we divided tho witnesses  into  broad  classes as follows:(1)  those representing the general body  of  retail  shopkeepers; (2) thoserepresenting particular  trades;&apos; (3)  witnesses  on bclialf  of authoritiesadministering the Acts;  (-1) witnesses  representing  shop  assistants;  (5)witnesses representing the general public.                 (1) The  General  ISody of Shopkeepers.  Tho  Early Closing Association  which  kas between  50,000 and 60,000subscribers  and  claims  to represent  all  traders throughout  tho  countryand shop  assistants gave evidence  in  support of the continuance on apermanent  basis of  tlio  Shops Act, 1020, and the repeal of the  Act of]921.  In&apos; the view of that Association late shopping was merely a  badhabit on the part of the  public and was unnecessary.  It inflicted greathardship on both shopkeepors and assistants and was  a fruitful causeof ill-health.  Early closing was not to ibe regarded as tho survival of war conditions  but the result of the gradual &quot; education  &quot;  of the public inbetter habits, and when in 1916 compulsion came  tho  country was foundto bo ready for it and had in some measure anticipated it, and experience showed that tho  public had not been inconvenienced.  Small shopkeeperswelcomed  early  closing  as emancipation from the  &quot; shop slavery &quot; whichhad previously been  their lot.  The success of shopkeepers of all classesdepends on their satisfying the demands of their customers and. S p.in.had proved sufficiently late for the public to obtain all that it required.Prolongation of  the hours of distribution did not bring about increasedsales and no serious decrease  in profits had been experienced as a resultof closing early.  The public would not be seriously  inconvenienced if allshops  were closed at S  p.m.  Tho Association  considered tliat  most ofthe opposition to early closing was due to the anomalies which  existedunder the present law and which were mainly created  by tho Act  of  1921permitting tho sale of certain commodities after the general closing hour.They felt that there would be materially less dissatisfaction if the  act of  1921 were  repealed but would rather it should remain than lose tho1920 Act as well. The witness laid stress on the difficulty of conductinga shop selling a variety of  articles  some of  which  might be sold  at alater hour  than others.   Such  an arrangement led to confusion in. the mind  of the  public  and was  embarrassing  to  the  shopkeeper who  wastempted to break tho law to  oblige a customer.  It was undesirable that shops which were conducted without assistantsshould  keep open to a later hour  than those in which assistants were employed;  the objection to that system being that it  would  be unfair tothe small shopkeeper who employed only one or two  assistants and  who could  not afford to close  while his neighbour  remained open.  The Asso-ciation was opposed to any form of shift system  as  being impracticablein  retail trade.  It would be  difficult  to administer,  it  would interferewith the outdoor recreation of assistants,  would tend  to reduce wagesand increase  overhead charges which would  in turn  increase the priceof  all commodities  to  the consumer.    After 30 years&apos; experience thewitness regarded voluntary agreements to  close early  as  useless.   Hewould allow nothing except emergency  medicine and fried fish to  bo  soldafter 8 p.m.  The sale of tobacco  and sweets in theatres after the. closing hour for shops engaged in similar trado -was unfair to the shops whichdepended for their living on the sale of those commodities.  No extensionof  hours should  be  allowed at seaside resorts unless the  majority of theshopkeepers in the town  desired it.  Tho National  Chamber of  Trade,  which  includes  some  350  traders&apos;associations, having a membership in excess of 100,000 retail shopkeepersin  all  parts  of  England and  &quot;Wales,  was  emphatic in  approving  the
principle of compulsory closing of all shops  at  prescribed hours on each day of  the week.  Witnesses on  behalf of the  Chamber contended thatthe fact that  tho General  Early  Closing  Order  was  made  under  theDefence of the Realm Regulations and had its  origin in war conditions,should  not be used  to create prejudice against  it.  After more than ten years&apos;  experience of the working  of the Order  there  was an over-whelming majority in every class of trade and in all kinds of districts in favour  of a  permanent statute  incorporating  its most  importantfeatures.  They were unaware that any responsible or representative bodyentitled to speak for cither shopkeepers, shop assistants  or  the publichad  ever put forward  n claim for  the abandonment of the compulsoryprinciple.  Retailers, being in such  close  touch  with  the public, were inan  unique  position  to ascertain its  wishes and could  not  afford  to disregard them.  The convenience of the public  was their first consider, i-tion,  yet the majority of shopkeepers desired  compulsory  closing to  bemade   permanent.   The  Chamlior considered  that   exemptions  andexceptions  should be reduced  to  a minimum, but  would be prepared toaccept  the provisions  of  the  Act  of  1021  lest something  worse  shouldtake  its place.   Tho  Chamber urged  that  any fresh  legislation  shoprovide for the  making  of  Closing  Orders  fixing  an earlier  hour than p.m.  in  any trade or  district  where a  representative demand  for  an earlier  hour  existed,  but  agreed  that  the fixing  of  the compulsoryclosing  hour earlier  than 8 p.m. would  greatly inconvenience both  the traders and  the public  in  some  districts. Dealing  with exemptionsthe witness agreed that certain commodities would have to  be exempted,but  did not  agree  to special  treatment  being accorded to exceptional cases.   It  was the  considered  opinion  of the  Chamber that  all places where  retail trade  was carried on  should  be compelled to observe  the closing  hour and no latitude whatever should be  given to persons carryingon  business in  places  other  th-m  actual  shops.  This included  fairs,bazaars and sales by itinerant vendors.   The sale of tobacco and sweetsin theatres was  objected  to on account of  the unfair  competition  withshops,  and they  thought that  such sales  should be prohibited  altogetherafter the shops outside were closed.  Dealing with the alleged  failure ofsmall shops carried  on  by the  proprietor  without  assistance and  thesuggestion  that  they  should  be exempted,  the  witness said that   hisorganisation included a  substantial number of small traders,  and after making specific  inquiry on  the point they could find no evidence of ex-service  men  and  other small shopkeepers being  unable to make a living  owing  to compulsory  closing.  On  the contrary  these   traderssupported  the policy of the Chamber which  was opposed to the granting of any exemption in such cases.  The penalties  usually imposed underthe Act were too small and might with advantage be  increased.  The Retail Traders&apos; section of  the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce,representing directly about 200 retail  shopkeepers and through affiliatedassociations  a very large body of traders of all  classes, gave evidencecorroborating  generally  that  given by  the Early  Closing association and  the  National Chamber of  Trade.    Tlie  witness  said it  was  thegeneral experience  of the whole of the  members of the  Section  thatthe  Shops  (Early Closing) Acts had conferred  an  inestimable  benefitupon  retail  traders  and  they  were convinced   that  any substantial modification of the measure of protection which  the Acts  afforded both to  assistants and  to the proprietors  themselves would be deplored  byan  overwhelming majority.  Tho Section whidh represented all branchesof  the  retail  distributive trade  recognised that the  circumstances  ofsome trades might warrant the  application of closing hours differingsomewhat  from  the hours prescribed  by  the  present  Acts,  but they thought that no modification  of the prescribed hours should  be  allowedexcept  on  the representation of  a substantial majority  of the particularbranch of trade concerned.   They  advocated the fixing  of the  closing hour nationally  with  local option  to extend.   The witness  recognised    ti*7tis                                                         B
that small shopkeepers were  in  tho  main unorganised  and consequentlyinarticulate, but  said  that  it  was  the  experience  of  his organisation,which  included small and suburban shopkeepers,  that the desire for thecontinuance of statutory closing was  shared  by  the great  majority ofthe smaller traders.  It had been  found that the  shortening of  hoursdiil not  reduce the volume  of. trade and  it  was the  experience of hisOrganisation that the public had acquired the habit of shopping earlierso that  there was now no desire  for  shops  to remain open later  than3 p.m.   He was certain that if  any such desire existed they as traders,whose  business it  was  to satisfy their customers,  would  be  aware of it.He was  unaware  of any public  demand for later hours lor the sale of tobacco  either  in  shops or in places of. amusement, and had  heard nocomplaints  against  the present restrictions even by  the managers ofamusement  houses,  a  number of  whom he knew,   (jiving  evidence onthe question of retail  sales  at  exhibitions,  the witness said that manyol&quot; the exhibitions held had  no  other object, than  that  of  making money for the  promoters,  and  the shopkeepers  were opposed to  retail  salesbeing  allowed at  times when they were required to be closed.  It wasunfair competition.  Instances of  the  methods  adopted  by exhibitionsto  evade the  Act were  given.   Speaking  on  the  enforcement of theActs,  the witness  said  that  his  Organisation  thought  that the adniinis-trntion of the Acts should  be entrusted to  the  police.  He  explainedthat they did not wish the police to enforce the Act of  1912, and agreedthat &apos;tho presence of  a uniformed man  in  the shop during businesshours  was  undesirable,  but  the  police who were familiar  with thedistrict  were best  able  to  detect evasion of the  closing  regulations.The shift system  in shops had  been tried  in Birmingham,  manchester and Liverpool and had been  found  impracticable, easily  evaded  and costly.   Longer hours  did not  result  in more trade;  they  would  onlyspread it over a longer period.  The London  and Suburban  Traders&apos; Federation,   which  comprises48  retail   traders&apos; organisations  with  an  aggregate  membership  of10,000  shopkeepers, the  majority  of  whom  own  one-man  businesses,gave  evidence  generally supporting that given by the  National Chamberof  Trade to which  it  is affiliated.   Tho witness said that when  earlyclosing  became   compulsory   traders  in   London   and  its  suburbswelcomed the innovation and were  now strongly  in favour  of all shops,except  those for  the   sale of  refreshments,  being  closed at  the  samehour,  which should not  be  later  than  8  p.m, except on one night  ofthe  week  when an extra hour  would  be  required:   Voluntary efforts to secure earlier closing had proved  ineffective, as there were  always oneor  two  shopkeepers who relused to be  parties to the  agreement.    Nofalling  off  of business as  the result  of   shortened   hours  had   been observed, and  a general Closing Order  for the whole  country would  bemore  satisfactory than  local Orders  which  affected  particular  tradesbecause  of  the  difficulty which  arose  in regard  to  mixed shops.    Con-fectioner-tobacconists   were   in  a  great difficulty   under  the present law and particularly  desired  a  uniform closing  hour.    The  general opinion  of  the  members of  the Federation was  that  exemptions shouldbe  reduced to a  minimum,  and some had  gone so far  as  to  urge that none  should  be allowed except in respect  of refreshment  places, andthey  would exclude sweets and  ice cream from the  expression &quot; xefresh-ments.&quot;    Pressed  as to the  practicability  of  such  a rigid rule,  thewitness  agreed that the sale of medical and surgical  appliances  wouldhave  to be  exempted and through  that serious   consideration   wouldrequire  to be  given   to the sale of  motor  and cycle supplies.   Theevidence of this  witness  differed   from that  given on &quot;behalf of  other organisations  of  general  traders  on  the   subject  of  retail sales  atexhibitions  after  the  general  closing  hour  for shops in  that he ex-pressed  the opinion  that exhibitions under proper  authorities  might be allowed to  have some  special consideration.   He  also thought there
would be uo objection to sales of confectionery  and tobacco in theatresafter the  shops were closed,  but  distinguished  these  sales  from  thesale of  tobacco  iu  public houses after tobacconists  were closed.    on being  informed  that  the organised tobacconists  were op]K)sed to  suchsales being  permitted,  he said  his  Federation  would  support them.He  thought  that  the  inspectorate  should  be  somewhat increased  ieLondon  owing  to  the large area  to  be  covered,  but was  opposed  tothe  duty being placed on tho  police.                         (2)  Particular  Trades.  Confectionery. The  London  Confectioners&apos; Association gave evidence in  support of  the continuance  oi&quot; the- existing hours  for  tho sale  ofconfectionery  on week-days,  but urged strongly that, in order to meetthe  needs of  the  public, the  closing  hour  on   -Sundays  should  bo9.30  p.m.   If  the sale  of  confectionery  were  permitted  ia theatresand other  places  of  amusement to any later  hour, the  shops wouldrequire  to  ke&amp;p open  to the  same hour in order  to  meet  the  coin-petition  that  would  arise.   The Association were strongly opposed  toany  mrther  restriction,  and  the  witness  produced figures   obtainedduring  the  preceding  fortnight, showing,  for  representative districtsiu different  parts  of  London,  that  the takings after 8  p.m.   averagedover 30 per cent, of  the total for the day.   This information  had beengathered  from the smaller type  of shop.   The  average  weekly takingswere about  20. and 90 per cent, of  tho shops  employed  no assistants.There  were  no  figures  available as  to  the  value  to the  traders  con-corned of the  increased one-and-a-half  hours  allowed  under  the  act of  1921,  but  he  estimated  that  the amount  of business done  had increased  by  about  25  per cent.,  and  stated  that  even  now abojut50 per cent, of the confectionery businesses in London were  not paying.Sales of  confectionery were always chance  ones dependent  on  inomen-tary  impulse,  and  confectioners  could  do  business  only when people were out for  purposes of recreation in the evening.   He was satisfiedthat if hours  were further restricted sales would be  materially reduced and  S o&apos;clock  closing would ruin  50 per cent, of confectioners.    Allprevious   legislation had  provided  exceptional  treatment for   the  con-fectionery trade, and  it  would  be  impossible  for  it  to carry on  suc-cessfully  if compelled  to close  earlier than  at  present.  The Federated Confectioners&apos; Association of  the  United Kingdom,which comprises all branches of tho trade including manufacturers,  andthe National Union of Retail Confectioners&apos; Associations, having a mem-membership of 1,500, was substantially in  agreement  with  that  given onbehalf of the London  Association. They urged that the hours  of closingon  weekdays  should  not be earlier  than  those fixed at present  and pressed for an extension  to 9.30 p.m. on Sundays.   Their representative,speaking  of areas outside the London area,  said  that the bulk of their trade was done  after 6.30 p.m., and sales not  effected  then  could not be done  at any other  time,  and to close earlier than they were requiredto at present would  ruin the  majority  of confectionery  retailers.   the extensive use now  made of automatic machines showed  the  need therewas  for  remaining open late.   Figures  were given showing,  for shopsin  various parts of  England  north  of Manchester,  that the averagetakings  between 6 p.m.  and 9.30 p.m.  were over  70 per cent, of theday&apos;s total, and the bulk of the trade was between 8 p.m. and  9.30 p.m.The witness did  not think more than about  2 in 60 confectioners closedtheir shops at 8 p.m.   If there  was such a&quot; demand  for earlier closingas some had represented, recourse would have been had to Closing orders under  the Act of 1912.   It would be wrong to close  shops compulsorilywhen such closing would ruin the proprietors. Assistants in  the confectionery-stationery trade  were satisfied with the  present  hours.  Owing to  thepractice  of opening late and allowing time off  they worked  only about.50 hours per week, and in addition received extra  payment  for Sunday    64768                                                        B 2
 lul)our.  If the closing hour was fixed at 8 o&apos;clock, a number of assistants would lose their  jobs.  The work of an  assistant  in the confectionery trade was  easier thai  that of any  other retail assistant, and he  was not aware  of any movement on the part  of the assistants to  obtain  a further  restriction of hours.  The witness did not agree that the exten- sion  of  hours  under  the  Act  of  15)21  was  obtained us  the result of pressure from  interests controlling theatres and cinemas,  but said  they were granted  in  response  to a  very general demand for longer  hours on the part of the  trade.   It  was  not  his  experience that  the  eating of  sweets  was  a habit like  the  smoking of tobacco,  and if people could not buy  confectionery  at  the moment  when they  felt  a desire  for it they  went  without  it.   The Manchester and  District  Retail Confectioners&apos; Association, which represents 425 memliers  including two multiple  firms, gave evidence in support  of the  demand for the continuance  of the existing hours  with extension  to 9.30  p.m. on Sundays, and  protesting  against  any  con- cession being granted to places  of amusement.  Speaking of the import- ance  to their  trade of the extra one and half  hours on Sunday,  the witness said that when the Act of  1921 was passed  a good  many  con- fectioners  remained open  till  9.30 p.m. on Sundays,  hut  when,  as  the result of a decision in  the  High Court,(&quot;)  they  were compelled to close at  S  p.m., the average drop in  the Sunday takings of  10  shops was 35 per cent.  He also gave  figures showing the hours  and  wages  of assistants  and  the takings of shops  for  the purpose  of showing that a curtailment of the  present hours would  result in serious financial loss to  all confectioners,  and absolute ruin to  many.   The majority of  con- fectioners&apos; shops were  one-man businesses,  and under  the  present  regu- lations experienced difficulty in  making  a living.   The Shops  Act, 1921, came into operation  on the 19th August,  1921, and the witness showed that  the  takings  in  his shop  for  the four weeks immediately  after  the 19th  August increased 21  per  cent, over the  takings for the four weeks immediately preceding the  19th  August.  Similar evidence was  given  by an  individual confectioner carrying on a  high class trade at Richmond, Surrey, and by  a  commercial  traveller calling on small confectioners  in the  Midlands.  On  the other hand,  the witness representing the Birmingham Chamberof  Commerce said  that,  although his organisation  did not include  thesmall  sweetshops, lie  knew from  personal experience  that quite a number of  these shops would l)e glad to close earlier but were forced to keep open  by the competition  of those w-ho  refused  to  close.  He  knew  ofsome  confectioners who said that it did not pay them to keep  open, and of  others  who voluntarily  closed.  The  National Federation  of  Retail Newsagents, Booksellers and  Stationers   canvassed  G53  confectioneryshops, representing  all classes of  the trade in  main  thoroughfares andside streets in Birmingham, with the following results:  In favour of reverting to 8 o&apos;clock  weeknights and 9 p.m.  Saturday  closing      ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...   408In favour of present hours    ...    ...     ...     ...     ...   131Doubtful    ........................    31Women in favour, but would  not sign as their  husbands  were out  ...    ...    ...    ...    ...    ...     ...     ...    19Shopkeepers out when call was made  ...     ...     ...     ...    23In favour of 9 p.m. closing  nightly   ...     ...     ...     ...    41  The London  and Suburban Traders&apos;  Federation said  that cciiiectioner-tobacconists  were in a  great difficulty  owing to  the  difference in thehours  of  sale  for the  two  commodities and desired  uniform 8  p.m.closing.  The confectioners among their  members would be content with8 p.m. as the closing time for their shops.(&quot;) L.C.C. v. Gainsborough [1923] 2 K.B. 301.
                                   67   The National Chamber of Trade said that confectioners  would welcome the  abolition  of the 1921  Act, and contended  that  sweets  were not  at present extensively purchased  ufter  8 p.m.  The feeling of the Hair- dressers&apos;  Federation was against extended hours being allowed  for the salo of confectionery.   An individual confectioner-tobacconist carrying mi  business at Isling- ton, about one-third of whose  trade  was confectionery, said his experi- ence was  that  such  businesses as his could  bo closed at S p.m. (10 p.m. on Saturdays)  without  inconvenience  to  the public.   Very little business was done  in confectionery after 8 p.in. and that business  would be  done earlier if  tho  public knew  the  shops would be closed  at that&apos; hour.  He denied that small shopkeepers  could  close when they pleased,  and said that their hours had to be fixed in accordance  with  those of their  eom- competitors.  Ho  also expressed  the  opinion that  the sale of tobacco and confectionery  was  not  tho  business  of theatres and  cinemas and  they should not be  allowed to sell in competition with shopkeepers who relied on the salo of  these articles for their living.   The  National Union  of  Retail Tobacconists,  in  tho  course  of their evidence,  stated  that  they  had recently taken steps to  ascertain  the views of the confectionery trade and gave it as their opinion that SO per cent of confectioners would  like compulsory closing at  8 p.m.  and 9  p.m. on Saturdays.  A  vote  was takon of  2-10  confectioners in London and only two  were against the  earlier  hours.  In Manchester a  number expressed  a  desire  to  have 8.30 p.m. as the  closing hour  instead  of 9.30 p.in.  :&apos;s at present.  The witness  produced certified figures, covering a  period  of throe  and  a  half years  for  one  shop,  showing  that  the takings after  8 p.m. represented only 7.0  per  cent,  of  the total, and said  that  the  Act of  1921 provided  a  loophole for the supply of tobacco after  8 p.m.  in shops  carrying on  a  combined trade.  The  Glasgow Corporation  suggested that tho salo  of  all articles enumerated  in  the Act of- 1921  should cease at 9  p.m. and the sale of tobacco allowed up to that  hour:   thi.-,  would remove much irritation anil render easier the enforcement  of the Acts.   Ice  Cream. The  Ice  Cream  and  Temperance  Refreshment  Traders&apos; Federation,  comprising  13 Associations, with approximately  3,000 moni- bers, gave evidence  as to the position of shopkeepers engaged  in the sale of ice cream, non-alcoholic drinks, confectionery and tobacco, the  majority of whom were,  in England, the holders of  Refreshment House Licences, which entitled  them  to sell  &quot;  refreshments &quot;  for consumption  on the premises after  10  p.m.  These  shops  did  their  principal  trade  in the evening, and to be compelled  to  stop  the sale  of ice cream at 8 p.m. on Sunday and 9.30 or 10 p.m. on weekdays deprived them of their most profitable hours. The shops could remain open later for the sale of other forms  of refreshment, and they  were anxious that the restriction placed on the sale of  ice  cream  by its exclusion from  the category  of  refresh- ment should be removed.  The  public  were out  until 10.30  or  11 p.m. and  9.30 was too early to stop sales.  The witness admitted that  a great number  of these shops sold  tobacco  and cigarettes as  well as ice cream in evasion of the law.  It  was  also the  practice  either to make water ices  or to  sell  ice cream  under some other  name after the closing hour. The  law was not uniformly enforced  throughout the country  and the temperance refreshment trader was in consequence placed  in a difficulty which  would  be removed if  ice cream  were a refreshment.  Evidence of a  growing  public demand, for this commodity was also given.  The Scottish Federation of Temperance Refreshment Trade Associations, representing  three Associations,  comprising  the Temperance RefreshmentTrade throughout Scotland, submitted that their trade was by  its very naturean evening trade and any restriction during the hours of common relaxation-tion  when  the public had leisure was a serious injustice, not only to their trade,  but  to the public.   The trade was  not opposed  to the curtailment of  the working  hours of shop assistants and would welcome a law limit- ing  the hours  of  work.  They  urged  that if   restrictions were  to be64768
 imposed tliey should be imposed during tin- morning hours and not  in tho evening, which was the busy time in their trade.  The present restriction resulted in constant trouble to the, shopkeeper  by  his refusal to supply the demands  of customers,  and frequently, owing to disputes and  subse- qttcnt intervention  of  the police, caused  considerable loss to the traders.   The Ice  Cream  Association of Great  Britain and  Ireland, representing all classes  of  firms connected with the manufacture and sale of ice cream, including  retailers,  gave evidence.  He said that ice cream was a highly nutritious  food but very perishable, and  the prohibition of  the sale of so beneficial  a  fixnl after certain  hours  penalised what was becoming  a national food  and  gave  an  unwarrantable  advantage to refreshments which possessed little or no food  value.  He knew  of no reason for the prohibition except  that in  war time it was  desired to restrict  the sale of foods containing  butter fats.  His Association  desired not only freedom to  sell  to  any  hour for consumption on  the premises  but  also for con- sumption  olf  the premises, but  it would  meet   their case if &quot; refresh- mcnls &quot; included  ice cream.  Tobacco. The National  Union of Retail Tobacconists representing over.5,000 members gave evidence in support of the continuance  of compulsoryclosing at 8 p.in.  There are about 400,01)0 holders of licences for the sale of  tobacco.  The  witness  stated  that  on  account of  the  portability  of tobacco it  was  easy for the consumer  to obtain  sufficient  for his  needs before 8 p.in.   The public  had been &quot; educated &quot; to shop  early and thosmall amount  of  business done after S p.m.  during the week prior  toChristmas  when the closing  order was relaxed, was  proof that  the publicdill  not desire  Inter hours.  There was no greater  necessity for tobacco to  be sold  after 8  p.m.  than  there was for any other commodity andthere was  no  reason why those engaged  in the  distribution  of, tobaccoshould be  required  to  work longer  hours than  those engaged in  other trades.   His  organisation would be opposed to   the  sale of  tobacco, in places of amusement after  shops were closed.  He agreed that  the sales of tobacco  in  licensed houses were at present, small but thought if per-mitted to  a later hour than in shops  a  demand would be created and the  public  invited to shop late.  It would be.  unfair to  the tobacco tradeto give other  trades a  monopoly in  the sale of tobacco for a  few  hourseach evening.   The fixing of a closing hour earlier than 8 p.m. would notbe agreeable to the trade.   The present hour met their needs and  theywould oppose any alteration, but would allow trades to fix their own hoursearlier if they desired.  The Scottish Federation of Retail Tobacconists, having a membership of500, supported  the National  Union in the desire  to  have the Act  of1920 made permanent and  the Act of  1921 repealed.   In their view thopresent hours caused no inconvenience to the public and  no general demandfor extension of hours had been made.  Such demand as existed emanatedfrom mixed traders.  They advocated the repeal of the Act  of  1921, as itwas responsible  for much evasion of the 1920 Act,  specially in mixed shops.  Both  organisations  recommended  that  the  enforcement  of the Actsshould be placed in  the hands of the police and that thei penalties shouldbe increased.  Theatres and Cinemas. The Society  of West  End Theatre  Managersrepresenting the managers of practically all the theatres in the AVest Endof London, tho Entertainments Protection Association representing the proprietors and managers  of  the majority  of the  Variety Theatres  inLondon and a largo number in the provinces, the  Theatrical  ManagersAssociation representing 110 theatres  in the provinces,  and the Pro-vincial Entertainments  Proprietors and Managers Association representingsome 300 places of entertainment  of  all  kinds  in the provinces, gave evidence against the continuance of tho Shops (Early  Closing) Acts in  sofar as they affected the sale of tobacco and confectionery in theatresand  music balls,  and  claimed  that places of entertainment  should be
allowed to sell during all  the  hours  they  were open.  Tho witnesses saidthaw  the  restrictions were not  imposed tor any reason ol&quot; general policy but  were designed  originally  to  assist in  the  successful  prosecution  ofthe War.  They  admitted that some restriction on  the hours  of oiuploy-ment of  shop  assistants might be desirable, but  the  Act conferred  no benefit  on theatre employees who were required to remain on duty forother reasons after  the  sales wero prohibited.  Tho public suffered muchinconvenience  from the  restrictions  and frequently complained of intor-fereuce with  their  liberty.  Sales  in  places of entertainment  did  not constitute any unfairness  to shopkeepers;  the  businesses  were conductedat different  times of the day aud such purchases as  were made :n theatreswero  to meet an  immediate need, the goods were  not  taken  away.  Thesale of  tobacco and confectionery showed a substantial profit to the exchequer-tainment  industry without which  prices of admission would perhaps  haveto bo increased.  The industry would not object to the facilities they  were seeking being  granted to other traders whether licensed or not.  they thought the fears of  the  shopkeepers were unfounded ami  if facilitiesfor shops to remain open wero granted  they  would not  be used.  Thetwo definite reasons why the entertainment industry desired the extensionof hours  wero  first, that  it might  make  the profit from  l&apos;hc  saics  and,secondly,  to remove  any  source of irritation to tho public and so encourageattendance  at  places of entertainment.  The Cinematograph Inhibitors&apos;Association  of  Groat Britain and Ireland,  having a membership of 2.800of tho 3.SOl) cinematograph licences issued, also gave evidence.  Their case was that  it was  tho intention of the Shops Acts to protect persons em-ployed  in shops  against excessive hours  of employment,  but that  suchprotection was  unnecessary in the case of cinema employees as the  majorityof cinemas  were  open  only between  tho hours of 6 and 10.30 or 11  p.m.A few in  the centre of large towns opened  from 2.30 to 11.30 p.m.  Thewar restrictions were loyally accepted but  there was no  longer any reasonfor withholding tho liberty  formerly enjoyed and they nsked for its rostora-tion on grounds  of public convenience.  The Shops Acts provoked morecomplaints  than   any  other regulations affecting  cinemas.   The  publicwero  unable to understand, and  managers  were unable to explain,  whyassistants, who wero on duty, could not sell sweets or tobacco after certainfixed  hours  which did  not  coincide with their hours of employment.  the profit derived from these sales was small compared with the whole business.The extension was desired  in order to satisfy the immediate needs of theirpatrons.  It was  not  true that because the sales woro small  the  intv*n-venience to the public was  correspondingly small.  Tobacconists would find that sales in cinemas would be so small that they would bo disinclined toremain  open for  the small amount of trade that could be divided among them.   About one-third  of the attendance was after 8 p.m.   The averagesale of sweets was about  5 per week, and of tobacco about  1 per week.  Licensed  Trade. The National  Consultative  Council  of  the  RetailLiquor  Trade and the Scottish Licensed Tndo Defence Association  gave evidence  in  favour of an amendment of the  Acts to  allow  the sale  of tobacco and matches in licensed  houses during tho whole of the hoursthey  were open  for the  sale  of  excisable  liquors. It was  a very  oldprivilege  to sell  tobacco.  While  thet trade regarded the  sale  of  tobaccoas a  legitimate  source  of profit,  it  was  ancillary only  to the  generalbusiness and was carried on mainly for the convenience of the  customers.The  present restrictions were  a  source of irritation  to customers  anda danger  to the  licence holder to whom even  a technical breach of thelaw was a serious matter.   The trade would be quite prepared to  accepta restriction on  the quantity  sold  at  any  one time.  Their customershad  tobacconists  to whom they went  for their  usual  supplies, and anextension  of the hours  of sale in licensed  houses would  not inflict  anyhardship  on . tobacconists. If  tobacconists  for  their  own  conveniencedesired  to close  at a certain hour  they  had  no right to causo  inoon-venience  to  the  public  or prevent other  traders soiling tobacco  as an   64*68                                                        B 4
auxiliary  to  their principal  business.   While they paid the same licenceduty as the  tobacconists they were only allowed to sell for seven hours a day  in  London and six hours in  the provinces.  Chemists. Tho Retail Pharmacists&apos;  Union,  having a  membership inexcess  of  7.000 out  of  a total of approximately  8.500  pharmacists inEngland and Wales,  supported the continuance of  the  present closing hours,  but  were not authorised to  express  an opinion  on  the desir-ability of  an  earlier closing  hour.   Witnesses  said that  the  principaleffect  of  early closing  from  a business point  of  view  had  been thoelimination  of waste, both  of  time and money, without  diminution ofbusiness.   Another   important result  had  been  the  abolition  of thocoercive power  of  individual  shopkeepers  who, by  persistently keepingopen  long hours,  compelled  their  competitors  to  do the  same.   Theywere not  aware that there  was any  dissatisfaction on  the part of thopublic  and they had never  heard  of  any complaints.  With the  presentexemption,  which  they   recognised was absolutely  necessary,  enablingmedicines or medical or  surgical  appliances to be supplied   after thoclosing hour, the  needs  of the public could be satisfactorily  met.  Thowitness pointed out  that a chemist  on tlio National Health   InsurancePanel  who did not live  on the premises had to expose a notice indicate-ing where medicines could  be  obtained when the  shop  was closed, and suggested  that such  a notice might usefully be displayed  in all cases.  The  Incorporated  Society  of  Pharmacy   and  Drug Store  Proprietorsagreed  generally with the  evidence  given  by  the Retail Pharmacists&apos;Union, but desired  that the exemption allowing medicines and  medicalsupplies  to  be  supplied after the closing hour should  be limited to members  of  the Retail  Pharmacists&apos;  Union and members  of the Incor-porated Society of Pharmacy and Drug Store Proprietors. Shop  hoursshould not  be in  any  way  extended.   The  closing hour on  Saturdayshould at least he  no later  than other days and might  well be an hourearlier.  Drapers. The Drapers&apos;  Chamber  of Trade,  representing   by  directmembership  or affiliation over  S.000 businesses engaged in retail  textiledistribution, claimed to speak for 75  per  cent, of the drapers  of thecountry and expressed  the  strong desire of  that  trade to retain com-pulsory closing at a  fixed hour.  Their witnesses said that  late shoppingwas a habit  rather  than a  necessity,  and the  public  were not incon-venienced  by  the  closing hours at  present  in  force.  The takings inshops  were  not decreased  by early closing,  and one  witness,  formerlyan  assistant, then  the  owner of  a  one-man business,  stated that hewould  go  out of business rather than revert to the old  hours of closing.The introduction of  the shift system  into  retail  trade would be  imprac-ticable.  No additional  business would accrue from the  longer  hours,cost of distribution  would  b-i greatly  increased and supervision wouldbe  both  difficult  and  costly.   No hardship  was  inflicted  on  a  mancarrying  on business on his own account  with  the aid of members ofhis family by requiring him to close at the same hour as other shopswhere  hired  assistants  were  employed. An  Act operating equally  forall  could  not  inflict hardship  in  such a case,  no  distinction  should bedrawn. While a  large  number of shops at present closed earlier than8 p.m. the compulsory closing hour should  not be fixed  earlier.  The  Scottish  Retail  Drapers&apos;,  Outfitters&apos;,   Garment  Makers&apos;  andMilliners&apos;  Federation also -were  in favour of the  continuance of com-pulsory closing.  Hairdressers. The  Hairdressers&apos; Trade Parliamentary Committee andthe National  Federation of Hairdressers   gave  evidence  in support  ofthe continuance on a permanent bnsis  of the present compulsory closing hours.  Witnesses said  that the  hairdressing trade  had always  been  infavour of early closing  and  a large number of Closing Orders  under theActs of 1904 and  1912 had  been obtained.  Their organisations included a considerable number  of owners of  one-man businesses and  ex-service
men, ami  all  agreed that  the restriction  of hours  had  not  adversely affected  the earning  capacity  of  the  trade.   On  account  of the  many different classes of saloons  an earlier  compulsory closing  hour  wouldnot  he desirable.  Traders  in districts  where  earlier closing was practic-abie could  achieve it  by means of Closing  Orders.  On the other hand,the  trade  would welcome  an amendment of the Shops  Acts to  decreasethe  hours.  Many  of  their members combined the trades of hairdresserand tobacconist  and  some added  confectionery, but  the  feeling of  theorganisation  was  against  extended hours  being  allowed   for  the  saleol confectionery.   Such extension led  to complaints  by the public andwas responsible for some evasion  of the  1920 Act.  The present closing hours  caused  no inconvenience to  the  public,  the   majority  of  whomworked shorter hours  than formerly and were well able to  shop earlier.Those  engaged  in serving  the  public were  in any case entitled to con-bideration.  The liberty of the public to  buy  at  any  time meant  inpractice  the bondage  of those engaged in selling.  The  growing practiceof hairdressers  attending  customers at  their  private houses both  afterclosing time  and  on the  weekly  half-holiday  was   regarded  by  theirorganisations as  a breach of the spirit of the  Shops Acts and they wouldlike to have it stopped.  liutchers. The National  Federation  of  Meat Traders&apos;  Associations,a combination of 2&quot;.)5  different  Butchers&apos;  Associations  having a  member-ship of  approximately  19,000  persons owning about  20,000  shops outol&quot; an  estimated total of  -10,000 in England  and  Wales,  said that  thepresent hours  were ample  for  the requirements of the public,  and thetrade was  definitely opposed  to any extension.  Th practice of shoppingearly in  the day grew up  during the period of Food Control and  had continued  since.  The shorter  hours  worked  in industry,  coupled withthe  practice of  paying  wages  on Friday,  assured to the public  ampleopportunities for shopping and  made any  extension of shop hours  uiiucces-sary.  The shift  system  would be difficult to work.  It would prove very-costly  in  the  larger  establishments  and  would  be   impossible  for  thesmaller traders.  Butchers&apos;  shops  were  usually closetl between G  and7 p.m., and in the few districts where they  were kept open to  a laterhour it was found that the  public took  no advantage  of  the  increasedshopping facilities  offered.   There was always the lost  minute shopper,and unless the  closing hour  was fixed  by  law competition compelledall  the shopkeepers to  wait for  him.   An alternative to  Saturday  asthe  late night would be  more convenient in  many  districts  both  totraders and the public.  An extension  of  hours during  the season  atholiday resorts beyond the limits  allowed under the  present Act  wouldnot be supported by  the Federation.  The  shopkeeper with good  equip-nieut does  not  reduce his  prices  towards the end of the  day;  he putsthe unsold  meat into cold storage; but  the  shopkeeper without  equip-ment still  sells cheaper  towards the end  of the  day.   Before the intro-duction of  cold storage  it  was a  common thing for butchers to sell  atcheap rates towards the end of the day.  The  Edinburgh Master Butchers&apos; Association, having  a membership of 250, representing about 90  per cent,  of the butchers in edinburgh and  district, supported  the continuance of the existing hours as beingsatisfactory both to the public  and to the  trade.  Their experience wasthat the public  had acquired the habit of shopping  earlier, and therewas  no desire  for any extension of the  hours during  which shops couldbe open.  The butchers  of  Edinburgh were  not in favour of the exemp-tion in respect of the sale of tripe.  The  members  of the association had a difficulty in interpreting and applying the Annual Order suspending the  General Early  Closing  Order, and  if  any  amendment  of  the act of  1920  should  be  undertaken  the Association  desired that it shouldmake clear whether or not  the suspension  applied  to Closing orders made under the  Act of  1912.                                         -  The  Scottish Federation  of Meat Traders concurred  generally in theovidence given by the Edinburgh Master Butchers&apos; Association;
  Butchers in Scotland favoured  an early  hour for closing,  and in manydistricts  the present  hour  for  the closing  of  butchers&apos;  shops was o&apos;cIock p.m. on all days  of tho week.   That  was considered a suitableclosing hour, and the Federation  urged  thai it should be made uniformthroughout Scotland.  Grocers&apos; shops and dairies in most districts remained open on Saturdaysuntil 0  p.m. Tiose businesses  were  rapidly  extending  their sco()e  tocover  the  sale of sausages and  cooked  meats, thus entering into corn-petition with  butchers in the  sale of  those  articles  after the  usualclosing hour for  butchers&apos; shops.  The  result  was  that  a considerablenumber  of butchers&apos; shops wcro  remaining open  only for  the  sale  ofsausages and cooked meats until  9  p.m. on Saturdays two hours later than the usual  hour for closing.  It.  was  desirable  that   dairies,  grocers&apos;  shops  and  butchers&quot;  shopsthroughout  Scotland should be brought into line with a uniform hour  forclosing not later  than  7  p.in. on  ail days  of  the week and so soon  aspracticable  that hour should bo applied  in  the  case of all shops dealingwith  tho sale of foodstuffs.  Corn ilealerx. Tho  Association  of  Retail  Corn Dealers having  about200  members,  representing about 500  shops  situated  in London  and district,  said that  the majority  of tho trade  desired to  continue the closing of shops at the present hours and  would even  favour 7 p.in.  asthe closing hour for the first three days of the week.  Many members  oftheir Association  dealt in  sweets  and other commodities.   The  Associa-tion  suggested an amendment of the Act so  that  it would  not  bo an offence to supply goods for immediate use or if urgently required, providedtltat ail shops closed at a  fixed hour and the customer making an omer-gency  purchase  remained  outside  the shop.   There was no  general  desireon the part of the public for  shops to  remain open but there was  irritation-tion  at the present prohibition of  casual purchases after the closing hour.The  Association wore in favour of allowing the sale of tobacco and con-fectionery in places of entertainment and public houses during the whole period that such  places were  usually open,  and the sale  of newspapersin the streets (but not in  shops) at any time.  The trade done  in tobaccoand  confectionery  in  theatres and cinemas made  no  difference  to the shops.  There should be a general closing  hour with power  on the partof shopkeepers to apply to the local Council to keep  open  their shopstill  a  later  hour; this would remove the  grievance some  shopkeepershave of being required to close at a fixed  hour.  Makers. The  Ijondon Master  Bakers&apos;  and  Confectioners&apos; ProtectionSociety, representing 1,000  of the estimated total of 3,000  master bakersin London, said that their trade favoured the continuance  of the presenthours as lieing both suitable to the trade and satisfactory to the public.The  habit of late shopping had been broken and there was  no desire  toreturn to it.  They found during  the Christmas period  when the ClosingOrder was relaxed,  that  there  was  very little business done after theusual closing hour,  but they  feared that if shops  were kept open lateregularly  the practice of  late shopping  would  again grow up.  Priorto tho War,  10 and 11  p.m. were  the usual closing hours, but they soldno more during those long hours than they  did after the shorter hoursbecame the  rule.  The Society saw  no need for extended hours except at Christmas.  The National  Association of Master Bakers, Confectioners and Catererssubmitted  that bakers and  confectioners  at seaside resorts desired to  be relieved  of the  necessity to close their shops for half a day each  week,provided that assistants were granted one-half day&apos;s holiday  per  week.They wished to  have  liberty to  substitute for assistants&apos;  weekly halfholiday during a  period not  exceeding eight weeks in the  year a fort-nightfs holiday.   Tbqy urged  that the provisions of the Act with regardto the closing &quot;of shops should not  be extended to apply to vans deliveringbread.  In the  summer season when the demand was very variable  it
 frequently happened that an  extra  hatch  had to he baked  in  the after- noon and delivered in the evening.  It was  impossible to get this distri- hiited and the vans returned to the yard by  the ordinary  closing time, causing groat inconvenience to the householders requiring  supplies  and loss of trade to the baker.   Grocers. The  Federation of Grocers&apos; Associations, having a membership of 1(5,000, representing  -10,000 shops, gave  evidence in support  of tho continuance  on a permanent  basis of the  Act  of 1920, but  recommended that  the Act  of  1921 should he discontinued.  The first duty of a grocer was to render adequate  service to his customers in  the distribution of essential  foodstuffs  and  if adequate facilities were  not provided for tho public  to  obtain their  requirements, grocers  and  provision  merchants would be among the first to  become aware of dissatisfaction.  They  were aware of no dissatisfaction and  there was  no demand on the part of the public for later hours.  The public had been  &quot; educated &quot; up to shopping within  the  present  hours and had acquiesced  in the  arrangement;  they had not boon  forced into it.   The case for shortening shop  hours was no longer  a  matter of speculation  but  had  been  proved  by  practical ex- perience.  The shorter hours were of great benefit to all  persons engaged in  shops, whether  employees  or employers,  and had  not resulted  in  a reduction in  the volume of trade done.   The  suggestion  that  the hours of employment of shop assistants should be regulated while keeping shops open,  by means of n shift  system,  was  impracticable, costly,  easy of evasion and  opposed  to  the  interests of  large numbers of  shopkeepers. Those who personally  supervised  their businesses would be deprived of all leisure.  The Federation  were opposed  to exemptions and considered that those granted  under the Act of  192]  had been  responsible for many infringements of the law.  Cases were known of shops taking to the  sale of exempted  articles for the purpose of keeping open later.  A uniform closing hour  was al)SoiuteIy  necessary for  the  proper administration of the law, exemptions caused confusion.  They did not agree  that evasion of the  law  was  evidence of  public dissatisfaction  with  the  restrictions. The present  restrictions  inflicted  no hardship  on  ex-service  and otiher owners of one-man  businesses.  The number of  such  compared  with the number of assistants and shopkeepers who  would  be  adversely  affected by an  extension of  hours  was  infinitesimal.  It  would be  manifestly unfair  to permit one class of trader to  remain open  while  compelling others to close.  Bankruptcy  returns for  the last 4J years  showed  that the failure of ex-service men who had started  in business since the  War was due to other causes than early closing.  The  Federation  were opposed to local  authorities  having power to suspend the evening closing restric- tions during  the season at holiday resorts, and did  not agree that more trade would he done during extended hours.   The majority of  tho members of the Federation  had expressed theni-selves in favour of the  enforcement of the Acts being placed  in  the handsof the  police  as  being likely  to  lead to more adequate  supervision anduniformity of practice in  administration.   They also thought  that  the nominal penalties inflicted in many eases  at present encouraged ratherthan  deterred those who  broke the law.  The  Scottish Federation of Grocers and Provision Merchants Associa-tions. representing 7,000 shops or about 70  per  cent, of the total  retailgrocery trade in Scotland,  gave  evidence generally  in support  of  thecontinuance of the Act of 1920,  but witness  said he  had no authority to speak for any trade other than grocery and expressed no  opinion  withregard to the  Act of 1921.  The  Institute of Certificated Grocers, representing over 2,500 members and 3,500 students,  gave  evidence of the advantages from an educationalpoint of view of early closing.  The question of exemptions touched thework  of the  Institute only to  a very slight  degree, and  the  Councildesired  the continuance of the present ihours.
  The  United Kingdom  Association  of Multiple Shop Proprietors, whichis  concerned solely- with  the grocery and  provision  trade, favoured  themaking permanent of the Acts of 1920 and 1921 with certain modifications.They suggested that the Local Authority in each locality should  be given power  to fix which day in the week should be the late closing day, nccord-ing to the needs of the locality.  In the case, however,  of large towns such as London, one closing hourshould be  fixed  for the whole  of  the town  in order to avoid shops onopposite sides of the same street closing at different hours.  The  present  closing  hours were  inconvenient  at  all  general  holidayperiods such as Easter  and  Christinas,  and should bo  wholly suspendedduring such periods  without the necessity  of a special  Order from  theSecretary of State on each occasion.  limit Trmlc. The  Joint  Parliamentary   Committee  of  the  RetailBespoke Making  and  Repairing Boot Trade, representing not loss than350,000 persons, employers and  workers, engaged in the retail boot trade,supported  the continuance of the Early Closing Acts.  The representativespecially stressed the fact that  the Committee represented both employersand  employed iu  the trade, and said there was a  remarkable unanimityon tho subject of early  closing.  They  particularly desired that  the  Actshould  be  so amended as to include boot-  repairing shops.  There wero25,000 repairing shops on the Trade Board List and there were  at least three times that number of one-man shops employing no labour.   Witnesssaid that  boot  repairing  was a dusty, unhealthy trade, and long periodsin the unhealthy atmosphere were largely responsible for the high  sicknessrate among repairers.   Owing  to  the fear of  competition among  smalltraders, voluntary  effort  was  ineffective  and early  closing  could  bobrought  about  only  by  legislative  action.   Orders  enforced  by  someauthority wore tho only  means  of restricting the unscrupulous trader.  Fruiterers,  Florists  unit  Fishmongers. The National Federation of retail  Fruiterers, Florists  and  Fishmongers,  representing 37  affiliatedassociations and  a number  of individuals,  gave  evidence.  The repro-sentative  was  unable to state  tho total membership  of the  Federation.A largo majority of  those engaged in  the trade desired a  permanentgeneral closing Order for  all  shops at 8  p.in. 9 p.m. on Saturdays without any exemptions.  The  numerous Closing  Orders under  the  act of 1912,  which  had  been obtained  for the fruit  and  allied  trades,  wasproof  that the  exemptions allowed under the  present law  were  not necessary.  They  found  that the different hours  allowed for the sale ofdifferent  commodities was  the  cause of  many breaches of the law, as  itwas difficult for  a trader  to deny service of  non-exempted goods  to acustomer who hat! been served with  exempted goods.  The notice &quot;  Tillsshop is open only for the sale  of sweets and minerals :&apos;  was  but a cover for the illegitimate sale  of other goods.   such a notice had boon  displayedin  a shop which  had no stock  of either of the goods named.   An  Orderwithout exemptions would  be a  convenience both  to traders and toadministrators.   The   Federation   was  powerful  but  legislation  was necessary  because there were  always  traders outside  any organisationwho would not be parties  to  voluutary arrangements.   The  federation was satisfied that  the  public did  not require  longer  shopping hours.Late shopping on the part of the public  was very much a matter of habit.They  did  not  buy less  owing to restricted hours.  Extended  hours wero not necessary for the disposal of soft fruit.  Small losses were inevitable, but the  trade  was  so  well regulated  that  they were infrequent,  and notwithstanding the risks the Federation desired  no exemption  in favour of 6oft fruit  or  perishable articles. Their  evidence was  not  intended to cover such things  as medicines, motor  supplies  or newspapers,  but witness expressed the opinion that all trades should  be brought  into  line. In the case of fresh fish the  public did not  get  the  benefit of reduced prices at tho  end of the  day as was  formerly the case. The  necessity for  clearing stocks had been  overcome by improved methods of storing
                                   15fish, and  dealers did  not  object to having stocks  left over.   The buyersof the cheaper  kinds  of fish now  made  their purchases  in  the morning,and  in  the case of a  glut the price was naturally reduced but was fixidby  agreement  first  thing in the  morning  and fishmongers  only  boughtwhat they could sell  having regard  to  the price.  Tho Liverpool and District  Fishmongers and  Poulterers Association,representing over  two-thirds  of  the  Fishmongers  and  Poulterers  in liverpool, gave evidence supporting the views expressed by the NationalFederation.  There  was  a  strong feeling  among  all sections of  shop-keepers,  including  those  who employed  no  assistants,  against  any extension of hours.   Over 50 per cent, of the fishmongers and poulterersin Liverpool were  now  closing at  0.30  in  the earlier part, of  the  weekand  7 and S p.m.  on Friday and  Saturday respectively.  A  compulsoryOrder was, however, necessary to protect the majority who desired to  close,against the  minority who  would   remain  open.   Early  closing did notdiminish  the  total  sales.  The public was in sympathy with the  EarlyClosing Act  and did  not desire longer hours.  The last  hour was the worst hour for trade.  It was untrue that when  there were large  catchesof fish  much of it was destroyed  because  there was  not time to  sell it:90 per  cent, of what was destroyed was  small  and unsaleable.  Peoplehad  altered  their  habits  of living,  and  after  a  certain  hour  in the evening no business was done no matter how long  shops remained  open.There was no need for any  exemption lor the sale  of fresh  fish and theypressed for its deletion from the Act.  The Retail  Fruiterers&apos; and Florists&apos;  Association,  representing 500 outof 30.000  fruiterers in the London  District, also gave evidence in supportof compulsory  early  closing.  The majority  of  their members were  ofopinion that S p.in. 9 p.m. on -Saturday  were suitable closing hours fortheir trade,  and only in  isolated  cases  did fruit shops remain open till9.30 p.m.  It was admitted  that the  closing of all shops at  S p.in. mightinflict hardship on  individual  traders in exceptional positions, but not-withstanding  this the -Association favoured S p.m.  as  the  closing  hour,and desired that  the exemption in  favour of soft  fruit should be  with-drnwn.  Mini  nil ]]&apos;tifirs. The  National Union  of  Mineral  Water. Munuiuc-turers&apos;  Associations, comprising about  1,700 of the 2.000  mineral watermanufacturers in England and  Wales,  urged the  removal of all  restric-tions on the sale of  meneral waters for  consumption off the  premises  atleast up to the permitted  hours for the sale of intoxicating liquors!   Thebulk  of the output  of many manufacturers was delivered to  small  shop-keepers, and  the  present  restrictions were a handicap to trade and aninconvenience  to the  public, who  were  forced to go  to public  houses  toobtain  that  kind  of  liquid  refreshment.  Mineral waters  could   beobtained  in refreshment houses up to a later hour than in public  houses,but  refreshment houses  were not  usually to be found in the  residentialparts of towns, while  public  houses were to be found  in all districts, andin any case they could only sell for consumption on  the premises.  It wasformerly a common  practice for people who had been out  for recreationto purchase mineral  waters on their return for consumption at supper.Such purchases were made  at very  small  local shops, which were  nowdeprived of this trade.  Those shopkeepers,were usually people  in  a verysmall way of  business  who found  it difficult  to  make a  living,  andrestricted  hours were to  them  a  very  real hardship.  Shops where  noassistants were employed should be allowed to keep open for the  supplyof mineral waters at  least until licensed houses closed.  Witness thoughtthat  shops employing assistants would  have to conform  to  the  closing hour, and admitted  the difficulty  of differentiating between assistantsand  members  of the  family,  ft  would  be impossible to  allow shops  toremain  open only for the sale of mineral  waters, and if allowed to  remain open  they should be entitled to sell everything usually sold.   The  poorerclasses  had made no effort  to accommodate themselves  to  the  earlierclosing  hours.
  Newspapers. Tho  National  Federation  of  Retail  Newsagents,  Book-sellers and Stationers,  having a membership of  10,000 of the estimated total of 30,000  newsagents in the country, gave evidence in favour  of thosale of  newspapers being  brought under  the  same restrictions as other trades.  Tho Federation  claimed  to be representative,  more than mostothers, of the one-man type of business, and the experience gained duringthe war period had completely transformed their  view as to tho necessityfor keeping shops open late.   A ballot  on the question of tho inclusionof newspapers  in any future early closing legislation  showed that Oo percent,  of their  numbers  were in  favour of the  proposal.  The small shop-keeper  was as  keen  to  observe  tho  early closing  hours as those who dida larger trade,  and  tho claim  that owners of the one-man type of busi-ness desired to keep open later  than other shopowners was  fallacious.No complaint would  bo made  by tho confectioner-newsagent if all con-fectionory  shops were  required to  close  at S p.m.  Tho habits  of thepublic had changed and shops had no longer any  need to keep  open late.More newspapers were sold at the  present time than ever before,  buttho salo of newspapers in the  streets was  unfair  to  the  shopkeeper  andwould need to bo brought under the same  regulations  as applied to  shops.The last editions of  the evening newspapers  wero now  published much earlier than formerly, and  it was possible for  the public, even  in  remotedistricts,, to obtain  them before 8 p.m.  Sales  in  the  streets fell off afterS p.m. and there were  fewer street  sellers after that  hour, except  in thovicinity of terminal railway stations and a few  other selected  points in large cities.  Any regulations  made might allow sales  at such  places tocontinue to a  later  hour  for the benefit of travellers.   The  Federationrecognised  the  impossibility of  doing away  entirely with street trading,but desired that it  should bo  controlled.   Street traders were  admitted to  membership  of the  Federation,  and they  desired that it  should be unnecessary for their members  to remain  in  the streets to a  late hourfor the sake of casual  trade.   In  the absence of regulations  they were bound to remain out to meet competition.  The Newspaper Society, representing approximately 1.000 publications,including 8&quot; of the 93  evening newspapers published  in Great Britainoutside London, urged  the continuance  of the  existing exemption in.favour  of  the sale of newspapers.  Previous Committees which had  in-quired into the subjects of shop hours and street  trading(&quot;) had reportedin  favour  of  excepting  the  sale  of newspapers,  and  local  legislationalways  provided for their sale  in the streets.  The existing Shops Actsexempted the salo of newspapers,  and it seemed evident that Parliamentrealised the importance of such sales  and  had  taken every  precautionto  protect them.  Normally,  no newspapers were  published  later than p.m.,  but it  would be a serious thing if the law prevented the distribu-tion of special editions.  Newspapers were  of all commodities  the mostperishable  and must  be sold,  if at  all, on the day of publication.  Dis-tribution was the vital  factor,  and  assuming the  best transport arrange-ments  it  was  impossible for  many  provincial  evening  papers  to  reachtheir  circulation areas before  7.30 p.m., and in some cases 9 p.m.  they then  had to be distributed to the  newsagents  before the public could obtain  them.   News  sheets wero  sold  in the streets long before shop-keeper  newsagents existed, and  the proportion  of  sales in  streets tothose in  shops was as 3:1.   It  was  difficult  to  estimate  the totalnumber, but  there  were  many thousands of poor  uneducated  peopleengaged in this work.  They included a large proportion of widows  andcripples, who were  quite incompetent to organise any opposition to theinterference with their trade, and the industrial market was quite unableto offer them alternative employment.  The   Newspaper  Proprietors&apos;  Association  representing  the  Londonevening newspapers  also gave  evidence  in support  of  the  continuanceof the  existing arrangements for the sale of newspapers both in shops(*) Street Trading Committee 1922 (Cmd. 1624).
and by struct sellers.   The sale of evening  newspapers provided a livingfor a large number of  more or less derelict men and women  who cateredfor a considerable section of the public which uesired to purchase eveningpapers  alter  leaving  places  ol  amusement.  &apos;lhe  street  sellers  bad  noobjection to working till a lute hour and  most of them did not startwork until inid-day.   Enquiries made  by  the three&apos; London eveningpapers  as to the extent ol the street sales of late editions  alter 7.3u p.m.in me London district  showed that they  amounted to about 2U,0LHJ quiresor over hall a million copies per week.  A quire consists of 21 newspapersiu  London aud  M in the country.  Street  sellers  made &apos;Jd. per quirepro/it  and  any legislation which  prevented  these sales  would  not onlyinterfere with the habits of a  large section of the public which purchasedpapers  late in the evening, but would also deprive a considerable numberol unfortunate people of a substantial proportion of their earnings,   the newspaper proprietors  hail no desire to interfere with  newsagents  if they decided  to cease selling  at  6 p.in.,  but they  were anxious  that streetsales should not be interfered with.   It was sometimes thought that  ifthe street  sellers were  taken oil, sales in shops would be  improved,  butexperiments which  they  had  carried  out had proved that such was  notthe case.  In  London there were O.lX-0 newsagents to 18,000 street  sellers.  The  Periodical  Trade Press  and  Weekly   Newspaper  Proprietors&apos;Association, representing  over 500  publications, urged that  the existingexemption  in lavour of the sale of newspapers should be continued  and extended to the sale of periodicals.   Alemhcrs  of  the Association com-plaincd that it  was unfair to  permit  the sale of newspapers after  S p.m.and prohibit  the salo  of  periodicals.  It was  impossible  in many cases to distinguish  the  one from the other.  All newsagents sold  periodicals,and it  would involve  no  extra  labour nor  would it curtail  the  leisureof either shopkeepers or assistants if their sale were  permitted withoutrestriction as was the case with  newspapers.  Many newsagents reiualuedopen until y.3o lor the  sale  of eouieetiouery,  and it  was  an auomalythat periodicals could  not be sold.  Witness  agreed  that a  periodicalwas dihieuit to define,  but suggested that it  was a publication containinggeneral  information as opposed to topical  news.   A  monthly magazinewas a periodical, but a book  was  something  complete  in  itself that  was published once only.  Shopkeepers desiring to keep within the law weresometimes  in  a  genuine dimculty in not knowing what was a newspaperand what  was  a periodical.   If the  extension  of  the exemption  askedfor  were granted  it would not  result  in  shops,  which  now closed  at8 p.m.,  being kept open for the sale of periodicals.  Co-operative  Societies. The  Parliamentary   Committee of  the  Co-operative Congress gave evidence on behalf of the Co-operative Movement.There  were 1,^92 societies having 5,lX/0,OUl) members and operating  notless  than 10,000  shops, covering every conceivable class  of retail trade.From the  extensive experience thus  gained the (Jo-operative Movementwas  unanimously in favour of at least retaining the present  hours.  TheEarly Closing Acts had operated to the  advantage of  thousands of shopworkers without inflicting any hardship on the public.   The statement that an extension  of  hours would  be of benefit to the working  classeswho were  unable to shop early  in  the day  was not borne out  by their experience. The majority of  their members was drawn from the workingclasses,  and although most Co-operative stores closed earlier than 8 p.m.,no  difficulty or  inconvenience had been experienced  on  that  account.Any extension of hours would inflict hardship on the assistants and wastotally  unnecessary in  the interest of either the traders  or the  public.If any  alteration  of tho Act  were contemplated  it  should  be  in  thedirection of shortening Tathor than lengthening tho hours.   When  theGeneral  Early  Closing  Order  came  into  force the public largely believedtliat shops  were  kept open too long  and was ready to fall  in with  thearrangement.   Their experience  was that the same volume of trade was done  in the shorter hours,  and they thought  that the  general  trader
                                  4ocould close  at the same  hours  as Co-operative  stores without  injury to himself.  Sonic  ot  their  siiops closed  in the  middle of the day inprovincial areas,  but  as  that was  taken in conjunction with the arrange-ment for a -IS-hour  week, it necessarily  follows that those shops were open for a longer period on the main  shopping  days Friday and  Saturday.Exemptions should  not he granted except in the  case of medicines,   theproposal to  allow an  alternative  to Saturday as  the late night had notbeen  considered  by the  Co-opcralivo  Movement, but  trade  tended tomove from  Saturday  to  Friday,  and  it would lie a good thing if localauthorities  had  power to  make the alteration.  The Co-operative Move-ment saw no  necessity  for  the  sale of  confectionery in theatres  alter the closing  hour for  shops but would  not  object  to it, though  traders&apos;organisations  would  probably  oppose  it as  a favour  extended to one class.  The  demand was insufficient to  justify the  exception and  to  allowsales  in  theatres during  all the hours they  were open  would affect thegeneral principle of early closing.  Small  Shopkeepers. The National  Federation of  Shopkeepers  and small Traders&apos; Protection Associations, comprising alxiut 30 associations and  representing approximately  5,000 members,  90 per cent,  of  whom were small  traders  carrying  on  business  without  assistants, were infavour  of the continuance of the present  closing hours.   Witness  saidthat at the Annual Conference of the  National Federation held in  1919it was rejiorted from  all the branches that their members  desired  carlyelosing  to continue.  In  1921. owing to an outcry against  early closinga mass meeting was organised to  ascertain the real  position and in spiteof organised  opposition  a resolution  in favour  of  making the presenthour permanent was passed by a two-thirds majority. Witness mentioned that  from  190S  to 191S he was   himself  ii  small shopkeeper who  kepthis shop open from 7 n.m. to 11  p.ni. on  weekdays and also  opened on sunday mornings.  When the proposal  to close shops early in  the eveningwas made he, in common with many thousands of small traders, believedhe  would be ruined,  and  did all  he could  to oppose the Order.  As theresult of actual  experience of early closing he had  entirely changed his views.  The shortening of hours had not led to a reduction in  the amountof trade.  As an Association Secretary during the  last 10  years ho hadbeen in constant touch with the one-man  shopkeeper  and was satisfiedthat the majority  were of the same opinion.  Those holding the oppositeview were  so few  that they might  be disregarded.  There were  a fewwho would  keep  open day and  night if they could in order to catcty thelast customer, and he had known small traders  who opened  their  shopsat  midnight to catch the trade  of excursionists  leaving at 2  a.m., butthe results of  that  experiment  had  been so  disappointing  that fewrepeated it.  The  Federation  doubted whether  there  was any demandfor  relaxation of  the Order during the  season   at  holiday resorts but,provided the  present hours were maintained by law,  would  not  objectto holiday  resorts  contracting out of  the  Act during their season hv  amajority decision  of  the shopkeepers themselves.   Witness said  that90 per  cent,  of general  shops sold confectionery  and they  would likethe exemptions granted &quot;by  the 1921 Act done away with.  They desireda universal 8  p.m.  closing,  and a  large proportion  were  not  taking advantage  of the later hours although they sold  exempted  articles.   Representatives  of small shopkeepers carrying on  business at  Ilfra- combe,  Margate  and Yarmouth urged  the  amendment  of  the  Early Closing Acts  so as to allow shops at  seaside resorts to keep open  later during  the letting and fishing seasons.   Witnesses said that tho Acts inflicted serious hardship on tradesmen at seaside resorts where the bulk of the yoar&apos;s trade  had  to be done  in  n  short  season of  three  or four months.  Early closing also inflicted hardship on visitors who were often unable to  supply  their needs on  arrival or before  departure.   Many of the shops in seaside  towns were closed entirely during the winter months and those  remaining open only covered part of  their expenses.  All had
 to live on tho profits  made in tho summer season.  Tho proposal to give local authorities power  to suspend the operation of the Act during the season  would  he unsatisfactory and might result in tho concession  being refused.  They suggested that  if an extension of hours  were  granted assistants should bo safeguarded  by  means of a  legal limitation  of their hours of labour. Tho representative of the National Federation of Meat Traders&apos;  Association  (Inc.)  considered a  seaside  place  entitled during their season to get an extension of hours.  The occupiers of certain shops situated near tho London railway termini represented that  the  Early Closing  Act hod  inflicted serious  financial loss  on  all traders in the vicinity of large  railway stations as it prevented their taking  advantage of  the trade  to  be  done with  returning excur- sionists.  During holiday seasons and on particular occasions,  such  as the  Association Football our Tie Match, the  railways  provided cheap travelling  facilities which induced very large numbers of  people to  visit London.  The bulk of  these  visitors had  to  return  by  trains leaving tho  termini between  the hours of ft p.m. and midnight and often after midnight.  Consequently between  those hours the streets near the stations were filled with people  who had money and  were prepared  to  spend it in buying trinkets and  other  small articles,  and a  very large trade was done.   Compulsory  closing  at 8  or  9 p.m.  had  deprived  shopkeepers of that trade  aud they found that they could  not mako it up at any other time.   So serious was the loss that they had to  resort to  re-opening the shops at midnight  in  the&apos; hope of catching the end of what might  have been a busy  evening&apos;s  trade.  Often these  late  openings  proved dis- appointing because the  excursionists  bad  gone.  Witness  suggested  that power should  be given to local authorities to grant an extension of hour on particular  nights.  He thought local authorities  might  have a certain dispensing power for  individual shops and for special occasions, so  that shopkeepers could go  to the local authority and ask  for exemption for particular dates.  Two witnesses Mr.  F. A.  Macquisten. K.C.. and  Mr. H.  Becker who represented no  associations gave evidence in support of the removal of all restrictions on the closing of shop? and the substitution of the limita- tion of the hours of labour for shop  assistants.  Both witnesses  thought that the early closing movement was  fostered by the large multiple  shop proprietors for the  purpose of forcing  the  small   shopkeeper   out  of business.  The present restrictions outraged  the fundamental principles of liberty and it was  against  the public interest that  a majority should be able to stop a man working when he desired  to  do so.   A shopkeeper working for  himself  ought  to have  the  same  liberty as is allowed  to persons in other walks of life: the restrictions  operated to  prevent pri- vate enterprise. Mr. Kelso stated that  the  occupiers of one-man  and one-woman shops were  strong against restricted   hours.   Mrs.  Burrell urpred  that a shonkeeper ought to lie allowed  to carry on  for himself and  the -Acts  of 1020 and I9&apos;21 ought to  he discontinued.   Mr. Sanders contended that liberty was being interfered with  and that these restric- tions were driving  honest people into the ranks  of revolutionaries.  In fairness the three hours (S to 11) taken  away for  war purposes should be restored, but as  a compromise the present hours  might bo  accepted and  the hours on Snnclny extended to 9  or  9.30  p.m.  The onlv wav asmall trader  could offset the  b&apos;cr buying power  of  the big groups would be to  work longer,  ro  sell more  goods  and to  get a bigger turnover. Organised  opinion  mif*ht be  unanimous  for restricted hours,  but  thevast m^i-^ri^v of sho^t-roners were nnorn;inispd.  Market  Traders. The National Market  Traders&apos;  Federation,  cora-pr;sino;  98 assofJitions  ind  representing  about  3.500 members,  gave-evidence as to the conditions  prevailing in markets.  Witness said  thatmarkets had  always  been subieot to  regular fixed  closing  hours vendor bvn-!n\rS tivde hv the lc&quot;nl authorities, and the.  only  effect of the Early Closing Acts was to  mike the closing  hour earlier.  &apos; Market traders had not  generally  hnnefitorf  FROM  the. extension of hours  granted  to certain
trades under tlio Aci of 1921 owing to  the  practice of closing the wholemarket at the same  hour.   Closing  Orders  under the  1912  Act affectedmarkets and the closing of one section of a  market under such  an order had  a detrimental effect on the remainder.  The provision allowing acustomer  who was  in  the  shop at closing time to he  served alter thathour  did  not benefit  the  market  trader   as  it  did  the  shopkeeper.Different   interpretations  were given  by  different  authorities.  -Sometreated the whole market as a shop, others allowed the customer actuallybeing served to bo attended to, others  again allowed customers waitingat the stall to  bo served.   Witness  was aware of no  binding decisionon tho meaning of the words  &quot; in  the  shop &quot;  and urged  the advantageof uniformity in administration.  Market traders accepted  the  principleof compulsory closing but felt that the hours  fixed  by the  Act of 1920were the earliest that could  bo imposed  without serious damage  to trade.The  present hours  were barely sufficient  to meet  the needs of  working-class customers.  Any further curtailment of hours would seriously incon-venience  the  public  whose service  had  to  be  the market  trader&apos;s firstconsideration.  Witness pointed out  that in an organisation embracingevery class of trade unanimity  on  the  question of closing hours  wasimpossible, and said that there &quot;was  a minority  who considered that thereshould be an extension of hours&apos;on the ground  that  business in marketsoften did not begin  until evening.   The majority,  however, consideredthat it was possible to carry on their business  within  the present hourswith  the  exception of the  late  night  when one extra hour  would be extremely  valuable to them  and  he believed the shopkeepers would  alsowelcome &quot;it.  The Federation urged  that  local  option should be  allowed for tho choice of the  late  night.    Saturday  was  suitable for a largenumber of towns but there were many where Friday  or some other nightwould be  preferable.  Local bye-laws always fixed a certain  hour   for  the  closing  of   themarket,  but prior to  the passing  of the  Early  Closing Act   the usualhours  were 10.30 or 11 p.m.  on Saturdays and  8  p.m. on most othernights.  The advantage of the  bye-laws over the Act was that they fixedthe  hours according to local  conditions.   Some  markets were  over  by4 p.m. while others did not commence  till  teatime.  In such cases busi-ness was  now restricted to  two or  three hours.  The hours for marketscould not well be  extended unless  a similar extension were granted toshops but the arguments in favour o  an additional  hour on the busiestnight would apply to the shops no less than  to the markets.  If  the shopsdid not want the extension,  he thought  the markets were so distinct fromordinary  shops that they might be  treated  separately and granted extratime  in the same way as the  confectionery trade had  been by the  act of 1921.   The need for an alternative to Saturday as the late night was felt most  in smaller places in proximity  with large towns.  In such placesthe public  visited  the largo town  on Saturday for pleasure  and other purposes  and made  another night,  usually Friday,  the local  shoppingnight.  The payment of wages on Friday had  not much bearing on  thematter.  The  Federation did  not press for longer hours  generally onlyon tho one night.  They wanted the present hours continued except oiltho  late  night  when  they  desired  an  extension of  one hour  and they wanted local option  in the  choice of the late  night.  Off-Licence  Holtlcrs-The Federation of  Off-Lieence  Holders&apos; Associa-tions,  comprising about 80  associations and representing approximately5,000 members  out of an  estimated total  of  22,000  off-licence holdersin  the country, drew  attention  to certain  anomalies which resulted from their having to conform to the Licensing Acts in  respect of  thesale of alcoholic  liquors and to the  Shops in respect  of the  sale of othergoods, and suggested that off-licence holders should  bo permitted, whileopen  for  the sale  of  alcoholic liquor, to supply foodstuffs  and tobacco.Thore were  three  main  classes of  off-licence  holders;  the  family wineand  spirit merchant; tho  high-class  grocer  with  a  wine and spiritlicence;  and  the  off-licence holder  who sells  draught beer   and such
.r)lsmall commodities  as bread, cheese,  etc.  Off-licence  holders would be content if allowed  to sell  bread,  cheese,  butter  and  tobacco, speciallytobacco, and would not object to the quantity of  tobacco and cigarettesbeing limited to one packet per  customer after 8 p.m.   They only stockedthese things to  accommodate their customers, and  they were only askedto supply them  if they were really needed.  Tho sale  of mineral waterspresented a  special difficulty, for while they could  bo sold up to  9..&quot;10or 10 p.m. on week-days,  sales  must  cease at 8 p.m.  on Sundays, whilealcoholic beverages coidd be  sold to a  later hour.   The  Federation  was anxious  that  nothing  should   be  done  which  unnecessarily  imposedlonger hours upon  shopkeepers or their assistants, hut  since off-licenceholders had  to  keep their shops open  for the  sale  of alcoholic liquorsthoy  thought they should  be permitted, while open  for that  purpose,to meet the reasonable demands of  their customers  in  the  matter offood  and  tobacco.  The majority of off-licence  holders carried on  busi-ness with  the aid of members of their families only, less than 5 pen cent.employed  assistants.  Exhibitions. We heard evidence of the Secretary of the &quot; Daily Mai! &quot;Ideal Home Exhibition, the Industrial) Trades Exhibitions Syndicate and provincial Exhibitions, Limited,  and others with  reference  to the retailsales at exhibitions  after the closing  hours for  shops.   Most of  theexhibitions held in  different parts of the country were promoted primarily for  the  purpose of  bringing goods  before  the public  and creating ademand  through  the shops.  Many  exhibitors  gave  away, or sold ata loss, samples of their goods  in anticipation of subsequent orders throughlocal traders.  Any sales that were made were for the  purposes of  adver-advertising and  were to the advantage of the  local  trader who must supply the  continued demand.  They could  not be considered in any way com-petitive.  Trade and  other exhibitions  were recognised  throughout  theworld as a  vital influence  in the development and stimulation of  trade,and during the last  100 years  had become a permanent feature of  thebusiness life  of this country.   The amount of  retail  trade  done atexhibitions  was infinitesimal compared with  the  amount  subsequentlydone as a result of them.  It was a  great hardship to exhibitors to be prohibited from making sales during the evening hours when attendanceswere greatest.   An exhibition could not be held successfully unless goods were sold, but  the selling  was only, part of its main  object,  which waseducative.  The idea that  these restrictions  were necessary for  the  pro-tection of assistants employed  at exhibitions was an  erroneous one, asthey acturdlv  worked shorter  hours  than  when  employed  in  shops.Exhibition  work  was  popular,  and   there  was  competition  amongemployees for  selection  for such  work.   Witnesses  had  never  foundtradesmen object to  sales  being  continued after 8 p.m. and  thought itinconceivable that  anyone would use an exhibition  as a shop.  Letterswere produced  from  a  number of tradesmen in  the neighbourhood ofOlympia,  London,  expressing the opinion  that  the Ideal Home exhibition-tion  was  advantageous to  their  businesses and offering  no objection tosales taking place  after  closing hours.  By far  the  larger  proportionof visitors  entered  exhibitions during  the evening, and it was a  con-venience  to the public if purchases could be  delayed  until, they were about to leave. The principle of allowing  some relaxation in  favourof exhibitions  had been adopted in the Act  of 1912.  and  it was urgedthat it  should be extended to  evening  closing.  They  suggested  that power should be given to  local  authorities to exempt from the operationof  the Act  properly  constituted  and  organised  exhibitions.   They  didnot  desire  to  interfere with the closing  of  shops but  thought exhibition-tions  were on  a different plane and  should  be  outside  the  scope ofevening closing Orders.   Some safeguards would  be  necessary to  pro-tect  retailers from  unscrupulous persons who might  exploit the exemp-tion  for  their  own  benefit,  and a  definite hour  for  closing should befixed.  Ten o&apos;clock was thought to be tho most suitable hour.  The saleof  confectionery  and  tobacco  after  the  usual  closing  hour should Be
prohibited.   Except at a Tmacco or  Confectionery  exhibition they couldnot  be  regarded as exhibits.  The Scottish  Retail  Drapers&apos;.  Outfitters&apos;,Garment Makers&apos; and Milliners&apos;  Federation opposed the selling  of  any goods  by retail at exhibitions  after  the  shop closing hours.  There  wasno demand from  the public  in  Scotland  for later  selling  at exhibitionsor  from any  general  body ol  shopkeepers.   Even subsidiary sales wouldunsettle the  whole  body  of  shopkoeping opinion  in the  neighbourhoodand create a sense of injustice that might ultimately  result in  agila-tion for the lengthening  of  hours.   No  sales  of  any  kind should beallowed  inside the exhibition after  the  usual  closing hours because ofthe unfair competition between  the stallholder and  the shopkeeper.  Thoordinary shopkeeper  does not benefit by  the selling in  exhibitions afterhours.  Further  evidence on this subject was  given by  AdministrativeAuthorities.  Motor Agents. The Motor  Agents&apos; Association  submitted a   niemo-rnndum urging that  any  regulation  compelling the closing of  garagesat  any  fixed hour  would cause  great  inconvenience to  the motoringpublic  unless  provision were  made for the supply at  any hour of  petrol and accessories  urgently  needed.   The  garage  proprietor might  liocalled  upon  by  a passing  motorist at any  hour and the  fact that  thenotice  &quot; Open day  and  night &quot; had become necessary  and  useful  wasproof of the  need of such service.   The compulsory cloning of garagesat a fixed hour might be  of advantage to  the  owners of  small garageswho found it difficult&apos; to  get their rest,  but the matter should  be con-sidered  from  the  public point of view.   It  would he practically!  imiios-sihle to  carry out any regulation prohibiting the doing  of  repairs after a fixed  time.  Auctions. A  number of auctioneers carrying  on  business at Aberdeenurged that the Shops Acts should be amended so as  to permit auctioneersto finish selling  all goods  exposed for a particular sale  irrespective ofthe closing hour for  shops or at least- so as  to  permit sisles to continueafter the closing hour to  persons who were  present at the closing hour.The present  Acts were held to require  auctioneers  to  stop selling atthe  hour fixed  for  the  closing of  shops except  when  selling  privateeffects  in private houses.   This inflicted hardship on the working classes,who were  usually employed till  5 or G p.m. and  thus  had very little time to  attend evening auction sales.  Pyrotechnistx. The British  Pyrotechnists&apos;  Association drew attentionto the  position  under the Early  Closing Acts  of retailers  of fireworks,and  urged that  the  weekly  half-holiday and early closing regulations should  not be applied to  the sale of these goods during the week  endingmidnight, November 5th.   The  sale of fireworks was a strictly seasonalbusiness for  an  extremely limited period.  Such goods as were  not soldby  November 5th in one  year  had to lie kept   until the  following year at considerable  loss to the shopkeeper.   The public objected to  havingfireworks on  their  premises longer than  was absolutely  necessary, withthe result that they  would not  purchase  until the last possible moment.It was estimated that 80  per cent, of the fireworks sold were purchasedon November 3rd, 4th and 5th,  and if the weekly half-holiday happened to fall  on November 5th many people  did  not buy at all.  The suspension of the  Early  Closing  Order for  the  sale of  fireworks  during the  week,or even the  three days  ending  at  midnight on November 5th,   wouldhe extremely  valuable to  traders.                     (3) Administrative Authorities.  Association  of  Municipal  Corporations gave evidence  on  behalf of municipal authorities  administering the Acts. AVitness said  that  praeti-cally all the difficulties experienced were caused  by exemptions under theActs of  1920 and  1921 and  their confusion with  Local Early  ClosingOrders  under the  Act of  1912.   Where shops were unaffected by  ClosingOrders under the  Act of 1012 and did not deal in  articles  exempted by
the Acts of 1920 and 1921, tho law was easily ei.forced.   The exemptionsgranted  under the Act of 1921 had  resulted in  more than  one-fifth  ofthe shops that previously  closed at 8 p.m. remaining open till  0.30  p.m.Nearly all  these shops  might be suspected of surreptitious trading, muchof which was  extremely  difficult  to  detect.  The tendency  was  for allshops to close  earlier,  and even  if all restrictions were  withdrawn  wit-ness did  not think they would  go back to the long  hours formerly worked.This was due largely to the habit of shopping in  large centres  rather  thanlocally and  to the shorter  hours worked in  factories and workshops which enabled  most of  the  employees  to  leave  work  by  6 p.m.   The greatmajority of shopkeepers were  in favour of a continuance of  the present restrictions, and  more  than  one half of the  shops closed  voluntarilyat an  earlier  hour than required by the Acts.   The principal objectorswere  those  who, whilst keeping open for the sale of exempted articles,had to close for the sale of non-exempted.   It was alto a source of  annoy-ance to the shopping public to find shops  open for the sale of some  com-modities and closed for the sale of  others.  The  total number  of hoursduring  which  shops  remained open  varied  from 50 to  ICO per week,the longest being in  restaurants  and mixed shops  and  the  shortest  in large drapery establishments,  about 50 hours; licenced  houses,  53;  bootdealers, 57; butchers, 60:  grocers,  62; other shops, 62 to 07; tobacconists,67 to  77;   confectioners,  usually  851; newspapers, sweets and general,80 to  100;  and  restaurants,  SO  to  100.  Licenced houses,  tobacconists,confectioners,  newspapers  and restaurants,  generally open  seven  days a week.  If all shops were required to close at specified hours, the servicesof the policemen on the bent  were essential for  proper enforcement.  Asystem  of   dual  control by  Shops  Inspector and  Police instituted  inBrighton had worked  well.  Under it the Police enforced  the Shops  Act,1920  and 1921, tho Local  Early  Closing  Orders,  and the Inspector theremaining  provisions.   The Association recommended a  uniform  closingfor all shops.   They  recognised  that certain  exemptions must  remainbut  thought that  all  except  those relating to  the  sale of  meals  andrefreshments,  motor accessories and medicines  might be  removed.   they thought  that local  authorities should  have power  to vary  the  closing hour  during holiday periods and in other  special circumstances,  and  thatthere should be  a general suspension for 14 days at Christmas.  Theyhad  no desire to restrict the 6ale of newspapers in the streets.  There  was a general demand  for  the  lengthening of  shop  hours  atholiday  resorts during the season.   Daylight  saving  had  reacted onshopping at such resorts  and the authorities thought they should  havepower of suspension  during  four months  of  the year,  provided  thatthe  interests  of  shop  assistants  were  properly   safeguarded.   It  was within the  knowledge  of the Association that certain holiday resorts didnot  now enforce  the  Act of  1920 during  their  busy season.   Holndaymakers did not desine to be restricted,  and shopkeepers  who had  to depend on  the season  for their  living  desired  the relaxation  of  theAct  during that  period.   On the grounds  of  equality  of trading thesale  of tobacco on  licensed premises after  the  closing  hour  for shopsshould not  be  allowed,  but  the  shorter  licensed hours at  present  inforco to  some oxtent balanced the inequality.  Stallholders at exhibitionswere  in  the main wholesale firms who were there to bring  their goods to the  notice  of  the  public,  and they did  not  seriously compete  withthe retailers of a district, and the public did not usually go to  exhibition-tions to do serious buying.   There  would be no hardship in  allowingthem exemption  from  the Act,  and the  Association  would  favour  a discretionary power  being placed in the hand of local authorities.  Shop-keepers would  be unlikely to  object to the  extonsion being granted. in birmingham tho President of the Grocers&apos;  Association  was among the promoters of an exhibition and Was  in favour of  it.  The County  Councils&apos; Association, representing local authorities  admiu-istering  the Acts in  rural areas, submitted that inasmuch as  it wasthe  primary function  of  the  County  Councils  to  administer  the law
 with impartial regard  for  the interests  of  all county ratepayers,  the -Association felt  unable to  take  sides  as  between  the  shopkeepers and the  public upon  such questions as  the  prohibition  of the sale of certain commodities  after  specified hours and  could  only offer  evidence  on administrative points.  The Association felt that local authorities ndmin- istering the Act should have  power, where  they wero satisfied  that  the change would be acceptable both  to shopkeepers  concerned and  to  the public, to substitute  some  other day of the week for  Saturday  as  tho day  on which shops might  be  kept open  after  8  p.m.   In many  towns and  villages wages wore paid  on  Fffiday, and that  day  would frequently be preferred  by all  concerned.  The desire  for that change was  wide- spread, and in some areas  it  would bo for the convenience of everyone. Tho  Lancashire County Council laid stress on this  point.  The Association  also thought that local authorities should  have some discretionary  power  to  exempt exhibitions  from  the necessity  of stop- ping sales at  8  or  9 p.m.,  as the case might  &apos;be.  The decision  in  the iiolton case(&quot;) made  it clear  that the Act applied to  retail  sales  at exhibitions,  and  the need  for such  power had  boon  found  to  arise particularly  in connection with trade  and other exhibitions.   It  would be extremely difficult to define an exhibition in an Act of Parliament, nnd  for  that  reason it  was  suggested that it should  be  left to local authorities to decide,  after  considering  all  the   circumstances,  whichWere  the  proper cases for exemption.   When the Middlesex County Council  were  thinking  of  preventing  sales  after  8  p.in.  at  Wembley, shop assistants  concerned  wore  horrified  at  the  idea of  interference with  their liberty  to work  and  earn when  the opportunity  offered. Discretionary  power to deal  with special  occasions, such  as race days at Ascot, was also  desired.   Holiday resorts  Quid in  almost  all cases a population  in excess of  20,000, and County Councils were  not con- cerned with  the  administration  of the Acts in them,  but some  power to grant  exemption  from  evening  closing  hours, similar to that already possessed in  regard  to  the  weekly half-holiday, would  be  welcomed.  The Incorporated Society  of  Inspectors of Weights and Measures,  repre- senting 446 members, 191  of whom were appointed  under the Shops Acts as well as under the Weights  and Measures Act, and wore  serving in 53 Boroughs and 31 Counties in England, Scotland and Wales, gave evidence regarding the enforcement of the  Shops Acts.  The experience  of  the members of the Society was  that all the difficulties  encountered in the en- forcement of the Early Closing Acts of 1920 and  1921  arose out  of the exemptions.  Apart  from  the  difficulties created by the fact that there were exemptions of  any kind,  enforcement of  the Acts was complicated by the indefinite phraseology  in  which some of the exemptions were set forth.  He said  the phrase &quot; newly cooked provisions &quot;  was  variously interpreted, somo holding  that  to fall within tho exemption the provisions must be warm when sold, others considering  that  pies and  meats cooked during the day and offered  for sale the same evening although cold were newly cooked. Under existing  conditions a greengrocer  and fruiterer  had to close for the  sale of vegetables  at 8 p.m., at 9.30 for certain fruits, but  could remain open to any hour for the sale of soft fruit.   Three closing hours  operating  in respect  of  one shop or class  of trade  rendered  the enforcement of the Acts  very  difficult.  The requirement  that  the shop would be kept open  and lighted only for such time  as was  necessary for the  serving of a customer after closing time in t)he cases of chemists and garages  was often unworkable.  It was permissible for  all  other traders to keep their shops  lighted after closing  time and there  now  seems to be no  reason why that privilege should be denied to the chemist.  90 pet- cent,  of the  offences against  the Acts were committed in mixed  shops and  the remedy was  to have a  fixed closing hour without any  exemptions or,  if  exemptions must be  allowed, to require a  notice to be exhibited               (*)  Fisher v.  Hovis Bread Co. (not reported).
after tlio earliest closing hour  to  tho effect that  the  shop was closedexcept for the sale of named articles on the lines of the notice required under the Act of 1912, to lie exhibited  in mixed shops on the weekly half-holiday.   A  further  difficulty occurred, particularly  with  hairdressers,owing  to the permission which  all  shopkeepers had to  serve,  after  the closing  hour, customers who entered the shop before that  hour.  cases were known  of hairdressers who  contrived to get so many customers  intotho shop just before  the closing time  that they wero able  to continue busi-iiess for  an hour or  more after that hour.   The difficulty might be over-come by  limiting the time during which such customers might be attendedto.   Butchers aiso often offered temptation to  the public  to purchaseafter hours by  keeping their shops  open and lighted ostensibly  for  thepurpose  of cleaning  down.  The fact  that  many did not do  so proved that it  could be avoided.   Half-an-hour was the  utmost that  should beallowed both  for serving customers  already  in the shop  and for clearing up.  In  Leeds an arrangement had been made with the Chief  Constablewhereby  bis officers reported any offencees against the Early  Closing Actsto the Shops Inspector who took action on the information.  The i.&apos;iml(iii County Council,  the  authority responsible for the admini-stratiou of tho Shops Acts in London outside the City, showed  that frominquiries made by the Council in 1919  among the  shopkeepers in  various districts  of London   with  a view  to obtaining  some  indication  of   thegeneral feeling on the subject of early  closing, it appeared  that of 11.G78shopkeepers of all classes and in all districts who were consulted, only258 were  in  favour of a  return  to unrestricted  trading  hours.   In viewof the present  inquiry the  Council  thought  it  desirable  to  ascertain whether  the  views of London  shopkeepers  on this subject had  changed.Accordingly in April  of the current year, 5.42S shopkeepers, the majoritybeing small traders  in  poor districts,  were again consulted and it  was found that -1,016  wore  in favour of the continuance of  the existing  re-restrictions; 1,138 desired the continuance  of  the present  law  but withcertain  modifications, while  only 274 persons expressed  a desire  for  thetotal  abolition of restrictions.  Traders generally expressed the opinionthat tho public  had  become  accustomed to  the existing hours of closing;that no  increase  of  business would result from an extension  and thatlonger hours,  and, specially in the case of the small trader, would imposeundue  physical strain.  No indication  of any desire on  tho part of  thepublic  for later shopping hours  had readied the  Council either directly or  through  its inspectors.  The information  in   the possession of  theCouncil indicated that, except as regards Sunday evenings, no amendmentof tho law in the  direction of allowing later trading hours  was desired.Persons  engaged in   combined confectionery  and  tobacco businesses  had represented that the hour of closing should he tbe same for both sides of their business.  There was a lack of unanimity  as to  how that shouldbe accomplished, but many  small traders suggested an  extension of  thehours for the sale of tobacco.  On the other hand some suburban tradersregretted the passing of the Act of  1921 and would prefer that  the hours for the  sale of confectionery  should be curtailed rather than that  thehours for the sale of tobacco should  be lengthened. There  was no doubtthat the present position  engendered  some irritation  amongst shop-keepers and the public,  and it arose loss from the  fact that  tobacco couldnot be purchased  after a certain hour than from the  fact  that it couldnot  bo  purchased after that time in  a shop which was  actually open for the sale of other  articles. It appeared that if this class of shop wereolosed as regards both sides of its business at the same time the  irritationfrom that source would be greatly reduced if not entirely avoided.  Froman  administrative point of  view it  was desirable  that the  closing hours for tobacco and confectonery should be  identical.  There was  a  general feeling  among traders dealing  in tobacco  and  confectionery  that   the closing hour on  Sunday  should  bo  fixed  at  a  later hour than 8 p.m.;and 9 p.m. had been frequently suggested.   It hud also been stated that
tho poriod from 0 to 9.30 on weekdays other than Saturday was almostvalueless,. but on  Sunday  evenings  people  were at leisure  and were in-elined to  purchase.  Some traders would regard an extension of an houras cxtremoly valuablo.  The division of fruit  into  two categories  was of  little practical  value and gave rise  to  irritation and difficulty.  The  less scrupulous  tradersstocked a small quantity of soft fruit with  the object of keeping open forother  fruit  and commodities other  than  fruit.  The temptation to  sellan  article that  might be  demanded when  the shop  was open, was  muchgreater than the temptation  to keep a shop  open after the  closing  hour.The abolition  of  the distinction  between the classes of   fruit  seemed desirable.  -Many  shopkeepers had  urged that  the present  classification of icecream was wrong and that it  should be regarded as a refreshment.  Whileadmitting that  there was  some justification for  Hint  view witness saidthat ice cream was sold  by so many traders who had no genuine refresh-ment business that such a change would result  in many shops remainingopen  later, ostensibly  for the  sale of that article,  and  cause  furtheradministrative difficulties.  The Council had not  received any representations indicating  a  general desire for a change  allowing the  sale of  mineral waters  later than  atpresent,  and any such extension would  provide a further opportunity forshopkeepers to keep open for the sale  of  one class  of  goods.  A number of shopkeepers  had expressed  the  view  that the Sundayclosing hour for the sale of confectionery,  ice cream, mineral waters andfruit  should be the same as on  weekdays other than  Saturdays  and somehad indicated  a willingness  to  close at 9 p.m. on those days provided an extension were granted on Sundays.  The exhibition  of a  &quot; mixed  trade  &quot; notice  in the  evening in  shopsopen  for  the sale  of some commodities but closed for the sale of others,might be useful but a  uniform closing hour  for all  shops  was  most desirable.   Most of  the disquiet that  had arisen under these  Acts wastraceable  to the mixed business with varying hours for the sale of differentarticles,  and it was  suggested  that shopkeepers  be required to  declarewhat was their principal  business and to  close their shops at  the hourprescribed for that main  business.  In  some places  trade  was  changing  from  Saturday  to Friday  and  insome  areas Friday might  be more  suitable than Saturday as the latenisht.  Some trader- in  holiday  resorts  might  want  an   extension  oftrading hours  during their  season, but  it  was  doubtful  whether  suchextension was necessary.   Witness could offer no opinion on the questionof the sale  of tobacco and confectionery in theatres.   He did not  thinkthat the  majority of ex-service  men owning one-man  businesses  desiredlonger hours,  but there  was  a minority with no aptitude for retail whoclamoured for  longer hours  when  they were  not doing well.   Tradersas a rule  preferred the  present  type of inspector to police officers, and  inthis kind of work a specialised  officer  did the work more  satisfactorily.The law should be strengthened by  increasing the penalties.  The Glaaqow Corporation said that as the representatives  of the publicthev thought that it was  entirely in the interests of the public and the traders tint the Acts of 1920 and 1921 should be continued, with certain modifications.   From an  administrative point  of  view, it  was desirablethat  the  exemptions under tlie Early Closing  Acts should be reduced,because shops ostensibly open for the  sale of exempted articles were  inthe habit of selling non-exempted  articles after hours, and the  greateruniformity  there was in  the  closing hour  the more easily  could illegali-ties  be detected.  The  greatest difficulty  experienced in enforcing the shops Acts  arose in connection with mixed shops.   For that reason  muchirritation would he removed  if  the  hours  for the sale  of all the  articlesmentioned in the  Act of  1921 wore  restricted to 9 p.m., and tho sale of tobacco allowed up to that hour.  The public were more to blame-than
the shopkeepers  for  ninny of tho breaches  o.&quot;  the  law, and a uniformclosing  hour of 9 p.in.  would better meet  the  public  convenience.  Forthe reasons given tho sale of newspapers would have to be restricted  to p.m.  The  Corporation of Glasgow  owned a large hall  in  which  exhibitionswere periodically held.   Many exhibitors at former exhibitions had repre-bented that it was a hardship not to be allowed to sell after the closing hours for shops.   The Corporation were of opinion that from the  pointof view of all concerned, including  the  shopkeepers, it  would  be  an advantage if stallholders  could  sell  for longer  hours,  and  they saw  nodifficulty  in having  an exemptive  clause which would give  all  localauthorities  the  right to exempt certain  exhibitions on  being satisfiedthat thero was some purpose  behind  the exhibition other than the sellingof goods.   The Corporation had  a direct interest  in this matter, as theylet  the exhibition space  themselves.  Another  source  of  difficulty wasthe growing practice of holding mannequin  parades after  closing hours.These displays  were held in connection  with  the fashionable shops, whichnormally closed earlier than 8 p.m., and no objection  could  be  taken  tothem  so  long  as they  ceased  at  the  recognised  closing  hour.  Theexpression &quot; closed for the serving of customers &quot; implied  the taking ofsome steps to prevent customers  entering  after the closing  hour.   Shop-keepers tisserted  that the displays  were promoted  solely for the enter-tainment  of customers,  but  local authorities had difficulty  in acceptingsuch a  statement and believed that  the shows were held with a view  to obtaining orders.   If orders were taken or goods were  sold after 8  p.in.an offence would  bo committed, but when the display was held after thathour it might take place without the inspector being aware of  it,  or, ifaware  of it, he  might  not  be  admitted,  and  no evidence  that  takingorders or selling  did not occur could be obtained.  In  order to  put thematter  beyond doubt  it was  suggested that  the  words  &quot; for the servingof customers &quot; should  be defined as including  &quot; the  keeping open  of premises  for tho purpose of displaying goods  after  the  usual closing hour.&quot;  A mannequin parade was not analogous to an  exhibition becauseselling the goods  displayed was  the  principal business  of the promoters,while retail sales  were subsidiary to  the main purposes of an exhibition.The enforcement  of  the Acts could  not be  more satisfactorily  or con-veniently carried out by  the police, because the work required  special training,  involved delicate inquiries  requiring the exercise of great  tact,and shopkeepers  would  object to the police  entering their shops for thepurpose.  The  penalties usually  imposed  were insufficient  to act  as a deterrent, and minimum as  well  as  maximum fines should  be prescribed.At  present it often paid the shopkeeper to break the  law.   Evidence  infavour  of a reduction of tho maximum  number  of  hours of employmentof young  persons  was also given.  The Aberdeen  Toicn  Council  submitted a  memorandum on the viewsof  the shopkeepers of  Aberdeen as  ascertained at  a  conference  withrepresentatives of the  Shopkeepers&apos; Associations and  Shop Assistants&apos;Union  and by means of  a questionnaire  circulated to shopkeepers whowere  not  members of Associations.    The general  consensus of opinionexpressed  at  the conference was in favour  of  the present  Acts  beingmade permanent without exemptions,  except for the  sale of medicines,which were urgently  required.   It was also urged  that the sale of anyarticles from automatic machines should be prohibited after the  closing hour  for shops.   Such  sales  were regarded  as  an evasion of the  ShopsActs  and  also as objectionable, in  that they  enabled cigarettes  to  beobtained  by children  who could  not be legally  supplied with them in ashop.   The questionnaire was issued to 795 shopkeepers and replies were received from  661.   Of these, 327 were in favour of  the  present  or  an earlier compulsory closing hour.  24 favoured  later compulsory closing,and 273 were in  favour of the removal of all restrictions.   Papers werespoilt  in  37 cases.
  The  llridlinylon  Corporation gave evidence in favour of the modifies-tion of  tlie Early  Closing Acts so  that they  could &apos;be  suspended orrelaxed  in  holiday  reports during the summer season in the same way as the provisions of the Shops Act, 1912, relating to the closing of shopsfor the  weekly half-holiday,  could  be suspended  by Order of  tho LocalAuthority.  The Council  felt that the  principle of  suspending closingrestrictions having been  admitted in  the case  of  tho half-holiday  itmight  lie applied to evening closing.   The local  authority of  a  holidayresort  knew, or  ought *o  know, the  needs of the place and should, asthe elected representatives of  the ratepayers,  have  power to make anOrder  allowing shops, or  certain classes  of  shops,  to keep open later than the hours at  present fixed,  subject, if  thought  necessary,  to con-ditioius safeguarding  the  assistants.   Shopkeepers  at pleasure   resortsrelied  on the  season to make their living, and  it was a great  hardship,particularly to small  shopkeepers,  to  be compelled  to close  their  shopsearly  whilst there  were  visitors  in  the  town.   There  was  a genuinedemand  on the part of the public to be able to purchase certain  classesof goods after the  present closing hours, and the Councils attitude wasinspired primarily  by  a desire  to help the  shopkeepers and, secondly,to  accommodate visitors  to the  town,  and,  thirdly,  in  the interestof the Corporation  in running the Spa and Parade.   They thought thatthe Shops Acts ought  not to, apply to such  places of amusement.  the staffs at such  places were already employed  after the closing  hours forshops  and  could easily sell  such things  as  tobacco  and  confectionerywithout  increasing their hours of labour.  A considerable amount of busi-ness which might  lie  done at such places in the summer  evenings wasprevented  by   the  present  state of the  law.  The closing  hour for con-foctioners,  tobacconists,  toy  and  fancy  goods  dealers should  not lieearlier  than 10 p.m.   As  showing the general nature of the  dislike of early closing  among the  shopkeepers  of Bridlington,  witness  said  thatin 1912 the Council took steps to make  a  Closing Order  under Section 5of the Act of 1912 fixing the  closing hours  at  7.30  on ,weekdays  otherthan  Saturday and 10 p.m. on  Saturday during  the  winter months.but  at that  time   they  received  so  many representations against theproposal that  they had to  abandon  it.  During the  previous week amemorandum  had  been received at the Town  Clerk&apos;s  Office, signed byabout  100 shopkeepers  out of  a total  of about  550,  urging the desir-ability  in   their interest  of  amending  the  Early Closing  Acts in themanner already indicated. There was no representative organisation oftradesmen in  the town through which their views could be ascertained.The Council were  supported  by the local Press in their attitude  in thematter.  It was the considered  opinion  of the members of the Council,as the elected representatives of the ratepayers, that the modifications of the  Act which  had  been  indicated  were  desirable.   Their proposals had been discussed at public  council meetings, and not a single obection had  been received  from any  shor keeper.  The  Northern and  Midland  Market  Authorities Association,  repre-senting  109  municipal  authorities  owning  markets,  gave evidence on  the question of the operation of the Shops Acts  in  markets.   a questionnaire   had   been  circulated to  all  constituent Authorities andreplies  had been  received from 83  of  the  109.  A questionnaire was designed to ascertain  to  what extent stalls in markets were a&apos;1&apos;ectcd byClosing Orders under  the 1912 Act and  whether the  partial  closing had any detrimental effect on the business  of the other stalls; whether anyeffort  had  been  made to  exclude  the  market  from  the  provisions ofClosing Orders and whether, in cases where the principal market daywas  not Saturday, an  alternative late night  would  be an  advantage to the traders or  the  public.  The replies indicated that 55  per cent.of the  markets were not affected hy  Closing  Orders.  Cf the. remaining&quot;44 percent.,  representing 3G markets,  the  Authorities  m 25  cases didnot consider that the earlier closing  of  certain stalls had  a  detrimental
211effect on the business  of  the remainder, and  in 11 eases they thoughtit did.   A  number  of  Authorities  whose principal  or only market day-was  other than  Saturday  thought it would  bo an advantage both  totraders and  to the public if local authorities could, at their  discretion,fix some day other than  Saturday  for the later  closing of shops.  Therewas  no  reason  to think  that the  public  were inconvenienced  by  theshortening of shop hours  except  in  regard  to  the  late night.  The  onlydifficulty experienced was  in  regard to enforcement, particularly in openmarkets  where some stalls must close at  S p.m. and others could remain open longer.  It  was easier in an enclosed market, but it was impossibleto carry out tho Orders so that shopping ceased exactly  at the specifiedhour, and  people  inside the  market were often served after the closing hour.  Stallholders could  not claim the  privilege with shopkeepers  whowere  permitted  to serve  customers  after the  closing hour if  they  had entered his premises before tho hour.  They were allowed a short periodof grace in some cases, but in others the officials &quot;would  not permit anybuying at  all.after the specified hour.  The National Amalgamated Union of Shop  Assistants,  Warehousemenami Clerks,  having a  membership of 6o,0tX) persons engaged as wage-earners  in  the distributive  trades,  gave  evidence  in  favour  of  thecontinuance  on a permanent basis of the  General Early  Closing  Order.Shop assistants desired  a permanent  measure  in  order  to  avoid the uncertainty as to their  position from year  to  year  which existed under the  present  arrangements.  They  were convinced that  the abolition  of restrictions would lead  to some shopkeepers  reverting almost immediately to the  very  late  hours  which operated before the  War.  Though suchshopkeepers  might not  at  first  be numerous or the employers  of largestaffs, their  later  closing would, in time, force the  larger shops to keepopen later in order to meet the unfair competition.  A general extensionof working   hours  would  thus result without  any  roal  desire  on  thepart of the public or of  the majority  of shopkeepers and entirely againstthe  wishes  of the  assistants whose  working  hours  would  be  greatly  The public had  become accustomed to shopping  earlier,  had  realised that  by so  doing they obtained lietter attention  and were  left  with more leisure at a time  of day  when  leisure was  most  desirable, and did not desire any extension of hours.   In their efforts to  obtain  Local Closing Orders or to  make voluntary  arrangements  tor  earlier  hours the assistants  had been supported by the  public headed in some  cases by Mayors and other prominent  citizens.  It had never been contended that  the well-to-do classes  desired late shopping, but  it was frequently- urged that  early  closing  inflicted hardship  on the  poorer classes.  That statement was untrue.  In  their efforts to obtain  earlier closing,   shop assistants had the support  of all organised workers,  and the  Co-opera- tive Societies, which,  in  the main,  supplied the  needs  of the poorer classes and   were  entirely  governed  by their members, generally closed earlier  than the  present  statutory  hours.   Experience gained  over a long period  of working with individual employers and Employers&apos;  Asso-ciations had proved  that  with  very few exceptions  shopkeepers them-selves favoured earlier closing  hours than  those  at  present  in force. From the shopkeepers&apos; point of view earlier  closing tended to economy in the conduct of their businesses without prejudice  to  the volume  oftrade done.  The  argument  that  the restrictions constituted a hardship to the  one-man  shopkeeper, whether ex-service or not,  was based on a fallacy.  The purchasing  power of the  public was  not  increased bylonger hours and, provided  that  a Closing  Order is of general  applica-tion and properly administered  so that there is no unfair  competitionthrough shops  remaining opon  when he is  compelled  to closo, the  one-man shopkeeper can  enjoy  the advantages of early closing  without loss(4) Shop Assistant.&apos;.increased.nanrnm
 of turnover.  The failure of so many one-man businesses which had been established since  tho war  was  due to  the proprietors&apos;  lack  of  know- ledge of the principles of retail  trading  and shop  management,  and not  to  early  closing.  Tho existing  Acts  had  undoubtedly  effected a reduction in  the  working  hours of assistants,  but there  remained  the serious grievance that they  might be kept at work, and in fact frequently wero  so  kept,  after shops wore closed and for the better  protection of shop assistants, particularly  women and girls,  the Union  urged  the legal  limitation of hours of  work  to  48 per week  in conjunction with the  compulsory  closing of shops.  The  suggestion   that  shops  might be kept  open  indefinitely   and  a shift system  introduced  was  in  their view  both undesirable  and  impracticable.  Such  a  system  involved irregular working hours.   Hours off  during the  day  lost 90 per  cent. of their  value.  Tho necessity  for  continuity  in connection  with cash receipts and  other  things  which did  not  arise in  factories  made the shift system in  shops impracticable  from the employers&apos; point  of view.   The  Union  urged  the continuance  of  a General  Closing Order but thought the present  Order  should  bo  amended  in  respect- of  the hours fixed and the exemptions allowed.   An Order fixing 7  p.in.  as tho closing hour on four  nights and 8 p.in.  on  the late  night would adequately meet present day needs.  The  tendency for late shopping to  be done  on Friday instead of  on  Saturday  was increasing and they  hoped  any permanent Order would allow an alternative*to Saturday as the  late closing  night. The  list of exemptions  might bo considerably reduced so  as  to include only  those classes of goods which wore  likely to  be required iu an eiuer- geucy and might well be limited to  refreshments for consumption on the premises;  medicines and motor and aircraft accessories.  It was  rceog- nisod  that  tho  present  exemptions  wore intended  to  confer benefits  on the public but  they  had only resulted  in causing annoyance and irritation- tion.  &apos;iuey had complicated the  work  of  administration and often  led to ridicule and contempt  for the  law.  Suspension   of  the  Order was necessary only  for Christmas  week.  No other  holiday  season  produced a  volume of trade sufficient to necessitate extended  trading hours.  The Act of 1921 had  increased  the working  hours of assistants not only in the confectionery trade  but  in other trades  by increasing the number of mixed shops.   Theatres  should conform  to shop  hours  in  the  matter of the sale of confectionery  and  tobacco as  they had to do  in the  case of the sale of intoxicating liquors.   The National Union of Distributive  aud Allied Workers, representing approximately 96,000 members the majority of  whom  were employed  by the Co-operative Societies,  gave evidence generally supporting  the views expressed  by  the National Amalgamated  Union  of  Shop  Assistants. Their experience  was that  without  the compelling force of a generally applicable early closing  law ib  was impossible  to safeguard the health and comfort of  those engaged in retail distribution, and  they  hoped theexisting law would be strengthened. Tho principle of  early closing had been  applied with great success for upwards  of 10 years.  The public had become accustomed to earlier closing,  the great  majority of shopkeepers and all the  assistants were in  favour of it and the Union urged that theprinciple of general early closing  should bo embodied in permanent legis- lation and applied so as  to  fix the latest closing times for all  shops.  Ifany exemptions were  allowed they should be only  in  respect of cases of real emergency.  The Co-operative Societies had nearly 5,000,000 members, representing a  population of probably 20,000,000 persons, they catered for  classes ofcustomers in respect of whom  shopping convenience had always requiredspecial consideration,  and yet they  were able to close their &quot;shops con-siderably earlier than the hours  at  present fixed by  law.   The closing hours  of  456  Societies  on   the several  days of the  week  showed  thatoxcept  on  Friday a  very  substantial  majority closed their  shops  at p.m. or earlier,  and what was practical  for the co-operative societies
 should be  possible  for  tho general shopkeepers  of the  country.  The compulsory  hour should  be amended  to 7  p.m.  ou days  other  than Saturday and S p.m. on  Saturdays.   Exceptions should  be allowed  only in eases of  real emergency, such as medical  supplies,  but they  agreed that  one  late night was  necessary and thought it should  be either Friday or Saturday.  Power should  be given to local authorities to make Closing Orders  under  the Act  of  1912  for  earlier  hours  than those generally prescribed, and  assistants as well as shopkeepers should  have the light to vote on the question.  They  agreed that there was need for the statutory  limitation of the hours of  labour of assistants in addition to the closing of shops.   The Journeymen  Butchers&apos;  Federation  of Great  Britain, representing approximately 10,000 members employed  in  the  wholesale  meat markets and  retail  butchers&apos; shops of  England  and  Wales,  gave evidence  in substantial  agreement  with  that  given  by  the National  Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and  Clerks  and the National Union of Distributive  and Allied Workers.   They  desired a  permanent general Early Closing Order fixing  the closing hours at 7 p.in.  (S  p.in. on Saturdays), with a minimum  of exemptions, and favoured the estab- lishment  of  a legal -IS-hour  week  for  shop  assistants  in addition  to early  closing.  The  Federation would  welcome  local option  as   to the late night.   The Retail  Book, Stationery and  Allied Trade  Employees&apos;  Association were also iu general agreement with the  evidence  given by the National Amalgamated  Union of  Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks.   Organisations vf Women. The Standing Joint  Committee of Industrial Women-s Organisations claimed to represent all organised  women  exceed- ing a  million  in  number, for the  most  part  women  who  were  not themselves wage-earners.  The  people for  whom  they spoke formed the bulk of the ordinary shopping public, and as far as they were concerned there-was no necessity for longer  hours.  There  might be  inconvenience in individual  cases but  it  could be  overcome  by  forethought.   The witnesses also  called attention  to the hardship to,  and deleterious effect upou the  health  of  women and girls who were employed for long hours in  shops.   The Edinburgh  Juvenile Organisations&apos; Committee,  the  Edinburgh Women Citizen&apos;s Associations,  and the Scottish  Standing  Committee of the National  Council of Women  gave evidence regarding  conditions of employment in the catering trade and urged the necessity  of regulating the hours of employees  in exempted shops.  The hours in the catering establishments  were too  long.  The3-  varied from 44 to  70 hours a week. In some cases  the days stretch  out for a  period of 15 hours.   All  estab- lishmonts  open for  more than  12  hours should  be run on  two separate shifts  as is  the practice in railway restaurants.   The Scottish Council  for Women&apos;s Trades,  a society existing for  the social and industrial advancement of women and girls, also gave evidence. Witnesses said  that the Council had given close attention to the question of the employment of -women in shops  and had made inquiries covering some  thousands of  cases.   Knowing the  conditions under which shop assistants  had  to work before the Early Closing Regulations were intro- duced  the  Council  viewed with apprehension  any possibility  of those regulations  being relaxed.  Owing to the  varied  circumstances  under which  retail  trade was  carried  on and the  nature  of the competitioncombination among those engaged in  it, it was difficult, and the council was convinced that any  fair standard of conditions could be maintainedonly by means of legislation.  Statistics collected in the course of investi-gations recently carried out by the Council showed that the hours duringwhich composite shops remained open  were still very long, often reaching,and sometimes exceeding,  90 to 100  per week.   The fact that some ofthe articles sold in these mixed shops enjoyed exemption from the ordinaryregulations led to breaches of the law.   Tho varying hours up to  which
different  articles might be sold caused confusion in  tho  minds of  bothshopkeepers  and public and often presented  tho shopkeepers with  thealternative of choosing between  breaking  the law and offending their customers.  Shopkeepers felt that if the restriction to 8 p.m. was quitegeneral  it would not  harm  them, but  they  complained of the  unfair competition of mixed shops which remained open for the sale of exemptedarticles  but  sold non-exempted  goods after &apos;-he legal hours.  In  thisrespect the  &quot; ice cream  shops &quot; of Glasgow,  which  were registered  asplaces of refreshment  under the  Burgh  Police  (Scotland) Acts (a) and could  remain open until  a lato hour  for the sale of  refreshments,  wereparticular offenders.   It  was also suggested that these shops exerted  a.batl moral influence on juveniles  who frequented them.  A large numberof prosecutions were undertaken for breaches of tho law but the penaltiesimposed were  insufficient  to act as a deterrent.  The Council  thoughtthat all these matters could best bo dealt with by  means of  a consolidatingand amending Shops Act which should include the making permanent ofthe time limit imposed by tho Act of 1920, the repeal  of the Act of 1921,increased  penalties  for breaches of the  law,  and  the  definition  and regulation of &quot; ice cream shops.&quot;                       (5) The General Public.   In  a matter of this  kind the public is unorganised and consequentlyinarticulate,  and it was difficult to obtain any  direct evidence as to then-views.  Indirect  evidence  of some dissatisfaction on  tho part of certain sections  of the general public  was given by witnesses on behalf  of theLicensed  Victuallers, -who said that  their customers  were insistent  indemanding cigarettes  after 8  p.m.  and  it  was  very  difficult to avoidbreaches  of  the  law.   Witnesses on  behalf of the theatre and cinemaproprietors spoke of  the constant irritation caused to the public  by therestriction at present placed on the sale of tobacco and confectionery  in places of amusement, and  the indignation and  amazement  of foreign visitors-tors on finding that these  articles were unobtainable in this country after certain fixed hours.   A  witness representing the Glasgow Corporationconsidered that there was  a substantial demand on the part of the  public to be served  with certain  articles after the closing hour and said that  insome cases shopkeepers were compelled by their customers to break the law.Individual members of  the public gave evidence  that the present restric-tions on retail trading inflicted inconvenience and hardship on workers whowere employed until 6 pan. or later and had  no.one  to do shopping forthem.  Mr.&quot;  F.  A.  Macquisten,  K.C.,   M.P.,  urged  that  the  EarlyClosing  movement  was mainly a  movement in  the  interest of the  bigstores and multiple combines  and that restrictive agitation  was largelyorganised  by  big  businesses.   The  great  bulk of  evidence tenderedbefore  the Committee was &quot;  organised &quot;  evidence,  got  up  by  people who  were interested in continuing these restrictions and little  weight should  he  attached  to  it.   The innumerable &quot; small &quot; men who wanted to  start  shops and  the  small shopkeepers  were unorganised and hadno means of expressing their opinion  in  public.  The  restricted shoppinghours prevent shop  assistants from starting  shops on  their own  account.If  complete  liberty  were  given to  the  shopkeeper  and  his  familyto  carry on  business it would result in a great  reduction in the cost ofliving.   There would be  called into existence a  great  number  of shops and it  would be impossible to  organise  price  combinations  as was  done at present.    There  was  a large number of ex-sorvice men and  otherscomplaining  bitterly that  owing  to the  shop hours  restrictions  it wasimpossible for thorn to  make a  living, and their  business  was beingdriven  into  the  hands of  thes  multiple shopkeepers  and  the  big  stores.Mrs  A.  Burrell,  a  Poor  Law  Guardian, and a member of  variousbodies, speaking from  her experience and  that of others in  the  courseof  her  public  duties, submitted  that  the present restrictions on  retail(*) 3 Edw. 7, Ch. 33.   1 and 2 Geo. 5, Ch. 51.
trading   inflicted   inconvenience  and   hardship  not only  on  tradersthemselves, but also on all grades of workers  who were  employed  until6 p.m. or later,  and had  no one   to   do shopping for them.   the restricted  hours favour large stores  and  multiple shops,  and  if  tradingpassed  entirely into  their hands  prices  would rise  and  cost  of livingcould not  fall.    The  public  were inconvenienced  in purchasing noces-saries by the closing  of  all shops,  more  particularly  in cases  of  suddenor  unexpected  demands.    Mr.  Harry  Becker,  formerly M.I\, wh,ohud introduced amending  Bills  on  tho subject  of shop hours in 1922-23,was brought in contact with  a  large number of small shopkeepers, andwas satisfied  that there was a strong demand  by  the public  and  smallshopkeepers  for  unrestricted hours,  while  safeguarding  tho  hours ofemployment  of shop  assistants.  A  man  in  his  own  business, providedho  employed no one else,  should not bo  restricted  in his  keeping open.The  present  restriction  favoured  the  multiple shops  who  Vamployedmanagers.   They  took  no  part  in the civic  life   in  the  town  andlocal   administration  was   adversely affected.    The  retail   trade   is extremely  prosperous, and  could  well   afford  to  run   two   shifts  ofassistants.   The  shop  assistants could have  their  hours  rogulatcd,and  legal restrictions  of  shop  hours   should  be  abolished.    Earlyclosing  tended  to  deprive the  working classes  of  cheap  food.    Ifallowed to remain open till  a  later  hour, many  shopkeepers would  buy-larger stocks  and  reduce  prices  later at  night in order  to clear them.  The National Citizens&apos;  Union having  140 branches  and representingbetween  40,000  and 50,000 members, said that  the  public regarded therestrictions on  the sale  of  certain   commodities at  places  of  amuse-ment as vexatious  and desired  their removal.   The  only  justification for  tho  restrictions  was  the protection   of  employees, and as theatreattendants were  required  to be on  duty throughout  the performance,no hardship would be  inflicted  by their removal.   The Union,  as repre-senting consumers,  favoured  the abolition  of  all  restrictions  and  theintroduction  of a shift  system  in  shops.   If, however, the removalof the  restrictions  involved  additional  hours  of  labour   for  shop assistants,  they should be  continued.(64768) Wt.St  12/27  II. St. G.7I
