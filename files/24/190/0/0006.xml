CABINET                FOREST POLICY.   Memorandum by the Forestry Commissioners.(Circulated by direotlon of the Prime Minister). 1.   The Commissioners prepared for circulation  in February last the appended memorandum stating certain facts,  which in their opinion,  should govern future Forest Policy.  The memorandum has now been brought up to date.      Attention is drawn to the following points:- (a)   The current State Forestry programme is an  instalment        of a larger Policy adopted in 1919 (para.  2). (b)   The planting accomplished in the first decade will         oorrespond fairly closely with the prescribed         area (para. 4). (c)   In addition substantial progress has been made with         the promotion of forest workers&apos;  holdings (para. 5). (d)   The cost to the Exchequer will be that estimated for         in 1919 (para. 6). (e)   The existing woodlands of the country are in a         thoroughly unsatisfactory state.   The rate gf         reconstructing them is inadequate and it  is         necessary to plant more hardwoods (oak)         (paras. 7 and 8). (f)   If the position is to be remedied the main burden         will fall on the State (paras. 9 and 10). (g)   The position with regard  to the world supplies *f         coniferous timber is disquieting (para.  12). (h)   It is suggested that the State planting programme         for the decade 1929/39 should lie between a         maximum of 550,000 aores and a minimum of 330,000         aores (paras. 13 and 14). fi)   It is important that the existing uneoonomio         woodland areas should  be replantred (para. 14).
2.   In the meantime preliminary estimates have &quot;beenprepared and the appended memorandum has been the  subjeotof discussion between the Chanoellor of the Exchequer andthe Treasury on the cne hand and the Forestry ComaisBionerson the ether.  As a result the Chanoellor has intimated his decision tbhat the amount of money which the Exchequer canprcvide over the ten-year period 1929/39 is limited te 5^- millions in approximately equal annual instalments.3.   To oarry out the Commissioners&apos; minimum planting programme (330,000 acres) including a balanced EorestWorkers1 Holding Schome, the Exohequer -would have to provideapproximately  8 millions.     The table below shows, in round figures, the workwhich could be done with  5^,  6 and  8 millions.

They do not oontend that a polioy onoe laid down should beimmutable.  It may in special ciroumstances be necessary toadopt a short-range programme tihioh is admittedly inadequate,but a general polioy onoe adopted should not be sorappedwithout full consideration.     The Commissioners suggest, therofore, that the positionbe now oonsidered in two stages, namely, -     fl)  General Policy....     (s)  The Programme (being an instalment of Policy)             which tho country is in a position to undertake.     5.   In order to provide material for a decision theCommissioners submit the following outline whi ch deals with -     fl)  General Policy;     (2)  Tho Programme for the deoade 1929/39 (figures             to be inserted), and     (3)  Certain constitutional matters which have             attracted attention in Parliament.                   OUTLINE OF FOREST POLICY.                     1.  General Policy.1.   To promote the steady afforestation of the uncultivatedland of the Country and the improvement of existing woodlandsso as to ensure a supply of home grown timber  (both coniferousand broadleaved) adequate for     (a)  The normal well-being of the nation.     (b)  Safety in time of national emergency.2.   The ultimate objectives are those laid down in theReport of the Forestry Sub-Committee of tho Re-constructionCommittee of the Cabinet  (cd. 8881), viz.     (i)  The maintenance of the then existing 3,000,000 -            acres of woodland in a productive state, and    (ii)  The addition thereto by afforestation of a further            1,770,000 aores in the oourse of 80  -years.
        3.   In association with Forestry and Afforestation to provide        holdings for the forest workers under sound eoonomio conditions        and thus to assist in the permanent  settlement of rural        workers on the land.             II.  Programme for,, &quot;the decade 1929-1939.        4.   There will be made available for the Forestry Fund from        the Exchequer a total sum of a:... millions in approximately        eoual annual instalments.  Tho amount of this sum is condi-        tioned by the financial state of the Country.        5.   This money, together v/ith working reoeipts, will he used:        (a)  In acquiring,  by lease or purchase, suitabls planting               land and land for forest workers1 holdings.        (b)  In planting and re-planting approximately ...... acres.        fc)  In developing the forests and land already vested in               the Forestry Commissioners..        (d)  In promoting forestry by means of grants to Corporate               bodies and private individuals for planting, etc.        fe)  In promoting education,  including grants to teaching               bodies, and  also in conducting schools for forest               apprentices.        (f)  For Research and experiment, publications and various               incidental purposes.        (g)  In the establishment and maintenance of forest workers1               holdings, of which.......will be laid down.                           III.  Constitution.       6.    In order to provide a liaison between the Government of       the day and the Commissioners a (Junior Lord of the Treasury)       will be appointed an unpaid Commissioner and will answer for       the Commission in tho House of Commons.       7.    In order to secure continuity in administration the term       of office of Commissioners will be increased from five to ten       years,  half their number retiring (but remaining eligible for       re-appointment) at 5-y-ar intervals.       8.    Arrangements will be made to review the past work of the       Commissioners and to provide a further instalment of policy       some reasonable time before the end of the deoade.Forestry Commission,    22 Grosvenor Gardens,  S.W.1.  28th November,  1927.
        ME.IORAE.&apos;DT.KI Oil FOREST POLICY.     The Financial clause of the Forestry Act 1919 expireson March 31st 1929 and fresh legislation will be necessaryearly in 1928,     An immediate instruction is required as to GeneralPolicy and tho Programme for 1929-39 in order that thedetails of work and costs may be worked out and that adequate provision may bo made for staff, acquisition ofland, provision of plants and&apos;similar subjocts for whichpreparatory steps have to be taken two or more years inadvance.     Basis of Forest Policym1919 - 1929.     The bssis of current policy, which was accepted byparliament in 1919, is the Report3&quot; of the Forestry Sub-Committee of 1916/17.   The country was to be made self-supporting in an emergency not exceeding 3 years&apos;duration, which entailed maintaining in a productivestate the 3,000,000 acres of existing forest andafforesting a further 1,770,000 acres with conifers.   the underlying principle was that the State should undertakesuch part  of the programme as private and corporateenterprise failed to accomplish-     The main proposals were as follows:-     Total to be afforested with             1,770,000 acres.       conifers in 80 years     To be afforested with conifers          1,180,000   &quot;       in first 40 years     To bo planted in first 10 years:-              Conifers.     fl) Afforestation on Sti-te-acquired           land                                150,000     (2) Afforestation on Municipal           and Private Land                     50.000                  Total afforestation   &apos;       200,000     (3) Replanting - Municipal and Private     50,. COO           Total conifers to be planted        2507000x Report of Forestry Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction  Committee, Cd. 8881.
Hardwoods.Area to be planted not specified.Finance:  The Forestry Act 1919 provided for  3^-million plus working receipts to be appropriated for the10year period to tho &quot;Forestry Fund&quot; which was to be drawnony annual votes.This Fund was to serve as well forancillary subjects such as Research,  Education,  &amp;c.4.     250,000 acres in all will have been planted in Great Britain.     Of this area 229.000 ecres nay be credited to the Forestry     Fund.   The Commissioners will have planted 142.000 acres in     all (137,000 acres conifers and 5,000 acres hardwoods)  and     will thus be 13,000 acres short on their conifer programme.     The area planted with the aid of grants is estimated at 07,000     acres.   In addition some 21,000 acres will have been planted     by private owners without the aid of grants.          The State programme has been steadily pursued except for     two years1 check following the Ueport of the Geddes Committee.     In one respect there has been an important departure.   The     area replanted bears a higher proportion than was intended to     the area newly afforested.   This is justified on the ground     that war fellings were on a much greater scale than was     anticipated by the Reconstruction Committee.5.        Forogt Workers&apos; Holdings:  Approximately 750 Holdings     equipped with houses and outbuildings will be completed,  or     in course of completion, by April,  1929.   The additional     duty of pi-oviding Holdings for Forest Workers was placed upon     the Commission in 1924.     32 Apart from their main work of afforestation the Commissioners     have taken over and worked the former Crown Forests and wood-     lands and have carried out an extensive programme of research     and education-   Forestry in the Empire has been advanced by     two Imperial Conferences and by preparations for a third  and     also by the establishment of the Imperial Forestry Institute     at Oxford.   A census of the woodlands of Great  Brit?:in has     been completed and a census of Prodiiotion is Bearing completion.
    This is now regarded as a very important part of any Forest    Policy, but as no special funds were provided for this purpose    the cost has come out of the Forestry Fund end has had an effect    in reducing the area planted in the present decade.i.        Finance:  The total net expenditure for the ten years will    be within the sum of  3,500,000 provided under the Forestry    Act, 1919.   Forest Workers1 Holdings, which were not included    in the original estimate, account for  312,000 of this total while     430,000 was expended on work, which was not fully productive,    for the relief of tin employment.                Facts bearing on Future Policy.&apos;.        The Census figures, of which a preliminary summary is given    below, provide the first accurate data for British woodlands.    They disclose a far more unsatisfactory state of affairs than    the Forestry Sub-Committee counted on in drawing up their plans    in 1916/17.

8.        The Census of Woodlands da La may he interpreted in     the following way;        (a)  productive and Hon-productive Woodland:   Of the -     total area of 2,958,630 acres of woodland less than half     (1,416,070 acres of High forest) is reasonably productive;     of the  rest 800,800 acres of scrub and foiled are from the     forestry point of view, idle land, 528,670 acres of     coppice and coppice with standards have a very low average     productivity, while 204,290. corns of amenity and similar     woodlands arc- definitely uneconomic in the sense that they     are outside the scope of commercial forestry.        (b)  Pre-war and Post-war Preserves of Timber:   At the     outbreak of war there existed,  fortunately,  a large excess,     (compared with a normal distribution of age  classes) of     old timber, both coniferous and oak.   On a  rough estimate     450,000 - 500,000 acres mainly conifers, were felled during     and immediately after the war.          The immediate outlook is serious.  . There  remain     70,330  acres of conifers and 77,180 acres of indifferent     mixed woods over 80 years (equivalent to about  9 months1     consumption of saw timber) which so far as it is accessible     will probably be felled during  the next few  years.    The     coniferous woods (244,520 acres) and the mixed  woods     (134,410 acres) now 41 - 80 years old, which would normally     replace the pre-war reserve,  are being felled for revenue.     Behind  them again there are only 153,940 acres  of conifers     and 63,430 acres mixed woods 21 - 40 years old.          It is a fair assumption on these figures that  the     position as regards reserves of standing coniferous timber     will steadily grow worse until  the post-war  plantings begin     to become effective.        (c)  Hardwoods:   While there  is at present  a  large supply     of second and third class hardwoods (oak)  in  the country                         - 8 -
     the outlook for a sustained supply of good oak is very had.     Oak planting has now almost ceased and this, combined with     failure over the last 40 years to plant on anything     approaching an adequate scale, means that ultimately the     supply of mature oak must cease.   The existing large area     of oak over 80 years (208,230 acres) will gradually be     felled for revenue and if regenerated at all will be     replanted with conifers.            Rate of Ho const ruction;  Private planting has     averaged over the last 40 years about 12,000 acres per     annum and is still proceeding at approximately that rate.     The Commissioners&apos; programme for the current and next     season (9th and 10th years) is 23,000 acres.          Private planting, at best, will not do more then cope     with current fellings&quot;?   A State programme of 23,000 acres     per annum would plant up the existing felled area (478,100  *   acres) or an equivalent area in 21 years and the combined     felled area and scrub (800,000 acres) or their equivalent     area in 36 years.          The Forestry Sub-Committee in their calculations of     1916/17 assumed that the 3,000,000 acres of existing     woodlands would be maintained in a productive state and     proposed to add 1,770,000 acres of new forest,.   Unless     State planting is speeded up to a rate above 30.000 acres     per annum there will not be 3.000,000 acres of productive     forest in the country before 1955.9.        It is concluded        (1) That while there is a good case for speeding up the     rate of planting conifers it is also essential to increase     very considerably the rate of planting hardwoods.        (2) That municipal and private landowners are not pulling     nor likely in the future to pull their weight.    More     - This is an optimistic statement.    The probability ip that       with the continued high taxation and the break up of       estates fcllingc will greatly exceed replantings.                            - 9 -
      energetic State action is consequently necessary.           Facts for and against more energetic State action.10.      (a) An Essential Service:   The btsis of State action  is      assumed to be the necessity of carrying on an essential      service which private enterprise will not undertake  on an      adequate scale.   This is the case with forestry and      afforestation.         (b) The Commission^ Experience:  The seven years1      experience - of tho Commissioners shows that tho technical      difficulties connected with large scale planting can be      overcome and that reliable estimates of cost can be      furnished.         (c) Eome  grown Timber:   Much data as to the rate  of      growth of timber in this country have been collected and      indicate that production is at least as high on the      average as in Germany and in France and in favoured      localities very much  higher.    Rome grown timber when      properly sawn,  seasoned and marketed is suitable for all      ordinary commercial purposes.         (d) labour or ifaral Settlement:   The amount of  labour      which the  Commissioners can employ increases with  the      area  under forest.    This  year&apos;s planting programme  of      23,000 acres will provide  work for  from 3,000 to 3,500 men      during the winter months.   V/hile Forestry employment  may      never amount to any large  percentage ox the total  labour      in  the country,  it  gives a new source  of employment  and      will  have  considerable effect  in keeping men in  rural      districts.    The Holdings  Scheme associated with      afforestation is an effective  and  cheap method  of  rural      settlement.         (e)  Popular  suppo rt:  Afforestation  is  popular  and  the      Commissioners  havs  received almost  universal  expressions      of  goodwill.    The main criticism has been directed  against
                                                                     9                                                                     d      the snail scale on which operations are conducted. 11.        On the other hand there are two main facts to be      placed&quot; egainst State action.         (a) She iiiitial out lay, which, nevertheless, is      productive and on existing timber prices should give a      direct financial return of &amp;jfio to 4$.   There is every      probability that timber prices will increase substantially.         (b) The acquisition of land entails disturbance of      existing occupation.   The difficulty of securing suitable      land has already begun to hamper the Commissioners1      operations.   It is a pertinent question,  however, whether      such large areas of so-called woodland (para. 0 a) should      be permitted to remain in inefficient occupation.   The      same consideration applies in varying measure to several      million acres of rough grasing and land devoted to sport.           The utilisation of these types of land appears to      call for rural planting almost as urgently as does that of      urban land for town planning.12.        World Softwood Supply:   Ho discussion of forest Policy      can be complete, however, without taking note of the      disquieting position with regard to the world1s supplies of      coniferous timber and the advisability of establishing in      this, the largest importing country, a timber industry      which will provide from year to year a substantial out-      turn to meet the needs of industry.                       Conclusion.13.        If an ordered scheme is to proceed during the 10 year      period 1929-39 detailed plans and estimates shou3d be      prepared at once.    The Commissioners consequently require      general instructions on Policy including the financial      provision which the Cabinet  feel that the  country should                         - 11 -
make, and the attitude to be adopted towards the land required for forestry.     In the meantime they venture to emphasise two points:   (1) That tho State planting- programme for the decade1929-39 might, lie between the following limits:                                         M K minimun.  Minimum,                                         &quot;acres      &quot;acres&quot;               Coniferous plantations    500,000   300,000               Hardwood       . &quot;          50,000    30,000                            Totals       550,000   330,000     The minimum programme will at least make a justcontribution towards the 40-year Scheme  (l;100,000 acres)of the Itooonotruction Committee.   The maximum is necessary if the devastated areas and the woodlands classed as non-productive in the census of woodlands are to be made goodwithin the next half century.
