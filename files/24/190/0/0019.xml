SECRET.                                                    Copy No.     100159-D.Final Copy.(Also Paper 1.1.A. 8.)COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.SUB-COMMITTEE ON THE INDIANISATION  OF  THE  INDIAN ARMY.                                  REPORT.    AT the request of the Secretary of State for India, the Cabinet, at a meetingheld on the 23rd November, 1927 (Cabinet 57 (27), Conclusion 14), agreed to recom-mend to the Prime Minister  that a Sub-Committee of the  Committee of ImperialDefence should be set up to examine and report on the proposals recently  receivedfrom the Government of India relating to the Indianisation of the Indian Army.    2.  Accordingly our Sub-Committee was set up,, composed as follows :         The Rt. Hon.  The Earl of Balfour,  K.G., O.M.,  Lord President of the             Council (Chairman).        The Rt. Hon. W. S. Churchill, OH., M.P., Chancellor of the Exchequer.        The Rt. Hon. Sir  John Gilmour, Bt., D.S.O., M.P., Secretary of State for             Scotland (representing the Secretary of State for War).        The Rt. Hon. the Earl  of Birkenhead, Secretary of  State for India.        The Rt.  Hon. Sir Samuel Hoare, Bt., G.B.E., C.M.G., M.P., Secretary of             State for Air.        The Rt. Hon. Viscount Peel, G.B.E., First Commissioner of Works.    3.  Field-Marshal Sir Claud  Jacob,  Secretary, Military Department,  IndiaOffice, General Sir George Milne, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and Air Vice-Marshal Sir Philip Game,  Air Member for Personnel, were invited to take part inour deliberations.  In addition, the Secretary of State for India laid before us theviews of his Council.    4.  In order that the proposals of the Government of India, and our conclusions in regard  to them, may be the more readily understood, we set out in the following paragraphs a brief historical summary.    5.  Prior to 1918 Indians were not eligible  to hold the King&apos;s  Commission inHis Majesty&apos;s Land Forces.  In that year, however, in recognition of the part takenby Indians in the Great  War, this commission was, for the first time, declared opento them.    6.   The following passage in the Montagu-Chelmsford Report on constitutional reforms, which was published in 1918, is relevant:         &quot; There remains one item, the importance of which,  in the eyes of India,    outweighs all others.   British commissions have for the first time been  granted    to Indian officers.....The services of the Indian army in the war and the    great  increase in its  size  make it  necessary that a considerable  number  of    commissions should now be given.&quot;    7.   With a view to providing Indian candidates with  the necessary militarytraining, a cadet  school,* with accommodation for 50 cadets, was  established at   * This school was only an expedient to  meet the special  needs of ihe  war, aud it was closed afterone year&apos;B existence.

 Indore, iii India; .^nd, in addition, ten vacancies a year were allotted to Indians at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.    But no definite  policy was formulated at that  time  as  to the ultimate employment  of  Indians  who graduated  at these establishments.     8.   In 1921 the Legislative Assembly adopted the following resolutions: *     (a.)  &quot; That the King Emperors Indian subjects should be freely admitted to all             arms of His Majesty&apos;s military, naval and air forces in India and  the             ancillary services and the auxiliary  forces; that every encouragement             should be given to Indians including the educated middle  classes              subject to tne prescribed standards of htness.  to enter the commissioned             ranks of the Army.....&quot;     (b.)    That  not less than 25 per cent, of the King\s commissions granted even-             year should be given to His Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects to start with.&quot;     9.   In 1921 and  1922 the Government of India submitted various reconmienda- tions for extending Indianisation  in the Army.   These were examined by a Sub- Committee  of  the Committee of  Imperial Defence, whose Report! on the whole question of Indian Military requirements was approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government in January  1923.  For convenience of  reference, that portion of  the Report which deals with Indianisation is reproduced as Appendix A.    10.   Special attention  is invited  to the conclusion  contained in  paragraph 130 (a) :-         &quot; 130 (a.) A start should be made at once so as to give Indians a fair    opportunity of proving that units officered by Indians will be efficient in every    way.  Accordingly, eight units of Cavalry or Infantry should be selected, to be    officered by Indians,  as now suggested by the Government of India.&quot;    11.   The scheme contemplated in the above conclusion to which we shall here- after refer as &quot; the eight-unit Scheme &quot; was described! in the Legislative Assembly by the late Lord Rawlinson in the  following words:          &quot; The Government consider that a start should be  made at once so as to give    Indians a  fair opportunity of proving that units officered by Indians will be    efficient in  every way.   Accordingly it has  been decided that eight  units    of cavalry or infantry be selected to  be officered by Indians.   This scheme will    be put into force  immediately.  The eight units to be  wholly Indianised will be    mainly infantry units,  but there will be a proportion  of  cavalry. They will be    chosen  judiciously so as to include as many representative types as possible of    Indian battalions and cavalry regiments of the Indian Army.   Indian Officers    holding commissions in  the  Indian  Army will be  gradually transferred  to    Indianising units so  as to fill up the appointments for which they are  qualified    by their rank and by their length of service,.and the process of Indianising these    units will then continue uninterruptedly as the officers gain seniority and fitness    in other respects,  which will qualify them for the senior posts.....There is    one other point, however, which it is necessary for me to explain.  It is that,    simultaneously with the Indianisation of these selected eight units, Indians who    qualify for the King&apos;s Commission will continue, as at present, to be posted to    the other units of the Indian Army.  The number of Indian cadets now sent to    Sandhurst each year, if all pass out successfully, is more than sufficient to replace    the normal wastage in the eight units alone.&quot;    12.   The scheme  was put into operation forthwith.  It is to  be noted that it made no difference to  the pace at which the number of officers receiving the King&apos;commission  was increased;  there was no advance upon the ten vacancies originally allotted at  Sandhurst; and  Indians were still  ineligible to be employed as King&apos;s Commissioned  Officers in the artillery or engineers of the Indian Army, or in theair force.* Resolution 7 of March 28, 1921.           f      Paper No. 180-1).                 f.&apos;Ou the 17th&apos;.&apos;February, 192S.
     13.  In July* 1924, the Government of India made recommendations for      (a) the admission of  Indians to the Royal Air Force and to  Indian units of            artillery and engineers;  and     (b) an increase from ten to sixteen in the number of vacancies at Sandhurst. But before a reply had been sent to these recommendations, the Secretary of State received the proposal of the Government of India to appoint the Committee, which was eventually known as the Indian Sandhurst Committee.   The  correspondence relating to the appointment of this Committee  is attached as Appendix (B).     14.  The  Report!  of  the  Indian  Sandhurst Committee  was  published  in November 1926.  The Government of India, after consultation  with the  Secretary of State, prefaced this Report with a  foreword, in which they indicated that it might be necessary to  explore  other lines of increasing Indianisation than those which had hitherto been followed.  They also stated that the Report would be used &quot;as a starting point for discussion  with His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;     15.   With the Indian Sandhurst Report itself, it is unnecessary for us to deal, since the Government of India have not accepted its main recommendations which they describej  as &quot;insufficiently considered and in consequence  ill-founded.&quot; But, acting on the statements published in their foreword, they  have now submitted the proposals which form the subject of our enquiry.  These are set  out in full in their telegram of the 18th July, as supplemented by  their despatch of the 13th  October. The relevant correspondence is attached as Appendix (C).     16.   Before proceeding  to discuss their proposals in detail  we desire to draw attention to certain fundamental aspects of the situation.  In the first place, it is necessary to recognise that, whatever the arguments against the Indianisation of the Army and they are manifold and powerful we are deeply, in  fact, inextricably, committed to this policy by our decision in 1923,  at all events, to the extent of giving Indians &quot;a  fair opportunity of proving that  units officered  by Indians will be efficient in every way.&apos;&apos;  The  experiment is still under trial in the eight units; and it cannot be said that it has failed, and must be abandoned.    17.  In the second place, there are definite grounds against leaving matters where they now stand.  The Indian Sandhurst  Committee was appointed  with the concurrence of the Secretary of State; their Report has been published and discussed with the full knowledge that it involves reopening  the  question of Indianisation; and the foreword of the Government of  India contains a clear promise, which has since been endorsed by the secretar&apos; of State in the House of Lords, that the Report will be used as a starting point for discussions with His Majesty&apos;s Government.    18.  Moreover,  apart  from political considerations, we have learned that we are within measurable  distance of the time when the output of Indian cadets from Sandhurst will exceed the requirements of the eight units, as at present organised. At no  distant date, therefore, we must either  cease gradually or wholly to send Indians to Sandhurst (which would have a disastrous effect on Indian opinion), or distribute the cadets over the rest of the Indian Army (which would have a disastrous effect on British recruitment, and possibly on efficiency).    19.  We regard the latter contingency as particularly  objectionable, since we have been told that there is already an alarming and growing shortage of British candidates of the right stamp for  commissions  in  the Indian Army.   There are many explanations for  this shortage, but the most important of these is, we under- stand, the reluctance of parents to send their sons  to serve under Indians, or live their lives with Indians as messmates.    20.   Something, therefore, must be done; and the view put before us by the Secretary of State for India,  after full examination in his Department, is that the Government of India &quot;have  succeeded, on the whole, in dealing comprehensively, and on lines of safety, with a situation which, owing to the necessities of the case,has hitherto been treated partially, and which will inevitably present us not only           * Despatch dated 24th July, 1924.           t 0.1.D, Paper No. 155-U                       X Telegram No. 1-173 S of  18th July, 1U27.

with immediate embarrassments, but even with some positive elements of danger,unless its anomalies can be corrected.&quot;   With that view we agree.    21.  Turning now to the details of the recommendations put forward by theGovernment of India, these may be summarised as follows :     (1.)  The ultimate goal of Indianisation  should be in the creation of a self-           contained Dominion Army, in which the Commissioned officer will hold a           King&apos;s (India) commission, and Units will be organised on the model  of           British Battalions with homogeneous officer establishments, instead of two           distinct types  of commissions.&quot;     (2.) The issue of King&apos;s Commissions to Indians trained at Sandhurst should           be continued for the present.     (3.) The &quot; Eight Units &quot; system should be maintained, and the number should           hereafter be expanded as may be necessary.     (4.) Indians who enter Sandhurst in future should be posted to Indianising           units (a) in vacancies of British Officers until such vacancies are no longer           available; (b) thereafter, in place of Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers.     (5.) The  vacancies  for  direct  commissions  through  Sandhurst  should   be           increased to 20 per annum, and five further vacancies should be given           annually to Viceroy*s commissioned officers who pass through Sandhurst.     (6.) Eight annual vacancies  at Woolwich should be given to  Indians.  Those           who pass out from Woolwich should receive King&apos;s Commissions, as now-           granted to Indians passing out from Sandhurst.     (7.) Two  annual  vacancies at Cranwell should be given to Indians.   The form           of commission  to be given to Indians who pass out  from Cranwell should           be reserved for further consideration.     (8.) The question of the establishment of an Indian Military College should  be           postponed  until Sandhurst  is no  longer capable  of absorbing Indian           Cadets in the numbers forthcoming.     (9.) An overseas  element should be created in the existing pay of Indian Army           officers, and Indians entering Sandhurst under the new system should  be           ineligible for this element.    (10.) Scholarships should be instituted  to  enable Indian boys to  meet the           expenses of education at Sandhurst, Woolwich or Cranwell.    (11.) The official guardian at Sandhurst should be a serving officer.    (12.) Any  deficiency in the forces available for the defence of India due to lesser           efficiency of completely Indianised units should be made good either by           additional  British troops or by  additional Indian troops with British           officers.    We  will  discuss these  above proposals seriatim.    22.  Recommendation No. 1. The first step should be the organisation of the           units selected for Indianisation on the model of British battalions, with           homogeneous  officer establishments, instead  of txvo distinct types  of           Commissions.   the  Commissioned Officers in these  units should hold- a           King&apos;s (India) Commission.    It should be remembered that the system on which the Indian Army is at presentorganised is  a  hybrid,  as  is inevitable when native troops are commanded by  alienofficers, and for linguistic and other reasons the contact between the junior officersand the rank and file cannot be nearly so close as that between the British subalternand his men  in a British  Unit.  The gap in the Indian Army is filled by a class  ofmen known as Viceroy&apos;s  commissioned officers,  Avho act  as intermediates betweenthe ICing&apos;s commissioned  officers and the rank  and  file.    These  are selected  bypromotion  from the ranks, and hold a position above that of a Warrant Officer in aBritish regiment, but below that of the King&apos;s commissioned officer.  In proportion as Indians  take the place of British in the King&apos;s commissioned ranks of a section  ofthe Indian Army,  the necessity for maintaining  this intermediate class of officerdisappears.  If the  nucleus  of an  Indian   National  Army  is ever to   be developed,  it is essential  that the junior officers should maintain  the same kind  of close contact  with their men as is expected of a British subaltern in a British  unit.The proposal of the Government of India to eliminate the Viceroy&apos;s Commissionedofficer  from Indianising  units therefore appears  logical.    It has the  additionaladvantage  that it  widens  the  scope of Indianisntion without  necessitating  an
increase in the eight units, at any rate, for some time to come.  In these circumstances we see no objection to an announcement that the Governments policy of Indianisationis directed towards the development of a self-contained Dominion Army, officered by indians, provided that it is definitely required that the process is strictly contingent on the success achieved in the various stages of the experiment.  We also agree thatthe Units in which the experiment of Indianising is to be tried, should be organised onthe model of British Battalions with homogeneous  officer establishments, instead oftwo distinct types of commissions.    23.   Recommendation  So. 2. The issue  of King&apos;s Commissions to Indians          trained at Sandhurst should be continued for the  present.    At present Indians passing out of Sandhurst are given exactly the same form of commission as other cadets, namely, the King&apos;s Commission  in His Majesty&apos;s land forces, which carries  power of command over  all personnel,  whether British orIndian, in those Forces. The conunissions  granted to Dominion officers,  on the otherhand, carry power of command  only in the Dominion Forces.  We agree  with theGovernment of India that, under their present proposals, India ought  to be put onthe same footing  in this  respect as the Dominions. We consider,  however,  that itwould be proper to make the change now. when the number of Indians already holdingthe full King&apos;s Commission is still small.  Consideration of the new form of commis-sion  will  involve  a large  number of technical points;   and we, therefore, suggestthat it should be examined by the Secretary of  State for India, in consultation withthe Secretaries of State for War and Air, and that their recommendations shouldbe reported to the Committee of Imperial  Defence.    24.   Recommendation No. 3. The eight-units system should be maintained, and          the number should hereafter be expanded as necessary.    We  fully agree indeed we consider it essential that the general principle underlying the &quot;eight-units system &quot; should be  maintained, since  we should neverrecommend assent to any measure which  involved experimenting with the  indian army as a whole.  In our view this principle affords  the only practical means ofisolating the experiment, and thus of arriving  in course of time at  an  accurate estimate  of  its results.  And it has  the added  advantage that it will secure theposition of British Officers entering the Indian Army.  It may thus  serve to cure thealarming shortage of British  candidates of the right type, to which we have already referred in paragraph 19.    25.&quot;  Recommendation No. 4. Indians who  enter Sandhurst  in future should          be posted to Indianising units (a)  in vacancies  of British officers  until          such vacancies are no  longer available;   (b)  thereafter  in  place of           Viceroy&apos;s Commissioned officers.    This  recommendation is a natural corollary to our previous recommendations,and we agree with it in principle. We consider that the details can best  be settled bythe Secretary of State for India in consultation with the Government of India.    26.   Recommendation No. 5. The vacancies  for  direct commissions  through          Sandhurst  should  be increased to 20 per  annum; and  five further          vacancies slwuld be given to Viceroy&apos;s Commissioned officers who pass          through Sandhurst.    We have been informed that Sandhurst could absorb Indians up to a maximumef 25 per annum without serious risk of  prejudicing its essential characteristics;and that the Army Council would be prepared  to accept up to that number.  Atthe same time, the Chief of  the Imperial General Staff told us that Sandhurst isalready carrying a residuum of cadets, which tends to lower the standard of the Collegeas a whole, and that methods &quot;of raising the educational standard of British entrantsare being seriously considered.  We are impressed by the force  of these arguments;and we consider it essential that Indian candidates should be required to pass thesame  standard of admission as British candidates, and should  not, as  hitherto, beadmitted on  a  separate and  lower standard.  We hold equally strongly  that theBritish standard of proficiency at Sandhurst should be insisted on for Indians;  and,in any event, it must be  clearly  understood that the Army Council have the right
                                      uwith Indian, as with British, cadets to remove without question any cadet who isconsidered unfitted to become an officer.   In that connection, we desire to draw attention to the disastrous effect that would be created, if an unduly large proportionof Indians admitted to Sandhurst were removed  for inefficiency.   We suggest thatthe necessity of obviating this risk by the maintenance of a  proper standard of selection, should be impressed on  the Government of India.     27.  Recommendation No,  6. Eight  annual vacancies at  Woolwich should be           given  to Indians.  Those who  pass out from  Woolwich should receive           Kiiufs Commissions,  as  now  granted to Indians passing out from           Sandhurst.     In principle there is no objection to the admission of a limited number of indians to Woolwich, and we understand that the Army Council would be prepared to acceptup to six, provided that the British standard  of admission to, and proficiency at,Woolwich, is rigidly insisted on.   In practice, however, we consider it indispensiblethat a satisfactory scheme for the eventual employment of Indians who have passedout successfully,  should be  settled in advance.   The Government of  India havesuggested that Indian officers who have so passed out should be absorbed into IndianMountain Batteries and Sapper and Miner Companies (which are integral parts ofthe  Indian Army),  and  that  certain  of  these  Units should be  earmarked  forIndianisation, as has been done  in  the case of the Cavalry  and Infantry.  Thissuggestion  appears to us to rely too much upon the belief that Indians will  not succeed in passing out of Woolwich at anything like the rate of six  a year.  Howeverwell founded this belief may be, it appears essential that the position should  be safeguarded, and that we  should,  in no  circumstances,  be confronted with  thenecessity of posting Indians  to British Units.  The Government of India&apos;s proposal,as it stands, does not contain the necessary safeguard.  In our opinion, this couldbe supplied by requiring that, if and when the number of promising candidates forWoolwich should  be found to exceed present expectations, the number of admissionsshould be regulated strictly in proportion to the rate at which Indian officers can besafely absorbed into Indian Mountain Batteries, and Sapper and Miner Companies.We  recommend  that  the Government of  India  should be asked to  submit their estimate  of the rate at which Indianisation can safely be allowed to proceed in thoseUnits, and that the number of vacancies at Woolwich should be  limited accordingly,as occasion may require.    Indian Mountain Batteries are at present commanded by British Service officers,who are not in the same position as Indian Army officers, and could not be ordered to serve in a Battery that had been earmarked for Indianisation.  It would appearnecessar3r, therefore, that the Government  of India should ask  for volunteers fromthe British Service, on terms to be arranged, to  maintain the officer establishment ofsuch Batteries.    We see no objection to an accouncement that Indians will be regarded as eligiblefor admission to Woolwich up to a maximum of six a year, on  the same conditionsas British candidates, provided that details can be worked out  for their absorptionin Indian  Service Artillery and Engineer units.  It should  be  understood thatIndians will not receive preferential treatment as  regards posting  to the  latter, andthat an Indian will only be regarded as eligible for appointment to a Sapper andMiner company if his place on the passing-out list would have qualified him for theRoyal Engineers had he been a British cadet.    As regards the form of commission to be granted to  Indians who pass out of woolwich,  our recommendation in paragraph 23 is applicable.    28.  Recommendation No.  7. Two  annual vacancies at Cranwell should  be           given to Indians.  The form of commission to Indians who pass out from           Cramcell should  be reserved, for further consideration.    We consider that there is no  objection  in principle to the admission  of indians to Cranwell, and we have been told that the Air Council would accept them providedthat the  British standard of admission&quot; and proficiency is insisted on.   But here again it must first be settled how  successful cadets are to be.employed; and in this instance  the special difficulty arises, that there  are  no Indian  Air Force Unitscorresponding in any way with the Cavalry, Artillery, Engineer  and Infantry Unitsof the Indian Army.  The Government of India proposed to overcome this difficulty
 by the adoption of the scheme drawn up by the Air Officer Commanding in India, which is described in  the enclosure to their Despatch.  We found ourselves unable to agree to this scheme, since it contemplates the maintenance for some 14 years of mixed Air Units, in which British officers and other ranks would, at one stage or another, have to serve under Indian  officers.   At our request the Secretary of State  for  India  asked the Government of India by  telegraph to amplify their proposals in such  a way as to guarantee suitable employment to Indians who pass out of Cranwell, without the  necessity of posting them for an indefinite period to British Service Units, an arrangement which the  Government of  India themselves recognise as impossible.  The Viceroy,  in his reply, has suggested an  alternative scheme,  the essence of which is the recognition of the necessity of gradually creating an entirely Indian  Air Organisation for the reception of any  Indian officers who succeed  in passing out of Cranwell.     We are unable, in the  short time at our disposal,  to commit ourselves in any way with regard to this particular scheme,  but we are satisfied  that the ground of our objections to the original proposal has been realised in India, and that  it is not impossible to devise ways and means of meeting them.   At this stage, therefore, we record our view that we see no objection, on principle, to the admission of Indians to Cranwell, on the conditions we have stated.   The matter should, in our  opinion, be further explored by the  Secretary of State for  India, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Air and the Government of India.     We are informed  that, on the conditions stated,  the  Air Council would  be prepared,   in  due  course,  to   accept  Indian  cadets  at  Cranwell.   Until, however,  a  definite   scheme  can  be  worked   out  on  the  lines  we  have advocated, we  consider it would be premature to come to  any decision as to the number of Indians to  be admitted annually to Cranwell; and we recommend that any announcement on the subject should  be confined to a statement of the principle that Indians will  be regarded as eligible for admission as soon as a satisfactory scheme for their subsequent employment  in an Indian air unit has been  completed.    29.  Recommendation No. 8. The question of the  establishment of an Indian           Military College should be  postponed until Sandhurst  is  no longer           capable of absorbing Indian cadets in the numbers forthcoming.     Considerable difficulty has been experienced in filling even the limited number of vacancies at present offered at Sandhurst.  Up to date, out of 243 candidates who have presented themselves for these vacancies, 97  have been admitted; 25  of these  are  still in  residence, but  of  the remaining 72,  only  51  have been commissioned.   In view of  India&apos;s inability to fill satisfactorily even the  limited number of vacancies at present offered,  wre agree  that  no good purpose would  be served in existing circumstances by the establishment of an Indian Military College.    30.  Recommendation  No. 9. An overseas element should be created in  the.           existing pay of the Indian Army, and Indians entering Sandhurst under           the new system should be ineligible for this element.    We understand that the principle of differential rates of pay has already been largely acted upon in the Civil Services in India.  The proposal to apply it to the Army, therefore, appears reasonable and  proper.    31.  Recommendation No. 10.--Scholarships  should be instituted  to  enable           Indian  boys to meet the  expenses of education at Sandhurst,  Woolwich           and Cranwell.    Field-Marshal  Sir  Claud Jacob told us that  when he was President  of the Selection Board in India, out  of an average of 25  candidates who presented them- selves each year for commissions,  he had had great difficulty in passing five as suitable.  He also told  us that the cost of educating an Indian youth at Sandhurst was  remarkably high,  and  that  the  Government  of  India  would have  to  pay practically  the whole of these expenses if they wished to attract the best class of fighting man.  We are impressed by this evidence; and we are, therefore, in full agreement with the proposal to institute scholarships as  a means of improving boththe quality and the quantity of candidates.   Nothing, which might widen the field of suitable candidates should be left undone.
     32.  Recommendation. No.  11. The official guardian at Sandhurst should be a            serving officer.     We  consider  that  the question of the position of the official  guardian at Sandhurst  should  be settled by  the  Secretary of State  in consultation with the Government of India.     33.  Recommendation No. 12. Any deficiency  in the  forces available for the            defence of India due  to lesser efficiency of completely Indianised units            should be made good either by additional British troops or by additional            Indian troops with British officers.     We are in full agreement with this  proposal, which is  a necessary corollary to the experiment of Indianisation.     34.  In conclusion, we do not wish either the  Cabinet or the Committee of Imperial Defence to be under any illusion as to the effect of the policy under discussion on the efficiency  of the Indian  Army.   Our expert military advisers made it clear to us  that,  in their opinion, it  would not be safe,  at  any rate unless and until the experiment  proved  successful,  to rely either in  actual warfare  or even for the maintenance of law and order, on units in which the British element  is within sight of disappearing.   Consequently, a portion of the Indian Forces is being deliberately exposed to  the risk  of a  progressive deterioration  in  the  standard of efficiency, without any corresponding economy, at  a moment when disarmament and economy are the order of the day, and when as revealed by  the  enquiries  of the Sub- Committee  of the Committee of  Imperial Defence on the  Defence  of India the military resources of India require considerable readjustment to enable them to fulfil the possible defensive needs of the country.  But we are inextricably committed, and on grounds of policy  and expediency we cannot  leave matters where they now stand.  In  these circumstances, we consider that the  proposals of the Government of India are probably the  most innocuous that can be devised.  We  do not for one moment believe that, by adopting them, we shall satisfy Indian aspirations.  But we shall be keeping the ground fully occupied, and  we  shall be able to reply with truth for many years to come that we are doing our best to meet Indian susceptibilities.     35.                 SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.     (1.) We see  no objection to an announcement that the Governments policy of Indianisation is  directed towards the development of a Dominion Army officered by Indians, provided that it is definitely required that the process is strictly contingent on the success achieved in the various stages of the experiment. The Units in which the experiment of Indianising  is to be tried, should be organised on the model of British Battalions with homogeneous officer establishment, instead of  two distinct types  of commissions (paragraph 22).     (2.)  The form of commission to be granted in future to Indian  Officers should be analogous in respect of  power of command to that granted to officers in the self- governing Dominions.  The details should be further examined by the Secretaries of State  for War, Air and India, whose recommendations should be reported to the Committee of Imperial Defence  (paragraph 23).     (3.)  It is essential that the  principle  underlying  the &apos;&apos; eight-units system&quot; should be maintained (paragraph 24).     (4.) Indians who enter Sandhurst in future should be posted to Indianising units (a) in  place of British Officers until such vacancies are no longer available; and (6) thereafter, in  place of Viceroys as commissioned  officers (paragraph 25).     (5.) We see  no objection to an announcement that vacancies at Sandhurst will be made available to  Indians up to a maximum  of 25 per annum, provided that the British standard of proficiency is insisted on  for Indians at all three stages, viz., for passing into Sandhurst, for retention at the College, and  for passing out.  The necessity of maintaining a proper standard of selection should be impressed on the. Government of India (paragraph 26).     (6.) We see no objection in principle to the admission of Indians to Woolwichup to a maximum of 6 a year, provided that the principle  underlying the &quot; 8-units
scheme &quot; is also applied to the Indian Service Units to which they will eventually be posted; and that the actual number of admissions to Woolwich is in no case allowedto exceed the number which at any given time can be safely absorbed into those Units.The British standard should be insisted on in exactly the same way as for Sandhurst(paragraph 27).    (7.) We see no objection in principle to declaring Indians eligible for admissionbe Cranwell, provided that a suitable scheme can be devised for their eventual employ-ment otherwise than  in  British Service Air Units.   Pending this  we think itpremature to  record any  conclusion as to  the number of vacancies to be reservedannually.  Here  again,  the  British  standard  must  be  applied   throughout(paragraph 28).    (8.) No good purpose would be served in existing circumstances by the establish-ment of an Indian Military College (paragraph 29).    (9.) The principle of creating an  overseas element in the existing pay of  theIndian Army, on the precedent already existing in the Indian civil services,  is ingeneral accordance with the remainder of our conclusions (paragraph 30).    (10.) The  success of the scheme would be furthered by the institution of scholar-ships to enable Indian boys to meet the expenses of education at Sandhurst, woolwich and Cranwell.  Nothing which might widen the field of suitable candidates, shouldbe left undone (paragraph 31).                    -     (11.)  The question of the position of the ^hcoro&apos; guardian at Sandhurst shouldbe settled by the Secretary of State for India in consultation with the Government ofIndia (paragraph 32).    (12.)  Any deficiency in the forces available for the defence of India due to lesserefficiency of completely Indianised Units should be  made good either by additionalBritish troops or by additional Indian troops and British officers.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,BALFOUR.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.

APPENDIX  (A).     EXTKACT FROM THE REPORT OF THE SUB-CoMMITTEE ON  INDIAN MILITARY                    REQUIREMENTS [C.I.D. PAPER NO. 130 D].          ******                      (21) Indianisation of the Indian Army.    117.  On  the  2Sth  March  192 L the  Indian  Legislative  Assembly  passed  the following resolutions :      &quot; (a) That the king-Emperor&apos;s Indian subjects should be freely admitted to all         arms  of  His  Majesty&apos;s Military, Naval  and Air  Forces iu  India, and  the         Ancillary Services and the Auxiliary Forces.   That every encouragement         should be given  to Indians,  including the educated  middle-classes, subject         to the prescribed standard of  fitness, to enter the commissioned ranks of the         Army  .     &quot; (6) That not  less than 25 per cent, of the King&apos;s commissions granted every         year should be given to His Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects to start with.&quot;    These resolutions were accepted by the Government of India.    11S.  In para. 40 of their Report, Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee recommended that the Indianisation of the Indian Army should proceed by the following method :      &quot;(a) A gradual and prudent reduction of British units in the Army in India.     &quot; (6) The gradual Indianisation of the  commissioned and other appointments         now held in  the  Indian  Army by British personnel, and  the rendering of         India more and more self-supporting as regards all arms and services.&quot;    119.  Section (24) of this Report deals with (a).  As regards (b), Lord Rawliuson&apos;s Committee recommended that 26 percent, of the vacancies for Indian Army cadetships at Sandhurst should immediately be  thrown open to  Indian  youths, and  that that percentage should be increased by 2\ per cent, annually, so that  in 10 years&apos; time the proportion of British  and  Indians  entering the  commissioned ranks of the Indian Army would  be equal.  That Committee further recommended that  commissions in the Ancillary Services  with separate Indian cadres, such as the Supply and Transport Corps and the Indian Ordnance Department, should be thrown open to Indians, and also that Indians  should be admitted  to commissioned rank in the Indian Artillery and Indian Sappers and Miners.    120.  The Government of India made no specific recommendation in regard to this portion of the Report of Lord Rawlinsou&apos;s Committee.    121.  In their Despatch No. 74 of September 1921 the Government of  India have asked that:      (1) a limited number of suitable India U lads  mav be sent home  for training in         the  Royal Air Force, with  a view to their obtaining commissions  as officers         in the Royal Air Force for service in India;     (2) a limited number of suitable Indian candidates should be admitted  each year         into Woolwich with a view to their obtaining  commissions in  such  units         as the Indian Pack Artillery, the Sappers and Miners aud Military Works         Services;     (3) the number of  cadetships at Sandhurst annually for Indians should  be         increased from 10 to 12 or 13, this latter number being 25 per cent, of the         number of commissions granted at present annually to the Indian Army.    122. We have also had before us a scheme for  Indianisation. the essential feature of which was that  a Dominion  Force should gradually be formed  in India.  It was proposed that that Force should be initiated by the formatiou of one complete militaryunit, such as a brigade of all arms,  with ancillary services outside the establishmentof the Indian Army.  It was proposed  that further units  should he raised as soon asthe success of the experiment was assured, and  that  the  strength  of the ImperialArmy should be reduced pari passu  with the increase of the Dominion  Army.      [IG921]                                                           a
    The scheme provided for the officering of the whole Dominion Force by  Indians holding Dominion commissions, but a few British officers were to be allotted  to units of the Dominion Force on formation for the purposes of organisation and training.    123. The Secretary of State for  India  referred that scheme to the Government of ludia for their observations.  The Government of India  rejected the scheme on  the grounds that  it  would establish  a formation  surplus  to the  minimum  military requirements of India which the country could  not  afford, ami that it would  be unlit for service in the field.   They further  expressed the opinion  that Indian sentiment would not accept such a scheme as an earnest of our intention to Indianise the Army.    124. The Government of ludia accordingly submitted another scheme, dated  the 11th  January  1022,  prepared by a Committee  of  military officers  in  India, which provided for  the complete  ludianisation of the  Indian Army (excluding Gurkhas) in three stages of 14 years each commencing  from 1025, with the proviso that the second and third periods  might  bo curtailed if  the first period proved successful.  The main feature of the  scheme was the complete lndianisation of one-third of&quot;  the units of  the Indian  Army in each period by posting Indian officers at  the  rate of two a year to each  infantiy,  pioneer and cavalry regiment in displacement of one  British and one Viceroy&apos;s commissioned Indian officer.   These Indian officers, who would hold King&apos;s Commissions in  His Majesty&apos;s  Indian  Land  Forces, were  to be obtained both from those Indian officers  now holding Viceroy&apos;s commissions aud from cadets from a new military college to bo opened in India on the lines of Sandhurst.    125. Under the  scheme the annual entry of Indian officers would be  about 110 duriug the  first 14 years&apos; period, and 250 during the second period ; while the total number of officers ultimately required would  be (1,804.    No  evidence has been  laid  before us to lead us to believe  anything  approaching that  number of suitable candidates will be forthcoming.   Under the  system initiated during  the war of granting King&apos;s  Commissions  to Indian  cadets the supply of candidates  is  not sufficient to fill the small number of vacancies 10 per annum  reserved for  them.  Nor  have  the selected  Indian candidates shown themselves capable of  attaining  the  educational  and other standards  required  from  British cadets,   over whom they  are  given preferential treatment, by being  admitted  to Sandhurst on passing a simpler examination.    126. The  security of India from dangers without and  within depends  ultimately upon the efficiency aud lo\-alty of the Indian Army.  In  the past the Indian Army has proved itself  to  be  a highly efficient  and trustworthy instrument  for war.   Its&quot;splendid record is mainly clue to the ability and devotion to ditty of its British officers, and to their extraordinary capacity for gaining the respect and affection of their  men. We believe that the continued loyalty and efficiency of the Indian Army are,  for the present, dependent upon the maintenance of the present proportion of British officers. This  view  appears to  be shared by the Viceroy, who, in a telegram, No. 22, dated the 7th January 1922, stated that, so long as the present proportion of British officers and the existing composition of regiments  are retained, he had every confidence in the loyalty  of the Indian Army.    127. The scheme for Indiauisation  put forward  by the Uovernmeut of  ludia, and referred  to in para. 124,  is irreconcilable with that view.    It aims  at the  total elimination of  British officers from  the Indian Army.  We are unable to understand how  the Government of India&apos;and  their  military advisers have been able to satisfy themselves that so revolutionary a change can prudently be iutroduced at the present time.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government cannot take such  a risk, nor does  it appear that it can  ever be  prudent to announce  a  programme requiring, even in the eyes of  its supporters, 30 or 40 years for its execution.  Much might  happen iu so long a period to negative or change the conclusions so announced.    12S. Nor is the present moment well  chosen for  tho announcement of so  great a -change.  India is passing through a difficult period of transition.  Public opinion is restless, and the measure of support upon  which Government can count is doubtful. At such a time when the authority of Government is  widely challenged, and sedition is openly preached, special  caution is necessary in all  that relates to the armed forces which are the  ultimate basis of the authority of the King-Emperor&apos;s Government, and of the safety of life and maintenance of order.
   129. The Indian claim has beeu that, as promised in Queen Victoria&apos;s Proclamation,there should be no racial discrimination against Indians.   To this claim full assent isgiven; but  that promise did not mean, and must  not be interpreted to mean, thatIndiaus are  to be selected without regard  to their fitness for the posts which they are called  upon to fill.  Until the capacity of  India  to  supply a  sufficient number of trained and suitable  candidates has been approved, it  would  be  extremely rash to embark on any large experiment or to pledge the future.Conclusions.   130. (a) A start should be made at once so as to give  Indians a fair opportunityof proving that units officered by Indians will be efficient in everyway.   Accordingly,eight units of Cavalry or Infantry should be selected, to be officered  by Indians as now  suggested by the Government of India.   (b)  The  proposal of the government of India  that a  military college should beestablished in India for the training of Indian cadets destined for service in the indian army,  in view of the admittedly unsatisfactory results of the experiment of admittingIndian cadets to the Royal Military College,  Sandhurst, without previous  training,is concurred in.

Undertaking given by sir alexander Muddiman on 14th March, vide page 2402 of Assembly debates.   2. After discussion in Council  on 7th April last, we decided that a Committee,including Indian members of the Legislature, should be appointed to investigate andreport:   (a) by  what means  it is  possible  to improve upon  the  present supplyof Indian  candidates for the King&apos;s Commission,  both in regard to  number and quality ;  (b) whether it is not desirable and practicable to establish a military collegein India to train Indian officers for the commissioned ranks of the Indian Army;(c) if the answer to (b) is  in the affirmative, howr soon should the scheme bo initiatedand what steps should be  taken to  cany it out ? (d) whether, if a military college is established  in India, it should supersede or be supplemented by Sandhurst andWoolwich as far as the training of Indian officers is concerned.   3. We have decided to appoint Committee because, as stated in our telegram of24th January, we see certain advantage to be gained in having implications  of an indian Sandhurst  carefully and exhaustively explored.  We think enquiries of theCommittee, if  properly directed,  should have valuable educative  effect on Indian -public opinion, and we are also of opinion, that full investigation  of the important question of military  education and training  of Indians  is  necessary  in  order  toprovide us  with material which will be indispensable in considering  any further  phase of Army Indianisation.  Further, we have been informed on previous occasions thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were willing to consider any proposal we  might make fortraining Indian officers in India rather than at Sandhurst.  References to this subje &apos;twill  be  found in your  telegrams  (575,  dated  14th February 1922, 807, dated  22ndFebruary 1922, and also in your telegram 82S, dated 5th April 1918.   4. You will observe that the terms of reference to the Committee are  not so wideas those recommended  in the resolution  adopted   by  Legislative Assembly  on1.9th  February 1925.  In  our opinion, the larger  question  of  accelerating the pace of Indianisation in the Army is not one which could properly be entrusted  to the&quot;investigation of a Committee such as we have decided to appoint.   We may explain,.-      [16921]                                                         a 2

We  havenow completed  our deliberations on  main aspects of  Report.  Following  are our provisional conclusions.ill this connection, that the scope of the first term of reference laid down is merelyascertainment of the means by which we can obtain competitors of better quality andin larger numbers for existing vacancies.    5. We  have now decided  upon composition ol the  proposed Committee.   It willbe presided  over by  Lieut.-Geueral  Sir A. Skeen, Chief of the  General Staff.   Itwill include the Army secretar&apos; and, iu addition to the members  of  the Legislature,two representatives of  the yeoman  class who  make  service  in the Army  theirprofession, both these representatives having sons at Sandhurst at the present moment.    6. As regards the procedure, we think  it. very desirable that at an  early stage ofthe enquiry the Committee should  be invited to select three or four of  its members,who should proceed to England in order to see  for themselves not only Sandhurst,Woolwich and other  technical military training colleges, but also every part of themachinery which goes  to  the making of a British Army officer that is to say, theyshould  visit  certain  selected preparatory  schools and  public  schools.   Perhaps itmight be advantageous for deputation  to visit some  military training institutionson the  Continent also.  Deputation  would be  accompanied by a carefully  selectedmilitary officer.   Matter is of so  much importance that we haAre thought it advisable to  acquaint  you  fully with what  we propose to do.   In particular, we  wish  toascertain  definitely  whether  you  will  undertake  to  secure  facilities which thedeputation to  England would require.    7. Cost of  the proposed enquiry  will  be reported  to you  as soon as possible.Amount has  not yet  been  exactly  estimated.   It  will  be considerable,  but notprohibitive.    8. We  request reply by telegraph  as soon as possible.  We have not yet madeauy announcement on  the  subject,  apart from undertaking given  by Home  member in Legislative Assembly, and we are anxious to summon the preliminary meeting  ofthe Committee immediately before the  August session of the Legislative Assembly.     Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Army Department, dated 7th July 1925.    1849.  Army Department.  Your  telegram  of the  16th May, No.  305.   I have noted with interest  debate iu Legislative Assembly on 19th February and recogniseadvantage  to  be  gained as stated in your para. 3 by appointment of  Committee withwhich you have now decided to  proceed.  I agree, moreover, that  institution of suchenquiry is a  development which His Majesty&apos;s Government have already in the past been  prepared  to contemplate.  Difficulties experienced  in  successive years  inobtaining suitable recruits for Sandhurst have  rendered enquiry under  first term ofreference especially desirable, if not, indeed, inevitable ; and I agree that opportunitycan now usefully be taken to examine alternative methods of training under second term.As regards latter, please see suggestion made in my telegram dated 19th June, No. 1696.    I note your explanation of scope of first term of reference, though  it  remains to beseen how far Committee can deal effectually with second term without at the sametime approaching wider issues than  those  jou have sought  to define.  In view of this possibility aud of the bearing which in auy event Committee&apos;s findiugs must  have on existing system of recruitment of  Indian officers, I propose to defer  reply to yourconfidential  Army Department Despatch  of the  24th July 1924, No. 33, until I  canconsider it in conjunction with Committee&apos;s report and your recommendations  thereon.    I  will endeavour  to  secure  facilities as requested in  your  para.  6 and willcommunicate again.  Presumably suggested deputation will not arrive before October,when institutions will be in full working order.    I am telegraphing separately as regards announcement in reply to your telegramof the 5th .1 une, No. 348.
   2. Although Committee clearly exceeded intention of  their terms of reference bylaying down programme for progressive increase in the number of King&apos;s Commissionsfor Indians  up to  1952,  and although  their demands  appear to us insufficientlyconsidered and in consequence ill-founded, we welcome  the  opportunity afforded bythe Report of formulating definite policy in regard to Indianisation.  The  existing10 annual vacancies at Sandhurst  were  granted  during  the war, with  no clear ideahow the officers would be disposed of.  Similarly, recommendations of our predecessorsin 1921 and 1922 merely aimed at granting so  many commissions to Indians withoutany reorganisation  of  units or formations  in which  they would serve.  The  eight-units  scheme has  merits  of  clearly defining  area of experiment, but here  againorganisation is the same as that of British officered  units,  which we think  unsuitable.Committee recommend indiscriminate admission of  Indians, in annually  increasing numbers,  into all units equally with  British officers.   It  is probable that  this would affect adversely supply of British  officers for the  Indian Army, which  committee itself  considers essential to efficiency.  Moreover, it is also possible that War  office would feel that such action might even prejudice recruitment to tlie British service.We should be glad to be informed of considered views  of  His Majesty&apos;s Governmenton these points, which are obviously of the first importance.   In any case we cannotassent to incurring possible loss of efficiency entailed  by a measure which involvesexperimenting with  the Indian  Army  as a whole.   But  the salient objection tothe Connnittee&apos;s  proposal  is that it  is merely a  time-table, which depends on  anunascertained supply of entrants  of unproved  quality and seems  to contemplate no definite goal.   3.  We consider that the time has come to acknowledge and  announce publicly that the ultimate  goal of Indianisation is  the creation of a self-contained DominionArmy, in which the commissioned officer will hold  a King&apos;s (India) Commission  and units  will be organised on  the model of  British battalions with homogeneous officerestablishments instead of two distinct types of commissions.   i. We are unanimous that  announcement of the main policy should be made assoon as possible.  Some members were  disposed to  press the  view that, from thedate of the announcement of the policy, new entrants  to Sandhurst should be eligiblefor the Dominion type  of commission only, with consequential reductions of pay, andon being commissioned should replace the Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers  as platoonand troop leaders.   Others  of us, including the Commander-in-Chief,  fear that if these changes were to come into operation simultaneously from the date of the announcementof policy and before the concessional  measures suggested beknv had taken practical effect, proposals would be condemned as retrograde, candidates would be discouraged by  the  diminished prospects from offering  themselves  for  commissions, whole scheme would be prejudiced and might even be wrecked  at the outset.  It was alsostrongly urged that it would create a  difficult and  undesirable  situation betweenIndian and British cadets  serving  side by side at  Sandhurst and going  to join theIndian Army together  if both realised that, on joining the Indian Army, the formerwould receive subordinate commission.   In deference to these views we recommend that  the issue of King&apos;s commissions to Indians trained at Sandhurst should be continued until the nucleus of a Dominionforce  can  be created, on the understanding that  the  change  to a Dominion  basis isnot indefinitely postponed  and that progress in this direction will be the  subject of periodical review.   We recommend that Indians who enter Sandhurst in future shouldhe posted  to  Indianising  units either in vacancies of  British officers or in  those ofViceroy&apos;s commissioned officers as required, with a view to accelerating the conversionof the units into British or  Dominion pattern.   5.  We contemplate, therefore, that Indians  receiving King&apos;s commissions shotddin future be posted to the smallest number of units, not less than  eight, that is capableof absorbing  them, and in  practice, therefore,  it may be taken that our  proposals are a  continuance of principle of eight-units  scheme.   We  consider  that it  mustbe recognised from  the  beginning  that  completely  Indianised  units of cavalry,infantry and pioneers may prove less efficient than  British officered units,  and, if so,that when time comes the resulting  deficiency in the forces available for the  defenceof India must be made good,&apos;either by  additional British troops or by  additionalIndian troops witli British officers.   6.  In 1921 the then Government of India accepted  a  Resolution  of the assembly that no less than 25 per cent, of  King&apos;s Commissions granted  every year  should  begiven  to Indians to start  with, and  supported (sic)  the  proposal  to His Majesty&apos;s
Government.,  who, however,  were unable to approve  it.    The  Assembly was so informed in  July 1923.   The  Committee  has  expressed  strong  views againstcontinuing the restrictions to number of vacancies originally allotted in 1918 on theground that such narrow numbers afford too scanty inducement  to material to come forward.  We think there  is force in this contention, aud are also of opinion that theexisting numbers are insufficient to give initial effect to policy which we ourselves now recommended.   We should  accordingly  propose  to increase the vacancies for directcommissions through Sandhurst to 20, and to give five  commissions annually, throughSandhurst also, to Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers on the lines of commissions now-given to rankers in the British service.  Shortage,  in the 20 vacancies might be made good  by increasing  the  number of commissions granted to Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers up to a maximum of 10 in any one year.   We  would  permit no lowering of standard  in  the  entrance  examination.   Further, we  propose  that Committee&apos;recommendation of  eight  annual vacancies at  Woolwich and  two at Cranwell  beaccepted, on couditiou stipulated  by Committee that Indian boys shall  be  required topass the  same entrance test as British boys.  Indian entrants  to artillery could he attached  to mountain batteries on being commissioned, with  a  view to eventualformation of  separate Dominion  artillery units.   The question of creating Iudiauartillery,  other than  mountain batteries, must  be reserved for  later consideration.Similarly, engineer officers would serve with sapper  and miner companies, militaryengineering services  and signal  companies.  Indians  commissioned from  Crauwellwould  be attached to units of the Royal Air Force  iu ludia until such time as auIndian Air Force is instituted under scheme which has been put forward by the AirOfficei- Commanding.   We reserve for further consideration type  of commission to begranted to Indians in Indian Air Force.   7. We are unanimous  that, on grounds of  military efficiency and  economy, thequestion of the establishment of  an  India U  Military  College.should be postponed until Sandhurst is uo longer capable  of  absorbing Indian cadets in the numbersforthcoming.  We thiuk that in future as many as possible of the first officers of theDominion Army should  have received their military education with British cadets atSandhurst.   We  make no proposal for iucreasing the number of  vacancies at Sandhurst beyond25, siuce we  anticipate  that it will be  some  years before we regularly obtain  that number, and until we have had  experience of the result, of extending the numbersit would be useless to make  further  recommendations.  If the  requisite  material isfound  to be forthcoming, we  should  contemplate gradual expansion of numbers wehave given, and we  should be  glad to learn in due course  the maximum number of indians which Arni3^ and  Air Councils would  be prepared to  admit annually  toSandhurst, Woolwich and Cranwell in the future.   S. In  view of  our   inability  to  recommend  immediate  institution  of IndiauSandhurst, we realise that  many of the best  types of  candidates  may be lost to thearmy through the extra charges imposed on parents by the cost of sending their  sonsto England.   We  propose, with reference to  recommendation (24) in  Appendix 1 of report, to institute scholarships  to  enable Indian boys to  meet  the expenses  ofeducation at Sandhurst, Woolwich or Cranwell.   The maximum amount  admissiblewould  be based on the difference between this cost, and assumed  cost of education atan Indian Military College.  Subject  to this  maximum, Commander-in-Chief shouldhave full discretion to regulate the amount of  scholarships according to the pecuniarycircumstances of individual cadets.   9. As regards  pay,  we think  that  an  overseas element should be  created in existing pay of Indian Army officers,  aud that Indians  entering Sandhurst under new system should be ineligible for this element.   10.  We recommend also that the official guardian of Indians  at Sandhurst shouldbe a serving officer, who would be very  carefully selected.   11.  Resolutions on the subject of  the Committee&apos;s Report have been tabled in theAssembly and  Council  of  State.   A  pledge was given in the Assembly last sessionthat  there would  be  full opportunity for  discussion of the  Report before  the  final decisions were taken.  It would be convenient for us if, iu meeting the resolutions, wecould announce the main features of the scheme which we have outlined in this telegramas our  provisional conclusions and invite  the House  to express  its opinion,  weshould be careful to explain that our  proposals had  not yet  been sanctioned by HisMajesty&apos;s Government,  with whom  the  final decision  lies.   After  debate in  theAssembly we would propose to address  you by despatch dealing fully with the whole
           Telegram from Secretary of State to  Viceroy, dated 19th July 1927.    1989.   Army Department.   Your telegram of 18th duly, 1473 S.  Indian sandhurst committee Report.  Do  you intend Woolwich and Cranwell  cadets to get King&apos;commissions for  the present or Dominion Commissions from the beginning?  Pleasereply urgently.          Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 29th July 1927.   2099.  Army Department.   Your telegram of the  18th July, No. 1473 S.  IndianSandhurst Committee Report.  It has not been possible  in the time available before the rising of Parliament  to obtain  the opinion of the Committee of Imperial Defence on your proposals, and I should not be  justified in assuming that War Office and the AirMinistry will not oppose the policy of a self-contained  Dominion Army as the ultimategoal of Indianisation.   In these circumstances  its announcement by you, however much guarded by au explanation  that it was provisional and that the final decisiolay with His  Majesty&apos;s Government, could not  but  lead  to  difficulties.    In  some quarters the announcement would  almost certainly be  taken to  be the consideredpolicy of Government and there would be risk of charges of breach of faith ; and inany case the disclosure of differences between your  Government and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on so important a matter would be embarrassing.   I regret, therefore, that I cannot agree to the announcement of the policy which you propose.   The question remains whether  it would  still be  possible to  announce  yourprovisional views on points of detail mentioned in the last paragraph of your telegram.An announcement of 25 vacancies at Sandhurst would  be  misleading, for it would naturally be taken as implying the replacement of 15  more British  officers a yearby Indians, wheieas your actual intention, as I understand  it,  was  to utilise theadditional  15 Sandhurst cadets to  replace officers with the Viceroy&apos;s  Commission.As  regards the Woolwich and Cranwell cadetships the indications are  that WarOffice and Air Ministry are as strongly opposed as ever to the grant of King&apos;commissions, and the announcement yoxi propose, in advance of a Cabinet decision in support of it, would be only less embarrassing than an announcement on the major question of Army organisation. An announcement of the two minor  questions that remain would, you will agree, serve no purpose.   I regret, therefore, that I must ask you to make no  statement at all of your viewson the questions arising out of the Indian Sandhurst Report.  I recognise that this may expose your Government to  criticism in the Assembly ;  but there has been no time for adequate consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the large  questions raised  by the Report, and the undertaking to the Assembly did not go  beyond a promise that an opportunity for discussion would  be given wdien the Government ofIndia, after consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government, were in a position  to informthe Assembly.     Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary  of State for India,  dated                                20th August 1927.  i,   1702 S.  Your telegram of the I9th July, 1989.  Typo of commission for woolwich and Cranwell  cadets.  Our recommendation is  that Indians passing out of Cranwellshould not be granted full King&apos;s Commission, but exact form of  commission to begiven to them will  be  reserved for farther consideration.  Indians passing out. of woolwich should have  precisely same type of commission as Indians passing outof Sandhurst, for the reason that they will be as much members of the Indian army as Indians who come from Sandhurst&quot;question.   IE you  consider  that  disclosure of any  of our proposals,  even on  this understanding, might prove  embarrassing to His Majesty&apos;s Government, we would do our best to say nothing under that particular head.   But it would help us considerably in meeting inevitable criticism to be able to announce the  following: namely, the reservation  of 25 vacancies annually  at  Sandhurst,  8 at Woolwich  and  2 atOranweli;  the  grant  of scholarships  and the appointment  of a  specially selectedofficer on the active list as oflicial  guardian to Indian  cadets in England.
*                                        s  Despatch No. 38, from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary  of  State for  India,                              dated 13th October 1927.                       Indian Sandhurst Committees Report.My Lord,       Iu paragraph 11  of  our Army Department telegram  No.  1473  S., datedthe  18th July, we stated our intention of  addressing  Your  Lordship by despatchon the whole subject of the Indian Sandhurst Committee&apos;s Report after the debate iuthe  Simla session  of  the Legislative  Assembly.  A Resolution Avas  moved  in theLegislative  Assembly urging  the  immediate adoption  of the  recommendations inthe  Report.  The debates  on the Resolution took  place on  the 25th August andthe  13th September, and  there  was a debate on a similar  Resolution in the Councilof  State on the  31st  August.   We  invite  Your Lordship&apos;s attention to  theseproceedings.   2. Lord  Reading&apos;s  Government informed Your Lordship at the  time  of theappointment  of  the Committee that the scope of the  first  term of reference to theCommittee was merely the ascertainment of means by which the Government of india could obtain for  existing vacancies competitors  of better  quality and  in  larger numbers.  They  observed that  the  larger  question of  accelerating  the  pace ofIndianisation in the Army was, in their opinion, not one  which could profitably beentrusted to  the investigation of the Committee.  Your &quot;Lordship, in your telegramNo. 1S49, dated 7th July 1925, noted this explanation of the first term of reference,but, added that  it  remained to  be seen  how  far the Committee would deal effectuallywith the second  term (whether it is desirable  and practicable to establish a MilitaryCollege  in India) without at the same time  approaching wider  issues.  It must beadmitted that the  Committee have addressed themselves principally to acceleratedIndianisation, and have relegated the question of the improvement of  the quality of candidates more or less to the background.   Their primary recommendation is that asubstantial and progressive scheme for the Indianisalion of the  Indian  Army beadopted  without delay.   This scheme is set forth  in Appendix  II, and  its  main features  are summarised in paragraph 21 of  the Report.  Accelerated  Indianisationof the commissioned ranks of the Army  was part of  the policy advocated  in theLegislative Assembly Resolution which led to  the appointment of the Indian sandhurst committee.   Although  it  was deliberately left out of  the terms of reference to theCommittee for the  reasons given above, the  Committee, in their proceedings, appearto have  concentrated more and more upon it, aud there is no doubt  that the public for a considerable time past have supposed that the object of the appointment of theCommittee was  to consider further measures of Indianisation.  Speaking  in  theLegislative Assembly  on  the  loth September  last,  Mr.  Jinnah, a member  ofthe Committee, said :  &quot; The policy was and I do not want the  House to forget it to accelerate the Indianisation  of  the  officer ranks of  the  Army in India.  Thosewere, inter alia, the terms of reference  to the Committee.&quot;  The argument which theCommittee used to justify their embarking on a wider problem than  was specificallyreferred  to them will be found in paragraph  20 of the Report.  It is, briefly, that solong as vacancies  available for  Indian  candidates are  limited to ten a year with no prospect, of increase, it would be useless to adopt, other measures for the improvementof the supply of  candidates.   3. We did not think it desirable to stress  the fact that the recommendations of theCommittee had gone be.yond what the Government of India intended.  Looking  backon the  event, it seems to us inevitable that, this  should have happened.  If theCommittee had not amplified the first term of reference, they  would have raised thequestion of further fndianisation, as Your Lordship foresaw, on the second.  It wouldhave been idle to propound a scheme for a military college with an annual outturn often  officers only a  point which  did  not  escape  the  Committee (paragraph 44).The Committee, in. a note to paragraph 0  of their Report, quoted the Resolution,accepted by Government in the  Legislative Assembly on the  28th March 192.1, to theeffect that not less than 25 per cent, of the  King&apos;s commissions granted every year should be given to His  Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects to start with.   They must also havebeen aware of the fact stated in paragraph U of our telegram that the Government ofIndia recommended this proposal to the Secretary of  State.  They doubtless felt, thatthey were  justified in  putting forward a policy which the Government of India hadformally adopted in 1921, but had  so far doue nothing to cany out.   Moreover, the language of  the foreword with which we  published  the Report  implied that we
 acquiesced in the course taken  by the Committee, and that we were prepared to deal with the Report as a scheme for progressive Indianisation.  Finally, as we informed Your Lordship in paragraph 6 of our telegram of  the  18th July 1927, an increase of Indianisation is  necessary to the scheme which we ourselves  propose.  Accordingly the  Commander-in-Chief,  speaking  in  the  Legislative  Assembly,  accepted  the conclusion of the Committee on this  point, and made it  clear that the Government intended  to  deal  with the Report on those  lines.  There was,  and  is  still,  some apprehension, accentuated by the delay in publishing the Report, by the fact that it was thought necessary to prefix a foreword to it, and  by the decision not to publish. the report of the Sub-Committee which visited Europe and America, that Government would welcome an excuse to evade, or at any rate postpone, action on the  Report.   If wc had lent further colour to this idea by  emphasising in the course of the debates thai the Committee had exceeded their terms of reference and ought not to have dealt with accelerated Indianisation,  we should only have excited greater hostility, at  the time, and weakened our subsequent position, when our proposals become public.    4.  Having,  however,  recommended a  policy  of  increased  Indianisation,  the Committee could  not, without  palpably  exceeding their  terms  of  reference, advise in detail on the method of carrying it into effect.  They therefore contented  them- selves with condemning  the  present  eight-unit  system  as  an  invidious  form  of segregation, and recommending that  Indian officers should be eligible, as previously, for admission into all units of  cavalry, infantry and pioneers.   We regard this verdict on the principle of the eight-unit scheme  as unreal.  There is nothing invidious in a policy of  Indianisation by units.   The Indian officers who are posted  to the units in question are serving, and will serve for many  years to come, with British officers, meeting as equals  in the mess  and in their sports and games, and, as was stated both by British and Indian King&apos;s commissioned officers in their evidence before the Committee, living together on the friendliest terms.   To call such a state of affairs segregation seems to us absurd ; and we have formed the  impression that those Indian  officers wdio  used such  expressions  in  their evidence  before  the  Committee  were not  altogether unprompted.  One of them, for  instance,  mentioned that he had taken the  word &quot; segregation &quot; from a newspaper.  We should have expected young Indian officers to welcome a scheme that entrusts to  them  wdiole battalions to make their own, Avhile assuring them  of the control and guidance of British officers until they reach the seniority requisite for  command.  The real objection to the eight-unit scheme in  its present form is not that it is invidious in character,  but that it is too narrow in scope.   On the other hand,  the proposal to  draft young Indian  officers  together  w-ith British officers  into all units would not only dissipate the experiment over the whole army, but also indefinitely postpone its results.  If  the Committee&apos;s recommendations were accepted and candidates were forthcoming in  the numbers laid dowrn by them,it would follow that by 1952 half the officers of the Indian Army would  be Indians serving with approximately equal numbers of British officers in each unit.   Battalionswould be  neither British-officered nor  Indianised ;  and the Government of India ofthat time would be little, if at all, nearer than we are now to answering the questionwhether Indian officers can undertake without aid the leadership  and command of large bodies  of troops.  If, however,  we retain the system of  the eight units, thoseunits should be officered entirely by Indians  some years before  1952.   5. While we therefore accept the Committee&apos;s recommendation for increasing the number of King&apos;s commissions to be  granted  to Indians, we consider it essential to frame a policy which will both define the goal  of  Indianisation to  be ultimatelyreached, and  provide in detail the method of reaching it.   Our aim, if  we can obtain sufficient officer material, is the eventual creation of a &quot;Dominion&quot;  army, that is, an army manned and  officered throughout by Indians, and comprising all arms in whichIndians desire to  serve and to  bear commissioned  rank.  It is through the creation of such a force that India can  fulfil her aspirations and  ultimately undertake the responsibility for  any part of  her own  defence  by laud.  We do not  attempt to forecast at this stage  to  what extent the &quot; Dominion &quot; army will  in time  replace either British troops  or British-officered Indian troops.  We feel, however, that any further  expansion  of  Indianisation in  the  Indian  Army should  follow the  general principle of the eight-units scheme, i.e. that Indian officers must be trained by, and in association with, British officers in units set aside for the purpose, with the object of assuming in due course the command  of such  units, and thereafter, if the experiment succeeds, rising to higher command in Indianised forces.       [16921]
   6. We have recommended increasing the vacancies for direct commissions throughSandhurst to 20 as proposed  by the Committee, and giving five commissions annually,through  Sandhurst also, to young officers  holding the  Viceroy&apos;? Commission.  We donot suggest any programme for increasing these numbers until we have full experienceof the results of  the initial step.   As stated in para. 3 of our telegram of the 18th July,we propose that the officer  establishment of Indianised units should eventually be assimilated to that of  British battalions, and  that  Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers should  gradually disappear  from  them.  In  reaching  this  conclusion, we  wereinfluenced  by several considerations.  In the first place, where Indian  troops areto be officered by Indians there should be no need for a link between officers and mensuch as  is provided  by the  existing class of  Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers;  andit is clearly desirable that an Indian officer in an Indian regiment, like the british officer  in a British  regiment, should learn his work in that close association withthe men which  is  involved  by the leadership of a  troop or platoon.  Secondly, aconsiderable proportion of the candidates for  the Iving&apos;s commission will  always besupplied by what are for convenience called  the &quot; martial&quot; races, from whom theexisting  personnel  of  the Indian  Army  are  drawn.   The  Committee, it is  true,recommend that, in selecting candidates for commissions, preference for soldiers&apos; sonsshould in future become the exception rather than the rule;  and they quote a high authority in the  present  Governor of the Punjab to  the  effect that this  preference should not be made a fixed item in  the policy of selection.  We anticipate, however,that whether a preference for families with military connections be shown iu selectionor not, as a matter  of fact the bulk  of the caudidates will still come from these&quot;martial&quot;  classes.   Sir Malcolm Hailey  himself  said no more than  that he would always  be prepared  to admit a proportion of  men  from the professional classes,provided that candidates came forward with  the necessary qualifications, and  withthe appearance  of  having the temperament necessary  to make good officers.   we need not emphasise the futility  of  perpetuating  superior and subordinate types of commission, where both  types  are  held   by  officers  of the  same classes  and  evenfamilies.  On the other hand, there are indications of uneasiness among the classesto which we  have referred,  and to which the majority of  Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers belong, at the prospect of  a large influx of Indian King&apos;s commissioned officers with no military traditions and no previous connection with the army.   The relationsbetween  officers of this kind and  the old-fashioned  Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officerwithin  units are  likely to be difficult ; friction and consequent inefficienc3r may ensue.Whichever class of  King&apos;s  commissioned  officer prevails,  therefore,  the  Yiceroy&apos;scommissioned officer should be eliminated from a completely Indianised force.   7. We found some difficulty in deciding on the  most suitable time for bringing theofficer  establishments of Indianising units into conformity with the British pattern.There  are  two  possible courses.   The first,  to which some of  us were inclined,is to  continue  posting  Indian  officers  in  replacement  of  British  officers alone,until such time as  the  number of Indian  cadets  approaches the maximum thatSandhurst  could accommodate.   The reconstruction of officer establishments on theBritish pattern  would  then  follow  naturally  upon the establishment of  a militarycollege in  India.  In order to absorb the increased entry of  Indian officers, it wouldbe necessary to  begin  adding to the  number of Indianising units  earlier than itwould  be if  the British  pattern  were adopted at once.   This would  be done byear-marking for  Indianisation, as  occasion required, battalions in regiments or groupsthat did  not already contain  an Indianising battalion.   The great advantage of thiscourse is that  it involves a  minimum of dislocation.  The  eight units  would be expanded, within strictly defined limits, exactly in proportion as more Indian officersbecame available.  At  the same time,  the sentimental  demand that the status and functions of the  Indian  officer should be in all respects similar to those of the british officer  in the Indian Army would  remain satisfied until  the  moment  when a more practical aspiration, namely,  an Indian Military College, had  become a reality.  Themain objection  to the plan is that  it would multiply the number of  Indian officers with the ordinary King&apos;s Commission indefinitely, since we cannot foretell when thefull  quota that Sandhurst can accommodate will be exceeded ;  and so long as Indians.join the Army with the same status as British officers it would  be difficult, for thereasons  given in para.  4 of our telegram, to confer on them a different form of commission.  Those of us who favoured postponement of the reconstruction of officerestablishments  were, however, agreed that this  change should be announced,  as a development to  take place later, at the  same time  as the other decisions on the
Committee^  Report.  After much  deliberation,  we concluded that the  longer wopostponed  the actual change,  the  greater  would  be its difficulty, and that thereconstruction should begin  as  soon as  the opening of the 25 vacancies produces a supply of Indian  officers ready for posting  to Indian Army units, over and above what is necessary to  replace British officers in the eight  units.  This will not  takeplace before  October  1931 at the earliest.  Our  final  recommendation is, therefore,to appoint Indians to specified units, in the manner described in paras. 4 aud 5 of our telegram, until a continuous supply of good material is available iu greater numbersthan Sandhurst can take.  At that  point the Government of India would be facedwith  the obligation to establish  a  military college in India.   In the meantime, weshould contemplate contiuuing to post Indians to specified units in  place  of british officers, so  long as such vacancies  cau be made  available.  There is, of course, no intention of appointing Indians to be Squadron or Company Commanders  until  theyhave the requisite seniority.  If aud when such vacancies  are no longer available, weshould propose to post Indians to  the uuits  in  vacancies created by the transfer ofViceroy&apos;s commissioned officers.   S. A scheme by which Indian  King&apos;s  commissioned officers are merely substitutedfor Viceroy&apos;s  commissioned officers  appears at first sight  to constitute no advance inIndianisation, but rather to deprive Indians to some extent of the opportunities whichthey already  possess, and our proposals will almost certainly  be criticised in this sense.  The argument is, however, theoretical and political rather than practical, and ought not, iu our  opinion, to  deter  candidates who  have  a military career at heart.To the cadet  himself it makes no difference in his prospects of promotion whether hebegins his  career as a platoou leader or a company officer.  In either  case he willbe promoted  to the command of a company at the same stage iu his service, i.e.  after about 16 or  17 years.   To meet  political criticism it  can be pointed out that whilethe proposal admittedly  does not  add to the  total  number  of Indians holdingcommissions  of one type or the other iu  the Indian Army, it more than doubles thenumber of King&apos;s Commissions available to Indians.   We  have  carefully considered whether the closing of Viceroy&apos;s commissions  inIndiauising units will have a harmful effect  on  recruitment.   We  think this  most unlikely.  The rank aud file will still be eligible for Viceroy&apos;s commissions in other,non-Indianising, units of the same regiment or group, while our proposals for grantingKing&apos;s Commissions to selected Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers will greatly improve the prospects of this class of officer as a whole.   9. We have recommended that, for  the present, Indian officers recruited underthe new conditions should continue to receive the  same type of commission as  british officers, and the same  rates of pay, less an overseas element which will not be grantedto Indians who enter Sandhurst after the inauguration of our proposals.   We  havenot yet elaborated details under either of  these  heads.  We are unanimously  ofopinion, however,  that  the type of commission should  be a  King&apos;s  Commission,limited, like the King&apos;s Commission  in the Royal  Indian Marine and in the proposed new- Indian Navj-, to the force in which it is granted.   10. We now turn to  the question of  the  admission of Indians to Woolwich andCranwell for  service in the Artillery, Engineers and Air Force.   We have already informed Your Lordship that we recommend acceptance of the Committee&apos;s proposal that eight vacancies should be available annually at Woolwich and two at Cranwellto Indians, on the  condition that Indian candidates should  be required to pass thesame  entrance  tests as British  boys.  The Committee have  not  made  it clear how they intend that Indians graduating  from these colleges should be employed on  their return to India.  It might be inferred from para.  22 of the Report  that they meantsuch officers  to be employed in British service units,  an arrangement  which we recognise to be impossible.  We have, however, in the Indian Mountain  Batteries an organisation into which Indian officers passing out of Woolwich can be absorbed.  Ifthey are forthcoming, it will probably be necessary to set, apart a battery, and  later on batteries, for Indianisation, in  the same way as units of the cavalry and infantry.We wish to emphasise that Indian Mountain Batteries are  integral parts of  the  indian army, and that Indian King&apos;s commissioned officers  in these batteries must be giventhe same status  in  all respects  as  Indian  King&apos;s commissioned officers  fromSandhurst.   The same considerations apply to Iudians  who pass out of Woolwich  asEngineer officers, and are  employed in  Sapper and Miner battalions.   Here  also  itwill probably be necessary to earmark  certain  units  for Indianisation.  A further      [16921]                                                          b 2
and useful opportunity for the employment of  Indian Engineer officers will be offered by the Military Engineering Services.  We endorse the committee&apos;s recommendation that Indians should be eligible to serve in India in the Signal Corps, in which againit would probably be  found expedient to establish a separate Indianising unit as soonas a sufficient number of Indian King&apos;s commissioned officers becomes available.   Asregards Cranwell and the employment of Indians in an Air Force, we have little to add to a memorandum  on  this  subject by Air Vice-Marshal Sir W.  G. 11. Salmond,Commanding Royal Air Force in India, a copy of which we enclose.   The creation ofan Indian Air Force will necessitate some legislation, there being at present no IndianAir Force Act.  This matter  does  not,  however, require  instant decision, as sometime will elapse before  any Indian  cadet may be expected  to pass  out of Granwell.For the same reason the exact form of commission  to  be granted to  Indian Air force officers may be left for later consideration as recommended in our telegram  No. 17G2 S,dated the  28th August 1927.   We  trust  that your Lordship will impress upon  theArmy  and  Air Councils the importance of  rendering Indian  cadets  eligible  for admission to Woolwich and Cranwell to  the limited extent proposed. Although wedo not anticipate a large number of candidates for these vacancies,  the mere fact  of opening the twro colleges to Indians  will gratify Indian public opinion and remove along-standing grievance.   11. The Committee  have  not touched upon the employment of  Indian officers in ancillary units and departments such as the Indian Army Service Corps, Indian ArmyOrdnance Corps,  Army Remount Department, Military Farms  Department, &amp;c,  orin the Cantonments  Department, the Survey of India,  the Foreign and  PoliticalDepartment, and other civil departments into which Indian Army officers are permitted to transfer.   We consider that Indians should be eligible, if qualified,  to serve in anyof these departments.   There are,  as   j&apos;Our  Lordship  is  aware,  Indian  King&apos;scommissioned officers  already serving in the Foreign and Political Department.   12. The Committee  have severely criticised the present methods  of selection  ofIndian candidates for Sand hurst in para. 14 of the Report.  While we are notconviucedthat  the  various official stages to  wdiich the  Committee  refer  have the  effect  ofdeterring suitable  candidates,  we  are  prepared  to adopt the  recommendationsnumbered (x) and (xi) in Appendix I of the Report, in so far as the)7 are applicableto candidates for Sandhurst.   We do not think  that the  local  advisory  committeessuggested  in  recommendation (xiii)  would   serve a  useful  purpose.   their recommendations would have no authority, and as soon as they found, as they might,that  their views  were  disregarded  by candidates or  over-ruled  by the  selectingauthority, they would  cease to function with  enthusiasm or efficiency.  Indeed, it isdifficult to see what inducement could be offered to non-officials to serve on such committees at all.  In practice, the submission of applications direct  to a centralauthority will probably uot eliminate  the local officials through whom applicationsmust now be sent.  The central axithority will in  most cases require the opinion ofthese local officials as  well as that of the authorities of the school or college in wdiichthe candidate was  educated.   We  are, however,  in agreement with  the  Committeethat  District Officers and  Commissioners should  not retain the power  to reject a candidate&apos;s application themselves.   We have no objection to the minor  recommendation of  the Committee in para. 27of the Report, that a non-official Indian gentleman nominated by the Viceroy should sit on the Board that  conducts the interview test.   13. We entirely concur  with the  Committee&apos;s observations in paras. 11 and 24 ofthe Report on the defects of the educational system in India, and the necessity for animprovement before a steady flow of first-class candidates can be expected.  The loweducational standard of  candidates who at present  offer themselves for Sandhurst  iswell known and has become a source of growing anxiety.   We are  doubtful whetherthe recommendation  of  the Sub-Committee  quoted in para. 24,  namely, that  theimportance  of the matter should  be  brought to the  notice  of  the  educationalauthorities and their co-operation  enlisted,  will  in  itself  have very rmich effect.Reform in this respect  can  only  be achieved by public opiniou and effort.  Thequality  of candidates for  the  existing&quot; vacancies shows  at present no signs  of improving, and the selection authorities are  confronted with the dilemma of eithereaving vacancies unfilled or of sending to Sandhurst boys who have but little chanceof passing out, and so enhancing the already high  percentage of failure  referred toIn para. 9 of  the  Report.  We hope that the measures adopted as the result of the
Committees recommendations will improve the situation, and we think that  there isforce in the contention  that the present supply is adversely restricted by the small number of vacancies offered.  At  the same time we are not sanguine that the wholeof the vacancies which we propose to  declare can be regularly  filled  from  now onwards by candidates with a  reasonable  prospect of passing out of Sandhurst.  Itis, however, possible that the methods of publicity proposed in para. 26 of the report may help  to discover good material, and we intend to follow the recommendations inthat paragraph.    14. The Committee  mentioned the expense of Sandhurst as one  of  the  factors which deters suitable candidates from  coming forward.  We agree with their viewthat the expenditure involved is beyond the capacity of the average  Indian  parentbelonging to the middle classes.  We have proposed as a  remedy, in  para. 8 of our telegram of the 18th July 1927, the institution of Government grants proportionate tothe pecuniary needs of individual cadets, to  enable them  to meet the expenses ofeducation  at Sandhurst, Woolwich  or Cranwell.   This will relieve  young  indian officers who pass out of Sandhurst  of a  heavy financial handicap  at the outset oftheir service, and  those  who  fail  of  a  dead loss which  further embitters  theirdisappointment.   It  will  incidentally counteract the only valid argument againstcreating an overseas element in the  pay  of military officers and treating Indians inthis respect in the same way as Indians in the  Civil Services.    15. We  concur  generally  in  the recommendations made by the  Committee in para. 34 of the Report for  the  improvement of the system of  guardianship.   Wherethe cadet or his  parents are in a position to select a personal friend as guardian, we agree that such  a  person  should  be approximately^pointed, but subject to  the approval of theSecretary of State.   We agree also  that  the official  guardian appointed  to look aftersuch cadets as are  unable  to find a personal guardian should  be  selected with theutmost care.   He should iu our opinion  be more directly amenable  to  control than are tired officer can be, and for this reason we have  iwoposed that the post should be filled by  an officer on the active list.   In framing this recom men elation we  haveignored the personal strictures of the Sub-Committee which visited  Sandhurst on thepresent official guardian.   Those strictures were obviously biassed, and in any case we are concerned, not with individuals, but with the system.    16. We think that  the above  measures  should remove  whatever  obstacles atpresent exist to prevent Indian youths of  the right stamp  and  inclinations  from entering upon a  military career.  As we  have explained in para. 7  of our telegram,we do not wish  to set up  an Indian military college  so  long as Sandhurst canaccommodate  the annual  entry  of  Indian cadets.   The Comnrittee  emphasise theimportance of placing  the machinery of  the  Indian Military College  on  the highestplane of efficiency which India  can attain.   We do not consider that  such a college,if inaugurated now, or  as  early as 1933, the year  proposed by the Committee, wouldbe comparable with Sandhurst as a producer of  efficient  Indian   officers, howevergreat the pains that were  bestowed  upon it.  We  do not wish  to  see such a collegeestablished before  there is reasonable  prospect of its being an institution  of thehighest class.  This will not occur until Indian officers of proved capacity, themselvesgraduates of Sandhurst, are available to take part, with British officers,  in the conductof the Indian college; nor before candidates  of the requisite stamp are available in larger numbers than can be accepted by Sandhurst itself.    17. We are in sympathy with the remarks in para. 29 of the Committee&apos;s report about the grant of University Commissions and the  inability of  Indians at present toenter the  Officers&apos; Training Corps at Universities.   We have represented this matter on several  occasions,  and  we are  aware  that your Lordship has  supported  our representations to  the  authorities  concerned.  We hope  that the university  andmilitary authorities  in England may in time be induced to reconsider  their  decision,and to allow Indian students to become members of the Officers&apos;  Training Corps.    18. We  trust that His Majesty&apos;s Government  will give early  and  sympathetic consideration to  our proposals.&apos;  The  problem is  one of great complexity and has remained  too long unsolved.  We have endeavoured to avoid the error of submitting proposals for increased Indianisation without fully  estimating the implications ofsuch  proposals.   Our aim  is to design a structure, based on clear  principles, whichwill successfully function when complete, and involve a minimum of risk while  it isbeing built up.  As we observed in our telegram, if Indianisation  means a loss of
  1. I wish to  record the fact that, during thewhole of the proceedings of the Indian sandhurst committee,  no  evidence, as  far  as I know,  was called for from the R.A.F. in India.  This appearsto bo extremely difficult to understand  when theReport  contains definite recommendations affectingthis Service.   2.  Terms of reference. The  terms of reference of the  Committee were  framed  witli a view toenquiring  into the further  Indianisation  of theIndian Army.  The substitution of British Officersby Indians in Units outside the India U Army suchas the British Army  in India, was clearly not within the terms  of reference.   The  R.A.F. inIndia is on the same footing as the British Armyin India, consequently  the terms  of reference didnot include the consideration of   Indian Officersbeing trained to substitute  British Officers in theR.A.F. in India.   On tho other hand, in the firstterm of reference, it may beheld that the Committeewas entitled to consider the question  of the supplyof Indian candidates for the King&apos;s Commission ina unit yet to  be  formed such  as an Indian AirForce Squadron.  Assuming that this was the intention, the reconi-mendation  contained in para. 22  of the  report has to be considered. This  recommendation statesthat &quot; the  refusal of  commissions in the  R.A.F.is,  in  our opinion, singularly  indefensible,&quot; &amp;c.This means either  (a) that Indians  should be coin-missioned  in the R.A.F. in India,  or (b)  that they.should be commissioned in order  that  ultimatelythey should form part of an Indian Air Force unit in India.  With  regard  to (a).  As already stated,  thisproposal is, in my opinion,  outside the  terms ofreferonce. &apos; The  R.A.F. in India are on the same footing  as the British  Avmy in India;  if Indianswere commissioned in  the  R.A.F. in India,  they-would be liable to  serve in the Royal Air Force inall parts of the world where units of this service were  stationed.   It  would  be  impracticable  to guarantee that they would always remain as officersof R.A.F. units in India; to do so would be creating a precedent never before established.  This principle without question would be unacceptable to the air council.  As regards (6).  This solution involves a policywhich  has, hitherto, not been considered.   It isdesirable, however, owing to  the general trend ofIndianisation, that the question  of  the ultimateformation of  an  Indian  Air Service should  be explored.  In this connection it should be notedthat no  general  desire  to  fly has  been shown by the three hundred million  inhabitants of India.Compare this state of affairs to that  in Englandwhen flying became possible in 1907.  Not  onlydid young men rush  to be trained at the variousschools, but they  went so far  as to  do  so underassumed  names in  order that  their parents shouldbe kept in ignorance  of what  they  were  doing;moreover, they did this at their own expense audbefore any service outlet for flying had been decided upon.   In England,  therefore, tho  background  ofthe desire to  fly existed from  the outset.  This,certainly, has not  been the case in India.  Duringthe Great War, it is believed four Indians offeredthemselves and were trained for service with theR.A.F.,  of which one distinguished  himself  andone was killed in action.  It may be contended thatthis reluctance to fly was due to  the  fact  that facilities for flying did not exist in India.  Howevertrue this may be, the facilities for flying are now about to be afforded in consequence of the formationof light aeroplanH clubs in India under the Directorof Civil Aviation.  When Indians, as a result  ofthe formation of these clubs, show that they  havea desire  and capacity to fly,  then, in my opinion,it will be time to  proceed  with the training  ofIndian  cadets  at  Cranwell.   Such  a procedure would  have the  added  advantage  that,  beforeIndians were sent to undergo an expensive training efficiency, that  loss  must be made good iu  other ways.   Our Army at  its present strength barely suffices for  the external aud internal  defences of ,the country.   The outlook  on our frontiers is not without anxiety ; in India the communal  situation has probably  never  been  more  strained.   We have  received  from  almost every Local Government a demand  for an increase of troops for internal security  purposes.   The Indianisation  of the  officer  ranks  of the Indian  Army  manifestly  involves  a great experiment and a great change.  We cannot afford to make that experiment with the Indian Army as a whole.  By  providing for the  gradual evolution of  a  distinctive Indian-officered force comprising all  arms we hope not only to  initiate progress upon the right lines, but also to appeal to the patriotism of Iudians of the educated classes, and evoke in them a more widespread and genuine desire to bear arms  in defence of their country than can be said to exist at present.                                                  We have, &amp;c,                                                        (Signed)    W. li.  BIKDWOOD,                                                                           etc.,    &amp;c.Letter  from Secretary to Government of India to India Office, dated 10th October 1927.Sir,        I  am  directed  to state, for the information of the  Secretary of  State for indian Council, that His Excellency the Viceroy approved  the Army Department despatch no. 38,  dated  the  13th  October, before leaving Simla on  tour on the 10th October,but the despatch could  not be completed for signature  by that date.   His  Lxcellencydesired this to be conveyed to the India Office, to explain  the absence of his signaturefrom the Despatch.                                                                     I have, &amp;c,                                                                           G. M. YOUNG.                                 ENCLOSURE TO DESPATCH.      Memorandum by the Air Officer Commanding Royal Air Force in India on the Report                             of the Indian Sandhurst Committee.
in  England, the  possibility  of  their  failing atCranwcll  would  be,  to  a  large extent, lessened.This  procedure  should   be  welcome  by  Indianparents as  not  only safeguarding  their financial interests but also preventing subsequent misunder-standing and disappointment.  3. The system recommended for the developmentof an Indian Air Force is as follows :   Cadets should be selected from those qualifyingat any one  of the following educational establish-mcjnts :       (a)  Dchm Dun,      (i) A British Public School,      (c) An approved Indian Public School,if and when established.  They should be requiredto pass the same examination as  British cadetsbefore entering Cranwell.   The examination shouldbe competitive.  Successful candidates should thenqualify for their &quot; A  &quot; certificate at one of the lightaeroplane  clubs  in India.   The standard of flyingrequired to obtain this certificate is of an elementarynature and would, in  the normal course, require nolonger than four to  six  months&apos;  tuition.  In theevent of failure, the next on the competitive list asa result of  the examination should be selected, andso on.  The cadets   finally  selected  would  then proceed to Cranwell.   After graduating at. Cranwcll,they  would be gazetted  to a  Commission  in theIndian Air Force and return  to India, where theywould be attached  to Regular  Royal  Air Force squadrons,  pending the formation of a unit of theIndian Air Force.  4. The type of commission  and the status it willconfer in  relation to a   King&apos;s Commission orViceroy&apos;s  Commission is  a matter for subsequentdecision.  It is understood that a similar questionis under consideration by  Army Headquarters, andit seems probable that, whatever solution is  reachedregarding commissioned officers in the  Indianisedunits in  the Army, the same will be suitable for officers of the Indian Air Force.  It is clear that Indian officers of the Indian Armyand Indian Air Force should have equivalent status.  5. It  is  considered essential  that,  as  regardsestablishment and organisation,  the  squadrons ofthe Indian  Air Force should conform, as closely as possible,  to units of the British Air Force, thusconforming  with the  policy which has been followed in the case  of the Dominion Air Forces in Canada.South Africa and Australia.  These squadrons comprise  12 aircraft and a totalof 21  officers   (excluding  one  Medical  Officer)and are organised in three sub-formations termedFlights, each consisting of three machines with aFlight Commander and three pilots.   The squadronis commanded by a Squadron Leader (the equivalent in Army  Rank is Major).   Among  these officers,certain are required to possess specialist qualificationsto perform the  duties of Armament Officer, SignalOfficer and  Photographic  Officer.   The  trainingrequired   to  qualify officers  for these  functionscannot be carried out by units  of the  Royal AirForce  in  India.  But  there  are  special schools  of instruction in  England dealing with each of  these subjects, and selected Indian cadets, after qualifyingat Cranwell, will  have to undertake the course at these schools before returning to India.  6.  The  squadrons  of the  Royal Air  Force areclassified  according  to the functions  they perform,e.g.  Army Co-openvtion,  Fighting,  Bombing, &amp;c.After consideration,  it  is thought  that  the typemost suitable to the  requirements of  an Indian AirForce  is  the Army Co-operation Squadron ;  theestablishment  and organisation  quoted  above arethose appertaining to this type.  7.  The development suggested  for the raising  ofan Indian Air Force  Squadron is as follows: Stage I. Squadron   Leader,  Royal Air  Force             (Commanding Officer).        (n)  Squadron H.Q..  partly R.A.F., partly-               Indian.         (b)  One Flight,  Royal Air Force.         (c)  One Flight Indian, with  R.A.F. Flight               Commander.Stage II.  (a) and (6) as  in Stage I.         (c)  Two  Flights   Indian,  with  R.A.F.               Flight Commanders.Stage III.-(a) and  (6) as in Stage I.        Three Indian  Flights with  three Indian           Flight Commanders.Stage IV. Squadron as  Indian unit complete, aU             British personnel withdrawn.  8.  The  intake of  officers  at Cranwell proposedby the  Skeen  Report is  two per  annum.    Thefollowing  table  shows  the period  required to formsuch a squadron  by stages, assuming entries  toCrauwell  at  the  rate  of 2 and 3 per  annumrespectively.Annual Intake.	Poriod at Cranwell.

[-Vote. Tho figure for wastago (7) is possibly high, buta margin is  necessary to allow for  failures at Cranwell,resignation and&apos;casualties; any orodit balanco under this heading will bo an asset.]  Stages III and IV are tho important stages, sinceui Stage III  Indian Flight Commanders are appointed and in  Stage IV the command of the squadron willbetaken over by an Indian.  On an entry of two cadets per annum, pilots willhave had nine years&apos;  service by the time Stage IIIis reached ;  this period of training should be suffi.-ciont  to produce the required  number of  officers with  the necessary experience  to enable them toassume command of a Flight.  On an entry of three cadets per annum, thoy will only have had six years&apos; service.  **  As  regards Stage IV, on an entry  of three, pilotswill have had :     (a)  14 years&apos; service.     (6)  5 years as Flight Commander.
10th May 1927.as additional to,  and  not iu  substitution of.  theRoyal Air Force in India.  11.  Summarised.   my   observations  are   asfollows:    (i)  The  inclusion of Indian Officers and airmen      in British  units of the Royal Air Force is      impracticable.   (ii)  If scope is to be  provided  for  Indians  to      enter  the Held of military aviation, this can      best be accomplished  by creating an India U      Air Unit with a cadre of British personnel      to train and develop the unit: us  the Indian      officers  and   airmen  gain   the  necessary      experience, the British  personnel should  he      gradually withdrawn  until the unit becomes      entirely  Indian.  (iii)  The  unit  should be an Army Co-operation      squadron.  (iv)  Cadets should be drawn from :          Dehra Dun.         An English Public School.         An approved Indian Public School.   (v)  The  entry  to Cranwell should  be limited      to two per annum  and  should be the result      of a competitive  examination  similar to that      in force  for the entry of British cadets  into      Cranwell.   Before  proceeding to Cranwell,      cadets will be required to  pass  their &quot; A&quot;      certificate  at  un approved  light aeroplane      club in India.  (vi)  On passing out of Cranwell, cadets should      be commissioned and  should  be attached  to      Royal Air  Force squadrons  in units for a      period of years.  (vii)  Technical  personnel  should  be  enlisted in      India as  soon as  the first cadets  proceed to      Cranwell and  should  be  trained  at  tho      Aircraft Depot, Karachi. (viii)  The  squadron will commence forming as a      unit five years after the first cadets proceed      to Cranwell.  It will do so  in four stages,      the final stage being arrived at  14 years      after the date of  formation.  (ix)  No further squadrons will be formed until      further experience has been gained.   (x)  The addition of  au Indian  squadron to the      air strength in India must be additional to      the present authorised strength of the Royal      Air Force.     W. G. H.  SALMOND,  Air Vice Marshal,        Commanding Royal Air Force, India.     (a) 10 years&apos; service.     (6) 4 years as Flight Commander.  It  is considered  that  1-1- years&apos; service  is theminimum  period  of service an officer should  have before he is promoted to Squadron Leader.   (Theaverage is  17/18 years in the case of the british air  Force:)  Consequently un annual entry of two to Cranwell appears to be correct.  9.  OlIiT  Ranks Technical  Instruction. It   hasnot  been found possible even in  England with itslarge supply  of technical labour to recruit artisanspossessing tho necessary  technical ability to justify their direct entry to the  R.A.F. units.  It  has been found  necessary  to set  up special training  establishments  where  recruits  undergo a course of training from one to three years accordingto the  different trades  concerned.   In India nosuch  specialised training organisation  exists.  Avery high standard of technical training is essential,and  it would be, therefore,  useless to minimise thodifficulty  of supplying that standard of technical efficiency in  an  Indian squadron  without which itcannot function.  However, it is  satisfactory to note that, at theR.A.F.  Uepdt, Karachi,  certain  Indian technical personnel  have  attained  the necessary standard incertain  trades, and  it  is  therefore proposed to en-deavonr to utilise this unit for the training of thetechnical personnel required.  It  is  suggested that, us soon as the first entriesof cadets  proceed  to  Cranwell,  the complementof personnel  to complete the first stage, including an allowance for  wastage,  should be enlisted andattached to the R.A.F.  Depot, India,  for instruc-tion.  This would give  them  five years&apos;  training before the first Flight was formed.  Further stageswould be treated  in the same way.  An instruc-tional staff of British personnel  in proportion tothe numbers of Indians under  training would haveto be added to the Depot for this purpose.  10. Finally, I would   emphasise the fact   thatthe  eight  squadrons now sanctioned for the RoyalAir Force in this country is a bare minimum.   an indian  Air  Force  Squadron cannot,  for  manyyears, attain  the  efficiency of a  squadron of  theRoyal Force  and, therefore,  such an  increase in air strength in this country can only be looked upon
