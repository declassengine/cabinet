TO  BE  KEPT UNDER  LOCK  AND KEY.It is requested that special care may  be taken    to ensure the secrecy of this document.                 CABINET.REDUCTION OF  EXPENDITURE IN  1928.                   NOTE  BY CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.    IN  accordance with Cabinet 62 (27), Conclusion 3 (6), I circulate a summaryof the scheme for reducing expenditure, &amp;c, and avoiding new taxation, which Ilaid before my colleagues.    The Cabinet  may find it convenient to remind themselves of the terms of conclusion 3 (a) of the same Cabinet, viz.:         That, in the present political  situation, it is  out  of  the question to        contemplate an increase in Income Tax for the financial  year 1928-29,        and that every possible effort  must be made to achieve the economies        required  to balance the Budget  either by the measures proposed by the        Chancellor of the Exchequer or in other ways.    I also  attach a  copy  of the  reply  which the Prime Minister has sent to colonel  Gretton, the Chairman of the Economy Group of Conservative Members ofParliament.

                                BUDGET  1928.           Table of proposed Economies on October Forecast of Expenditure.  1. Transfer to Service Estimates of normal cost of Middle East Defence.       Net saving ....      ....       ....       ....       ....       ....       ....    1,000           (Total Air Estimates after  absorbing this cost, including their       share of Aden expenditure,  16  millions.)  2. Reduction of Army Estimates as compared with 1927      ....       ....     750           (Making a total of  40&apos;$ millions.)  3. Reduction of  Navy Estimates as compared with 1927 ......       ....    2,000           (Making,  with a shadow  cut oi i&apos;2   millions  as in  1927, a       total for 1928 of  56 millions.)  4. Reduction of  Board of Education Estimate      ....       ....       ....    1,000           The sketch Estimate shows an increase on 1927 of  2v millions,       of which    millions is consequent upon the grant due to Education       Authorities in  respect of the contribution  of  2  millions to be       made  by them  on  account of  Teachers&apos;  Pensions.  The proposed       reduction will leave an increase of  1* millions, of which  J million       will be real, the rest book-keeping.  5. Consequential saving on Scottish Education Estimate (-g^ths)      ....    140  6. Reduction of Ministry of Health Estimate        ....       ....       ....    500           Present Estimate shows an increase on  1927 of   12 million.       It is suggested  that the  required reduction  should be  effected  by       limiting the growth of grants for Health services.  7.  Limitation of Estimates for Police and Prisons, England, together,       to 1927 figure.   Saving on present Estimates  ....       ....       ....    170  8.  Reduction of Agricultural Estimates, England and Scotland       ....    175           In view of  the fact  that the  Scottish  share of Agricultural       expenditure far exceeds the  proportion of ^ths  and that  the       Scottish Vote has  doubled since  1922,  it  is considered  that it       should  contribute  100,000 of this amount.  9.  Closer estimate  of  Sugar Beet expenditure  in 1928.  Provisional       reduction of October forecast ....       ....       ....      ....       ....    70010.

Appendix.     FIXATION OF THE  ESTATE DUTY GRANT TO LOCAL TAXATION ACCOUNT.    IN  addition to grants mostly ou a percentage basis charged direct upon Votes,local authorities have since 1888 received assistance through the Local TaxationAccount.   Originally three sources of national  revenue were assigned  to this account, and on  it  were charged  various  grants previously made  from  theExchequer.  The growing produce of these revenues was  intended to provide forthe increased cost of the Pay and Clothing of the Police, and of the maintenanceof Main Roads,  in addition to providing a margin for Relief of Rates; the othergrants  charged  on the Account  being either fixed or  relatively stationary in amount.    Since this system was instituted the Account has been relieved of the growth of the  two main variable liabilities upon  it, viz., Police  and Main  Roads.  Thecharge  in respect of Police is now  fixed  at the figure for 1914-15, the balancerequired to  make this up to half the total  cost of Police  being found from Votes,while an entirely new grant has been  provided  from the Road Fund for MainRoads,  without  any reduction being  made  in  tho money  going to the local taxation Account.    On the Revenue  side, the Establishment Licence Duties  have  been  handedi   3i&quot; to the  local authorities for collection, and all the other revenues payable intothe Account, except the Estate Duty Grant, have been stereotyped.   It  is nowproposed that the Estate Duty Grant, which is liable to considerable variation,should  be fixed at the average of the three years prior to  the current year, viz.,i&apos;4,360,000,  which  corresponds  very closely with  the  original estimate  for thisgrant for  the current year,  viz., i&apos;4,400,000.   Owing to the  unexpectedly highproduce of  the Estate Duty for the current year the actual amount payable, if no steps are taken to limit  the amount, may reach 1*5,000,000.  Thus fixing the grantis likely to  reduce the payment in the current year by 1*600,000, and may lead to a saving  next year of approximately  500,000.   It can  probably  be arranged that both savings are brought to account in 1928.                                                   10, Downing Street, S.W.,My dear Gretton,                                       December 19, 1927.    I have to thank  you for your letter of the  23rd November  enclosing  theResolution passed at a meeting of Conservative Members on the previous evening,urging the necessity  of reducing the  Budget and  avoiding  further  financial commitments both national and local.  I have  communicated its contents to mycolleagues and  they  desire me  to assure you that  the Government are fullyconscious of  the  importance  of  enforcing a  policy  of strict  economy both  asregards the estimates of national expenditure and as regards proposals for further legislation.   They are now reviewing the position for next  year  and they  are determined to give  effect to  this  policy to the utmost extent compatible withthe national interests  in their charge.  My colleagues and I accordingly welcome the Resolution which  you  sent  me as indicating  that they can count on the full support  of  the Party in meeting the opposition which the execution of thispolicy inevitably involves.                                           Yours siucerelv,                                         (Sgd.)     STANLEY  BALDWIN.
