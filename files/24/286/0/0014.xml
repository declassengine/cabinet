THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.S E C RET                                             COPY NO.CP. 117 (39)                           CABINET                     BRITISH AIR TRANSPORT BILL.                Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of .State for Air,     1.         I  circulate  for  the  consideration of  the  Cabinet tho     draft  of a Bill to  give  effect to the  Government&apos;s  proposals     (Cabinet 54  (38)) which  I  announced in the House  of Commons on     11th November  last,  for  the  establishment of a  Public  Corporation     to  acquire and operate the undertakings of Imperial Airways Ltd.     and British  Airways  Ltd.     2e         After protracted negotiations,  agreement  has been     reached with the Boards  of both Companies as to the price  to     be  paid for  the respective undertakings and there is thus  no     need to provide for  compulsory purchase.    I announced the     details in the House- of  Commons on the 12th May.     3o         The  Bill,  which  is a hybrid, provides for the     establishment  and constitution of the  Corporation, facilitates     the transfer of the  undertakings and makes further  provision     for the operation-of air transport services.     4.         The  capital  finance  of the Corporation will  be provided     by  the issue of fixed-interest stock guaranteed as  to  principal     and interest by the-  Treasury.    Grants towards  the  Corporation^     expenditure  on revenue account will be made from Air Votes     and will be  fixed so as  to ensure the  efficient conduct  of the     undertaking, to cover  the  service of the guaranteed stock  and     to  allow of  the accumulation of reserves.   Existing subsidy     agreements with the  Companies  will be  terminated and grants from     Air Votes will,  in future, be  based on programmes and  estimates     of  expenditure and revenue to  be submitted triennially.
                                             K.W.Air Ministry,May .80th, 1939.A maximum will &quot;be set to the grants that may be paid to theCorporation in any financial year!  the precise amount is still under discussion with the Treasury.5*        It is essential that the Bill should become law before the end of the Session.   Imperial Airways and british airways can no longer embark on the development of air servicewithout raising large sums of additional capital and this, inpresent circumstances, they are unable to do.   existing commitments are with difficulty being financed by increasedbank overdrafts and loans, and the Companies are severelyhandicapped in long-range planning and the provision of up-to-date aircraft.6,        Further, the rapid expansion of overseas services,coupled with the great technical advances which have been madecalls urgently for the pooling of the resources of theCompanies and the unification of their administrative and operational arrangements if competition with foreign air-linesis to be met.7.        The Bill has been prepared in close consultationwith the Treasury and other Departments concerned and also with the Chairman of the Companies.   An earlier draft wasconsidered by the Home Affairs Committee of the Cabinet attheir meeting on the 15th May (H.A.G. 11th Conclusions (39)),and the Bill has since been revised in the light of their comments.8.        I should be glad if the Cabinet would approve its early introduction.
