CA3IHET...C.P.109 (39).                 RAILWAY &quot;SQUARE DEAL&quot; PROPOSALS.              Memoranduva &quot;by the Minister of Transport.9             On 15th December, 1938, my predecessor brought to thenotice of the Cabinet (C.P.278(38)) the financial position of theMain Line Railway Companies, which is illustrated by the summarytable appended to this memorandum, and reported that he had referred to the Transport Advisory Council (a statutory body consisting of representatives of the various-interests concerned)the railway proposals for the repeal of the existing statutory control of charges for the conveyance of merchandise traffic by rail.   The Council have now reported (copy attached) and it isimportant that the Government&apos;s intention should be announced withoutdelay.2.            The Council&apos;s recommendations are based on a series of agreements reached between the interested parties and have all the outward appearance of unanimity.   A closer examination, however,reveals certain reservations which are of considerable inroortance,notably -    (i)  the attitude of the trading interests towards the road-rail             agreement (Appendix XX) ,   (ii)  the views of the Scottish Commercial Motor Users&apos;             Association (Para. 50 and Aopendix XVIIl),  (iii)  the position of the coal mining industry  (para. 31  and             Appendix XIV) and   (iv)  the question of the publication of rates  (Para. 33(c)).None the less, the large measure of agreement reached is a notableachievement and presumptive evidence of the soundness of theReport.   Clearly, the Council&apos;s recommendations carmot be rejectedexcept on strong grounds of public policy.3.            The Council (Para, 7 of Report) reaffirm their belief in the co-MMntiinat/iort of transport to avoid unnecessary overlapoing
                                .  o *                                -*  (J -of services and uneconomic competition and emphasise  (Para.16  of report) that their proposals are of a  temporary  nature  only and are intended to cover a period of not  more than 5  years,  during whichthey hope that a reasonable degree of  co-ordination may be  attainedthrought the setting up of a road-rate structure as envisaged intheir earlier Report on &quot;Service and Rates&quot;.   I  shall no doubt be pressed at an early date to say what steps I  entend to  take to ensurethat a system of reasonable and correlated rates is applicable to  all forms of transports  To this question  I should propose  to reply that, with the assistance of the Transport Advisory Council, I shallwatch the developments in that direction which may be expected asa result of the Council&apos;s two Reports  and the  agreements nowrecorded, and take such action as  those developments  may show tobe desirable.4,       The existing statutory control of railway freight chargesis vested in the Railway Rates Tribunal and is described in some detail in Part 2 of the Report.  This  control  was devised when therailways had a virtual monopoly of inland transport and its primary object was that they should -     (i) exercise their powers with due regard to the interests              of the country as a  whole, and    (ii) subject to good management earn an adequate, but not              excessive, net revenue.The system is based on a &quot;Standard Revenue&quot; for  each amalgamatedrailway related to the net revenues in 1913 of the companiescomprising the amalgamated company.  The Tribunal is charged withthe duty of fixing rates at a level which, with efficient and economical working and management, is calculated to yield theStandard Revenue.  Merchandise  traffic is divided into  a largenumber of classes (mainly according to value)  and &quot;StandardCharges&quot; are fixed by the Tribunal for each of these classes.The Railway Companies have, however, discretion to quoteexceptional rates below the standard;  but any rate which ismore than 40 per cent, below the Standard must first be approved
                                                         icoThe&apos;term &quot;existing charges&quot; is not defined in the Report,  but the logical interpretation is &quot;the Charges m force  at the time when the alteration is proposed&quot;.by  the  Tribunal.   When  this  system was  introduced, it was hopedthat  with  this  detailed  classification the great bulk of freight traffic would be handled at the standard charges.           The situation  has been radically altered by thedevelopment of  road  transport.   For this and other reasons, therailway companies have found  it necessary to quote exceptionalrates to such an extent  that  by far the  greater part of thetotal freight tonnage is now  carried at  rates lower than thestandard.   In  fact  there has been considerable departure fromthe principle of classification (or &quot;what the traffic will bear&apos;)and the principle of standard charges has already, in large measure, disappeared.5.        The Council recommend that this system be abandoned and that the railway companies should be entitled to make suchreasonable charges as they  think fit,  subject to the following conditions:-    (i)    no increase may be made in existing charge 3/^except           after compliance with a prescribed procedure which           varies according as the increase is of a general           nature or relates  to an individual charge;   (ii)    the railway companies may (subject to their agreements           with other transport interests) quote charges lower           than existing charges/2&apos;5 an(i  (iii)    any trader may appeal to the Railway Rates Tribunal           as to the reasonableness of any charge affecting him.These conditions are supplemented by further proposals for the safeguarding of trade and industry and of other forms oftransport.    No change is proposed in  the present obligationson the railway companies as to reasonable facilities, throughrates and standard conditions of carriage.Relaxation of existing; control of railway freight charges.6.        The principal recommendations  for relaxation of statutory.control of charges  (Para. 33 of Report) involve the repeal of the existing provisions as to  -          (a) Classification  of Merchandise and Standard Charges.          (b) Exceptional Rates and Agreed Charges.          (c) Adjustment of Charges to produce Standard Revenue.          (d) Equality of Charge and Undue preference.           (e) Disintegration  (i.e. Analysis of exceptional rates                to show how  much is charged for conveyance,                station terminals and service terminals).
           The Council vrere,  howevers  unable to reach agreement on the very important question of the publication of rates and charges and make no recommendation on this  point.   They content themselves (Para 33(c)  of Report) with stating that the  matter is one of major importance and  with setting  out  the conflicting views.   The railway companies feel very  strongly on this  point and will undoubtedly contest any proposal that they should be required to do  more than they have volunteered,  namely,  to make their  charges known on  appropriate commercial lines.           It does  not seem possible to accept the claim  of the railways that in this respect they should be  put on the  same footing as other forms  of transport;,  their very size and ubiquity makes  their position entirely different and they have themselves abandoned this claim in respect  of other matters (e.g.  power to  increase charges)  on which they have reached agreement  with  the  interests  concerned.   I think that the Traders  Co-ordinating Committee  on Transport  are justified in contending that  all  rates and  charges  should  be  readily accessible  to all concerned.    The  more highly organised industries  may be in a  position  to  look after themselves,  but the safeguards proposed in the Report  for trade  and industry willbe of  little or no avail  to small  traders and manufacturers unless they can readily obtain data on which  to  challenge  the reasonableness of any charge  (Para. 37(vi)  of Report).   To carryout the agreed proposals  as to  increases  in charges  the  railwaycompanies must in fact  retain their existing  rate books  forpurposes of record and  comparison;  the information required will therefore, be readily available and the railway  companies&apos;objection  to disclosure of their charges  to road competitorsis hardly  compatible with their agreement to  discuss  chargeswith the road transport interests.          Safeguarding  of Trade and Industry.7.        The proposals for the safeguarding  of  trade and industry are based mainly on  two agreariarts in  generally similar tenns
 reached between the railway companies  on the  one  hand  and  the Traders&apos; Co-ordinating Committee  on Transport  and  the Agricultural interests  on the other.           These. Agreements  (Appendices XI and XIII  to  the  Report) are  the  keystone of the Report. 8.        The  general principles underlying the agreements are:-     (i)   Conferences of  railway and trading  representatives             are to  be set up which will  consider  any proposals             by the  railway  companies for any  general increase             In existing charges;    (ii)   Failing agreement on any such  proposal  at the             appropriate Conference the railway company must give             one month&apos;s notice of  their  intention to bring the             increase  into force  and the  matter will then stand             referred  to a Tribunal for determination;   (iii)   The  railway company must give  one month&apos;s notice of             any proposed  increase  in individual charges when             the traders affected will  have the right to take             them to the appropriate Conference and  to  the             Tribunal;    (iv)   Any  trader (or body of  traders)   shall have the right             to approach the Tribunal to  reduce any  charge  on             the ground that it is  too  high or that  the charges            made to other traders  with whom he is in competition             are low in relation  to those paid by  him;  and     (v)   The  basis of the  Tribunal&apos;s  determination in all             cases shall be  the reasonableness of  the proposed             charge.          No agreement was  reached between the railways and the coal mining  interests, possibly because  of conflicting interestswithin the mining industry  itself.  The  Council,  however, (Para 51 of Report) suggest that their proposals  for the safeguarding of trade  and industry in  general should be satisfactory for the  coal mining industry also.9.        Three  important issues arise from the proposals contained in the agreements  -    (i)  the nature of the  conferences   (ii)   the  onus  of  proof and   (iii)   the  criteria of reasonableness.These matters  are  aiscuss.ee] in the following paragraphs of thisMemorandum.    Whatever machinery may finally  be devised to giveeffect to these  proposals it is clear  that a  heavy  and difficultresponsibility  will be placed on the Tribunal which will haveno general objective  to guide it such  as  is now provided by the&quot;Standard Revenue&quot;*
4 n^i1 y                 Nature of Conferences,,10o       The statutory machinery proposed for the adjustment(up or down) of railway freight charges is set out in detail inParagraph 37 of the report    An inportant distinction is drawn between &quot;any general increase&quot; and &quot;any increase in individualcharges&quot;i  but this distinction may involve some considerabledifficulty in definition,,llo       For any general increase the first step will be for therailway company to bring their proposal before the appropriateConference,   If agreement is reached9 the company will givepublic- notice of the intention to increase the charges *9  thenew charges will then come into operation on the date specified,,It will still be competent to any trader affected to appeal tothe Railway Sates Tribunal on the ground that the proposed charges in so far as they affect him are not reasonable5  the Tribunalwill have power to amend the charges as from the date of their decision or any subsequent dateB   If agreement is not reached at the Conference, the company will give one month1s notice ofthe increase and may bring it into operation after that period,,ivieanwhile9 the proposal will automatically stand referred to theTribunal whose decision,, if not given before the increase has comeinto force will be retrospective and the company must refund anyoverpayments0          In the event of a proposal to increase an individualcharge9 the company will give one month&apos;s notice to the tradersconcerned and may bring the increase into operation after thatperiodo   If the traders do not agree with the proposal they may refer it to the appropriate Conference and afterwards to theTribunal or, if they prefer9 direct to the Tribunal whose decision will be retrospective,,12o       Much will depend on the character and effectiveness ofthe Conferences but paragraph 35 of the Report clearly contemplatesthat they should not be set up by Statute,    This will leave the
position  flexible  and allow the parties to mould the form,procedure and  scope of the various Conferences to meet the needs and peculiarities of the industry or district concerned.   Onthe  other hand the Council recommend that a general increase in charges which  has been agreed at the appropriate Conference orConferences  shall  come into force without further formality andthat in the  event  of disagreement at the Conference the mattershall  stand  referred to the Tribunal.   Any legislation giving effect to these proposals must, therefore, refer to these conferences  and, in my view, must give them such standing thatthe  legality of a charge cannot afterwards be challenged on theground that  the Conference at which it was discussed was not the&quot;appropriate&quot;  one.13 .       I  have also reached the conclusion that this questionof appropriateness must be settled before the Conference reachesa decision and not be left to be raised afterwards.   To thisend  the railway company proposing the increase might be requiredto apply  for a certificate that the Conference or Conferencesbefore which they intend to bring the proposal is &quot;appropriate&quot; forthe  purpose.   The tribunal would not be a suitable body to issuesuch a certificate and this duty would have to be imposed on aGovernment Department, presumably the Board of Trade, or foragricultural traffics, the ministry of Agriculture and the ScottishDepartment of Agriculture.   Such a certificate should not be open to challenge, but should be final and conclusive.                         Qil^i3. of Proof.14.       Where agreement cannot be reached at the appropriateConference on a proposal for a general increase of charges theReport recommends that &quot;the matter shall stand referred to theRailway Rates Tribunal which, after giving both sides anopportunity  of being heard, shall fix such charges as it considersreasonable&quot;.   The object of this suggestion is to avoid any
                                                           lu -Jdefinite onus of proof being placed on either party,  a matter to which &quot;both the railways and the traders attach considerable importance,15.       Where a trader (or body of traders) is unable to agreewith the railway company over an increase in individual charges the Report recommends that the trader &quot;may refer the  matter tothe appropriate Conference and afterwards to the Tribunal or,if he so desires, direct to the Tribunal which shall  fix such charges as it considers reasonable&quot;.   Here again, I  think it willbe desirable to avoid placing the onus of proof on either party,16.       If a trader (or body of traders) challenges an existing charge or a general increase which has been agreed at theappropriate Conference, it seems clear that the onus  of proofwill, rightly, fall on him.   The decision, however,  will stillrest on &quot;reasonableness&quot;.Criteria of reasonableness.17.       The Report (para. 37(vi)) suggests that the Railway rates tribunal should judge the reasonableness of a charge  by, inter alia, the following criteriaa-     (a) whether or not the charge is detrimental to  the public          interest&apos;     (b) variations in the value of currency3     (c) the cost of affording the service or services in respect          of which the charge is made i      (d) the existence of any alternative or competitive transport          facilities for the conveyance of the merchandise in          respect of which the charge is made and the charges made          for the carriage of like merchandise by such alternative          means of transport 5     (e) the effect of the charge on the financial position of          the parties concerned, either generally or individually3     (f) the charge made to other traders for the carriage of          like merchandise if it affects the trader concerned.These tests of reasonableness will form the basis of  the new ratestructure.   In view of the fact that they have been  agreed betweenthe interests concerned it would be difficult to suggest any
material alteration save on the strongest grounds;  and I thinkthat in general, subject to close examination of the drafting, theywill form a workable code and provide a reasonable safeguard against abusea18.       It was suggested during the Council&apos;s proceedings thatthe Tribunal should also be required to have regard to; -       (g) any charges agreed with other forms of transport            with a view to avoiding uneconomic transport            charges; .but the trading interests, including agriculture, dissented fromthis proposal (para. A3 of report it must be recognised thatusers of transport view with suspicion any attempt by its.purveyorsto collaborate (para. 2rj of this Memorandum):, but in my view the overriding interests of co-ordination will best be served by theinclusion of this additional criterion.19.       The agreements between the railway and the trading-interests represent a considerable modification of the originalclaim of the railway companies for complete freedom.   If theagreements are to be carried out in the spirit as well as theletter, then I suggest that the proposals contained in Part 7j ofthe Report as to the relaxation of existing statutory regulations and the safeguarding of trade and industry may be- accepted as a workable scheme to cover the interim period of five yearscontemplated by the Council.   At the same time I must pointout that so great a departure from the hitherto accepted bases of railway charges (including the widely recognised -principleof classification) must involve risks, the full extent &quot;of whichcan only be revealed by the events
                                                           X *j s                            -10- Safe guarding of other forms of transport. 20,          Part 4- of the Report deals with the protection of other forms  of  transport.   Here again the Council&apos;s recommendations are &quot;based  on  a  series of agreements reached between the railways and the other interests concerned. 21.          An essential feature of all these agreements is the proposal  for voluntary consultation on matters of common interest with a view to an amicable settlement of differences.   I entirely agree  with  the Council&apos;s statement (Paragraph 59 of Report) that &quot;the success of the agreements and the extent to which they will advance our ultimate aim of the co-ordination of all forms of transport must depend on the spirit in which they are implemented&quot;. My hope is  that everybody concerned will benefit quite as much from the  development of the spirit of co-operation evidenced by these  agreements as from the adoption of the specific recommendations in the Reoort. Road Haulage Industry. 22.          The most important of these agreements is that between the railways and the road hauliers.   It marks the first real attempt at  collaboration by these two forms of transport and is the most hopeful approach yet made towards a rate structure for the road haulage industry.   Consultation between the two interests is to be  effected by a Central Consultative Committee (with power to appoint Regional Committees) which is to be set up on a voluntary basis  to formulate the principles on which agreements can be made as to  the charges for the carriage of merchandise by road and by rail,    A committee of this nature has already been set up and has started to function under the title of the Road and Rail Central Conference,  but its constitution and competence have been challenged by the Scottish Commercial Motor Users&apos;  Association. 23.          Any agreement as to charges between a railway company or companies and an appropriate body of road hauliers may be
referred to a Tribunal (the Railway Rates  Tribunal  suitablyenlarged) for approval.   Before approving an agreement  theTribunal is to consider any objections by  traders or other roadhauliers.   After an agreement has been approved by the  Tribunalthe agreed rates are to be binding on the  railways  and on allroad hauliers.   Enforcement in the case of road hauliers willbe by way of a condition attached to his carrier1s  licence.It will be a matter of considerable difficulty to secureobservance of such a condition, but we are entitled to expect thegood will of the more responsible hauliers and it should bepossible to obtain a reasonable and increasing degree of compliancDespite the very real difficulties of enforcement I do not  think we should be justified in turning the scheme down on that groundwithout a trial.   There will, however, have to be a materialstrengthening of the staff already engaged on checking abuses(e.g. excessive hours of driving).24.           An integral part of the agreement beti&quot;/een road and rail is an undertaking by the railway companies  that for a periodof two years from their obtaining &quot;freedom&quot; they will not raise objection to applications for carriers&apos; licences of the  followingnature save on the ground that the applicant has failed to complywith the conditions of his licence :-      (a) the renewal, without any alteration, of existing            &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; licences;      (b) the granting to existing hauliers of &quot;A&quot; licences            for additional vehicles;      (c) the granting to existing hauliers of additional &quot;B&quot;            licences for vehicles whose operations for hire or            reward are limited to a radius not exceeding 25 miles.This undertaking entails no  change in the existing law.    its effect on the licensing of road goods vehicles is problematicalas the decisions already given by the Road and Rail Traffic  ActAppeal Tribunal must continue to influence the decisions of  the licensing Authorities.   The wider question of some relaxation of
the present licensing system is  discussed later  in this memorandum,but it may be noted in passing that nowhere  in the Agreement  or inthe Report is there any suggestion that  there should be any interference with the existing right, of  a trader to carry his- ownmerchandise in his own road vehicles under a &quot;C&quot; licence,25.          Appendix 11X to the Report indicates that  the traderslook with considerable suspicion, upon the proposal that rates shouldbe agreed as between read and rail.   In this attitude they  are supported by the representative of the agricultural interests.Their fears that their interests may become  subservient to  thoseof the transport agencies are, perhaps,  natural;  but  if we  areto advance towards co-ordination in transport, it is  inevitable that those engaged in providing it in its various forms  should cometogether.   An efficient transport system cannot exist side  by side with competitive rate-cutting.   On a long view it is  moreimportant to traders that the transport industry should be  placed ona sound and healthy basis than that other industries  shouldcontinue to reap the temporary and illusory benefits  of uneconomiccompetition between the different forms of transport.    It  shouldalso be noted that any increase of railway charges arising  out ofan agreement with other forms of transport must either be  agreed with the traders or be authorised by the Tribunal.Canals.26.          The agreement between the railways and the. canalscontemplates the conclusion of a voluntary agreement  on a widerbasis than that already in existence.   No alteration is suggestedin the present system of control of canal companies as toll-takersbut it is proposed that any legislation arising out of the  Repor*tshould relax the statutory c control of the charges made by s-&quot;tatutorycanal carriers to the same extent as the control over railway freight charges is relaxed.   If this be done, the (Jamcilrecommend that canal users should have a right of appeal  to a tribunal (the Railway Rates Tribunal suitably enlarged)  as  to the
reasonableness of any carriage charges made by statutory canalcarriers.Goastwise Shipping.,27.       The railways have also reached agreement with thecoastwise shipping interests, both liner and tramp.  The agreementwith the coastwise liner interests provides for regular voluntaryconferences to settle questions of mutual interest as regardscharges and for the continuance on a wider basis of the existing arrangements under which voluntary rate agreements have subsistedfor many years.  Coastwise Tramp Shipping presents peculiarproblems; but here again the agreement provides for regular meetings on a voluntary basis to discuss rates and other mattersof mutual interest.  The Council endorse the terms of these agreements and recommend that Section 39 of the Road and rail traffic Act, 1933, which provides against unduljr low or inadequaterates being charged by a railv/ay company vis-a-vis coastalcarriers, should be enlarged to cover all railway rates which arecompetitive with coastal carriers or relate to short hauls to andfrom the seaboard.Docks and Harbours.28.       The Council endorse the agreement reached between therailways and the independent dock and harbour interests.  Thisagreement envisages voluntary machinery for ensuring closer-contact and co-ordination and would replace the existing safeguards for docks and harbours by a provision that any independent dockauthority, which alleges that a railway company is by its rates or otherwise prejudicing that undertaking, should have a rightof appeal to the Railway and Canal Commission.                        Labour Questions.29.       The representatives of Labour on the Council expressedfears that the proposals in the Report for determining thereasonablesess of transport charges might be used in such a way as to fetter the freedom of action of the parties and the properfunctioning of the machinery for dealing with questions of wages
VBBm1.1and conditions of employment.    The Council,  therefore,  recommendthat, when deciding the reasonableness or otherwise of freight charges, the Tribunals should  not  be permitted to call in  question the propriety of any improvement of wages or  conditions  ofemployment..30.       Licensing of road goods vehicles.One major question, though not referred to in the   Report because the Council held it to be outside their terras of   reference, is bound to play an important part in any negotiations   and Parliamentary proceedings based on the  Council&apos;s recommendations,   Quite apart from the question of the &quot;Square Deal&quot;, representations   have been made to my  predecessors by traders as well as road   hauliers that there should be a relaxation of the present   licensing system for road goods vehicles under the Road end Rail   Traffic Act,  193J3.   These representations are likely to be pressed   strongly both in Parliament and in the country if any action is   taken to implement the recommendations of the Report.   31.       The proposals of the British Road Federation &amp; are set   out in Fart III of Appendix XVI and are amplified  in Appendix   XVIIo   Briefly, they are as followss-        (i)  The right to object tn an application for an &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;              carrier&apos;s licence should be restricted to road hauliers,              except where the ground of objection is that the              applicant has been guilty of breaches of the law.   The             &quot;case lav/&quot; resulting from past decisions of the Appeal              Tribunal should be set aside and the Licensing              Authorities, in granting or refusing licences, should              consider only the position of road services without              regard to the views of other forms of transport.       (ii)  There should be freedom to transfer licences provided              there is a bona fide business in existence and not merely              vehicles.      (iii)  Renewal of licences should be automatic provided  the              applicant has observed the l&amp;w*       (iv)  There should be reasonable flexibility in additions to or              deletions from the vehicles shown on a licence.        (v)  The procedure of the licensing authorities should be              altered so as t i avoid an applicant having to disclose              details of his business to objectors, who can then use              that information in competition against him.I?his  Federation  consists of more than 50 associations interested in  roads whether  as manufacturers of road vehicles, hauliers or other  users of road  vehicles, providers of material for road making, or in  any other capacity.
 In oral evidence the Federation&apos;s  representative went even further and suggested that  &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;  licences should he granted to anyone who applied for them provided he  was prepared to observe the statutory provisions  as to fitness  of his vehicles, hours of driving,  and wages  and conditions  of employment.   The Agricultural interests also expressed  this  view in the memorandum  (Appendix XIII) which sets out their agreement with the railway companies. 32.       Host of these representations (some of which involve major questions of policy) have in  one form  or another, been made to my predecessors on many occasions by the Road Transport (Goods) Industry  and. they will doubtless  continue to be pressed.   I cannot advise my colleages  to set  aside the broad  decision of policy embodied  in the Road and  Rail  Traffic Act,  193-3-,  that the road transport industry must be  subject to a considerable measure of control.    The time  for considering relaxation of control will come,  in  my view, when the  industry have shown their readiness to set  their own house in order by evolving machinery for determining and. enforcing practical measures of rate control and for securing  more  general  observance of the law in regard  to hours and maintenance of vehicles.    The intitial steps already taken in that direction have  to some  extent been slowed down by the &quot;Square Deal &quot;  discussions  and I consider that any immediate grant of such concessions  as I might be  able  t ? justify would give the road transport  industry the  less inducement  to press on with thesematters.                   Su ama r.y-an d ^oq^ljxs i on.33.       The  recommendations   in  the Report are based on a series of  agreements  reached  between  the  interested parties and, statedbriefly,  ares-     (i)  that  the present system  of  control .of railway freight           charges should be abandoned^    (ii)  that, subject to  certain safeguards, the railway companies           should be entitled  t i make such  reasonable charges as           they think  fit 5
JL J!- &quot;-&apos;   (iil) that the safeguards for trade and industry should he -         (a) periodic Conferences on a voluntary basis;         (b) no existing railway charges to be increased save by                agreement (by the appropriate Conference in                the case of a general increase or by the traders                concerned in the case of an individual increase)                or by the authority of the Railway Rates Tribunal;         (c) a right of appeal to the Tribunal as to the                reasonableness of any railway charge;     (iv)that the safeguards for other forms of transport should                be -         (a) periodic Conferences on a voluntary basis;         (b) agreement as to rates with the road haulage interests,                subject to the provisions of (iii)(b) above;         (c) certain specific provisions to prevent unfair                competition.I suggest that these proposals should be accepted;  taken with theroad-rail agreement (Appendix VI of Report) they should serve, asthe Council hope, to clear the ground for the erection of a roadrate structure correlated with rail.34.          The origin of the railway companies&apos; claim for &quot;freedom&quot;and a &quot;square deal&quot; was the serious falling off in their net receiptsduring recent years.   They have accepted, for the protection ofother interests, such modifications of their original proposals thatit may well be asked how the present proposals contained in theReport will assist in meeting.that situation.   The railways have,however, entered into the agreements with the trading interests andwith the other transport interests and have supported the proposals in the Report with their eyes open.   It must be assumed, therefore,that they have.satisfied themselves that the advantages  which theywill gain from those agreements will enable them both to introducean element of greater flexibility in their charges and to avoid the damage of cut-throat competition.          Moreover, so far as the proposals secure the establishmentof sounder economic conditions in the transport industry, theymust in the long run inure to the benefit of all sections of thecommunity.
35.       The Council put on one side (as  being outside  the  termsof their Remit) the suggestions made to them for a  relaxation  ofthe licensing system for road goods vehicles.    I do  not thinkthat it will he necessary to refer to this matter whenannouncing the decision on the Report.   As and when  it  becomes necessary, I propose, if my colleagues  concur,  to indicatethat the Government is not in present circumstances prepared toset aside the broad decision of policy  embodied in  the Road and rail Traffic Act, 1953, but that I shall be ready to  discussproposals for the amendment of that Act when the road haulage industry has achieved a greater measure of success  in the task of putting its house in order.36.       Despite the large measure of agreement between thevarious interests, I do not think that  legislation  to give  effectto the recommendations of the Transport Advisory Council will  benon-contentious.   The main principles may be accented  fairlyreadily;  considerable argument will ensue as to the  detailed provisions.   There may, for instance,  be  serious contentionover those matters on which the Council were unable to  reach agreement, (see para. 2 above),37.       The railway companies have throughout submitted thematter as one of urgency;  the Council were invited so  to regard it;  and we shall certainly be pressed to  give effect to theReport as quickly as possible.   The whole question is,  however,so complex - it involves consideration of  a century of  railway and canal legislation - that, even if Parliamentary time wereavailable, I doubt whether it would be possible to  prepare  a Billin time for it to receive proper consideration this Session.None the less it is essential that action should be taken as early as possible and that the necessary legislation should beprepared so as to be ready for introduction at the  commencement                                                               . ...of next Session.
38.1 Jtherefore, ask -(a)  that the necessary authority and directions  he    given for the preparation of a Bill to he    introduced at the commencement of next Session;    and(h)  that I may he authorised to announce at once    that the Government accepts the Report in  &quot;broad    principle and that, while the specific proposals    for changes in the law will require careful    examination and consideration, it is intended to    introduce appropriate legislation as soon  as    possible.(Init.)E.W.Ministry of Transport,-11th May, 1959.

At our  meeting on the 4th April,  1939, we considered andadopted the Report of the Committee, which now follows.4th April, 1939.(Signed) ARTHUR GRIFFITH-BOSCAWEN.                        Chairman.
             REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE.   PART i.-INTRODUCTORY AND PROCEEDINGS.The Remit.  The Remit to the Transport Advisory Council was containedin a letter to the Secretary,  dated  12th  December,  1938,  asfollows:      SIR,      I am directed by the Minister of Transport to state for the    information, of the Transport Advisory Council that he has    been approached by the four Main Line Railway Companies    with a proposal, that the existing statutory regulation of the    charges  for  the  conveyance of  merchandise  traffic  by    railway,  together with the requirements attached thereto,    including such matters  as  classification,  publication and    undue preference, should be repealed.      The nature of the Companies&apos; proposals is  explained in    two memoranda submitted to the Minister by  the Railway    Companies&apos; Association,,  and copies of those  memoranda    are transmitted herewith.  (Appendices I and II.)      The Minister would be glad if the Council would take the    matter into very  early consideration and  report to  him as   - expeditiously  as  possible under  the  following  terms  of    reference:            &quot;  To consider the memoranda which have been sub-        mitted to the Minister  of Transport by  the Railway        Companies&apos; Association in connection with the proposal        of the Main Line Railway Companies that the existing        statutory regulation of the charges for the conveyance        of merchandise traffic by railway, together with the re-        quirements  attached  thereto,  including such matters        as classification, publication  and  undue  preference,        should be  repealed and to  make recommendations.&quot;      In transmitting this matter to the  Council  the Minister    feels that it may be of assistance  to them to learn that, as at    present advised,, he is inclined to the view that in existing    circumstances there is, prima facie, a case for some material    relaxation, of existing statutory  regulations, provided that    due regard is  had  to the  ultimate objective of the co-    ordination of all forms of transport.      The Minister would ask  the  Council,  in framing  their    recommendations, to  consider  particularly  and  advise    him           (a) whether in their opinion the whole of the existing        statutory provisions relating to  the charges for the con-        veyance  of merchandise traffic by rail should be  re-        pealed; or
                             3                             :          (b) whether, while retaining the broad outline of the        existing position, certain provisions should be repealed        or modified;          (c) in  either case, what (if any) safeguards would        be desirable for the protection of other interests.      In the hope that it may assist the Council in their  con-    sideration of  these three points, the Minister has indicated    on the attached document (Appendix III) the main features    of the  existing statutory  provisions  relating to  charges    which, on a preliminary study, would appear to be affected    by the railway companies&apos;  proposals.                              I  am, Sir,,                                  Your obedient Servant,                                (Sgd.) LEONARD BROWETT.  2. In view of the terms of this Remit we have felt  compelledto limit our investigation to questions appertaining to the regula-tion of transport  charges  and the effect which any  proposedalteration would have on trade and industry, which throughoutthis Report includes agriculture, and on transport itself.   Wehave, therefore,  refrained from  including  in this Report any recommendations  on certain  matters relating  to the  general question of co-ordination which have been brought to  our noticeduring our proceedings but which appear to be outside the termsof the Remit; for example:        (i) The suggestion of the road hauliers (Appendices XVI    and XVII) that, if the railway companies obtain substantial    relaxation from the existing statutory  regulations relating    to the carriage of  merchandise by  rail, they also should    obtain a measure  of relaxation by the removal  of certain    disabilities from which they  claim to be suffering, in par-    ticular,  the conditions under which applications for &quot; A  &quot;    and &quot; B &quot; carriers&apos; licences are determined.      (ii) The opinion  strongly  expressed  by the agricultural    interests, as set out in the memorandum by the railway and    agricultural representatives (Appendix XIII), that the Road    and  Rail Traffic Act,  1933,  should be amended  to permit    any  haulier to ply  for hire upon the roads provided  he  is    prepared to observe the statutory provisions affecting safety,    hours and wages, etc., and that the necessary relief in this    respect  should be included in any legislation to give effect    to the proposals for the relaxation of control of railway    freight charges.       (iii) The view of the representatives of labour that the    unification of all forms of transport under  public  control    forms the only ultimate solution of the problem.
f-JPosition of Railway Companies.  3. The financial position of the railways, which has for sometime past been very unsatisfactory, has recently deteriorated tosuch an extent as to give  rise to  acute concern  for  the futurestability of the companies.  4. In the submission of the  railway companies this  gravesituation has arisen mainly as the result of serious loss of mer-chandise traffic to road competition.  They do not suggest thatthere has been any recent marked acceleration of this loss, andcomparison of 1938 earnings with 1937, which may show that all forms of transport have been equally affected by the depressionsince March,  1938,  do not touch  their case.  The loss of mer-chandise traffic by the railways has been, going on for years andthe cumulative effect is now obvious.  5. The railway companies contend that their efforts to retainor recover traffic are largely  frustrated by legal restrictions ontheir freedom  of charging, restrictions from which their principalcompetitors are entirely exempt.  They therefore proposed thecomplete removal of  the  restrictions under which they quoterates and asked to be left at liberty to make their own terms withtheir customers,  as is  the case with road transport, coastwise shipping and  (to  a less extent) canals.  6. The railway companies understand there  is  a fear thatthey are desirous of attacking the existence of the road haulage industry as it functions under to-day&apos;s conditions.   They wishto repudiate this suggestion;  what they are  askirig is only suchfreedom of action  as will,   in their opinion, enable them  to compete for  traffic with  road and  other transport  services  ona fair and  equitable basis.Co-ordination.  7. In their Report on Service and Rates dated  22nd July, 1937, the Council came to the following general conclusions:         (i) that, with a view to avoiding unnecessary overlapping     of services and uneconomic  competition, it  is desirable to     establish as great a  degree of  co-ordination  as possible     among the   various  forms of  transport engaged  in  the     carriage  of  goods, so as to ensure that each form of trans-     port is used to the greatest national advantage;       (ii)  that  the best line of approach to achieve co-ordina-     tion is to aim at securing for  traders adequate alternative     facilities, care  being  taken that the resultant competition     is on fair terms;  and        (iii) that  there should  be  an unfettered  right  on the     part of  the  trader to select the form  of transport  which     he approves and  which is most convenient and  economic     for his purposes.
127It was  there pointed out that  the railways are controlled byan elaborate rate structure; that the canal interests have already in existence a large body of agreed rates covering a great manytraffics  but that in law they are only controlled to a limited extent by  maximum rates  which do  not apply to the trafficconveyed by bye-traders;  and  that  neither coastwise shippingnor road hauliers  are  under any statutory control  as regardsrates.  The Report contained proposals for the creation of ratestructures for road hauliers and  canals.  In their  Report on service  and Rates  (Coastwise Shipping) dated 7th July, 1938,the  Council  referred  to  the measure of rate control which already exists by  agreement within the  coastwise liner trade,where there is little unregulated competition, and recommendedthat the existing  voluntary agreement between  the railwaysand coastwise  liner  companies should  be extended  to and ultimately  embrace road  haulage and  canal  companies;  asregards coastwise tramp shipping the Council stated that a ratestructure was not practicable at present.  These proposals were agreed by all the representatives of the different forms of trans-port on the Council and were  received with general approval.  8. The Report of the Council also  contained a statement ofthe principles on which the Council considered that  a road ratestructure should be built, namely, that it should be the product of  the  industry itself;  that the rates  should be  arrived at inrelation solely to  factors affecting road  transport rather thanby attempting to relate them to rates prevailing in other formsof transport; that the structure should be elastic and,  subject always to provision for consideration of the views  of the tradingcommunity,  should be capable of adjustment by  simple  andquick procedure.   We consider that,  in the circumstances  weenvisage in this Report, these principles should be applied whenrate  structures  for other  forms  of  transport  are  under con-sideration  and that rates should be arrived at in relation solely to  factors affecting the particular form of transport  employed and should not be artificially linked with rates charged by other forms of transport.   9. The  action of the railway companies in urgently  asking for the total abolition of the present system of statutorj&apos; control of  their charges for the carriage of  merchandise appeared  at first sight to be a complete reversal  of the policy previously recommended  by the Council.  The railway companies, how- ever, both in their memoranda to the Minister of Transport and orally at the commencement of our  consideration of the Remit indicated  that they  had no such aim.   They expressed their anxiety to build  up a rate structure free  from the restrictions which  they felt to be onerous and,  in many cases, out-of-date, and stated that they were ready to enter into negotiations with the other forms of transport  with  the object  of arriving  at  a
-* ^ a properly co-ordinated system of charges, and with the trading and industrial interests to  determine  suitable safeguards for the protection of  trade and industry.   They gave it as their opinion that action on these lines would,  in  the end, facilitate co-ordination and stressed their view that  the process of  evolv- ing a  co-ordinated  rate structure as envisaged  in the Report of the Council on Service and Rates, even if initiated at once by legislation, would be too slow to  save  the  railways from serious financial difficulty. Representations, evidence and consultations  between interests.   10.  Having regard to  all these circumstances,  we arranged that, concurrently with our investigation  of  the matter  in the light of the  documents  and evidence submitted to us  (see Appendix  IV), the  railway  representatives  should  enter into discussion with the trading and  other transport interests con- cerned to see what measure of agreement could be reached as to the steps to be taken to meet  the situation.   II.  Arising out of these  discussions  the railway representa- tives on  nth January, 1939,  submitted to  the Council a memo- randum  (Appendix V) in which they  described the  results of their discussions  up to that date and  put forward  proposals which modified the earlier suggestion of the companies for com- plete freedom to the following extent:         (i) They no longer proposed that they should be relieved     of their obligations as to  the  provision  of reasonable     facilities, or as to through rates or standard  conditions of     carriage;       (ii)  Arrangements should be made  for regular periodical     meetings between the various trading associations and the     railway  companies for  the discussion  of  railway  rates and     charges, trade prices and other matters of common interest;     and       (iii) They should be entitled to  make such reasonable     charges as they thought fit with a right  to traders (failing     agreement under the machinery proposed in paragraph (ii)  )     to appeal against the charge made to a  Tribunal, such as     the  Railway  Rates Tribunal, on the question of reason-    ableness.   12. The outcome of these  discussions is  embodied in the fol-lowing documents  which were submitted  to  the  Council and form part of this Report:        Memorandum  by  the  Railway  Companies   and  the    Liaison Committee on  Road  Transport  Rates.   (Appen-    dix VI.)       Memorandum  by the  Railway  and Canal representa-    tives.  (Appendix VII.)
      Memorandum by the Railway and Dock  and Harbour    representatives.   (Appendix VIII.)      Memorandum by the Railway Companies and the Coast-    ing Liner Companies.  (Appendix  IX.)      Memorandum by the Railway Companies and Coastwise    Tramp Shipping.  (Appendix X,)      Memorandum  by  the  Railway  Companies  and  the    Traders&apos; Co-ordinating Committee  on Transport supported    by  the Federation of British Industries and the Mansion    House Association on Transport.   (Appendix XI.)      Memorandum by the Railway Companies and the British    Iron and Steel Federation.   (Appendix XII.)      Memorandum by the Railway and Agricultural repre-    sentatives.  (Appendix XIII.)      Memorandum by the Mining Association of  Great Britain.    (Appendix XIV.)      Memorandum by the Railway representatives on the dis-    cussions with the Coal Industry.  (Appendix  XV.)   13. Among  the other documents  submitted to  the  Council were two from the British Road Federation to which we desire to call  attention,  namely:        Memorandum of Evidence.  (Appendix XVI.)      Statement in relation to the above Memorandum  and the    Agreement between the Railway Companies and the Liaison    Committee.   (Appendix XVII.)but,  as  already stated in paragraph 2, we feel that in view ofthe terms of our Remit we are not in a position to deal withthe sections  of those memoranda which contain proposals forthe amendment of the law affecting the road haulage industry.  We also draw attention to       Memorandum by the Scottish Commercial Motor Users&apos;    Association.   (Appendix XVIII.)      Memorandum by the Traders&apos; Co-ordinating Committee    on Transport.    (Appendix XIX.)A  memorandum, almost identical in terms with that submittedby the  Traders&apos; Co-ordinating Committee, was  also receivedfrom the Mansion House Association on Transport.  We further consider that we should place on record a memo-randum (Appendix XX) submitted by the Traders&apos; Co-ordination -ing Committee  on Transport supported  by the  Federation ofBritish Industries and the Mansion House Association on Trans-port  in relation to  the agreement which has  been  reached between the railway companies  and  the Liaison  Committee.The agricultural interests have also signified to us their agree-ment with the contents of this memorandum.
  14. It will thus be seen that, save as regards the coal miningindustry, a large measure of agreement has been reached betweenthe railway companies and the various bodies with which theyhave been in negotiation.   After consideration of the documentsembodying  these agreements  and  the  other documents  andevidence which have been submitted to us we have  reached theconclusion  that in existing  circumstances a material relaxation of the present statutory control of charges is necessary to assistthe railway companies in overcoming the difficulties which theyclaim to arise from that control  and to establish conditionswhich  in their view and that of the other transport interestswill  provide a favourable  approach to the ultimate objective of co-ordination.The problem.  15. From this conclusion three important questions arise:         (a) What  steps, if any, are necessary to avoid any  pos-     sible prejudice  to the  ultimate objective of the co-ordina-     tion of all forms of transport?       (b) What  relaxations from the existing statutory regula-     tions should be granted?       (c) What safeguards, if any, are required for the protec-     tion of other interests?  16. As regards the  first question the attainment  of co-ordination we have already indicated our belief, which fewcontest, that an ordered system of transport under  appropriate and  correlated systems of  control is  essential in  the interestsof the community as a whole.  At the outset, therefore, we propose and desire to emphasise that any Act that may be passed as  the result of  this report should  be  regarded as  a temporary  measure to  meet anemergency and should be limited in its duration to a period ofnot more than five years  or such shorter period  as may benecessary to establish such a degree of co-ordination  as willavoid  unnecessary  overlapping  of services  and  uneconomiccompetition.  The  representative of the agricultural  interests is unable to associate himself  with this paragraph as drawn.  He finds him-self in  entire accord with the  proposition that the  proposed legislation  should be regarded  as a  temporary measure  and limited  to a period of not more than  five years but he objectsstrongly to the use in a considered  statement of vague  expres-sions such  as &quot; ordered  system  of  transport,&quot;  &quot; correlatedsystems of  control,&quot; &quot; unnecessary overlapping of services,&quot;&quot; uneconomic competition.&quot;  Such expressions are in his viewcapable  of  varied  and  conflicting  interpretation particularlyin view of the fact that the Committee  has not seen fit to include a definition  clause in its Report.
  17. With  regard  to  the  second question the extent of therelaxations we propose later in this Report to examine briefly the origin and purpose of the existing regulations and to makethe more detailed recommendations necessary to give effect toour conclusion that there should be a material relaxation.  18. As to  the third question the protection of other interests the railway companies point out that the whole  system ofcontrol to which they  are  subjected was designed to regulatemonopolistic conditions which have been largely swept away bythe rapid growth of road transport in recent years.   They claim that the extent of the monopoly now possessed by the railways,so far as it can be said to exist at all, is (except in the case of theheavy industries) very limited.  On the  other  hand it is clearthat the roads cannot afford alternative facilities for the wholevolume of goods and mineral traffic (a total of between 260 and300 million  tons) which passes over the railway system every year and we note the statements made in the memorandum setting out the agreement between the railway companies and the british iron and Steel Federation (Appendix XII) and the memorandum from the Mining Association of Great Britain (Appendix XIV)that in the iron and steel industry &quot; not  more than 3 per cent.of their tonnage is  capable of transference to road transport &quot;and that &apos;&apos; The Coal Export Trade is absolutely tied to the rail-ways and 95 per cent,  of the inland trade is also tied &apos;\.    Thecoastwise tramp shipping interests have also drawn our attentionto their view that they are  to a material extent dependent uponthe coal trade and that the throughout cost of  carriage of coalby coastwise shipping is largely controlled by the railway charges to and from the ports.  In all the circumstances, therefore, weconsider that adequate safeguards for the protection of trade andindustry are essential and we have framed our recommendationsaccordingly.  We also propose safeguards for other forms oftransport on the lines of the memoranda which have been sub-mitted to  us as a  result of their negotiations  with the railwayrepresentatives.  PART 2. THE NATURE, ORIGIN AND PURPOSE OF        EXISTING STATUTORY REGULATIONS.General.   19. Under the Railways Act,  1921, the system of control exist-ing up to that time was considerably modified and a new systemof regulating railway charges was introduced on  1st January,1928.  Standard charges for each of the four amalgamated com-panies established by the Act were fixed by the Railway rates tribunal for all classes of merchandise at a level which,  withefficient and economical working and management, was cal-culated (together with other sources  of  revenue) to yield the
 Standard  Revenue.   This Standard  Revenue  was  denned by the Act as an annual net revenue equivalent to the aggregate net revenues in the year 1913 of the  companies comprising the amalgamated company,  together  with  certain specified allow- ances.  The Tribunal was required to review the charges from time to time and to modify them if necessary according to the procedure  laid down in the Act.   By  this means Parliament sought to ensure that the railway companies, who enjoyed at the time of their amalgamation a virtual monopoly of inland trans- port, should (i) subject to good management, earn an adequate but not excessive net revenue;  and (ii)  exercise their powers in the best interests of the country as a whole.  For similar reasons certain obligations and Hmitations imposed- by earlier  general railway legislation were also continued, while the Road and Rail Traffic Act,  1933, which (inter  alia) empowered the railways to make  &quot; agreed &quot; charges gave  to the Railway Rates Tribunal jurisdiction over this new type of charge.   The main features of the existing system of control of  charges and their  purpose  are set  out in  the following paragraphs 20 to 27. Classification and Standard Charges.   20.     The obligation to charge no  more than the  standard charges as    varied from time to time, based  upon a classification of merchandise    and the schedules of  standard charges,  which can  be varied only by    the Railway Rates Tribunal.  [Railways Act, 1921, Sections 28 (1)  (a),    29, 31, 32 and 35.)  Mi   The  standard  charges  are  related to  classifications  of merchandise  for  (a) merchandise train  and (b) passenger train or other similar service which,  together, contain no fewer than66  classes  and groups.  This represents a considerable exten-sion of the principle of classification adopted  as a result of theRailway and Canal Traffic Act,  1888.  The object of this exten-sion was to bring into a co-ordinated system the schedules of class rates as existing  at  that time and the large  number of exceptional rates which in course of time had been adopted to  cover special  commodities at figures intermediate  between the class rate schedules.  It was hoped by this means to diminish the proportion of the total traffic carried  at exceptional ratesand to provide that a much larger  proportion should be  carriedat rates in accordance  with the  new schedules.  The situationwhich  the  system  was  designed to meet  has been radicallyaltered, however,  by  the  development  of  road transport andits object has to some extent been neutralised by the extensivequotation of  exceptional rates and &quot;  agreed &quot;  charges  by therailway companies for  the purpose  of meeting competition fromthat and other sources.
Exceptional Rates and Agreed Charges.  21.      The limitations  on the  making of charges other  than standard    charges:            (a)  The obligation to charge no less than the standard  charges        except so far as authorised by Statute to  do so.   (Railways Act,        1921,  Section 32.)          (b)  The obligation to obtain the prior sanction of the Tribunal        to the granting of new, or the reduction  of existing, exceptional        rates  so as to bring  them more than  40 per cent,  below the        standard rates chargeable.  (Railways Act, 1921,  Sections 37  (1)        and 38  (2) as amended by the Road and,Rail Traffic Act, 1933,        Section  40.)          (c)  The obligation to report to the Minister of Transport  all new,        and  all reductions in  existing, exceptional rates;  and the power        of the Minister to refer to the Tribunal in certain circumstances.        (Railways Act,  1921, Sections 37  (1) and (2), and 38 (2).)          (d)  The limitations upon the powers of the companies to increase        or cancel exceptional rates.  (Railways Act, 1921, Sections 36 and        38 (3) and (4) as amended by the  Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933,        Section  40.)          (e)  The obligation to lodge particulars of &quot; agreed &quot;  charges, to        give notice of applications for approval,  and to obtain the prior        approval of the Tribunal before making the charges; and the provi-        sions governing approval.  (Road and  Rail  Traffic  Act,  1933,        Section  37.)   The railway companies  urge that in the conditions of corn- petition that have prevailed over the past  15 years these limita- tions  and  the  cumbersome  machinery  involved,  which  are applicable to no other form of  transport  (except in so far as the charging powers  of  canal  companies  are confined  within maximum limits), have  so operated as to prevent  them from competing on a fair commercial  basis with their competitors, to the detriment of their financial position. Publication.   22.       (a)  The  obligation to  publish  the classification  of  merchandise,     schedules of standard charges and exceptional rates.   (Railways Act,     1921,  Section 54.)      (b) The obligation to publish particulars of agreed charges. (Road and    Rail Traffic Act, 1933, Section 37 (11).)   These obligations are concomitants  of the present system of control and the  right of  traders under  that system to apply for an adjustment  of charges or  an alteration  in  the classifica- tion,  coupled with  the safeguards  erected by  Parliament  for protecting   the competitive  position of  docks  and  harbours, canals and coastwise  shipping  and the prevention  of  undue preference.   The railway companies contend that as no such
statutory obligations are imposed on road hauliers, the latter are enabled by. this means, and by the publication of  the pro-ceedings  of  the Railway Rates  Tribunal on applications  forsanction of exceptional rates and &quot; agreed &quot; charges, to obtain information  which places the companies at a disadvantage in competition.Standard Revenue.&apos; . 23v     The obligation upon the Railway Rates Tribunal so to adjust charges    as to ensure that the net  revenue of  each company is equal to its    standard revenue, together with allowances for additional capital raised    or provided in respect of further capital, expenditure.  (Railways Act,    1921, Section 59 and first proviso to Section 35.)  This obligation is  the key-stone of the whole system of  ratecontrol as set up under the Railways Act.  It was intended thatit should afford protection to the railway companies and to  the traders alike.  The protection it  was intended to afford to the railways has only once been  effective, and then  only to  a limited extent,namely,  in  1937 when the Railway Rates Tribunal  prescribedan increase of 5 per cent, in charges.   In other years considera-tions of bad trade or transport competition have prevented  theTribunal from fulfilling their statutory obligation.  Nevertheless,the railway companies regard this obligation on the Tribunal as representing  a principle of great  importance and of substantialcontingent value.  The railway  companies  recognise  that the abandonment ofthe present system of rate control  involves also the abandonment of the Standard Revenue protection, and they  have indicated that they would be willing to surrender that protection as part ofan  integral scheme for the establishment of  a new and more flexible  system of rate control such as that which is outlined intheir own proposals, as  modified  and defined  in the agreements which have  subsequently been reached with the interests con-cerned.    They would not, however, be willing to abandon thisprotection for any scheme of a less complete or logical character.  Owing  to the  fact that actual net revenues have never  yet reached  the  Standard Revenue  level, there has not been  any occasion for invoking on behalf of the traders the protection ofthe Standard  Revenue provisions which limit the net revenueswhich the railway companies may earn.Equality of Charge and Undue Preference.  24-    ..     The  obligation to  charge equally under like circumstances (Railway    Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845,  Section  90),  and to refrain from    giving undue preference (Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1854, Section    2;  Railway  and Canal Traffic Act,  1888, Sections 27, 28 and 30);  the
    jurisdiction of the Railway and Canal Commission in connection with    these matters (Regulation of Railways Act, 1873, Section 6; Railway    and  Canal Traffic Act, 1888, Sections 8 and 9; Road and Rail Traffic    Act, 1933, Sections 37 (9) and (10)).  The possibility that they might be  compelled by these obliga-tions to reduce charges widely as a result of  the  reduction of aparticular charge has  proved a serious handicap on the railwaycompanies under the competitive conditions of recent years.   Asroad hauliers  are not under  any  statutory obligation to makethe same charge for similar services or to preserve equality either as  between different traders or different areas the railway com-panies  claim that the conception of  undue preference has been broken down by road transport except in  cases where the  rail-ways are the only  available mode of transport.Disintegration.   25-      The apportionment of standard charges and the obligation to  disintegration-    tegrate exceptional rates (Railways Act,  1921, Sections 30 and 40,     the Fourth Schedule  to the Act and the Schedules of Standard Charges).    The standard charges are composed of fixed rates for (a) con- veyance; (6) station terminals;  and  (c)  service terminals for loading,  unloading,  covering  and uncovering   (except for classes 1-6,  inclusive).  Exceptional rates are quoted as inclusive rates,  but Section 40 of the Act of 1921 makes provision for their apportionment into similar component parts in order that traders,may be able  to see  how much is charged for each service and be in a position to know what rebates they may claim in respect of services  not iendered.    Disputes are determinable by the Railway Rates Tribunal.    The railway companies claim that this is a  burdensome regula- tion which is a handicap on their commercial freedom  since exceptional rates  are not built up on these lines and therefore cannot fairly  be analysed in  this way. Right of Traders to apply to the Tribunal  for  new or reduced      rates or agreed charges.    26.      The right of traders to apply to the Tribunal to fix new, or reduce     existing,  exceptional rates (Railways Act, 1921, Sections yj (3) and  38     (6)) or to  fix  a charge for  the carriage of merchandise where the     trader&apos;s business  is detrimentally affected by an agreed charge made     to  another  trader.  (Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, Section 37 (6)).    The purpose of these provisions is to give  the traders a means of appeal to  the  Railway Rates Tribunal if they consider that the existing charges are not appropriate and if they have been unable to reach agreement with the railway  companies.
1 ** ^*J. d 0                             14Through Rates and Standard Conditions of Carriage.  27.  :..      (a) The obligation with respect to through rates (Railway and Canal    Traffic Act, 1854,  Section 2; Railivay  and  Canal Traffic Act,  18SS,    Section 25; Railways Act, 1921,  Sections 28  (1)  (&amp;) awd 47).      (6) The application of standard  terms and conditions  of carriage,    which can be amended only by the Tribunal  (Railways Act,  1921,    Sections 42 to 45).  As has already been noted in paragraph 11, the railway com-panies do not desire  any change in these provisions.Other Matters&apos;.  28.  It is necessary also to  refer to certain other matters whichmight be affected by an alteration of the  present  system ofcontrol on the lines which we recommend later.  (i) Private Sidings and Special Agreements affecting rates. By the Railways  (Private Sidings) Act, 1904, it was providedthat the reasonable  facilities which the railway companies arerequired to  afford  shall include  reasonable facilities for thejunction of private sidings with railways and reasonable facili-ties for receiving and forwarding traffic  upon and from  suchprivate sidings.  The railway companies  seek no alteration inthis legal obligation but there are instances where  the rates,tolls and charges for traffic  to and from such sidings are regu-lated by special agreements.   Some  of these agreements hadstatutory sanction but the majority rested  on  ordinary contractsbetween the railways and the owners or lessees of the sidings.Provision for the continuance of such charges with the sanction of the Railway  Rates Tribunal was made by Section 34 of theRailways  Act,  1921,  and  considerable anxiety   has  been expressed by owners  of private sidings as to their position inthe event of an  alteration in the present system.of rate control.  (ii)  Group Rates (Railway and Canal Traffic Act,  1888, Sec-tion 29, and Railways Act, 1921, Section 28 (1) (c) ). Railwaycompanies are authorised to group together places in the samedistrict for the purpose of  fixing  uniform  charges,  provided they do not thereby  create an undue preference.  The practicewas widely adopted  and under the Railways Act the railway rates  Tribunal  has  power to determine any  question as to theinstitution  of new, and  the  continuance,  modification, or  can-cancellation of existing  group rates.  (hi)  Railway  Freight Rebates  Scheme  (Local government act, 1929). The  Local  Government Act, 1929, provided forthe relief of the railway companies from three-quarters of thelocal rates payable by them on hereditaments used  wholly for transport purposes and for the  passing on of the relief to  rail-way users by rebates on carriage  charges  on certain prescribedclasses of traffic. The Eleventh Schedule to the Act contains theprovisions governing the disposal  of this relief and requires the
railway companies to pay sums equal to their rate relief into a fund called the Railway Freight Rebates Fund to be adminis-tered by the Railway Clearing House. After payment out of theFund of a sum for administration expenses, the balance isappropriated for the purpose of reimbursing to the companiesthe amount of  rebates allowed by them to the traders.  Thecompanies thus pool their relief and devote it to uniform scales of rebates operative throughout the country.  As  a result  of reductions  in the assessments of the railwaycompanies  and consequential adjustments in respect of over-payments into the Freight Rebates Fund, the Railway FreightRebates Act, 1936, provided for a temporary curtailment of the list of  prescribed  traffics  upon  which freight  rebates  were allowed, the list  being restricted to exported coal, milk  and livestock.  The prescribed traffics and the proportions of theFund to be devoted to the relief of freight charges borne by eachof the groups  of traffic are fixed by the Acts and can only be altered by Parliament, but the companies are required to lodgewith  the Railway  Rates Tribunal a scheme providing for the allowance of rebates calculated to ensure, so far as may be, thedistribution of the Fund in the fixed proportions.  The schemeis reviewed annually  by the Tribunal.   The total sum paid inrebates  on selected  traffics  up  to  30th  September,  1938,amounted to approximately   311 millions.   (iv) Non-Amalgamated Railways (Railways Act,  1921,  Sec-tion 33). The powers of charge of non-amalgamated railwaycompanies( i.e., those other than the four amalgamated com-panies and the light  railway^s) are dealt with by the railway rates Tribunal who  are required to apply to such companies with  or  without  modifications  an appropriate schedule of charges  applicable to  an amalgamated  company.   (v) Light Railways (Light Railways Acts, 1896 and 1912, and railways Act, 1921). The  charges made by a  light railwayare usually fixed  by  reference to the charges of an adjoiningamalgamated railway company by Order made under the aboveActs.   (vi) Working Arrangements  and Agreements, etc.,  betweenRailway  Companies. The   railway companies have  variousworking arrangements and agreements between themselves, such as pooling agreements and running power arrangements, whichhave a statutory basis.  They also have numerous arrangements of a voluntary character dealing with questions such as the common user of wagons, and the exchange of locomotives and carriage stock.   (vii)  Government Traffic  (Railways  (Conveyance of Mails)Act,  1838, Post Office Parcels Act, 1882, Cheap Trains Act,1883, Conveyance of Mails  Act,  1893, etc.). These Acts deal
 with the charges which the railway companies may make for the carriage of mails, stores and personnel of the Crown Services, and other Government traffic.   (viii)  Accounts and Returns (Railway Companies  (Accounts and Returns) Act, iqii, and Railways Act, 1921, Section 77).  Under these provisions  the railway companies  are required to keep their accounts in a prescribed form, and  to compile  and render certain statistical and financial returns to the Minister of Transport.   (ix) Railway Companies Road Powers (Special Acts, 1928).  These Acts authorise the railway companies to operate their own road services and  to enter into working agreements with other road operators;  and to  invest their funds in connection there- with.   (x)  Miscellaneous Provisions as to rates (Railways Act, 1921, Section 55 and Fifth Schedule). Examples of these provisions are charges in connection with the provision  of private sidings and accommodation, the detention of wagons, the weighing of merchandise, the  use of  coal drops  and other miscellaneous services.   (xi) Other Miscellaneous Provisions. A detailed examination of the whole statutory position will doubtless reveal other pro- visions which will be affected by  our proposals. So far as we are aware, however, those we have mentioned above include all the  most important. PART 3.-THE  RELAXATION  OF  EXISTING  STATU-     TORY REGULATIONS AND PROPOSALS FOR THE     PROTECTION OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (INCLUD-     ING AGRICULTURE).Agreements with trading interests.   29. As  will be  seen from the  documents  appended to  thisReport  the  railway  representatives  have  reached  a large measure of agreement with the trading and industrial  interests as to the relaxations to be granted to them and  the steps to betaken for the protection of trade and industry.  The agreementsdiffer in  detail,  but  those  entered into with  the . Traders&apos;Co-ordinating Committee supported by the Federation of BritishIndustries and the Mansion  House Association on  Transport(Appendix XI)  and with the agricultural interests (AppendixXIII)  are identical in their broad outline.  The general prin-ciples on which they are founded are:        (i)  the setting up of conferences to consider proposals by    the railway companies for any general increase of existing    charges ;      (ii) failing  agreement  on  any such  proposal at  the    appropriate conference, the giving of one month&apos;s notice by    the railway  company or  companies concerned  of their
    intention to bring the increase into force and the reference    of the matter to a Tribunal for determination;      (iii) the  giving of notice by the railway companies of    increases in individual charges v/ith a right to the trader    affected to  take them to the appropriate conference and, if    necessary,  to the Tribunal;      (iv) the right of any trader or body of traders to appear    before the Tribunal to challenge any charge or to apply for    reduced charges; and       (v) the basis of the Tribunals determination in all cases    to be the reasonableness of the proposed charge.The agreement with the British Iron and  Steel  Federation(Appendix XII) is  not in such detailed terms but is based onthe same general principles.   30. We have given careful consideration to the whole question in the light of these agreements  and the  other representations which have been submitted to us and have  reached the con-clusion that  the agreements  form a  suitable basis for  the determination  of railway freight charges during  the interim period, not exceeding five years, contemplated by us in  para-graph 16.   We recommend,  therefore,  that effect should begiven to them in the manner indicated in this Part of,our Report.Coal  Mining Industry.   31.  We regret that it has not been found possible for the rail-way  representatives to reach agreement with the  coal miningindustry whose prosperity, especially in the  export  trade, is ofgreat importance to the country.  We have studied the memo-randum submitted  to  us by  the Mining  Association of  GreatBritain (Appendix  XIV) and the report  of  the railway  repre-sentatives  on  that memorandum  (Appendix XV)  and havedecided that we cannot recommend the adoption of the proposals put forward on behalf of the Mining Association.  We are ofthe opinion that the general proposals we make for the protec-tion of trade  and  industry should provide a reasonably sabs-factory measure of protection also for the coal mining industry as regards both its export and its inland  trade.  We hope thatthe discussions, which have so far proved unproductive of agree-ment, may be resumed for  the  purpose of formulating anyspecial machinery  which may be found desirable  to meet theposition of the industry.Relaxation of existing Statutory Regulations.   32. As noted in earlier paragraphs of this Report  the railwaycompanies do not propose any alteration in the following statu-tory provisions relating to the carriage of merchandise:         (a) the obligation to provide reasonable facilities;       (b) the provisions as to through rates; and       (c) the provisions as to standard conditions of carriage.
140                           ,i8  33-  In these circumstances and on the understanding that con-ferences will  be set up on the lines of the agreements whichhave been reached, we recommend that the following alterationsshould be made in  the present statutory  regulations as to the carriage of merchandise by rail (see paragraphs 20 to 28): -   (a) Classification and  Standard Charges. We  recommendthat these provisions  should be repealed.   We note,  however,that in the  document setting  out the  agreement  between therailway companies and the Liaison Committee on  Road Trans-port Rates  (Appendix VI)  the former state  that whilst theyseek to be free of the  statutory requirements in regard to classi-fication they would, of necessity,  retain a voluntary system ofclassification in order to maintain their own  commercial organi-sation  on  a  sound footing.  (b)  Exceptional Rates and Agreed Charges.-We recommendthat these provisions should  be  repealed.  We consider that from the  point  of  view of trade and industry they will  be adequately replaced by the proposed conferences and the recom-mendations we make  later in this  Report  as to the reasonable-ness of charges.  (c) Publication. On this  point, which  we regard as one of major  importance,  the railway representatives  have come to agreement with the National  Farmers Union and the british iron and  Steel Federation, but have failed to do so with the traders&apos;  Co-ordinating  Committee  on  Transport  and  theMansion House Association on Transport.  The railway repre-sentatives intimate that the railway companies are prepared toaccept any obligation with regard  to publication of rates whichis made applicable to all forms  of transport.  On  the otherhand they submit that it is inequitable to continue an obliga-tion which is confined to the  railway  companies  with the soleexception of canal carriage rates where canal  companies act asstatutory  canal carriers.   It is the  intention  of the railway companies to make their charges known on appropriate commercial lines to all interested parties.  In view of the agreements which they have  reached with therailway representatives (providing for full information to be furnished  on request  by the railway companies to the british iron and Steel Federation and to  the National Farmers Unionas to the  charges applicable to the carriage of the traffics inwhich  they  are directly  or indirectly  concerned)   the agricul-tural interests and the iron and steel industry  are  satisfied withthe proposal  of  the  railway  companies  and  do  not ask forfurther publication  of facilities for themselves.  They feel  thatin consequence of the degree  to which they are organised thearrangements contemplated in their  agreements  should meet their needs.
  On the other hand, the Traders&apos; Co-ordinating Committee on transport and the Mansion House Association on Transportdo  not consider  that the  proposal  of  the railway companies would be satisfactory from their  point of view.   In  the  lightof the recommendations  made later in this Report for the pro-tection of traders by giving them a  right of access to the railway rates  Tribunal, they consider it  essential in  the interests  ofunorganised trades and  individual traders that all charges  inforce for  the time being  (including agreed charges) shouldbe  published in such a form  as to be readily accessible  to  allconcerned.  We  have been  unable to resolve this difference  and in thecircumstances are unable to submit a  definite  recommendation on  this point.   (d)  Standard Revenue.- In view of the  recommendations we make in this Report we are of the opinion that the obligationupon the  Railway Rates Tribunal so to adjust charges  as toensure a Standard Revenue will no longer be appropriate andshould be repealed.  (e) Equality of Charge  and Undue Preference. In view ofour recommendations in sub-paragraphs (v) and (vi)  of para-graph 37, we recommend  that the existing statutory provisionsunder this head should be repealed.  (/) Disintegration. We  recommend  that these provisions should be repealed.   (g)  Right  of Traders  to apply to the Tribunal for new or reduced rates or agreed charges. Although the existing statu-tory provisions in this  matter  will no longer be appropriate,we consider  that the right of any trader or body  of traders to appeal to the  Tribunal  to reduce charges should be  retained.  (h)  Through Rates and Standard Conditions of Carriage. No change in these provisions is now proposed (see paragraph11).  (j) Other Matters.- (i)  Private Sidings and Special Agreementsaffecting rates. The railway companies  do not propose  any legislation which  would  affect their private siding agreements with traders  under Section 61 of the Railways Act, 1921.   Inregard to  special  agreements as to rates,  tolls  and charges which are continued under Section 34 of that Act, the railwaycompanies have,  as  far as  these agreements  affect  the ironand steel industry, given an assurance that as far  as practicablethe  relative position between persons  entitled to  these charges and other persons will be maintained, and the iron  and steelindustry have accepted  this  assurance  as satisfactory.   Therailway companies are prepared to extend this assurance  so asto apply to traders generally.
   (ii) Group Rales. We recommend that the present statutory provisions, under which the Railway Rates Tribunal has powerto determine any question as to the institution of new and thecontinuance, modification,  or cancellation  of  existing grouprates, should be repealed.   Apart altogether from the  statutory rights and obligations ofthe railway companies in this matter, experience has shown thatthe system of group rates is  commercially desirable and  theywould not in general propose to alter it.  Developments affecting-regional production  and consumption may make it desirable tomodify  existing groups, or to create new groups.   Any modifica-tion of  this kind will, however, come within the machinery of consultation and  the charges proposed or  made by the railwayswill be subject to challenge as to their reasonableness before theRailway Rates Tribunal.   (iii) Railway Freight Rebates Scheme. The operation of thisscheme  may need review in the light of our recommendations forrelaxing the statutory control  of railway freight charges and ofthe proposals, approved later  in this Report, for the correlationof road and rail freight charges.   If our proposals be accepted,we are  doubtful whether a system of rebates on railway freight charges will remain  the most suitable channel for passing on totrade and  industry  the  benefits of  railway  de-rating; but weunderstand that the  industries immediately affected do not ask that any change should be made.   (iv)   N011-Amalgamated Railways and  (v) Light Railways. :In our view both necessity and justice require that the statutoryconditions governing freight charges on these railways should, sofar as applicable, be  modified to the same extent as those relatingto the main line railway companies.   (vi)  Working  Arrangements and  Agreements, etc., betweenRailway Companies. The proposals made in this Report willnot affect the law relating to these arrangements and agreements,and no  change is proposed.   (vii)  Government  Traffic. No change is proposed.  (viii)  Accounts and Returns. The railway companies do not propose any  alteration  in the present law except in  so  far asmay be consequential on  the recommendations made in thisReport.  (ix) Railway Companies Road  Powers. No  change is  pro-posed.  (x) Miscellaneous  Provisions  as  to  rates. To  secure Auni-formity  with the  other proposals in this Report we recommendthat, in  so far as the railway companies are now entitled to make
a charge for these services, they should be empowered to makereasonable charges, subject to a right of appeal to the railway rates Tribunal under the procedure set out in sub-paragraphs (v)and (vi) of paragraph 37.  (xi) Other  Miscellaneous  Provisions. We recommend  thatsuch other amendments of the  existing law  should be made asmay be consequential upon or incidental to the recommendations contained in this Report.  We have not thought it necessary or,indeed,  practicable to attempt an exhaustive survey; we hope,however, that we have covered those points which are of materialimportance.Protection of Trade and Industry.  34. We note and approve the proposals for regular periodicalmeetings  or  conferences  between the railway companies andtrade and industry  for the purpose  of discussing matters ofcommon interest, including complaints as to freight charges and proposals for increases in charges.  35. The parties do not contemplate, nor do we recommend,that these conferences should be set up by Statute.  The successof the proposal will depend in large  measure on  the spirit inwhich the parties  approach the discussions which  they are designed to foster and we think it better to leave the position asflexible as possible.  This will leave  it open to the parties to adjust the form, procedure and scope of the various &quot;conferencesto  the   needs  and  peculiarities  of  the  industry  or  districtconcerned.  36. With this provision to meet the special circumstances ofparticular industries  (it would  for instance cover the proposalcontained in the agreement between the railway companies andthe  British   Iron and  Steel Federation (Appendix  XII) thatgeneral changes should so far as possible operate from the samedates and over tire same period of time as the periods of stabilisedprices approved by the Import Duties Advisory Committee), weconsider  that the schemes set out in  the memorandum by therailway companies and the  Traders&apos;  Co-ordinating  Committee (Appendix XI) and by the railway and agricultural representa- tives (Appendix XIII)  should, with certain  minor modifications, meet the needs of trade and industry generally.   37. We accordingly recommend that:          (i) If the railway companies propose any general increase     of existing charges and agreement cannot be reached  at the     appropriate conference or  conferences, the companies shall     give formal  notice  of  their intention  so  to increase the     charges and the matter shall stand referred  to the Railway
143 Rates Tribunal which, after  giving both  sides an  oppor- tunity of being heard, shall fix such charges as it considers reasonable.   (ii) In their notice  the railway companies shall  fix an appointed day, not being less than one month after the date of the notice,  on which  they propose that the increased charges shall come into force and, unless  the matter  shall have been  determined by the  Tribunal before that date (in which case the charges as determined by the Tribunal  shall come into force on the appointed day), the charges as pro- posed by the companies may  be brought into force  at any time on or after the appointed day.   (iii) If the railway  companies propose  any increase in individual  charges, they  shall give at least one  monuYs notice to the traders concerned and may bring the increase into force at any time  after the expiration of the notice. If the trader or body of traders concerned are unable to come to agreement with the railway companies, they may refer the matter  to the appropriate  conference and afterwards to the Tribunal or, if they so desire, direct  to the Tribunal which shall fix such charges as it considers reasonable.   (iv) Where any proposal for an increase  falls to be deter- mined by the Tribunal and the  Tribunal  eventually  fixes charges lower than those proposed and put into force by the railway companies, the latter shall immediately^repay to the traders any difference between the charges  levied and those authorised by the  Tribunal.   (v) Any trader  or body of traders shall have the right to approach the Tribunal to reduce charges  on  the  ground either that  the charges or any  of them are too high, or that the charges  made to  other traders with  whom he is in competition are low in relation to those paid by him.  We consider that both these contingencies will be met by giving any trader or body of traders a right  to appear before the Tribunal and to require that body to fix a reasonable charge on the basis of the criteria set out in the sub-paragraph next following.   (vi) In determining whether or not a charge is reason- able the Tribunal shall have regard  (inter alia)  to thefollowing considerations (but  see also  the reference to thisquestion in paragraph 48):         (a) whether or not the  charge is detrimental  to the    public  interest;       (b) variations in the value of currency;       (c) the cost of  affording the  service  or services in    respect of which the charge is made;
           (d)  the existence  of  any alternative or competitive         transport facilities for the conveyance  of  the  mer-         chandise in respect  of which the charge  is made and         the charges made for the carriage of like merchandise         by such alternative  means of transport;           (e) the effect of the charge on the financial position         of  the parties  concerned,  either  generally or  indi-         individually ;           (/) the charge made to other traders for the carriage         of like merchandise&apos; if it affects the trader concerned.Wage adjustments and the Railway Rates Tribunal.  38. In view of the proposal to remove certain restrictions uponthe railway companies and to set up a new procedure for the determination of the reasonableness or otherwise of charges andthe implication that such procedure may be adopted at a later date for road transport, fears have been expressed by the repre-sentatives of labour that this new procedure to  determine the reasonableness or otherwise of the charge might be used in sucha manner as to interfere  with the free and unfettered discretioneither of the parties in wage negotiations or of the Railway StaffNational Tribunal.  We take the view that these fears should  be removed by theinclusion of a provision to the effect that in the event of railwaycosts being increased by the granting of improved remunerationor conditions of employment, which have beemarranged either by mutual agreement or awarded by the Railway Staff NationalTribunal, the Railway Rates Tribunal shall not be permitted tocall in question the propriety of the improved remuneration or conditions of employment so arranged, and the power of theTribunal to determine whether or not a  charge is reasonablemust depend on other grounds (see also paragraph 76).  PART 4.-THE PROTECTION OF OTHER FORMS OF                       TRANSPORT.General.  39. As a  result of the discussions referred to earlier in thisReport (paragraph 10), the railway representatives have reachedgeneral  agreement with  each of the  other  forms of transportconcerned as to the arrangements to be made for their protection.An essential feature of all  these agreements is the proposal for consultation on matters of common interest with a view to an amicable settlement of differences.  We  approve this proposalbut would point out that the success of the agreements and theextent to  which  they  will  advance our  ultimate aim of theco-ordination of all forms of transport must depend on the spiritin which they are implemented.
 The Road Haidage Industry.   40. The  representatives  of  the  road haulage industry have made it clear that while their industry would not wish it to be felt that it occupied a  position of any unfair advantage in competition with  the railway  companies, it  had  to  face the inherent  difficulties of adjusting the relationship  between two systems of  transport where the charges on one side are in many- respects subject to legal control,  while on the other side the only control at the moment is that of economic factors.  Past experi- ence has demonstrated  to  the  road operators the  unfortunate result of unfettered competition in an  industry such as theirs. For this reason, if at a time when their efforts ax&apos;e being directed towards  correcting the  destructive elements  arising from un- fettered internal competition, they were  to be exposed to external competition intensified to the  pitch of  a war  of attrition, they would be gravely apprehensive  as to the ultimate outcome.  It was in a spirit of mutual and genuine endeavour to avoid such a position  that the agreement between the railway companies and the Liaison Committee  on Road Transport Rates has been reached (Appendix VI).   41. Subject to  the  views expressed  by the Traders&apos; Co- ordinating   Committee   on  Transport  (Appendix  XX)  as endorsed by the agricultural interests  and also to the views of the Scottish road transport interests  (Appendix  XVIII), we approve  the  general outline of the agreement  as endorsed and amplified in the  subsequent letters of 16th February appended to it.  We would call attention to the view expressed by the road and rail representatives that its value lies not only in the actual operative clauses,  but  even more in  the  intentions which underlie it.   42. Subject again to the  reservations  at the beginning of the foregoing paragraph, we do not consider that the proposals con- tained in the agreement will prejudice the recommendations made in Part 3 of this Report as  to the relaxation of the existing statutory regulations; and  we note with satisfaction the state- ment by both parties that nothing  should be done to embarrass or postpone the eventual co-ordination of all forms of transport.   43. An integral  part of the agreement is the undertaking bythe railway  companies that,  save in exceptional circumstances,they will  not, during the ensuing two  years  after they have obtained freedom  from rate control, raise objection to applica-tions for carriers&apos; licences under the Road and  Rail Traffic Act,1933, of the following nature:        (a) the renewal,  without  any  alteration,  of  existing    &quot; A &quot; or &quot; B &quot; licences;      (&amp;) the granting to existing hauliers of &quot;A&quot;  licences    for additional vehicles;
14-8       (c) the granting to  existing hauliers of additional &quot; 13 &quot;     licences for vehicles whose operations for hire or reward     are limited to a radius not  exceeding 25 miles. This is not, however, to debar  the railway  companies from giving  to  a  Traffic  Area Licensing  Authority,  on  request, information concerning existing transport facilities which they provide, or from objecting to  an application on the ground that the  applicant has failed to comply  with  the conditions of his licence.  We would point  out that  this  undertaking,  being a  matter which is entirely within the discretion of the railway companies, does not necessitate any change in die existing  law.  44.  It will be noted,  however,  that the Liaison Committee, while acknowledging the value  of this undertaking on the part of the railway companies, expresses the view that its value is diminished by  the effect of past decisions of the Road and Rail Traffic Act Appeal Tribunal, a  view endorsed by the repre- sentatives of the road haulage  and trading interests, including agriculture.  45. The fundamental basis  of the  agreement  lies in  the arrangements to be made between the railway companies and the road haulage interests for consultation on matters  affecting both parties, including the free  discussion  of difficulties and the consideration of  constructive  measures.  To this end a Central Consultative Committee  (with power to appoint Regional Com- mittees) is to be set up for the  purpose, inter alia, of formulating the principles on which voluntary agreements  can be  entered into in regard to the charges to  be made for  the carriage of merchandise traffic by road  and rail, either  generally or in respect of particular commodities or  particular  routes or areas. It  is  intended  that  on  this  basis the  railway  companies (individually or  collectively)  and the associations representing road hauliers will,  in respect  of the carriage by road or rail of all or any particular class or  description of merchandise, enter into agreements  specifying, (i)  the conditions under which  the merchandise is  to be carried,  (ii) the rates or charges to be made  for the  carriage and  for  other services rendered,  and (iii) the places between which these rates and conditions  are to apply.  46. Some  doubt  has  been expressed  whether or  not  the proposal that there shall be agreement as to the charges to be made by  road and  rail implies that the same  charge is to be- made by  both forms of transport for corresponding services.We  have, however, been  assured by both the road and rail representatives that this is not the case and that the correlated system of rates envisaged will  allow different charges to be madefor  each of  the two forms of  transport where such a course isfound to be appropriate.
1  47- We agree with the view expressed by the Liaison Com-mittee that, owing to the large number of operating units in theroad haulage industry, adherence to voluntary agreements can-not be relied upon and that observance of these agreements mustbe legally enforceable.  To this end  we recommend that any legislation which may be passed relaxing  the present statutory control  of charges for the conveyance of merchandise  by railshould include provisions on the lines of those set  out in theappendix to the memorandum  submitted  by the railway com-panies and the  Liaison Committee (Appendix VI), subject tothe following modifications:  -      (i) We  consider that the procedure for the approval of     agreements as proposed in. Clause  (i)  of the Appendix     might be  simplified by restricting the  action of the Minister     of Transport to  a preliminary certificate that the agreement     has been made between one or more railway companies and     a body or bodies adequately representative of road  carriers     engaged on the  carriage by road of merchandise to which     the agreement relates.      In  this  connection,  however,  we  record  the view     expressed by the representative of agricultural interests that     the  Minister should not give such a certificate unless he is     satisfied  that the body or  bodies which  have made the     agreement have received a mandate, expressed by a poll of     &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B  &quot; licence holders affected, authorising them     to present the agreement for the  approval of^the Tribunal.      (ii) Clause (4) provides for publication of applications for     the approval of  agreements and we consider that provision     should also  be  made  for adequate publicity being given     to agreements after they have been approved.      (hi) If, as proposed in Clause (3) (i), the Railway Rates    Tribunal, when  considering road-rail agreements, is to be    enlarged  by an additional permanent member experienced    in the transport  of goods by road, it should be increased to    a total of five  permanent  members  by the addition of    another member experienced in commercial affairs.      (iv) In regard to Clause  (3)  (ii),  we see no reason for    further increasing the membership of the Tribunal  for the    consideration of these agreements but it would be desirable    to constitute a Road Panel  on the same lines and  for the    same purposes as the Railway Panel under Section 24 of    the Railways Act, 1921.      (v) Although it does not form part  of the proposed legis-    lation, we think  that, in order to accord with the procedure    which the railway  companies now propose in relation to    traders generally, provision should be made  for consulta-    tion with traders before these agreements are finally settled    and referred to the Tribunal for approval.
143                            2?  48. As a result of the agreement between the  railway com-panies and the Liaison Committee (Appendix VI) it has been proposed that the  Railway Rates Tribunal, when determining the reasonableness  of any charge,  should in addition to  the criteria set out in  sub-paragraph (vi)  of paragraph 37 haveregard also to any charges agreed with other forms of trans-port (including those approved by the proposed Road and Rail-way Rates Tribunal) with a view  to avoiding uneconomic trans-port charges.  The representatives  of  the  trading interests,including agriculture, dissent from this proposal.  49. It has  been agreed between the  parties concerned  that,if, during the conferences between the  rail and  road interests,a  particular  question  seems likely  to  affect the  agreements between the  railway companies and  other forms of transport,the interest concerned  will be  kept fully informed so that thespirit of those agreements may be maintained without difficulty.As the situation develops towards  a system of controlled charges,it may be desirable to consider some more general  machineryof liaison  than at  present exists  between the various forms oftransport.  It was  also  agreed that  it  shall  be open  to  any form of transport  to put forward proposals to  this end whenthey consider the appropriate  moment has been reached.  50. The  Scottish  representative  of  users of  rnechanically-propelled vehicles  desired the  inclusion  of the following state-ment as to the views of the road haulage industry in Scotland:         &quot; The users of  commercial motor vehicles in  Scotland     appreciate what has been  done in England by the Liaison     Committee to  promote agreement  between  rail and road;     but for the following reasons applicable to Scotland:             (i) the greater unity  in the road haulage industry;        and           (ii) the somewhat different procedure for regulating        transport  wages both  in previous and present legisla-        tion;     they feel compelled  to respect the memorandum submitted     by the  Scottish  Commercial  Motor  Users&apos;  Association     (Appendix XVIII)  and the oral evidence  given  on their     behalf which deals  more completely with the issue before     the Transport Advisory Council,  and in their opinion offers     the only satisfactory alternative  to  the railway proposals.       &quot; They state that, while  there may be  relatively little     difference  between  the  memorandum submitted  by the     Scottish  Commercial Motor Users&apos; Association  and the     agreement reached between the railway companies and the     Liaison Committee  (Appendix VI), they regard as funda-     mental the Scottish provision which would apply compul-     sion as against pious hope of agreement.
      &quot; In their view the path to co-ordination of rates  has    been made difficult by the alleged restricted powers which    railways now possess, and road rates have been prejudiced.    This will  be  accentuated and co-ordination retarded if    greater railway freedom is anticipated.      &quot; It appears to the users of commercial motor vehicles    in Scotland to be  their duty to advise the  Minister  that    any projected legislation should be designed  to assist both    services to overcome disabilities in charging and not merely    to afford  relief to  one.   They feel bound to support the    considered alternative plan so ably expressed and supported    by the Scottish Commercial Motor Users&apos; Association  and    do so  in  the firm  belief  that it would afford the railway    companies access to the desired relief under legislation suffi-    ciently comprehensive to  protect all interests for an agreed    transitionary period.&quot;Canals.  51. The  actual conveyance of traffic on canals is in a fewinstances undertaken by  the  canal companies themselves, butthis work  is  more usually performed by non-statutory  com-panies or individuals, known as bye-traders.  In addition manytraders  carry  their own goods over the  canals,  and, like thebye-traders, pay tolls to tne canal companies for  the use of the waterways.  52. As an outcome of  the  Railway  and Canal Traffic Act,1888, maximum tolls and wharfage charges were fixed by the canal Tolls and Charges Order Confirmation Acts, 1893  and1894, for the  use  of canals  by  bye-traders  and others,  and maximum  rates and station  and  service  terminals  were  alsofixed by the Orders in the case of those canal  companies whichacted as  carriers at that  time.  The provisions of the  generalRailway  and  Canal Traffic Acts  with  regard  to  undue prefer-ence,  obligation to  provide reasonable  facilities  (includingthrough traffic facilities), through rates and charges and publica-tion apply to  canal companies.   The charges made  by bye-traders to their customers are not regulated by Statute.  53. The maximum tolls are in respect of the use of the canalby bye-traders and others conveying merchandise over it.   Themaximum rates are the maximum rates which the canal companymay charge for  the conveyance by them of merchandise overthe  canal, and  include the provision of boats and towage or othermotive power  by the company, and every other expense inci-dental to such conveyance  not otherwise provided for in theSchedule to the Orders.   The maximum tolls and the maximumconveyance rates were related to a  classification similar to  thatenacted by the corresponding Orders in respect of railways which resulted from  the Act of 1888; but (as in the case of railways
at that time) no standard conditions of carriage were laid downnor were any restrictions imposed on the liberty of canal com-panies to grant reduced tolls or rates.  Subject to the maximumlimits prescribed by their Orders of  1893 and 1894 and to thegeneral prohibition against  undue preference,  the canal com-panies had freedom to make such charges as they thought fit ;but power was given to  the Board of Trade to determine the reasonableness of certain charges made by the companies as wellas to amend the classification by the addition of other articles.The Board were also entrusted with  authority to endeavour tosettle amicably any complaint from any person who consideredthat a  canal company was charging him an  unfair or an un-reasonable rate of charge or  was in any otherrespect treating him in an  oppressive or unreasonable manner.  The powers of theBoard in these respects passed to the Minister of Transport afterthe  War  and are now exercisable by him.    In  addition, theRailway and Canal Commissioners were empowered under theAct of 1888  to  determine  disputes  with  respect  to  terminalcharges, where such charges had not been fixed by Parliament,and to decide  what is a reasonable sum to be paid to any com-pany for  loading and unloading, covering,  collection,  deliveryand other services of a like nature.  The  Commissioners arealso empowered to enforce  any  Orders which they make  for athrough rate or toll and to make Orders requiring the disintegrate-tion of tolls and rates.   54.  In the  interval since  the  War, however, the majority of the important canal undertakings  have obtained special Acts increasing the powers of charge prescribed by their Orders of 1893  and 1894; and Parliament when granting  the  increased powers has usually conferred power on the Minister of Transport, after reference to an Advisory  Committee, to revise the  maxi- mum  charges on the application of the canal companies or of canal users or representative bodies of traders.   55.  So far as we are aware there are now only four  statutory canal  carriers (i.e., canal companies that own canals  and alsoconvey traffic on behalf of traders), namely:         Aire and Calder Navigation.       Bridgewater Canal (Manchester  Ship Canal).       Glamorganshire Canal.       Trent Navigation. We understand, however, that certain other canal companies are interested in companies which act as bye-traders and the charges of which, as such,  are under no  statutory control.   56. The statutory rates chargeable by these four companies for merchandise conveyed  by them, as well  as the tolls  which they may levy on merchandise conveyed  by bye-traders and others, have  been increased by special Acts passed  since the
151 War; and the Minister of Transport has power to revise not only the maximum rates but also the maximum tolls, except in the case of the Bridgewater Canal, in respect of which there is no such provision as to revision.   In the case of the Trent Naviga- tion, the maximum conveyance rates and station  and service terminals were fixed at 10  per cent, below the standard charges prescribed  under the  Railways Act, 1921, for the  London, Midland and Scottish Railway.&quot;   57. It should also be observed that provision is made by the general Acts for controlling the special position of railway-owned canals and for regulating  the  relations  between railway com- panies and canal companies.   58. The canal interests do not consider that  any alteration is necessary in the present system of regulation of canal companies in their capacity as toll-takers;  but they are of  opinion that any relief from rate control accorded to the railways should be extended io far  as appropriate to canal  companies when they are operating as statutory carriers of merchandise on canals.    59. We have  noted and approve the general  terms of the memorandum  which has been submitted to us by the railway and canal  representatives  (Appendix VII).   That document contemplates the conclusion between the two interests of a further voluntary agreement on a  wider basis than that of their existing agreement  and  supports  the  view  of  the  canal  interests  as recorded in the preceding  paragraph.  We accordingly recom- mend that if  the  requirements with regard  to classification, standard charges, publication, undue preference and disintegrate- tion of charges be repealed or amended in relation to the carriage of merchandise traffic  by  railway, a corresponding relaxation should be  allowed  in  connection with the charges made by statutory canal carriers.    60. In the event of such relaxation being granted, we consider that it would be appropriate for the protection of canal users to invest the Railway Rates Tribunal with power to determine the reasonableness of any  charge made by statutory canal carriers for or in conection with the carriage of merchandise. This  would entail alterations in the present law under which questions as to the amount and reasonableness  of canal charges ar,e sometimes under the  jurisdiction  of the Minister of Transport and some- times are  determinable by the Railway and  Canal Commis-sioners.  When the Railway Rates Tribunal is  considering any application under this paragraph it should be enlarged to five members by the addition of a member experienced in the trans-port of goods by canal and another member experienced in commercial affairs.  61. We do not recommend any alteration in the provisions ofthe Railway and Canal  Traffic Act, 1888*, as to the  publication
151                            30War; and the Minister of Transport has power to revise not onlythe maximum rates but also the maximum tolls,  except in thecase of the Bridgewater Canal, in respect of which there is nosuch provision as to revision.   In the case of the Trent Naviga-tion, the maximum conveyance rates  and station and serviceterminals were fixed at 10 per cent,  below the standard chargesprescribed  under the  Railways Act,  1921,  for  the London,Midland and Scottish Railway.  57. It should also be observed that provision is made by thegeneral Acts for controlling the special position of railway-ownedcanals and for regulating the relations between  railway  com-panies and canal companies.  58. The canal  interests  do not consider that any alteration isnecessary in the present system of regulation of canal companies in their capacity as toll-takers;  but they are of opinion that anyrelief from rate  control accorded  to  the railways  should beextended  So far as appropriate to canal companies  when theyare operating as statutory carriers of merchandise on canals.   59. We have  noted and approve  the general terms  of  thememorandum which  has  been submitted to us by the railway and canal representatives (Appendix VII).    That documentcontemplates the conclusion between the two interests of a furthervoluntary agreement on a wider basis than that of their existing agreement  and  supports  the  view of  the  canal  interests  as recorded  in the preceding paragraph.  We accordingly recom- mend that if  the  requirements  with regard  to classification, standard  charges, publication, undue preference and disintegrate- tion of charges be repealed or amended in relation to the carriage of merchandise  traffic by railway,  a corresponding relaxation should be  allowed  in connection  with the charges made  by statutory canal carriers.   60. In the event of such relaxation being granted, we consider that it would be appropriate for the protection of canal users to invest the Railway Rates Tribunal with power to determine  the reasonableness of any charge  made by statutory canal carriers for or in  conection with the carriage of merchandise. This would entail alterations in the present law under which questions as to the amount and reasonableness of  canal charges ar,e sometimes under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Transport and  some-times are determinable by the Railway  and Canal Commis-sioners.  When the Railway Rates Tribunal is considering any application under this paragraph it should be  enlarged to five members by the addition of a member experienced in the trans-port of goods  by canal and  another member experienced  in commercial affairs.   61. We do not recommend any alteration in the provisions ofthe Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1888&apos;, as to the publication
                              3i by canal companies of notice of intention to increase tolls or charges; but we consider that the present obligations as to publi- cation of carriage charges, imposed on them by that Act and the Regulation of Railways Act,  1873, should be amended as may be necessary to accord with the future position as to the publica- tion of railway freight charges (see paragraph 33 (c) ). Coastwise Shipping.   62.  The  coastwise shipping interests  have expressed  serious concern as to their position in the event  of a material relaxation in the present control of railway freight charges.  The Report of the Council on Service and Rates dated  22nd July, 1937, refers to the importance of the coastwise shipping industry, from both the trading and national points of view and to the need which tiierefore exists of avoiding action which might be detrimental to its interests. We recognise  that the position of coastwise shipping in relation to the proposals of the  railway companies now under consideration presents peculiar and special difficulties, and we welcome the discussions which have taken  place  between the interests concerned to formulate proposals for safeguarding the interests of coastwise shipping.   63.  The  results  of these  discussions are embodied in  two memoranda (Appendices IX  and  X); the first deals with coast- wise liner  shipping, the second with  coastwise tramp  shipping. In these memoranda all three parties signify their adherence to the recommendations contained in the Report of the Council on Service  and Rates which  are designed to achieve as great  a degree of co-ordination as possible among all forms of transport ; but in  other respects we  think it will be more convenient to consider separately the circumstances of  the two forms of coast- wise shipping and the proposals to safeguard their interests. Coastwise Liner Shipping.   64. Coastwise liner shipping is not  subject  to  a  statutory system  of rate control, but there is effective rate control within the industry itself in which the amount of unregulated competi- tion is negligible.  The relations between the railway companies and the coastwise liner companies are  governed by voluntary rate agreements which have subsisted for many years and under which comprehensive schedules of rates have been evolved.   65.  In the  memorandum (Appendix  IX)  the  railway  com-panies and the coastwise liner companies record the - agreement reached between them for  the continuance on a wider basis ofthe existing arrangements.  The new agreement will continue toprovide  for  the holding of  regular  conferences to  settle all questions of mutual interest as regards charges,  and will have as its main object, as heretofore, the promotion of co-operation
1 ^ 3and co-ordination between the parties.  It will provide for thefinal determination of any differences which may arise betweenthe parties by reference to arbitration, and will cover the interim period contemplated in paragraph 16 of this Report. It is statedin the memorandum that aluiough it is not practicable at thisstage to embrace  road  hauliers in the  voluntary  agreementbetween the railway  companies and the coastwise liner com-panies,  both parties to the agreement desire that it should ulti-mately,  embrace road hauliers and canal companies.   Theseproposals accord with the view expressed in the Report of theCouncil  on Service  and Rates  (Coastwise Shipping) dated7th July, 1938, and we  do not think it necessary,  at tiiis stage,to do more than record our general approval of the proposalsfor safeguarding the interests of coastwise liner shipping as setout in the memorandum and our view that no legislative action should be required to give effect to them.  66. We note that in  the memorandum (Appendix IX) thecoastwise liner companies support the proposals contained in thememorandum submitted by the  railway companies and theLiaison  Committee on  Road Transport Rates (Appendix VI).The  coastwise liner  companies urged,  however, that as  theCentral Consultative Committee to be set up by the railwaycompanies and  the road transport interests will  of necessity,from the outset of their deliberations,  be obliged to considerprinciples  of  fundamental  importance  to the coastwise linertrade, the  Committee  should  include  representatives  of that trade, not only for the purpose of safeguarding its  interests, butalso for ensuring the maximum early progress in  the directionof general co-ordination.  We appreciated the force of this sub-mission, but felt that to  have given direct representation to other forms of transport on this Committee might have unduly compli-cated the new consultative machinery between the  rail and road transport interests in  the, early stages of its operation.  Further-more, we  would draw  attention  to  the  understanding subse-quently arrived at  and  recorded in paragraph  49; in our view this should enable the closest contact to be maintained between all forms of transport  pending the setting  up of some more general machinery.  The coastwise liner shipping interests concur in this view.   67. The  agreement between the railway companies and thecoastwise liner companies contains no proposal as to the futureof Section 39 of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, in which parliament continued and amplified previous provisions againstunduly low or  inadequate  rates being  charged by  a railwaycompany vis-a-vis coastal carriers.  Relaxation from rate control on the railways would make the provisions of that Section, in itspresent form,  inapplicable and as a result of our discussions weconsider that, in keeping with the agreement reached  between
the railway companies and coastwise tramp shipping, new pro-visions modelled on the lines of Section.39 of the Act of 1933should apply also to the coastwise liner trade (see paragraph 70).Coastwise Tramp Shipping.-  68. This form of transport differs fundamentally from other forms of internal transport, including coastwise liner shipping.It does not in practice charge through rates for its services; it isinseparably bound up  with railways for collection and delivery of cargo;  and it is exposed to foreign competition.  As is statedin the  Report of the Council on Service and Rates (coastwise shipping),  dated 7th  July,  1938,  the application  of  a ratestructure  to coastwise  tramp  shipping would prejudice  its ser-vice to the mercantile community and  to the  nation, and it is impracticable to apply a rate structure to the coastwise tramptrade at  present.  On the other hand,  it is. also stated  in that report that coasting  tramp owners  are anxious to  join  in measures of  co-operation with other forms of transport so faras this is possible.  69. In  their agreement with the railway companies (Appen-dix X),  which  we  welcome  and endorse,  the coastwise trampinterests  give evidence of their desire to participate in a  schemeof  co-ordination, and  we note that they have been  greatly influenced by the assurance given to them by the railway com-panies which appears in the agreement that it is not the intentionof the  latter &quot; to use any relief from their existing rates control to embark upon a policy of cut-throat competition with  coastal shipping.&quot;   The agreement is also founded  on other  recom-mendations contained  in this Report, such as the proposal thatall  railway charges shall be reasonable, with a right to  tradersto challenge  the reasonableness of any  charge before the Rail-way Rates Tribunal on the basis of the criteria  set out  in sub-paragraph (vi)  of paragraph 37, and the retention of the rightof a trader to appeal to the Tribunal to reduce charges.  70. The agreement contains a definite proposal that any legis-lation  which may arise out of this Report should contain pro-visions modelled on the lines of Section  39 of the Road and rail traffic Act,  1933,  &quot; enlarged  to cover any  or all rates and charges which are  being made or charged by the Railways in competition with coastal carriers, or in  respect of &apos; short hauls &apos;to and from the seaboard.&quot;   We endorse this proposal  and, as stated in paragraph 67, recommend that  it should be  appliedalso to coastwise liner shipping.  71.  In  the memorandum of agreement the representatives ofcoastwise tramp shipping mention certain limitations which are inherent in statutory safeguards of this  nature and certain diffi-culties which are likely to arise in their application.  We recog-nise those limitations and difficulties, but are hopeful that they
will be largely, if not entirely, overcome by the further proposals in the agreement as to the setting up of conference arrangements between the railway companies  and coastwise tramp shipping at which the former  will be prepared  to supply  all relevant information to enable complaints as to charges to be considered.Docks and Harbours.  72. Statutory provisions for safeguarding the competitive posi-tion  of non-railway owned docks have been made by Parlia-ment in:        (i) Railway and  Canal Traffic Act, 1888  (Section  30),     which provides that any port or harbour authority or dock     company which shall have reason  to believe that any rail-     way company is by its rates or otherwise placing their port,     harbour  or  dock at an undue disadvantage  as compared     with any other port, harbour  or  dock  to  or from which     traffic is or may be carried by  means of the  lines of that     railway company, either alone or in conjunction with those     of other railway  companies, may  make  complaint thereof     to the Railway arid Canal  Commissioners  who shall  hear     and  determine  the complaint;      (ii) Road and Rail Traffic Act,  1933  (Section 37 (10) ),     which gives  similar  protection  to dock  and harbour com-     panies in the case  of agreed charges made by a railway     company ;      (iii) Railways Act, 1921  (Section 78), which enacts that,     where under the Act an  application may  be made by a     representative body of traders, the application may be made     by  (among others) any harbour board; and      (iv) Railways Act, 1921  (Sections 58 (4)  and 59  (6) )     which contain  provisions  in  regard to  the  adequacy of     charges in respect of the ancillary  undertakings of the rail-     way companies, including docks.   73. The railway representatives  agree that if the existing&apos; control  of railway  freight charges is to be  relaxed it will be necessary to provide other  safeguards in place of those men- tioned above.  The matter has been discussed between the two parties and the agreement which they have reached is embodied in a  memorandum which they have submitted (Appendix VIII).They recommend that any  independent dock authority whichalleges that a railway company is by its rates or otherwise pre-judicing the  undertaking of that  authority should have the rightto make complaint to the Railway and Canal Commission whichshould have  power to hear and determine the complaint andto give such  relief as it  may think proper.  74. The parties also  agree  to set up voluntary machinerywith  the object of  ensuring closer  contact and  co-ordination
24th March, 1939.between the  independent dock undertakings and the railwaycompanies by which  means  the efficiency  of the  transport system as a whole will benefit.  75. We approve the terms of the agreement and recommendthat, in the  event of the present statutory control of railway freight  charges  being relaxed,  the  independent dock under-takings should be given a right, on the grounds stated in thememorandum, of  making complaint to  the Railwa3&apos; and canal commission  which should be required  to  hear and determine the  complaint and give  such relief as  it may  think  proper.Wage adjustments and the Rates  Tribunals.  76. As noted in paragraph 38, the representatives of Labourhave expressed fears that the proposals contained in this report may have repercussions  on the  machinery  for dealing  with questions of wages and conditions of service.   In paragraph 38we  recommend that those  fears  should  be  removed by theinclusion of  a provision to the  effect that in  considering the reasonableness of  railway freight charges  the  Railway rates tribunal should  not  be permitted  to call in question the propriety of any improvement of wages or conditions of employ-ment.   We also recommend that  in the case of the  proposedRoad and Railway  Rates Tribunal a corresponding  provision should be made in respect of the wages and  conditions  of serviceof both  road and railway  employees  when that Trftmnal is considering road-rail agreements.  A like provision should also apply to the augmented Railway Rates Tribunal in respectof canal employees  when it is considering the  reasonablenessof canal charges.Conclusion.  77. Mr. F.  Gordon Tucker, whose services in  connection with previous Inquiries have been of great assistance to the Council,was unable to act as our Secretary during the greater part ofthis  Inquiry  owing to absence abroad  in  connection with hisother departmental duties.  In his place  Mr. G.  F.  Stedmanhas  acted as  our Secretary and we desire to put on record our high appreciation  of the  very  able  manner  in which he hascarried out his duties.  We also wish to thank Mr. D. Dickson,whose knowledge of the Statutes governing transport  rates and charges and of the many technical points involved in the Inquirylias  been of  great assistance to  us.   We  desire also  to thankMr.  H. W. Spiro who has  carried out his duties of  assistant secretary to  our satisfaction.

                             APPENDIX I. MEMORANDUM SUBMITTED TO THE MINISTER  OF TRANSPORT BY THE RAILWAY            COMPANIES ASSOCIATION ON 23RD  NOVEMBER, 1938.              RAILWAY CHARGES  FOR MERCHANDISE TRAFFIC.   1. During the last  fifteen years the Main Line  Railway Companies have made various representations to the Government upon the legal disabilities under which they are operating in comparison with motor transport on the public roads.  At no time have  the railways asked  for  preferential treat- ment; they have merely asked that they should be given equal treatment with the road transport industry  at the hands of Parliament.   2. Legislation has eased some of the disabilities of the railways; but it has not touched the great differences between the  Parliamentary control of the charges and conditions applicable to the conveyance of merchandise by the railways and the road hauliers respectively.   3. The most recent representations of the Railway  Companies were made to the  Minister of Transport  on  24th May, 1938,   when  amongst other matters his attention was again drawn to the injury caused  to the railways by  the  present one-sided control of charges for merchandise traffic.  It is upon this aspect that the  Companies  once more urgently request to  be heard.   4. In 1933 Parliament authorised the creation of the Transport Advisory Council,  and in  1935  a Committee of the Council  was set up to investigate the subject  of  &quot; Service and Rates.&quot;  Their report  was submitted to the Minister in July, 1937, and recommended certain steps towards  the creation of a system  of rates for the road haulage industry.   No steps, however, have yet been taken by Parliament to implement this report.   5.  Since July,  1937, the situation has become seriously worse and mean- while extensive  propaganda has  completely  misrepresented the railway position.   6.  The effects of the unbalanced legal position are steadily accumulating, and the Railway Companies have now  no alternative  but to ask for early legislative steps  to give  them equality with other  forms of  transport. Partial remedies on the  lines of those  suggested in  July,  1937,  even if enacted in the present Parliamentary Session, would not become effective for  a considerable  period, and even when  effective  would not  achieve equality of working conditions.                      Railway Companies&apos; Proposals.   7.  The Railway Companies accordingly submit that:       (a) The existing statutory  regulation of the charges for the convey-     ance of  merchandise traffic by railway, together with the requirements     attached thereto, including such matters as  classification, publication     and  undue preference, should be repealed.       (b) The railways,  exactly  like other forms of  transport, should  be     permitted to decide the  charges and conditions for the conveyance of     merchandise which they are  required to  carry.   8. Equality of  conditions  between all the  various  forms of transporthaving thus been achieved, it would  be proper that any regulation whichmay  in future be applied  to  any  one form  of transport should (in appro-priate shape)  be applied  to  all the others.   To this the  railways would,naturally, raise  no objection.  9. This equality would  have the further advantage  that it would permit&apos;Parliament to deal with transport charges generally without being hampered by endeavours to conform to a system  of  control which has  applied for over  one  hundred years to the railways and  was designed to deal with conditions no longer existent.
1 u b  io. The Railway Companies&apos;  proposals represent merely  a further de-velopment of the claim which they have urged for many years, that theyshould be afforded  equitable conditions of competition.  They are not ask-ing for preferential treatment or any form  of artificial protection.  II. The  conditions of competition which  have prevailed over the pastfifteen years are inequitable, and are prejudicing the efficiency of the rail-ways and  their ability  to meet the calls  which are made  upon  them.This  consideration  is  of  especial  importance,  having  regard  to  the responsibilities  which  would  fall upon the  railways  in  the event of anational emergency. It is already evident that under emergency conditions the railways would be called upon to perform services of  a far  more com-prehensive character than are required of them at the present time,  and ofa far more critical nature than  would be expected  of any other form ofinternal transport.  It is submitted that no  effort should  be spared to seethat equitable  conditions are given during  peace-time to  a public  serviceof such vital  importance  if it  is to  fulfil satisfactorily  the responsibility which must inevitably fall upon  it under conditions of emergency.                             APPENDIX II.MEMORANDUM SUBMITTED TO THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT BY THE RAILWAY            COMPANIES  ASSOCIATION ON  8TH DECEMBER,  1938.              RAILWAY CHARGES  FOR MERCHANDISE TRAFFIC.  1. The Minister, when he received the Chairmen  and General managers of the  Railways on the 23rd November, asked them to amplify that partof  their  Memorandum  which  dealt  with  the  action  to, be  taken.   Inparticular he requested that they should  indicate the nature of the measure which  they would ask  the Minister to present  to Parliament and theirreasons in support of it.  2. The Railways have endeavoured in  this Second Memorandum to meetthe  Ministers wishes.  3. The legislation which the Railways have in view would be short and comprehensive,  and in effect would enable them to make in respect of the carriage of merchandise such charges  as are  appropriate to the traffic to becarried. This would entail the repeal of Part III of the Railways Act, 1921,and also  of various other  Acts and sections  of Acts.  The proposals of theRailways do not extend to passenger fares and the legislation would, there-fore, continue the Railway Rates  Tribunal  in existence.   It is  suggestedthat as regards these fares the proposed legislation might apply machinery&apos;somewhat analogous to that which exists with  regard to the fares  of thesuburban  passenger services of the Railways under the London passenger transport Act,  1933.  4. The  foregoing paragraph indicates  the  scope of the legislation whichthe  Railways have in view.  They submit that nothing less would achieve the  object which they are commending to  the  Minister, namely,  equality with Road Transport.   5. It may be well to review the position of Road Transport in respect of charges for merchandise.   6. A Road Haulier  when applying for an  &quot; A &quot; or &quot; B &quot;  licence may atthe discretion of the Licensing Authority be required to supply particulars of the  traffics  which he expects to carry and at the  rates which he is  atpresent charging.   Whatever may be the  object of this requirement the licensing Authority has no jurisdiction  to  modify the rates submitted byan applicant  for  a licence nor  can any condition be laid down that therates shall in fact  be  charged.
\&apos;0 3  7. A Road Haulier is in fact entirely at large with respect to the charges which he may make for the carriage of freight.   There is no obligation onKim to conform to an intricate  classification  or  to  go to a Court of Lawwhenever he wants to make a substantial cut in a rate or wants to increaseit by the smallest fraction.  He has  complete liberty to  vary his chargesupward  or  downward as he  may think appropriate,  or in a  word,  he is allowed to carry on his business.   If he abused his freedom he would lose his business!  8. The Railways are in the same position in that they too have a vigilantpublic and alert competitors.   They are equally anxious not to lose business.They submit that their sense of  responsibility to the public, their staff andall  the interests which they  serve is  in  no danger  of being undermined ifthe restrictions which impede them are  removed. -  9. The  Railways claim  that their  record  since  amalgamation  in theirdealings  with  traders and trading bodies  entitles  them  to be regarded aspursuing an enlightened and  broad-minded policy in  all questions of mer-chandise charges.  They respectfully  submit that the  consideration of theirpresent  proposals should  be  undertaken  against  this  background, andthey should not  be  exposed to  the  suspicion  that  they  will  abuse  thefreedom  for which they are asking.  10. Leaving aside the record  of the Railways  and the confidence which,we believe, it has created in the minds of the  trading public, we submit that if  it should  prove that  this confidence  has been misplaced, effective means exist by  which Parliament could  bring  them to a sense of theirshortcomings.  ir. The Minister referred especially to the case of the Heavy Industries.He  expressed  the  view that  in relation to these  industries the Railwaysmight still exercise something like monopoly powers, and he indicated thatit would be desirable to consider in  their case  whether something in  thenature of special safeguards should be provided, in the event  of the Rail-way Companies&apos;  general proposals proving acceptable.  12. The Railways have  given  the matter careful thought and submit thefollowing considerations:        (i) The  extent  of the  monopoly  possessed by  the Railways so far     as it can be said to exist is very limited.   Neither the Coal Industry     nor  the Iron and Steel  Industry is confined to  rail transport.      Large quantities of household and industrial  coal now pass by road,     and  the radius of distribution is  extending,  whilst in the  case of Iron     and  Steel, large quantities of pipes,  structural material, tinplates, etc.,     are  carried by road and  in ever increasing  volume.      (ii) Any general attempt  to increase railway charges on the traffics     of the  heavy  industries  would naturally tend  to divert a larger pro-     portion of their materials and output to competing forms of transport.     The Railway Companies would not  lightly incur  such a risk.      (iii) Any partial  or discriminatory  attempt  to raise charges would     be exposed to the same risk over  the narrower field  affected.  It is     doubtful  if there is a single  firm in the Heavy  Trades,  which could     not  increase  the. proportion  of  its road transport in retaliation for     any  action  which it regarded  as  inequitable  on the  part of  the     Railways.      (iv) The Heavy Industries  are efficiently  organised  and can readily     defend themselves  or their  individual  members  against  unfair  or     oppressive action by  a railway.  13. Having regard to the foregoing considerations,  the  Railways do not feel  that any  special safeguards  applicable to  the Heavy Industries  are really necessary.
  14- The  Minister has invited the Railways to specify particular featuresin the present system of regulation, as it applies to merchandise  charges,which are  felt as  exceptionally galling.  The Railways regret  that theycannot follow the Minister into this field.  They are not seeking for a little.relief which may perhaps help them to keep up the unequal battle throughanother round; they are seeking for equality with other forms  of Transport,and  they believe that the sense of  justice of the country will support thiselementary demand.  15. The  Minister has also asked the Railways to indicate what use theywould make of this  equality  if it  were granted.   The  Railways are glad of this  opportunity of doing  so.  16. In asking  for  equality  in the  matter  of  charges for  merchandise,the  Railways have no scheme in  mind for embarking on an increase  ofrates, either  in general or as affecting any particular industry; equally theydo not  contemplate making wholesale reductions and plunging into a ratewar  with  other  forms of  Transport.   Their  charges will  be known  and available to  their  customers  just  like the price-list  of any  large  manu-facturer or  retail-dealer,  and  they will  be varied  in the same way  as circumstances may demand.  17. In any action  which they may take  the  Railways will keep clearlybefore them the advantage to t: e public and to  the Transport industry as a  whole of a co-ordinated  industry.  They believe the new  conditions for which  they are asking, by putting the various competing forms of theIndustry on equal terms,  will promote this  object and not hinder it.  18. They  would remind the  Minister  that this  view is  supported byprevious experience.   When  the Railways  received  their road  powers  in1928 the fear was freely  expressed  that  they would use the  powers  to embark on a campaign of cut-throat competition with the existing omnibuscompanies.  Nothing of the sort occurred the Railways and the OmnibusCompanies  entered into  a friendly  partnership,  underswhich  a  strikingdegree of co-ordination has been effected,  and the public enjoys the most efficient road passenger service in  the world.  19. This result was  only made  possible  by granting  the  Railways theright to compete on equal terms in  road passenger  transport.  The Rail-ways would  wish  to  express  the  modest hope that  similar results mayflow from  similar causes in the case of freight transport.  20. The  Railways are conscious that the Minister attaches importance  tothe objective of  establishing some system of rate regulation applicable notonly  to  Road  Transport but  to the  Transport Industry generally.   Theysubmit  that in this direction also their proposals will help, and not hinder,the end in view.      (i) The present system  of railway rate control is governed by the    principle of Standard  Revenue which involves Standard Charges based    upon an  elaborate Classification.   No such principle is applicable,  or    could.  be applied to other forms  of Transport.  It would therefore be    impossible to apply the same system of control to Transport generally.    While the existing system of railway rate control continues the hope    of unified control could hardly be realised.  This is an important factor    in the proposal which the Railways have submitted to the Minister.      (ii) The co-ordination between  Road and Rail,  which in the view  of    the Railways is likely to advance more rapidly as the result of equality    of conditions between  the two forms of Transport,  will  of  itself help    powerfully towards  the establishment of  a uniform system  of control    since  it  pre-supposes  some considerable measure  of agreement  on    equivalent rates and charges.      (iii)  The larger and  more responsible  road concerns are anxious  to    assist the Minister but their efforts are defeated  by a  less responsible
    section who see their salvation  in maintaining a completely free hand.    When the Railways are put in a position of equality with road hauliers    the possibility of competition will make them more willing to see the    need of conforming to a general rates structure.  21. In general,  the  Railways feel that their proposals,  by conferringequality on all the competitors in the Transport Industry, will contribute substantially towards the  achievement  of co-ordination and  regulation inthe Industry, but it is not possible at this stage  to outline the precise form  which the  ultimate  structure  of  rate  control should take.  At thepresent time road rates and charging practices appear to be too fluid andtoo disparate for any form of control to be made effective  within a reason-able time.  22. This memorandum can only deal with the leading issues involved inthe proposals made by the Railways.   Doubtless  many  other important questions will emerge from their consideration.  The Railways submit  how-ever that these can only usefully be considered  when  the  general principleof de-restricting  the Railways,  in  respect  of  their charging powers formerchandise, has  been  accepted as  desirable and urgent.  23. The Railways would therefore respectfully ask the Minister to inform them  whether the broad  proposals which  they  have put forward are approved by the Government  for urgent action.                            APPENDIX III.    DOCUMENT ATTACHED TO REMIT RECEIVED FROM THE MINISTER OF                              TRANSPORT.  From a  preliminary study  of  the Memoranda presented by the MainLine  Railway  Companies it would seem that  the main features of theexisting statutory  provisions  relating to charges  for  the conveyance of merchandise  by rail  which would  be  affected by  the  railway companies&apos;proposals  would include those set out below; but this  list is not  claimed,or intended,  to be an exhaustive statement  of the matters which may beaffected.  I. The obligation upon the Railway Rates Tribunal so to adjust chargesas to ensure that the net revenue of each Company is equal to its standardrevenue, together with allowances for additional capital raised or provided in respect of further capital expenditure.  [Railways Act, 1921, Section 59and first proviso  to Section 35).  2. The imposition of maximum charges for the carriage  of all commodities-commodities resulting from the obligation to charge  no  more than the standardcharges, based upon a classification of merchandise  and the schedules of standard charges, which can be  varied only by the  Tribunal.   (railways act,  1921, Sections 28 (1)  (a),  29,  31,  32 and 35).  3. The  limitations  on  the  making of  charges other than  standardcharges:        (a) The  obligation  to charge  no less  than the  standard charges    except so far as authorised by Statute to do so.  (Railways Act, 1921,    Section 32).      (6) The obligation to obtain the prior sanction of the Tribunal to    the granting  of new, or the reduction  of existing, exceptional rates    so as to be  more than 40 per cent, below the standard rates charge-    able.   (Railways Act,  1921,  Sections 37  (1)  and  38 (2)  as  amended    by  the Road and Rail Traffic Act,  1933, Section 40).
        (c) The obligation to report to the Minister of Transport  all new,     and reductions in existing, exceptional rates;  and the  power of the     Minister to refer  to the Tribunal in certain circumstances (Railways     Act, 1921, Sections  37  (1) and (2), 38 (2) ).        (d) The obligation to lodge  particulars of agreed charges, to give     notice  of applications for  approval,  and to obtain the prior approval     of the  Tribunal before making the charges; and the provisions govern-     ing approval (Road  and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, Section  37).   4. The protection afforded to canal interests (Railways Act,  1921, Section 39)  and coastwise  shipping interests (Road and Rail Traffic  Act,  1933, Section 39).   5. The limitations upon the  power  of  the  Companies  to  increase  or cancel exceptional rates (Railways Act, 1921, Sections 36 and 38 (3) and (4) as amended by  Road and Rail Traffic Act,  1933,  Section 40).   6. The power in the Tribunal on the application of traders  to fix  new, or reduce existing, exceptional rates (Railways Act,  1921,  Sections 37  (3) and 38 (6) ), or to  fix a charge for the carriage  of the merchandise of ti trader whose business  is detrimentally affected by an agreed  charge made to another  trader (Road and Rail Traffic Act,  1933, Section 37 (6) ).   7. The obligation with  respect to  through  rates  (Railway  and Canal Traffic  Act,  1854,  Section  2;  Railway  and  Canal  Traffic  Act,  1888, Section 25; Railways Act, 1921, Sections 28 (1) (b) and 47).   8. The jurisdiction of  the  Tribunal to determine differences as to other charges (e.g., railways Act,  1921, Sections 28, 49 and 55).   9. The application of  standard terms and  conditions of carriage, which can  be amended  only by the  Tribunal (Railways Act,  1921,  Sections 42 to  45).   10.  The obligation to  charge equally under like circumstances (Railway Clauses Consolidation Act,  1845, Section 90),  and to refrain from giving undue preference (Railway and Canal Traffic Act,  1854, Section  2; Railway and Canal  Traffic  Act,  1888,  Sections  27, 28 and 30); the jurisdiction of the Railway  and Canal  Commission in connection  therewith (Regulation of Railiaays Act,  1873, Section 6; Railway and Canal Traffic  Act,  1888, Sections 8 and 9; Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, Section 37 (9) and (10) ).   II.-(a) The  obligation to  publish the  classification of  merchandise&quot;, schedules of, standard charges,  and exceptional rates  (Railways Act,  1921, Section  54).   (b) The obligation to  publish particulars  of agreed charges  (Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933,  Section  37 (11) ).                            APPENDIX IV.

APPENDIX V,MEMORANDUM  SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL BY THE RAILWAY REPRESENTA-    TIVES  ON  11th JANUARY, 1939,  MODIFYING THE ORIGINAL  PROPOSALS    OF THE RAILWAY  COMPANIES.  At  the  last meeting of the Committee  the  railway representatives were asked to assist its  deliberations by entering into separate discussions withthe various interests concerned  in the proposals  of the railways for theremoval  of the  statutory  restrictions  on their charges for merchandisetraffic in  order to  see what &quot; safeguards &quot; if any are  desired, and howfar they  can be met.   The railway representatives readily acceded  to this request, and have held a series of meetings with the following interests:    Trading  Interests :    Coal.    Iron and Steel.    Agriculture.    Association of  British Chambers of Commerce.    Mansion House Association  on Transport.  Docks.  Other forms  of Transport:    Coastwise  Shipping.    Canals.    Road Hauliers.  The railway representatives think it desirable to  set out  as shortly aspossible the general lines of the scheme of &quot; safeguards &quot; which they havebeen  discussing with these interests.   Time has not permitted of the dis-cussions reaching a conclusion so far as any of the interests  are concerned,and it is  therefore to be  understood  that the proposals have not beenaccepted by  them, although they have been received with varying  degrees of sympathy.  Arising  out  of these discussions the scheme which the  railway repre-sentatives  suggest  as appropriate until a  complete system of co-ordinationhas been established would run on the  following lines:  I. General.  The Railways seek  no alteration in the law relating  to their obligationto  provide reasonable facilities, through  rates or standard  conditions ofcarriage.II. Trading Interests.  (a)  It  is proposed   that  friendly  contact  and  understanding  will  be ensured by  establishing  regular periodical  meetings between  the  variousTrading  Associations  and  the  Railway Companies  for  the discussion ofrailway rates  and charges, trade prices, and  other matters  of common interest.   At these meetings each party would undertake to  give the otherall appropriate information bearing on the  subjects under discussion, and every endeavour would  be  made to  arrive  at a  settlement  by friendlynegotiation.   (6) In the event of agreement proving to  be unattainable,  there wouldbe provided a procedure for appeal  to a  body such as  the  Railway Rates
 Tribunal who  would  have the power of  deciding  on the reasonableness or otherwise of the  charge or charges under dispute.   (c) For the purpose of placing  this procedure on  an established footing certain legislation would be required.  This would  take the form        (i) of a  provision entitling the Railways to make such reasonable     charges as they thought fit,       (ii) of a further provision placing on  a body  such as the Railway     Rates Tribunal  in cases of disagreement  the responsibility for deciding     whether particular  charges  were in fact reasonable,  and  if not  of     fixing reasonable charges.   (d) Every trader,  or body of traders,  would have  the right of appealing on the  question of reasonableness,  although it is  hoped  that normally such cases would  all  be referred before appeal for  discussion at one  or other of the periodical meetings arranged between  the appropriate Trading Association  and the Railway Companies.   The railway  representatives have not  yet had the opportunity of laying these  proposals before the general  body of  traders;  for that  reason  they desire to  emphasize the main features   of the  scheme, which they  have in mind.  These are        (i) All rates must be reasonable rates.       (ii)  If  a trader  or agriculturist thinks the  rate quoted to him is     unreasonable he can appeal  to a body  such as the Railway Rates     Tribunal.       (iii) In  order to  obviate  unnecessary formal  proceedings  and  to     simplify  them,  where  he  is a member of any recognised Trading     Association he  can,  before  appealing,  bring his  complaint before the     regular joint meeting of that Association  and the Railways, as referred     to in  paragraph II  (a), at which all appropriate information will  be     given to him.   It is suggested that  under safeguards  of this description  he will, under existing conditions of competition, have  ample protection against injusticeor excessive  charges.   Ill, Docks.  The Dock and Harbour Authorities&apos; Association fear that if the Railwaysreceive the liberty which they are seeking,  they may use it       (a)  to  favour  Railway-owned  Docks  against  independently-owned    Docks by quoting  lower rates to the former than to the latter,      (6) to  favour one  port against another by disregarding the general    relativity of rates and charges  at present established between them.  It is proposed to  meet these  fears by  the  following measures:        (i)  It is  proposed to  establish regular  periodical meetings between    the Dock  Association  and  the  Railways, at  which all questions of    railway  rates and charges,  and dock  charges  could be  mutually    discussed.   At these  meetings each  party would undertake to give    the other all appropriate information bearing on the matters under    discussion,  and  every  endeavour would be  made to  arrive  at  a    settlement by friendly negotiation.   The  discussions  would  deal  not    only  with  individual  rates  or  charges,  but also  with  more general    questions,  such   as the relative  level of railway rates,  or of dock    charges at different Ports or groups of Ports.     (ii) In  the event  of agreement proving to be unattainable,  it would    be necessary to  set up some machinery for reference to an impartial    body or tribunal for decision or settlement.     It is proposed  that such  Tribunal  should, in deciding these cases,   be empowered to consider the reasonableness of the rates or charges
    complained of, having regard generally to  the public interest,  and    also to  the adequacy  of  the rates, to  the  rates  quoted  to other    docks  or ports, the competitive  conditions  and  other relevant con-    siderations.      (iii)  Special  legislation will be necessary to  empower the  Tribunal    to deal  with  appeals from  the Dock Association or individual Dock    Companies  or  the Railway  Companies.   A  clause  covering what  is    required can  be readily drafted and included  in the  proposed Bill.    It would  authorise  the Tribunal  to  take  into  account  the  whole    level of  the Rates charged to the port in respect of which complaint    Was made, and to pronounce upon  their reasonableness.)JV.   Other forms  of Transport.  From the  recent talks  with canals, coastwise shipping  and road hauliers,it seems likely that there  will be a  number of points on  which common ground can  be found.       (a)  There  is  general adherence  to  the  view expressed by the    Transport  Advisory Council in their report  on Service  and Rates    that  it  is  desirable to  establish as great a  degree of co-ordination    as  possible  among  the various forms  of transport  engaged  in the    carriage of  goods, so  as  to ensure that  each  form  of  transport  is    used  to the  greatest  national advantage.      (6) There is general recognition of the  difficulty  of effecting co-    ordination  between  Transport systems  whose  charges are  based on-    widely  different principles  and  it is  not  considered  practicable  to    apply  to other forms of transport  the  present railway rates  structure    with its  elaborate classification, restrictions and obligations.      (c)  It is  also  generally  recognised  that  the acceptance  of  the    railways&apos; proposals  subject  to  suitable  conditions  will  enable them    to build up a  new and simpler rates structure which will not only be    better adapted to  the  needs of traders, but  will  also  facilitate agree-    ment  between  all forms of  transport on such matters as a uniform    system of rate control, correlated  rates  structures and standard  con-    ditions of carriage.  Questions  of  particular concern to canals, coastwise shipping  and roadhauliers are dealt with separately below.(a)  Canals.  In  the  case of  Canals   there  is  already  in  existence  an  Agreementbetween the Railways and the  Canal Association.  The  purpose  of thisAgreement is to promote  co-operation between the Canals and the Railways.It has  operated with  fair  satisfaction to both  parties,  and  has enableda substantial degree of  co-ordination to be  obtained.  It is proposed  tostrengthen this Agreement in  a variety of ways:         (i)  It  will be extended  to form an agreement between the whole    of the canals individually, the canal carriers and the railway companies,    with  power to  embrace  road hauliers.   (The Aire &amp;  Calder Canal    already  has a separate agreement with the  four railway companies,    and does not  desire  any change in its arrangements.)       (ii)  It already provides for discussion of all points of disagreement.    It  will  provide in future  for matters,  upon which  agreement proves    to  be unattainable,  to be referred  to  a representative of the  Canal    Association and of the Railways, who may if they  agree call in some    third party to arbitrate upon the matter.  Alternatively, they  may, if    they  prefer it, refer the case to the Railway  and  Canal  Commission    for decision.   No special legislation is required in this case.
       (iii) In cases of breach of agreement it is provided that penalties may-    be exacted from  the  defaulting party, the assessment of the amount    being fixed by the same procedure as that set out under paragraph (ii)    above.       (iv) The agreement as modified, is to run for five  years certain, and    thereafter subject to twelve months notice on either side. (b) Coastwise Shipping.  The representatives of coastwise  shipping attach considerable importance to the statutory protection which they have been  given by Parliament against rail competition, but the value of this protection has to some extent been nullified owing to the  unregulated development of road competition, against which they have no similar protection.  The Transport Advisory Council  has already expressed the  view that the present voluntary agreement between  the  railways and coasting liner com- panies should be strengthened  and  ultimately  embrace road hauliers.  This agreement has  been reviewed and it is proposed that if and when the rail- ways secure the freedom  which they  now  seek it should be superseded bya new agreement to operate for a definite period of five years. The new agree- ment  would provide  for  the holding  of  regular conferences  to settle  all rate questions  of mutual  interest and would  have as its  main  object the promotion of the greatest possible measure of co-operation and co-ordina- tion between  the  parties.   It is  hoped  that road  hauliers  will become parties to the agreement as soon as they are in a position  to  do  so.  With regard  to tramp shipping,  it is proposed that periodic conferences should be held to discuss matters of common interest, at which all relevant information as to rates charged will be exchanged. (c) Road  Hatdiers.  (i) The road hauliers urged  that if the railways  are given freedom  to quote  such  rates as they  may  consider appropriate for the conveyance of merchandise traffic by  rail, they  should  waive  their right  to object  toapplications for the renewal of licences, and to the  granting of additionallicences to existing road hauliers  on the ground that  adequate facilities by rail are available.  The railway representatives pointed out that the right of objection under Section n of the Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933 is conferred on all forms of transport,  and in their view the exercise of this  right  has served as a means for placing  before  the Licensing Authorities information  concerning existing transport facilities  which is   necessary  for  the  proper discharge of their duties under the  Act.  The Licensing Authorities in exercising  their  discretion either  to grant or to  refuse an application  for an &quot;A&quot;  or  &quot; B &quot;  licence  must, in the terms  of  the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, &quot; have regard primarily to the interests of  the public generally,  including those of persons requiring, as well as those of persons providing, facilities for transport.&quot;   The rail- way representatives hold the view  that the principle  thus  embodied in the Act of 1933 is essential in any system  of licensing if a properly co-ordinated system of transport is to be established, but,  with a view to allaying the apprehension which has been expressed that, in the altered circumstances,adequate  facilities to traders might not be available as a result  of railwayobjection, the railways are prepared  to  give  an undertaking that  unless there are exceptional circumstances they  will not. raise  objection duringthe ensuing two years after they have been given their freedom  whetherthe application is for:         (a)  the renewal, without any alteration,  of existing    A &quot; or  &quot; B    licences;       (b)  the granting to  existing hauliers  of &quot; A &quot;  licences for additional    vehicles;
      (c) the granting to  existing hauliers of additional &quot; B &quot;  licences for    vehicles whose  operations  are limited to a radius not  exceeding 20    miles.This undertaking is not, however, to extend so as to preclude a railwaycompany from giving, on request, information to  a Licensing Authorityconcerning existing transport facilities which it provides, either in writingor in oral evidence, or from objecting to applications on the ground  thatthe applicant has failed  to comply with the conditions of his licence or to observe the regulations regarding the rates of pay,  hours of duty, etc.  It is  understood that  the road hauliers welcome this  undertaking,  andthat  having  regard  to  the importance   of  securing  due  and  universalobservance  of the conditions attached to licences,  their industry will beprepared  to  co-operate with the  railways in making representation  to the licensing Authorities in all appropriate  cases  of  breaches of the  law.  (ii) With a view to facilitating co-operation between rail and road trans-port,  both  in regard to  general measures  of co-ordination  and also inconnection with  matters more  immediately affecting their own industries,it is proposed  that a  Central Consultative  Committee of rail  and  roadrepresentatives  should be  set  up by voluntary arrangement between theparties.  The Central Committee would  be  free to draw up its  own  rules of  procedure, and  would  have  the  right,  as  it  thought fit, to appointRegional Committees.   It is considered that this  machinery  would affordvaluable opportunities both for  the  free  discussion of difficulties and also for considering  constructive measures affecting the  two  forms  of  trans-port.   As an immediate task it  is proposed that the  Central  consultative committee should consider and formulate the principles on which voluntaryagreements  could be entered into in regard to the rates to be charged by rail and road  for  merchandise  traffic,   either generally or in  respect  ofparticular commodities  or particular routes or areas, with due regard  tothe effect of such agreements on other interests.   With a view  to facilitating  the co-ordination of all forms of transport,it is proposed that in the  legislation which will be necessary to  give  effectto  the railways&apos; application, provision should be  made for a  conferenceof representatives of all forms of transport to be held forthwith under the aegis of  the Minister of  Transport  in order  to  reach agreement upon  a uniform  system of rates  control, correlated rate  structures and standardconditions  of carriage:  such  conference to continue  until  agreement  isreached between the parties, and statutory effect to be given to it if andwhen it is approved by the Minister with any modifications which he may consider necessary.  Failing agreement by  the parties within three  years from the passing of the  Act,   the  Minister  of  Transport  should  havepower  to determine the  matters above  mentioned and his decision shallbe binding.   The  railway  representatives  are  prepared to accept  the suggestion  ofthe Chairman that the  Bill should be for a period of five years.                             APPENDIX VI.MEMORANDUM SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL BY THE RAILWAY COMPANIES AND           THE LIAISON  COMMITTEE ON ROAD TRANSPORT RATES.                               SECTION (I). The  constitution and work  of the Liaison Committee on Road  Transport                                  Rates.   1. The Liaison  Committee  consists  of  representatives  of holders  of &quot;A&quot;  and  &quot; B &quot; Licences of all the National Road Transport organisa- tions,  and  was established in January,  1938, following the  issue  of the Transport Advisory Council&apos;s  Report  on Service  and  Rates, and  the announcement  of the Minister of Transport that he intended in  due course
                               SECTION (2).                    Co-ordination a common objective.   3.  Throughout the discussions both parties have kept in mind the view expressed by the Minister of Transport that due regard must be given to the ultimate  objective  of the  co-ordination  of  all forms  of  transport. The Railways and the Liaison Committee are in agreement that this should be the objective, and they adhere to the view expressed by the Transport Advisory Council in its Report on Service and Rates that &quot;it is desirable to establish as great a degree of co-ordination as possible among the various forms of transport engaged in the carriage  of  goods, so as to ensure that each form of transport is used to the greatest national advantage.&quot;  Accord- ingly, nothing should  be  done to embarrass  or postpone such objective.   4. Both  the  Railways  and the  Liaison  Committee are, however,  con- vinced that it would not be practicable  to apply  to  road transport the present railway rates structure with its elaborate classification,  restrictions and obligations.   5. Notwithstanding anything that follows  herein, the Liaison Committee is of opinion that relief from restrictions should not be given to any  form of transport, however necessary in other directions, if  such relief should in any way prejudice the bringing about at an early date of rate structures applicable to all forms of public transport governed by suitable  Tribunals.   6. The Transport Advisory Council has already recommended that Road Hauliers  should be afforded an  opportunity to build  up  a  rate structure for their own industry, and that co-ordination with other forms of trans- port should ultimately be effected through the medium  of voluntary agree- ments.  The Railways urge that the acceptance of their proposals, subject to the general safeguards proposed by them, will  enable them to build up a  new  and simpler rate structure,  and  will  also facilitate agreement between all forms of transport on such  matters as a uniform system of rate control, correlated rate structures and  standard conditions of carriage.   7. The  Liaison Committee, on  the  other hand,  was  not satisfied  thatthe general  safeguards proposed by the Railways were  adequate, and  asthe outcome of the  discussions  which have  taken place certain specialsafeguards for the road haulage industry have been agreed to and acceptedby both sides.  On the basis of these safeguards, which are dealt with  indetail later in this memorandum, the Liaison Committee raises no objectionto the proposals of the Railways for the removal of statutory control  oftheir merchandise charges, as contained in their memoranda to the Ministerof Transport dated 23rd November and 8th December, 1938, and in thestatement entitled &quot; Amplification of the Railway Proposals &quot; issued by theTransport Advisory Council on 13th January, 1939.to  introduce  legislation  on  the lines  suggested  by  the Council.   TheLiaison Committee was set up with the express purpose of evolving a.x-oadrate structure, together with  the necessary adjuncts such as uniform terms and conditions of carriage.  2. The Liaison Committee,  which had  hitherto  been working along thelines  of  the  report of  the Transport Advisory Council, found  itself  con-fronted  with  a  new situation in  the  shape of the  Railways&apos;  claim  forfreedom from rate control.   The  Liaison  Committee therefore felt  thatinformal discussion might be helpful  to  both  sides,  and this  suggestion was readily accepted by the Railways.   In consequence a series of meetingshas been held, and it has become  possible to submit this memorandum  asa joint memorandum to the Council.
                              SECTION (3).                         Conditions of Carriage.  8. A considerable measure of agreement has already been reached amongRoad Hauliers in regard to standard conditions of carriage.  Having regardto the views which have been placed before them, the Railways are pre-pared to withdraw their request for the repeal of the existing law relatingto their own conditions of carriage, and are  prepared to continue to acceptthe obligation to obtain  the approval of the Rates Tribunal to any modi-fications which may subsequently  be found desirable in order  to secureuniformity of  conditions of carriage  for  all  forms of transport until such time as a comprehensive  scheme embracing all forms of transport has been devised.                              SECTION (4).         Objections to  applications  for  &quot; A &quot; and  &quot; B &quot; Licences.  9. The Liaison  Committee  has  urged that,  if  the  Railways  are giventhe freedom  in  their  charging  powers  for  which they  ask,  it  would.nolonger be appropriate for them to object to  applications  for the renewal of licences, and for the grant of additional licences to existing Road Hauliers,on  the ground that adequate facilities by rail are available.   10. The Railways point  out that the right of objection under  Section nof  the Road and Rail  Traffic Act,  1933,  is conferred on  all forms of trans-port, and in their view the exercise of this  right has served as a means of placing  before the Licensing Authorities information concerning existingtransport facilities which  is  necessary for  the proper  discharge of their duties under  the Act.   It is recognised that  the Licensing Authorities in  exercising  their dis-cretion either to  grant or  to refuse an application for an &quot; A &quot; or &quot; B &quot;Licence  must, in the terms of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, &quot; haveregard  primarily to the interests  of the public generally,  including thoseof  persons requiring,  as well as those of persons providing,  facilities  for transport.&apos;&apos;   11.  The Railways hold the view that the principle thus embodied in the Act of 1933 is essential in any system of licensing if a properly co-ordinated system of transport is to be established but, with a view to affording Road Hauliers greater freedom in the meantime to negotiate within their industry voluntary  agreements towards the  establishment of such  a system,  the Railways are prepared to give an undertaking that, unless after consulta- tion with the Central  Consultative Committee (referred to in paragraph 14) either  side feels that there are exceptional circumstances, they will  not raise objection during the ensuing two years after  they have been  given their freedom whether the application is for: :       (a) the renewal, without any alteration,  of existing &quot;A&quot; or &quot; B &quot;     licences;       (6) the granting to existing  hauliers of &quot; A &quot; licences for additional     vehicles;       (c) the granting to existing  hauliers of additional &quot; B &quot; licences for     vehicles whose operations are limited to  a radius not exceeding 25 miles.The Railways make it  clear,  however, that  this undertaking  is not toextend so  as to  preclude  a railway  company from giving,  on request,information to a Licensing Authority concerning existing transport facilities which it provides, or from objecting to an  application on the ground thatthe applicant has failed to comply with the conditions of the  licence.   12.  The  Liaison Committee  acknowledges the  value of this  proposalbut considers that  the  case law  established  up to  the present  by theobjections of  the Railways in  the past would have  the effect of  visibly
 diminishing the value  of the proposal.   It is  therefore accepted  without prejudice to any subsequent action by either party in seeking amendment of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933,  in this respect.   13. The Railways  and the Liaison Committee agree that  the  industries shall co-operate as far as practicable with a view to securing due observance of the conditions attached to  licences.                               SECTION (5).           Proposed machinery designed to effect co-ordination.   14. With  a  view  to facilitating  co-operation  between road  and rail transport, both in regard  to general measure of co-ordination  and also  in connection with matters more immediately affecting their own industries, it  is  agreed that  a  Central  Consultative  Committee of road  and rail representatives shall be set up forthwith by voluntary arrangement between the parties.  The Central Committee  will draw up its own  rules  of pro- cedure, and will have the right, as it thinks fit, to appoint Regional Com- mittees.  It is  considered that machinery of this kind  will afford valuable opportunities both for the free discussion of difficulties  and also for con-  sidering constructive measures affecting the two forms of transport.  As an immediate task it is agreed that the  Central Consultative Committee will consider  and formulate the principles  on which voluntary agreements can be entered into in  regard to the rates to  be charged  by road and rail for merchandise traffic,  either generally or in  respect of particular com- modities  or  particular routes or  areas, with  due regard  to  the  effect  of such  agreements on other  interests.   15. The Liaison Committee is convinced that, owing to the  large number of  operating units in the  road haulage industry, adherence  to voluntary agreements cannot  be relied  upon,  and that  some measure  of  statutory control is an  essential preliminary  to an  attempt at co-ordination with other forms of transport.   In order, therefore, to make  joint agreements effective, it  will be  necessary  to  obtain statutory powers to secure their observance by all Road Hauliers between the points or in the areas affected. In the  considered opinion of the Liaison Committee such powers are neces- sary,  not at some future distant date when the country as a whole might be  covered by  a general  comprehensive rate  structure,  but  immediately agreements are  entered  into, not  only  on routes and in districts  but even for specific traffic on those  routes  or in  those  districts.   The Liaison Committee has therefore  urged  that  any Bill repealing restrictions  on railway charges should include clauses  providing for machinery to sanction agreements and making  the specified rates  and  conditions  of  carriage obligatory on all &quot; A &quot; and  &quot; B &quot;  licence holders and  on  the Railway Companies  where  concerned.   The  Liaison  Committee  submitted  draft Clauses designed to achieve these  objects (see Appendix).   16. The Railways have been deeply impressed by the importance attached to these  proposals by the Liaison Committee.   They recognise  that the object of the draft  Clauses is to  facilitate measures of co-ordination, and that  in the  absence  of the  proposed  powers the  Liaison Committee see no immediate prospect of being able to achieve co-ordination within their own industry.   Having regard to the ultimate common  objective,  the Rail- ways  are prepared to agree to  the principle  of the proposed  Clauses for inclusion  in any Bill removing railway restrictions.                              SECTION (6).     Additional Special Safeguards for the  Road  Haulage Industry.  17.  Classification. The  Liaison  Committee  has  felt  some  apprehensionlest the removal of  the present  statutory requirements  of the  Railways
in regard  to  classification  should seriously  retard, and possibly bring to&apos;a complete standstill, progress towards co-ordination.  Their fear has been based on  the ground that the  Railways  might  attempt  to  function asfreight carriers entirely without any classification of goods,  and so produceinnumerable complications  and difficulties.  The Railways have, however, given an  assurance that,  while they are seeking to be free  from the  existing statutory  requirements in regard toclassification, they  would of necessity have a voluntary system  of classifi-cation in order to maintain their own commercial organisation on a soundfooting.   The removal of statutory control  will,  moreover, enable the Rail-ways to modify their classification as may  prove necessary  in the interestsof a co-ordinated system  of  rates.   18. Publication of Rales. In this matter also  the Railways  have given an  assurance that, though they seek to be free from the statutory obliga- tion to publish rates, they  will in practice, publish  lists  of rates for the use of traders.    19.  Undue Preference. The Liaison Committee has  felt some  appre-  hension lest the freedom  which the Railways seek from the present obliga-  tions in respect of undue preference might be used coercively to the detriment  of the road haulage industry.  The Railways point out that it is an explicit part of their proposals  that  they should charge reasonable rates, and that  there  should be a right  of  appeal  by traders  on the  question of reason-  ableness  to  a  tribunal, such  as  the  Rates Tribunal  referred to in the  Appendix.   It  is  agreed that, in  considering the  question  of  reasonableness, the  Tribunal should have regard to the rates charged for traffic of  the same  description  carried  under identical  conditions between the  same points,  and also to the rates charged by  competing forms of  transport  or agreed  with them with a view to avoiding uneconomic transport rates.   20. Agreed Charges and Special Road Transport  Contracts. It^is agreed  by the  Liaison  Committee and the Railways  that,  as  far as  competitive  traffic  is concerned,  the  right of the  Railways to  make  Agreed  Charges,  and the  present practice  of  the Road  Haulage Industry to make  Contract  Charges  other than on  a per ton per mile  basis,  will have to  come under  review immediately  any  approach to  the relationship of  rail and road  rates is attempted.                                SECTION (7).                                 Conclusion.    21. The Railways and  the Liaison Committee  urge that, in  view of the  agreement reached and the legislation proposed  to give  effect to it, the  Government should  defer any  further legislation  to  give  effect to the  recommendations  of the  Transport Advisory Council on the setting  up  of  a rate structure for a period  of two years.   If,  after the lapse of two years,  reasonable progress has not been made, it would  be open to the Minister  of  Transport to introduce suitable legislation.    22. The proposals put forward  in this memorandum involve only such  legislation as  is  considered essential  to  give effect to  measures  of  co-  ordination agreed between  the Rail and Road Haulage  industries.  Both  parties desire to emphasise the importance which they attach to the scheme  of voluntary  consultation outlined in  paragraph  14.   It  is their  intention  to  set  up this  machinery  of consultation  forthwith  and to co-operate fully  in  seeking a sound  basis for the  future development of their industries in  the transport  organisation  of  the country.  They  would point  out that  the statutory provisions  which they here recommend  contain  ample safe-  guards for the protection of trade  and industry in the form of a right of  appeal to a judicial tribunal;  whilst nothing in the proposals involves any  interference with  the right  of the trader to use his own vehicles  under a
                                                               173                                  52&quot; C &quot;  Licence.  The two forms of  transport Rail and  Road will con-tinue to exist side  by side as competitive but co-ordinated agencies.  Thecompetition will, however, be of a different kind, for,  under a correlatedsystem of  rates, it will more than ever be the object, and  the interest,of each to win traffic by the quality of the service which it renders.

DEAR MR. EDWARDS,              RAILWAY  CHARGES  FOR MERCHANDISE  TRAFFIC.   Arising out of the Joint Memorandum to the Transport Advisory Council by  the four Main  Line Railway Companies and the Liaison Committee on  Road Transport Rates, it is  agreed and  understood between the  two industries that, in  order to achieve that  co-ordination to  which the Joint Memorandum is directed, neither the Railway Companies on the one hand nor the Road Haulage industry on the  other will embark upon a policy of cut-throat competition calculated to defeat that co-ordination,  and further, that both  industries  will  co-operate in an  endeavour to  establish co- ordinated rate structures and to this end  will take, in consultation and by collaboration with each other, such steps as  they may consider necessary or desirable  for the establishment of such agreements as are contemplated by the Joint Memorandum.   Furthermore, every effort will be made by  both industries to reach  fair and reasonable rates agreements with due regard fo  each other&apos;s interests as well as for the interests of the trading public and other carriers.   The  Railways take note of the view expressed  by the  Road Haulage Industry as to the  possibility of  their seeking at a  future date some re- vision of the provisions of Part I of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933. They are prepared, at a date prior to the termination of the  two year period referred to in Clause 11 of the  Joint  Memorandum,  to enter  into, discussions of  such  proposals in  a sympathetic  spirit  on the clear under- standing that any modification put forward shall apply equally to all forms of transport.

I am in receipt of your letter of the  16th instant in relation to the joint memorandum to the Transport Advisory Council by the four  Main LineRailway Companies and the Liaison  Committee on Road Transport Rates,which I have pleasure in confirming on behalf of the Liaison  Committee.                         Yours faithfully,                             On behalf of the Liaison Committee                                   on Road Transport Rates,                                                    WM.

MEMORANDUM SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL BY THE RAILWAY AND CANAL                           REPRESENTATIVES.  (1) We have considered the proposals of the Railways for the repeal ofthe  existing statutory  regulation  of  the  charges for  the conveyance of merchandise traffic, and the requirements  attached thereto, in the light ofthe  possible reaction which  such  repeal  might have  on the interests ofthe Canal Industry.  (2) We have had  the benefit of hearing the views of  representatives ofthe Canal Association and  of the  National Association of Canal Carriers,and are  much indebted to them  for the valuable assistance which theyhave given  us in arriving at our conclusions.  (3) We have  borne  in  mind the  view expressed by the Minister ofTransport that &quot; due regard must be given to the ultimate objective of theco-ordination of all forms of transport,&quot; and the proposals which we makehereunder are designed  to facilitate the early attainment  of this  end whichwe  recognise is desirable in the public interests.  (4) The Railways  desire to  be afforded an  opportunity of placing their rates structure on a less complicated footing and of adapting it better to meetthe requirements of traders.   We  think it is desirable that  the Railwaysof the agreement come to between the two industries and that consequentlyif these proposals be not carried out substantially in their entirety then theparties must be  considered to be at large.                        Yours faithfully,                            On behalf of the Railway Companies.                                                              STAMP.W. Edwards, Esq.,          Chairman,        Liaison Committee on  Road  Transport Rates,            120, Pall Mall, S.W.I.
 should be afforded this opportunity if it can be achieved without detriment to the  Canal  Industry and if  it  would  assist in enabling  all forms of transport at an early date to come under a common system of control and to correlate their rates structures with  a  view  to  erisuring  as  far as practicable  that each form of transport is used to, the  greatest national advantage.   (5) It is  generally  recognised  that  co-ordination  cannot  be  effected between transport systems whose charges are based  on  widely differing principles and we agree that it  would not be practicable  to  apply the present railway rates structure with its elaborate classification,  restrictions and  obligations,  to other forms of transport.  We are,  however,  of the opinion that co-ordination  is none the less desirable on that account and that it should be kept steadily in view in any modification of  the rail  rates structure as well as in the creation of a road rates structure.   (6) Since  some  interval must  necessarily elapse between the passing of the  legislation to  give  effect to  the  proposals of the-. Railways and the bringing into operation of  a general  scheme for  the  co-ordination of all forms of transport, we  think that statutory  Canal Carriers in the  interim period should be. placed on an equal footing with  the  Railways and that they  should therefore be given the like relief from the existing statutory regulation of  the  charges  for the conveyance of  merchandise  traffic by canal, and the requirements attached thereto,  as the Railways are seeking in relation  to  the conveyance  of merchandise  traffic by  rail,  and  we accordingly  recommend that provisions affording statutory Canal Carriers the necessary relief in this respect should be  included in the  legislation to give  effect to the proposals of the Railways.   (7)  The Railways agree that the existing standard conditions of carriage should be continued with statutory effect and also the obligation to obtain the approval  of  the  Railway Rates Tribunal to any  modifications which may  subsequently be  found  desirable in  order to secure uniformity of conditions  of  carriage  with other  forms of transport  until  such time as a comprehensive  scheme  embracing  other  forms  of  transport  has  been devised.   (8)  For some years past  there  has been a voluntary  agreement between the Railways and the Canal Association for the holding of joint conferences to promote the greatest possible measure  of co-ordination and co-operation between the parties in dealing with all competitive traffic.  This agreement has worked satisfactorily up  to a point, but in several instances considerable difficulty has  been experienced  in dealing  with rates  for traffic which is susceptible to  unregulated   road  competition.   The present  agreement is terminable by 12 months&apos; notice on either side and it contains no provision for settling any differences which may  arise.  We consider it desirable that a new agreement on a wider basis, to  which the members of  the National Association of Canal  Carriers and other recognised  associations of  carriers by water  would  also be parties, should  be negotiated forthwith,  that it should operate for a fixed  period  of  five years unless in the  meantime some  uniform  system of rate control is introduced which will render the agreement unnecessary and that provision should  be made  (a)  for deter- mining any matters affecting particular rates on  which  the  parties  may fail to agree and (6) to  ensure that the agreement  will be effective.  The Canal interests  point out that since an agreement  on these lines will  con- stitute the  sole  practical safeguard for Canals  against the possible effect of the Railways&apos; proposals, it is  essential  that a  satisfactory  agreement should be  settled before those proposals are given  statutory  sanction.  (9)  We recognise  that any voluntary  agreements covering traffics  whichare susceptible to road  transport  competition cannot be made fully effec-tive  in the  absence of  an  effective  organisation  of the  Road haulage industry.  Also, that if and  when  voluntary agreements  become part of
a. general scheme of co-ordination, they should be subject to the approvalof an appropriate tribunal before whom trading interests could be heard.  Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows:        (i) We  recognise that it is in the public interest  that the  greatest    possible measure of co-ordination should be established  without delay    between the various forms of transport engaged in the conveyance of    merchandise traffic.      (ii) We  consider  that  the Railways&apos; proposals,  subject to the  safe-    guards herein mentioned, and if accompanied by constructive proposals    designed to facilitate and  accelerate co-ordination  between the various    forms  of  transport,  would enable the Railwa3&apos;S to co-operate  with    other forms of transport in the  building up of a correlated rates structure-    ture and  a common system of  rate control.      (iii)  We recommend that statutory Canal Carriers  should be placed    on  the same  footing as  the  Railways in relation to charges for the    conveyance  of  merchandise  traffic  and  the  requirements  attached    thereto.       (iv) We  agree that the existing statutory control of  conditions of    carriage of merchandise  by rail should be  continued.       (v)  We  recommend  that  the  voluntary agreement  now  existing    between the Railways  and the  Canal Association should be  replaced    by an agreement on a wider basis to be settled before the Railways&apos;    proposals  are given statutory sanction; that it should be  for a  fixed    period of  five  years, and  that  provision should  be  included for the    final  determination  of  any differences which may arise between the    parties in  regard to  particular rates.      (vi)  We think it desirable  that  if and  when voluntary  agreements    between the various forms of  transport become  part of  a  general    scheme of co-ordination, they should be subject to the approval of an    appropriate TriDunal before whom trading interests could  be heard.F.

APPENDIX VIII.MEMORANDUM  SUBMITTED  TO  THE COUNCIL  BY THE RAILWAY AND  DOCK                    AND HARBOUR REPRESENTATIVES.  (1) In considering the question remitted to us by the Minister of Trans-port in his letter of the 12th December last, we have given special attentionto the  position of Dock Undertakings.   Some of  these  are  conducted as independent undertakings,  under local ownership and management,  whilstothers  are  owned and managed by Railway Companies   as  ancillaryundertakings.  (2) We have discussed the matter with representatives of the Dock and harbour Authorities&apos;  Association.  They urge that if the Railways wereliberated  from  the existing  system of  control  over their  merchandisecharges, they would have an unfettered  power to favour their own  docks at the expense of independent Dock Undertakings;  further, that they  wouldbe in a position to disturb the proper relativity of rates between competingPorts or Docks, irrespective of ownership, and thus introduce an  element of instability which would  be contrary to the public interest and prejudicial to particular Ports or  Docks.
STAMP.R. L. WEDGWOOD,   (3)  We agree generally that  there is force  in  this contention and that some  form of safeguard is called for, and recommend that any independent Dock  Authority  which alleges  that a Railway Company is by  its rates or otherwise prejudicing the  undertaking of that Authority, should have the right to make complaint to the Railway and Canal Commission which should have power to hear  and determine  the  subject matter of any such complaint and  give such relief as  it may think proper.  The establishment of such  a  right  of appeal  would require legislation and we propose that an  appropriate clause should form  part  of any Bill repealing the present restrictions on  the Railways.   (4)  With a  view to avoiding disputes  and to ensure closer  contact and co-ordination  between the  independent Dock Undertakings  and the Rail- way Undertakings we also  recommend as  follows:          (a) There  should be  regular and formal  meetings between the Dock      and Harbour Authorities&apos;  Association and the Railway. Companies, to      be held at such intervals as  may be agreed, at which all questions of      railway rates charged  or to  be charged and other matters of mutual      interest,  as  affecting any  Port,  Harbour  or Dock,  could be brought     up for discussion and  if possible adjustment.        (?;) Local or district meetings of the  two  sides could also be arranged,     and matters brought up  at these, meetings should be settled  as far as     possible by agreement,  with reference to the central meeting on points     of  difference.        (c) Each side should undertake to give to the other full information     on all points relevant  to  the matters  under  discussion, and any     accredited representative  of the Dock  and Harbour Authorities&apos; Asso-     ciation should be entitled to information as to  any railway rate and     any condition  applicable thereto  in  which any  member of the Asso-     ciation may  be interested.   (5)  It is  evident that if the proposals  which we are  putting forward  in regard to the co-ordination of  all forms of transport are approved, fresh and amending  legislation will be required as soon as a scheme for  a corre- lated  rates structure and a  common form of rate control has been  brought into shape.  Under our proposals this development should not be  delayed beyond five years,  and might be  far enough advanced for legislation even before that period.    We  therefore agree  to  the proposal  that  the Act should in the  first instance  run for a maximum period of five years.   This proposal has the  further advantage that the Dock and Harbour Authorities&apos; Association, or individual Dock Undertakings,  if they find the new Act operates in any way  to their disadvantage, will have an opportunity pre- sented to them within a comparatively short period  of  time for proposing appropriate amendments or  further safeguards for inclusion in any new Act.   (6)  Subject  to  the arrangements  outlined in the previous  paragraphs, we  believe the effect  of  the  changes  proposed will  be to  ensure closer contact  and co-ordination between  the  independent Dock  Undertakings and the Railway  Companies with consequent  advantage to  the efficiency of the transport  system  as  a whole.

                            APPENDIX  IX.MEMORANDUM  SUBMITTED TO  THE COUNCIL BY THE  RAILWAY  COMPANIES                 AND THE  COASTING LINER  COMPANIES.  (I)  We have  considered all matters of common interest arising  out ofthe proposal of the  railways that they should be relieved from the exist-ing statutory regulation of their charges for the conveyance of merchandisetraffic and the requirements attached thereto, except those relating to theprovision of reasonable  facilities,  through rates and standard  conditionsof carriage.  (2)  We have had  several meetings with representatives of Coasting LinerShipping (appointed by the  Chamber of  Shipping)  and are much indebtedto  them for the valuable  assistance which they have  given to  us in arriving at our conclusions.  (3)  We  have borne  in mind the view expressed by  the  Minister ofTransport that &quot; due regard  must be given  to  the  ultimate  objective ofthe co-ordination of all forms  of transport  &quot;,  and  adhere  to the  view expressed by  the Transport  Advisory Council in its Report on  Serviceand  Rates that &quot; it is  desirable to  establish as great  a degree of co-ordination as  possible among the various forms of  transport  engaged inthe carriage of goods, so as to ensure that each form of transport  is usedto the  greatest national  advantage &quot;.  Further we have noted  and desireto record the view  expressed  by the Coasting Liner  Trade to  the Govern-ment that the  foremost essential  need for that trade  is  effective co-ordination  between  the  Railways,  road hauliers, canals and coastwise shipping, to  avoid  unnecessary overlapping  of services  and  uneconomic competition.  (4)  The Transport Advisory Council  has already recommended that  RoadHauliers should be  afforded an opportunity  to  build up  a rate structurefor their own industry, a step which is an essential preliminary to  general co-ordination between all forms of goods transport.   It is recognised thatthe building  up of  a comprehensive  road rate  structure must take  con-siderable time, and the Coasting Liner Companies, therefore,  support therecommendations which  have been put  forward  by the  Road and  RailSub-Committee, one of the  main objects of which  is  to secure immediatelya certain measure  of co-ordination between  those interests by voluntary agreement.  The Coasting Liner Companies  desire,  however,  to urge thedesirability of the Coasting Liner  Trade being represented on  the proposedCentral Consultative  Committee  of the Railways  and  Road  Transport,feeling  that this Committee will of necessity, at the  outset of its delibera-tions, be obliged to consider  principles of fundamental importance to the coasting Liner Trade.   They submit that such representation is necessary from  the  inception  of the  Central  Consultative  Committee,  not only tosafeguard the interests of the Coasting Liner  Trade,  but also to ensure themaximum  early progress to  general  co-ordination  as  advocated  by theTransport Advisory Council.   (5) The representatives of the Coasting Liner Companies attach consider-able  importance to the statutory protection which they have been given byParliament as  regards rail  competition,  but the  value of this protectionhas been lessened by the development under  inadequate regulation of roadcompetition, against which they have  not similar protection.   (6) The Transport Advisory Council has already accepted the view thatwhen the  proposed rate structure  for  the  road  industry is set up, the coasting Liner  shipping rates  can continue to be  effectively controlledthrough the medium of voluntary agreements.   (7) It  may be  said  that  the  Railways   and-  Coastal  Liner Shippingthrough voluntary rate agreements which have existed for a great  number
                                   proof years, have taken the initiative in promoting co-ordination.   agreement has been reached between the Railways and Coastal Liner Shipping for thecontinuance  on a  wider basis of  the  existing  conference  arrangements between  them.  The  new  Agreement will continue to  provide for the holding of regular conferences to settle all rate questions of mutual interestand will have as its main object as heretofore,  the promotion of co-opera-tion  and co-ordination between the parties.  Provision will be made  forthe final determination of  any differences which may arise  between theparties by reference to arbitration and the agreement will be for a definite period of five years or for such other time as may be adopted by  parliament for the operation of the new Railway  legislation  which will presumablyfollow the investigation  which the Transport  Advisory Council is  nowundertaking into the claim of the Railway Companies.  The Agreement will operate as from the coming into force of  such legislation.   (8)  Although  it is not practicable at this stage to embrace road hauliersin the voluntary agreement, it is  the  desire of  both the Railways and coastal Liner Shipping, as contemplated in the Report of the transport advisory Council on &quot; Service and  Rates (Coastwise  Shipping),&quot;  that thisAgreement between the Railways and Coastal Liner  Companies should  assoon  as practicable  be extended to and  ultimately embrace road haulageand canal companies.   (9)  In view of the undertaking which the Railway Companies have givento conclude  a  revised agreement  with the Coasting Liner Companies,  theterms of which have  been agreed, the Coasting Liner Companies do  not wish  to raise any objection to  the  acceptance  of the Railway  Companies&apos;proposals as now before  the Transport Advisory Council.ALF. H.  READ,    For  the  Coasting  Liner Companies.  20th February,  1939.STAMP,R. L. WEDGWOOD,J. MILNE,     *  For the Railway  Companies.                            APPENDIX X.MEMORANDUM  SUBMITTED  TO THE  COUNCIL BY  THE RAILWAY COMPANIES                    AND COASTWISE TRAMP SHIPPING.  1. The Railways  and  Coastwise Tramp  Shipping recognise that it isnecessary in the national  interest  that full advantage should  be  taken ofevery form of transport and that this  national objective cannot be attainedif one form of transport is given an undue or unfair advantage over another and if the competition of one with another is permitted to pass the boundsof what is economic and  reasonable.   It should,  therefore, be and is  theobject of the Railways and Coastwise  Tramp Shipping to co-operate as faras possible with a view to eliminating uneconomic competition.  2. With these main principles in mind the two transport services have considered matters of common interest arising out of the proposals of  theRailways for relief from the existing  statutory regulation  of their charges for the  conveyance  of merchandise traffic and the requirements  attachedthereto.  3. In  examining these proposals  full consideration has been given to  theview expressed by the Minister of Transport that &quot; due  regard  must begiven to the ultimate objective of  the co-ordination of all forms  of trans-
                                                                       13                                   6iport &quot;  and the  Railways and Coastwise Tramp Shipping  adhere to theview expressed by the Transport Advisory Council in its Reports on Serviceand Rates  that &quot;it  is  desirable to  establish as  great  a degree pi  co-ordination as possible among the various forms of transport engaged in the carriage of  goods, so  as to ensure that each  form of transport is used  tothe greatest national  advantage &quot; and that through co-ordination  &quot; . .  . .each form of  transport will tend  to carry those traffics to which it is best suited &quot;.  4. There have been several meetings between representatives of CoastwiseTramp Shipping appointed by the Chamber of Shipping  and of the Rail-ways and we should like to place on  record our appreciation of the spiritof mutual understanding and desire to resolve difficulties which both parties have shown.  5. The representatives of Coastwise Tramp Shipping (which represents  no less than three-quarters of the whole  Coasting Trade)  have impressed uponthe  Railways that  their  proposals  for  relief from rates control  presentpeculiar difficulties which do  not apply to any other form of transport andare of vital concern to the Coastwise Tramp  Trade in that        (a) a  &quot; short haul &quot;  by Railway  to the ports forms in the vast    majority  of cases  the only means  of collecting coastwise tramp cargoes,    and,  further, for a large volume of traffic rail presents  the only effective     means  of delivery to the  consumer,       (b) that at the docks themselves access  to and from coastwise tramp     berths is usually only  possible  by rail,  and similarly  the heavy  in-     dustries who are  the principal customers  of  Coastwise Tramp Shipping     have laid out their works for rail despatch and receipt of cargo,  and        (c) a large number of  docks and port  facilities through which coast-     wise tramp cargoes must pass at the beginning and /or end of the voyage     are under the control or  ownership of  the Railways.  Further,  Coastwise  Tramp  Shipping submits that their power to compete with the Railways is strictly limited by  the smallness  of each coastingtramp unit, which compels them to conform  to the economic factor, whilethe Railways with their extensive capital resources are not so limited.  It is these considerations coupled with the knowledge that a large volumeof the traffic from the heavy industries departs or arrives from the minesor  works by rail,  which  causes Coastwise Tramp  Shipping  to  be appre-hensive lest any new  freedom from control  granted to the Railways shouldbe  used to  the  detriment of their branch of transport.  6. The Rallwa3&apos;S recognise the national importance  of preserving coastal shipping and have  given an  assurance to Coastwise Tramp Shipping thatit is not  their intention to use any relief from their  existing rates  control to embark  upon a policy of  cut-throat competition with  Coastal Shippingwith  the recognition  that this would  be  calculated to defeat the commonobject of co-ordination.  The  attitude of Coastwise  Tramp Shipping to  theRailway  proposals has been  very greatly influenced  by  this assurance ofthe Railways.  7. The Railways have  pointed out that under their proposals  as nowamplified and under the terms of the several agreements reached with road transport, iron  and steel, agriculture, the  traders and  other interests,  in-direct safeguards will exist   for Coastwise Tramp Shipping,  particularlyunder the  continued  obligation of  the  Railways to.  provide  reasonablefacilities  and the provision  that their rates shall be &quot; reasonable rates &apos;&quot;with the  right to traders to appeal to a tribunal such as the Railway rates tribunal  for a decision as to  whether a rate  is reasonable or not.   One ofthe considerations to which  it is recommended that the  Tribunal  shouldhave  regard in  considering  the reasonableness of  a railway rate is  &quot; the
existence of any alternative or competitive  transport facilities for  the con-veyance of the merchandise in respect of which the charge is made and thecharges offered  by such alternative transport facilities for the carriage oflike  merchandise &quot;.   The  Railways have further pointed out they haveagreed that the right of a Trader to appeal  to the Railway Rates tribunal to reduce  charges should be retained and  that the Tribunal when consider-ing the reasonableness  of any charge  shall  also  have regard to the  chargemade to other traders for like merchandise if it affects the trader concerned.   8. While the Railways  believe that  these  safeguards  will  afford  toTraders every  opportunity to  continue to  use&apos; Coastwise Tramp  shipping to the full  extent they consider necessary  to  meet their needs,  the Rail-ways do net consider the contention of Coastwise Tramp Shipping for thecontinuance of certain specific safeguards  in their  interests as unreasonable.The Railways  are prepared to see embodied  in the proposed  new  legisla-tion a Clause  modelled on the lines  of Section 39 of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933,  enlarged to cover any  or all rates and charges which are being made  or charged  by the  Railways  in   competition  with  coastalcarriers,  or in respect  of  &quot; short  hauls &quot; to and from the  seaboard.  TheRailways  further agree that  the  new  Clause  should be  framed  so as  toensure the speedy consideration and determination of representations madeby Coastal Shipping in the proceedings before the Railway Rates Tribunal.   9. While not wishing to under-estimate the value of the  continuance ofSection 39 of the 1933 Act,  the representatives of Coastwise Tramp shipping have stressed that        (a) it is  only after  railway rates  on competitive  traffic  are made     and  in operation  and  therefore after traffics have been lost from  sea     to rail that the machinery of investigation can be put into  operation,       (b) the removal of the obligation  upon the Railways  as to pubhea-     tion  of rates would  render  more  difficult  the  ability  of  Coastwise     Shipping to  ascertain the  precise level  of  and  variations in  railway-     rates on competitive traffics,  and to  make  comparisons of one railway     rate with  another, and       (c) there is not  and cannot be available  to Coastal Shipping  the  in-     formation necessary to show  whether  any  railway rate  or rates &quot;are     inadequate having  regard  to  the  cost  of affording the service  or ser-     vices  in respect  of which they  are made  or charged &quot;  a condition     which  must  in any event  be difficult of proof.   The Railways feel strongly that it would be inconsistent with their claim for  greater freedom from  control  that  Coastal  Shipping should  be giventhe  right to challenge  railway rates on competitive traffic before they are put into  operation a right which Coastal Shipping does not possess to-day but are prepared to supply representatives of Coastwise Shipping withall relevant information to enable complaints of charges to be considered and have  agreed to the  setting  up  of  Conference arrangements between them and  Coastwise  Tramp Shipping for  the consideration of all  matters which, in  the  event of inability to reach agreement, can  be referred  tothe  Tribunal under the proposed  new Clause, which  with the rules of the Tribunal. will  enable  discovery of all relevant matters  in  relation to the railway charges to be available.   10.  The Railways and  Coastwise Shipping agree that  fu*&apos;  advantage  ofthese  Conference arrangements should be  taken to  promoting .e  co-operationbetween the two transport services,  and that regular periodical meetings,at least quarterly, shall  be  held to  discuss  rates  and  other matters  of mutual interest.   11.  The  representatives  of Coastwise  Tramp Shipping understand that it  is  proposed that  the  new  legislation  dealing  with  the  railway pro- posals should operate for a trial period of five years, and  it is  recognised that this proposal has the advantage  that, should Coastwise Shipping find

In considering the question remitted to the Council  by  the Minister of Transport in his letter of the 12th December last, we  have considered it necessary to give special attention to the posit;on of the general trading interests as it would be affected by the proposals of the Railways.    2. We have had  the benefit of hearing the views of the Federation  of British Industries, the Traders&apos; Co-ordinating Committee on Transport and the Mansion House Association  on Transport,  and we are indebted to them for the valuable assistance which they have given us in  arriving  at our conclusions.    3. As a  result of  the discussions which  have taken place the representa- tives  of the trading interests agree  to the proposals of the railway com- panies  for  the removal  of statutory restrictions  on  their  charges  for merchandise traffic, subject to the conditions set out in the  following paragraphs, and to the exception mentioned  in  paragraph  11.   4. Regular periodical meetings will  be  held  between the railway com- panies and the recognised  trading associations  for  the  discussion of rail- way charges  and matters  relating  thereto.   The  railways  have always welcomed the opportunity of discussing such matters with trading associa- tions  or individual traders, but in  their view the  needs of individual  traders will best be met by a  less formal and  prescribed procedure.   5. If the railways  propose   any  general  increase of existing charges, endeavours will be made at such meetings to come to an agreement,  and if agreement  is  not so  reached, the  matter  will  stand  referred to  the Tribunal,  which,  after hearing-both sides will fix  what  it considers are reasonable  charges.

If,  however, unforeseen  disadvantages of a serious character to Coastal  Shipping result from the new legislation,  it is  understood  thatCoastwise  Shipping would be free to call for amending legislation at any time before the conclusion of the five year period.   12.  Subject to  the arrangements and  understanding between  the twotransport services  outlined  in  the previous paragraphs,  and to  a  satis-factory arrangement being made for the coal industry, Coastwise TrampShipping agrees  not to  take exception .to  the Railway  Companies&apos;  pro-posals as now before the Transport Advisory Council.

    6.  The railways shall, after such meetings, give at least a month&apos;s notice of  any proposed general increase in existing  charges.   After the  expiry of  the notice  the  railways  may  charge  the  new charges, but  shall immediately  recoup the traders for any overpayments made,  if,  after reference to the Tribunal, that body fixes lower charges than those  made by the railways.   7. If the railways wish to make an increase  in individual charges they shall  give  at least one  month&apos;s  notice to the  traders concerned,  and the increase will operate from the expiration of the notice.  The traders may refer the  matter for discussion  to the  appropriate  periodical  meeting,  or if they prefer they may refer it  direct to the Tribunal.   The  provision for recoupment as in paragraph 6  will apply.   S. The right  of any trader  to  appeal  to the Tribunal  to  reduce charges will be retained.   9. It is  further agreed that  in determining whether or not  a  charge  is reasonable  the  Tribunal  shall have  regard  (inter  alia)  to the  following considerations:          (i)  whether or not the charge is detrimental to the public interest;        (i;)  variations in  the internal value of currency;        (iii) the cost of affording the service  or  services in respect  of which     the charge  is made;        (iv) the existence of any alternative or competitive transport facili-     ties for the conveyance of  the  merchandise  in  respect . of  which the     charge is made  and the charges offered  by such alternative  transport     facilities  for the carriage  of  like  merchandise.        (v) the effect  of  the charge on the financial position of the parties     concerned,  either generally or individually;       (vi)  the charge made  to  other traders  for like  merchandise  if  it     affects the trader concerned.   10.  If any  addition  is made  to the  Tribunal  in  order to  give  repre- sentation  to road hauliers or any other form of transport, a corresponding addition to the representation  of traders should be  made.   11.  It  is  part of the  proposals of the railways  that they should be relieved of the  present  statutory requirements  in regard to the  publica- tion  of their charges-.    The railway  companies intimate  that they  are prepared to accept any  obligation with  regard  to publication of  charges which is made applicable to all  forms of transport.   On the  other hand they submit that it is inequitable to  continue an obligation  which is con- fined to the railways with  the  sole  exception  of canal  carriage  charges where canal companies act as statutory canal carriers.   The railways state that it is their intention  to  make their charges known on appropriate commercial lines to all interested parties,  and they further undertake to furnish to associations of traders, on request, full  information as to the  charges applicable to the carriage of the traffics in  which they are interested.   The traders take note  of the intention of the railways,  as set out above, to give information as to the charges,  but this proposal is not  satisfactory from the traders&apos; point of view.   Only very few of the trade  associations have an organisation  whose objects include matters of this kind, or which are suited  to deal with them.   Incidentally,  also, unless  every member of a  trade  is  within the four  walls of  an  association,  under  the proposal made it would not be possible for the association to obtain informationof  any charges made  to  competitors who  were not inside the association.
                                                                       to f*                                                                       * O Q                                   65In  many cases overlapping takes place between traders  as to their par-ticular operations, and therefore,  a particular trader would not be eligible,though carrying on  certain competitive  operations,  for  membership  ofthe  association.   In  a number  of industries  there  are  no  associationsavailable.  The trading interests point  out that in considering whether a charge is reasonable the Tribunal is to have regard to the charge  quoted to othertraders for  like merchandise if it affects the trader concerned.   In  their view, therefore, it is  essential  that  a trader  should  be able to have  this information before considering whether he wishes to approach the  Tribunalor  not, and it is unreasonable that he should  be  compelled  to  apply  inthe dark without  full  information  on  this point.  It is the  view of the traders,  therefore,  that  publication of the charges should remain as  at  present,  but  the  existing  classification  may  beremodelled  and simplified.   12.  The trading interests are submitting  a separate  memorandum givingtheir observations  on the Joint  Memorandum dated 6th  February by theRailways and  the Liaison Committee on Road Transport Rates.

APPENDIX  XII.MEMORANDUM SUBMITTTED TO THE COUNCIL BY THE  RAILWAY COMPANIES             AND THE BRITISH IRON AND  STEEL FEDERATION.  1.   In  considering the  question  remitted  to  us  by  the Minister  ofTransport in his letter of the 12th December last,  we have felt it necessaryto give special attention to  the position of the  Iron and  Steel industry as it would be affected by the proposals of the Railways.  2. The  representatives of the  Iron  and  Steel Industry  have impressed upon us the fact  that their industry is dependent upon railway  transport to an  altogether  exceptional  degree.  It is  their claim that so far as ironand steel is concerned the  Railways are still  to all  intents a monopoly,and that the extent  to which they can avail themselves of road transport for the carriage of raw  materials, fuel or semi-manufactured and  finished products  is  still  negligible.   It was,  in fact,  stated on  behalf of theIron and  Steel Industry  that not more than 3 per cent, of their tonnageis capable of transference to road transport.   3. The  Railways  do   not contest this  view in  general, though  theysubmit that road transport is  used  in  some  degree for the carriage  of semi-manufactured  products,  and  freely for  the  carriage  of  fully-manu-factured  articles.  Nevertheless, they admit  that the  case of the  Ironand Steel  Industry  is  a special one,  and  entitles the  industry to  special treatment.   4. We  are impressed  by  the fact that here too,  as  in the  case  of competing  forms of transport,  the  basis  for  any  satisfactory   solutionlies in closer contact and more deliberate  co-operation between  the twointerests concerned.  It appears  to us desirable that there should be regular
   and formal  meetings between the two interests,  to  be held  quarterly or   more  frequently, as  necessary,  at  which  all  disputed  questions brought   up  by  either  side  may come  under discussion, whether  affecting the   industry as a  whole,  or individual firms,  reporting  through  the central   organisation.  This  is not intended to restrict present practice  of individual   negotiations.    5. Matters brought up at these  meetings should be  settled  as far  as  possible  by  agreement  and  both parties undertake  that  they will  give  full  information to  the  other on all points  relevant  to  the matter under  discussion.    6. So  far as  possible arrangements will be made for  any general changes  to operate  from the same dates and over  the same  period  of time, not  less  than six months, as for periods of stabilised prices  approved by the  Import Duties  Advisory Committee from time  to  time:.    In order to give  effect to  the  foregoing the  Railways  will  give notice,  not less  than one month  in advance, of any general proposal to raise  or  lower  railway  charges  and  will give  opportunity  for  consultation  and  discussion.    7.  It is necessary that, failing agreement, there should be some machinery  of reference to  an impartial body or Tribunal  for decision  or settlement.    In the case of railway  charges we propose the  following:          (a)  The  rates  applicable to  the  raw  materials,  fuel  and semi-      manufactured and finished products of  the iron  and  steel trade to      be such  reasonable  rates  as  the Railway  Companies,  after the  said      consultation with the industry, may fix.        (b) Any case of difference or  dispute on the question  of reasonable-     ness to be decided by reference  to an agreed Tribunal.        (c) This Tribunal  in deciding such  cases would be  empowered to     have regard to the public interest, the charges made to  other traders,     the  competitive  conditions and  other relevant considerations.   The establishment  of such a  procedure would need legislation,  and we propose that an  appropriate clause should form  part  of the  Bill repealing the present restrictions on railway charges.   8.  It  is  evident that if the  proposals  which  we are  putting forward in regard to the  co-ordination of all forms of transport are  approved, fresh and  amending legislation will be required  as  soon  as a  scheme for a correlated rates  structure  and  a common form  of  rate control has been brought into  shape.   Under  our proposals this  development  should  not be delayed beyond five  years,  and  might  be  far enough  advanced  for legislation  even  before that period.   We  therefore propose  that the Act should in  the first  instance  run only for  a  maximum  period  of  five years.  This  proposal has  the further advantage that industries in  the position of the Iron and  Steel  Industry,  if they  find the Act  operates in any way  to  their disadvantage,  will  have an  opportunity  presented  to them within a comparatively short  period of time of calling for appropriateamendments or further safeguards  in  the new Act.   If  the disadvantagesshould be  of a serious  character, which having  regard  to  the  safeguardsafforded we do not anticipate, the industry would of course be free to call for amending legislation at any date before the conclusion of  the five-year period.  9. Subject to  the arrangements outlined in  the previous paragraphs,which  have the approval of all the parties concerned,  we believe that theeffect  of the  changes  proposed will  be  to  ensure  closer  contact, and

MEMORANDUM SUBMITTED TO  THE COUNCIL BY THE RAILWAY AND                     AGRICULTURAL  REPRESENTATIVES .   (1) We have considered all matters of common interest arising out of theproposals of the main line Railway Companies  that the existing statutoryregulation of the  charges  for  the conveyance  of  merchandise traffic by railway together with the requirements attached  thereto, including classi-fication, publication  and  undue preference,  should be  repealed,  bearing that mind the view expressed by  the  Minister of  Transport that due regardmust be given to the ultimate objective  of the co-ordination of all formsof transport.   (2) We have had  meetings with the  National  Farmers&apos;  Uriicn whichwas  representative of the  industry generally,  and  we should like  to placeon record our appreciation of  the  valuable  assistance which they  havegiven us  in  our deliberations.   (3) We adhere to the  view expressed by the Transport Advisory  Councilin their report  on Service  and  Rates  that  &quot;it  is  desirable to establishas great a  degree  of co-ordination  as  possible  among  the  various formsof transport engaged in the carriage of goods,  so  as to ensure that eachform of transport is  used  to the greatest national advantage.&quot;   (4) We agree that  co-ordination cannot  be effected  between  transportsystems upon the basis of  applying to other forms  of transport the presentrailway rates structure  with  its  elaborate classification  restrictions  and obligations,  and in our  view the principle which  the Transport AdvisoryCouncil&apos;s Report  on  Service  and  Rates suggests should be applied in arriving at a  rates  structure for  Road  Transport (see  page  4  of that report) is a  sound one and should be  applied when rate  structures  forother forms of transport are under consideration, namely, that rates shouldbe arrived at in relation solely  to factors affecting the particular form oftransport employed and not artificially linked with rates by other formsof transport.   (5) In  approaching the  consideration  of  the Railways&apos;  proposals  therepresentatives of the National  Farmers&apos;  Union  wish it  to be understoodthat they could not  support any  scheme of co-ordination which did not,inter alia,  aim at securing adequate alternative facilities of transport  and secure and maintain  the following principles:        (a) Unfettered  right of the trader  to select the  form  of transport    he  approves  and which  is  most  convenient  and economic  for his    purpose.      (6) Undiminished right of the trader to undertake, as under existing    law, his own transport for long or short distances or in respect of  any     category of traffic.co-ordination between the Iron and Steelconsequent  advantage  to the  industrialwhole.

         (c) That the  stimulus  of legitimate  competition  between  various      forms of transport  is free from restriction.         (d) That no obstruction is placed in the way of the trader securing      his  due  share  of  the benefits  from  progress in  the  direction  of      mechanical invention or  otherwise.         (e) The  amendment of existing  law  necessary  to  implement the      foregoing conditions.    The  representatives of the Railways  take note  of this pronouncement  and in their view the first four principles are already secured under the  existing law  and will remain secured under their own proposals,  but they  would not oDject to any amendment of the  existing law found necessary  to  make  that position  clear.    (6) The representatives of the National Farmers&apos; Union also desire  to  emphasise their view that the  Act and  &quot; Case Law &quot; superimposed thereon  governing the present licensing regulations applicable to road ireight trans-  port unduly limit the freedom  of trade  upon the roads.   They  find them-  selves  in complete agreement with paragraph  340 of  the Final  Report  of  the  Royal Commission on  Transport,  which reads as follows: &quot; We think that applications for hauliers  licences  need be considered from two aspects only,  and that the Area Traffic  Commissioners should have  regard only to:          (a)  the fitness of the vehicle;        (b) the  wages  and conditions of service of  persons employed  in     connection therewith.&quot; In their view, therefore,  the Road and  Rail Traffic Act,  1933,  should be amended to permit  any haulier to ply for  hire upon the roads provided he is prepared to observe the statutory  provisions  affecting safety,  hours and wages, etc., and the necessary relief  in this respect should be included in the legislation to give effect  to the proposals of the  Railways.  The representatives of the Railways are unable to accept this  view, but draw attention to the  offer which they have made to the Road Interests as to the  withdrawal  of their opposition to road licences for  a period of two years.  This offer, however,  does  not appear  to the  representatives of the National Farmers&apos;  Union to go far enough to meet their objection to the licensing provisions of the 1933 Act.  (7) After a full discussion  of  the conditions affecting agricultural trafficit was agreed  to report to the Committee as follows:        (a) Having regard  to  the  views   which have been placed before    them the Railways have  agreed not to press for repeal of the existing    law relating to their own conditions  of  carriage and  are prepared to    continue to accept the obligation to obtain the approval of the Railway    Rates Tribunal to any modifications which may  subsequently be found    desirable in order to secure uniformity of conditions of carriage for all    forms  of  transport  until  such  time  as  a comprehensive scheme    embracing  all forms of transport  has  been devised.      (6) We consider that existing rights  of railway users  in regard to the   provision of reasonable facilities should be continued.      (c) We also consider that  the Railway Companies should  continue   to give through rates as reasonable facilities.     (d) We recommend  that the  Railways and the National Farmers&apos;   Union should set  up a joint  committee for the  purpose of discussing   matters of  common interest,  including complaints in regard  to  rates   and charges both generally and for particular traffics.
130      The detailed arrangements  of  this  Committee&apos;s functions  would    provide:             (i) That the Railway Representatives would  supply the  Union        Representatives with all relevant information to enable complaints        of charges to  be  considered.           (ii) That the Committee should be  constituted for a minimum        period of five years.  (8)  The representatives of the Railways have drawn particular attentionto their proposal (set out in their Memorandum to the Transport AdvisoryCouncil on 13th January, 1939), that their  rates must be reasonable,  andthat in case of dispute a  Tribunal. such as the Railway Rates  Tribunalshall decide whether a rate is reasonable or  not.  They have further proposed:         (a) If  at any  time  the Railway Companies  wish to introduce a    general increase in charges for agricultural traffic, they  should  in  the    first place discuss their proposals, and the grounds  for proposing such    an increase,  at  the Joint  Committee.   In the  event   of the  repre-    sentatives of the National Farmers&apos; Union on  the Joint Committee    being unable to  agree with the Railway Companies at such  a  con-    ference to the proposed  increase, the  Railway  Companies would  give     not less than one month&apos;s notice  of their intention  to  introduce  the     increase, and both parties agree to refer to the  Tribunal the question     of the reasonableness  of the proposed  new charges, and the  Tribunal     should whenever possible  give its decision  within  one  month  of the     date of  the application.       If the Tribunal did not give  its decision before the end of the period     of notice given  by  the  Railway Companies, the Railway Companies     would be entitled to introduce the  increases on the  proposed  date,  but    the Tribunal would  have power to make its decision retrospective to    that date.       (6)  In  the  case of increases  other than general increases,  the Rail-    ways  undertake to give the traders concerned  one month&apos;s  notice of    any increase and  to send a copy of the notice to the National Farmers&apos;     Union.  It will  be  open  to  such traders or the  National  Farmers&apos;    Union, if they so desire, to refer the matter to  the  Joint Committee    for discussion under the normal procedure.  (See (a) above.)       (c) Proposals for  increases  of  railway  charges  arising under   any     suggested  Road-Rail agreement  shall  also be discussed  b3&apos; the Joint    Committee  referred to  in paragraph (a) above.       (d) The Railway Companies  would be prepared to furnish all  appro-    priate information to enable a trader cr the National Farmers&apos;  Union    to place before the Tribunal their views on the  reasonableness  of  any    charges at issue.   (9) The right of any trader to appeal to  the Tribunal to reduce charges should be  retained.   (10) In determining whether or not a charge is reasonable the Tribunalshall  have regard to the following  considerations:         (i)  whether or not the charge is detrimental to  the public interest;       (ii) variations in the value of currency;       (iii) the adequacy of the  charge having regard to the cost of affording    the  service  or services in respect of which the  charge is made;       (iv) the  existence  of  any  alternative  or  competitive  transport    facilities for the conveyance of  the merchandise in respect of which  the    charge is made and  the  charges  offered by such  alternative  transport    facilities for the carriage of like merchandise;
      (v) the effect  of  such variations on  the financial position of the    parties  concerned,  either  generally or individually;      (vi) the rates quoted to competing traders for like merchandise.  (n)  If any additions  are  made to  the Tribunal in order to give repre-sentation  to road hauliers or any other form of transport, correspondingadditions  to the  representation of traders  should be made.  (12)  It is  the intention of  the Railways to make their charges known onappropriate  commercial  lines to all interested parties; they further under-take to furnish, on request, to the National Farmers&apos; Union full informationas to the charges applicable to the  carriage of the traffics in which theyare directly or indirectly concerned.  (13)  Subject to the conditions mentioned in this Memorandum, the repre-sentatives of the National  Farmers&apos; Union are  prepared to  support theRailways in their claim  for the removal of the restrictions on  their charges for merchandise  traffic as proposed in their Memoranda to  the Minister ofTransport dated  23rd November and Sth December, 1938, respectively.R.

In principle and subject to appropriate safeguards the Mining Associationdo  not object to the conferring on the  railways of  such liberty  as mayenable them to compete on equal terms with  other forms of  transport fortraffics not tied to the railways.  They realise  that by securing such  traffic the railways may better their revenue position.  The Association wish, however, to emphasise the unique position of thecoal industry in the  degree of its dependence on  rail  transport.  The CoalExport Trade  is absolutely tied to  the railways  and 95 per cent, of the inland trade is  also tied.  In these circumstances the industry is naturallyanxious that it should not be prejudiced by any modification of the statutory control of railway charges.  The Association understand that the railway companies do not seek any alteration in the law relating  to their obligations  to provide reasonablefacilities, through  rates, or standard  conditions  of carriage.  In  the following paragraphs are set out the safeguards which the CoalIndustry  considers must be  provided  if the  existing  statutory control ofrailway rates and charges is to  be removed:    1. Arrangements should be made for periodical National Conferences, atleast  quarterly,  between  representatives  of  all  the  Railway  companies of Great Britain and of  the Mining Association of Great Britain.  In  addition,  arrangements should be made  for District Conferences atleast quarterly between Railway Officers and representatives of the DistrictCoalowners&apos;  Associations on  local questions.&apos; Either  party should have the right to  ask for a special meeting of theNational  or District  Conferences to be held at any time  upon giving seven days&apos; notice.
  All matters for discussion between the  Railway Companies and the CoalIndustry relating to general alterations in charges for coal traffic should inthe first instance be referred to the National Conference.  All matters affecting charges for coal traffic other than general alterations in charges should in  the  first  instance be  discussed  at  the District Con-ferences and then be referred to the National Conference.  The deliberations at such Conferences  should in no circumstances pre-judice,  or  be quoted in  evidence  at,  any hearing  before  the  StatutoryTribunal which is proposed in paragraph 2 below.  No reduction of charges in favour of a particular trader or a  section ofthe trade arranged at a District Conference should become  operative untilapproved and agreed  at a National  Conference, or failing such  agreement,determined by the Tribunal.   Any  special rates  agreed by  the RailwayCompanies with  a trader  for his inter-departmental  traffic need not, how-ever, be referred to the District or National Conferences, and the RailwayCompanies should continue to be at liberty  to  make such arrangements without reference to the  Tribunal.  2. A  Statutory Tribunal should be set up, with powers to decide matterson  which  agreement cannot  be  reached  at  the District and  NationalConferences.  This  Tribunal  should be so  constituted as to ena.ble speedy decisions tobe secured on practical lines.  It should consist  of three permanent members(of whom  one should be a lawyer who should act as Chairman) and fourother members representative  of  trading  interests, who should  be selected from a panel with due regard to the  kind of question to be  dealt with at the particular hearing.  3. If at any time the  Railway Companies  wish  to introduce a general increase in charges for coal traffic, they should in the first place discuss their proposals and the grounds for requiring  such  an increase at the NationalConference.  In the event of the  Mining Association  refusing to agree withthe  Railway  Companies  at such  a Conference  to  the proposed increase,the  Railway  Companies  should  give notice  to the  Association of their intention  to apply to the Tribunal  for liberty to introduce such increase.If,  after  receiving  such  notice,  the  Association  does  not  withdraw  itsopposition within fourteen clays,  the Railway Companies&apos;  application tothe  Tribunal should  proceed  and the Tribunal  should give  its decisionwithin  one month of the  date  of  the application,  or such other period asmay be determined by the Minister of Transport.  4. No increase which is  the subject of a reference to the Tribunal  should become operative until  the Tribunal has made its  award  and  then  only from such date  as the Tribunal  shall  consider appropriate.  5. The Mining Association should  be  at liberty at any time to apply fora general reduction of charges on coal traffic, and  any  trader or body oftraders for a reduction of a particular charge or charges on such  traffic.Any such application should  be  dealt with by the  procedure specified inparagraphs 1 and 2 above and the same rules of procedure should appnyin the  case of an application for a reduction as for an increase.   6.  If a  trader, or body of traders,  be of  opinion  that  the railway charges in operation in connection with coal traffic, competing with his, or their, traffic, or  the  railway  charges proposed therefor are  unduly low,or that the charges on his,  or  their  own, traffic are  unduly  high,  andthat the fair and equitable distribution  of trade as  determined  from timeto time&apos; by the statutory  bodies  established by the  Coal Mines  Act,  1930,is,  or may be,  affected thereby,  he, or they  shall  have the right to refer the  matter to the  District and  National Conferences, and, failing  agree-ment, to have the matter referred to the  Tribunal, which shall have power
 to grant such relief as they  may deem requisite,  whether by an increase in the charges for  the  competing traffic complained  of, or by a reduction of the charges on the complainants traffic, or both.   The words  &quot; railway charges &quot;  are to be understood  as  meaning for this  purpose  the net charges  effectively  in operation,  i.e.,  after  taking account of any  rebates, allowances, or discounts.   7.  The  onus of  justifying  before the Tribunal any proposed alteration in charges for coal traffic,  whether by way of an increase or a reduction of such charges,  should be  on the party applying for the alteration.   The railway  companies  should,   however,  be  under  an  obligation  to furnish promptly to an  applicant  for an  alteration in charges  such in- formation as he  may reasonably  require to  enable him to place his  views before the Tribunal.   8.  The  legislation proposed should  specify  the considerations to which the Tribunal  should have  regard  in  determining the  reasonableness,  or otherwise,  of  charges in connection with all coal  traffic, or  any section thereof.   Where  the  question is the  reasonableness of  a  particular  charge,  or class  of charges, it should  be  necessary  for  the Tribunal  to  have  regard both  to the general level of  charges for  the carriage of coal  by rail and to the charges  made  for the transport of competing coal traffic by rail or otherwise.  The mere fact that  a reduction of charges is  necessary  to enable the  railway companies to  meet  the  competition  of  other forms of transport should not  be  conclusive evidence  that the charge  is not unreasonably low.  If any such reduction  would affect the relative position of different  coal  producing  districts in  a particular market the Association must  point  out  that the statutory bodies set up  under  the Coal Mines Acts,  1930 and 193S, have duties to perform in the regulation of the supply and sale  of  coal.  The  Association  cannot concur in any alteration  in the charges for coal traffic which,  of themselves, might involve the  diversion of trade  from one  district  to another,  or from one  producer  to  another, so as  to  affect the fair and  equitable  distribution of trade as determined from  time to time by these  statutory bodies.                N   Where  the general level  of charges  is in question, the Tribunal should have  regard to  the charges  which  the traffic can  bear,  and to  whether the proposed charges would tend  to reduce or increase the volume of such traffic, as well  as  to the  cost to  the Railway  Companies  of  operating such  traffic, and the effect of  the  proposed  alteration on the revenue  of the Railway Companies.   The Tribunal  should  not  have power to approve any increase in charges for coal traffic to make good losses incurred in:        (a)  competing with other forms  of  transport,  and       (6)  ancillary businesses.   9. The  Railway  Companies should continue to treat export coal  as  a special class,  entitled to exceptional  rates,   and  when  charges on  such traffic  are being considered  by the Tribunal it  should  have regard to prevailing and anticipated market conditions,  and to the  Dock and other Charges upon  such  traffic on/or before shipment.   10.  The Railway  Companies should furnish the  Mining Association with particulars of  all proposed  alterations  of  Charges for coal traffic, and of their  grounds  for applying for  such alterations,  at  least fourteen  days before these are  referred to the District and  National Conferences.   11.  The Railway Companies  should  continue the present   position inregard  to special  charges, services and facilities granted for valuable con-sideration  and all existing  siding Tebates, and do  nothing which wouldalter the position of the trader  under Sections 34  and 61 of the railways act, 1921.
  12. The  Railway  Companies  should continue, the  existing practice asregards Group Rates.  13. The Railway Companies should continue to quote Through Rates.  14. Traders should continue to  have the unrestricted  right to use  any means of transport  for their traffic.  15. The necessity  for stability of charges in connection with coal  trafficshould be recognised and proposals for the  stabilisation  of  such chargesover a defined period should come within the competence of the Conferenceand of the Statutory Tribunal.  16. In view of the  experimental  nature  of  the  Railway  Companies&apos;proposals, it  is suggested that the above arrangements,  and any  legisla-tion  necessary to carry them into effect,  should  be operative for a  periodof five years only.  10th February,  1939.                             APPENDIX XV.       MEMORANDUM  SUBMITTED TO THE  COUNCIL BY THE  RAILWAY     REPRESENTATIVES ON  THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COAL  INDUSTRY.   The Railway Representatives  have most carefully  considered the Memo-randum  of the Mining Association  dated  10th February.  In their view itdoes  not afford a  possible basis for agreement.   The Railway Representatives  draw attention in particular to the follow-ing items in the Memorandum of the Mining  Association:         (i)  No  reduction  of charges  in  favour  of a  particular trader or a    section of the  trade arranged  at a District Conference should become    operative  until approved and agreed  at&quot; a  National Conference, or    failing such agreement, determined by the Tribunal.   This proposal deprives the Railway Companies of their existing limited powers for the reduction of rates,  and  places  them in a  much  moreunfavourable  position  than they at present occupy.   The Railways could  not  accept any  such proposal.       (ii) No increase which  is  the subject of a  reference to the  Tribunal    should become operative until  the  Tribunal  has made its award, and    then only from such date as the Tribunal  shall consider appropriate.   This proposal would  make an increase  of  railway charges inoperative,no matter how fully discussed  with the  District or National Conference,until  after it had  been agreed  by the Conference  or sanctioned by theTribunal.  The Railways have made  it  clear in discussion, with  the  Coal Tradeand  Traders  generally  that  they  could  not regard such  a restriction as any improvement on existing conditions.   They are therefore unableto accept it  as consistent with  the liberty which  they are claiming.       (Hi) A  Statutory  Tribunal should be set up,  with powers  to decide    matters  on which agreement   cannot  be  reached  at the  District and    National  Conferences.       This Tribunal should be so constituted  as  to enable speedy  decisions    to be secured on practical lines.  It should consist of three permanent    members (of whom one  should be  a lawyer  who should act  as Chair-    man) and four other  member  representative of trading interests, who    should be selected from a panel with due regard to  the kind of  ques-    tion  to  be  dealt  with  at the  particular  hearing.   This appears to  contemplate  a Legal Tribunal of seven members, fourat least  of whom would be  &quot; representative  of  trading  interests.&quot;   Such
a  mixed  body is unfairly  weighted  against  the Railways,  and  havingregard  to its  cumbrous size is most unsuitable for  enabling  &quot; speedydecisions  to be secured.&quot;--  The Railways canot  see their  way to accept a Tribunal so constituted.  Paragraph 6  gives any trader the right to object to the charges actually paid or proposed  to be paid on coal  traffic competing with his traffic  onthe ground  that those  charges affect &quot; the fair and  equitable distributionof trade  as determined from time to  time by the statutory bodies estab-lished by the Coal Mines Act, 1930.&quot;  The  Railways submit that this claim  would  confer  on the trader  theright to act in the name of the Central  Consultative Conference with or without the consent  of that body.   They are of  opinion that  this  is unreasonable and that the merits of  the  case  are fully  met by the  rightof the  trader  to  plead the  rates quoted  to his competitors elsewhere asa ground  of unreasonableness.  There are several other important features in the- Memorandum of theMining  Association which the Railways cannot accept, but in view of thespecial differences indicated  above it is perhaps unnecessary to take theseup in detail.

APPENDIX XVI.     MEMORANDUM  OF EVIDENCE SUBMITTED  TO THE  COUNCIL  BY THE                       BRITISH ROAD FEDERATION.                Regulation  of the Road Haulage  Industry.   1.  The Background of &quot; Control.&quot; The problem arising from the corn- petition of an &quot; uncontrolled &quot; road haulage industry with a &quot; controlled &quot; railway  system received a  good deal of publicity during the  ig2o&apos;s, and, following the Report of the Royal Commission on Transport, 1928-31,  and the Report of the Salter Conference,  1932, the last decade has shown a rapid expansion in  the statutory &quot; control &quot;  of road haulage.  2. Complaints against the Road Haulage Industry. Ten years  ago  thechief  complaints against the  road haulage  industry were:        (i) Hours of Work. It was alleged that the hours worked by drivers    were  frequently excessive.      (ii) Wages and   Conditions. Wages  and conditions  of  work v/ere    unregulated and in certain cases were said to be very bad.      (iii) Speed Limits. The maximum speed  limits for  goods vehicles    were said to be disregarded with impunity in many instances.      (iv) Mechanical Fitness. A proportion of road haulage vehicles were    stated to be mechanically unfit  for use on the roads.      (v) Insurance against  Third Party Risks. There was no legal obliga-   tion for motor vehicles to be insured  against third-party risks.      (vi) Taxation. It was  claimed that the  contribution  of  motor   vehicles by way of taxation was inadequate in relation  to the  cost of   the roads.      (vii) Expansion  of Road Haulage  Industry. It was alleged  that   entry of irresponsible and undesirable elements  into  the road haulage   industry  was completely uncontrolled,  and  that  the  small  capital   required  to enter  the  industry  after the   development  of  the hire-
    purchase system  encouraged an unwise expansion in the number  of    public  haulage vehicles, and consequently  led  to  the reckless cutting    of road rates.      (viii) Road Haulage Rates. Road haulage rates were uncontrolled,    a fact  which was said  to operate unduly against  the interests of the    railways and  of  the  stabler road hauliers.  3. Legal Action  to Remedy  Complaints. These  complaints have  beenremedied as follows :        (i) Hours  of  work. Under  Section  19  of  the Road  Traffic  Act,    1930, hours  of drivers are limited  to eleven out of the  twenty-four,    with a maximum  continuous  period of five and a  half  hours.  The    Minister of Transport may, however, after referring the matter to the    Industrial Court for advice,  vary  the hours  laid down  in  the  Act,    and in fact  drivers  of &quot; A &quot;  and  &quot; B &quot; licensed&apos; vehicles  are  thus    allowed to work  up to a maximum of twelve hours on two days each    week.   Certain concessions  have been granted to &quot; C &quot; licence holders    at special periods.      Section 16  of  the Road and Rail  Traffic  Act, 1933,  provides  for    records to be kept  showing  the times at  which  every driver  and    attendant of  a goods  vehicle began and  ended  work, particulars of    his intervals  of rest and details of journeys made  and goods carried.      (ii) Wages and Conditions. Section 32 of the Road and Rail Traffic    Act, 1933, applied the provisions relating  to wages and conditions of    work of persons employed on  road passenger vehicles, as set out in    Section 93 of the Road Traffic  VI,  1030, to drivers and attendants    of  goods  vehicles, laying  down  that their  wages  and conditions of    employment  should  be  not  less favourable  than  those  applying to    contracts with Government  Departments.  In the  event of dispute,    the Minister of Labour had to refer the matter to  the Industrial^ Court.     Under Section  8  (2)  of the  Road  and  Rail Traffic Act,  1933,  the     observance  of the provisions  of  Section  93  of the Road Traffic  Act,     1930,  was made, a condition of every &quot; A &quot; and  &quot; B &quot; licence.       A more comprehensive measure, applying specifically to road  haul-    age vehicles, is  the Road Haulage Wages Act,  1938.  This provides    for statutory wage rates,  based  on  recommendations of  Area Wages    Boards, to  be paid to all  drivers and attendants employed  on  &quot; A  &quot;    and &quot; B &quot;  licensed  vehicles,  while measures  were also  laid  down to    secure  fair  remuneration for all drivers employed  on  &quot; C &quot; licensed    vehicles.  The observance  of  fair wages  is to  become  a  condition of    holding a &quot; C   licence, just as failure to pay the  statutory rates of    wages to   A &quot;  and &quot; B &quot; workers renders  a road haulier liable to  a    fine and  the  loss of his  licence to  operate.       (iii) Speed  Limits. Speed  limits  of  all  motor  vehicles  were laid    down  in  the  First Schedule of the  Road  Traffic  Act, 1930,  and were    amended in the First Schedule  of the Road  Traffic Act, 1934.   The    maximum speed allowed to goods  vehicles under two and a half tons     unladen weight is 30 m.p.h., but goods vehicles of two and a half tons     and over unladen weight  are  restricted  to  a speed  of 20 m.p.h., in     spite  of  the fact that modern  vehicles of over this  weight can be     driven with reasonable safety at speeds up to 30 m.p.h.       (iv) Mechanical Fitness. Under  Section  8  of the  Road  and Rail     Traffic Act,  1933, it is a condition of every goods vehicle licence that     the vehicles be maintained  in a fit and serviceable  condition.  Examiners     have been appointed by the Minister of Transport, and every examiner     is  authorised, under  Sections 17  and 18 of  this  Act, to  enter  and     inspect any  goods vehicle, detain  the vehicle and  enter premises on     which he has reason to believe that a vehicle is kept, and, if  necessary.
   prohibit the use of a vehicle on the road, until its defects are remedied.   Examiners also have powers to weigh a vehicle, laden  or unladen.     (v) Insurance  against Third-Party Risks. Part  II wf  the  Road   Traffic  Act of 1930  made it compulsory  in respect  of every vehicle   to  insure  against  third-party risks as  to personal injuries,  including   claims by  passengers riding in the vehicle in pursuance of a contract   of  employment.   Any  driver may be required by a police  constable   to give his name and address and the name and address of the owner   of  the vehicle and produce a certificate of insurance, or alternatively   undertake to  produce it, within five days, at a specified police station.     (vi) Taxation. A tax of 4d. per gallon on petrol was introduced in   the 1928 Budget to provide the finance for the rating relief provisions   of the Local Government Act, 1929, from which the railways benefited   materially.  One  of the grounds on  which  the Chancellor  of the  Exchequer justified this was that &quot; it is the  duty of  the State to hold  the balance even between road and rail.&quot;    In  1931,  the petrol tax  was increased  from 4d. to 6d., and again  from 6d. to 8d. in the  Emergency Budget of September of that  year.  The then Chancellor  of the Exchequer stated oh the occasion of the  first increase,  &quot; I  have never liked the  oil  duty . .  .  but the  stern  necessity of the  present emergency, and  that alone, compels me to  make use of it for the time  being.  I should regard  this addition of  2d.  as having  a claim  for remission when  we are  in  a position to  remit taxation.&quot;    On the  occasion  of the second increase,  he  said,  &quot; I  must confess that I regret  the  necessity  of taxing further a com-  commodity  which is  so important  to  modern  transport,  but the needs of  the  moment are  imperative.&quot;    Nevertheless,  when  the  country&apos;s  finances improved,  the  claims of motor vehicle owners to a remission  of the petrol tax  were  entirely overlooked.   The Finance Act of 1933  followed the recommendation of the Salter  Conference  by increasing taxation on the larger goods vehicles, and  particularly on Diesel vehicles, which at that time paid only id. per  gallon tax on their fuel.   The differential  taxation on  Diesel  vehicles was removed  by  the Finance  Act of 1935, when the tax on Diesel oil for  road  vehicles was  increased from  id. to 8d. per  gallon, the same rate as the petrol tax.   However, when Diesel  oil is used for railway  locomotives,  it pays only id. per gallon tax.   In the  Budget  of 1938, a further id. per  gallon was imposed on both petrol  and Diesel  oil  used for road  vehicles,  making the  new total gd. per gallon.   The yield of  motor taxation in the current  year has thus risen to a, figure estimated to  amount to   88,000,000,  which compares with a yield of  24,518,000 in the year 1927-8,  while the annual cost of the roads remains approximately the same as in  1927-8, viz., a little  less than   60,000,000.    The  contribution from  goods vehicles alone  has increased over  the same period from   8,165,000  to  31,500,000.   (vii) Expansion  of  Road  Haulage Industry. Strict regulation of the expansion of the road haulage industry was effected  by the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, &quot; an Act to make provision for regulating the carriage  of  goods on roads by motor vehicles  ...&quot;   A licence  must be obtained  from the Area  Licensing Authority for all goods vehicles either an &quot; A &quot; licence for public  carriers  valid for two years, a &quot; B &quot; licence for  mixed carriers for one year, or a &quot; C &quot; licence for private  carriers valid for three years; these  periods were  in 1938 increased to five, two and five years, respectively.  Before granting an &quot;A&quot; or &quot; B &quot;  licence, the Licensing Authority isrequired, under Section 11 of the Act, &quot; to take into  consideration any objections to the application  which may be made by persons who are
    already  providing facilities,  whether  by means  of  road transport or    any other  kind of transport, for the  carriage  of  goods for hire or    reward in  the district,  or between  the places,  which  the applicant    intends  to  serve,  on the  ground that  suitable transport facilities in    that^ district, or between those places, are or,  if the application were    granted, would be, either generally or in respect of any particular type    of vehicles,  in excess of requirements, or on the ground that any of    the  conditions of the  licence held  by  the applicant has  not  been    complied with.&quot;     The &quot; A &quot;  licence  holder the operator using his vehicles for  hire    or reward has thus  received protection  from  new competitors,  but    at the price of much of his freedom.   He cannot alter his fleet without    permission,  increases being  rarely granted,  and must  keep  detailed    records  of  the work of each  vehicle.   When his licence  comes up for    renewal or variation, any of his competitors (including the railways),    can oppose it on the ground that adequate transport services already    exist in the  district or between the places  served,  and the onus  then    lies upon the  applicant to prove that his vehicles  are necessary.  An    application may  also be  opposed on the ground  that  the  nature of    the business has changed,   which includes a change  in the  nature    of the traffic carried or  the customers served, and the  operator may    find his fleet  cut down,  or  in  extreme cases  he may  be put  out of    business altogether.      The  &quot; B &quot;  licence holder the operator using his vehicles partly for     hire  or reward and  partly for his own  trade or business is even    more rigidly controlled,  as  his licence may specify a  limited radius     or  particular types  of load to which he  must confine himself  when    working for hire or reward,  and, as his licence is valid  for two years    only,  his  position is somewhat  precarious.      The  &quot; C &quot;  licence  holder the operator  using   his vehicles  solely    for his own trade or  business, i.e., not for  hire  or  reward is granted    his  licence as a matter  of  course, without  other  transport  operators    having the  right to object.  4. Road  Haulage Rates. The only outstanding complaint is thus  thatroad rates are still uncontrolled.  The  position  with regard to road  rates  is  that  the  British  RoadFederation^ Memorandum  of March, 1937, to  the Transport AdvisoryCouncil stressed  the desirability of  setting up  a  road  rates  structure,while the Railway Memorandum of September, 1936,  had  proposed thatroad hauliers should,  like the railways,  accept the obligations of publicity^-and non-discrimination  of rates as  an essential  step  to  the building up of any  stable and equitable system of co-ordination.   Discussion asto  the terms  on which machinery might be set up  to  effect co-ordinationwould,  according  to the Railway Memorandum,  probably be focussed on&quot; setting up, possibly through the medium of central and  local conferences,a system  for the agreement of  schedules of charges &quot;,  the  drawing up of conditions of carriage and  complementary  arrangements with other formsof  transport.  The Transport Advisory  Council&apos;s Report of July, 1937, accepted  these recommendations  and also  advocated  the setting up of  a  road  ratesstructure.   An  official intimation was given by the Minister of  transport on  February  9th, 1938,  that the  Government had accepted  this  policy.A Liaison Committee on road transport rates, consisting of representativesof all the  national road transport organisations,  was established in January,1938, to evolve  a road rates structure;  it has met frequently since thenand has made  headway  with the work it was designed  to undertake.   TheMinister of  Transport has  recently  expressed himself as satisfied that theCommittee is working in the  right direction.
  A separate memorandum on the subject of road rates is being submittedto the Transport Advisory Council by the Liaison Committee.  5. Objective of the Increasing  Control of  the Road Haulage Industry. The objective  of the  increasing control established over the road  haulage industry has  been to enable the road haulage  industry to  put  its ownhouse  in order with a view to its ultimate co-ordination with  other formsof transport.   In the  words of the Parliamentary Secretary,  Ministry ofTransport,  &quot; the Government agree  that  co-ordination of  transport isessential,  and that   is the  reason  for  past  and  present legislation &quot;.(Hansard, November  17th, 1937.)  It would  not be  unfair to say that  the  railways  have  provided  alarge  part  of  the drive  behind this  movement for  the  regulation  andcontrol of road haulage.  It has,  indeed, been recently stated by one of theprincipal  spokesmen  for  the  railways,  that  the legislative  changes inthe  position  of  the  road  haulage industry  have  largely  been  effectedat the instance of the railway companies themselves.  The road  haulage industry has,  to  a large  extent, been induced  to  agree  because it  hasunderstood  that the   Government has firmly resolved on the  ultimateco-ordination of all forms  of transport.  It has  seemed, therefore, that theproper policy  for the road haulage industry was to accept  this  decision as irrevocable, and to attempt to ensure that the process of co-ordinationtook place  as  smoothly as possible.  6. Volte-Face of the Railway Companies. It  would, therefore,  seem thatthe railway companies, after pressing for years for the control  of road haulage, after securing the  removal  of  nine-tenths  of their  complaints,and  with the road industry  on the verge of the establishment of  a roadrates  structure, now demand the general  removal of restrictions on theirown rates structure.   They appear to desire to possess that very freedom from  control which they  criticised as  so  intolerable  in the case of their competitors.               II.  Effect  of granting  the  Railways&apos;  Claim.  I.  Consequences of  Acceding to the  Railways&apos; Request.-\i the railwayssucceed in their claims and the statutory  &quot;  control &quot; of the road  haulage industry remains unaltered, there will be risks which cannot be ignored:        (i) Are Railway Rates to be Increased or Decreased? The railways    ask for  freedom  with  regard to their rates,  but  have  given  no    indication of how they  intend to  use their freedom.   It is not clear    whether they wish to increase their  rates, and  so obtain from the    trader more revenue than at  present,  or whether they wish to  reduce    their rates, freeze out road  hauliers, and then buy them  up cheaply    and establish an  uncontrolled railway monopoly of inland transport,    or thirdly, whether they would  use their  freedom to  increase some    rates and reduce  others simultaneously.      The  railways,   on  account of  their  size  and the   comprehensive    nature of their services, would be able to compel, at any rate  many,    traders  to  send the whole of their traffic  by rail,  on  pain  of their    refusing to take  any  of  it  except at  a prohibitive  charge,  if the   trader persisted in using  non-railway  transport.  They would,  indeed,   be completely free to put up their charges  to  an exorbitant level   against  traders who used either public  or  their own road transport.   They  could also  use  undue  influence to  deflect  traffic to  railway-   owned docks.  There can be  no equality of competition between four   railway  companies (directly  operating over  10,000  motor  vehicles of   their own, as well as docks and canals), on the one  hand, and, on the   other hand, 61,000 independent road hauliers with  &quot; A &quot;  and  &quot; B &quot;   licences,  operating 138,000 vehicles (including  9,400 &quot;A&quot;  contract   vehicles) in competition with  each  other.
     (ii)  The Railways as  Common Carriers. The granting of the railway   claims will materially  affect  their position as  common  carriers.   It   is understood that the  railways suggest that their obligation to accept   goods  should remain,  but  this obligation becomes  largely  illusory   if  the railway  companies  have  power  to make  what  charges they   choose in respect  of traffic  they may not wish to handle.     (iii) Need for both Road  and Rail in a  National Emergency.-The   railways point out that &quot; they are essential in peace, vital in war &quot;.   Although this is  true of  a large part  of their  systems,  the same   applies to road transport also.   In the event of heavy air bombardment   directed at vital  points in the transport system,  the  flexibility of   road  vehicles, operating as single  units .over 179,000 miles of roads,   would be  an invaluable asset for  the country, as  against the lesser   flexibility of railway trains  running on fixed tracks over 19,000 miles   of railway.   2. Analysis  of the  Railways&apos;   Position. The  British  Road Federation agrees that the  railways  have just grounds for  complaint in the difficulty they apparently experience  in  closing down small  stations and branch lines, which would never have been constructed had the internal combustion engine  been  invented  50 years  earlier.   There may possibly  in  some cases be  unneccessary difficulties  in  the way  of raising  railway  rates which have been reduced  experimentally without achieving the anticipated results.   The railways may also  reasonably feel  themselves to be unduly hampered  in their  freedom  to  adjust  their  rates to  circumstances,  by the  obligation  imposed  on  the  Railway  Rates  Tribunal  of considering new rates  in  relation  to their  effect on  the  railways&apos;  ability  to  earntheir standard revenue.   The British Road  Federation would point out, however, that the recent fall in railway traffics is not due to the competition  of road hauliers,  but in the  main to the decline in industrial activity which affects road hauliers equally with the  railways.  For the first nine  months of  193S,  compared with the corresponding  period  of 1937,  railway freight  receipts&quot;1 declined by 6-i per cent.; coal, coke and patent fuel  receipts  fell by 3-6 per  cent., and other minerals and  merchandise by 7-6 per  cent.  The dissection of other minerals  and  merchandise betv/een &quot; heavy &quot;  and &quot; light &quot; traffics is only available for the first eight months of 193S,  but,  for this period, minerals and merchandise  (Classes 1 to 6),  in which road competition is said to be less  effective, fell by 10-i  per cent., and merchandise (Classes 7 to 21),  which is said to be more exposed  to road  competition, by only 5-5 per cent.   The &quot; Economist &quot; Index  of  Business Activity shows a  fall of 5-6 per cent,  over the  first nine months of 193S, the  Board of Trade  Index of Industrial Production of 6-2 per cent., and Bank Clearings of 8-8 per cent. It is probable,  therefore, that the decline  in railway freight receipts  has been approximately in line  with the  general worsening of economic con- ditions.  Railway passenger  receipts,  on the other hand,  with  a fall of only 0-3  per cent., have done better than might be  expected in view of the decline in  the public&apos;s spending  power.   The  solution  of the railways&apos; problem  would,  therefore,  appear  to lie in the  direction of  reducing their expenditure rather than  of complaining about their receipts.  There  is no justice  in killing the independent road haulage industry  in order to  postpone the re-organisation  of the railway system.    Railway   re-organisation should  proceed  in the   direction of centralising freight  work on  the larger stations,  and making proper use of the  greater  effective  radius  of  motor  vehicles as against horses  for collection  and  delivery,  and  in this  regard a  welcome approach to  co- ordination might be made by the  railways in the direction of negotiating suitable arrangements with  existing independent hauliers.
              III. Relaxation  of  Road  Haulage  Restrictions.   1.  Necessity  of  Freeing the Road Haulage Industry  Concurrently with the Railways. The British Road Federation observes that the Minister of Transport has informed the Transport Advisory Council that, as at presentadvised, he is  inclined to the view that in existing circumstances thereis,  prima facie, a  case for some material relaxation of existing statutoryrailway  regulations, provided that  due  regard  is had to the  ultimate objective of the co-ordination of  all forms  of  transport.   It is felt that, if the Transport Advisory Council  should wish to abandon the policy,  recommended  in  its Report on Service and Rates,  of estab-lishing co-ordination by means of  a suitable- control  of  the  rates of all forms of transport, it snould recommend,  both in the interests of the pub-lic and  in justice to  the  road haulage industry,  that any relaxation  of restrictions  on  the  railways  must  be  accompanied simultaneously by a material relaxation of the special restrictions under which the road  haulage-industry labours and from which the  railways are free.  2. Amendments required in the Law affecting the Road Haulage Industry.! Certain amendments to the  existing law will become especially necessaryin the event of the railways obtaining a relaxation  of control,  in order tosecure the  continued existence of an independent  road haulage  industry,to establish  that equality of freedom from control which the railways nowadvocate, to give the trader freedom to choose the  means &quot;of transport he wishes to  employ,  and to prevent  the establishment of an uncontrolledmonopoly by the railways.  These are summarised  below:        (i) &quot; Objections &quot; to Licences. The right of the railways or of other    forms of transport than  the road haulage industry to  &quot;  object &quot;to    the  granting  of  &quot; A &quot;  and  &quot; B &quot; licences  should be confined  to    objections relating to  breaches of the law.   The licensing  authorities,    in granting or refusing licences, should take into  consideration only    the position of road services,  without  regard  to the  views  of other   forms of transport.     If road hauliers should be forced out of business in particular areas   or on particular routes in consequence of a rates war with the railways,   licences should be granted with reasonable ease to the same, other,  or   new hauliers up to the point at which traders may  be  considered  to   have  at their disposal reasonable road facilities outside railway control.     The whole body of case  law  relating to objections  to licences  under   the Road and Rail Traffic  Act, 1933, should be  abolished and a new   beginning made.  (Section 11  (2) of the Road  and  Rail Traffic Act,   1933-)      (ii) Freedom  of Transfer of Licences. There should  be complete   freedom  of  transfer of licences,  provided  always that  a  bona fide   business  is in existence.   (Section 21  of the Road  and Rail  Traffic   Act,  1933-)      (iii) Renewal  of Licences. The renewal of licences  when they  expire   should  be automatic  in respect  of  the  total tonnage  shown on  the   old licence, provided that  the  applicant  has observed the  law.      (iv) Reasonable  Flexibility. There should be reasonable flexibility   in additions  or deletions to the number of vehicles shown on a licence,   in the latter  case without prejudice to the position on  renewal.  (Section    10 (3) of Road  and Rail Traffic Act,  1933.)      (v)  Secrecy with regard  to Business held by Applicants for Licences.    A  change  should be  effected  in  the procedure  adopted  by  the   licensing authorities in the matter of &quot; objections &quot;  to  licences, with   a  view to making it unnecessary for applicants to  disclose details of   their business which could  be used by competitors against them.
9   his \J :J                               6JL   (vi) Road Rates Structure. The setting up of a statutory road ratesstructure should be adandoned, except in so far as the road haulage industry may  wish to proceed with it in its own interests.   (vii) Taxation. The present burden of special motor taxation shouldbe reduced to  a level equal to motor users&apos; fair share  of the cost ofthe roads.   This share was put by the Royal Commission on transport at two-thirds  of the  cost of  the roads,  while even  the Salter  Con-ference considered that a total  contribution  &quot; equal to the current expenditure  on roads  &quot;  was adequate.   The railway representatives on  the Salter  Conference stated thatthey  asked &quot; no more than that (commercial motor transport) should pay its  fair share of  the cost of the roads.   They do not ask  that,by taxation beyond  this point .... traffic  should be  forced  backto the railways.&quot;  The sum  derived  from special motor taxation wasto be regarded as &quot; the total contribution payable by all classes ofmechanically propelled vehicles,  whether in the form of licence  duty or petrol duty.&quot;   Should an additional  sum be required for general revenue  purposes,over  and  above commercial  motor transports fair share of the costof the roads, this  should be  levied in the form  of  a  special transporttax to which all forms of transport should contribute on an  equitablebasis.                        ;.  The cost of  the construction and maintenance of the road system should be  defrayed by all road users  and by  other parties benefitingfinancially from the construction  or improvement of the roads.  The present  method of financing  the road system, mainly  by a levyupon  ratepayers,  is grossly inequitable.   So  far as  motor users areconcerned, however, the ratepayers just grievance is due to  the short-comings  of Government book-keeping.   Only one-quarter of the revenuederived by the Government from  motor taxation is spent on the roads,the balance of their  cost being  left  to  be found by the unfortunateratepayer.   At  present  motor  vehicles  pay  in  special  taxation  half  as  muchagain as the total  cost of the  roads.  Special motor taxation amountsto ^88,000,000  a year, against a road cost of between ^55,000,000 and^60,000,000.   The taxation paid  by goods vehicles alone  amounts  to ^31,500,000a  year.  The Salter Conference,  on which the  railways were stronglyrepresented,  recommended  a contribution  by  goods  vehicles  of^23,500,000, on the assumption of  a total road cost of  ^60,000,000.  On  the  basis of the recommendations  of the  Salter Conference, towhich the  railways  subscribed,  there is thus  an  excess impost of^8,000,000 on  goods vehicles,  over and above their fair share of thecost of the roads.  This should either be abolished by  a reduction ofgoods vehicle taxation to an  equitable level in  relation  to the cost ofthe roads,  or,  if  the  Exchequer cannot afford this at  the present justice, the burden of special taxation should be shared by transportof all  kinds,  including  the railways,  and not confined to road transport.  In  this  connection,  it is of interest that,  in Germany  and Italy,where the  vital necessity  of adequate road transport facilities in theevent of a national emergency is  widely recognized,  taxation  of motor vehicles  has for many types  of vehicle been  entirely abolished:  even where it has not been  abolished,  it  has been substantially reduced.This,  moreover, has taken place concurrently with a progressive policyof road  construction,  a feature which has been markedly lacking inthis country.
   3. Danger of  Unilateral Action  to  Remove Railway Grievances.  i&apos;lieBritisli lvoad federation has no wish to stand in the way oi tne removalof any reasonable grievances the railways may have, but would point outthat,  li railway  restrictions  were  to be relaxed, while the present legalenactments by  whicn  the road haulage  industry  is  controlled  remained unchanged, tne result might well be tne disappearance oi  an independentroad naulage industry  ana the re-establishment ol  a railway monopoly  of inland transport,  which would deprive the trader  of  enective ireeaom  of choice of facilities, and diminish tne ability ot the transport system as awhole  adequately to cope with the problems which would arise in the eventof a national emergency.  If,  however, the removal of restrictions shouldbe undertaken, it is  essential that  it should proceed  pari passu for road and rail alike.   Any  unilateral removal of railway restrictions might well prove  disastrous.January,  1939.                             APPENDIX  XVII.  STATEMENT SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL BY THE BRITISH ROAD FEDERATION      IN RELATION  TO THEIR  MEMORANDUM OF  EVIDENCE (APPENDIX XVI)      AND THE AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN  THE RAILWAY  COMPANIES  AND      THE LIAISON  COMMITTEE ON ROAD TRANSPORT RATES.   (APPENDIX  VI.)    The British Road  Federation considers  that  the  agreement reached  between the Liaison  Committee and  the Four Main Line Railway Com-  panies with regard to the railways&apos; claim for a &quot; square deal,&quot;  and  em-  bodied in the Joint Memorandum and in the letters  exchanged between  the Chairman of the  Liaison Committee and Lord Stamp,  constitutes a  useful step forward towards the achievement of equitable rates agreements  between road and rail transport.    The  British Road  Federation wishes  to  draw  particular attention to  paragraph 22  of  the Joint  Memorandum, which states that &quot; nothing in  the proposals  involves any  interference with the right of a trader  to  use  his  own vehicles  under a &quot; C &quot; licence &quot;; to paragraph  19,  which deals  with &quot; Undue Preference &quot; and  states that railway rates should be reason-  able, and  that the Rates Tribunal, in considering  reasonableness,  should  have regard to the rates charged for traffic of the same description carried  under identical conditions  between the  same  points, and to the  rates  charged by competing  forms of  transport; and to paragraph  12, in which  it is made clear that  the agreement  is without prejudice to the  right of  either party to seek amendment to the licensing provisions  of the Road  and Rail  Traffic Act,   1933.   The British Road Federation  would, however, again emphasise its view, as set out in the Memorandum submitted  by  it to the Transport Advisory Council on  January 9th,  that  the  relaxation  of  the law  governing  the granting of  &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; licences is  a matter of urgent importance, both in the  interests  of the road  haulage  industry and  of  the public generally.   The railways have urged that  the  fact  that the right to &quot; object &quot;  to road licences extends to other forms  of transport than  themselves, would complicate  any attempt to  deal with amendments  to  the licensing law under the  present railway application.  They have, therefore, taken the view that this is not a matter which  could properly be  considered  in con- nection with their present claims, and  that for this reason it is  not appro- priate to include clauses in the Railway Bill  to amend  the  licensing law. Clauses have, nevertheless, been  drafted and  submitted to the transport advisory Council by the  British Road Federation.  These have been&apos; framed.
with  the  object of remedying the present anomalous position of the road haulage industry, by which all  otiier  forms of transport have  the  rightto &quot;  object &quot; to road licences, while hauliers have no right  to  &quot; object &quot;to the facilities provided by any other form of transport.  The &quot; gentleman&apos;s agreement,&quot; by which the railways agree, for a periodof two years,  to  refrain from exercising a  large part of their  powers to&quot; object &quot; to road licences, demonstrates, nevertheless, a welcome indica-tion of goodwill, although, as  the Joint Memorandum of the  Liaison  Com-mittee  of the Four Main  Line  Railway Companies states,  its  value  isdiminished  by the case law already established by the &quot; objections &quot; ofthe railways under the Road  and Rail Traffic Act, 1933.  It is, however,believed that- the undertaking  of the railway companies to discuss the roadproposals for the  amendment  of  the licensing law in a  sympathetic spirit,prior to the expiration of the &quot;  gentleman&apos;s agreement,&quot; should facilitate the friendly co-operation of both forms of transport.  The British Road Federation would urge,  nevertheless, that the Govern-ment should undertake  the amendments  to Part I of the Road and rail traffic Act,  1933, specified  by the British  Road  Federation, as  nearly aspossible simultaneously  with  the granting  of  any  measure of  increasedfreedom to  the  railways.CLAUSES PROPOSED BY THE BRITISH  ROAD FEDERATION  PROVIDING FOR THE    ALTERATION  OF  THE  ROAD  VEHICLE LICENSING  PROCEDURE  UNDER    PART I OF THE ROAD AND RAIL TRAFFIC ACT,  1933.  Clause  1. None but road competitors  to object  to licence applications. The licensing authority for the purposes  of  Part I of the Act  of 1933shall  not take into  consideration  an  objection  to  an  application  forthe&apos;grant or variation of a  goods vehicle  licence on the ground that trans-port facilities are  or if the application  were  granted would be in excess of requirements unless the  person making the objection satisfies the licensing authority that he is providing road transport  facilities  in the  district or between the places  which the applicant intends to  serve or that he  could provide such facilities  by extending the  existing road  transport facilities provided by him and after the passing of  this Act subsection  (2) of Section11 of the Act of 1933 shall  be read  and  have  effect accordingly.  Clause  2. Onus of proof concerning existing transport  facilities. Sub-section (2) of Section 11 of the Act of 1933 to be  amended by the additionof the following words:        &quot; Provided  further  that if on an  application for  an &quot; A &quot; licence    the applicant satisfies the licensing authority that there are persons    ready and willing to employ  him, the onus of proving that the exist-    ing facilities for the  carriage of goods  for hire  or reward in the district    or between the  places which the applicant intends to serve are,  or if    the application were granted would be, either  generally or in respect of    any particular type of vehicles in excess of requirements shall be  upon    any person or persons  who may have  objected to  the application on    any of such grounds.&quot;  Clause  3. Particulars  of  grounds of objection  to be specified. SectionIT of the Act of 1933  to be amended by  the addition  of  the followingsubsection:         &quot; (7) The  licensing authority  shall not  take  into  consideration any    objection to  an application for  a licence unless  particulars of the    grounds of objection are specified in  the objections and unless a copy    of the objections is  served by the objector upon the applicant at least    fourteen days before  the  hearing of  the application  by the licensing    autfiontv.&quot;
   Clause  4. As to evidence  of  withdrawal of road  transport facilities. 1The licensing authority in considering an application for the  grant orvariation  of  a licence shall not take into  consideration an  objection thatif ine  application were granted road transport, lacmues would  ue  in excessof requirements in any case where it appears to him  that previously exist-ing road  transport facilities serving the district were  withdrawn or  dim-inished in consequence of agreements for restricting road transport havingbeen  made  between  the persons  who  provided such  previously existing facilities and persons providing other forms of transport.   Clause  5. Transfer of licences  permitted. A licence granted  under theAct of 1933  may be transferred by the  holder thereof with  the consent ofthe licensing authority.   Provided  that  tne licensing  authority  shall  not  withhold  his consentunless it appears to him that the proposed transferee is  not a fit and properperson to  hold a licence as a carrier of goods or that the&apos;  road  transport facilities intended  to  be  provided under the licence will not be adequatelymaintained  by the  proposed transferee.   (2) Section 21 of the  Act of 1933 is  hereby  repealed.  Clause 6. Licence  holder&apos;s right to renewal The  holder  of an existing&quot; A &quot;  or  &quot; B &quot;  licence,  on making an  application,  shall be entitled to a renewal of the existing licence at the expiration thereof provided that the carrying  capacity  of the  motor  vehicles  or  trailers  authorised by thelicence is  not increased and that the applicant has not been guilty of wilfulor  continuous breaches of conditions of the existing licence.   Clause 7. Provision in licence for expansion  of business. In consideringan application for  the grant of a licence, the licensing authority shall haveregard  to and make allowance in the licence -       (1) for the seasonal  fluctuations  in  trade;       (2) for the normal expansion of  the business  of  the applicant. ^   Clause  S.-Penalty for disclosing information of applicant&apos;s business. Where on an application for a licence it appears to the licensing  authority that a person  who has. made  an objection  is  endeavouring to use  hisposition as  an objector  to obtain information  about the business of theapplicant in  order to increase his own business or  the business of  someother person as a  carrier of goods, the licensing authority may direct thatsuch information shall not be furnished and if after such  direction shallhave been given any person procures or attempts to  procure such informa-tion without permission signed  by the licensing  authority,  he shall be guilty of  an offence under  this Act.   Clause g. Representations concerning the grant of road service licences. Subsection  (3) of  Section 72  of the  Act of  1930,   which directs the traffic Commissioners to take into consideration any representations whichmay  be made by persons who  are already  providing transport  facilities,shall be amended  by substituting for the words &quot; transport facilities  &quot; thewords  &quot; road passenger transport facilities &quot;.Notes  in  explanation of Clauses.  Clause 1. This  clause amends Section n (Objections to certain applica-tions  for   licences  or  variations  of  licences)  under   which   it  is   now the duty  of  the licensing  authority to  take into consideration  objectionsby Railway  Companies  to  the grant of a  licence on the ground of  corn-petition against the  Railways.  These objections are expressed in Section11  (2)  as  the objections &quot; made  by  persons who  are already providingfacilities,  whether by means of  road  transport or any  other  kind oftransport  ...  on the ground that suitable transport facilities would bein excess of requirements &quot;.
                          APPENDIX XVIII.MEMORANDUM  SUBMITTED  TO THE  COUNCIL BY  THE SCOTTISH COMMERCIAL                      MOTOR USERS&apos;  ASSOCIATION.  The Scottish Commercial Motor Users&apos; Association  respectfully submit the undernoted comments  in connection with the question of Railway rates which the Minister has remitted to the  Transport Advisory Council.9 n f*  The clause is intended to  provide that  objections on the  ground  of competition shall be restricted to  road transport operators.  The  RailwayCompanies have made full use of this statutory right of objection, and the complaint  is made  by Road  Transport  that they have no  correspondingopportunity to  object to any  action  taken by  the Railway  Companies  tomake their railway competition more  effective against Road Transport.  Clause 2. There has been much complaint of the injustice of applicants &apos;being unable  to ascertain before  the hearing the precise  objections theyhave  to  meet.  Clause  3. This clause shifts  the  onus of  proof  of the existence  ofsuitable  transport facilities from the  applicant to the objectors.  Clause  4. This  clause  is  intended  to  meet  the  case  where  road transport  facilities  have been reduced by an arrangement made  for thatpurpose  between the  Railway  Company and the. goods vehicle  licenceholders  serving  the district,  and  it is  contended  by  objectors  that  the reduced  facilities are  evidence  of diminished  demand.   In such  a casethe clause directs the licensing authority to disregard the  objection.  Clause  5. The  transfer of  licences  is  prohibited  by Section  21  ofthe Act of 1933, except in the case of death or bankruptcy.  It is againstcommon sense  and justice  to attempt to  stop the  sale  and  purchaseof  a legitimate business,  and  consequently methods  have been  devised to  evade  the prohibition  of  Section 21.  The clause proposes  to repeal the  prohibition,  but to require  the approval of the  licensing  authorityso as to ensure  that the licence does not pass into the  hands of a person,who  would not be granted a licence.   It contains also a provision designedto prevent the  licence  from  being transferred for  the purpose of stiflingthe road transport facilities which it  was intended to provide.  Clause 6. A bad  feature  of  the  licensing system  under  the  Act of1933  is  the  licensee&apos;s  insecurity of tenure  through  liability to attack by objecting competitors  when the  licence comes  up  for  renewal.   he ought to  be assured  of  the  renewal  of his  licence if he conducts  his business properly.   Clause  7. The  object  of  this clause is to  secure  flexibility  in   thelicence to  meet fluctuations in business.   The experience of Road Transport Contractors  under the present law has been that the narrow margin whichis permitted  in the licence and the  cumbrous procedure for the variation of  a licence  do not give them a reasonable opportunity to cater for an occasional increase in  demand for transport facilities.   Clause 8. In spite  of official denials and protestations to the contrary, there is ample evidence of the practice of  an applicants customers being canvassed by  competitors  as a  result  of  information  obtained  about his business in proceedings before the licensing authority.  The  clause proposesas  a remedy that  disclosure shall be an offence and  render the  persons responsible liable to a penalty.   Clause  9. This  clause  relates to  passenger  transport,  and  is self-explanatory.   21st February, 1939.
  I. In  view  of  the Ministers comment  in  making  the  remit,  this association are primarily concerned with       (i) the  effect which  the  grant of  all  or any  of the  relaxations    requested  may have on the  interests of  its members.       (2) the possible effect of retarding or preventing desirable regulation    in road  transport  which has ultimate  co-ordination  as  its purpose.  2. The Association is  a member of the British Road  Federation.  3. The Association is  also  represented  on the Liaison Committee  andhas been taking part  in  the formation of a&apos; Road Rates  Structure withnecessary relative  provisions.  4. It is  desired,  on this occasion  to invite the attention of the Councilto aspects of the  present consideration which  appear to relate peculiarlyto the Carriers of  Goods by  Road and more particularly to the operationof that business in Scotland.  5. On the  general  question  of regulation  of transport, the  association would refer  to the differing procedure for regulating  transport  wages  inScotland, both in previous and present legislation.   There are  also  out-standing  instances  of  fluctuation in Railway  Rates  in Scotland, as  wellas differences in Railway procedure which  may to some  extent be due  to basic differences obtaining at the time  of railway grouping.  It is, therefore,felt that seme expression of  Scottish opinion may be  accepted  by theT.A.C. in the present deliberations.  6. The Association had taken the view,  confirmed by  public utterancesof  the  Minister  and  other  responsible  authorities,  that  the  systemof licensing and transport provisions were part of a comprehensive schemeintended  to  promote  better regulation within the industry and ultimately to facilitate complete co-ordination between  road and rail.  This was assumed to  be the accepted public policy subscribed  to by road  and rail interestsalike.  7. In making this comment  the Association  have considered  it desirableto  support their views on this aspect by appending hereto a note of someauthoritative instances (see  Appendix A) which  appear to  indicate a  very strong railway opinion on the matter.  S. In  view of the  financial  results encountered  by the  Railways sincethe publication of the statements above  referred to and  having regard  to railway opinion that road traffic is in some  degree responsible for fallingrailway revenues,  the Association would have considered that a railwaydemand  for  some  expediting  of the  rates  and co-ordination plans  was reasonable and justified  but they are  compelled to take a  different viewof a  demand which is a complete  volte-face in  both railway  and public policy.  9. In appealing  to the Council to  be  heard in this respect,  the Asso-ciation have  due regard to the Railway point of  view that there is urgent necessity for some relief  from disabilities which are having adverse results in railway operation but they would  strongly  urge that the Council  willhesitate  to acquiesce in  any scheme  which  may only have the effect  of moving  disabilities  from one  transport  service to another.  10. If the  Council find any element  of justification for the  railway claim,it would not be elementary justice to road  transport to adopt as a methodof rectification of railway disabilities, the granting  of  complete  freedom to  rail without simultaneously  reviewing, not  only  the maintenance  of road  transport legislation adopted and accepted  as part of complete plantbut also the  constantly  mounting legal precedents  which  have  emerged therefrom.
   II. Any  suggestion  that road be  relieved of  existing  legislative pro-visions, for the purpose of putting the road service on a basis of complete freedom equivalent to that now demanded by rail, is not looked upon withfavour  by  this Association.   It would  prefer the gradual acceptance  of reasonable  regulation of  both  services  and would  urge  that  any new provisions should apply  simultaneously to both  road and rail.   12. The Association is not unmindful of the importance of the time factoras explained by the Railways in their claim, and while it is appreciated that the  adoption of the scheme of rates  control outlined in the T.A.C.Report  on Service and Rates would  ultimately meet the case,  it is readilyadmitted that  this  could not  give useful results within a  time  whichcould be  regarded as reasonable.   13. The T.A.C. scheme has afforded a useful  basis  of enquiry, but from the experience of  this  Association  in  the  process  of exploring itsplan, the following  main  points of  opinion have been  reached:        (1) that it  should  still be the duty of the road industry to produce     and  regulate  its own rates to the same extent as  railways.       (2) that  it  is not possible to  contemplate a useful road rates  structure-     ture  which is not to a large  degree  subject to rail agreement.       (3) that  no rates  structure would be  serviceable without statutory     enforcement.       (4) that  a  rates structure  statutorily  enforceable  would require to     be protected against competing transport.       (5) that  in order to give full  effect to (3) and (4) above there  would     require to be machinery of negotiation and compulsory decision applic-     able to both road and rail.       (6) that  classification and conditions of  carriage  would ^generally     require  to  be common to  both services.       (7) that  enforcement on railways would be adequately covered  by     existing law  and on  roads would be vested  in the Licensing  Author-     ities.       (8) that negotiations would require to be commenced with the  object     of  facilitating Area  Rates negotiations  with Railways.       (9) that  existing enactments  governing fixation or variation of rail-     way rates  might  require  to be  modified  or  amended  to  permit of     agreements.   14. With regard to those main points enumerated  in No. 13 above, theAssociation have  reached the  conclusion that,  however desirable it  mightbe to work towards the  principles  set out in the  T.A.C. report, progressin such direction was much impeded by such considerations  as:         (r) that  the nature  and pace  of changes  modernising  legislation     governing transport  had  in recent  years, not been in harmony with     the pace at which the instruments  of  transport had been modernised.       (2) that  road  transport  had been governed  largely by a code  which     did little more  than satisfy the expedient of  the  moment.       (3) That rail  transport&apos; was regulated by a code of law which had no     adequate  regard for modern changes  in  commercial or competitive     conditions.       (4) That unsatisfactory  legal  restrictions had been consistently used     by Railways  as a means of restricting the activities and usefulness of     competitors.       (5) That in the atmosphere  thus introduced the  probable  benefits     of complementary service had been obscured.
        (6)  That under existing conditions, the trader so disposed has every      opportunity ot exploiting the services.  The Association had iurcher concluded that as and when it could be decided  to introduce legislation giving eltect to the T.A.C. rates proposals, it would  be desirable to  suggest some more comprehensive provisions.    15. It is the considered opinion of the Association that it will be extremely  difficult if not  impossible  to work  towards  achievement  of  the  T.A.C.  plan  without  some  statutory assistance and this  dithcuity will  certainly  not be  diminished if the railways procure  the freedom they  seek.  On  the other hand the  railways may Have  perfectly legitimate  reasons for  protesting against undue or uncertain delay and may feel  that the Short  Act which tney suggest is the most ready -means of meeting the case thus  demonstrating that  some  temporary  legislative  assistance  is -required 011  both  sides.    16. While this Association would not object in principle to  a measure  giving some  temporary relief to railways in demonstrated disabilities  it has  special  regard to past  experience in Scotland  with particular reference to  instances  as undernoted:        (1)  The  granting of special  and definitely uneconomic rates to divert     road traffic, e.g.  Aberdeen fish reduced from 60s.  to 15s.       (2)  The advent of railways into household  removal  trade and  the     granting of illegal privileges.       (3)  The  unregulated cutting of  local cartage  rates.       (4)  The systematic objection to  established  hauliers even  on local     work. These and other instances cause the Association to have some apprehension as to the use to which the new freedom will be put and while the intentions put forward by  the Railway Headquarters are not doubted in  principle, the Association suggest  that when left to local interpretation the difficulties arising  will  not be  less  complicated  than those  of the  road  transport industry in  attempting to  control its scattered units.   17.  At  the  present stage the  Association  is  not  disposed  to ask  for any immediate relief but they would respectfully suggest that if the Council are satisfied that there is a case for recommending legislation to afford relief to railways,  they could best expedite  a great  measure of co-ordination by recommending  that  such legislation includes provision  by which any varia- tion in existing railway charges shall be agreed by  and obligatory on road carriers.   18. It may be that a comprehensive  measure embracing all desirable pro- visions for re-organisation would not  be practical politics at the  moment and  might result  in  undue  delay  but  it is suggested that  an agreed &quot; Enabling Bill &quot;  covering  a definitely  fixed transitionary period  could provide  as under:         (1) Immediate relief desired by  railways.       (2) Protection of  trading interests and road transport.       (3) The  opportunity  to introduce  some  measure  of  road  rates     enforcement.      (4) The statutory enforcement of road and rail agreements on rates.The Association has taken the liberty of tabulating (as  per Appendix B) an outline of the proposals in this respect.  19. In submitting the foregoing, the Association has deliberately avoidedreference  to any question other than the  merits of the railway  claim andthe probable  effect  on its members should such claim  be admitted but it
must not be taken as acquiescing in the view that road transport is whollyor  materially responsible for the  adverse  railway results  and while  theexisting railway  method is  a question  for  their  own consideration  thepossibility of criticism is not absent.  The  policy adopted by the railways in Scotland is probably the cause of at least some of their loss.  20. The Association would be prepared if desired, to be represented at theCouncil&apos;s inquiry and  to furnish any  necessary amplification  of the views expressed herein.January,  1939.                APPENDIX &quot; A &quot; to APPENDIX XVIII.  Excerpt from  the  Final Report of the Royal Commission on Transport,December,  1930; page 29, paragraphs 95 to 99.  After  dealing  with  the  evidence  concerning  disabilities   of  RailwayCompanies and inquiring as to whether these could be removed or modified,the Report states in paragraph 99 :         &quot; But when it came to the possibility of removing these disabilities,    the companies had few  suggestions to make to us.  They informed us    that  it would be possible for Parliament to remove a large number of    the statutory disabilities to which they referred,  but that such action    would probably create confusion and be strongly opposed by the trading    interests.  We  were told that from the railway  companies&apos;  point of    view  many  of their disabilities could best be dealt with by the regula-    tion of road transport, but in two specific cases they expressed a wish    that  modifications should be made.&quot;  The two specific cases referred to are payment of passenger duty amount-ing to  400,000 per annum and the question of maintenance of roads overrailway bridges.  Excerpt from the Report of the Conference on Rail and Road Transport,dated 29th July, 1932.  (The Salter Report.)  The Salter  Conference, after making  the  same  inquiry regarding theremoval  of Railway  disabilities,  quoted in  paragraph 96,  page 31,  asunder:        &quot; Even in the matter of rates,  where it might seem prima facie that    the existence of  effective competition over  the  whole area of  the rail-    ways&apos; work makes the system in force as regards railway rates  unneces-    sary,  we  do  not recommend  any fundamental  change.   Capricious    discrimination  in rates, while  it  may in some  cases   secure  extra    receipts and in  others  extra  traffic  not otherwise  obtainable,  is no    satisfactory principle for common carriers to work upon,  either from    the point of view of the transport industry itself or of the trade and    commerce served.  Indeed when  a common carrier service is organised    in large units,  the  commercial  obligation  of fair  treatment  towards    customers must in practice prevent such discrimination.  It is the fact    that the railways are so organised, and not the existence of statutory    regulation, which mainly accounts for the handicap of the railways  in    this respect; and this handicap would not be  substantially reduced by    any  change in law  or administration; nor would  traders  generally be    likely to accept willingly such  a  change.&quot;  Excerpt from  the Transport  Advisory Council  Report  on Service and rates; page 3, section 7.  The internal organisation of the road transport industry must be regardedas an essential preliminary to further progress.
go   In the Memorandum from the four main line Railway Companies,  dated 7th September,  1936,  which forms Appendix 1 to the T.A.C.  Report, the Companies express the following opinion.  (See page 14):         &quot; In  the  circumstances the railway  companies  do not ask  to  be     exempted from these obligations,  whicn they consider not inappropriate     to  a public service, but they think  it reasonable  to ask tnat their     competitors on  the  roads should now  also accept  the  position of  a     public  service, with  the regulations  appropriate to the type  of service     which they  offer.  At  present traffic is diverted from the  railways by     competitors  who have  lull knowledge  of the rates quoted  by the rail-     ways, whilst their own rates are, or can be, veiled in complete secrecy.     In the same way,  road, hauliers are  in a position to  carry at any rates     that suit their interest at the moment without any obligations, such as     are incumbent on the  railways, to extend the favour to other traders     forwarding in similar  circumstances.  It would appear  reasonable to     argue that if such legislative restrictions on the freedom of one  trans-     port agency are  beneficial to the  public,  they are likely to be beneficial     also  in the case of their competitor.       &quot; The acceptance  of the obligations of publicity and non-discrimina-     tion is, in the opinion of the railway companies, a step essential to the     building up  of any stable ana equitable system of co-ordination.&quot;In the Report of the Committee on Regulation of Wages  and  Conditions ofService,  page 27, paragraph 74,  the  Committee express the opinion thatin the interests of  transport generally, uneconomic competition should be checked  and  that it is undesirable to bring one Section of the  industry under  restraint of regulation leaving another section uncontrolled.   TheCommittee further commend that &quot; an obvious  and effective  way of  doing so would be to fix rates of charges which they probably  regard as outwiththeir terms of reference.&quot;                APPENDIX  &quot; B &quot; to APPENDIX XVIII.

APPENDIX XIX.MEMORANDUM SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL BY THE TRADERS&apos;  CO-ORDINATING                       COMMITTEE ON  TRANSPORT.   (Note. A memorandum almost identical in terms was also submitted bythe Mansion House Association on Transport).   (1) Traders recognise  that the Railways,  like  other forms of Transport,are essential to the wellbeing  of the community, and agree that the Rail-ways are at present operating under certain limitations and restrictions  inconnection with their charging powers and conditions of carriage which place them at a disadvantage in competing with other methods of transport whichare not so restricted.   (2) They are of the  opinion, however, that  whilst in  theory it wouldappear  equitable for all forms of  transport  to operate on  a: common basis as regards their methods of charging, this could, in  practice, only be done if  the method of assessing such charges were  the same for each form  oftransport, e.g. if the charges were based on the cost of carriage of theparticular types of traffic, or on some other agreed  basis  acceptable to all forms of  transport.  Traders realise that under present conditions it is not possible to apply the above methods of charging to railway traffic, owing mainly to the factthat      (a) Standing charges which form the larger proportion of the costs  of    carriage by rail cannot be  disintegrated and  applied to individual types    of traffic.      (b) Many  industries  of  the  country particularly the  &quot; heavy &quot;    industries have been located and built  up under the present system  of    charging &quot; what the traffic will bear &quot;,  and  to attempt  to apply to all    rail-borne traffic any  such  common basis of charging  as referred to    above would  lead to repercussions  which would not  be in the public    interest.  Moreover, even if these methods could be applied  to railway  traffic,  itwould not be possible to do so in the case of Road  traffic unless  and until a rates structure has been applied to the Road Transport  Industry.  (3)  In the meantime Traders are prepared  to agree to certain relaxationsof  the restrictions imposed upon  the Railways provided that      (a)  Adequate safeguards are introduced to ensure that the interests    of both Industries  and  individual  Traders   whether  as  consignors or    consignees are not  prejudiced.
9 -5 *)&amp;j    (fc) There is no restriction of the  existing right of Traders to make  use of their own road transport lor  carriage ot their goods,  in accord-  ance with Part I of the Road  and Rail Traffic Act, 1933.    (c)  There is  no restriction  on the  unfettered right of the  Trader to  select the form of transport which  he approves, and which is most  economic and  convenient for his purpose.    (d) Consideration of some re-arrangement of  the Railway.. Capital  Structure.(4) The relaxations referred  to are  as  follows:      A.  A simplification and  modification of the present railway classifies  tion and rates structure, and of  the conditions of carriage by rail.    B.  The abolition of Railway  Rates Tribunal&apos;s  jurisdiction in respect  of certain matters now under review.    C. The. granting to the Railway  Companies of  the right  to  quote  any exceptional rate, including  period rates, in their discretion without  reference to the  Railway Rates Tribunal or report  to  the Minister of  Transport.    D. The amendment of the present  requirements with  regard to  undue  preference but only so as  to enable  the Railways to reduce any rate,  subject to  proof that such reduction was necessary in order  to meet  competition for the same traffic by other means of transport.    E. The repeal of the Standard Revenue provisions of  the Railways  Act, 1921.(5) The Traders would  make the  following stipulations :     &apos;    (a)  Classification and Rates Structure. The Classification  should be  simplified by reducing the number of  packing entries  in different classes.  Maximum rates, based  on the level of  the existing  standard  rates,  should be retained, including the continuance of through rates  based  on the  principle  of  continuous  mileage  and  the  existing  minimum  distances.   The  chargeable   distance  should  be  the only  distance  recognised for  maximum rate purposes,  and  should  be clearly defined  on  the following basis: the  shortest physical distance, together with  abolition of bonus mileage.  The principles laid down in Section 34 (2)  and Schedules 4 and 5 of the  Railways Act, 1921,  should be retained.   Conditions of Carriage. The existing  Statutory  Conditions might  well bo retained with freedom to the  Railway Companies to agree with  Traders  less onerous conditions  on either side  where necessary.   The  Railway  Companies  should  retain   their   obligations  as  Common  Carriers under the existing  Statutes.  Provisions covering private  siding  facilities, private siding rates and rebates should be retained.  Condi-  tions governing reasonable  facilities for  the receiving, forwarding and  delivering of traffic should  be retained.   (5) Railway  Rates  Tribunal. While it is  agreed  that  the jurisdic- tion of the Railway Rates  Tribunal should be abolished in respect of  certain matters  now  under  review,  Traders feel strongly that  some form  of  appeal to an independent authority should be  provided to deal with cases in which they may have legitimate cause for complaint, such as increase of railway rates,  excessive railway  rates, insufficient or unreasonable facilities, private siding rates and rebates, etc.   The independent authority  should  also be  empowered to deal with any  proposed  increase  of  rates  by the  Railway  Companies  upon whom  the onus of proof of necessity  for  such increase should lie,  with special provisions on the lines of  Section 38, sub-sections 3  and 4 of the Railways Act, ig2i.
10th January, 1939.  (6) The Railway Companies have  announced their intention of issuing  price-lists &quot; for rail transport.  Pending further information as to precisely what they intend to do in this direction Traders are not able to comment on  the proposal.   They feel, however, that if the Railways are granted the relaxations referred to above, they will not suffer any serious disabilitythrough continuing to publish all their rates and chargeable distances for public inspection as at  present.   Traders, therefore,  are  not prepared toagree to any  relaxation in this respect.  (7)  Traders realise the  possibility of price-cutting competition  betweenRail  and other transport interests leading to the wholesale  reduction  ofrates whether temporary or permanent to a point below the cost of service.  They have no desire to see this occur, and welcome the assurances givenby the Railways  that this is not their intention.  They would appreciatesimilar assurances  from other forms of transport, and would not be averseto  legislation which would ensure that these assurances would be imple-mented by all parties.  At the  same time Traders would be strongly averse to any combination of the various forms of Transport designed to bolster up or endeavour tomaintain high transport charges, which would handicap  trade and industryin their activities,  or the ultimate creation of any  machinery  or procedurebetween any forms of public transport which would prevent the rapid  quo-tation of  rates by any party; and it is essential that the  rates should be arrived at in relation solely to factors affecting the particular form  of trans-port employed and not artificially linked  with the  rates by other  forms oftransport.  (8) Traders wish to record their opinion that the above  submissions andrelaxations  should enable the Railways to attain the competitive position which they wish to occupy.  They regard these proposals,  however, as a purely temporary measure,designed to afford to all concerned the necessary time  to evolve a scheme-which will  ultimately  ensure systems of  rates  and conditions of carriage,which will apply  equitably to  all forms of  public transport.   In the Trader&apos;s view it is only by this means that the various forms ofPublic Transport  will  achieve  co-ordination  and be  able to  render theservices which  will best meet the requirements of industry.   (9) To  the  Railway Companies in particular the Traders suggest that anypresent plea that they put forward can only be viewed as a part of a largerinquiry which should be made into  the  following questions:         (a) Efficient and economical management of the Railways.       (b) Consideration  for  any  variable local  conditions of trade  and     industry in the country.       (c) Overhauling of all redundant Railway facilities or services and,     where  practicable,  the providing of  modern methods and  facilities in     lieu thereof.       (d) The consideration of unremunerative ancillary businesses.   Traders assume that the  terms of reference now  before  the transport advisory Council  empower them to  consider these suggestions, but if notthe Traders are of opinion that this important aspect should be investigatedas  speedily  as  possible.
                              APPENDIX XX.   MEMORANDUM SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL BY THE TRADERS&apos; CO-ORDINATING       COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT SUPPORTED  BY THE FEDERATION OF BRITISH       INDUSTRIES  AND THE MANSION HOUSE ASSOCIATION ON  TRANSPORT IN       RELATION TO THE AGREEMENT REACHED between  THE RAILWAY COMPANIES       AND  THE LIAISON  COMMITTEE  ON ROAD TRANSPORT  RATES.   (APPEN-       DIX VI.)     The Traders have  considered with great interest the Joint Memorandum   to the Transport  Advisory  Council  Dy the Railway companies  and the   Liaison Committee on Road Transport Rates, and, while agreeing  tnat it is   in accordance with the  report of the Transport Advisory  council  tnat co-   ordination of dhrerent means of transport  snould be sought, it was not in   the contemplation of the Traders that such co-ordination meant something   which might well lead to a transport  trust,  nor was it contemplated that   the structure of rates in different  lorms of transport should follow the same   lines  or conditions.   In  other words, that the rates structure lor the  roads   should  be of quite  a  different nature  from the rates structure on  the   railways,  owing to the essential difference of the two types of carriage.  No   one,  other than the Railway Companies themselves, has access  to their   own lines, whereas the roads are  available  to all.     With regard to the discretion  of granting or refusing  applications  for   &quot;  A &quot; or &quot; B &quot;  licences,  stress is laid upon the terms of the Road and   Rail Traffic  Act, which requires, inter alia,  that the interests of  persons  requiring  facilities for transport are to be  taken into account.  It is felt  that the arrangements made  in the agreement, subject as they are unless  special provision is made in legislation,  to be governed by the cases already  decided, do not give sufficient scope to this interest.   As regards  the proposed machinery for co-ordination referred to in the  agreement, the proposal appears to envisage that the Consultative Com-  mittee of road and rail representatives should consider the  principles  upon  which agreements can be  entered into in regard  to  rates to  be  charged  by road and  rail for  merchandise, with  due  regard  to the effect of  such  agreements on other interests.   Until the meeting with the Railway Companies on the 16th February, it  appeared to the Traders  from the form of the document, coupled  with  the clauses, that that  meant that a rate should  be agreed which would be  applicable  both by road  and  rail, and  it might not  be departed from  in  relation to such matters as were the subject of agreement both as regards  conditions  of carriage, the rate to  be paid for  carriage and services  offered  and the places between which the merchandise was to be carried.   It is, however,  the  view of the Railway  Companies that this does not mean what it appears to the Traders to say but  that there might be a differential rate between road and rail; for example that for  short distances the  road might be  preferred to  the rail in the differential, the reverse  taking place as regards long distances, but even if this were so it would  mean that the  flexibility  of charge which has been one of the  objects of the Railway Companies  would  in  every  case  where  such  an  agreement  is made be sacrificed and  that they  would not be able  to charge  an exceptional  rate in special circumstances  to any Trader, nor  could special circumstances arising  during  the term of the  agreement result in reduction or increase of rate as the  case might  be.   The fears which the  Traders feel with regard to what is reasonableness of rates  are aggravated by the provisions contained in the agreement,  forwhen any agreement is put forward  by the Railway  Companies and  theroad interests  to the Rates Tribunal for  approval, if  approved it must inevitably result in the rate set out in the agreement  being  regarded as a
                                                                         A&apos;  f f*  reasonable one in relation  to any  subsequent appeal to  the Tribunal as  regards a similar rate not included in sucn agreement in relation to a pro-  duct of a similar nature or in respect of places not referred to in the agree-  ment.   In other words  it  would, be  a precedent for what  is reasonable  elsewhere.    One  great  difficulty as regards  the question of what  is reasonable in  relation to a railway rate is that whereas what is a  reasonable charge for  goods supplied can well be tested by cost plus profit, which  may be regarded  by the person considering the matter to be  reasonable,  it  has always been  understood that it is impossible for the Railway Companies to give such  particulars in the case  of  a particular service as  would enable such  a  criterion to be arrived at.    It will be noted in this connection that  it was suggested by the Railway  Companies at the meeting  on the  16th February that the  Traders  could  intervene  in  relation to the  confirmation  of an agreement  before  the  Tribunal, but it is obvious that  whereas the  particular rate contained in an  agreement  might  be only  of  interest  to  some few Traders, the  great  majority of Traders, although  not affected directly by  that  agreement,  would be affected by the question of reasonableness, as intimated  above.    Incidentally,  it might be  mentioned in this connection that if this is to  be the  test, or  a  test which is material from the point of view of reason-  ableness, it would be necessary for  the Traders, in order  to  protect their  interests, to oppose  the  confirmation  of every agreement which  was  put  forward, resulting in enormous  expense, delay  and inconvenience.   A further difficulty also arises with  regard to applications by  rail  and  road for confirmation of an agreement made between them,  and that is that  the matters to  be taken into account  by  the Tribunal, as referred to in  Clause  6 of the first part of this Memorandum, would not appear to be  relevant.  They should, however, apply equally to an application of this  kind.   While the charges  would be rigid  under one proposal,  it is at the same time suggested,  under another proposal, that there should be power in  the Railway Companies still to grant agreed charges  and in the  road hauliers to agree to contracts.  It would  appear on the face of it  that the two pro- posals are mutually destructive.   It will be noted that the final clause of the agreement suggests that there would be ample safeguards for the protection of trade and  industry in the form of a  right of appeal to  a judicial tribunal.   As to  this point,  the remarks above indicate the Traders&apos;  dissent from this proposition.   It  is  also suggested  in  this  paragraph  that  although the competition would be of a  different kind  under correlated  systems of rates,  the question of winning traffic either by road  or rail,  would be the quality of the service which it renders.  If, however,  there were a differential rate, this is  not strictly  accurate.  A small  point arises with regard  to  the question of expenses.   These should only be available out of the fees paid by applicants for &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; licences.   It  will be noted from what has been said that the fears  expressed  by the Traders in relation to safeguards  in  the original Memorandum  and the evidence are aggravated by the agreement which has been come to between rail and  road.  If this agreement is proceeded with, the Traders would ask  that  itshould be so altered that it  is not at variance with  the  proposals in theMemorandum which they have submitted in  conjunction with the  railwaycompanies (Appendix XI).  16th March,  1939.
