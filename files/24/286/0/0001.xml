Memorandum by the  Minister of Health.      lo    X  desire to obtain Cabinet approval to the introduction into the House of Lords of  a Bill to consolidate,with amendments,  the general law regulating  the supply ofwater by  the local authorities and water companies  inEngland and  Wales,   The Bill,, which is  already drafted, is included  in  the  list of Bills reported by the Home  AffairsCommittee to the  Cabinet on the  2nd November, 1938, (Cabinet  52  (38)  Conclusion 5 and Appendix II) 0      2o    The object of the Bill is to gather up into one Act all  the general  law provisions on the subject, and  the most suitable  of  the  common form provisions usually included  in modern Special Acts relating to  public water supply.   Therehas  been  no  general revision of  the law  since 1863, and  no comprehensive revision since the Waterworks  Clauses Act  of 1847, The  Bill  has no  application to Scotland  or Northern Ireland.      3o    The Bill is based on the Second Report of the  central advisory  Water Committee,  which  was appointed by Sir  Kingsiey Wood, after consultation with other Ministers,with Field Marshal Lord Milne as Chairman, to advise  the Government Departments on  questions of water policy.   TheCommittee includes one Member of Parliament  and representatives of the four  Associations of local authorities and of  all other Associations concerned with questions of water supply.
4    Copies of the Report (Cmd. 5986 of 1939) and of a draft Water    Undertakings Bill (Cmd. 5987) appended to it are annexed,        4a    Since the publication of the Report I have referred    the draft Bill to the various Associations of Local Authorities    and to the Government Departments and other &quot;bodies concerned,    and a number of minor alterations have &quot;been made in the Bill    to meet the views expressed by these bodies0         5.   The Bill is not pure consolidation and cannot,    therefore, be referred to the Joint Select Committee on    Consolidating Bills.   The Bill, if passed, would effect a    considerable simplification of the law and would be of great    value to statutory water undertakers, to local authorities, and    to the general public.         6.   I propose that following the procedure adopted in the    case of the Local Government Act, 1933, the Public Health Act,    1936, and the Pood and Drugs Act, 1938, the Bill should be    introduced into the Lords and that after second reading the two    Houses should be invited to appoint a Joint Select Committee to    consider the Bill.   I am assured that the passage of the Bill    will he welcomed &quot;by the Associations of local authorities,    water undertakers and other bodies concerned with public water    supply, and I see no reason to suppose that the Bill will make    any real demands on the time of Parliament.   If this forecast    proved inaccurate the Bill could be dropped at any stage but    even its printing and circulation would he an advantage to all    concerned.

CENTRAL ADVISORY WATER COMMITTEE.                  SECOND REPORT.                          PART I.To the Rt. Hon. WALTER ELLIOT, P.C., M.C., M.P.,        Minister of Health.SIR,  We have the honour  to submit to you herewith the second report of our proceedings.  i. Lieut-Col.  A. P.  Heneage,  D.S.O., M.P., has  acted as our Chairman in the absence of Field Marshal The Lord Milne,who was unable to take part in the Committee&apos;s work in thepreparation of the Report, but  presided at the meetings whenthe broad principles of the recommendations  contained thereinwere considered.  The membership of the Committee has been increased by the inclusion  of Mr. G.  R. Hill, C.B., and sir frederick Liddell, K.C.B., K.C., who were appointed to theCommittee for the purpose of assisting in the consideration of the consolidation and amendment  of the law relating to watersupply.   These gentlemen were also appointed as members ofthe Sub-Committee dealing with those questions.  2. We informed your predecessor in our First Report  thatthe Sub-Committee which we had appointed to  consider pro-posals for the modernisation of the law  relating to water supply had made substantial progress  and were preparing a  Bill forthe purpose.  The Sub-Committee have now completed the drafting of this Bill and have  submitted a Report  which hasbeen endorsed by the Committee. The Report and the draft bill are subjoined to this Report.  The proposed Bill deals with the consolidation and amendmentof the various general Acts regulating  the supply of water bylocal Act water undertakers, and provides also for the simplification-tion of the procedure to  which those undertakers must conformif additional powers are required.           Procedure for obtaining new powers.  3. The principal amendment of the law suggested by the Com-mittee  is that,  provided there is agreement by all  interests concerned, statutory water undertakers  (except local authorities)should be enabled in future to obtain new powers by  Order ofthe Minister of Health, instead of by Provisional Order as underthe existing law.  In paragraph 9 of their Report and in their notes on Clause 1of the proposed Bill, the Sub-Committee explain the drawbacks   16659                                              A 2
of the existing system, including the cumbersome procedure withwhich the. water undertakers must comply if they find it neces-sary to  obtain new powers for the carrying on of their under-takings.  The simplification of this procedure is very desirable,and the measures suggested for the purpose will tend to improvepublic water supplies by reducing the expense and trouble whichhas to be incurred now before authority for necessary improve-ments can be obtained.  It should be emphasised in this connec-tion that although the amendments we have recommended willprovide a more economical and much  more expeditious methodof procedure from the point of view of water undertakers, the safeguards for local authorities and persons likely to be affectedunder the new procedure are no less adequate than those of theexisting law,,since the proposed  powers  do not extend to the compulsory acquisition of land or water rights, applications foralterations or amalgamations of undertakings can be made only if the interested undertakers are in agreement, and, finally, theright of appeal to Parliament is preserved if opposition by anyinterested person to an Order is not withdrawn.   Consolidation  and amendment of the  Waterworks Code.  4. The need for a new Waterworks  Code is well established.It is nearly a century since the provisions embodied  in the act of 1847 came into common use and although these  provisionshave since been freely amended by subsequent local legislation,there has been no general revision of  the Code since 1863, andno comprehensive revision since the Code  was first formed. our main concern has been  on the one hand to  provide  uniformpowers, as far as this is  possible, for all water undertakers, andon the other hand to secure that Special Act provisions adopted for the purpose shall be both suited to the requirements of theundertakers and  fair to the general body of consumers.   It is apparent that with a subject like water supply,  with its  manyramifications and the numerous local undertakings of varyingcharacter, it would be impossible to achieve complete uniformity of-legal powers.  It is considered, however,  that the new  Codewill achieve a substantial measure of uniformity, and that mostof the existing  anomalies  will be - removed when it becomesincorporated with the water undertakers&apos; Special Acts.   It is apparent, also,  that  the consolidation of the general statutesgoverning the supply of water by Special  Act water undertakersinto one Act of Parliament will be to the advantage of all persons concerned with the administration of water supplies.                    Compensation  Water.   5. The suggested&apos; amendments of the  existing law are fully explained in the  Report made by the  Sub-Committee ^   we desire, however,  to call especial attention to  Clause 14 of theFirst Schedule  of the - proposed Bill,  which deals with the
question  of  compensation  water  when  streams  are. to  beimpounded under Special Acts.  This subject has. been muchdebated in recent years, and there has been considerable differ-ence  of&apos; opinion  between water  undertakers  and  other  riverinterests as to whether&quot;the present practice is equitable.  The question was reviewed by the Joint Committee on WaterResources and Supplies in their  Final Report of 1936.   they pointed out that the practice, is to take the average  of the riverflow for three consecutive dry years, to deduct from it an allow-ance  for the loss due to  evaporation, absorption,  percolationand other causes,  and to provide that a  proportion of the flow  of  the stream equivalent to  one-third of the result so obtained should be sent down the  stream as compensation toriparian owners.  They stated that this rough and ready methodhad been unsatisfactory, and was  open to  certain  objections.They expressed the opinion  in paragraph 33 of their Reportthat although  immediate steps  should be taken  to  remedy the lack  of  statistical  information  and  other  reliable data, thefollowing considerations must apply both now and in the future,viz.:         (a) The amount of compensation water should be deter-    mined on the merits of each  particular case.       (&amp;) In assessing the amount, regard should be had to           (i)  the character and flow of the stream;          (ii) the extent to which it was used for industries,        fisheries,  etc.;           (iii) the probability of future  industrial  develop-        ment;           (iv) the protection of the rights  of riparian and         other landowners;          (v) the  minimum  proportion of  the   flow  below        which compensation  ought  not to be fixed in the        interests  both of public health and riparian owners.  We are in full  agreement with the Joint Committee on thisquestion,  and we suggest  that Parliament should  be recom-mended  to consider whether  the time  has not come  for theexisting practice  to be revised, and  whether  Standing orders should not be amended to provide that regard  should be hadto the foregoing  considerations when proposals entailing the assessment of compensation water are under consideration. Wesuggest,  also,  that it should be  made clear  that the  interestsof agriculture, land drainage, the prevention  of pollution and navigation should be taken into account.  6. We have emphasised the need for  the consolidation andamendment, of .the. law..relating to  water, supply..   We. suggestthat it would be in the interests of  all who are concerned with
public water supplies, whether water undertakers or consumers,if a Bill for the purpose could be introduced into parliament at the first practicable opportunity.                     We have the honour to be                             Sir,                         Your obedient Servants,                  ARTHUR P. HENEAGE, Chairman.                  A. R. ATKEY.

          Reservation by Mr. Reginald Heddington.   I am in general agreement with the Committee&apos;s Report, but I do not endorse the recommendations regarding the recovery of fines  for breaches of provisions as to compensation water (see paragraph 20 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report).   Fishery boards are often empowered  now  by local  Water Acts  to take proceedings and to recover penalties for breaches of these provisions.  The power to take proceedings is continued by Clause 14 (4)  of the First Schedule of the proposed. Bill, but it is proposed that penalties shall in future  be treated  as fines.  While I agree that it is generally desirable that penalties should be dealt with in this way, I consider that fishery boards are in a special position,  and that an exception should be made in their favour, at any rate so long as their existing obligations continue.   The  boards incur  considerable  expenditure  on policing  the rivers  within their  jurisdiction and on ensuring that the statutes relating to those rivers are complied with  in many instances  they  are the  only  authorities  employing staff  for this purpose.  On the  other hand, they  receive no contributions from local rates towards their expenses, notwith- standing that much of the  work is of direct or indirect benefit to interests  other than fisheries.  The special position of  fishery  boards was recognised  by Parliament in Section 73 of  the Salmon arid Freshwater Fisheries Act,  1923,  which provides that subject to the  provisions  of Section 5 of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914, any fines  or  moneys  recovered on the  complaint  of  a board, or officer or person authorised by a board,  shall (unless the court for some  special reason otherwise order) be paid  to the board and applied by them for the purposes of the Act.  I recommend that this principle be extended to  the fines proposed in Clause 14 of  the First Schedule of the Bill.                             REGINALD BEDDINGTON.          Reservation  by Mr. E. W. Cemlyn-Jones.  I am  in  agreement with the  Sub-Committee&apos;s reasons for deciding not to consider major alterations of the existing Codeas between water undertakers and  highway authorities.   I amdefinitely of the opinion, that, in view of the recent appointmentby  Parliarnent of the Joint Committee  on the  Breaking  upof Streets by Statutory Undertakers, it would be unappropriateto proceed with the provisions of  Part VI of the First Scheduleto the proposed Bill until the Joint Committee  has reported and  their  recommendations  have  been  considered by theGovernment.  The Bill should then be  reviewed in the lightof the decisions taken.                                 E. W. CEMLYN-JONES.  4th April,  1939.
                        PART II.   REPORT BY CONSOLIDATION SUB-COMMITTEE.  The Members .of the Sub-Committee were: Sir Albert Atkey(Chairman), Mr.  H.  K. Beale, Mr. J.  Chaston,  Lieut-Col.E. J. Clarke, Sir Robert Doncaster, Mr. G. R. Hill, Mr.  S. R.Hobday, Mr. J. E. James, Sir Frederick Liddell and Mr. B.Verity.                       REPORT.  I. We were appointed by the Committee to review the Water-works  Clauses  Acts of  1847  and 1863, provisions in special acts amending and extending the powers of those Acts, andthe other general  Acts from which statutory  water  undertakersderive  the powers to carry on their undertakings;  and to pre-pare a Bill for the consolidation of the law.  2. In an interim report of  progress made  to the Committeein  November,  1937,  we  submitted  details  of clauses  basedon  the Acts of 1847  and 1863 and  on local legislation, withother amendments of  the law, which we considered should be embodied in the  Bill.  Since  then, we have completed  ourreview of the  relevant  statutes,  and have  prepared a draftBill, which is appended  to this Report, embodying the amend-ments  already approved  by the Committee and the otheralterations of the  law  which we consider desirable.                       INTRODUCTION.  3. Approximately  four-fifths of the  public water suppliesof  England  and Wales is  afforded  by  local  authorities,joint boards and companies acting under  powers obtainedfrom Parliament  in Local Acts or Provisional Orders.   It  isthe usual practice for these Acts and  Orders to prescribe theworks  which may be  carried out and the lands which may be acquired, the sources  of supply which may be drawn upon, thelimits within which the water undertakers may  supply  water,the rates and charges to be made, the borrowing powers, and,in the  case of companies, the amount of capital which may beraised and the profits  which may be made.  In addition, nearly all the Acts or Orders incorporate the provisions of the Water-works Clauses Acts  of 1847 and 1863 the  general code  of clauses regulating the conditions of  public water  supply and include also special provisions modifying and extending thoseActs.            -   4. The remainder of  the public water  supply of the countryis  supplied  by local authorities  and joint  boards under  thepowers of the Public Health Act, 1936, which lays down  a
ITseparate and distinct procedure for carrying on water  under-takings (the powers being prescribed in the Act, and beingexercisable in certain respects with the consent of  the Ministerof Health), but is similar to the Waterworks Code to the extent that the Act incorporates the Act of  1863  (except Section 15)and, with some important modifications, the sections of the act of 1847 relating to the breaking up of streets, the laying of pipes,the waste or misuse of water, the fouling of water and the pay-ment and recovery of the water rates.  5. The powers of the Public Health Acts in relation to watersupply  were  reviewed as recently as  1936,  but the  provisionsof the Acts of 1847 and 1863 incorporated with  the Act of 1936were not then revised, pending a comprehensive examination ofthe Waterworks  Clauses  Acts  and amending local legislation.Our Report is directed, in the main, therefore, to the consolida-tion and amendment of the  general statutes  affecting water undertakers who  supply under powers  derived from  special acts, although it is recommended that certain of  the  clauses of the proposed Bill replacing or extending sections of the acts of 1847 and 1863 shall be incorporated with  the Act of 1936, totake the  place of  the  parts  of the existing Code now soincorporated.                  Form  of the  proposed Bill.  6. The general Acts which  we have  reviewed  fall into two categories:         (a) The Waterworks Clauses Acts of 1847 and 1863, which    do not come  into operation in local areas  unless they are    Incorporated with the Special Acts of the water undertakers    supplying  those areas ;       (&amp;) Acts  which are in  force without the  necessity for    incorporation with Special Acts.  It was considered necessary for this distinction to be preserved,as some provisions of the Acts in the former category might notbe applicable to  every undertaking, or  should  not be broughtinto operation  until the  undertakers had had sufficient  oppor-tunity of reviewing the financial and other circumstances  of their undertakings.  It was considered also that it would be  advan-tageous if the Acts in the latter category were included, as faras practicable, in one general Act.  The proposed Bill is divided,therefore, into  two main parts:         (i) Provisions to  be of  general application, without the    necessity for incorporation with existing general or  Special    Acts, which are included in the main body of the proposed    Bill;       (ii) The  First Schedule,  containing provisions for incor-    poration with future Water Acts  and Orders, which,  it is
    intended, shall be a new Waterworks Code to supersede the&quot;    Acts of 1847 and 1863.  We have also suggested that some  parts of  the new Codeshould be incorporated with the Act of 1936, to replace provisionsof the Acts of 1847 and 1863 now incorporated.                         PART I.               SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED BILL.                   The Waterworks Code.  7. Having reached these conclusions, we turned to the questionof the provisions which should be embodied in the proposed Bill.The principal Acts are the Waterworks Clauses Acts of 1847 and1863, which were based upon provisions adopted  in special acts of the period, and are, as we have indicated, incorporated,with or without modification, with the great majority of special acts and in part with the Act of 1936.  Nearly a century has passed since the clauses in this Code were first formulated.  Inthe  meantime, the conditions of public  water supplies  have changed so greatly that the scope of the Acts is now altogetherinadequate, while many of the provisions have become obsoleteby reason of later general and special legislation  on water supplyor on other subjects.  To some extent, the inadequacy of the code has been met  by  the undertakers themselves, who have obtained powers by Special Acts to suit their individual require-ments, with the result that there has grown up  a  large body of provisions  amending the  Code which are now recognised byParliament as common form clauses.  As may be expected, the wording  of  similar clauses often  varies very much, while thepractice of  leaving the initiative to local interests has sometimesproduced anomalies, both in powers and in procedure, for whichit is difficult to  find  justification.    Although the practice has enabled  the  water undertakers,  at  considerable trouble and expense, to obtain the powers necessary for the carrying  on oftheir undertakings, it has not been conducive to the uniformityand continuity of practice that is desirable for a service which isessential for public health and for the carrying on of  industryand commerce,  and has thus a  great influence on the welfare of the community;  it is probable,  moreover, that the widevariations in the language of  the common form  clauses  includedin Special Acts, which often  refer to earlier Acts for full  inter-pretation, do not help the consumer  to comprehend the extentof his rights and liabilities in connection with the supply ofwater.  It  is clearly  in the interests  of all concerned  that theexisting Code should be revised, and that the new provisions should  be  applied   as  uniformly   as  possible  to all  water undertakings.
  8. With these objects in view, we have examined the Water-works  Clauses  Acts in detail, the House of Lords&apos; Model bill and Clauses  and a great variety of the provisions  which are usually allowed in local legislation; we have also reviewed thereport  made  by the Advisory Committee  on Water in 1929;finally, we have compared, where feasible, the various provisionsexamined with similar provisions approved by Parliament in theAct of 1936.  The clauses submitted in the First Schedule of theproposed Bill comprise the most suitable of the provisions con-tained in the  sources to which we have referred.   The principalamendments  proposed are explained in detail in Part II of theReport.The Gas and Water Works Facilities Act, 1870, and the Gas and  Water Works Facilities Act, 1870,  Amendment Act, 1873.  9. The  Acts empowered the Board of Trade  to make Pro-visional Orders enabling companies or persons to construct and maintain gas  and water works and supply gas and water; toraise additional capital; to furnish joint supplies or amalgamatetheir undertakings;  and  to do  other things incidental  to the carrying on of those undertakings.  By Order in Council dated9th November, 1920, the powers of the Acts in relation to watersupply were transferred to  the  Minister of Health.   Havingregard to  the  wider  powers  contained in later general Acts theActs, so far as they relate to gas,are now practically superseded.It should be  emphasised that the Acts do not authorise theacquisition of  land (including easements) or water rights unlessthe owners concerned (including riparian owners if water rightsare in  question) have  agreed  to  the  terms  of acquisition,  and do  not confer compulsory powers for the acquisition of water undertakings.   Subject to these  qualifications, the Minister is empowered to make Provisional Orders for  most of the powers which  water  oompanies can  obtain  by Special  Acts.  Localauthorities and persons who object to the provisions of  a Pro-visional Order can,  if  they think  fit,  carry objections  whichhave not been met to Parliament, as in the case of private Bills.It is the  Ministers  practice,  we understand, not to includespecial  powers  for  the carrying  on of undertakings  unlesssimilar powers have been granted by Parliament in  special acts.   We understand, also, that of the 61. Provisional orders made since the powers of  the  Acts  were - transferred  to theMinister, four only  were opposed in  Parliament.  The pro-visions of  the Acts governing such matters as notices, advertise-ments, deposit of documents and publication  of ProvisionalOrders are  rigid and  expensive:  there are the  further  draw-backs that applications for  Provisional Orders  must be madeat a prescribed  period, which cannot be varied,  and that thevarious stages of the  proceedings,  both before and after  a
                            14                            CDProvisional Order is made, are conditioned by prescribed dates,which allow but little room for variation.  io. The necessity for a  Provisional Order, whether there isopposition or not,  and the procedure of the Acts are out of keeping with the requirements  of modern water supply.  TheCommittee were of opinion that the new powers recommended in their First Report should be exercisable by  Order,  after  alocal Inquiry, but  that Orders should be provisional if opposed by interested persons.  This procedure is very well  suited tothe purposes covered by  the Acts of  1870  and 1873, and werecommend that in future Orders for any  of the purposes men-tioned should be provisional only if they  are opposed, and theopposition has not been withdrawn.   In this  instance, the broadeffect of  the procedure  recommended   would  not&apos;  be  very different  from the existing position.   We have no doubt thatthe Minister&apos;s practice, to which  reference  has already beenmade,  of granting special powers  only  when&apos;  similar  powers have been approved by Parliament would be continued, moreespecially if there is a new Waterworks Code; the Orders would still be made on the initiative of the water undertakers; theacquisition of land and water  rights would be impracticable,unless the agreement  of interested owners was  obtained beforeapplication for an  Order was made; there would be an oppor-tunity for appeal to Parliament if any of the provisions (includ-ing those authorising  the  acquisition  of  land  or water rightsby agreement) were not acceptable  to any interest concernedafter the Order had been  made; it would be only where therewas  full  agreement that Orders would become operative with-out the necessity of confirmation by Parliament.  As we have indicated, the great majority  of the  Provisional Orders madesince 1920 have been unopposed in Parliament.  We think  it undesirable that water undertakers should be required to incur the expense  of Provisional Orders  in such  circumstances: weare satisfied  also that the requirements we have outlined will afford adequate safeguards for consumers and  other interests.Clause 1 of  the proposed  Bill gives effect to the procedurerecommended.     Water Companies (Regulation of Powers)  Act, 1887.  11. Section 74 of the Act of 1847, which  is also incorporatedwith the Act of 1936, authorises water  undertakers, whetherlocal authorities or companies, to cut off the water if the ratefor domestic purposes is not paid when due.  The Act of 1887makes it illegal for a water company to  exercise this power ifthe owner of the house is liable for payment of the water rate.   Section 74 of the Act of 1847 and the  Act of 1887 are repro-duced, with  some amendments, in  Clause 6  of  the proposed bill.  We have extended the prohibition  against cutting off
the water, where the owner is responsible for payment of thewater rate,  to  all water undertakers,  but with the importantexception that  it should not  apply if the owner is in occupa-tion.  Under  Section 4 of  the Act of 1887, the undertakers areempowered to charge the water rate due, together with interest,on the house in priority to all other charges.  It is very doubt-ful whether sums due for water rates should take priority overall other charges, including charges enforceable by local autho-rities under the Public  Health Acts or other general Acts, andwe  have  recommended, therefore, that the power  should be repealed.  The  Metropolitan Water Board are required by Section  98 ofthe Public Health (London)  Act, 1936, to  notify the sanitaryauthority if they cut off the water from any inhabited house in the County of London.  We consider that, in the interests ofpublic  health,  a similar obligation should be  imposed on allstatutory  water undertakers, and that the requirement shouldbe made of general application (Clause 7).  Water Undertakings  [Modification of  Charges) Act, 1921.  12.  The Act authorises the Minister to make Orders modify-ing water charges and awards or agreements determining such charges, to  meet increases in the cost and charges of under-takings attributable to  circumstances  arising  since the  out-break  of  the Great  War where  these are beyond the controlof, or could not have been reasonably avoided  by,  the under-takers.  Orders can  be made on the application of  the under-takers;  they are provisional if opposed by a  local authorityof an  affected  area  (or if the local  authority  are the under-takers, by twenty consumers) or if the Minister thinks desirable.Orders can be  amended on the application of the undertakers,interested local authorities,  or  consumers.  The  Minister  is empowered to  make rules  as to the procedure to be followed,and is  required to hold a local inquiry if objections are made and not withdrawn.   We understand that 174 Orders  havebeen made, of which four were  provisional, and that the lastOrder was made on the 23rd May, 1934. The conditions whichthe Act  was designed  to  meet have  now  become stabilised,and we consider that specific powers to meet them are no longer required.    We have  recommended  that  the  Act  should be repealed,  but that there  should be a  general  power for theMinister to vary rates and charges:  detailed reference is madein paragraphs  41  and  42  of the Report to the latter recom-mendation.          Reservoirs [Safety  Provisions) Act,  1930.  13.  The Act  imposes  precautions to be observed in the con-struction, alteration&apos; and use  of reservoirs designed to hold, or
                             16                             1capable of holding, more than five million gallons of water abovethe natural level of adjoining land, including requirements thatqualified civil engineers shall  design  them and supervise theirconstruction and alteration, and inspect them at regular intervalsto ensure that they are safe.  Also, that subject to an appeal toa referee appointed, in  default of  agreement,  by the Secretaryof State, the undertakers shall carry  out such measures as  are recommended by the responsible  engineer in the  interests  ofsaiety.  As  the Act applies to reservoirs other than those con-structed for the purpose of public water supply, it  would be impracticable to embody  the  provisions in the proposed Bill.             Supply of  Water in Bulk Act, 1934.  14. The Act empowers statutory water undertakers, with theconsent of the-Minister of Health,  to enter into agreements withany other statutory water undertakers for the giving or taking of supplies of water in bulk.  We have reproduced the provisionsof the Act in the proposed Bill (Clause 2). It has been customaryin recent local legislation to allow undertakers to take suppliesof water in bulk from  persons other than water undertakers:Sub-clause   (1) of  Clause  2  includes  this additional power.Section 1 (4) of the Act of 1934 contains special savings for theprotection of highway authorities, railway companies, and canal and inland navigation authorities.   We understand that a JointCommittee of Parliament is considering the law in relation to the breaking-up  of streets by  public  utility  undertakings,  and wehave deferred consideration of the question whether any revisionof the special saving for highway authorities  is required.   Asregards the other savings,  we suggest that the clause  shouldembody the provisions  we recommend for the laying of mainsand the breaking open of streets in paragraph 22 of the Report.                   Prevention of  Pollution.  15. The  existing  general powers for the prevention of  pollu-tion are contained in Section 61 of the Act of -1847, under whichit is an offence to bathe in any stream, reservoir or  other water-works belonging to the undertakers;  to wash or cause animalsto enter therein; to throw polluting  matter or wash materialstherein; to  cause the water of any  sink, sewer,  drain,  steamengine, boiler or other filthy water  to  run  or to be  broughttherein; or to do any  other act whereby the water is fouled.The provisions  afford  no  protection against polluting matterplaced in the subsoil in the vicinity of springs or undergroundsources. It has  been customary in modern  Special Acts for parliament to allow additional powers whereby the undertakersmay acquire land for the protection of water supplies, carry outworks on the land,  enter into agreements with landowners forthe carrying out of works on their land, and  make byelaws for preventing the pollution of water in the catchment area.
  Modern transport facilities attract large numbers of people to areas which were formerly remote from populous centres, andalso  encourage building development,  sometimes without ade-quate facilities for the disposal of sewage, in areas which wereagricultural in character a relatively short time ago.  In viewof these  considerations the Committee recommended in para-graphs 15 and 16 of Part II of their First Report that undertakersshould be given additional powers for the protection of publicwater supplies  from  pollution, and  that  for  this purpose thepowers of Section 61  of the Act of 1847 should be  extended tounderground supplies; tar and oil should be brought within thescope of that section; and provisions based  on Special  Acts,on the lines mentioned above, in regard to the purchase of land,the execution of drainage works and the making of byelaws forthe protection of gathering grounds should be available for allwater undertakers.   Effect to these  recommendations is  givenin Clauses 9 to 12 of the proposed  Bill.   It  is very desirablethat   water  undertakers  who  derive  supplies  from  under-ground sources should have adequate powers for protecting thesupplies  from the  risk of pollution,  and  we have accordinglyprovided that the  powers should be brought  into  operationforthwith, without the need for incorporation with Special Acts,and  that they should be  available for  all  statutory water undertakers.                         PART II.            REVISION OF THE WATERWORKS CODE.                    Part I Preliminary.               Supply for domestic purposes.  16. The principal duty of water undertakers is to secure thatthere is  a  sufficient  and  wholesome supply  for the domestic purposes of their consumers.  The existing Code does not define&quot; domestic purposes,&quot; although Section  12 of the  Act  of 1863excepts  from-those purposes  a supply of water for cattle; forhorses or washing carriages  where these are kept for sale orhire or by a common carrier; for trade, manufacture or business;and  for gardens, fountains and ornamental purposes.   local legislation on this  subject has varied greatly-at one time forinstance it was common practice to allow 1 additional charges for water-closets and baths.  This practice has been varied  in more recent Special Acts by the omission  of additional charges forany water-closets, or for the first fixed bath of ordinary capacity(this is usually not more than fifty gallons); it was again variedby Section 126 (3) of the Act of 1936, which does not allow anadditional charge for any fixed bath of ordinary capacity.   Ithas been customary  also in  Special Acts to allow additional   16659                                               A 6
charges for certain  uses of water in  private  houses,  e.g. forrefrigerators and water softeners, and for the watering of gardensor  cleansing of  vehicles by  means  of  hosepipes or similarapparatus.  We have suggested that instead of  following the practice ofthe Act of 1863  and of the Special Acts of excluding certaindefined purposes from the scope  of  the  domestic rate,  it is preferable to indicate clearly what purposes are included.  the definition  proposed for  this purpose is in Clause 1 of the first schedule.   We have followed the precedent of  the Act of 1936,by including all fixed baths of ordinary capacity in the domesticcharge. There has been some doubt, with consequent litigation,as to whether or not the use of water by an occupier of  a house in the  course of his  profession was covered by the water rate.We have provided that there shall be  no additional charge for water  so used in a  private house, of which part is used forprofessional purposes.  A  minor alteration is  the  inclusion ofwatering of gardens, provided that the water  is taken from atap inside the house  and a hosepipe or similar  apparatus is not used.  While the Act of  1863 authorises an additional charge for water so used, it is  very doubtful  whether charges are in factmade or could be enforced; and the usual practice, which it issuggested in Clause 51 of the first Schedule should be continued,is to allow an additional charge if hosepipes, etc., are used, orwater is taken from a tap outside the house. Similarly, the defi-nition  makes it clear that water used for  horses  or  for thewashing of vehicles kept for private use comes  within the scopeof domestic purposes only if it is  drawn from  a tap inside thehouse, and no hosepipe or similar apparatus is used.                 Part II Works and lands.  17.  Sections 6 to 17 of the Act of 1847 deal with the conditions to which the undertakers must conform in connection with theconstruction of works authorised  by  Special  Acts.  We  referbelow  in some detail to Section 6..  Sections 7 and 9 have  been omitted from the Bill.  They provide that errors in or omissionsfrom the plans and  book of reference deposited in connectionwith Acts authorising the compulsory acquisition of land may be corrected  or restored, after notice has been given to interestedowners, etc., on application to two justices, and for the depositof amended plans and documents,  the  effect being that the com-pulsory powers  of the  Special Act are extended to the  landsaffected.  It is considered that the sections  are pertinent to theacquisition of land  rather than to waterworks, and that pro-visions authorising the  compulsory acquisition  of land  must be contained in the  Special Act.  A new  clause following  modernSpecial Act provisions has been substituted for Section 11, which provides for deviations from the  approved plans  during thecourse of the work (Clause 3, First Schedule); Section 12 is now
 obsolete, and has been replaced by new clauses (Clauses 5 and. 101 of the First Schedule); Section  14, which provides for a forfeit to the undertakers, with a continuing forfeit of five pounds a day,  from any person illegally taking or diverting water from streams or supplies authorised by the Special Act, is omitted, in view of the very similar provision of Clause 70 (2) of the First Schedule and in accordance with the general recommendations of paragraph 36 of the Report; Section 15 which contains savings for owners and occupiers whose water rights are affected, or for compensation  in  lieu thereof, and  Sections  16  and  17 as  to accommodation works are also omitted, as it is  usual  for the Special Act to provide for these matters. We have included new clauses supplementing the Act of 1847  by additional powers to the undertakers for the acquisition of land by agreement and the use and retention of.land (Clauses 8 to 13, First Schedule).               Part III Compensation water.   18. Section 6 of the Act of 1847 provides for compensation to be made to  any person injuriously affected by the compulsory acquisition of land or water rights.  The section has now been largely superseded by the invariable practice of incorporating the Lands Clauses Acts with Special Acts authorising the com- pulsory acquisition of land, and, if  streams are impounded  by provisions in the Special Acts based on Clause 5 of the House of Lords&apos;  Model  Water Bill.  This clause provides that where e stream is  impounded, the undertakers shall deliver  from the reservoir a prescribed quantity of water in every working day of 24 hours in a continuous flow at the point specified in the Special Act; that gauges shall be installed for., measuring the water so delivered; and for penalties for breaches of the con- ditions.  Provision is also made for measuring the flow of the water during the construction  of  the  reservoir; and for the undertakers  to be prohibited from taking water from the stream so long as the flow is less than the rate prescribed in the  Special Act.  The foregoing, provisions are to be accepted as full com- pensation for all water taken, except in  respect of lands between the foot of the embankment of the reservoir and the point of discharge of the compensation  water.  The Special Act practice as to penalties for breaches of these conditions varies consider- ably.    The  more  common  provisions  contain  continuing penalties,  payable  to  all  persons  affected;  other examples provide for payment of a continuing penalty to a river authority, e.g., the fishery or catchment board;  there are  instances of a penalty payable to a river authority,   with compensation for damage to persons affected; and there are examples of a con- tinuing penalty but with no mention of the persons by whom it may be recovered.  The amounts of the penalties in the Acts we have examined cover a wide range, being as low as  5 and as high as  250.    16659                     .                          A 7
  ig. Clause 14 of the First Schedule follows recent Special Actprovisions with the undermentioned alterations.  In Sub-clauses(2)  and (4) it is provided that the  position, type  and size  ofgauges shall be approved by the Minister  of Agriculture andFisheries, the object being to obviate the use of unsatisfactorytypes, and to ensure that regular records are kept of the flow of the stream, as well as of the quantity of water delivered tothe  stream, where this is practicable and reasonable.  A minoramendment in  Sub-clause  (3) provides that any records  madeshall be kept and shall be open to the inspection of all persons interested.   In  Sub-clause (4) it is made clear  that catchmentand fishery boards are interested bodies for all purposes of theclause:  they are thus empowered to  institute proceedings  for breaches &quot;of the prescribed conditions.  20. The  principal  amendments relate to penalties  for breaches of the conditions prescribed by the Special Act.   The Committeehas already endorsed the  principle  of these recommendations,but we think it  desirable to recapitulate the considerations  whichhave influenced us, viz.: that a riparian  owner has limitedrights of property only in the water of a river; and, on the otherhand, that there may be a temptation under the existing pro-cedure for the undertakers to keep  back compensation  waterwith the knowledge that  complaints can be met by the paymentof small sums  to those owners who voice  their objections, oreven to a single river authority.&apos;  The conclusions reached were that the interests of river usersas a body  would be best served if penalties were heavy enoughto be a deterrent, but that it would be clearly impracticable toallow recovery of penalties by any or every interested person iflarge penalties were to be prescribed; it was considered,  more-over, that  it was undesirable in principle that persons should beentitled to recover penalties irrespective of  whether or not theyhave actually  sustained damage.  With these considerations in mind,  we have provided for  continuing fines not exceeding^500 for breaches of the conditions  as to compensation  water,and  50 for breaches of the conditions as to gauges, and forthe penalties not to be recoverable in future by any particularauthority or interest, but to be regarded as  fines for breaches ofthe law.   The former penalty  would be too large to warrantproceedings being  taken in&apos;a court of summary jurisdiction,which is the procedure  we have generally recommended;  it isprovided,  therefore, that if  the full penalty is sought to been forced  the proceedings must  be  by indictment,  and  that ifproceedings are taken in  a court of summary jurisdiction,  themaximum fine shall be ^50.   It is considered also that the usualrequirement that the undertakers shall be liable by civil processfor any loss or damage sustained by persons affected by  defaulton their part should be  continued.
          Part IV Minerals underlying waterworks.  21. Sections 18 to 27 of the Act of 1847 regulate the positionof the undertakers in relation to mining interests and enablethem, subject to payment of compensation, to prevent the work-ing of minerals under or near their works;  or when  mines areworked,  provide safeguards  against working in  an unusualmanner.   Any question of a revision of these  provisions shouldbe considered only in conjunction with similar protection afforded to local authorities and other public utility  undertakers, andwith mining  law generally.  Such an investigation is, in  ouropinion, outside the scope of a revision of the Waterworks Code;it  is recommended,  therefore,  that  the   powers  should bere-enacted (Clauses 15 to 22, First Schedule).             Part  V Power to lay- mains, etc.             Part VI Breaking open streets, etc.  22. Section 29 of the Act  of 1847, prohibits undertakers from entering on private land, except for the repair or replacement of existing authorised works, unless the consent of owners andoccupiers  is  obtained.  The Committee recommend in  para-graph 9 of Part III of their First Report that this prohibitionwas no longer desirable in the interest of public water supplies,and that Special Act water  undertakers, whether local authori-ties or companies, should be given the powers  (already vested in local authorities  supplying  water under the  Act  of 1936)  oflaying their mains in,  on or over private land, the power being subject to the payment of compensation for any damage caused,or suffered,  and to the savings of the Act of-1936 in favour ofland and streets  belonging to railway companies and  other statutory  undertakers.  Effect has been given to this recom-mendation in Clauses 23, 24 and 29 of the First Schedule of theproposed  Bill,  which  apply provisions similar to  those of theAct of 1936  amending the  Act of 1847, to all statutory  water undertakers,  and  in  Clause 1 of that Schedule,  in  which the definition of &quot; street &quot; refers to the definition in the  PublicHealth Act,  1936, and so covers  private streets.  We  havesuggested, however,  that the power to enter on  private land should not be exercisable unless the owner&apos;s consent is obtained,but that consent should not be unreasonably withheld.   We have provided, also, that  compensation to landowners  should  be assessed by  an arbitrator,  appointed in  default  of  agreement by the Minister,  in accordance with the  procedure of the act of 1936, but have not applied the provisions as to betterment inSection 278 (4) of that Act, as these are not considered suitablefor Special Act undertakers (Clause 23).   In view of the enquiry instituted by a  Joint  Committee ofboth Houses  of  Parliament into the powers of public  utilityundertakers to break up public streets, we  have decided  not to
consider major alterations of the existing Code as between water undertakers and highway authorities.  Sections 28 and 30 to 34of the Act of 1847 are accordingly reproduced, with some minor alterations, in  Part VI of the First Schedule.                    Obligation to Supply.    (a) Part VII Supply of water for domestic purposes.  23.  The undertakers are required by Section 35 of the Act of1847 to maintain a  sufficient supply of pure and wholesomewater for the domestic use of those consumers who are  entitledto demand a supply and are willing to pay the authorised water rates.  A requisition for a supply is binding on the undertakers(who must lay necessary mains and pipes) if the aggregate water rates which will  be payable by the persons demanding a supply will amount to not less than one-tenth of the initial cost of pro-viding and laying the pipes, and those persons agree severallyto take the supply for  at least three consecutive years.   Theobligation  of  the undertakers to lay the  necessary  mains, if required to do so by prospective consumers, is reproduced, butwe have recommended  that one-eighth shall be  substituted forone-tenth  (Clause 32, First Schedule).  This amendment hasbeen approved by Parliament on many occasions in local legis-lation since the War, and is now generally accepted as  meetingthe altered conditions of water undertakings.  The requirementsof Section 35 of  the Act of 1847 as to sufficiency and purity are reproduced in Clause 34.  24. Under Section  123 of the Act of 1936, local  authoritieshave power to agree with water undertakers that if the aggre-gate amount of the water rate is not sufficient for consumers to demand  a  supply,  they will guarantee the payment  of  anydeficiency in consideration of the mains being extended to theareas in need  of a supply.  There is, however, no obligation onthe water  undertakers  to enter  into such  an agreement.  Weconsider that  water undertakers should not be in a position torefuse to furnish a supply for domestic purposes to any propertywithin their limits of supply if they receive a  guarantee  thatthe authorised  return  on  their  capital  outlay  will  be forth-coming.   We have provided that  where the local  authorityundertake  to  pay any deficiency until such time as the under-takers receive from the consumers the amount that would have enabled  a  requisition to be made, the  undertakers shall berequired to lay necessary mains  and pipes and  afford  thesupply, and that the obligation shall be of general application(Clause 4).     (b) Part  VIII Supply of water for public purposes.  25. Section 37 of the Act of 1847 requires the undertakers,where fire  plugs are provided, to supply water on agreed terms
 and conditions for cleansing sewers and drains, cleansing and watering  streets, and for  supplying public pumps, baths and washhouses:  Section  42 of the Act requires them in  similar circumstances to supply water, free  of cost, for extinguishing fires.  The obligation to supply for the foregoing public pur- poses is continued in Part VIII of the First Schedule.  We have considered whether  it should be  of general application, and have come to the conclusion that the requirements are not suited to  the supply  of  water in most  rural districts.           (c) Supply of water for other purposes.   26. While there are examples in Special Acts of a require- ment to supply for trade and other purposes,  the usual practice is not to impose any obligation, but to allow the undertakers to supply on such terms and conditions as they think fit, subject, however, in the majority of  cases to  a maximum charge for metered  supplies. It  has  been  represented to us that it would be desirable if the obligation to supply for domestic and public purposes  were extended to non-domestic purposes; and that the question whether the terms  and conditions required  by the undertakers were reasonable  should  be  decided, in the event of  dispute, by  an impartial  tribunal.   Industries using large quantities  of water   often rely very  largely upon supplies afforded  by  statutory  water  undertakers in  areas  where alternative sources have already  been  appropriated - this  may be the only course open to a new industry  or to an existing firm requiring additional  supplies.  The tendency  to rely  on statutory  water undertakings for industrial  supplies  is  likely to be increased if effect is  given to the  recommendations of the Committee in their First Report on  underground water,  as it would no doubt be  impracticable in some - districts for  a new industrial undertaking to abstract water from underground with- out interfering with the yield from existing boreholes.  We are agreed that it is reasonable that persons requiring water for trade and similar purposes should be able to  demand a  supply on reasonable terms  and conditions,  but we  consider that the supply for domestic requirements must be the first charge  on the resources of the  undertaking, and that the  undertakers should not, therefore, be  obliged to  afford a supply for  non- domestic purposes if  there is  a likelihood,  regard being hadboth to existing and probable future demands,  that the supply for domestic requirements  would be endangered.  We considerthat in all the circumstances the Minister of  Health would  be best able to decide this question and whether terms  and condi-tions were reasonable, and we have provided, therefore,  for  an appeal to him if it  is represented that  the  undertakers have acted unreasonably in refusing to supply for non-domestic pur- poses, or if there is any  dispute as to the terms and conditions (Clause 5).  This provision also is made of general application.
   Part X-Laying and  maintenance of supply pipes  and                   communication pipes.                   Part XI Stopcocks.  27.  Sections 48 to 52 of the Act of 1847 deal with the laying of pipes from the consumers  property to  the  mains  of theundertaker.   Broadly speaking, a new consumer requiring a supply for domestic purposes has the right, on payment of the portion of the water charge payable in advance, to open upthe ground and lay a pipe of such bore, strength and materialas may be prescribed by regulations of the undertaker, to con-nect his premises with the main of the undertaker, and to obtain a supply of water, provided that he has given the undertakerfourteen days&apos; notice of his intention and, if there is any landbelonging to other persons between his premises  and the main,he  has obtained the- consent of&apos;the owner;  he  is  expresslyauthorised for the purpose to break up so much of any streetas lies  between  the  main and  his premises, but must do  as little damage as possible, and pay compensation for any damage done.   The connection with the main must be made under thesuperintendence  of the water undertakers, subject to appeal to two justices in cases of dispute.  The  consumer who has laidthe pipe, or who has become the proprietor of it, is responsiblefor its maintenance, and he  may remove it, after due notice to the undertakers and  subject to  compensation for  damagesustained by them, but is not expressly authorised to break upstreets for these purposes.  These provisions were amended,  in respect to Public HealthAct water undertakings, by  Section 121 of the Act  of 1936,which empowers consumers to  break open streets for the pur-pose  of maintaining and renewing communication pipes, and gives  local  authorities, if they so desire, the exclusive  rightto lay  new communication  pipes,  with power  to recover thecost from the consumer.  28.  In the case of Special  Act undertakings, the consumersresponsibility for laying  and maintaining the pipe between hispremises and the main remained unaltered until comparativelylately, though many of the Special Acts provided for the under-takers having the sole right of making the actual connection between the pipe and the main.  In 1932, however, the Metro-politan Water Board initiated a system by which the responsi-bility was divided between  the Board  and. the consumer, theformer becoming liable for laying down at the latter&apos;s expense,and  keeping in repair at their own expense, so  much of theservice pipe as  lay  between the main  and  the  stopcock, or ifthere was no stopcock, between  the  main  and  the premisessupplied.  This  system,  with  modifications,  has since  beenadopted by  several large water undertakers, the broad  effect
being that the  undertakers are responsible  for work involving the breaking up of streets (the initial cost of the communicationpipe being recovered from the consumer), and that the consumeris relieved of the responsibility for maintaining the part of theservice pipe under the street.  This division of responsibility is well  suited to modern con-ditions.    So far as the work itself  is  concerned,  the  higher standard  of  modern  highway   construction entails  greaterexpense and difficulty in opening and reinstating  the road, withthe risk of permanent damage to the road structure if this work is  not carried out by expert labour; the damage to the watermains  from connections  made by inexperienced workmen isavoided; there is usually less interference with traffic when localauthorities  or  statutory  undertakers are  solely responsible;finally, it is to be expected that the work will be better executed,and that the materials used will be more durable and standard-ised.   As  regards  the  cost of maintenance,  the consumer is responsible, both under the Act of 1847 and under the Act of1936, for damage caused by heavy modern traffic, a risk whichvaries greatly  as between one road  and another according tothe amount of  traffic, the nature of the surface of the highway,the position of the main and other factors.   It is clearly inequit-able that the individual consumer should  be made responsiblefor repairing damage arising  from considerations of this kind,which he cannot control  and may not be able to foresee, andthe fairer method is to spread the cost over the  whole body of consumers, by placing the responsibility  on  the undertakers.The Advisory  Committee  on Water recommended in  theirReport of 1929 that the cost of providing communication pipes,as well as maintenance,  should be borne by the undertakers.We consider that it would be unfair to the  general body of consumers, of  whom the  great majority have defrayed the costof laying the  whole  service pipe  between the mains and theirpremises, if owners of new houses were relieved of the initialcost,  and that &quot;the fairer course  is to follow  the precedent ofprivate street  works, under which the first cost is borne by thefrontagers, and the cost of maintenance thereafter by the  general body of ratepayers.  Clauses 43, 44 and 47 of the First Schedulegive effect  to  these  recommendations.  The  Second Scheduleincorporates the clauses with the Act of 1936.  The foregoing recommendations relate only to service  pipesfor domestic  supplies.   A person taking a  supply  for non-domestic  purposes would usually have  no  statutory right  nowto break up the street, and as the terms and  conditions of thesupply would be matters for agreement, the undertakers wouldbe able, therefore, to secure that  they were exclusively  respon-sible  for the work, both  in the first  place, and  if repairs were required.  We have  provided in Clause 5  (3) of the proposed
Bill that Clauses 43, 44 and 47 of the First Schedule shall applyto non-domestic supplies in areas where they are applicable to domestic supplies.  Sections 44 to 47 of the Act of 1847, empowering the under-takers in consideration of a rental to lay communication  pipesto small houses; and Sections 48 to 52 of that Act, which enablethe consumer to break up the street and connect with the mainsfor the purposes of a  domestic supply are no longer required,and have not been reproduced.  29. It is the  modern waterworks practice to provide a stop-cock  on the service pipe between the main and the  premisessupplied, so that the  water can be turned off without severingthe pipe if repairs  are necessary, or the house is unoccupied.The practice increases somewhat the initial cost of providing a supply, but this drawback is outweighed by  the other advan-tages afforded to the consumer.  In view of these considerations,we have  recommended in the  First Schedule that  every new service  pipe should include a stopcock  (Clause 48);  and thatthe cost should be recoverable from the  consumer (Clause 44).It is also considered that the undertakers should be empoweredto fix stopcocks on existing service pipes, if they think fit,  butthat it would be unreasonable, in that event, for the cost  to berecoverable from the consumer  (Clause 48).  Although it is common practice for Special Acts to empower the undertakers to require a stopcock, the position in which itmay  be fixed varies  considerably.  It is more usual for  theposition to be in the street, as near the boundary as practicable,but an  alternative course in some recent Acts has been for thestopcock to be fixed, where practicable, in the premises supplied,as near as possible to the boundary of the street, or if this  is notfeasible, in the street, as near to the boundary as practicable.We have adopted the latter course as being less likely to give riseto accidents or  interference by unauthorised persons; and have endeavoured to secure as  far as possible that the stopcock is part of the communication pipe, and that that pipe shall be the portion of the service pipe between the main and a point as nearas practicable  to the  point where  the  service pipe enters thepremises supplied.   The effect of the recommendations is that the stopcock  willusually be fixed in the premises supplied, as near the boundary of  the  street  as practicable,  and  will  be  the  terminationof the  communication pipe, of which it will form part:  stop-cocks on existing pipes  complying  with this requirement  willalso be deemed to be part of the communication pipe.  It hasbeen necessary, however, to provide  for the following excep-tional conditions.   Where there is no garden or forecourt, theservice pipe will enter a building through an outer  wall  and
it will be impracticable to fix the stopcock in the premises.  Insuch cases, it will be in the street, as near to the boundary aspossible, and the communication pipe  will terminate at the boundary of the street. There is another type of property, wherethe service pipe enters the premises through a cellar which is partly under the street.  It would be unreasonable to regard thecellar wall as  the boundary  of  the  premises  supplied, or torequire  the undertakers to fix the stopcock in the  street,  at apoint near the  point of entry, which might be  in the roadway.It is provided  that in such cases the stopcock shall be in thecellar, but part of the communication pipe. There may be cases,also, where the stopcock is in.the premises, but some distance from the boundary of the street, or where the  premises do notabut on the street in which the main is  laid and there is thus along length of service pipe in a street.  It would be clearlyunreasonable, in such circumstances, to require the  undertakersto maintain the whole length of service pipe; it is provided thatin these cases the communication pipe shall be deemed to termination-nate at the boundary of the  street or part of a street in whichthe main is laid,  and that in the  former case the stopcock  shallnot be deemed to be part of the  communication pipe.   Finally,there is the example of  an existing  service pipe with no stop-cock, or with a stopcock in the footpath.  In both contingenciesthe communication  pipe  will be deemed to terminate at the boundary of the  street in which  the  main is laid; in the latter,the existing stopcock will be deemed to be part of the pipe.  (Seethe definition of &apos;&apos; communication pipe &apos;&apos; in Clause i of the  first schedule; and Clause 48 of that Schedule.)                                              s   The effect  of the foregoing  recommendations is that the con-sumer  will no longer require to break up the street for thepurpose of laying his communication pipe the  work being  doneby the undertakers at his expense and that he will be  relieved of all responsibility for maintaining the pipe.   There will  be cases,  however, particularly  in  rural areas,where  houses  are sometimes considerable  distances from the streets in which the mains are laid, of a consumer desiring to repair  an existing supply pipe under the highway,  or to lay anew supply pipe in the highway.   We have  indicated that itwould  be unreasonable to require the undertakers to bear theresponsibility of maintaining such pipes, and that it is undesir-able, on the other hand, that the consumer should be empoweredto carry out works entailing the breaking up of the highway. Wehave provided, in the circumstances,  that the undertakers shouldbe exclusively responsible for the laying and maintenance of thepart of the supply pipe under the highway, but should be ableto.recover the reasonable expenses incurred from the consumer(Clauses 44 (1), 46 (2) and 47 (2) ).
  It may  also happen  that  in  the  interests  of  good wateradministration the undertakers would rather lay a branch mainthan a small bore supply pipe to a house which is some distance from the street in which the service main is laid.  They wouldbe entitled to do so under the existing law, but would be unable,in the  absence of agreement,  to  obtain any contribution fromthe consumer, notwithstanding that he would be relieved of theexpense of providing the part of the supply pipe under  the highway.  To  meet such cases, it is provided that if the under-takers elect to  lay a branch main in lieu of any part of a supplypipe under the highway, they may do so and recover from theconsumer  the  expenses  which would have been incurred if  a supply pipe had been laid (Clause 44 (1)  and (3) ).            Part XII-Water Rates  and Charges.  30. Sections 68 to 74 of the Act of 1847 and Section 21 of theAct of  1863 deal with the payment and recovery of rates for thesupply of water for domestic purposes.  Except for the powers for recovery (including a power to cut off the water) of the two latter sections, they have been virtually  superseded in recentyears by special provisions of Water Acts.  These sections  are reproduced in Sub-clauses (3) and (4) of Clause 6 of the Bill,which, however,  prohibits the cutting off of the water if  theowner is liable for the rate and is not in occupation (see para-graph 11 of the Report).  There are no express powers  in the existing Code for  theundertakers to afford a supply for non-domestic  purposes,although,  as we  have  stated in  paragraph 16 of  the Report,Section 12 of the Act of 1863 excludes certain purposes from thescope of the domestic rate, while other sections of the same Act,such as 14  and 15, which give powers for the  hiring of metersand of entry for inspecting them,  demonstrate clearly that non-domestic supplies were  then customarily authorised by  theSpecial Acts.  31. Broadly  speaking,  the  usual  practice for charging  for water in modern  Special Acts is to provide for (a) a supply for domestic purposes with  a maximum rate, and  sometimes withscales of charges  differing according to the value of premises there is usually provision also for  a minimum charge; (&amp;) maxi-mum additional charges for purposes connected with privatehouses which  are  outside the scope of the domestic rate, e.g.,the use of hosepipes for watering gardens; (c) charges by meterwith  a minimum flat   rate  for quasi-domestic  supplies  toproperties  using  large  quantities of water, or  if  apparatusrequiring considerable quantities of water is  installed;  (d)  a power  to furnish metered supplies by agreement for domestic purposes;   (e)  a  power  to supply by  meter for non-domestic purposes on such terms  and conditions as the undertakers think
fit, coupled usually with a maximum price per thousand gallons.It is clearly impracticable for a general Act to prescribe maxi-mum or minimum rates and charges which would apply to the varying  circumstances of the  large number of water under-takings in the country, but certain of the  common powers forthe purposes we have outlined are suitable for general applica-tion, and these are included in the proposed Bill (Clauses 49 to54, First Schedule).  A general power to supply for non-domestic purposes is contained in Clause 5.  Under Section 68  of the Act of 1847 the domestic water rateis payable  according  to the  annual  value&apos; of the  tenementsupplied, any dispute as to the value being determined by twojustices.   Past practice in local legislation on  this  subject hasvaried very much,  and  although  the  majority of undertakershave now adopted a basis which is readily ascertainable fromthe valuation list in force for the time being in the area supplied,this is sometimes  &quot; net annual value &quot; and sometimes &quot; grossannual value,&quot; while there are still areas, we are. informed,  inwhich the water rate is chargeable on the rack rent  or on an estimated rental.   We consider that there should be uniformity of practice in this  respect in future, and have followed the act of 1936 by providing that the water rate should be chargeableon the net annual  value of the  premises supplied, as appearing in the valuation list in force at the beginning of the rating year,or where the value is not stated, that it should be determined, incase of dispute, by a court of summary jurisdiction  (Clause 49,First Schedule).  We have also considered it desirable to provide for domesticsupplies  to premises  used for business, trade or manufacturingpurposes, which are  required to provide sanitary and washingfacilities for their  employees, and use water for cleaning and sometimes for cooking purposes. Clause 33 of the First Scheduleprovides that a supply may be demanded if water is required for domestic purposes  in such premises.  The parts of the premisesused for these purposes are often a relatively small portion of thewhole of the property, and it would be unreasonable  to charge the water rate on  the full net annual value of the whole of thepremises supplied.  It is  provided, therefore, in Clause 49 (2)of the First Schedule that the net annual value  shall be deemedto be an apportioned fraction of the total net  annual value, andthat in default of  agreement, the question shall be determinedby  a court  of  summary jurisdiction.   Where considerable quantities of water  are  used in trade premises for  domestic purposes, the water undertakers may prefer to supply  by meter.Provision is made for  this in Clause 52 of the First  Schedule,which provides that they shall not be bound to supply otherwise than by meter, and that  they may make a minimum quarterlycharge not exceeding one-fourth of the  amount which would
be payable if a water rate were charged on the net annual valueof the part of the premises in which water is used for domestic purposes.Part XIII Provisions for preventing waste,  etc., of water and              as  to meters and other fittings.  32. Increased  consumption of water due  to waste is one ofthe most acute problems of the water undertaker, and may evennecessitate, in the absence of adequate powers of control, addi-tional capital  expenditure on new works for the improvementof pressure or for the augmentation of resources.  The Acts of1847 and 1863 contain very few powers  for  control.   To meetthe lack of general powers, water undertakers have obtained anumber of special powers, the result being that although certain provisions are now commonly allowed in local legislation, the language  of  sections conferring  the  same powers often  variesconsiderably.  It is desirable in the interests both of the under-takers  and of the consumers that the powers for the purpose should be standardised as much as possible.  The  existing general provisions  for the control of the wasteor misuse of water are Sections 54 to 60 of the Act of 1847 and sections 16 to 20 of the Act of 1863.  Section 16 of the Act of1863 which enables the undertakers to cut off the water if thereis waste or misuse has not been reproduced  (see paragraph 35of the  Report);  we have  reproduced the other sections  in theFirst Schedule of the Bill  with  amendments to  which detailedreference is made in the Appendix to the Report.  In addition,we have  included provisions in the First  Schedule, based  on special Acts and the Act of 1936,  empowering the undertakersto make byelaws for preventing waste (Clause  64); to supplywater  fittings (Clause 66); and to  provide meters and  otherapparatus for detecting waste (Clause 75).  Part XIV Pollution of water  by manufacture, etc., of gas.  33. Sections 62 to 67 of the Act of 1847 deal with this ques-tion.   Under  Section  62, it  is  an offence  if gas undertakersallow gas washings or other substances produced in making orsupplying gas to be brought or flow into any waterworks belong-ing to the undertakers: under Section 64 it is an offence if water supplies of the undertakers are fouled by the gas of any personmaking  or supplying  gas.   The  Committee recommended inparagraph 15 of Part II of their First Report that the provisionsof Section 62  should be made applicable to underground water.Effect  is given to this recommendation in Clause 76 of  the first schedule.  The  other  sections are reproduced in Part XIV ofthat Schedule.Part XV Financial provisions applicable  to water companies..  34. We have recommended that Sections 75 to 82 of the act of  1847 should be replaced by  Clauses  79 to 81 of the First
Schedule, which are based on modern Special Acts.  The effectof those sections is  that the dividend payable  by a statutorywater  company trading for profit must not exceed  the rateprescribed in the Special Act, or, if no rate is prescribed, 10 percent, of the paid-up  capital, unless a larger dividend is requiredto make up deficiencies on previous years.  The excess over theamounts required for this purpose is to be devoted to the forma-tion of a reserve fund, the limit to which may be prescribed inthe Special Act, or, if none is prescribed, is one-tenth of the nominal capital.  This fund is available for the equalisation of dividends and to  meet  any extraordinary claims certified byjustices.  In addition,  Section 122 of the Companies- ClausesConsolidation Act of 1845, which applies to most statutory watercompanies,  empowers  the directors to set aside, without limita-tion, sums  for contingencies  or  for  enlarging,  improving  and repairing works.   The clauses which  we have  substituted for  these  Sectionsfollow provisions which are now commonly-allowed in special acts.   The principal alterations are        (a) the maximum dividend on future capital is not to    exceed 7 per cent. (Clause 79 (6) );       (&amp;) the undertakers to have a discretionary power to form    a  reserve fund, whether  clear profits are sufficient or not    for  the  payment  of  dividend  at the  prescribed  rate    (Clause 80 (1) (a) );       (c) a power to set up a contingency fund to be included    in the new Code (Clause  80 (1) (b) );       (d) the two funds to be treated collectively, and a limit    set on their aggregate total the suggested limit is 15 per cent.    of the capital expended (Clause 80 (3) );       (e) subject to this limit, the aggregate amount carried to    the two funds in any one year not to exceed   per cent, of    the expended capital (Clause 80  (4) );       (/) the amount to be carried forward in any one  year not    to exceed the  sum required  for  payment  of authorised    dividends and interest not paid in that year;  the maximum    amount which can lawfully be distributed in dividends on    the preference and ordinary capital  for the following year;    and an amount equal to the total sum due for the following    yeat  as  interest  on  mortgages   or   debenture  stock    (Clause 81  (1) );       (g) any balance of profit after this carry forward to be    applied towards the reduction of water rates or charges in    future  years (Clause 81  (2) ).   The amendment suggested in (&amp;) strengthens the hands of the  -undertakers in building up reserves  which, when coupled  withthe provision for payment of dividends in arrears, assists to putundertakings on a sounder financial  footing than is possible in
                   General Amendments.                   Power to cut off water.  35. Under the existing Code and local legislation, the under-takers are empowered for certain offences of the consumer, orfor failure on his part to pay sums due,  to turn off or cut offthe water at his  expense.   In the Act of 1847, the power isgiven, by Section 54  if cisterns are not provided or kept in good repair  in houses to which there is no obligation to furnish a supply under constant pressure, under Section 57 if an autho-rised officer  of the undertakers is refused  entry for the purposeof examining whether there is waste or misuse of water,  andunder Section 74  if the water  rate is not paid at the time due;by  Section 16 of  the  Act of 1863, it is extended to  consumerswho wrongfully do or cause  or permit  to be done, anything in contravention  of any Special  Act, or wrongfully neglect todo  anything which ought to  be done under  Special Act pro-visions, for  the prevention of waste, misuse,  undue consump-tion,  and contamination of the water; in many Special Actsrecovery of sums due to the undertakers for  work done onbehalf of the consumer  (e.g., the provision or  repair of pipesand apparatus), is enforceable in the same manner as the waterrate,  which  includes a power to cut off the  water  if the rates are not paid.  Cutting off the  water, and the consequent failure of sanitaryarrangements may very well lead to  injury  to the  health  ofpersons in the house concerned, who have no responsibility forthe failure to pay the sums due or  for the offences  committed;the effects may spread to other consumers who have fulfilledall  their obligations to  the undertakers.   We  consider that  thepowers referred  to in the preceding  paragraph, which  wereformulated before the importance  of water supply  in relationto public health was  fully appreciated, are now obsolete,  andwe  have adopted the principle  throughout the proposed  bill that the water should  be cut off only when a consumer who is responsible for payment of water rates or charges fails to pay.We have recommended that all  other sums  due to  the under-takers should be  recoverable  as civil debts,  and that offencesmany cases under the existing Code, under which a reserve maynot be created until the full dividends, including arrears, if any,have been paid.    It is considered, also, that the limit on theannual amounts which can be  carried to the reserve and con-contingency funds, and the restriction on the amounts which can becarried forward, while enabling the undertakers to make suffi-cient provision for all purposes of the undertaking, will provide,at the same  time,  a safeguard  against excess  profits beingdevoted otherwise  than to the early benefit of the consumer.
under the Act, the Special Act,  or byelaws made thereunder,should be  dealt with  as  breaches of the law, punishable  byfines.                          Penalties.  36. There  are  varying  provisions in the existing Code, asamended by local legislation, for the imposition of penalties andfines, but,  broadly  speaking, they fall  into  the following catergories:        (a) Provisions for  forfeits  to the undertakers,  coupled     sometimes with continuing forfeits, for breaches of  condi-     tions imposed  by the Special Acts.  Examples of  simple     forfeits in the  Act of 1847 are to be found  in  Section 55,     (penalty for suffering cisterns, etc., to be out of repair);     Section 58 (for allowing unauthorised  use of water) ;  Sec-     tion 59  (for taking water without agreement): examples.     of continuing forfeits are to  be found in Section 61  (for     causing  the water to  be fouled).; and  Sections  62 and 63     (fouling of water by gas undertakers).   Whether these     forfeits were intended, in the first place,  to  be commuted     damages is not clear, but there is only one example in the     Act of  1847 (Section  14)  of express provisions  saving the     right of the undertakers to take proceedings for damages.     in addition to the recovery of a forfeit.       (&amp;) Provisions  for  forfeits by the undertakers to  con-     sumers or aggrieved  persons.   Examples  of these  in the     Act of 1847 are to be found in Section 36  (neglect to lay     pipes or  provide  a  sufficient supply);  Section 43 (neglect     to provide and maintain fire  plugs  or occasional failure of     supply of water); and Section 45 (neglect to  lay communi-     cation pipes to small houses) of the Act of 1847.  There-     is usually also a continuing forfeit,  but here again the     sections  contain  no  express  savings  for  recovery  of;     damages.       (c) Penalties recoverable  summarily by  virtue  of Sec-     tion 85  of the  Act  of 1847.   In the Act of 1863,  among     other examples are  Sections 17  (waste due to non-repair     of  pipes, etc.),  and  18 (application  of water  contrary-     to   agreement).   In  certain cases the  undertakers  are     empowered  also to institute proceedings  for the  recovery     of the value of the water wasted or mis-used.       (d) Penalties  under  Special  Acts,  in  which it  is the-     modern practice to  provide that proceedings may be taken     in  courts of summary jurisdiction  and, in some instances,     that proceedings may also  be  instituted  by  the  under-     takers or by persons aggrieved for the  recovery of damages,     or loss incurred.
   Provisions of the type we have described in (a) and (6) arenow obsolete, and we have recommended that the opportunity should  be taken of  bringing the sections which  have  beenreproduced or amended, and new clauses based on Special Actprovisions, into line with the general trend of modern legisla-tion, so as,to provide that breaches of the law shall be punish-able by fines, and that persons who have sustained damage may seek redress in the civil courts.                   Security of Reservoirs.   37. Sections  3 to 10 of  the Act of  1863  provide that  twojustices, on complaint from any interested person  or on theirown initiative,  may  make enquiry into the security  of  anyreservoir constructed  by the undertakers.  If  they are satisfiedthat there is imminent danger, they may order any person theythink fit to lower the water and carry out any remedial measures required; if the  reservoir is unsafe, but danger is not imminent,they may, after the undertakers have been heard,  order themto do the works required  in the interests of  safety.   There  ispower also for the recovery of the  costs incurred  from theundertakers, who  can  appeal to, quarter sessions  if they areaggrieved by any order made.  The undertakers are relieved ofany liability for claims for breaches  of conditions to supplyoccasioned by any  orders  made.  In view of the Act of 1930(see paragraph  13  of the  Report), these provisions no longerapply to large reservoirs.   The procedure is obsolete in many respects, and it is doubtful,whether,  in  view  of  the  great  improvements  in  engineeringpractice in relation to waterworks since 1863, the  powers arerequired any longer.  The whole question of safety of reservoirswas reviewed before the Act of 1930 was introduced. Moreover,we have been unable to find a recorded case of the powers con-ferred  by Sections  3  to 10 of  the Act of 1863 having been exercised.  In  all the circumstances,  the conclusion  has beenreached that  the powers should not be continued.                        PART  III.   PROCEDURE FOR BRINGING A NEW WATERWORKS CODE INTO                        OPERATION.   38. In the  Second Schedule we have indicated the provisionsof &quot;the First Schedule that we recommend should be incorporatedwith the Act  of  1936 to replace corresponding provisions of theActs of 1847 and 1863 now incorporated with that Act.   It is not expected that any serious difficulties would arise if the necessary amendments  were effected forthwith, as the only provisions inthe substituted clauses likely to transfer expense from the con-sumers  to the local authorities would  be those  relating  to the repair of communication pipes, which will not, in our view, be
a serious  liability.   The Act of  1936,  moreover, gives localauthorities a free hand to adjust water rates and charges if thisshould be found to be necessary, or  enables local  authoritiesto apply to the  Minister for a revision of charges for meteredsupplies in cases in which he has fixed  maximum charges underthe powers of Section 127 of that Act.   We have recommended,therefore, that the clauses  should be incorporated  forthwithwith the Act of 1936 (Clause 20).  39. The question of Special Act undertakings presents more serious difficulties.   To provide that the new provisions should come into operation and supersede at once the provisions of theSpecial Acts might put some undertakers in an unfair position.The  recommendations,  for example,  as/to ithe  inclusion of charges for baths and water-closets in the domestic charge, andthe adoption of a uniform basis of net annual value for the waterrate  might transfer financial liabilities from the consumer to theundertakers, with consequent loss  of revenue to the  latter.  Atthe same time, many of the Special Acts would prohibit revisionof rates or charges without the approval of Parliament, and aBill  or Provisional Order an expensive matter for the smallerundertakings would be required if increases proved necessary.We  estimate that more than 450 water undertakings would beaffected.  The existing system of requiring undertakers to obtainnew  powers by local Act or Provisional Order would thus be a heavy strain on the time of Parliament, apart from the consider-able expenditure which  the undertakers would have to incur;on the other hand, to wait until a new Code is incorporated inthe ordinary course of local legislation would defeat one of the primary objects  of the proposed Bill, namely, that there shouldbe as great a degree of uniformity as possible in the law govern-ing public water supply. In view of these considerations, werecommend that water undertakers should be given a reasonableopportunity of  reviewing  the  circumstances of  their under-takings, and that the Minister should then be empowered to put the new Code into  operation by Order, on the application of theundertakers, who  should be  given an opportunity  of  revisingtheir rates and charges before the Order comes into  operation.  It has been represented to the  Committee that the abolitionof additional charges for water closets and baths would impose a very heavy  burden on the water undertakers in some areas,and  that it might be impracticable to revise water rates in those areas without increasing the rates of small houses, many of whichwould not benefit  by  the remission of the  additional charges.We  have accordingly  provided that  the Minister should haveregard to these  considerations before making an Order putting the new Code into  force (Clause 19 (4) ).  Clause  19 (1) provides for the incorporation of the new Codewith Special Acts.   It is anticipated that the water undertakers
                                                        \                            36                          Dwill be required, as now, to show cause if they desire to exceptany  provisions from incorporation  with the Special Act, or tomodify sections.  We anticipate that notice of the intention to apply to  theMinister for an Order incorporating the Code would be givenin one or more newspapers circulating in the  areas  affected,with an intimation of the parts of the Code to be incorporated,that notice would also be given to local authorities of areas withinthe limits of supply and that representations by interested personscould be made to the Minister.   Provision is made for this in clause 19 (3), which also provides for notice to be published inthe London Gazette.   We do not  expect  that there would  beneed for a local inquiry into the majority of applications, unless there is also an application for revision  of rates and charges, asthe Code would have been approved by Parliament as generallysuited to the requirements of water undertakings  and consumers.A general power is provided, however,  for the Minister to holdinquiries into  these  and  other matters  if  the  need  arises(Clause 17).  40. It has  already been  stressed  that the undertakers shouldhave a reasonable opportunity of reviewing the circumstances ofthe undertaking before the new  Code is adopted.  We considerthat  a period of five years should be sufficient for every under-taker to carry out this survey.  We have provided, therefore,that  if by the end of  that period the new Code has not beenput in force in any area, the Minister should be empowered byOrder to incorporate it with the relevant Special Acts on his own initiative (Clause 19 (2) ).               Revision of Rates and Charges.  41. The existing procedure for revision of charges varies verymuch from area to area.  Under Sections 80 to 82 of the Act of1847, a Court of Quarter Sessions,  on the  petition of two waterratepayers within  the  limits of  supply, may  direct an  inquiry into  the financial position of the water undertaking and, if theyare satisfied that the profits for the preceding year have exceeded the prescribed rate, that the maximum authorised amount of theReserve Fund is  invested, and the full  authorised dividendshave been paid, may order the undertakers to make such reduc-tion  in the water rates  as they think proper,  provided  that the reduced rate is sufficient to ensure a profit as near as possibleto that  authorised by the Act.   These  provisions are rarely, ifever, used and we have suggested that  they should be repealed.There  are  general  powers for local  Act undertakers,  whetherlocal authorities or companies,  to  obtain revision  of rates  and charges by Provisional Order  procedure, and reference  hasalready been made to the power for revising  charges under theAct  of 1921  (see paragraph 12).   It is common practice  also
for Special Acts to empower  the  Minister  by Order to reviserates and  charges  on the application of the undertakers or oflocal authorities of areas  in the  limits of  supply in someexamples,  an  application may also be  made by twenty  con-sumers.  Another  type of  common form  provision empowersthe Minister to make  Orders revising rates if  the  circumstancesof the undertaking have altered by reason  of the quinquennialrevaluations of property under the Rating  and Valuation Act,1925.  Some Special  Acts  provide that the revised rates and charges  in the case of  companies shall  be sufficient to  enablethe  undertakers to continue  to pay dividends at the ratesauthorised, after allowance  has been made for the running andoverhead  expenses of the  undertaking,  and  the contributions which the  undertakers are  authorised to carry to their reserve and contingency funds; in the majority of cases, it is usual alsoto provide that there shall  be no further revision of rates and charges for a prescribed period usually  five years.  42. It is clearly desirable  that there should  be a  uniformprocedure  for the revision of charges :  it is essential also, in viewof the many applications which may be  expected for  Ordersincorporating the new Code, that the undertakers should not berequired to incur the expense and  delay of procedure by Pro-visional  Order.  We  recommend  that power, now  commonlyincluded in Special Acts, for the  Minister  to revise rates and charges  by Order  on the  application of  the undertakers,  aninterested  local authority  or twenty consumers should be madegeneral (Clause 8).APPENDIX.                     NOTES  ON CLAUSES.                 CLAUSES OF THE PROPOSED BILL.  Clause 1. The clause will  re-enact and amend the  Acts of 1870 and1873, which do not appty to local authorities.  Sub-clause (1)  enables the Minister to make Orders,  on the applicationof any persons,  except local  authorities, authorising them  to construct,alter or continue and maintain waterworks; to form and carry on  water undertakings; to  furnish joint supplies or amalgamate their  undertakings;to vary limits of supply; and to purchase or  sell an undertaking or partof an undertaking.  In accordance with the recommendation of paragraph 10 of  the Report,it is provided that the powers shall not extend to the compulsory acquisi-tion of land or water rights;  that the acquisition, amalgamation andalteration of  undertakings,  and the furnishing of joint supplies shall besubject to the approval of the  proprietors of the affected undertakings(Sub-clause (1));  and that Orders shall be provisional only where there isopposition which is not withdrawn (Sub-clause (6)).
  Apart from the  substitution of Orders  for Provisional Orders  in  caseswhere there is  no opposition,  or opposition is  withdrawn,  the principalamendments proposed are  in Sub-clauses  (3) to  (5).  Under Section 5 ofthe Act of 1870,  the promoters  of  a Provisional Order must  give noticeby  the 1st November to every company,  corporation or person supplyingwater within the district to which the proposed application refers; in Octoberor November notice  of the application containing details  of  its objects, ageneral description of any new works, the names of the places in which theywill be constructed, the times and places at which documents and plans willbe deposited, and the office where copies of the draft Provisional Order andthe Provisional  Order when made can be  obtained,  must  be  published  for two successive weeks in  a local newspaper  and once  at least in  the LondonGazette; while  in  the same month,  notice  must  be  given,  if water isto be abstracted from a stream, to owners and occupiers of  mills,  etc.,using water from the stream for a distance of twenty  miles below  the pro-posed point of abstraction or, if the  stream joins  a navigable stream at lessdistance,  as far as the  junction.   Before the  end of  November, copiesof the  advertisement and- of any plans  required  by  the Minister  mustbe  deposited at the  Ministry of  Health and with the clerk of  the countycouncil.   By the  23rd  December a memorial praying for a  provisional order, a printed draft of the Provisional Order and  an estimate of the costof any new works  must be deposited with the Minister, and  copies of  thedraft Provisional Order  must be  available  for sale to  interested persons atthe places  indicated in the  original advertisement.   Under Section  8 of  theAct,  the Provisional  Order, when made, has to  be  deposited at the  placenamed  in  the  original advertisement and with  the&apos;  clerk of  the  countycouncil; and the full  Order has to be published once in the local paper inwhich  the  preliminary  advertisement appeared,  not  later  than   the25th  April.  The Act does  not permit of any variation of  this lengthy and expensive procedure;  if any step to be taken  is even one day  out of time awhole year&apos;s delay is entailed.  Under the alternative  procedure  provided  in  Sub-clause  (3)  the  appli-cation for an  Order  has to be advertised  in  the London  Gazette andlocally, adequate notices have to  be  given  to all interested local authoritiesand  the plans and draft Order  have to  be deposited  locally and  to beopen  for inspection free of charge.   Sub-clause (4)  ensures that interestedpersons can  obtain a copy of the draft Order at a reasonable cost;  Sub-clause (5) provides for any modifications of the draft  Order to  be broughtto the  notice of  all persons  concerned.   Protection  is afforded  in  Sub-clause (2)  for  the shareholders  of  companies.   The amended procedurehas the  additional advantage that  application for  necessary  powers canbe submitted at any period of the year.  Sub-clause (7) as to the costs of Orders,  reproduces the third part ofSection 7 of the Act of 1870.  Provision is made  in  Sub-clause  (8)  (which replaces  Section 12 of  theAct  of 1873) for the amendment  of Orders made under the clause  by subsequent Orders  made by the Minister in accordance  with the procedure of the clause.  The sub-clause  extends the proposed power to  ProvisionalOrders made under the  Act of  1870, and to local authorities who  haveexercised the powers of the Act of  1936  of  acquiring water undertakingsgoverned by such Provisional Orders.   In  the latter cases, the  ProvisionalOrders would still  be in force, notwithstanding  that  the  local  authorities were  supplying  under the  Act  of 1936.   Under Section  116  (6) of thatAct,  a local authority in this  position  may  obtain  necessary amendments of the Provisional Order by means of a  further Provisional Order  madeunder Section  303 of the  Public Health  Act,  1875.   It is  provided inthe sub-clause  that  the local authority  should have  the  same  powers as water companies for the amendment of any Provisional Orders regulate-ing the undertaking.
  Sub-clause (9) reproduces the  first  part of Section  13  of the Act of1870.  The following sections of the two Acts have not been reproduced:        Section 4  of the Act  of 1870 requires the undertakers  to obtain    the  consent of the  local  authority if powers are  required  for the    construction of works, and of the  road authority if power is sought    to break up any road, unless the Minister is of opinion, after  inquiry,    that consent should  be dispensed  with, in which  case he  is  required    to make a  special report to Parliament  stating  the  grounds for his    decision.  As the local authority and the  road authority will  be in a    position  to  oppose the Order,  in  which   case it  would  become pro-    visional,  the power is  no  longer required.      Section 9  of the Act of 1870 deals  with  the  confirmation  of Pro-    visional  Orders  by  Parliament; the  procedure   is now  covered  by    Standing Orders and by  Section 285  of the  Act of 1933.  Section 10    of the Act of 1870 recites the  general Acts which are to be incorporated    with  Provisional Orders;  the section  is considered  to be unnecessary    in view of the  suggested powers  of  Sub-clause  (1)  and of  Clause  19 (1)    of the Bill, which  requires  the new  Code  to be  incorporated  with    Orders authorising or regulating the  supply of water.   Section  11 of    that Act imposes time limits for  the commencement and completion of    works; the  period requisite for  this purpose varies according to the    extent of the  work and  other  factors, and  it is  considered  that, in    accordance with the modern practice in relation to the construction of    waterworks,  the  date  for completion  should be prescribed  by the    Order.  Section  12 of  the Act of  1870 empowers the undertakers to    charge the  rents and rates authorised  by the Provisional  Order; the    question is   covered  by  Sub-clause (1).   Section  13 of  the Act of    1873  provides  that the Minister may  appoint commissioners for the    purposes of  holding  inquiries and  the  procedure  to be followed; the    section has  been replaced  by Clause 17  of  the proposed Bill,  which    extends  the Ministers general  powers under the  Act of  1933  for    holding  inquiries.   Section  14  of the Act  of  1873  empowers the    Minister to  make rules for carrying the  Acts into effect; the  power    would no longer  be required under the  amended procedure.  Clause 2 reproduces the Act of 1934, and extends the powers of under-takers to the taking of a  supply of water in bulk from any  person (seeparagraph 14 of the Report).   The  opportunity has  been taken  to  bringthe powers into line with the provisions of Section 116 (2) of the Act of 1936(which  enable  a local authority to  supply  water in their  district withthe consent  of  the authorised water undertakers, or  with  the ministers approval  if such consent  is  unreasonably withheld), by  providing thatconsent to the taking of a  bulk supply  shall not be unreasonably  withheldif the undertakers  to whom a supply is to  be given are a local authority,and the area to be supplied is  within the  limits of  supply  of anotherstatutory water undertaker (Clause  2 (1) (6)).  Sub-clause (2)  applies  theprovisions of Parts V and VI of the First Schedule  of the  proposed Billto mains laid for the purposes of giving or taking bulk supplies.  under clause 24 of that Schedule local  inquiry by the Minister is necessary if  amain is  laid in  a  street outside the limits of supply unless  the countyborough  council,  or  county  district  council,  as  the  case may  be,and the  highway  authority,  if  they  are  a   different  authority  consent;Clause  29 affords  similar  protection for streets,  bridges,  etc., belongingto or under  the control of railway  companies and other statutory  under-takers.   The remainder of Clause 2 reproduces similar provisions  in  theAct of  1934, except that it is provided that  notice shall be given  in  theLondon  Gazette and to any  interested  fishery  board.
&apos;  Clause  3 is new.   The  provisions will facilitate  the supply of waterto areas which by reason  of their distance  from existing  mains could besupplied by the authorised undertakers or responsible local authority  only at prohibitive cost.  The procedure frequently  adopted in Special  Acts tomeet this difficulty has been to empower the  Minister by Order to authorisethe  undertakers of an adjacent district, if they can afford a supply  at  areasonable cost, to take over the responsibility for the area concerned  untilthe  authorised undertakers or the responsible local authority are in a  posi-tion to supply.  This course was  also followed  in Sections 113  and 117 ofthe  Public Health Act of  1936.    Such a procedure  is  clearly in  theinterest of good administration, and we recommend that a  general power should now  be given for  the purpose.  The clause  provides  that if theMinister is satisfied that owners or occupiers outside the limits of supplyof statutory  water undertakers desire those undertakers to  afford a supply,that the giving of a supply is not likely to interfere with the supply to theremainder of the area.&apos;within the limits  of supply and that  the consentof the local authority and  of any undertakers within whose limits the area is situated has been  obtained  (which,  consent shall  not be unreasonablywithheld), he may authorise them to supply the area in question. provision is made also for  the  Special Acts of the supplying undertakers to  applyto the area,  and for the retransfer of the obligation of supplying the area to the authorised undertakers, or responsible local authority,   if they are able to supply  the  premises,  and  reimburse  the supplying   undertakersfor  the expenditure incurred  for  the purpose of supplying the area.   Clause 4 is new (see paragraph  24  of the Report).  In  Sub-clause (3)provision is  made for joint action by  local authorities for the purpose  ofgiving an undertaking  under the clause.   Clause  5.   Sub-clause (1) enables statutory water undertakers to furnishsupplies for non-domestic purposes.   A similar power is usually included  in modern Special Acts.  Although there  are some Special Act precedents for an  obligation to  supply for non-domestic purposes,  the proposed  generalobligation to supply  on reasonable  terms and conditions,  if the ability  tomeet existing or probable future requirements for  domestic purposes without having to incur unreasonable expenditure in constructing  new waterwoks for  the purposes is not thereby endangered,  is  new, as is the provision for determination of  differences by the  Minister  (see  paragraph  26 of the Report).    Sub-clauses (3)  and  (4)  are also new.  The former applies the provisions relating to the laying and maintenance of pipes  for  domestic purposes  (if  they apply  in  the area concerned)  to pipes laid for non- domestic supplies.  (See Clauses  43 to 45 and 47, First Schedule.)  Under the latter, the undertakers, if  they fail to  give or maintain a supply for non-domestic purposes  will be  liable,  in  the absence of agreement to the contrary, to the  penalties for failure  to give or maintain a  supply for domestic purposes.  The general savings  in Section 13 of the  Act of 1863 which, unless there is express agreement to  the contrary, relieve the under- takers from  liability for failure to supply for non-domestic purposes, if such failure is due to frost,  &amp;c, are thus no longer required  and have  not been reproduced.   (See Clause 33 (2) of the First  Schedule which includes similar savings).  The power in Sub-clause (5)  to  recover  charges in  the manner in which water rates may be recovered follows  Special Act provisions.   Clause 6.   The clause provides a general power for payment and recovery of water rates.  Section 68 of the Act of 1847, which is incorporated with the Act of 1936,  and with most Special Acts, provides for the water rate to be  paid  by  and  recoverable from the person requiring, receiving or using the supply  of water.   The clause substitutes the occupier of  the premises supplied, unless the  owner is responsible by express statutory  provision or by  agreement with  the   undertakers.  The powers  for recovery in Sub- clause (3) follow those of Section 74 of the Act of  1847 and Section 21 Of
the Act of 1863, but the language has  been simplified, and it is providedthat water shall not be cut off, in case of non-payment of  the water rate,if there is any dispute as to the amount due, or as to the  liability to paythe rate.  The remainder of the  clause reproduces the Act  of 1887,  which providesthat a water company may not cut off the water if rates are in arrears andthe owner is responsible for payment.  This is extended to all water under-takers; but  it is provided in Sub-clause (4) that the prohibition shall notapply  if the owner is in  occupation of the premises.  The power of theAct  of  1887 to charge an instalment of  the rate  due  on the premises inpriority to all  other charges is omitted (see paragraph 11  of the Report).  Clause 7  is  new.  It is based  upon Section  g8 of  the Public  Health(London)  Act, 1936  (see paragraph n of  the  Report).  Clause 8  is new but is based on  powers frequently allowed  in  special acts (see paragraphs  41 and 42 of the Report).   It is provided that water rates and charges may be reduced or increased by Order of  the Minister onthe application of the undertakers, an interested local authority or twentyconsumers.   Similar procedure is provided in modern Special Acts,  whichsometimes  require that in the case of water companies the Minister shallendeavour  to secure that  the  revised rates  and charges shall be sufficientto ensure, after allowance has been made for all proper expenses and out-goings  and  contributions to  reserve and  contingency  funds,  that theundertakers can continue to  pay dividends upon the paid-up capital at the authorised rates.  The clause follows Special Act precedent in this respect,except that it  was considered that it would be undesirable to require theMinister to ensure in every case  that  the  undertakers were able  to paydividends at the rates  authorised  (which might  be considerably in  excessof the rate now allowed in modern Acts) if  they had not been paying suchrates in the  past.  It is provided, therefore, that the undertakers shall been abled to pay dividends at a rate  not less than  the average of the ratepaid on the class of capital in question during the  preceding five years.  Clause 9 reproduces Section  61 of the Act of 1847, but has been brought&quot;&quot;into conformity with the language used in  modern Acts.   The  committee recommended in paragraph  15 of Part II  of their First Report that thesection should be extended to oil and tar, and  to the pollution of thesubsoil in the vicinity of springs, wells  or adits  used for water  supply.The clause gives effect to this recommendation,  and also extends  the powersto persons paddling or washing in streams, etc.,  belonging to the under-takers.  Section  61 of  the Act of 1847 provides that persons  committingoffences  shall forfeit to the undertakers sums not  exceeding   5 for thefirst offence and  1  per  day for continuing offences.    The  committee recommended  that the first sum should be increased to   20. In viewof the risk  of danger to public health from the  offences  covered  by thesection, we  recommend that the decision should be reconsidered, and thatthe offences should be punishable by fines  not  exceeding  50 for the firstoffence and  5 for continuing offences.  Clause 10 is new, but is based on provisions frequently allowed in special acts.  Complaint is  often made that  water supplies, particularly  wherethey  are derived from underground and there are occupied buildings  onthe catchment areas, may become polluted from sources which  the under-takers cannot control.  The  proposed power  for the  water undertakersto enter into agreements with owners and occupiers  of land for the carry-ing out of works for drainage and other purposes would assist materiallyin removing potential sources of pollution  from the catchment area, andso safeguard the purity of supplies in cases where acquisition of the landis impracticable,  either on account  of  cost or  for other reasons.
  Clause  II  is  new,  but  follows  Special  Act provisions.   There  is  arrincreasing tendency for water undertakers to acquire the gathering grounds of their sources of supply in order to prevent the risk of pollution fromunrestricted use  of the land;  where  circumstances permit,  this  course  isconsidered to be one  of  the  best methods  of protecting  supplies  frompollution.   Sub-clause (2)  enables the undertakers to  carry  out protectiveworks  on  land  thus  acquired.  The Special Acts  usually  provide thatif the highway authority refuses consent to the  carrying of drains,  sewers,etc., across or  along any street or  road,  the question  whether  or notconsent has been unreasonably withheld should be referred to an arbitratorappointed, in default of agreement,  by the President of The institution of Civil Engineers.  The clause provides for the arbitrator to be appointedby  the Minister, if the parties  do not reach agreement.   This follows the precedent  of  the Act of 1934.  Clause 12 is new.   The usual Special  Act powers authorising undertakersto  make  byelaws for the protection of their water  supply provide thatthe byelaws may require owners and other interested persons to constructand maintain drains  and  similar works, and may  make provision  for theprevention of things tending to pollution  of the water.   Compensation is payable where legal rights are curtailed or injuriously affected, or owners and occupiers  have to  incur  expenditure which would not otherwise benecessary.  The  powers of the clause are  based on the usual  Special Actpractice, but we consider that  it is undesirable, in principle,  that  persons should be required by byelaws to  do things which they  are  not requiredto  do by the general law.  We have accordingly made  provision  for thelimits  of  control to  be defined in the  byelaws;  that within  such limits the byelaws  may prohibit the  doing  of  any act  which  may  tend topollute  the water; and that where an  area has been defined, the  under-takers may, under the general powers of the clause, require  owners andoccupiers  to carry out necessary  drainage,  etc., works in that area.  Theusual requirements  as to  compensation are contained in  Sub-clause  (3)which  contains a special definition of &quot; legal rights &quot; following the defini-tion usually adopted  in Special Acts.  Sub-clause (4) provides that byelawsshall be confirmed by the Minister, and extends the  provisions of the act of I933 to water undertakers who are not local authorities.  It is desirablethat proposals for byelaws  of this  character should  receive full  publicity.Provision is made, therefore, in Sub-clause (5) for the undertakers  to send a copy of the byelaws to  every interested local authority,  to  exhibit  a notice in  affected local government areas,  to publish  notice of their inten-tion to apply for confirmation  in the London Gazette, and,  where ownersor occupiers require, to furnish them free of charge with a copy of the bye-laws and  a statement of the effect of the clause.  We have also modifiedSection 250 of the Act of 1933 by providing that persons interested mayobtain a  copy of the  draft byelaws for the sum  of one shilling  insteadof  a price, not exceeding  sixpence  for  one hundred  words.  In view of the wide powers of the clause, we  have modified  the usualSpecial Act procedure by providing that there shall  be an  appeal to  theMinister if an owner  or occupier considers the undertakers&apos; requirements tobe  unreasonable.   (Proviso  to  Sub-clause  (2), which is new.) .  Clause  13 is  new,  but is based  on  provisions  commonly  included  in special Acts.   The power to discharge water into  rivers  and watercoursesmay be essential when reservoirs  or other works are being  constructed,repaired or cleaned,  or if they have  to be emptied in case of emergency,and it is proposed that it  should  be made of  general application.  Sub-clause (2) provides that  except  in an  emergency,  the  undertakers shall give direct notice to interested catchment boards, fishery  boards and navi-gation authorities, and public notice by advertisement in a local newspaper
before  the  powers of the  clause  are  exercised, the  intention  being thatthe  responsible authorities and riparian owners shall be in a  position tomake  preparations if. large quantities of water are to be  discharged,  andthat the undertakers shall also give due regard to any representations madeas to the time and mode of discharge, so as to obviate,  as far as possible,the  risk of  damage.  These requirements are new.  Paragraph  (c) of Sub-clause (2) and the proviso are based on Special Act provisions.  It is clearlyreasonable that an inland navigation authority should  not only have notice,but  should also have control of the discharge of water into an artificialnavigation  so that damage to  banks or locks, or  interference with  trafficmay be obviated.  In Sub-clause (3), which, is new, penalties are providedfor  failure  on the part  of  the undertakers  to take  reasonable steps toensure  that the water is free from  substances liable to cause  damage toriparian owners  or injury to fish  or  fisheries.  Failure to  take these pre-cautions may render the river  water temporarily unfit for valuable  indus-trial processes and for waterworks purposes, or may  cause  serious  injury to fisheries; it is considered  reasonable  that the undertakers should take all  practicable  steps to  avoid such  damage, and  should be  liable  to  a penalty if they fail to do so.  In view of the large amount of the maximumpenalty, it is  provided for proceedings to  be taken  by indictment,  butthat they may be taken in a court of  summary jurisdiction if the exactionof a smaller penalty is sought.   Sub-clause  (4) embodies  savings,  basedon Special Acts, for  railways, docks,  inland navigations  and canals.   Sub-clause  (5), which also follows Special  Acts provides for payment of com-pensation for any  damage caused.  It is  considered  that the  undertakershould  be  subject  to liability  for payment  of compensation for  damage caused, though  he  has acted  in  accordance with  the  statutory require-ments,  and that he should not be relieved of the  liability because, by having contravened  these requirements, he is liable  to a  fine.  Clause  14 is  new, but  is  based  on  Special  Act provisions.   water undertakers  frequently  obtain  special  powers  to   provide   offices  fortheir undertakings and houses  for their employees; in some instances thepowers have been  extended to the provision  of recreation grounds.  Theclause  gives general powers for the purposes, with power for the undertakersto acquire land by agreement for any of  the purposes stated.  Clause 15 is  new,  but is  based on  Special Act  provisions.   The  clausewould  enable water companies  to issue and redeem redeemable  stock,  andwhen stock  is to be redeemed, to exceed temporarily the authorised amountof stock during the necessary interval between the  creation or issue  of newstock and the redemption of the old stock. Stock includes preference sharesand  preference  and  debenture stock.    We  recommend that the  powers should  be  applied generally to water companies.  Under Section 113 of the Stamp  Act,  189/1, stamp duty  is payable onthe nominal capital  of the water company; if the nominal capital has beenfully issued, the temporary excess allowed under the  clause  would involve further liability to this duty.  Paragraph 8  of the First Schedule of the gas  Undertakings Act,  1934,  relieves  gas companies  of. this liability  and section 46 (4) of the  Companies Act, 1929, gives the same relief for limitedcompanies;  we  have suggested that  similar  relief should  be extended to water  companies.  Clause 16 is  new.  It follows Section 298 of the Act of  1936.  Clause 17 is new.   It empowers the  Minister to hold any inquiries neces-sary in the discharge of any of his functions with respect to water under-takings, and extends the provisions of Section 290 of the Act  of 1933 toundertakers who are not local  authorities.
        CLAUSES  IN  THE FIRST SCHEDULE TO  THE PROPOSED  BILL.                       Part II Works and  lands.  Clause 2 reproduces Section 8 of the Act of 1847, but provision is madefor deposit of amended plans and sections with the officials with whom theoriginals were required to be deposited by Standing Orders, instead of withthe clerk of  the  county council.   The requirement that extracts shall be deposited with parish clerks  is omitted, as being no  longer  required.  Clause 3 replaces Section 11 of  the Act of 1847,  which has now been largely  superseded by  provisions in Special Acts similar to those of theclause.  Clause 4 is new.  It is  now the usual  practice (following  the House  ofLords&apos; Model Water Bill)  for Special Acts to prohibit the construction  ofnew works for taking  or  intercepting water  from lands belonging to theundertakers,  unless  such works are expressly authorised;  local  authorities who supply  water under the Act  of 1936  must obtain the consent  of theMinister to the use  of new sources. It is considered  that  the Special Actrequirement  should  be incorporated with  the new Code,  and that water undertakers  should thus  be  required  in  every  case  to  obtain expressapproval of  the  acquisition of  fresh sources of supply.  Clause 5 replaces  Section 12  of the Act  of  1847, but has been redraftedto conform with  the language of modern Acts.  In view of the prohibitionof Clause 4,  the power in Section 12 to construct wells and shafts has been omitted.  The clause is based  on  Special Act provisions.  Clause 6. It may be necessary in the case  of large  undertakings to pro-vide telephonic or similar communication between the undertakers  offices and works,  and  powers  for  this  purpose are now commonly  allowed  in special Acts.  The  clause  follows  Special Acts provisions.  Clause 7 reproduces Section  13 of the Act of 1847.  Clause 8 is new.  It is the common practice in Special Acts authorising the  construction  of underground   works  to  empower the undertakers  toacquire easements in lieu of acquiring the  lands scheduled in the Acts.  Theclause follows Special  Acts provisions.   Clauses 9,  10  and 11 are  new.   Similar powers are  commonly allowed in Special Acts.   It is desirable that they should be  included in the Codeinstead of being  expressly re-enacted in each  individual case.   Clause 12  is new.  It is now common practice  for  Special  Acts to allowundertakers  to acquire additional lands by agreement.  A limit of quantityis usually prescribed,  with a provision that it shall be exceeded only withthe consent  of the Minister.  The clause follows Special Act  provisions.  Clause 19 provides for the incorporation of the provisions contained inthe First Schedule with future  Special Acts, and for their incorporationwith existing Special Acts by Order of the Minister on the application ofwater undertakers or, at the expiration of five years, on his own initiative.The Minister is empowered, also, to repeal or amend any existing provisions in Special Acts  affected by his Orders which are rendered unnecessary bythe provisions applied,  or are inconsistent with them.   (See paragraphs 39and 40 of the Report.)  Clause 21 provides for the general repeal of provisions in  Special Acts orOrders  which  are inconsistent with the provisions of  the First Schedule,when the latter come  into  force.  Clause 22. The Acts  of 1847 and 1863 extended to  England and Wales,Scotland and Ireland; the Acts of  1870 and 1873 to those countries, except the Metropolis;  the -Acts of  1887,  1921 and 1934 to  England and  Walesonly.   It is proposed that the Bill  shall extend to England and Wales only.
  - Clause 13 is new.  It affords undertakers a greater  margin of discretion in retaining or disposing of lands acquired under Special Act powers than is permitted by the  Lands  Clauses  Acts.   Similar powers are commonlyallowed in Special Acts.  It is  recommended that the powers  should  beincluded in  the  Code, instead  of  being  expressly  re-enacted in  each individual  case.                     Part III Compensation water. . Clause 14 (see paragraphs 18 to 20 of the Report).               Part  IV Minerals underlying waterworks. - Clauses 15 to 22.  These clauses, with drafting alterations to  bring them into  conformity  with  the  language   used in  modern  Acts,  reproduceSections 18 to 27  of the Act of 1847, which regulate the position of under-takers in relation  to  mining interests.   It is provided  in Clause 16 (1) thatthe scale of the maps required to be prepared by the undertakers shall benot  less than  six inches to the  mile instead of one  foot, as required  bySection 19 of  the  Act of 1847; and in Clause 16  (2) that copies of the mapsshall be deposited with the interested local authorities, instead  of with theclerks of county  councils, as provided  by Section 20 of the Act  of  1847.The requirement  of the same section that maps should be deposited withparish clerks is considered to be.no longer necessary, and has been  omitted.                  Part V Power  to  lay  mains,  etc.   Clause 23 is new but follows  the  Act of 1936.  It  empowers the under-takers to  lay mains in any  street  and in, on, or over any land, and  to repair, alter or remove them.   The requirements that  mains shall not  be laid in any land not  forming part  of  a street unless the  consent of  the owner  and occupier  is obtained, and that any question whether such consent has  been  unreasonably withheld  shall be  determined by  theMinister, are new.   (See paragraph 22  of  the  Report.)   The provision in Sub-clause (2) that  notice shall be given  to the land drainage authority follows  the  similar provision of Section  15  of the   Act of 1936.   Sub- clause (3)  provides for payment of compensation to owners of private land who sustain damage or injurious affection  from the  exercise of the  under- takers&apos; powers.   We  have followed  the procedure of  the Act of 1936 that compensation shall be assessed by  an arbitrator appointed, in default of agreement, by the  Minister,  but,  as  indicated  in   paragraph 22 of  the Report, have not adopted  the provisions of Section 278 (4)  of  that  Act relating to betterment.   Clause 24  is new but follows the Act  of  1936.  It  provides for public advertisement of proposals  to lay mains outside  the  limits of  supply,  and for  notice to be  served on  the interested local authority; and, if there is objection  by an affected local authority or owner or  occupier of land, that the undertakers shall not proceed until all objections  have been withdrawn or the Minister,  after local inquiry, has approved the  proposals.  In Sub- clause (3) it  is provided that the requirements of the  clause as to notices and as to objections  to the  Minister  shall not apply if a main is  to be laid in a highway maintainable  at the public expense and the undertakers have obtained the consent of the  local authority and  highway  authority of the area concerned.  The  clause follows Section 16 of the Act of 1936, except that the  consent of the  highway authority, as well as that of  the local authority, is required.  It is considered reasonable that  the highway authority should have the opportunity of objecting to  a  proposal to  lay mains outside the undertakers&apos;  limits  of  supply.   Clause  25  is new.   The clause   enables the undertakers  to lay  service  pipes and other works in  any  street  within the limits  of supply for  the
purpose of connecting individual premises with service mains, and to main-tain any pipes lawfully laid in private land if  the  need should arise.  Inview of the definition of &quot; street &quot; in Clause i of the First  Schedule, thepowers will extend to  private streets,  as , well as  to highways,  whethermaintainable at the public expense or not.                   Part VI Breaking open streets,  etc.  Clause 26 reproduces  Section 28 of the Act of  1847, which applies onlyto the breaking up of streets within limits of supply.  It is often necessaryto break up streets for the purpose  of  laying  mains between  the sources of supply and the  limits of supply, and  the clause gives this power.  Clauses 27  and  28  reproduce Sections 30  and 31  of  the  Act  of  1847.There are  some  minor  drafting alterations to bring the clauses into  con-formity with the language used in modern-  Acts.  In particular the lengthof notice to the  highway authority is increased from three to seven cleardays.  This extension is common in Special Acts.  Clause 29 is new.   It extends similar savings of  Sections  279 to 281  ofthe  Act of  1936.  Clause 30 reproduces Section 32  of  the Act, 1847,  but  has been re-drafted to bring it  into  conformity with  the language used in modern  Acts.  Clause 31  reproduces Sections 33  and 34 of the Act of 1847,  but hasbeen redrafted.  A penalty of  5  for the first offence,  with a continuingpenalty of   5,  has been substituted for the forfeits of similar  sums  inSection 33 of the  Act  of 1847 (see  paragraph  36 of Report).  It is also made clear  that the penalties do not interfere  with the undertakers&apos;  civilliability,  if.any, to. a person suffering injury by reason of their default.           Part  VII Supply  of water  for domestic purposes.  Clause 32 reproduces  the similar obligations of Section 35  of the Act of1847, for the  undertakers to lay necessary  mains and bring water to any area in the limits  of supply, if the aggregate amount of water rates pay-able is not less than the prescribed return on  their capital outlay on laying the  mains, and the consumers severally agree  to take a supply for  threeyears at least.   In  accordance with modern  practice,  a return of  one-eighth of  the capital outlay has been  substituted  for the  return  of one-tenth prescribed  by Section  35.  The clause is  also extended to the laying of mains for the purpose of affording  a domestic supply to any premises.  Under Section 36 of the Act of 1847 provision is made that if the under-takers fail within  twenty-eight  days of the  receipt of  such a requisitionto lay mains and provide a supply, they shall forfeit to each consumer theamount of the rate for  which he is liable and a sum of forty  shillings forevery day the supply is not provided, with a proviso that they  shall not be liable if  the want  of  supply is  due to frost, unusual  drought or  otherunavoidable cause  or accident.   It is  considered that the period of twenty-eight days does  not allow the undertakers sufficient time  in  every case,and we have accordingly extended it  to  three months.  We have increased the  maximum  fine to ^50 in view of the fact that the clause  relieves  theundertakers from the liability to pay a forfeit  to every aggrieved consumer.  Clause 33.  Sub-clause  (1) gives the  consumer the right  to demand  a supply for  domestic purposes to any  premises if he has  complied with theprovisions of Part X of the Schedule.  Sub-clause (2) provides  a fine of  5for the first offence and a continuing penalty of  2 if the undertakers fail to maintain the supply, but it is considered that the  imposition of a smallfine  should not relieve the undertakers from civil liability  for damage causedby their default, and provision has accordingly been made that the liability to the fines shall be without  prejudice  to  the  undertakers&apos;  civil  Uability,if any, to the person aggrieved.  The  proviso  reproduces the similar proviso
of Section  36 of the  Act of 1847, with the addition that the undertakers.shall not be  responsible if the failure to give  or maintain a supply is dueto the non-compliance  of the  consumer with  their byelaws.  It is  clearly desirable   that  the  undertakers should  not  be  responsible  in  such circumstances.  Clause 34 reproduces  the  first part of Section 35  of the Act of 1847.             Part VIII Supply of water  for public purposes.  Clause 35.  Section 38 of the Act of 1847  as amended by Section 2 ofthe Act of  1938,  requires  the undertakers,   at the  request of the fireauthority,  to  provide  .,fire  plugs  at  convenient distances not  less  thanthose prescribed  in the Special Act, or if distances are not prescribed, notmore  than 100 yards  from each other; and for disputes to be  settled by an inspector appointed for superintending works connected with paving, drain-age, or water supply  of the area,  or if no inspector has been appointed, by two justices.  Section 2 of the Act of 1938 provides that the  Minister mayby Order modify the provisions of Section  38 of the Act of  1847 in their application to  any rural district, so as to  extend the distances  at whichfire-hydrants are required to be placed.  The  procedure of the Act  of 1847is now  obsolete; and we recommend that in  accordance  with the Act  of1938  the  Minister should  be  responsible in  all  areas  for  deciding any differences which may arise  between  the fire authority and the undertakersas to  the distances at which  fire-hydrants should be placed.  The clause alsocontinues the obligation of  the water undertakers to maintain fire-hydrants(see Section 39 of the Act of 1847).  The cost  of providing and maintainingfire-hydrants is recoverable  from  the fire authority under Clause 37.   Clause 36 reproduces the remainder of Section 39 of the Act of  1847, but has been redrafted to conform  with the Act of 1938, the fire authority beingsubstituted for the town commissioners.   Clause 37 reproduces Section 40 of the Act of 1847, but the fire authority has been substituted for the  town commissioners. It  is also made clearthat  the  undertakers  may  recover  the cost   of affixing  and maintainingnotices  from the  fire authority.   Clatise 38  reproduces Section 41 of the Act of 1847.   Clause 39.   The obligation on  the undertakers in this clause to  providewater for  extinguishing fires without payment reproduces the requirementimposed by Section 42  of the Act of 1847, which also requires them to keep their mains charged with a supply of water under pressure for the purpose,unless prevented by frost, unusual drought or unavoidable cause or accident,or during  necessary  repairs.  The latter requirement  has been merged in clause 42, with the  similar obligation of Section 35  of the Act of 1847 inregard to  supplies for  domestic purposes.   Clause  40 reproduces the obligation  to supply water at agreed ratesfor public purposes  (or at  rates  to  be settled by two justices  if  there isdisagreement)  imposed by Section 37 of the Act of 1847.  We have recom-mended, however, that in conformity with the procedure of Clause  5 of theBill,  disputes  should be determined in future by the Minister.   Clause  41.  Section  43 of the Act of  1847,  as amended by Section 2 ofthe Act of 1938, provides for a penalty of  zo and  a continuing forfeit of  2.payable to  the  fire  authority,  the  town  commissioners  or to  personsaggrieved  if the  undertakers  neglect or refuse except when prevented  byfrost, drought,  unavoidable cause or  accident or repairs:         (a) to provide  and maintain public fire plugs, or to provide a sufficient     supply under pressure for public purposes;       (8)  to supply  under pressure  where fire plugs are provided;       (c)  to supply  any owner or occupier entitled to  a supply during any     part of the time  rates have been paid  or tendered.
   Fines for failure  to provide  and maintain  fire-hydrants  or  to  furnish a sufficient supply for public purposes are contained in this clause,  but we have recommended that as the undertakers will be relieved of the liability to pay a forfeit to every person  aggrieved the maximum fines should be increased to  50, and  5 per day for a continuing offence.   A fine for failure to afford a constant supply under pressure is included in Clause  42 (2).   Fines for neglect to supply for domestic  purposes are included in Clause.33 (2).              Part IX Constancy  and pressure  of supply.   Clause 42 reproduces the obligation imposed by Sections 35  and 42 of the Act of  1847 for the undertakers  to supply under constant pressure for domestic and public purposes, but the proviso is new.   A  supply under constant pressure  to  houses built  on land above  the level of the service reservoir may entail considerable  expenditure for  pumping, and  it is  now common for Special Acts to provide that water need not at any time be delivered at a greater height than can be reached  by gravitation from the service  reservoir from which the  supply is taken, and to leave it to the undertakers to determine the reservoir or tank from which supplies to par- ticular zones are to be taken.  It  is considered reasonable that this proviso should be attached in future to the requirement to supply under pressure. Part X Laying and maintenance  of supply pipes and  communication pipes.   Clause 43 is new. In view of the  amended procedure for the laying and maintenance of service pipes (see  paragraphs 27 to 29 of the Report)  it is necessary to define the requirements, with which the consumer must comply before he can demand a supply for domestic purposes.  The clause provides that he shall give  fourteen days&apos;  notice in writing of bis  intention to lay his supply pipe, pay or tender the water rate, lay the part of the pipe on private land, at his own  expense,  having first obtained any necessary con- sent from  owners or occupiers of intervening land, and  comply  with the undertakers&apos; byelaws (or if there are no byelaws  with their requirements) as to  the bore, strength and material of the&apos; pipe, any dispute  as to require- ments being determined by a court of summary jurisdiction.   Supply pipe is defined in Clause 1 of the First Schedule.   Clause 44 is new.  The  undertakers are required to lay the communica- tion pipe and any part of the supply pipe  which may be  in a highway (they may, if they elect, lay a branch main in lieu  of the part of the supply pipe in a highway, but in that case must not charge the consumer  more than  the expense of  a supply pipe) and to  connect  the supply  pipe  withs the communication pipe within fourteen days  after  the consumer has carried out his obligations under Clause 43, the reasonable expenses incurred being recoverable from the consumer.   They are made liable for a  fine of  5 for : default, and a  fine of  2. for each day on which default continues.   Com- munication pipe is defined in Clause 1 of the First Schedule.    Clause 45 is new.  It is intended to facilitate  the supply of  water to houses inside the limits of supply  which abut on or are near streets which form  the boundary of those limits, by extending the powers  of the under- takers for breaking up streets to those streets, although they  may as to the -whole or part of  their  width  be  outside the limits  of  supply.  In the absence of such a power, the undertakers  would  have  no right to lay pipes in the street for supplying  the houses  or to break up  the street for the purpose.  The clause is based on provisions now frequently allowed in Special Acts.    Clause 46 is new.  The supply of several houses by a common service pipe  often leads to difficulties in regard to  pressure if the  pipe  becomes defective,  or the recovery of rates if the rates  due from the  owners or
occupiers of  any of the houses are in arrears.  To  meet these difficulties,a power for the undertakers to require separate service pipes where two ormore houses are supplied by the same service pipe is now frequently allowed in Special Acts.  It is  considered that a general requirement to this effect would be onerous  if  a satisfactory supply is  being afforded  to existing houses by a common pipe and rates are not in arrears.  Under the clause,the  requirement will  not apply to  existing buildings,  unless  an existingsupply pipe becomes defective, or water rates are not paid, or a house isto be divided into two or more tenements  (Sub-clause (6)).  Sub-clause (7)is intended to meet the case of buildings  divided into  several tenements,e.g.,  blocks  of  flats;  it would be clearly  undesirable  to  require separateservice pipes in such cases if the owner  is willing to pay  the  water; rates.In Sub-clauses (2) to (5) provision has been made for the laying of a separatesupply pipe by  the consumer (or by the  undertakers at his expense if partof the pipe is in a highway) and of a separate communication pipe by theundertakers in the cases where it is found necessary to enforce the require-ments.   Power  is given also for the undertakers to execute the work oflaying the supply pipe, if the owner neglects  to do  so,  and to  recover thecost from him,  while  on the other hand the  undertakers are  made liableto a  fine of   5 and , a continuing  fine of  2  if they fail  to lay the  com-munication pipe or any part of the supply pipe which may  be in a highway.  Clause  47 is new.  Under the procedure recommended  in paragraph 28of the Report the undertakers will  be responsible in future for the repair ofcommunication  pipes.    Sub-clause (1) vests  communication pipes in theundertakers and imposes on them the liability for repair, renewal, etc.  Sub-clause (2) requires the  undertakers to carry out similar work in respect of so much  of any supply pipe  as  is laid in a highway, but empowers themto recover the cost from the owner of the property supplied.  Sub-clause (3)imposes a penalty of  $ with a continuing penalty of  2 for failure to carryout necessary work  of  repair, etc.                          Part XI Stopcocks.  Clause 48 is new.  See paragraph  29 of Report.                 s                   Part XII Water rates and charges.  Clause 49 is new.   Sub-clause (1) gives express power for the undertakersto charge a water rate, and where  no minimum annual charge is prescribed in the Special Act, to charge a minimum sum of one pound per annum.The rate  will be chargeable on the net annual value  of the premises  sup-plied, or, where the premises are used solely for business, trade, or manu-facturing purposes, on such  fraction of the net annual  value  as may beagreed,  or, in default of agreement,  may  be determined by  a court of summary jurisdiction  (see paragraph 31 of the Report).   The net annual value is to be taken, from the valuation list in force at the beginning of the rating period, or, if that value is not stated in the valuation list,  is tobe  determined,  in  default of agreement,  by  a court of summary  juris-diction  (Sub-clause  2).  This follows Section 126 of  the  Act of 1936.  Sub-clause (3) makes provision for the rating of two or more propertiesin  one  occupation  connected by an internal  means of communication.Under the existing  Code,  an occupier  paying  the  water  rate on oneproperty  only  could supply  water  from  that property  to  persons livingor  working in the  other buildings,  notwithstanding that no  water  rate was being paid  in  respect of those  buildings.   A provision  that buildingswithin the  same curtilage and in the same occupation  shall be regardedas one for the purpose of water rates is now  common in Special Acts, whichusually  make it  obligatory for the  undertakers  to  treat the various  pro-perties as one building.   The latter requirement may hinder supplies beingafforded  to houses where  they are urgently required,  e.g., to  cottages
within the curtilage  of a factory  deriving its supplies for trade purposesfrom a private source which is  unfit  for  domestic purposes.  We have recommended, therefore,  that persons  aggrieved  should have the rightof appeal to a court  of summary jurisdiction.  Clatise  50  is new.   It follows  provisions  commonly allowed in  special acts.  Clause  51 is new.   The  clause follows  Special  Acts, provisions.  Theundertakers  are  enabled  to  make charges  not exceeding  the prescribed.maxima for water used for the watering of gardens  or cleansing of vehiclesor  horses if  hosepipes  or taps outside  the house are  used,  instead  of supplying by  meter for the  purposes.   The definition of  &quot;a supply  ofwater for domestic purposes &quot; in  Clause  1 of this Schedule would  excludethese purposes in future from  the scope  of the domestic  rate,  as  iscustomary now in Special Acts.  Clause  52 is new.   Sub-clauses  (1) to  (3) are based on Section   127 (2)of the Act of 1936 and-provisions commonly included in Special Acts, butthe  provision in paragraph  (d) of Sub-clause (2)  is new.   Where premisesof  the kind  covered by the  clause use large quantities  of  water it isin the interests both of &quot;the  individual consumer and of the general bodyof  consumers that the supplies should be  metered.  The practice  securesa more  equitable  distribution of the  cost of providing  supplies  amongconsumers, and  tends  also  to restrict  the  excess consumption and wastewhich might follow if an unmetered supply  were  given at the  rate  charge-able for  domestic purposes.  Provision  is made  in  Sub-clause (4) for  aminimum charge to  meet cases where stand-by supplies only are required.  Clause 53  is  new.  It  enables the  undertakers to require consumerstaking. a supply for domestic purposes  who  install  apparatus consuminglarge quantities  of water to  take  the additional water required by meter.It would be unfair to the general  body of consumers if the  large additional quantitites of water  required  for  the purposes indicated  were  afforded atthe ordinary domestic rate.   Paragraph (i) of the clause  and  the  provisoas  to small water softeners follow the Act of 1936; similar  provisions havebeen allowed  also in recent  Special Acts.   The  object  of paragraph  (ii)of  the clause is to  ensure that   a fair price  is paid by the  consumer  ifcharges  are not prescribed in the Special Act.   Clause 54 is new.  It is based on provisions commonly allowed in special acts.   Clause 55.  The  supply of water  to temporary structures  for domestic purposes presents considerable difficulties.   It is undesirable to  require the undertakers  to afford supplies on the conditions applicable to permanent buildings to structures  capable  of being removed  without notice, which are  sometimes of a  type that does not afford security  for sums  due.   It is  equally undesirable,  if  reasonable  security is forthcoming,  that the occupants - of  structures which satisfy  the  local  authority&apos;s  requirements should be without a proper supply of water.  The clause follows provisions of  modern  Special  Acts.   Clause 56 reproduces  Section  69  of the Act  of 1847,  but the powers are  extended to buildings other  than houses.   Clause , 57  is new, but is  based on  Special  Act provisions.  It  replaces Sections 72  and 73 of  the  Act  of  1847,  which  make  the owner instead of the occupier  liable  for the water rate if  the rent  of the house  does not exceed  10.  The new prescribed  figure of  13  corresponds  with the similar provisions in  the Eating and Valuation Act,  1925, but provision  is  made that where a higher  figure is in force under that. Act,  that figure &apos;shall be  deemed to be substituted for the figure of  13.&quot; ...
  Clause 58 replaces Section 70 of the Act of 1847, which requires water rates to be paid  in  advance by equal instalments on  the usual QuarterDays.  The clause provides that water  rates  shall be made  annually,alters the dates for payment to correspond with the  more  usual divisions of the financial 3*-ear  in  England  and Wales,  and  follows  Section 130  ofthe Act  of  1936 by giving the  undertakers the option of demanding rateshalf-yearly  in  advance.   The  power, subject to the  safeguard  that noinstalment shall  be recoverable until two  months  of the  half-year have elapsed,  facilitates  the joint collection of  water  rates  and  other  rateswhere the local  authority  is the  water undertaker.&apos;   Sub-clause  (2)  (b]relieves  the  consumer of liability  for the  rate  in  respect  of  any  periodof the half-year for which he is not  in occupation  of the premises.  Clause  59 is new,  but  is based on  Section  131  of the. Act of  1936and Special Act  provisions.  It  ensures that effect is  given, so far  asthe  water rate, is  concerned,  to alterations in  the net annual  values  of properties made  during the rate  period, and that amounts&apos;- due or  paidare adjusted accordingly.  Clause 60 is  new.  It is common for Special  Acts to authorise the under-takers to allow discounts or rebates for prompt payments of water rates.The procedure is desirable, providing  that there is a limit to the amount ofthe discount,  and all  consumers are treated alike, and  we have  suggestedthat it  should be  extended to water charges.   The  limit.of  5  per cent.follows  Special Act precedent.  Clause 61 is new.   In  Clause 6, of  the Bill a  general power  is providedfor the recovery of water rates.   It has  been  customary  in  recent local legislation to provide additional  powers to meet the case  where there is reason to believe that a  consumer intends  to  quit a house and evade  pay-ment of  the  rate due before  the undertakers  can take proceedings forrecovery, and  to provide that in such cases a justice may,. in addition toissuing a summons for non-payment of the  water rate due,  issue a distresswarrant.  The clause follows Special Act provisions.  Clause 62  is new.   It  is  based  on Section 136 of the  Act of 1936 and similar   provisions  commonly  allowed  in Special  Acts.   It is clearly desirable, both in  the interests of  the undertakers  and  of the consumers,that  there should be an established practice for  the settlement of disputesas to the correctness  of meters.  Clause 63  is new,  but similar provisions are  usually allowed in special acts.  It is desirable, both in the  interests  of the undertakers and  of consumers, that there should,be written notice of discontinuance of supply.  Part XIII Provisions  for preventing waste, etc., of  water,  and as to                        meters and other  fittings.  Clause 64 follows Section 132 of the Act of  1936, but wei have provided in  Sub-clause  (2)  that bye-laws in  relation  to the  matters  indicated inparagraph (a)  shall apply only to supplies for  domestic purposes, as weconsider that industrial  users of water should not be  obliged to conform to  bye-laws which might hinder the carrying on of  industry.   This con-sideration does not  apply  to the  waste,  misuse, contamination,  etc., ofwater, and  we have  provided, therefore, that bye-laws in. relation to thepurposes of paragraph (6)  shall apply to  all supplies.   Paragraph  (c) of sub-clause  (8) is  also new. There  are no powers corresponding to thisclause in the Acts of 1847 or 1863,  but the  principle that the use of metersand other fittings should be regulated by bye-laws is  now well established,and powers for the purpose are commonly  allowed  in Special Acts.  Clause 65.   Sub-clause (1) reproduces the  similar powers of Section 54of. the  Act of 1847  which applies only  where the  undertakers  are notrequired  to supply   under pressure.   The powers  are extended  to  all
buildings.  In recent Special  Acts it has been customary,  even thoughthe undertakers  may be obliged to  supply  under  pressure, to  empowerthem to require the  owner of  a new  house erected at a higher level thanfifty feet below the level of the service reservoir from which  the  supply isto be taken  to provide  a cistern with  a capacity  sufficient for a day&apos;supply.   To  afford  a constant supply under pressure to  houses in such circumstances may  entail considerable  expenditure  for pumping,  while,on the  other  hand,  the lack  of adequate storage capacity, if there is  anintermittent  supply,  may cause hardship to consumers in the house.   Itis considered  that similar powers should be included in  the  new  Code.(Sub-clause (i)  (6)).  In Sub-clause (2) the powers of Section 54  of the Act of 1847 for cutting off water if there is  default on the consumers part to provide  a cistern,or to keep it in proper -repair,  are omitted.  ,(See paragraph 35  of Report.)The power in Section 56 of the Act of 1847 for the undertakers  to  repaircisterns and recover the cost from the person responsible is continued, and extended to the  provisiop of the cistern.  Clause 66.   Section 14 of the Act of 1863, which is incorporated with theAct  of  1936,  empowers undertakers  who are authorised by their  SpecialAct to supply water  by measure, to let for hire, to consumers so supplied,meters  for measuring  the water, and pipes  or other apparatus  for  itsconveyance,  storage  or  reception.  The clause  extends  the powers  to theletting,  sale and repair of any  water fittings&quot;and&apos; to all consumers.  Under-takers are, however,  prohibited from  manufacturing fittings.. Similar pro-visions  are commonly allowed in Special Acts.   We do not  consider that local authorities supplying under  the  Act of 1936 should be given the wide powers  of this clause, and we have provided in the Second Schedule thatit shall apply in such  cases only in  relation to metered supplies, so con-tinuing the position under Section 14  of the Act of 1863.  Clause 67  is new.  It follows  Section 133 of the Act of 1936,  exceptthat we have provided that in the case of industrial supplies,  the powersshall not extend  to any fittings beyond the meter used by  the undertakersfor measuring water.  We have provided also in the Second  Schedule thatthe new clause shall  replace Section 133 of the Act of 1936.  Clause 68 reproduces  Section 17 of  the Act  of 1863, but the clause hasbeen  redrafted to conform with the  definition of water fittings  (Clause x.First Schedule).   It  is also  provided  that the  consumer  is  liable for the continuation of an offence, to meet the difficulty that the original  offenceis sometimes not discovered until it is too late  for proceedings to  be taken.  Clause 69.  The powers of Section  56 of the Act of 1847 for the  under-takers to repair cisterns, pipes, balls  or stopcocks,  so as to prevent waste,and to  recover the cost  from  the persons responsible,  are extended to  allwater fittings and to defects that may cause injury to person or property.The clause is based on Special Act provisions.   In  Sub-clause (2) provision is made for  the  recovery of expenses incurred  by the undertakers  on  the repair,  maintenance or renewal of supply pipes affording a common  supply to more than one house. This also  follows Special  Act provisions.  Clause 70.  Sub-clause (1) reproduces Section 58 of the Act of  1847, buta penalty  not exceeding  5  has been substituted  for the  forfeit  to  theundertakers provided in  the Section.   Sub-clause (2) reproduces Section 59of the Act of 1847 and 20 of the Act  of 1863, but a penalty  not  exceeding 5, to  correspond with penalties for  similar offences,  has been substitutedfor the maximum forfeit of  10  to the undertakers in the former  section.Sub-clause (3) reproduces the first part of Section 18 of the Act of 1863;that  section  also provides that  a consumer shall  not use water suppliedfor non-domestic purposes for any other purposes.   As  the water would
normally be taken by meter, and the charge made would correspond withthe quantity measured, this prohibition seems unnecessary, and  has there-fore been omitted.  Clause 71 follows Section 135 of the Act of 1936.  There  are no corre-sponding provisions in the Acts of 1847 and 1863, but similar powers arecommonly allowed in Special Acts.  Clause 72.  Section 60 of the Act of  1847 provides for a  forfeit to theundertakers of a sum  not exceeding  5, by any person breaking, damagingor opening apparatus  belonging to them, illegally taking water from theirworks,  or  wilfully doing  anything to cause  waste of their water.  Theclause,  which follows  Special Act  provisions,  strengthens the undertakers&apos;powers  - for  preventing  unauthorised  interference  with  their  works  orsupplies, and enables them  also to recover the  amount of any damagesustained.   A  fine not. exceeding   5  has been  substituted for the  forfeitprovided by the Act of  1847.  It is made clear  that the provisions do notapply to a consumer turning off or on a stopcock on his service pipe in caseof emergency, e.g., if a house  is temporarily  unoccupied  or repairs arerequired.              &apos;  Clause 73 reproduces Section 19 of the Act of  1863, but it is providedthat the provisions shall apply,  in the case of a metered supply, for tradepurposes, only to the pipe between the  main and the meter used by theundertakers for measuring the water supplied.  Sub-clause  (2) is also new.It is designed to meet the  difficulty that the original  offence is  sometimesnot discovered  until  it  is  too  late to take  proceedings.  Clauses  74  and  75   are  new.    Similar  provisions,  are  frequentlyallowed in Special Acts, but the restriction of the powers  of Clause  74 tometers used for the measurement of water for the  purposes of payment tothe undertakers is new.      Part XIV Pollution of  water  by manufacture, etc.,  of  gas.  Clause  76 reproduces similar  provisions in Sections 62  and  63  of theAct of 1847, but in accordance with the  recommendation-of the Committeein paragraph 15 of Part II of their  First Report, the  powers  have been extended to  the  escape of  washing or other liquid produced in  making orsupplying  gas  into the  subsoil in proximity  to any  spring, well  or aditof the water undertakers:  it is made  clear also that the provision applies to residual products of gas, some  of which may cause serious pollution ofwater.  We have substituted a maximum fine not exceeding  200 for thefirst offence and   20 for  a  continuing  offence for the  forfeit  of similarsums to the undertakers in the Act of 1847; but we have provided  that ifproceedings are taken in a court  of  summary jurisdiction, the  maximumpenalty for the  first  offence shall be  50.  Clause 77  reproduces  Section  64 of the Act of  1847, but fines  not ex-ceeding ^20  for  the  first  offence  and  10  for  a  continuing offence havebeen  substituted  for  the  forfeits  to  the undertakers of  similar  amounts in the Act of  1847.                       -  ,  Clause 78 reproduces Sections 65. to.67 of the Act of 1847.     Part  XV Financial  provisions  applicable to  water companies.  Clauses 79 to 81: are new, but are based oh Special Act provisions.  (Seeparagraph 34 of the Report.)  Clause  82 is new.  Paragraphs (a) and (b)  axe based  on Special Actprovisions.  Local authorities who are also water undertakers already havea general power to pay  superannuation and other  allowances to employees and  to establish  contributory  schemes  for the . purpose..   The  power inparagraph (c) to give  donations and subscriptions to charitable institutions,
sick and benevolent funds,  and other objects for the benefit of employeesis also based on Special Act provisions.  It is suggested in paragraph (d)that  undertakers should  also  be  empowered to  make  contributions  forfurthering research into matters concerning  their undertakings.   This isnew.  Clause 83  reproduces Section 83  of the  Act  of  1847,  but  has beenredrafted to  conform  with  the language used in  modern  Acts.                Part XVI General  and  miscellaneous.  Clause 84  is new.   The clause is  based on Section 275  of  the Act of1936 and on  similar powers commonly allowed  in  modern Special Acts.It is  to the consumer&apos;s  advantage that  the undertakers  should  be em-powered to  carry out  works in connection with  the provision  or repair of supply pipes if he so desires.  The  work is often  done  more  efficiently and at  less  cost than would otherwise be  the case.  Clause 85  is new.  Similar powers are contained in Section 297 of the act of 1933 in regard  to&apos; extracts from lists of annual values  prepared for thepurposes of Income Tax  under Schedule A.  Clause 86 is new.  It follows Section 283 (1)  of the Act of  1936.  Clause 87  is new.   The  clause is  based on  Section  284 of the  Act of1936.  Clause 88 is new.   It is based on Section 286 of the Act of 1936,  suitablyamended to  apply also to  companies.  Clause 89  is new.   The clause is  based on Section  285 of  the  Act of1936,  with amendments to meet the requirements of water companies.  Clause 90 is new.  Section 57 of the Act of 1847 empowers any autho-rised officer of the undertakers, to enter premises  supplied between 9 a.m.and 4 p.m.  to ascertain whether there is  waste  or  misuse of  water, and,if  admission is refused,  or  there  is  obstruction, to turn  off the water.Section 15 of the Act of 1863 provides a power of entry into any property to which water is supplied by  measure for inspecting meters  and otherfittings, for ascertaining the quantity of water used and for removing anyfittings which are the property of the  undertakers, any person obstructingthe authorised officer being liable to a penalty  not exceeding  5; except with the consent of  a justice  or the sheriff,  the power is to be exercisedonly between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.  Modern Special  Acts have extended the period  for entry for examination of meters  to  the period between 9 a.m. to  5 p.m.  A special power is  also frequently given  for entry between 7 a.m. and  sunset or 9 p.m.  whichever is  earlier,  in orderto examine  whether  there is waste or misuse of water, with power some-times to withdraw the supply, or to exact  a penalty if admission is refusedor the  authorised officer is obstructed in making the examination.  Wehave  recommended that there should be a general power of entry for anypurposes of  the undertaking,  and that  the  provisions of Section 287 ofthe Act of  1936 should be adopted  for the  purpose.  The right of entryat all reasonable  hours so provided, with the  fine not exceeding ^5  forobstruction  in Clause 91,  is considered sufficient to meet  the  need for aspecial power of entry to detect waste or  misuse of the water.   We have recommended, therefore, that the power to cut off water if there  is obstruc-tion should  not be continued.  Section  287  of the Act  of 1936  excludesfactories and  workshops from the  requirement that entry  shall  not be demanded  as  of right unless 24 hours&apos;  notice  of  the  intended  entry isgiven  to  the occupier.   It  is  considered  that  there are  no  grounds  fordistinguishing  between such premises and other  premises  supplied withwater,  and the clause omits this  distinction.
  Clause 91 is new.   It  follows Section 288 of the Act of 1936.  Clauses 92 to 98 are new.  They are based on  similar provisions  in theAct  of 1936 and in Special Acts.  Clause 99 is new.   We have followed  the  precedent of Section  303  of the  Act of 1936.  Clause 100  is new.   It follows Section 304 of  the  Act of 1936;  similarprovisions  are commonly allowed  in Special  Acts.  Clause 101  embodies the similar provisions of Sections  6 and  12  of theAct  of  1847  requiring the undertakers to  make  compensation  in respectof lands or streams  taken or  used  for the purposes of  the undertaking and  for  all  damage  sustained  by  interested persons  by  reason  of theexercise of the  powers of the  Special Act  in relation to those lands andstreams.(16659-26)  Wt. 3900 SS56 3000  4/39  P.

(3) When a notice has been given  under the  last   preceding subsection, then, so soon  as, after the expira-10 tion of three  months, the undertakers or authority giving   the notice commence to supply  water to the premises in   question,  the undertakers who obtained the  Ministers   order shall, except for the purpose of recovering  water   rates and water charges,  cease to  have any rights or15 duties  in  respect of a  supply  to those premises,  but   the undertakers or authority giving the notice shall  pay   to them such portion of  any  expenses  reasonably in-   curred  by them for the purpose of giving a supply to those   premises as may be agreed, or,  in default of agreement,20 determined by an arbitrator appointed by  the Minister.       (4) While undertakers are by  virtue  of an  order   made under  subsection (1) of this section authorised to   supply water outside  their limits of supply,  the enact-   ments  relating  to their undertaking  shall have  effect25 as if the  area specified in the  order were  within those   limits.  .       4.

(2) If in any such  case as aforesaid the  aggregate   amount of the  water rates  which  would be payable40 annually in respect of any premises in  an area is  not   sufficient  to  enable a valid requisition to  be made by   the owners  and  occupiers of those  premises, the local   authority may  undertake  that, until the water rates                             B 4

(2)&apos; Any  question arising under this  section  as towhether terms  and conditions  which the  undertakers  25seek to impose are reasonable, or whether they are justi-fied in refusing to give a supply,  shall be referred to,  and determined by, the Minister.     (3) The provisions of sections forty-three to forty-fiveand  forty-seven  of  the  First  Schedule  to this  Act  30(which relate to  the laying, maintenance  and vestingof supply pipes  and communication  pipes, &amp;c.)  shallapply in relation to a supply  of water  to be  given under this section as  they apply in relation to a supplyof water for domestic purposes to be given by undertakers 35to whom those sections are applicable.
