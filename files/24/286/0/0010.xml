CABINET.                        TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH SOUTH AFRICA.                          Memorandum by the Secretary of State                         .  for Dominion Affairs and the President                           of the Board of Trade.     We desire to bring to the attention of our colleaguesa point which has arisen in connection with the negotiationsfor the revision of the Ottawa Agreement with the Union ofSouth Africa.     It may be of advantage if we outline briefly thehistory of those negotiations.  In 1937 the Union delegation to the Imperial Conference announced their intention of negotiating a revision of the Ottawa Agreement.  they represented that the Agreement had, on the whole, operatedmore to our advantage than to theirs;  and that unless wecould grant increased preferences for their products, theywould find it necessary to ask us to agree to substantialmodifications in the preferences accorded to United kingdom goods in the Union.  The latter preferences, they said,hampered them in their efforts to negotiate trade agreements with other countries which might enable them to findalternative markets for their produce.  A case can he made out in rebuttal of the argument that the Ottawa agreement has operated more to our advantage than to that of the Union;but at that time, especially in view of the forthcoming negotiations with the United States of America, we were inthe position of having to refuse all the South Africanrequests for increased preferences and indeed of having toobtain their consent to a modification of some of theirexisting preferences in the United Kingdom.  We therefore                         -1-
found it necessary to take a somewhat defensive attitude inthe negotiations, and as a result of discussions between officials, a tentative agreement was reached in which we shouldhave submitted to some comparatively small reductions in ourpreferences in the Union.  This agreement was,  however,  rejected by Union Ministers.     Some desultory discussions have taken place since 1937between United Kingdom officials and the Union trade commissioner in London,  in which the United kingdom representatives refused to yield further in regard to the surrender of our preferences in the Union, and no progress was made.   A fortnight ago the Union High Commissionerintimated that he had received new instructions to the effectthat &quot;an effective preference by the United Kingdom on fruitmust be a &apos; sine qua non&apos;  to the renewal of the Ottawa Agreementor of any form of Imperial preference&quot; and that the UnionGovernment must have an immediate assurance that we will give such a preference:  other-wise the Ottawa Agreement would be denounced.  At a subsequent talk the High Commissioner saidthat his Government had mainly in mind oranges and grapefruit.When pressed on the subject of an effective preference being a1 sine qua non&apos;, he said that while this was not meant to bean ultimatum it was, in the view of his Government, impossibleto continue the Ottawa Agreement unless something effectivecould he done for citrus fruits.  By an &apos;effective&apos; preferencethe South Africans no doubt mean such a preference as willenable them to sell in the United Kingdom market at aremunerative price all the oranges they produce.  The Unionproducers&apos; real trouble is that there are many more orangesproduced in the world at the present time than can be sold
                                                          Ci f&quot; r&quot;                                                          iCd&apos;3profitably;  and an effective preference in the South Africansense could only mean a prohibitive duty or quota on foreignoranges.  Foreign oranges which compete with South Africanoranges come from the United States of America and from Brazil,and there is no possibility that we could agree to take actionwhich would shut out those imports.  When we-saw Mr. te Waterwe made this perfectly clear to him.     At the same time,- one of the chief reasons why v/e could agree to no increase in the preference on South Africanoranges, namely the trade negotiations with the United Statesof America, no longer holds good.  We feel that it might nowbe possible to contemplate some re-adjustment of the existingduties on oranges in such a way assto give the Union a widermargin of preference in the period which is of greatest importance to her trade, while compensating the foreigncountries who would be affected by reducing the duties outsidethat period.  Such a re-adjustment of the duties would not afford an &quot;effective preference&quot; in the South African sense;and in so far as it must involve increasing the duty on foreignoranges in certain months, it conflicts with our general principles in regard to any increase in tariff barriers andwould no doubt evoke protests from the United States of Americaand Brazil.  At the same time, the foreign countries involvedcould be,  to some extent, compensated by a reduction in theduty in other months and it may be noted that as the dutiesare almost entirely borne by the foreigner, the consumer inthis country would not suffer from such an arrangement.
                                                      O f&quot; f*                                                      Wj d Xi     Reports from our own High Commissioner, in the Union suggestthat the attitude of the Union High Commissioner in London isrepresentative rather of the policjr of Mr. Pirow, who hasrecently taken over the portfolio of Commerce, than of theUnion Government as a whole, and we are inclined to regard thepresent threat of denouncing the Ottawa Agreement as bluff,Following the grant of the existing preference on ox^angess totake only that item, the Union has doubled her exports to this market, and it  is hardly conceivable that she would be preparedto give up her present advantages.   At the same time we fee-lthat the possibility of granting the Union producers of orangeseven slightly increased advantages in this market might prove a disproportionately valuable bargain counter in the trade negotiations and might enable us to abandon our somewhatpassive attitude and not only to secure the retention of our existing preferences in the Union, but possibly to obtain alittle more.   The Union is now our largest export market( 39.. 5 million in 1938) and the Ottawa preferences have been most valuable to our trade.     The Union High Commissioner was prepared to recommend toHis Government that negotiations might be resumed on thebasis that the preferences on citrus fruits, together with allother concessions on either side, should be considered together.His vie1// was, however, that there was no chance of agreementunless something substantial was done for the Union citrusfruit industry.     We are bringing the matter before our colleagues atthis stage because any change of the preference.on SouthAfrican citrus fruit would arouse opposition in the UnitedStates of America and Brazil, and might cause criticismin this country owing to the fear that prices might be raised
and the coiisumption of citrus fruit, so desirable on healthgrounds, might be restricted.   Nevertheless we ourselves feelthat it is so important not to risk a breakdown of negotiations with the Union Government at this stage thatwe should not rule out the possibility of a readjustment ofthe duties on oranges of the kind indicated above.                                      T.W.H.I.                                      0.P.G..S.12th May, 1939.
