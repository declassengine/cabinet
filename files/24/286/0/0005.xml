We have been asi-ced to give our views as a matter of          great urgency on the balance of strategical value in war as          between Spain as an enemy and Russia as an ally.                                                                -          2.      We make our report in the following form:-                    (a)  Disadvantages to Great Britain and Prance                           of the entry of Spain into the war as an                           enemy.                    (b)  The advantages to Great Britain and Prance                           of an alliance with Russia.                    (c)  Other aspects.                    (d)  Conclusions.          Spain.          3.      If Spain was allied in war to Germany and Italy, the          following strategic disadvantages would ensue for Great Britain          and  Prance.          4.      The naval facilities at Gibraltar might be made largely          or even wholly unusable by land and air bombardment, and as  a          result  our control of the Straits, would be threatened.          5.      German and Italian submarines and aircraft operating          from Spanish territory including the Balearic and Canary Islands,          would add greatly to the difficulties of protecting our own          sea  communications in the Atlantic, and French          communications between North Africa and France, the more so
if the Mediterranean route were already closed.6.     Air attack could be brought to &quot;bear on the French&quot;bases in North Africa, the use of which by allied naval forces, if Gibraltar were not available, would be essential for the control of the Western Mediterranean.  Withoutthe use of these bases it wouia be difficult to interruptItalian trade from the Atlantic.7.     For France the entry of Spain into the war would entail the defence of a third land frontier  with a consequentdissipation of her resources.8.     Furthermore, the important French araamentiinduetr-Jas, in theSouth of France at Toulouse, the mouth of the Gironde, andat Tarbes could be menaced by air attack from Spain*  Inview of the shortage of their fighter aircraft, the Frenchtake a serious view of this possibility.9.     The Biscayan ports which would be used by the BritishField Force and by French formations from Africa would be within range of air attack from Northern Spain.10.    A French offensive from Tunisia against Libya wouldbe delayed until French communications had been secured bythe removal of the threat from Spanish. Morocco.
                                                        ft 9.        If Spain were hostile,  she could quickly  overrunPortugal and we should- not  he able to  use Lisbon  as  a base.12.     The strategic disadvantages summarised in thepreceding paragraphs are formidable.    It must, however,be borne in mind, with particular reference to theneutralisation of Gibraltar (para.4)  and the threat  tothe Franco-Spanish frontier (para.7)s  that the Spaniardsare war weary and in process of demobilisation, and  wouldprobably have little stomach for serious fighting;  thatthey would be subjected to a rigorous blockade (subject  to theextent to which the allied naval forces are able  effectively to maintain control of the Western Mediterranean);  thattheir resources in war material, particularly in  thematter of oil fuelage strictly limited;  and that theirmanufacturing capacity is meagre.  In these circumstances the disadvantages which we have enumerated may not be nearly so serious as they might appear to be at first sight 5  nor would they be of long duration, if our blockadeis successful.Russia.13.       The military value of Russia has recently  been thesubject of consideration in P.P. (36)  82, where theconclusion was reached:-          (a) The Russian Navy in the Baltic would:-              (i) Contain considerable German Naval  strength.             (ii) Interfere to some extent with the  Supply                   to Germany of Swedish iron ore.             (iii) Provide ports in the Baltic for our use                   if required.          (b) The Russian Navy in the Par East would:-                  Be an added deterrent to Japan from                   undertaking any large-scale operations                   against Australia,  New Zealand or                   Singapore.
0 ft(c)   The Russian Army in the  V/est     (i)   &quot;,/ould not &quot;be in a position to  afford           material support to Poland,    (ii)   &apos;-.-/ould not he in a position to  maintain, in           Roumania or in Turkey any Military           effort of a size which would  have a           material effect on the situation,   (iii)   Is likely to resist a German advance           through the Baltic States,    (iv)   ./ould contain substantial German forces           in the Eastern theatre in the event of           Poland and Roumania being overrun,(d)   The  Russian Army in the Par Sast:-          &apos;./ould exercise a containing influence  on           Japan and might be of some assistance to           Chinao(e)   The  Russian Air Force in the -Jest could:-(i)(ii)(iii)Produce a limited threat against Germany and Italy from advanced air bases in Poland, Roumania or Turkey if these countries.es consented to aircraft operating from their territories.Contain on the German Eastern frontier more German air defence units, than would, otherwise be allotted, for that purpose.Be of some assistance in strengthening the air defences of Poland,(f)   The Russian Air Forces East of Baikal, would       have a restraining influence on the Japanese,       contain some Japanese air forces and might       afford valuable assistance to China,(g)   Russia could not assist us or our allies to       any considerable extent by the supply of       war material, but her co-operation would       be invaluable in denying Russian sources of       raw material to Germany.14,    As regards the naval situation, the advantages are greatly minimised by the fact that the Russian BalticPorts are limited to the Gulf of Finland and are ice-freeonly for half the year.   It is only during this period there-fore that a proportion of the German naval strength wouldbe contained.
 15o     The  value  of  a Russian Alliance as fax1 as concerns direct  assistance, by land  or air, to Poland and Roumania is likely to be slights,   The Polish and Roumanian requirements of war  material might be met without a military alliance,, Other A-QpectSo, 160     If there is no alliance with Russia it is essential to retain sufficiently friendly relations with her to ensure not  only that the chances of Turkish co-operation with us are  not prejudiced out also that Russian resources are denied  to germany 17o    We cannot  overlook the danger which would result from a  rapprochement  between Germany and Russia - an aim which has been in the minds of the German General Staff for  many years.   A  combination of the German capacity for organisation with the material and man-power resources of Russia would not only eliminate all hope of saving Poland and  Roumania,  but would have repercussion throughout Europe and  in India,  the serious nature of which it would be difficult to exaggerate. IS.    We are not in a position to assess the degree of reliance that could be placed on any Russian undertaking.But  we would point out that the dangerous military consequences which would ensue if after we had contracted an alliance with Russia and made our dispositions accordingly, she were to withdraw from her obligations at the  last moment.
CONCLUSION.19.    To sum up, the active enmity of Spain, and the exploitation by Germany and Italy of the geographical position of Spain and her dependencies would weaken ourposition in the-Western Mediterranean and threaten ourAtlantic communications.       On the other hand, the war weariness of the spaniards, the inadequacy of their reserves of warmaterial, and their lack of manufacturing capacity,would progressively reduce the extent of the dangers towhich we would be liable in the opening stages of the war.20.    The active and whole-hearted assistance of russians our ally would be of great value, particularly incontaining substantial enemy forces and in supplying warmaterial to our other allies in Eastern Europe.   In thelatter respect, however, her contribution might be asreadily forthcoming if she remained neutral.21.    Assuming that if Russia is not with us she is atleast neutral, we consider that from the military pointof view, the advantages of an alliance with Russia wouldnot offset the disadvantages of the open hostility of spain.       On the other hand the greatest danger to whichthe British Empire could be exposed would be a  combination of Russia and Axis Powers.   If, therefore, the Cabinetconsider that there is a possibility of Russia joining the Axis Powers, either as a result of the failure of the
present negotiations or for any other reason an entirely new problem would arise.   We would request that in that event we should be fully informed of all the political implications, and be given an opportunity of reconsideringthe military position afresh.
