CONFIDENTIAL-FINAL REVISE   PALESTINEStatement of Policy
             STATEMENT   OF  POLICY  In  the  Statement on Palestine, issued on Qth November,1938,* His Majesty&apos;s Government annpuheed their intention to invite representatives of the Arabs of Palestine, of certain neigh-bouring countries and Of the Jewish Agency to confer with themin London regarding future  policy.   It Was their sincere hopethat, as a result bi full, free  and frank discussion, some under-standing might  be reached.   Conferences recently took place with Arab and Jewish delegations, lasting for a period of several weeks,  and served  the  purpose  of a  complete  exchangeof views between British  Ministers  and the  Arab and jewish representatives.  In the light of the discussions as well as of thesituation in Palestine and of the Reports of the Royal Com-missionf and the Partition Commission J, certain proposals wereformulated by His Majesty&apos;s Government arid were laid beforethe Arab arid  Jewish  delegations as the basis of  an agreed settlement.  Neither the Arab nor the Jewish delegations  felt able to accept these proposals,  and the conferences thereforedid not  result  in  an agreement.  Accordingly  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are free to formulate their own policy, and after careful consideration they have decided to adheire generally tothe proposals which were finally submitted  to,  and discussed with, the Arab  and Jewish  delegations.   2. The Mandate for Palestine, the terms of which were con-firmed by the  Council  of the League of Nations in 1922, hasgoverned the  policy  of  successive  British  Governments  for nearly 20 years.  It embodies the Balfour Declaration and im-poses on the Mandatory four main obligations.   These obliga-tions are set out in Articles 2, 6- and 13 of the Mandate.  Thereis no dispute regarding the interpretation of one of these obliga-tions, that  touching the protection  of and access to the holy places and religious buildings or sites.  The other three mainobligations  are  generally as  follows:         (i) To place the  country under such  political,  adminis-     trative and economic conditions as will secure the estab-     lishment in Palestine of a  national home for the Jewish     people, to facilitate  Jewish immigration under suitable     conditions, and to  encourage,  in  co-operation with  the     Jewish Agency, close settlement by Jews on the land.       (ii) To safeguard the civil and religious rights of all the     inhabitants of Palestine irrespective of  race and religion,     and, whilst facilitating Jewish immigration and settlement,     to ensure  that the rights and position of other sections of     the population are not prejudiced.       (iii)  To  place the country under such political, adminis-     trative and economic conditions as will  secure the develop-     ment of self-governing  institutions.          * Cmd. 5893.      f  Cmd. 5479.

  3. The  Royal  Commission and previous!  Commissions  ofEnquiry have drawn attention to the ambiguity of certain ex-pressions in the Mandate, such as the expression  &quot; a national home for  the Jewish people&quot;,  and they have found in. - thisambiguity  and the resulting uncertainty as  to the  objectives of policy a fundamental cause of unrest and hostility betweenArabs  and Jev/s.   His Majesty&apos;s Government are  convincedthat in the  interests  of the:  peace  and well-being of  thewhole  people of Palestine  a clear definition of policy and objectives is essential.  The proposal of partition recommendedby   the  Royal  Commission  would  have   afforded  suchclarity,  but the establishment  of self-supporting  independentArab and Jewish States within  Palestine has  been found to be impracticable.   It  has therefore  been  necessary  for  HisMajesty&apos;s Government to devise an alternative policy which will,consistently with their obligations to Arabs and Jews, meet theneeds of the situation in Palestine.  Their views and proposals are set forth below under the three heads,  (I)  The Constitution,(II) Immigration, and (III)  Land.  -                 -                    I. The Constitution.  4. It has been urged that  the expression &quot; a national home for  the Jewish people &quot;  offered  a prospect  that  Palestinemight in due course become a Jewish State or  Commonwealth.His  Majesty&apos;s Government  do not wish to  contest the  view,which was  expressed by the Royal Commission, that the Zionistleaders at  the time of the issue of the  Balfour Declarationrecognised  that an ultimate Jewish  State was not. precluded bythe terms of the Declaration.  But, with the Royal Commission,His  Majesty&apos;s: Government  believe that the  framers of  theMandate in which the Balfour Declaration was embodied couldnot  have  intended  that  Palestine should  be  converted into a jewish State  against the will of the Arab populationof thecountry. That Palestine was not to be converted into a jewish state might be held  to be implied in the passage from the command  Paper of 1922* which reads as follows:-  ;     &quot;Unauthorised statements have been made to.the. effect     that the purpose in view is to create a wholly Jewish Pales-&quot;v   tine,   Phrases have been used such as that &apos; Palestine is to &apos;;:  become as Jewish as England is English &apos;, His Majesty&apos;s : :   Government regard any such expectation as impracticable     and have no such aim in view.  Nor have they at any time     contemplated ....  . the disappearance or the subordination     of the  Arabic population, language or culture.in Palestine.     They  would draw  attention  to the fact  that the terms of     the; (Balfour) Declaration referred to do not contemplate     that Palestine  as  a whole  should  be  converted into a        &apos;*        &apos;.        * Cmd. 1700.       .     -   &quot; :  . 1637.9     .&apos;  &apos;        . .        . .                  A 2 -
-.   Jewish National Home,  but that such  a Home should    be founded in Palestine &quot;.  But this statement has not removed doubts, and His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore now declare unequivocally that it is not part  of  their policy that  Palestine should become  a Jewish State.  They would indeed  regard it as contrary  to  their obligations to the Arabs under the Mandate,  as well as to the assurances which have been given  to the Arab  people in the past, that the Arab population of Palestine should be made the subjects of a Jewish State against their will.   5.  The nature of the Jewish National Home in Palestine was further described in the Command Paper of 1922 as follows:           During the last two or three generations the Jews have     recreated in Palestine a community, now numbering 80,000,     of whom about one-fourth are farmers or workers upon the     land.  This community has  its own political organs; an    - elected assembly for the direction of its domestic concerns;     elected councils in the towns; and an organisation for the     control of its schools.  It has  its elected Chief Rabbinate     and Rabbinical Council for the  direction of its  religious     affairs.   Its business is  conducted in Hebrew  as a ver-     nacular language, and a Hebrew press serves its needs.   It     has its distinctive intellectual life and displays considerable     economic activity.  This community,  then, with its town      and country population, its political,  religious  and social      organisations, its own language,  its own&apos; customs, its own      life, has in fact &apos;  national &apos;  characteristics.  When it  is      asked what is meant by the  development of the Jewish      National Home in Palestine, it may be answered that it      is  not  the  imposition of  a Jewish nationality  upon the      inhabitants of Palestine as a whole, but the further develop-      ment of the existing Jewish community, with the assistance      of Jews in other parts of the world, in order that it may      become a  centre in which the Jewish people as&apos; a whole      may take,  on grounds of religion and race, an interest and      a  pride.   But in order that this community should have      the best prospect of free  development and provide a full      opportunity for the Jewish people to display its capacities,      it  is essential that it should know that it is in Palestine as      of right and not on sufferance.  That is the reason why it is      necessary that the existence of a Jewish National Home in      Palestine  should be internationally guaranteed,  and that it      should be  formally recognised to rest upon ancient historic      connection &quot;.    6. His Majesty&apos;s Government adhere to this interpretation of  the Declaration of 1917  and regard it as an authoritative and  comprehensive  description  of  the  character of  the Jewish  National  Home  in  Palestine.   It  envisaged ^ the  further   development  of  the  existing  Jewish  community with  the
assistance of Jews in other parts of the world.  Evidence thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government have been carrying out their obliga-tion in this  respect is to be found in the facts that,  since thestatement of 1922 was published, more than 300,000 Jews haveimmigrated to Palestine, and that the population of the national home has risen to some 450,000, or approaching  a third of theentire population of the country.  Nor has the  Jewish com-munity failed to take full advantage of the opportunities givento it.  The growth of the Jewish National Home and its achieve-ments in many fields are a remarkable constructive effort whichmust command the  admiration  of the world and must be, inparticular, a source of pride to the Jewish people.  7. In  the recent discussions the  Arab  delegations  haverepeated the contention that  Palestine was included within thearea in which Sir Henry McMahon, on behalf  of the BritishGovernment,  in  October, 1915, undertook  to  recognise  and support Arab independence.  The validity of this claim/basedon  the terms of  the correspondence  which passed  between sir Henry McMahon and the Sharif of Mecca, was thoroughlyand carefully investigated by British and Arab representativesduring the recent conferences in London.  Their Report, whichhas been  published,* states that both the Arab and the british representatives endeavoured to understand the point of view ofthe other party but that they were unable to reach agreement upon an interpretation of the  correspondence.  There is no need to summarise here the  arguments  presented by each . side.His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  regret   the  misunderstandingswhich  have arisen  as regards some  of the phrases used.  Fortheir part they can only adhere, for the reasons given by theirrepresentatives in  the  Report, to  the view that  the  wholeof  Palestine west  of  Jordan  was excluded  from &quot;Sir  HenryMcMahon&apos;s  pledge,  and they therefore cannot agree that theMcMahon correspondence forms a just basis for  the claim that palestine  should be  converted into an Arab State.  8. His  Majesty&apos;s Government are charged as the Mandatoryauthority &quot;  to secure the  development of self-governing institu-tions &quot;  in Palestine. Apart  from this  specific obligation, theywould regard it as contrary  to the whole spirit of the mandate system that the population of Palestine should remain for everunder Mandatory tutelage.  It is proper that  the  people ofthe country should as early as  possible enjoy the rights of self-government which are exercised by the people of neighbouring countries.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government are unable at present to foresee the exact constitutional forms which government inPalestine will eventually take, but their objective  is self-govern-ment, and they desire to  see established ultimately an indepen-dent Palestine State.  It should be a  State in which the two                         * Cmd. 5974.
peoples in Palestine,  Arabs and Jews,  share  authority  ingovernment in such a way that the essential interests of eachare secured.   .                           ..           ..&apos;  .  g. The  establishment of an independent State and the com-plete relinquishment of Mandatory control in  Palestine wouldrequire such  relations &quot;between the  Arabs  and  the  Jews  as would  make good government possible.  Moreover, the growth of self-governing institutions in Palestine, as in other  countries,must be an evolutionary process.  A  transitional period willbe required before independence is achieved, throughout whichultimate responsibility for the Government of the country willbe  retained by  His Majesty&apos;s Government  as  the Mandatoryauthority,  while the  people of  the  country  are  taking  an increasing share in the  Government, and understanding andco-operation  amongst them are  growing.   It  will  be  the constant endeavour of His Majesty&apos;s  Government to promotegood relations between the Arabs and the Jews.  10. In the light of these considerations His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment make the following  declaration of their intentions regard-ing the future government  of Palestine:         (i) The objective  of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government is the    establishment within ten years of an independent Palestine    State in such  treaty relations with the  United Kingdom    as  will  provide  satisfactorily  for the  commercial  and    strategic requirements of both countries in the future.  This    proposal  for  tire  establishment of  the  independent State    would involve consultation with the Council of the League    of Nations with a view to the termination of the Mandate.       (2) The independent State should be one in which Arabs    and. Jews share in government in such a way as to ensure    that  the essential interests of each community are  safe-    guarded.       (3) The establishment of the independent State will  be    preceded  by  a transitional period  throughout. which  His    Majesty&apos;s  Government  will  retain responsibility  for the    government  of  the  country.   During  the transitional    period the people of Palestine will be given  an  increasing    part in the  government of their country.  Both sections of   : the population will  have an  opportunity to participate in    the machinery of government,  and  the process will  be    carried on whether or not they both avail themselves of it.       (4)  As  soon as peace and order have  been  sufficiently    restored in Palestine steps will be taken to carry  out this    policy of  giving the people of Palestine an increasing part    in the government of their country, the objective being to    place Palestinians in  charge  of all  the  Departments  of    Government, with the  assistance of  British advisers and
subject to the control of me High Commissioner.  With thisobject in view His Majesty&apos;s Government will be preparedimmediately to arrange  that  Palestinians  shall be placedin charge of certain Departments, with British advisers.  the palestinian heads of Departments will sit on the ExecutiveCouncil, which advises the High Commissioner. Arab and jewish representatives will be invited to serve cis  heads of departments approximately in proportion to their respec-tiye populations.  The number of Palestinians in charge of departments will be  increased  as  circumstances permituntil all heads  of Departments are Palestinians, exercisingthe administrative  and  advisory  functions  which are  atpresent performed by British  officials.  When that stage isreached  consideration will, be given  to the  question  ofconverting  the Executive  Council into  a  Council  ofMinisters  with  a consequential change  in  the  status and functions  of the Palestinian heads of Departments.   (5) -His.Majesty&apos;s Government make no proposals at thisstage regarding the establishment of an elective legislature.Nevertheless they  would  regard this  as an  appropriateconstitutional development, and, should public opinion inPalestine  hereafter show itself in favour of such a develop-ment, they will be prepared, provided that local conditionspermit, to establish the necessary machinery.   (6) At the end of five years from the restoration of peace and order, an appropriate body representative of the peopleof  Palestine and of His  Majesty&apos;s Government will  beset  up  to  review  the  working   of  the constitutional arrangements during the transitional period and to consider and make recommendations  regarding  the  constitution ofthe independent Palestine  State.   (7).His Majesty&apos;s Government will require to be satisfiedthat in the treaty contemplated by sub-paragraph (1) orin  the  constitution contemplated  by  sub-paragraph  (6)adequate provision has  been made  for:         (a) the., security of,  and freedom of access.to, the     Holy Places, and the protection of the interests  and     property of the various religious bodies.       (&amp;-) the  protection  of the  different  communities     in  Palestine in accordance with the obligations of His  .  : Majesty&apos;s  Government to both Arabs  and Jews  and     for the special  position  in  Palestine  of  the  Jewish     National Home.       (c) such requirements  to meet the strategic situation     as may be  regarded as; necessary by His  Majesty&apos;s   -  Government  in&apos;the light of  the circumstances then   :  existing.  &apos;.
      His Majesty&apos;s Government will also require to be satisfied    that the interests of certain foreign countries in  Palestine,    for the preservation of which they are at present responsible,    are adequately safeguarded.      (8) His Majesty&apos;s Government will do  everything in    their power  to tpreate conditions which will enable the    independent Palestine State to come into being  within ten    years.   If,  at the end of ten  years, it appears  to His    Majesty&apos;s  Government  that,  contrary  to  their  hope,    circumstances require the  postponement of the  establish-    ment of the  independent  State,  they  will consult with    representatives of  the people of Palestine, the Council of    the League of Nations and the neighbouring Arab States    before  deciding on such a postponement.  If His Majesty&apos;s    Government come to the conclusion that postponement is    unavoidable,  they will  invite the co-operation of these    parties  in  framing plans  for the future with  a view  to    achieving the desired objective at the earliest possible date.  II.  During the transitional  period steps  will  be taken  toincrease  the  powers and responsibilities of municipal corpora-tions  and local councils.                      II. Immigration.  12. Under Article 6 of the  Mandate, the  Administration ofPalestine, &quot;  while ensuring that the rights and position  of other sections  of the population are  not prejudiced &quot;, is required to &apos;&apos; facilitate Jewish  immigration under  suitable  conditions &apos;&apos;.Beyond this, the extent to which Jewish immigration into Pales-tine is to be  permitted is nowhere defined in  the Mandate.  Butin the Command Paper of 1922 it was laid down that for the fulfilment of the policy of establishing a Jewish National Home     &quot;it is necessary  that the Jewish community in Palestine     should be  able to increase its numbers by immigration.     This immigration cannot be so great in volume as to exceed     whatever may be the economic capacity of the country at     the time to absorb new arrivals.  It  is essential to ensure     that the immigrants should not be a burden upon the people     of Palestine as a whole, and that they  should  not deprive     any section of the present  population of their ^employment.&quot;   In practice,  from that date onwards until recent times,  the economic  absorptive  capacity of the  country has been treated as the sole limiting factor, and in the letter  which Mr. Ramsay MacDonald,  as Prime  Minister,  sent  to   Dr.   Weizmann in February 1931*  it was  laid  down as a matter of policy that economic  absorptive  capacity was  the  sole  criterion. This  interpretation   has  been  supported  by  resolutions  of             * Hansard, Vol. 248, 13/2/31, Cols. 751-7^
 the  Permanent Mandates  Commission.   But  His  Majesty&apos;s-Government do not read either the Statement of Policy of 1922 or the letter of 1931 as implying that the Mandate requires them, for all time and. in all circumstances, to facilitate the  immi- gration of Jews into  Palestine subject only to consideration  of the country&apos;s economic absorptive capacity.  Nor do they find anything in the Mandate or in subsequent Statements of  Policy to support the view that the establishment of a Jewish National Home in  Palestine cannot be  effected unless immigration  is allowed to continue indefinitely.   If immigration has an adverse effect on the economic position in the country, it  should clearly be restricted; and equally, if it has a seriously damaging effect on the political position in the country, that is a factor that should not be  ignored.  Although it is not difficult to contend that  the large  number of Jewish immigrants who have been admitted so far have  been absorbed economically,  the fear of the Arabs that this influx will continue indefinitely until the Jewish population is in a position to  dominate them has pro- duced consequences which are  extremely grave  for  Jews and Arabs alike and for the peace and prosperity of Palestine.  The lamentable disturbances of the past  three years are  only the latest and most sustained  manifestation of  this intense Arab apprehension.   The  methods  employed by  Arab   terrorists against fellow-Arabs  and Jews alike  must receive unqualified condemnation.    But  it  cannot  be  denied  that   fear  of indefinite  Jewish  immigration  is  widespread  amongst the Arab population and that this fear has made possible disturb- ances which have given a serious setback to economic progress, depleted  the Palestine  exchequer,  rendered life  and property insecure,  and  produced  a bitterness between  the Arab and Jewish  populations  which is deplorable between citizens  of the  same  country.   If in these circumstances immigration  is continued up to the economic absorptive capacity of the country, regardless of all other considerations, a fatal enmity between the two peoples will be perpetuated, and  the situation in Palestine may become a permanent source of friction amongst all peoples in the Near and Middle East.  His Majesty&apos;s Government can- not take the view that either their obligations under the Mandate, or considerations of common sense and justice, require that they should ignore these circumstances in framing immigration policy.   13. In the view of the Royal Commission,  the association of the policy of the Balfour Declaration with the Mandate system implied the belief that Arab hostility to the former would sooner or later be overcome. It has been the hope of British Govern- ments ever  since the Balfour Declaration was  issued that in time the  Arab population,  recognizing  the advantages  to  be derived from Jewish settlement and  development in Palestine, would become  reconciled  to the further growth of the  Jewish
                              IP National Home. This hope has not been fulfilled.  The alterha-... fives before His Majesty.&apos;s Government are either (i) to seek to expand the Jewish National Home indefinitely by immigration, against the strongly expressed will of the Arab people of the country;  or (ii) to permit further expansion of  the  Jewish National Home by  immigration only if the Arabs are prepared to&quot; acquiesce in it.   The  former policy means rule by force.; Apart  from  other  considerations,  such   a policy seems to His Majesty&apos;s  Government  to be  contrary  to the whole  spirit of Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, as well-as fo their  specific  obligations  to  the Arabs in the Palestine Mandate.  Moreover, the relations  between the Arabs and the Jews  in Palestine  must be based  sooner or later on  mutual tolerance and goodwill; the  peace,,security and progress of the Jewish  National  Home  itself  require this.  Therefore His Majesty&apos;s Government, after earnest consideration, and taking into  account -the extent to which the growth  of  the  Jewish. National Home has been facilitated over the last twenty years, have decided that the  time  has come to adopt in principle the second of the alternatives referred to above.   14. sit has been urged that all further Jewish immigration into Palestine should be stopped forthwith.  His Majesty&apos;s Govern- meht cannot accept such a proposal.  It would damage the whole of the financial  and economic system of Palestine and thus  affect adversely the interests of Arabs and Jews alike.   Moreover, in the view  of His Majesty&apos;s Government, abruptly to stop further immigration would  be unjust to  the Jewish National Home.   But,  above all,  His  Majesty&apos;s Government are con- consious  of the  present  unhappy plight  of large  numbers of Jews: who seek a refuge from certain European countries, and they believe that Palestine can and should make a further con- tribution tb the solution of this pressing world problem.   In all these circumstances, they  believe that  they  will be  acting consistently with their Mandatory obligations to both Arabs and Jews, and in the manner best calculated to serve the interests of the whole  people  of  Palestine,  by  adopting the  following proposals regarding immigration:          (1)  Jewish immigration during the next five years will     be at a rate which,  if economic  absorptive capacity per-  \  mits, will bring the Jewish population up to approximately     one-third of the total population  of  the country.  Taking     into account  the  expected natural  increase of  the  Arab     and  Jewish  populations,  and   the  number  of   illegal     Jewish immigrants  now  in  the  country,  -this  would     allow   of  &quot; the  admission,  as  from  the beginning of    &apos; April  this -year,  of &quot;some  75,000  immigrants  over  the   &quot;  ;hext five-years.  - These, immigrants  would,  subject; to
   the criterion of economic absorptive capacity, be admitted   as follows: -          (a) For each of the next five years a quota of 10,000       Jewish  immigrants  will  be allowed, on the  Under-       standing that a shortage in any one year may be added       to the  quotas for subsequent years, Within the five-       year period, if economic absorptive capacity permits.          (0) In addition, as a contribution towards the solution       of the Jewish refugee problem, 25,000 refugees will be       admitted as soon  as the High Commissioner is  satisfied       that adequate  provision&apos;  for  their  maintenance is       ensured, special consideration being given to  refugee       children and dependants.      (2) The  existing machinery for ascertaining economic    absorptive  capacity will be  retained, and the High Com-    missioner will have the  ultimate responsibility for  deciding    the  limits  of economic  capacity.   Before  each  periodic    decision  is taken,  Jewish  and Arab  representatives  will    be consulted.      (3) After the  period  of five years rto  further Jewish    immigration will be permitted unless the Arabs of Palestine    are prepared to acquiesce in it.      (4) His Majesty&apos;s  Government are determined to check    illegal immigration,  arid further preventive  measures  are    being adopted.   The  numbers of any Jewish illegal immi-    grants who, despite these measures, inay succeed in coming    into  the  country and cannot be deported will be deducted    from the yearly quotas.  15. His MajestyV Government are  satisfied that, when  the immigration  over five  years which is  now  contemplated hastaken place, they, will  not be justified  in facilitating,  nor willthey be under any obligation to facilitate, the establishment ofthe Jewish  National Home by further immigration regardless of the wishes of the Arab population;                         II j. Land.   16. The Administration of Palestine is required, under Article6 pi the  Mandate;  &quot; while ensuring that the rights and positionof other sectiong of the population are not prejudiced &quot;, toencourage  &quot;close settlement by Jews on the  land &quot;, and no restriction has  been imposed hitherto on the transfer of  land from Arabs to Jews. The Reports of several expert Commissionshave indicated that, owing to the  natural growth of  the arab population and the steady sale in recent years of Arab land toJews, there is now in certain areas no room for further transfers of Arab  land, whilst in some other areas such transfers of land                                           .   .. .......   1

St.  G.33&apos;must be restricted if Arab  cultivators are to  maintain theirexisting standard of life and a considerable landless Arab popu-lation is not soon to be created.  In  these circumstances,  theHigh Commissioner will be  given general powers to prohibitand regulate transfers of land.  These powers will date from thepublication  of this statement of policy and the High. Commis-sioner will retain them throughout the transitional period.   17. The policy of the Government. will be directed towardsthe  development of the land  arid  the  improvement,  where possible, of  methods of cultivation.  In the light of such develop-ment it will be open to the  High Commissioner, should he besatisfied that the &quot; rights and position &quot; of the Arab population will be  duly preserved, to review and modify any orders passedrelating to the prohibition or restriction of the transfer of land.   18. In.framing these proposals His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave sincerely endeavoured to act in strict accordance with their obligations  under the Mandate to both the Arabs and the Jews. The vagueness of the  phrases  employed  in some instances to describe  these  obligations  has led  to  controversy and  has made  the  task  of  interpretation  difficult.    His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot hope to satisfy the partisans of one party or the  other in such controversy as the Mandate has aroused. Their purpose  is to be just  as between the  two  peoples in Palestine whose  destinies in that country have been  affected by the  great events of recent years, and who, since they live side by  side,, must learn to practise mutual tolerance,  goodwill and co-operation.  In looking to the future, His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment are not blind to the fact that some events of the past make the task  of  creating  these relations difficult;  but they  are encouraged by the knowledge that at many times and in many places  in Palestine during  recent years the Arab and Jewish inhabitants have lived in friendship together.  Each community has much to contribute to the welfare of their common land/and each must earnestly desire peace in which to assist in increasing the well-being of the whole people of the  country.  The respon- sibility which falls on them, no less  than upon His Majesty&apos;s Government, to co-operate together  to ensure  peace is all the more solemn because their  country is revered by many millions of Moslems, Jews and Christians throughout the world who pray for peace in Palestine and for the happiness of her people.
