WAR LEGISLATION - DEFENCE REGULATIONS.                APPLICATION AT THE ONSET OP EMERGENCY.                   Memorandum by the Minister fop                      Co-ordination of Defence.                 At their 556th Meeting held on  the 11th Lay,  1939,          the Committee of Imperial Defence had  under consideration          the Seventh Report by the Tar Legislation Sub-Committee          concerning the method of application of Defence          Regulations (C.I.D. Paper No.^1551-B).          2.     My colleagues will remember that the introduction          of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Dill (und.er the title of          the Exceptional Powers Defence Bill) was considered by the          Cabinet recently in connection with the Militate  Training          and. the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bills, and the          decision was re-affirmed that it was undesirable  to                                              -          introduce the Bill at the present time in &quot;oee.ce.                 Under this ruling; therefore, the Emergency              -          powers (Defence) Bill and the Defence  Regulations would not          be introduced until the outbreak of war, and the  War          Legislation Sub-Committee have hitherto addressed themselves          to the problem of the machinery by which Departments could          be armed without delay with the necessary powers  if          Parliament were not sitting.   To this end a Scheme was          approved bs^ the Committee    Imperial  Defence at  its 323th5  Cabinet 23(59)y Conclusion l.           -1-
Li: vJMeeting on the 30th June, 193 8, whereby a short Codeembodying those Defence Regulations essential forimmediate action would be applied at the outbreak of warby Orders-in-Council, and subsequently validated by ante-dating the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill, on thepassing of which the full code of Defence regulations would be issued and applied.,3.     During the discussion in the Committee of ImperialDefence on the 11th : ay, 1939, it became clear that two weaknesses were inherent in the arrangements now-contemplated: -         (a) that the issue pf a short Code to be followed               subsequently by the full Code of               Defence Regula/cions, would produce such               administrative difficulties as to be               virtual ly iniprac tic able .         (b) that no provision was made for Departments               to be a rued with essential powers before               the outbreak of war.4.     THE COMMITTEE OF lllPERLlL DEFENCE therefore agreed -         (a) that the procedure of issuing a short code               of Defence Regulations to be followed after               a brief period by the issue of the full               code is imprac t i c ab 1 e *         (b) To recommend to the Cabinet that, in principle.               (i) it is essential that the Defence                    Regulations should be applied at the                    onset of an emergency instead of only                    on the outbreak of war, as contemplated                    hitherto.              (ii) Subject to further consideration by the                    Defenco Departments, the moment at                    which it becomes necessary to order                    evacuation should be taken as the onset                    of an emergency, necessitating the                    application of Defence Regulations.             (iii ) Iji Parliament is sitting, the procedure                    to be adopted should be to introduce                    forthwith the Emergency Powers (Defence)                    Bill, and to publish the full code of                    Defence Regulations: Departments to                    be authorised to &quot;proceed to apply the
      Defence Regulations  immediately,  in anticipation      of the  passing of the Emergency Powers  (Defence)      Bill. (iv)  If an  emergency develops  when parliament  is  not       sitting,  the full code of Defence Regulations       should he applied by Orders-in-Council.  (v)  The exercise  of the  powers contained in the       Defence Regulations in anticipation of the       passing of the Emergency powers  (Defence)       Bill,  as  contemplated in (iii) and (iv),  should       be validated by. ante-dating the  Bill to the       date  on which the Regulations are made. (vi)  The arrangements for the issue of a. Defence       proclamation, set out in reconraendations       (d),  (e)  and (f) of the Fourth Report  of  the       War Legislation  :ub-Committee (C.I.D.  Paper       Ho. 1456-3), should apply if the procedure       recommended  in (iii) and (iv) above is       carried, out.(vii)  The-entries in the Government War Boole  should       be amended accordingly.5.

Paper No. 1549-B.)                    SEVENTH REPORT OF A SUB-COMMITTEE.                -   ,     IN our Fourth Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 1436-B), which was approved by the Committee of  Imperial Defence at their 328th Meeting  on the  30th June, 1938, my Committee drew attention to the possibility that war might break out suddenly at a time when Parliament was not sitting; in such a situation there would be a period  during which it would be essential for the Executive to take such measures as were immediately necessary  for purposes of defence, before the necessary powers had been conferred by  Parliament.  My Committee therefore proposed that, in order to define  in advance, so far as possible, the limits within which Departments should take such action, a short code of essential Regulations should be held in readiness for enactment by Order in Council at the outbreak of war and should be issued immediately;  any action taken under this code, so far as it required any authorisation,  would  be validated by giving to the Emergency Powers  (Defence) Bill retrospective effect as from the date on which the first of the Regulations was made.  The  scope of the Regulations which, it was proposed to include in this code of essential Regulations is set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of our Fourth Report.     2.   During recent months, as Departmental plans have become more precise, the practical difficulties of proceeding under the above arrangements have become more and more evident.  In every case in which provision is made for a Depart- mental  Order  under the  short  code of  Regulations it is necessary for  the Department to hold in  draft two Orders, one to be made under the  short code and one under the full code.  This duplication of work seems to be  unavoidable, because  otherwise  hopeless confusion will arise over the renumbering  of  the regulations when the long code repeals the short one. But to attempt to  substitute, a few days after the outbreak of war, a fresh set of orders and directions for those already issued under the short code of Regulations,  would be an almost  impossible task in the conditions of work which are likely to exist at such a time.   We have considered various  suggestions for  making  the numbering  of the short code conform to that of  the long code, but we have been obliged to reject them all as impracticable. . We have come therefore to the conclusion that where  Orders must. be made immediately on the outbreak of  war, by far the preferable course is that they should purport to  be made under the full code of Regulations to be made under the Emergency Powers (Defence)  Bill.    3.   Note must  also be taken of the fact that it is not proposed to  issue even the short code of Provisional Regulations until the  actual outbreak of hostilities, although it may well be that some Departments would be obliged to  take certain steps (e.g.,  requisitioning) without  any legal sanction,  before hostilities had actually broken out.    4.   We therefore suggest that, if a sudden emergency arose when parliament was not sitting, the  full  code of Regulations should be issued immediately on the      [19128]
outbreak of hostilities, to be validated, probably within a day  or  two, by  thepassing of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill,; which would be ante-dated totake effect from  the date on which  the Regulations were made.   To issue  inadvance of legislation a short code of Regulations selected from the full codewould, as  stated  above, give rise to very great administrative inconvenience  ata time when  it is essential that the administrative machinery should work  assmoothly as possible.  If our proposals should not be acceptable, it would, in our judgement,  be better  to proceed by administrative action  without  any formalRegulations  during  the  very  short  period necessary  for the passing of  theEmergency Powers (Defence) Bill and the issue of Regulations under it ratherthan to issue two codes in succession.  Indemnity for the action taken would  begiven by the  Bill.    5.  My Committee recognise, however, that exceptional circumstances might arise  in which the  course  proposed in our &quot;Fourth  Report might have to  beresorted to.  It might, for instance, be clear at the outbreak of  hostilities that parliament could not meet  for (say) a week; or the emergency might occurduring a dissolution of Parliament.  We recommend, therefore, that  a short code of Defence (Provisional) Regulations  should continue to be held in draft against such a contingency, but on the understanding that this code would only be usedin quite exceptional circumstances.    6.  In conclusion, we would  point out that the arrangements set out  inour Fourth Report for the issue of a general Defence Proclamation would  be equally appropriate to either of the two courses recommended in paragraph 4  ofthis Report, except that, if the second course were followed (i.e., no  Regulationswere issued until  the Defence Bill had become law), the draft Public Announce-ment given as Appendix II to our Fourth Report would require modification.                      SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.    7.  The  following summary  of  our  recommendations  is  appended  for convenience of reference :     (a)  If  a war  situation develops rapidly when Parliament is not sitting, the           full code of  Defence  Regulations  should  preferably  be  issued           immediately on the outbreak of  hostilities, to be validated shortly           afterwards by  ante-dating the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill  to           the date on which the Regulations were made.    (6)  Alternatively, on  account  of  the great administrative  inconvenience  of           issuing a short code of Defence Regulations in advance of the  full           code, Departments should  take essential action without the cover  of           Defence Regulations until the  full code of  Regulations has been           issued   immediately  on  the passing  of  the  Emergency  Powers           (Defence) Bill.    (c) The procedure set out in  recommendations (a)  and (b)  of  our Fourth           Report (paragraph  10) should be kept  in readiness for  use  only  in           highly exceptional circumstances.    (d)  That the  entries in the Government War Book should be amended so  as           to allow for the  procedure proposed in  recommendations (a)  and  (b)           above.    (e) That  the  arrangements for the issue of a Defence Proclamation set out           in  recommendations (d), (e) and (/)  of our Fourth  Report should           apply  equally  if either of the courses put forward in recommenda-           tions (a)  and (b)  above is followed, the draft  public announcement           set out in Appendix II  of that Report being amended as necessary  in           the light of the circumstances at the time.

[Previous reference :  C.I.D. Minutes  of the 328th Meeting, Minute 2.)     THE COMMITTEE had  under consideration the Seventh Report  of theWar  Legislation   Sub-Committee,  concerning   the  application  of  defence regulations (C.I.D. Paper No. 1551-B).     SIR CLAUD SCHUSTER, reminded the Committee that, in their fouth report, the  War Legislation Sub-Committee had proposed that a short code ofDefence Regulations should be issued immediately on the outbreak of  war, thelong code waiting for the passing of the  Defence Bill.  The Departments had found  that this procedure was likely to lead to great confusion administratively.He himself  was convinced that it was completely unworkable, and would causeextreme difficulties and delay at a time when everything should be done withthe utmost despatch.  His Sub-Committee therefore proposed that the full code of Defence Regulations should be introduced, if necessary, without the authorityof the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill, although the  code  went beyond the prerogative  and beyond the scope of Orders-in-Council.  The  procedure  would,of course, be validated by the passing of the Defence Bill shortly afterwards.  Theonly alternative was some form of peacetime legislation and this had already beenconsidered and  rejected.  The proposal was undoubtedly violent, and thoughmorally justifiable  would have no backing in law.     LORD  CHATFIELD   pointed out   that  under  the  proposal  defence regulations would only be applied on the outbreak of war. He asked whethermeans  could be devised for  powers  during the precautionary period.     SIR CLAUD SCHUSTER said that difficulties would always arise  unlessthe full code were  applied.     SIR  SAMUEL  HOARE  supported the  recommendation  of the Sub-Committee to apply the full code by Order-in-Council on the outbreak of war.He felt that no distinction should be drawn between different parts of the code.Once war had begun the country would welcome  comprehensive action.     SIR JOHN ANDERSON was  perturbed at the lack of powers during thepreparatory period.  At the  present moment we had either to take the necessary powers in peace  or to rely on getting them in some form or other after war had broken out.  He would like to see powers introduced as soon as the Governmentbegan  to take emergency  action, such as  evacuation, which would  show that war  was practically inevitable.  They could not afford to wait until hostilitiesbroke out.       [19254-2]
    SIR  THOMAS  INSKIP suggested that  Defence Regulations  might beissued after an affirmation by Parliament that an emergency had arisen.  Theyshould face the issue in peace and publish the Bill and Regulations so that allconcerned would be aware of the  provisions of the code before it was applied.It would  be important in the stress  of  emergency to ensure publication anddistribution of its provisions in time.    SIR CLAUD SCHUSTER pointed out that this would mean disclosing theprovisions of theBill and Regulations, some of which were, very drastic, involvingsevere penalties, deprivation of liberty and so forth.    SIR  THOMAS INSKIP said that he was not proposing to pass the bill into law in peace, but only to publish&apos;its provisions.    SIR KINGSLEY WOOD thought and the Committee agreed that publication in peace was inadvisable.    MR. MORRISON said that the Food (Defence Plans) Department would haveto take action during the  precautionary period to prevent a rise  in prices.  Forthis they would need the cover of Defence Regulations.   The necessary regulationscould be distributed to wholesalers and  retailers very quickly.    SIR JOHN ANDERSON enquired whether his suggestion that evacuationshould be  taken as a guide to the  time when the Regulations should be  appliedwas acceptable to the Defence Departments.    SIR SAMUEL HOARE pointed out that  during  the September 1938 crisisthis proposal would have worked extremely well.    LORD STANHOPE was prepared to accept the proposal for the Admiralty.    SIR KINGSLEY WOOD agreed with the principle that Defence Regula-tions  should be applied as soon as war appeared inevitable, but preferred toconsider further whether evacuation was a suitable guide to this condition.  he felt that publication of the Bill and Regulations now in time of peace would leadto the most serious difficulties.    SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested that the problem should be laid beforethe Cabinet for a decision in principle.    SIR CLAUD SCHUSTER said that an early decision was essential sincevery comprehensive preparations in the way of printing of  notices and so forthwere required of Departments.  If a  decision in principle could be given,  thedetails could be quickly worked out.                               CONCLUSIONS.    THE COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE agreed :     (a) That the procedure of issuing  a short code of Defence Regulations to be           followed  after  a brief period  by  the issue of the  full  code  is           impracticable.    (b) To recommend to  the Cabinet that, in principle :            (i) It is essential that  the Defence Regulations should be applied at                 the otSset of an  emergency, instead  of only on the outbreak of                 war, as  contemplated hitherto.          (ii) Subject to further consideration by the  Defence Departments, the                 moment  at  which it becomes  necessary  to order evacuation                 should be taken as the onset of an emergency, necessitating the                 application of Defence Regulations.          (iii) If Parliament is sitting, the procedure to be adopted should be to                 introduce forthwith the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill, and                 to publish the full code of Defence Regulations; Departments                 to be authorised  to proceed to apply the Defence Regulations                 immediately, in  anticipation  of  the passing of the Emergency                 Powers  (Defence) Bill.          (iv) If an emergency develops when Parliament is not  sitting,  the full                 code of  Defence  Regulations should be applied by Orders-in-                 Council.
  (v)  The exercise of the powers contained in the Defence Regulations        in  anticipation of  the passing  of the  Emergency Powers        (Defence) Bill,  as contemplated in (iii) and (iv),  should be        validated by antedating the Bill  to  the date on which the        Regulations are made. (vi)  The arrangements for the issue of a Defence Proclamation, set out        in recommendations (d), (e) and (/) of the Fourth Report of the        War Legislation  Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1436-B),        should  apply if the procedure recommended in (iii) and (iv)        above is carried out.(vii)  The entries  in the  Government  War  Book  should be amended        accordingly.JZ.
