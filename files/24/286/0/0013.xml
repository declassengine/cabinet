9ohi udDraft telegram to   Sir W. Seeds,      Moscow.No.....Cypher.Repeat:ParisBerlinAngoraBucharestWarsaw       Your telegram No. 93 (of 14th May:communication from the Soviet Government).1.     I have given much thought to the Sovietreply  and am anxious to go as far as possibleto meet position of the Soviet Government.  Myfirst  difficulty is to understand the meaningwhich  the Soviet Government attribute to the term&quot;reciprocity&quot;.  Whatever shortcomings our proposal may have from the Soviet point of view,lack of reciprocity cannot fairly be said to be one of them. It is true that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ do not offer the Soviet government an undertaking of assistance in the event of adirect attack upon the Soviet Union.  But nor,on the other hand, do His Majesty&apos;s Governmentask the Soviet Government for an undertaking ofassistance in the event of a direct attack upon the United Kingdom.  Then again, it is truethat His Majesty&apos;s Government have not under-taken to extend their guarantee to Finland,Estonia and Latvia.  But nor, for their part,do His Majesty&apos;s Government ask the SovietGovernment to extend their guarantee, forexample, to Belgium and Holland.   Indeed, asI have observed before, (see paragraph 3 ofmy telegram No.  9y), His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare asking the Soviet Government to do some-thing less than they are undertaking to dothemselves, so that if there is any lack of
reciprocity, the disadvantage would seem to lie with His Majesty&apos;s Government rather than with theSoviet Government.2.     The real ground of objection which theSoviet Government appear to have to our proposal is not, as I understand its a matter of reciprocity(properly so-called) at all, &quot;but arises from theirfeeling that a difference exists between thesituation of the Soviet Union and that of GreatBritain, Prance and Poland.  The latter have allmade reciprocal arrangements of mutual assistanceamongst themselves., whereas the Soviet Union hasno such arrangement except the Franco-SovietPact.  The Soviet Government accordingly can claim that whereas Great Britain, France and Poland allreceive something in return for the undertakingsinto which they have entered they themselvesreceive nothing in return for the declaration with we ask them to make.  The Soviet government also seem to fear that the mere fact of theirmaking t;ao  proposed declaration might provoke a direct attack upon the Soviet Unionby Germany, and that in the absence of
9 O87a direct guarantee from Great Britain and Pranceto meet this contingency and in the absence also ofa guarantee by Great Britain and Prance to Latvia,Estonia and Finland, such an attack might be aimed at the Soviet Union through those countries.3.        His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to do their best to meet these objections, and in my immediately following telegram I send you the text of a draft agreement designed for that purpose.   Iwould, however, by way of preface, first indicate thedifficulties which the three conditions in the formset out in paragraph 3 of your telegram under reference in point of fact present.4.        As regards point (l), I have already,  inparagraph 4 of my telegram Ho. 99, indicated theobjections to the conclusion of a general pact of mutual assistance between Great Britain, France and theSoviet Union.    HisMajesty&apos;s Government e&amp;tertaingrave doubts whether the conclusion of sush a pactwould in fact facilitate the general organisation of security against aggression which it is the object ofthe Soviet Government to achieve.   Furthermore inpractice the Soviet Government could not render
effective assistance to  Great Britain  and France, if the latter were the  object  of  a  direct attack, except through  Poland  and in  a lesser degree Roumania.     His Majesty&apos;s Government fear that by accepting  a direct  guarantee  from the Soviet Union with this obvious  implication they would place Poland and Roumania  in an embarrassing position which His Majesty&apos;s Governments own proposals are expressly designed to avoid.   So far as concerns a  direct undertaking by His &quot;Majesty1s Government  to the Soviet Government, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government think that the effect of this  would for all practical purposes be achieved by the new proposal contained in my immediately  following telegram. 5.        As regards point (2),  there is one insuperable objection to the offer  of a three Power guarantee to the  States  of Central and Eastern Europe among which the Soviet Government propose to include Latvia, Estonia  and  Finland. These three States have let it he known to His Majesty&apos;s Government with varying degrees  of emphasis that they do not wish to enter into any treaty arrangement which would  provide for assistance to them  by the  Soviet  Unions or to be made the subject of any  treaty
Alternative (a).6.  As regardspoint (3) HisMajesty1sGovernment have,as yon will see,gone a good way tomeet the Sovietpoint of view inparagraph 3 of thedraft agreement which they are nowproposing.arrangement concluded hy other Powers which wouldhave this effect.   In view of the attitude adopted by these countries, His Majesty&apos;s government do not think that they could be made the subject ofany agreement between Great Britain, Prance andthe Soviet Union.Alternative (b).6.     As regards point (3), His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave, as you will see, gone to very great lengthsto meet the Soviet point of view in the comprehensiveprovision contained in paragraph 3 of the draft agreement which they are now proposing.7.     In view of the foregoing, the principalpreoccupations of the Soviet Government would bemet if Great Britain, Prance and the Soviet Unioncould enter into an arrangement in the termsof the draft given in my immediately following telegram.8.     By paragraph 1 of that draft, the three governments exchange reciprocal assurances of mutual support and assistance in the event of thecoming into operation, (a) of the delcarationa made by great Britain and Prance in respect of Poland and roumania;  and (b)  of the declaration which, accordingto our existing proposal, should be made in respect ofthese two countries by the Soviet Government.
Alternative (a).11.  Paragraph 3makes provision forconversations inregard to the variouscontingencies thatmight arise underparagraphs (1)  and. (2).                                            *J &apos;J9,   By paragraph 2 the three Governmentsexchange assurances of mutual support and assistance in the event of any of thembeing the object of aggression by a european power as the result of the making of theabove-mentioned declarations or of theconclusion of proposed arrangement of mutual assistance given in my immediately following telegram.10.  Paragraph 1 would thus assure theSoviet Union of the assistance of GreatBritain and Prance in the event of an attack upon her by Germany through Poland orRoumania.   Paragraph 2 would in addition .assure the Soviet Union of the  assistanceof Great Britain and Prance, in the circumstances there postulated, in the event of a direct attack upon her by Germany, or of an attack upon her by Germany through the Baltic States.You will note that His Majesty&apos;s government wish to confine the assistance of Prance andGreat Britain to a case where the soviet union is attacked as a result of having made the declarations or entered into the agreementreferred to in the present telegram.Alternative (b).11.   Paragraph 3 makes provision for the/immediate^ opening of conversations betweenthe three countries in regard to the variouscontingencies that might arise under paragraph (l) and (2).

Telegrams to Moscow.Draft Telegrams       THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidto Moscow.                 that the two draft telegrams in question went as far                 as he thought was right to answer the Russian objections                 and to state our own position persuasively.   The first                 and longer telegram was argumentative and the second                 contained the text of a draft Agreement,  He explained                 that alternative paragraphs 3 (a) and 3 (b) in the                 shorter telegram corresponded to alternative paragraphs                 6 (a) and 6 (b) in the longer telegram.  He had thought                 that it might be worth while to try first  alternative                 3 (a), (that is, the offer of consult ation between the                 two Governments as to the manner in which mutual support                 and assistance could be made most effective) as this                 would give us some room for negotiation.   On the whole,                 however, he had reached the conclusion  that the best                 course would be to adopt alternative  3  (b) forthwith,                 and to offer at once to concert  together as to the                 methods as to how mutual support and  assistance could                 be made most effective.                      The Foreign Secretary said  that  since the telegrams                 had been drafted, Sir Robert Vansittart had had a long                 discussion with ivi. Maisky.  The Foreign Secretary read                 out an account of this interview (which&apos;is attached as                 Appendix I.).   It emerged from this account that it                 was M. Maisky and not M. Potemkin who was  proceeding                 to Geneva.                      On the PRIME MINISTER&apos;S suggestion, it was agreed                 to consider first the short telegram.
                                                             2f\ t        In reply to a question &quot;by  the  Prime  Minister,  THE  FOREIGN SECRETARY said that this telegram had been  deliberately drawn up as  a more formal document  than the Agreement which we  had signed with Poland.    This  had &quot;been done  in order to  make the document as impressive as possible to Russia,.    No doubt, this made the Agreement rather look more like  an Alliance.   It would,  of course,  &quot;be possible to  cast the document into the form,  not of an Agreement,  but of Declarations  to be  signed  by the parties.    But this  would not make any  very material  change in the  form  of  the document.        THE  CHANCELLOR OF THE  EXCHEQUER said that the  proposal contained in this  document  did not really do what Russia  asked us to  do5 but represented an  attempt  to set out  our proposal in a way  in  which  it  would  appeal to  Russia.-    It appeared tohim that  the Russian  Government was still entitled to  say thatwe were  only undertaking to help  Russia if  Russia became  involved in war  as a  result of aggression  having taken place againstPoland  or Roumania..       THE FOREIGN SECRETARY  pointed  out  that there was a  furthersafeguard which he was proposing  to offer Russia.   If  Germanyattacked Russia because  she had signed this Agreement,paragraph 2 would  operate, and Prance  and Great  Britain wouldthen be called upon to lend Russia their  support.   On  theother hand,  if Germany attacked Lithuania and Latvia and Russiacame to their assistance, we  should not be  obliged to come toRussia&apos;s help.       THE MINISTER FOR  CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE  asked, withreference to paragraph 2, who would determine whether aggressionresulted from the making  of the present Agreement.       THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was  in favour of the omission of the words  &quot;of the making  of the present agreement&quot;in paragraph 3,                       -2-
                        THE MINISTER FOR GO-ORDIKATIOK OF DEFENCE said that                  he  had asked the Chiefs of Staff to consider the position ^U.M5u.JL^t-of     afresh^and had had a meeting with them that morning, a   0         /         The Chiefs of Staff  had held a. further meeting in the^LM^JIJ y ^( ^ oOro^c afternoon and had set out  their views in writing.   As the , ^.y     ,    Wo .   result of further consideration of the matter,  the Chiefs                  of  Staff had now somewhat  modified their views.                        The Minister for- Co-ordination of Defence then read                  out a Memorandum &quot;by the Chiefs of Staff which is appended                  to  these Minutes as Appendix IIn   He also read out a note                  in  which the Chiefs of Staff set out their views,  after                  further consideration.,  as  to the extent of the disadvant-                  ages which we should suffer if, in the event of war,  Spain                  became an ally of Germany  and Italy-   (This note is now                  paragraph 8 of Appendix II)0                        In reply to a question, Lord Chatfield said that by                  &apos;waverers&apos;  the Chiefs of Staff referred to countries in                  south-eastern Europe such  as Bulgaria,  Yugo-Slavia and                  perhaps Greece.                        In short,  failure to reach agreement with Russia                  might result in Russia standing aside in a future European                  war and hoping thereby to  secure advantages from the                  exhaustion of the western  nations.  -3?he. Chiefs of Staffg                 .thought that Russia had some grievance on the reciprocity                  point.   The Anglo-Polish  guarantee was a reciprocal one but                  we  had pressed Russia to give a guarantee to Poland                  without offering her any quid pro quo.                        THE PRIME MINISTER did not agree with this present-                  ation of our proposals.    . n paragraph 7 of Telegram 99 to                  Moscow, our suggested formula read as follows :-
   &quot;It is suggested that the Soviet Government    should make a public declaration on their own    initiative in which, after referring to the    general statement of policy recently made by       Stalin, and having regard to statements    recently made by His Majesty&apos;s Government and    the French Government accepting new obligations    on behalf of certain Eastern European countries,    the Soviet Goveriiment would undertake that in    the event of Great  Britain and France being    involved in hostilities in fulfilment of these    obligations, the  assistance of the Soviet Govern-    ment  would be  immediately available, if desired,    and would be afforded in such  manner and on  such    terms as might be agreed&quot;.    THE MINISTER FOR  CO-ORDINATION  OF DEFENCE  said  that  asthe Chiefs of Staff viewed the matter if,  apart  from anyquestion of aggression against Poland and Roumania,Germany were to attack Russia,  the latter could not look to us for help.    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatthismight have been the  position under our former proposalbut it was not so under the proposals in paragraph 2 ofthe shorter draft Telegram to Moscow (F.P. (3&apos;G) 90.    THE MINISTER FOR  CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE stated thatin the opinion of  the  Jhiefs of Staff we should  enterinto  an agreement  with Russia am a reciprocal basis for mutual support and assistance so that if either  Power were attacked  in Europe the other would at once come  to her assistance.   Great Britain  could be  attacked in many ways directly  or indirectly but,  apart  from  Poland and Roumania, Soviet Russia could only be attacked on the  Baltic or through the Baltic States,  such an attack would be most difficult to undertake with any hope of success,for the reasons given by the Chiefs of Staff.   In these circum- stances we had much to gain and very little to  lose by adopting  the policy  favoured by the Chiefs of Staff.      THE  CHANCELLOR OF  THE EXCHEQUER pointed out that the policy vis &amp; vis  Soviet Russia now favoured by  the Jhiefs
of Staff differed substantially from the views which theyhad expressed in their Reports of 24-th0  April and 10th.May (P.P. (36) 32 and Go P.  103 (39)),   THE MINISTER FOR JO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE reminded theCommittee of the most recent views of the.Chiefs of Staffin regard to Spain as set out in paragraph 8 of appendix ii to these conclusions.   He agreed that the relative importance to us of Russia and Spain as  allies ar enemiesinvolved very difficult strategical problems and was opento endless argumento   THE PRIME MINISTER inquired whether the present viewsof the Chiefs of Staff were based on an assumption thatwe were unlikely to get any agreement with Russia unlessthe agreement took the form of a full Pact such as russia was demanding.   THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE thought thatthis correctly represented the position.  No doubt someof the considerations which weighed with the Chiefs ofStaff were political considerations such as the fear thatif her demands were rejected Russia might decide on apolicy of neutrality and isolation.   THE PRESIDENT OF TEE BOARD OF TRADE observed that theChiefs of Staff had also deprecated the use of vague andindefinite language in regard to commitments with.particular reference to the wording of paragraph 2 of th-shorter draft Telegram.   THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE said thatthe Chiefs of Staff would prefer that paragraph 2 on the                          &quot;&apos;,J*last page of the shorter telegram should be altered to read :-         &quot;(2) In the event of any of the three              Governments being involved in war-              in consequence of an. aggression, ,              each of tne other Governments will              give it all the support and assistance              in its power&quot;o
       The ChiefS..JD -Staff were very .anxious that russia should he.,giv-en no.- excuse for evading her commitments and&quot;&quot;Teaving us in the lurch a:id they accordingly attached great importance to the use of precise and definite                                 oflanguage in regard,to the meaning/which there could beno misunderstanding..       THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the Committee that inthis matter regard must be had to the political as wellas the military and. strategical considerations.  TheJhiefs of Staff had rightly, from their point of view,stressed considerations of a military and strategicalcharacter, but if these considerations pointed in onedirection and the political considerations pointed in another direction, while due regard must be had to theformer, care must also be taken not to overlook theimportance of the latter.  He himself -wondered whetherthe present appreciation of the Chiefs of Staff might notbe based on the supposition that it was not possible tomake any arrangement with Russia unless v/e were preparedto enter into a full alliance with her.  In view, however,of Sir Robert VansittartJs interview withM. Maiskythis assumption might .prove incorrecto   It should alsobe remembered that under ,our proposals Russia would notnecessarily become involved in war rising say, out of aggression by Germany on the -Low Countries which&quot; would cause Prance and ourselves to go to war with Germany.       THE MINISTER FOR Ci 0 -ORE IN AT I Oft OP DEFENCE saidthat the Chiefs of Staff were very anxious that. russia should not.c in any circumstances, become allied with.Germany.   From the military point of view such aneventuality wou].d create a most dangerous situation forus.   The object of the alteration to paragraph 2 which hehad suggested was to ensure that if v/e were attacked byGermany in Europe,  Russia would come to our assistance.                   -6 -
       THE PRIME MINISTER suggested the inclusion of thewords &quot;if desired&quot; before the words &quot;give it all thesupport and assistance in its power,&quot; in paragraph 2of the shorter draft telegram..prepared to go as far as was contemplated in the draft telegrams, it was worth going somewhat further in orderto conclude an arrangement with Russia.   He did noxattach MgsSF importance to the argument that by so doingwe should alienate Spain and throw her into, the German-Italian camp. g^u^ ^U^J OSL^-O^OIUJ ^Ji A -L oiX-c^t^-^,, ca^.       THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE thought thatthe new proposals contained in the two draft telegrams ,2 of the shorter telegram, he did not see how it was possible for us to maintain and justify the arguments contained in the longer telegram.    No doubt these arguments were logioally based on the guarantees which we had  given to Poland and Roumania but from this point of view paragraph 2 might well be  of little help to us unless  indeed the Germans were foolish  enough to base aggression against Poland or Roumania on the making of this agreement or on the&apos; declarations contained in it. The time factor must also be taken into account and Russia would always be able to argue that a particular aggression by Germany had nothing to do with  this document.   In view of difficulties of this nature,, would it not be  preferable-to go the  whole way and get  the advantages  which the Chiefs  of  Staff had stressed by tying Russia up andTHE HOME SECRETARY thought that, if we weregave us the worst of both worlds.In view of paragraph
                                                        0 &quot;f\ *                                                        tii \J 1 ensuring that  if  in any circumstances  Germany attacked us Russia would be hound to come  to  our assistance?  A recipieocal.  arrangement of  this kind would, in his opinion, mean  that Russia  would have to do far  more  for us than we might  have  to  do for Russia,,        THE PRIME  MINISTER said that he would have preferred the omission of the  words &quot;of  the making  of the  present agreement&quot; so as to  limit paragraph 2 to cases of aggression against Poland or Roumania e   It seemed  to him  inconceivable that  the signing  of an agreement  in the form now proposed would in itself cause Germany  to  attack Russia either in the Baltic or  through the Baltic  Stages.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointed out that  the object of paragraph  1 was to ensure that if Russia assisted either Poland  or  Roumania within the scope of the document,  France Russia and ourselves would become engaged with all  our forces  in resisting  the act of aggression.    Paragraph 2 on the  other hand was  designed to protect Russia against  the  possibility of a vindictive attackbeing made upon her because  she had entered into thisparticular comrni tment0        THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION  OF  DEFENCE objected to the  wording of paragraph 2  because  under it Ru.russia mightbe able, in six months&apos;  time, to escape  from  her obligationsby alleging  that Germany&apos;s  act of aggression had nothing to do  with this declaration by Russia,        THE PRIME MINISTER enquired what effective helpRussia  corld in fact  give us,        THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION  OF DEFENCE, in replyreferred to  the information contained  in CP.  108 (39)a
9 n *)&amp; y &amp;The active AND whole-hearted assistance of Russia as our ally would HE of gji&quot;ii*U; value particularly incontaining substantial enemy forces ANA in supplyingwar material to our other allies IN Eastern Europe.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSdoubted whether Russia could help us much except throughPoland and Roumanian,  If, however,, WE entered into a firm pact with Russia WE olaced Poland and Roumaniain a position of great difficulty and embarrassment.He felt that while the military arguments for a Pactwere sound the political arguments against a Pact wereAIARE formidable.  HE agreed THAT THE uncertainty whichmight arise on THE interpretation of paragraph 2 wasa disadvantage.  As drafted THAT paragraph did not contemplate a fully fledged. Pact but one in effectlimited IN scope to THE TERRAIN, of Poland AND Roumania.The proposals of THE Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence and the Chiefs of Staff contemplated, on theother hand,.  . a  close triple alliance between. RussiasFrance and this country,,       THE PRESIDENT OP THE 30ARD CP TRADE enquire whether under paragraph 2 Russia would not be boundto go to our assistance IN the event of A German attackon France.       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat this was so but Russia would go to war in such acase because of her commitment to Poland.       THE CILiNCElLOR Of THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER pointedout that the arrangements with Russia contemplated in the telegrams differed materially from the arrangements
which we had. made with Poland and Roumania.   these arrangements were &quot;based on the assumption that poland and Roumania would resist aggression with all their forces,   Paragraph 10 of the longer draft telegramand the general tenor of the shorter draft telegramwere based on the supposition that Germany mighttreat the document as an encirclement step and attackRussia through Poland and Roumania, in which event we might have to go to Russia?s assisstance, even thoughPoland or Roumania refrained from resisting theGerman invasion,,
     THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE thought that thiswas a most unlikely contingency.     THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that Roumania was more likely to acquiesce in a German invasion than Poland,which would almost certainly put up a strenuous resistance.     THE HOME SECRETARY enquired whether we had anyconfirmation of M. Maisky&apos;c statement &quot;that the Roumanianshad now given the Russians to understand that they wouldnot really mind what sort of an agreement was concludedbetween Prance, England&apos; and Russia&quot;.     SIR ALEXANDER CADOGAN said that we had. no definite information.   There was, however, no reason to suppose thatthe Roumanian view, namely, that Roumania did not wish to be tied up with Russia, had in any way been altered.     THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE suggested thatthe difficulty might be overcome by altering the wording of paragraph 2*                         ,    &apos; THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that paragraph 2 shouldbe altogether omitted.    &apos; THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE thought thatthe objection to omitting paragraph 2 was that we should then lose the assistance of Russia if we wex&apos;e engaged in awar in Western Europe or in the Mediterranean.     THE PRIME MINISTER thought that we could afford to forego Russian help in a war limited to the Mediterranean.As regards a war in Western Europe he agreed that theposition was much more difficult, but as against the militaryadvantages of Russian assistance must be weighed thepolitical objections,,     THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE agreed that from the purely military point of view there were arguments for and against.   On the one hand, there was no doubt that                    -  -11-
the possibility of war with Russia was a great deterrent to Germany who greatly feared having to conduct a  war  bothon the East and on the West.   On the other hand,  russia was not a great military power and her military effort ina European &quot;war was more likely to be disappointing thanotherwise.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that anything of the  natureof an alliance with Russia would give rise to serious difficulties with certain of the Dominions.   He repeatedhis suggestion  of the  omission of paragraph 2.     THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE asked whether ifparagraph 2 was omitted there would be in fact any differ-ence between our present proposals and those which russia had rejected,     THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the new proposals might provide a basis of settlement,   In Sir robert vansittart&apos;s note of his conversation with K. Maisky, sir robert had summed up the position as follows.-     &quot;The net result upon my mind of this prolonged talkis that we now have a very fair chance of concluding withRussia on the basis (a) of the exclusion of the baltic states, hut (b) - and this is a sine Qua non - of the offer of military conversations as drafted in paragraph 3alternative (b) of our shorter telegram to Moscow.&quot;     THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE pointed out thatin the conversation M. Maisky had never wavered, from hisdemand for a three-power pact.     THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS doubted whether in the end Russia would insist on this point andin this connection drew attention to the concluding paper of Sir Robert vansittart&apos;s note:-
                                                   *) n s                                                   5 W M     &quot;The key to all this is the elimination of theBaltic States in return for immediate practicalconversations.   But they will have to be immediate(paragraph 11, alternative (b) of our longer telegram)or we shall relapse into an immediate and highly dangerous deadlock.   Prom this deadlock Geneva willoffer no exit whatever, and the most dangerous playwill be made of it in every quarter, particularly inGermany.&quot;     THE PRIME MINISTER thought that M. Maisky mighthave argued that in the event of Great Britain, france and  Russia becoming involved in war owing to german aggression against Poland or Roumania, Germany might,  on reaching the Russian frontier, have said that but forthis declaration she would have stopped at the frontier,but as Russia had signed the declaration she (Germany)must take the Ukraine from her.     THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER suggestedthat the agreement should take the form of the first paragraph and paragraph 3 alternative (a).     THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP TRADE pointed out thatthis was what Russia had already rejected.     THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the proposal would satisfy neither Russia nor the Chiefs of Staff.     THE PRIME MINISTER wondered whether it might not inthe long.run satisfy M. Maisky.     THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER recalled thewarnings which we had had from Colonel Beck and M. Gafencuto the effect that a pact with Russia was likely in itselfto start a European war.   He agreed entirely with thestatement of paragraph 4 of the longer telegram that &quot;His
                                                  Y YIMajesty&apos;s Government fear that by accepting a directguarantee from the Soviet Union with this obviousimplication they would place Poland and Roumania inan embarrassing position which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfs own proposals are expressly designed to avoid&quot;,and he (Mr. Morrison) would add. &quot;might result in driving&quot;-p^-AJG^&apos;^NH ^^^rri^ i^ + n the Gernnn &quot;nrnp&quot;&apos; .  ^Jzr^ -     THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat it had been suggested that our new proposalswent no further than our previous proposals.   Thiswas not the case, as would be seen by comparison of telegram No. 97 to Moscow and the draft telegrams nowunder consideration.    In particulars the offer inparagraph 3 s alternative (b) of Staff Conversationswas a very important advance on our part.     THE PRESIDENT OB&apos; THE BOARD OF TRADE thought thatthe new proposals differed from the old mainly inmatters of wordings   It was not on the question ofStaff Conversations that M. Mo.lo.toff had returnedto the.charge,     THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER thought that ifparagraph 2 was amended as the Minister for Go-ordina-tion of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff desired itwould mean that v/e entered into a full-blown military alliance with Russia,   The alternative proposal wasthat if so desired by Poland or Roumania Russia shouldmake a declaration in favour of those countries, theeffect of which would be that,in the event of german aggression against Poland or Roumania, Great Britain,.France and Russia would be involved in war, andmoreover if by making this declaration Russia was
                                                  o v  )vindictively attacked by Germany we would come toRussia&apos;s assistance.     TRE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE thoughtthat in effect the arrangements now contemplatedconstituted a triple alliance between Russia, Franceand ourselves.   As, however, the text was draftedwe should not get full advantage from the alliance.The intention of Clause 2 seemed to be to limit our commitments to Russia to cases of German aggression against Poland and Roumania, and it seemed to theChiefs of Staff and himself that if the arrangements in paragraph 2 were honestly carried out Russia nodoubt would come  :\:o.to a war in Eastern Europe and weshould also come  into such a war if Poland or Roumaniawas attacked, but that if the war was limited to theWest we could look to little or no assistance fromRussia.   In this connection, Lord Chatfield drew attention to the weak strategical position of poland and the unlikelihood of Poland being able to put up anyserious resistance to a German invasion.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that this advice differed from the advice previously given, which was to theeffect that for some weeks at least Poland would beable successfully to resist German attacks.   Afterlistening to the discussion he felt that the best coursewould he to omit Clause 2.   He was alarmed at theviews of the Chiefs of Staff in favour of greatlyincreasing our liabilities (and by so doing increasingthe probability of war) and not at the same timeincreasing our assets.
        THE! MINISTER FOR COORDINATION OF! DEFENCE felt bound  to stress the point of view of the Chiefs of Staff.       In the event of a war in the west , in which russia remained neutral, Russia would  be left in  adominant position  at the end of hostilities.   In orderto avoid this very real danger It  would be better togo somewhat further than was now proposed so as toensure Russian participation in a  Western war.    issues of great strategical importance were involved, and hiscolleagues would realise how distasteful it was to him personally to eortenpiate ar. alliance with the Soviet.The views of the Chiefs of Staff were  in. the maininfluenced by the  deterrent effect  on  Germany of  thepossibility of Russian participation in  a European war.It was not possible to say that that, great country stand-ing behind Poland  would have no military or economic value, but on the  other hand considerations such  as Russia&apos;sbad communications-, the change of ite railway gauge at thePolish Frontier, and the weakness of the Russian high command, must riot  be lost sight of.  He  agreed that ifHay ^making- an alliance with Russia  we drove Poland and* ^Beaaaiarga-a: into the  German camp we should have made a mistake of vital and far-reaching  importance,       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  FOREIGN AFFAIRSenquired whether it might not be possible to make some progress by ascertaining &quot;whether,  as drafted, paragraph2 would be workable in practice..    His own view was thatthe paragraph would not be workable.   There was, he felt, considerable force in the criticism that theGermans would not, be so foolish as  to base an act of aggression on this paragraph,       SIR WILLIAM MALKIN explained to the Committee  thatin certain events  it would be for  Russia to decide whether or not she was bound under  the paragraph  to goto war.  This would be unsatisfactory.
       THE SECRETARf OP STATE POP FOREIGN AFFAIRS agreed with the Prime Minister that the hest course would &quot;be  to omit paragraph 2 altogether from the shorter draft Telegram.       THE HOME SECRETARY agreed with this proposal hutthought that if it was adopted the Telegram should herevised so as to avoid any suggestion that it was merelya restatement of our former proposals.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS read tothe Committee the latter part of Sir R.  Vansittart&apos;s Notecontaining Sir Robert&apos;s suggestions for the redrafting ofthe Telegram,not in substance,but in emphasis and presentation.       THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recalled theRussian arguments about reciprocity.   Russia&apos;s case wasthat she wanted us to be obliged to come to her assistance if she was attacked in Europe,and under the shorterTelegram,as now drafted, an affirmative answer could begiven provided that the attack on Russia was within thescope or arose out of the proposed declaration.       THE PRIMS MINISTER pointed out that Russia couldonly be attacked by Germany through Poland, Roumania orthe Baltic States.   He wished to limit our commitments to attacks through Poland and Roumania as being the onlycases which need be seriously considered,   For thereasons given in paragraph 6 of the Chiefs of Staff reports serious invasion of Russia by Germany through the baltic states could be ruled out.       Rather than consent to a Triple Alliance to includeRussia he, the Prime Minister, would prefer to extend ourguarantee against aggression to the Baltic States though this was a proposition on which he would like to have time to reflect..
       THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said    the that/four Baltic States did not want to receive a guaranteefrom Russia.     Finland, indeed,  was unwilling to heguaranteed by any other country.    Both Poland and roumania objected to being tied up with Russia.       THE HOME SECRETARY observed that in any case allthe four Baltic countries in question were extremely weak.       THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thathe favoured the more limited agreement because he was satisfied that &quot;by entering into it we should run much lessrisk of getting involved in an ideological war than if we entered into a formal military alliance with Russia.On these grounds it would be better to maintain our policyand limit our commitments to the strengthening and encouraging of Poland and Roumania.       THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that after some five weeks of negotiation we seemed to have reachedthe position when we must choose between a Three PowerPact or no arrangement of any kind with Russia.  He could see nothing in M. Molotoff&apos;s reply or in the Vansittart-Maisky conversation to justify the supposition that russia would be prepared to make a limited agreement such as was now proposed.  To send a reply to Moscow which containedno reference to the matters mentioned in paragraph 2 would,in his opinion, only result in another rebuff, and he doubted whether the negotiations with Russia could standanother rebuff.       THE HOME SECRETARY thought that the determining factor in regard to the policy to be pursued should bewhat line would be most likely to deter Germany from war.It had been argued that by greatly strengthening the
common front against aggression,  and in particular &quot;by-including Russia in that front,  that the risk of war would he greatly increased.   He himself had at one timeheld this view, but he did not hold it now.    The Chiefsof Staff had laid great stress on the deterrent effecton Germany of the possibility of Russia:  entering a european war.  He felt that there was great force inthis consideration and that we should bis wise to re-insure by doing everything in our power to bring Russia       THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO doubted whether we need at the moment contemplate a breakdown in thenegotiations with Russia.this connection that it was significant that neither Mr.Molotoff or M. Potemkin was going to Geneva, but thatM. Maisky was being sent there.  This did not look as though the Soviet Government thought that an agreement on the basis of our proposals could be reached.       THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that if wehad been faced with the alternatives of a full-blownalliance with Russia or with the breakdown of thenegotiations he would, without any hesitation, havefavoured a full-blown alliance.   We had not, however,reached this point, and the Prime Minister was not atpresent convinced that it would be impossible to secure a more limited arrangement on the basis of our present proposals.  In these circumstances he (Dr.  Burgin) saw no reason why we should not make a further attempt toobtain our desiderata.       THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE thought thatthe political consequences at home and abroad of aTHE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE thought in
*1 A 9e) i. sJfurther rejection by Russia of our proposals would hemost damaging and unfortunate.       THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS said that the continuance of thenegotiations would give us an opportunity of making clear to the world what our policy in Eastern Europe really was,namely, that it was not a policy based on ideologicalconsiderations or on taking sides, but on the strengthen-ing of the weaker elements in the front against aggress-ion.   The more the problem was discussed, the moreopportunities there would be for us to make our position clear.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he felt the greatest possible reluctance to beingbluffed off a sound and good policy by Russian insistence.Without asking the Committee finally to make up their minds, he favoured the offer of Staff Conversations so asto see whether Russia might not be persuaded to      into line with us.   He did not, of course, know what viewSir Robert Vansittart would take about the proposedomission of paragraph 2 of the shorter draft telegram.       In the course of discussion emphasis was laid onthe necessity for avoiding further delays  and of speedingup the conclusion of the negotiations, and in thisconnection it was pointed out that the conclusion of a pact such as the Russians desired would necessitateprolonged negotiations with Poland, Roumania and theBaltic States,  even if, as at present seemed very unlikely,  such negotiations were successful.       THE PRIME- MINISTER indicated that having regard toconsiderations  of this kind progress  might be bestfacilitated by  personal conversations.
        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS suggested &quot;that the &quot;best plan might be that Sir Robert &quot;Vansittart should see M0 Maisky again and should  say that he had been thinking over their talk.  He might ask M.  Maisky whether he thought that a settlement could be reached on the lines that (a)  we saw  objec- tion to including the four Baltic States within the scope of the proposed arrangements,  but (b) we undertook to institute Staff Conversations,,    If M.  Maisky raised the objection that  Russia preferred a  simpler form of direct guarantee from this country,  Sir Robert Vansittart might reply by referring to the objections which Poland and Roumania would raise to this course;,  and indicate that  it was  clear that the negotiation  of a settle- ment  on these lines would take considerable time; and that from the general political point  of view it was desirable that an agreement should be reached  as quickly as possible *    He might also  use the argument that  Russia  would be  well-advised to  &quot;be satisfied with  our proposal for mutual support  and assistance if  hostilities should result from the declarationsmade  by the  United  Kingdom,  France and  the U.SoS.R*        THE PRIME  MINISTER agreed  and  said that he had thought that  Sir  Robert Vansittart might  suggest to  M. Maisky  that  it would  be  in Russia5 s interests to make an agreement  on  the  lines now proposed,without prejudice to  tte possibility that  a closer formof agreement might  prove  possible at a  later date.        In  discussion  of  this  suggestion THE MINISTERFOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE  said that  if  an agree-ment was  to be recked between England, France and russia as  to the forms and extent of assistance
                                                D JL J to be  rendered materially  to  each  other  (See paragraph 3 (3)  of Telegram No0 93 from Russia), he thought there  was  a  good deal to be said for going furthero       THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD  OF TRADE said that, under  the  arrangement proposed, it was postulated that Germany and  Italy would be at war  with France, Great Britain and  Poland, and it was proposed  to work out the assistance which Russia could give usa   If war broke out as the result  of an aggression by  Germany on Poland, we should receive assistance from Russia;  but if war started in the West we should not be entitled to this help. He thought that such a result would be difficult to defendo       THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO thought that a talk between Sir Robert Vansittart. and Mo Maisky on the lines indicated was the right course0       THE PRIMS MINISTER said that he agreed with this view0       THE HOME SECRETARY suggested that emphasis should be laid on the need for reaching an agreement at an early  date.?       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS asked how much information should be given to the Dominion High Commissioners on this matter? and it was 1 agreed that the present position of the negotiations should be  explained frankly to the Dominion representatives.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS aaid that Mr0 Bruce, whom he had recently seen, had indicated considerable disinclination to reaching a close agreementwith Russia, but had hinted that in difficult circumstances such feelings might have to be disregarded.He gathered that Mrt,&apos; Bruce was prepared to go to considerable lengths to secure Russian adherence.
The Committee agreed - (l)  That the Secretary of State for Foreign       Affairs should invite Sir Robert Vansittart       to have a further talk with Mb Maisky, on       the lines indicated at &quot;A&quot; o   In effect,  this       amounted to discussion on the lines of       the shorter two draft telegrams to       Sir William Seeds, omitting paragraph 2       and including alternative (b) of       paragraph 5; (2)  To authorise the Secretary of State for       Dominion Affairs to inform the Dominion       High Commissioners of the present state       of the negotiations: (3)  That a further Meeting of the Committee       should be held as soon as Sir Robert       Vansittart had reported the result of       his further conversation with Mo Maisky.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.5    16th May, 1939.
               APPENDIX  I.Secretary of State,       I had lunch with LI. LJaisky today,   I will try toreduce a two-hour conversation to its simplest proportions.       He&apos; began by saying&apos;  that we had now reached a position where the British Government had to make up its mind, andby making up its mind he- indicated&apos;very clearly that hemeant a full pact to include the Baltic States.   I pickedhim up about the Baltic States and explained to him thatthey did not want to be included in a guarantee to includeRussia,   Li, Laisky said his information was somewhat different.   I replied that that was perhaps natural, butthe fact remained.   He retorted that the Roumanians had now given the Russians to  understand that they would not really mind what- sort of an agreement we concluded betweenPrance, England and Russia.   I replied that whether that were completely accurate or not, it would on: his own showinghave takes! the Roumanians  a full month to get there, count-ing from the time when the conclusion of pacts originallybegan.   to endeavour to bring in  the Baltic States would on any showing take even longer even if it were successful,which at present seemed unlikely.   I pointed out thatLi. ha is Icy himself had lust said that speed was now the essence of the business and that he&apos;, Liaisky, hoped thatdecision would not bo deferred till Geneva, where the only result would be that he, Liaisky, would again be seeingLord Halifax, since LV. Potemkin was not going to Geneva.The surest way to delay and complicate natters was toendeavour to bring in the  Baltic States, anyhow at thisstage.   I said it might well be that in the event ofGermany really attempting  to attack Soviet Russia throughthe Baltic States the attitude of  those States might change over-night.   But we had to deal with things as
they were now.   Moreover, I did not think that aGerman attack on Soviet Russia via the Baltic Statesonly was in the least likely.   The front would hefar too narrow for any effective result.    Ho German attackon Soviet Russia was conceivable except by the broaderfront of Poland and Roumania, and it was  on that that wehad better concentrate now.       M.  aisky was somewhat impressed by these arguments,and on further pressure he said that it was possible that a conclusion might be reached which would leave out thequestion of the Baltic States but which must in any caseinclude military conversations to decide  how assistance would in fact be given on the more restricted but more practical basis of attacks via Poland and Roumania.   having in mind what was already contemplated in  our draft telegram to Moscow, I said that this seemed to me  to be taking amore practical view of the problem and that I would turnover in my mind the stage reached by our  conversationat the point at which we left it.     /&quot;The net result u; on my mind of this prolonged talk isthat we now have a very fair chance of concluding withRussia on the basis (a) of the exclusion  of the baltic states, but (b) - and this is a sine qua  non - of theoffer of military conversations as drafted in parapgraph 3alternative (b) of our shorter telegram to LoscoWaJ?  On thebasis of a deal of this kind it would be  of no use whateverto think of the alternative and weaker version.   Theprospect of a conclusion would turn into  the certainty of a deadlock if the weaker alternative to paragraph 3VI/ere included in our telegram to ..oscow.       I would therefore suggest that this long and notunhopeful conversation entails a redrafting of our telegram to Moscow, not in substance but in emphasis and presentation?
                                                         *) X JI would suggest that the sequence ;should run somewhat asfollows:     (1) ./e should &quot;begin by  explaining why the Baltic Statesiviust be omitted.   This would be clone on the lines sketchedabove .     (2) .7e should then say  that the Soviet desideratum of consultation for translating the agreement into action if need be seems to us a reasonable point which we propose tocover, as in paragraph 6, alternative (b), of our shortertelegram to Loscow, on the basis of the more restricted field,1. e. aggression via Poland or lioumania.     I suggest this redrafting in order to get (a) the elimination that we desire,  (b) the practical consultationsthat the Soviet desire, into the&quot; forefront of the picture.For this purpose it would be necessary to discard at onceparagraph &quot;5, alternative (a), of the shorter telegram whichwill certainly not enable us to close the deal.     (S)  we should continue  that we agree with the SovietGovernment that a very, early conclusion OF our negotiations is essential in order TO produce the desired effect, and thatfor the reasons given under  (l) the jprocedure that we indicateis the only way of achieving this,     (4) iie would then GO on to,say that there is anotherpoint in the Soviet reply to which we kavs given much thought,and where we are also anxious to meet them.   ./O should thendeal with the question of &quot;reciprocity&quot; on the lines of paragraphs 1 - 4 of the longer telegram to Loscow (making thenecessary omission where a point had already been covered) andpoint to paragraphs 1 and 2  of the shorter telsgram to Lioscow.Paragraph 5 of the longer telegram will already nave been covered by transposition to paragraph 1 of our new draft inthe light of this conversation.

Promthis deadlock Geneva will offer no exit whatever, ana themost dangerous play will be made of it in every quarter,particularly in Germanj^./16th May, 1959
9 9 -fAPPENDIXII          NEGOTIATIONS WITH TEE SOVIET.                 AIDE-MEMOIRE.General Considerations.1*     The strategical and. political aspects  are closely related in a problem of this kind.    Prom  the broad point of view, it is felt that a full-blownguarantee of mutual assistance between Great  Britainand Prance and the Soviet Union offers certain advantages.   It would present a solid front  of formidableproportions against aggression and, provided  the guaranteeapplied only to Europe, there should be little danger ofantagonising Japan.   The attitude of other Powers isalso of great importance and, in particular,  that  ofSpainc   The Chiefs of Staff have already expressed theirviews as to the strategical importance of avoiding a hostile Spain...   It is for consideration, however&apos;, whethera full-blown undertaking with the Soviet would have amore unfavourable influence on General Franco&apos;s attitudethan a somewhat similar undertaking in a less definiteform.   The whole-hearted accession of Russia to the anti-aggression cause might influence certain wavererstowards our side02.     If we fail to achieve any agreement with the Sovietit might be regarded as a diplomatic defeat which wouldhave serious military repercussions., in that it would havethe immediate effect of encouraging Germany to further
                                                  t* f-j &amp;acts of aggression and of ultimately throwingthe U. S. S.R. into her arms.   Even if this didnot occur, we certainly want something betterthan the bare neutrality of Russia, not only from the point of view of being able to drawon her resources, but also to enable assistanceto be rendered to Poland and Roumania.   Furthermore,if Russia remained neutral, it would leave her ina dominating position at the&apos; end of hostilities.3.     We now turn to the specific questionsaddressed to us by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence.4.     The Chiefs of Staff have been ashed whetherit is important, from the military point of view,that the Baltic States should not be occupied byGermany.   Speaking generally, any further expansionof Germany would have serious repercussions, not onlyall over Europe but &quot;throughout the worlds   From themilitary point of view it is also most undesirableby reason of the fact that German action of thiskind would complete the encirclement of Poland on three sides, bring Germany within close range ofLeningrad, and turn the Baltic into a German lake.5.     nevertheless, the Chiefs of Staff considerthat the military disadvantages of a german occupation of the Baltic States are not so grave asto justify us in going to war, unless it was certainthat the whole of the Eastern front of Europe,particularly Poland and Russia, would also activelyintervene;  in other words, unless we could be certain of making it a two-front war for Germany.
                                                     9  9                                                     ** 6 (J6.     A German attack in force on Russia either by sea, or via-, the Baltic States without violatingthe integrity of Poland is an operation that isfraught with tremendous difficulties,  owing to poorcommunications,  vast distances, and the unsuitabilityof East Prussia as a base from which to launch such operations.   The Chiefs of Staff consider that the chances of Germany attempting an invasion of Russiathrough the Baltic States are remote,  and the chances of her being successful even more so.    In thesecircumstances the Chiefs of Staff consider that weshould be running little risk by guaranteeing Russianterritory in Europe against attack.   Prom themilitary point of view therefore the Chiefs of Staffthink that we should gain more than we should loseby giving a guarantee of this kind to Russia, in returnfor an undertaking by Russia to come to our assistance if we became involved in war with Germany.7.     The Russian suggestion that we should guarantee the States of Central and Eastern Europe includingLatvia, Estonia and Finland is quite another matter.It is quite conceivable that Germany might occupy firstLithuania, and then Latvia^  and that the U.S.S.R.would content themselves by declaring war on Germany,without making any move be2rond her own frontiers,.   Inthese circumstances we should, if we had guaranteed theBaltic States, find ourselves in the following position.Poland would not be in the war:  Russia would be merelystanding on the defensive on her own frontier:  andFrance and Great Britain would have to bear the wholebrunt of the German attack without any of the advantages to be derived from a two front wax&quot;.   The Chiefs of Stafftherefore consider that from a strictly military pointof view, we should refuse to guarantee any of theBaltic States,
                                                  v) (a !18.     Me,have examined the question of the balance ofstrategical value in war as between Spain as an enemy and Russia as an ally.   This question was referred to us at very short notice on the 10th hay and we answered it within a few hours (Paper No. CCS. 90S).   Talcing intoaccount the following facts:-       (i) The war weariness of Spain and their             present lack of political stability:      (ii) The fact that negotiations., with Russia  have             already proceeded a long way:     (iii) The importance of establishing a solid             Eastern European Front:we now incline to the view that the possibility ofantagonising Franco Spain should not from the military point of view be allowed to stand in the way of theconclusion of a pact with Russia.
