217THIS&quot; DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS MAJESTY1 S BRITANNIC GOVERNMENT.            CABINET.         AGRICULTURAL POLICY.       OATS,  BARLEY AND SHEEP.         MEiaORAfllDUM BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AM) fisheries and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND     1.   Our colleagues will be aware that, following on adecision of the Cacinet Committee on Agricultural Policy onDecember 21st, 1938, (A.P. (37) 8th Mtg.) the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries made an announcement in the House ofCommons on the 22nd December, 1938,  in the following terms:-          &quot;The Government fully recognise the deep     concern that is being felt at the present time about     some aspects of the agricultural situation and share it.     They are undertaking a review of the situation and     they have before them in that connection the considered     views which have been expressed by responsible agricultural     bodies including the statements issued by the National     Farmers&apos; Union of England and Wales and the National     Farmers&apos; Union and Chamber of Agriculture of Scotland....&quot;     2.   The review referred to in this statement has been undertaken during the past few months by an Inter-DepartmentalCommittee of officials and an interim report was submitted to theCabinet Committee on Agricultural Policy on the 27th January, 1939,(A.P.(37)(17) primarily for the purpose of preparing the way for discussions between Agricultural Ministers and the NationalFarmers1 unions.   This interim report was accepted by theCabinet Committee on the 30th January, 1939, (A.P.(37)9th Mtg.)and discussions with the Unions have since taken place.Sufficient progress has now been made to enable us to submit, forthe approval of our colleagues, definite proposals with regard tocertain agricultural commodities which are considered to be those most in need of immediate help.

General Principles     3.   The stat ement. issued by the National Farmers&apos;  Unionof England and Wales recommended the adoption of two main principles as a basis of a long-term agricultural programme,-namely : -     (l) The adoption of price insurance plans to operate           wherever unduly low price levels are shown to           exist.     (2) The enforcement of effective regulation of food           imports from overseas countries pending the           operation of commodity councils on the lines           agreed by the Empire Producers&apos; Conference at           Sydney.     4.   A somewhat different approach to the problem wasmade by the National Farmers&apos; Union and Chamber of agriculture for Scotland in their statement on agricultural policy.  Inparticular they pressed that price insurance should be at a levelsufficient to cover costs of production,     5.   So far as the second of the above points is concerned,the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in a statement in theHouse on the 13th July, 1938, said that the Governmentapproved the general principle of regulating supplies by meansof commodity councils.   The initiative for setting up suchcouncils must, however, rest with producers themselves.  Itwas also made clear in that statement that it was the intentionof the Government, failing unanimity in a council dealing withany appropriate commodity in which this country had an interest at producers, to ask the House for powers to regulate importsif the Government did not already possess such powers.   Withregard to the N.F.U. suggestion that the Government should themselves regulate food imports in anticipation of the settingup of commodity councils, we are of opinion that the position
is adequately covered by the statement made on 13th July last,especially having regard to the action which has since beentaken in regard to the control of imports of mutton and lamb,and the encouragement which is being given to the efforts topromote the establishment of a commodity council for processedmilk.     6.   The. first difficulty which confronted us in our discussions with the T\i.F.U. s on the proposal for priceinsurance was to agree a suitable interpretation of that termwhich could be accepted both by them and by the Government.The Inter-Departmental Committee gave very full considerationto this matter and recommended that the objective of priceinsurance should be to safeguard the producer against lossessuch as would, if continued, seriously jeopardise his economic -position, and would prejudice the- maintenance of the productivity and fertility of the soil.    This recommendation was accepted inprinciple by the Agricultural Policy Committee and discussions with the Unions have been conducted throughout with this interpretation in mind.   It cannot be said, however, that agreement has been reached, and we feel we must warn our colleagues that the farmers&apos; representatives&apos; conception of price insurance leads them to expect a higher level of guaranteed prices than would be compatible with the inter-pretation of this term to which we have referred above.     7.   The second point of difference between the N.F.U.Sand the Agricultural Ministers lay in the extent and theapplication of price insurance.   It was made very clear inthe Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s interim report that it wouldbe impossible for the Government to agree that price insurance should be adopted as a universal panacea for all agricultural commodities.   Each commodity must be considered separatelyand if it is decided that assistance is necessary the method
to r\to be adopted should be that which the Government feel inall the circumstances is most appropriate to that particularcommodity.   This view was placed before the Unions and itwas suggested to them on the basis of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee^ report that the principal agricultural commodities in commercial production at the present time might be dividedinto two  categories,  namely -     (l) those which may be regarded as the staple products           of our agricultural system, that is to say,           products on the continued production of which the           cultivation and fertility of the land mainly           dependsj  this class would comprise dairy cattle,           beef cattle, sheep, cereals, potatoes and sugar beet     (2) those which are mainly carried on as specialised           forms of production and do not to the same extent           form part of a system of general mixed farming.     8.   It was further suggested to them that v/hile priceinsurance might be suitable for those commodities falling within the first category, such a method of assistance was neither necessary nor desirable for products included in thesecond group.  The Unions were prepared to accept in principlethis suggested division for the purpose of the discussions, butthey contended that the possibility of dealing with other commodities should not be excluded.   They also felt that pigs and poultry should be included within the first group.   It wassuggested to them that these two products were in any caseadequately covered by measures of assistance in existence or in contemplation, and while they did not forego their contention,they agreed that the question of the classification of pigs and poultry was not of immediate practical importance.     9.   The Inter-Departmental Committee expressed the view,and the Agricultural Policy Committee concurred, that as far
2as the other commodities in&apos;group (l) are concerned, no  furtherlegislative measures were required for beef cattle, wheat,potatoes and sugar beet.  wheat and cattle  are already thesubject of measures of  assistance which partake of thecharacter of price insurance, while sugar beet is  providedfor by special arrangements which it is not necessary or desirable to alter.  The existing machinery for potatoes,which includes regulation of sales by an Agricultural MarketingBoard in conjunction with the regulation of imports by theBoard of irade, has operated very successfully and is also felt to be adequate.   with the elimination of these products thescope for the practical application of price insurance methodsis reduced to four commodities, namely, oats, barley, sheep and milk products.  Uhile the Unions were not prepared toagree that a. further measure of assistance was unnecessaryfor those products which it was suggested to them were alreadyadequately  covered, they recognised that it was necessary asa matter of practical importance to confine attention, forthe purpose of legislation this Session to the four1 commoditiesmentioned above.  As a  result of the detailed consideration which has now been given to these four products, we are in aposition to submit for.  the approval of our  colleagues the under the Agriculture Act, 1957,  is  in  the nature  of  a deficiency payment confined to  growers  who do not  take wheat deficiency payments and based on  a standard price  of  8/- percwt. related to a notional yield  of  5 cwts. per  acre.Oats10,   The present rate of assistance to growers of oatsThere is an over-riding maximum of  1 per acre.The averageyield per acre of oats in the United Kingdom is about
9 0?6 w ^16 cwts., so that on the  average,&apos;growers who do not takewheat deficiency payments  receive  subsidy in respect of6/l6ths of their crop.      11.  On February 23rd, 1939, the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries, with the approval of the Cabinet, (Cab. M in. 3 (39), Ooncl.8) madea statement on oats and barley which  included the following:-               &quot;As a result of this review  the Government          have reached the conclusion that  it is necessary          to give additional assistance to  barley and oats,          and they propose that when the long-term policy          has been finally settled, it should be applied          retrospectively, as far  as is practicable, to          both these cereals in respect of  the 1938 crops.          Although details of the  policy are still under          discussion, it is proposed in the forthcoming          long-term legislation &quot;to remove the restriction          contained in the Agriculture Act  under which the          receipt of deficiency payments for wheat renders          growers ineligible for subsidy in respect of          barley and oats, and to  provide that assistance          should, in principle, be available concurrently          for all three cereal crops.&quot;     12.  The following proposals  for oats  have subsequently been agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and our other colleagues on the Trade and Agriculture Committee of theCabinet:-     (i) The standard price to remain at 8/- per cwt.    (ii) Growers of oats who elect for wheat  deficiency payments           to receive subsidy based on a notional yield           of 6 cv/ts. per acre, subject to  a maximum payment           of  1 per acre.   (iii) Growers of oats who do not receive wheat deficiency           payments to receive subsidy based on a notional           production of 14 cwts.  per acre, subject to a           maximum payment of 4S/8d. per acre.    (iv) Subsidy to be paid in respect of a maximum qualifying           U.K. acreage of 2-g- million acres and to be reduced           proportionately (as in  the  ..heat Act, 1932, and           the Agriculture Act, 1937) if this acreage is           exceeded- the total acreage being divided for this           purpose among wheat growers and  others in the
(y/ hi *J          proportion 1,030,000 acres and 1,470,000 acres.          (the estimated acreages in 1938 including oats in          mixed corn, were 1,010,000 acres and 1,430,000 acres          respectively, totalling 2,440,000 acres).     13,  Under these proposals an additional sum of about 2,120,000 will become payable in respect of the 1938 oatscrop and the cost in future would be likely to average, onthe basis of prices in the past six years, about  1,500,000more annually that under the Agriculture Act Scheme.    Themaximum liability in any one year would be about  4,460,000as against an existing maximum liability of  1,470,000     Barley     14.  The preparation of a price insurance scheme forbarley has proved considerably more difficult than foroats, mainly owing to the dual use of barley for malting andfor feeding to livestock.   A number of discussions have takenplace both with the agricultural organisations and withbrewers, distillers and other interests, and the preparationof a scheme has reached an advanced stage.   We hope to beable to submit a scheme for the approval of our colleagues atan early date but in the meantime it is obvious that no scheme of the kind being discussed with the malt-usinginterests could be applied retrospectively to the  1938 crop,for which retrospective assistance was promised in thestatement on February 23rd quoted above.   It is proposed,therefore, that in respect of this crop growers of barleyshould receive assistance at the same rates and on the same terms as proposed above for oats,     15.  An additional sum of  800,000 will under thisproposal become payable in respect of the 1938 crop.
     Sheep                                                  go i                                                            6 fo. &apos;1     16.  For sheep a price insurance scheme based on thefollowing principles is proposed:-     (a) The scheme should provide for a deficiency payment            from the Exchequer on sheep presented for sale for            slaughter which exceed a certain qualifying            minimum weight.     (b) Lambs should be eligible for the  same rate of subsidy            as sheep provided they reach the qualifying minimum            weight.     (c) The deficiency payment  should be  calculated on a monthly            basis  and should be  the difference between a standard            price  for fat sheep, and an ascertained average            market price for all breeds of sheep, and should be            paid in respect of a standard weight;  that is to            say, a given amount  per head would be paid in respect            of all sheep of the  same class eligible for subsidy,            irrespective of their actual weights.     (d) There would., however, be two different classes of sheep            with different standard and qualifying weights            consisting of a lighter class  and a heavier class            which  should be defined by specifying the breeds            of sheep falling within each class.     (e) There should be some limit to the numbers Of sheep            receiving full rate  of subsidy.     17.  v/e propose that the monthly standard prices for sheepshould be such as will average 10 pence per lb. over the^yearand that this figure should be related to  a total she&apos;ep populationof 27 millions, a  figure which was nearly  attained in 1938 but has only been exceeded in 4 years since 1900-f  The arrangementcontemplated is that the annual  average^standard price should be&quot;stepped down&quot; in  relation to successive increases of 250,000in the total United Kingdom sheep^population.     18.  We have  agreed with^the Chancellor of the exchequer that when these proposals^are put before the House in legislativeform it should be  made/quite clear that if market prices remainpersistently below,/Che standard  price as a result of excessivehome supplies and&quot;  not of excessive imports, the scheme will haveto be reviewed.  V/e should add,  in this connection, that it isproposed^to fix the standard weights so as to encourage theprodpcabion of the  lighter sheep  and smaller joints which consumersj^e^now demanding     19.  The Exchequer liability under these proposals wouldvary considerably  from year to year with the price of sheep, buton the basis of the past 6 years would have averaged  880,000annually.                     0                              o.

In view of the withdrawal of the Milk Industry Bill,special legislation will he necessary before Parliament  risesfor the summer recess to recoup the Milk Boards for thepayments which they have made to producers in anticipation of legislation and to provide for assistance to the industry during the contract year 1st October,1939 - 30th September,1940.   A measure of price insurance for milk, manufacturedinto butter and cheese will be a necessary part of this legislation and can he more conveniently considered at a later stage in that connection.   These proposals should in ourview be sufficient for the time being to cover the case  of milk -products, since as regards the remaining milk products,i.e. condensed milk and milk powder, arrangements are well advanced for the regulation of imports, either through the medium of a commodity council, or by Order under theAgricultural Marketing Act, 1933.   The institution of effective control should enable a price agreement betweenhome and overseas interests to be established and maintained and if this result can be achieved it is hoped that there wouldbe no occasion for an Exchequer rjrice insurance scheme forproducts other than butter and cheese.     21.  Consideration has also been given to certain proposals of a more general nature which have been putforward by the N.F.TJ.S and the Landowners&apos; Associations  ofEngland and Wales and Scotland.   The latter bodies laid stress on the importance of associating with any measures ofassistance to cereal growers conditions which would ensurethat the fertility of the land was not being impaired bybad cultivation and in particular by overcropping withwhite stray/ crops.   It is proposed to include in thelegislation provisions on the lines of Section 8 of the agriculture Act, 1937, somewhat. strengthened, which will enable ministers to withhold oats or barley subsidy in cases of
hj (-J 0negligent cultivation or harmful cropping practices.   22.    A proposal to which &quot;both N.P.U.s attached great&apos;importance was that an independent body should be set up? onthe lines of the Import Duties Advisory Committee, &quot;whose solefunction it would be to recommend the initial price levelsat which the price insurance plans should begin to operate in the case of each commodity and such variations of these levels as might be deemed desirable from time to time in thelight of changing circumstances.&quot;   We have also given thisproposal full consideration? and have come to the conclusionthat the appointment of such a body would not be consistent with the views expressed in the earlier part of thismemorandum on the appropriate scope and nature of priceinsurance in relation to agricultural commodities.     Itwould in our view be a derogation from Ministerial responsibilityif the question whether price insurance should be applied toany particular commodities were to be remitted? even for examination? to an outside body.   Similarly the decision asto the appropriate rate of assistance from the Exchequer inrespect of any particular commodity is one which can only betaken by the Government in the light of all the circumstances?including considerations of national finance which could not possibly be examined and assessed by an outside advisory body.   The idea underlying the N.F.U. proposal is presumablythat the price level for each commodity should be based on thecost of production of that commodity? and that once theGovernment has agreed to accept this principle? the appropriateprice for each commodity becomes a question of fact to bedetermined by an independent body charged with the duty of ascertaining the facts.    But in fact it is proposed thatthe Government should not agree to the principle that standardprices even where appropriate ? should be based on costs
 of  production.    Prices  are to be fixed  at  such  a  level  as will  provide for  assistance to producers when price levels become unduly low.    Consequently, any scheme for  prompt adjustment of the standard price whenever there  is a change in  the cost of production is not appropriate.    23.   It is fully recognised that provision  will have to be  made for varying the  standard rate if a  material change takes place in circumstances;  but the machinery for effecting this change should, we consider,  be the normal provision giving  Ministers power, with the  approval of the Treasury, and subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in  Parliament,  to vary the rates by statutory order.    24.   7fe have every hope that, in conjunction with the important measures already taken by the Government for the assistance of home agriculture,  the proposals put forward inthis memorandum,   by dealing with the outstanding and urgent commodity problems, will go far towards restoring confidence in the industry.    It must be recognised, however,  that, inthe nature of things,  prices considered appropriate for price insurance purposes (&quot;price insurance&quot; being interpreted asproposed in this memorandum)  will not in themselves restoreprosperity to the industry or bring about a substantial change in those aspects of the agricultural problems whichattract so much public attention - in particular, the employment of labour.    The policy must be  considered and presented as a whole,  with the necessary emphasis on the improvement in price  levels which can be effected by-regulation of supplies,  and on the reduction in costs whichcan be effected by improved methods of production,  marketingand distribution.    There still remain therefore a number of problems of a more general character which have to  be tackled.The question of agricultural credit,  efficiency measures, andthe whole group of &quot;rural amenity&quot; problems (with which theworkers are particularly concerned)  are examples.   &quot;vYe shall                         11.

The legislation which will  he necessary  to  give   effect  to these proposals for oats, barley  and sheep,  if   they  are  approved, will afford  an  opportunity of seeking   the authority of parliament  for the grants  cf  2 per  acre   in respect  of ploughed-up grassland authorised by  the   Cabinet on  3rd May (Cabinet  26(39)) and announced  on  the   same  day.        26.  It  is important that  an  announcement of  the   Government&apos;s  intentions with regard to oats, barley and   sheep should be made at a very  early  date and we should be   glad  to have  the authority of^our  colleagues to a  statement   on the lines  of the draft attached to this memorandum.

J 0                    DRAFT AMOUNCjLIvlgiWT       PRICE INSURANCE FOR OATS,  BAitLEY AND SKBEP.           The general review of the agricultural situationwhich was initiated, earlier in the year, and the subsequent discussions with representatives of the farming industry andof other interests, have now reached the stage when theGovernment are in a position to announce the conclusions atwhich they have arrived in regard to the application of theprinciple of price-insurance to oats, barley and sheep.Oats.           On the 23rd February I announced that the Governmenthad reached the conclusion that the provisions of the agriculture Act, 1937, in respect of oats and barley were inadequate and that additional assistance was required bygrowers of these cereals.   The purposes for which these crops are frown are very different and it is accordingly consideredthat they merit separate treatment in future.   Under the agriculture Act, 1937, growers of oats who receive wheat deficiency payments are debarred from receiving oatssubsidy.   It is proposed that these growers should beentitled to receive oats subsidy based on 6 cwts. per acrewith a maximum payment of  1 per acre.   Growers of oats who do not receive wheat deficiency payments are entitled atpresent to receive oats subsidy based on 6 cwts. per acre.It is proposed that these growers should be entitled toreceive oats subsidy based on 14 cwts. per acre, with amaximum payment of  2.6.8d; per acre.   The standard pricewill be, as at present, 8/- per cwt. and deficiency payments will be calculated according to the difference between theaverage market price of oats in the United Kingdom during                           1.
                                                       230the seven months September-March, and this standard price.The average market price in the United Kingdom will bedetermined by weighing the average prices in England andWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, respectively, accordingto the acreages in each country qualifying for the higher rate of subsidy.          It is proposed that the maximum acreage in respectof which the full rate of subsidy will be applied should be2,500,000 acres, which will be divided as to 1,0303000 acres in respect of growers who take wheat deficiency payments and1*470,000 acres for non-wheat growers.          It is proposed that this additional assistance should be applied retrospectively to the 1938 crop, any payments received under the Agriculture Act, 1937, be ingtreated as advances.   The effect of these proposals inrespect of the 1938 crop will be that oat growers whoreceived wheat deficiency payments will, if Parliamentapproves, now receive a payment of 13/6 per acre.   Oatgrowers who grew no wheat or who chose not to receive wheat deficiency payments, will receive a payment of 18/4 per acrein addition to the payment of 13/2 which they have already received under the Agriculture Act, 1937.   Those farmerswho did not apply for oats subsidy during the prescribed period last year will be given a further opportunity of applying.Barley          The production of barley in the United Kingdom is designed in the main to meet the requirements of brewers,distillers and other users of barley for malting purposes,and these industries have expressed their willingness toaccept responsibility for ensuring to the grower a reasonable price for that part of his crop, the continued production ofwhich it is in their interest to&apos;maintain.    It is proposed
                                                        231that the risks attaching to the remainder should be insuredby the Exchequer&apos;.&apos;   Substantial progress has been made in thediscussions with the malt-using industries  which are stillproceedings and I have every hope that a satisfactory scheme will be evolved at a very early date.    it is proposed thatthe maximum quantity of barley qualifying for the full rateof assistance would be fixed at 18 million cwts. or, on thebasis of average yields the produce of 1,250,000 acres? after making an allswance of 10 per cent, for seed and waste.          It is clearj however, that no plan of the kindunder discussion with the malt-using industries could beapplied retrospectivelys and it is accordingly proposed that?in respect of the 1938 crops growers of barley shall receiveassistance at the same rates Nand on the sane terms as are proposed for growers of oats.          The effect of this proposal in respect of the1938 crop will be that barley growers who received wheat deficiency payments wills if Parliament approves, now receive a payment of 13/6dper acre.   Barley growers who grew nowheat, or who chose not to receive wheat deficiency payments will receive a payment of 20/8dper acre, in addition to thepayment of 10/10dper acre which they have already received under the Agriculture Acts 1937. .  As in the case of growersof oatss a further opportunity of applying for subsidy will begiven to th*se farmers who did not make application within theprescribed period.Sheep.          Sheep form an essential feature of the agriculturaleconomy of a large part of the country and past experience suggests the desirability of safeguarding the industry againstserious losses such as occurred in 1938.   The government accordinly propose to invite the Livestock Commission toprepare a scheme of price insurance which would provide a deficiency payment from the Exchequer on sheep  (excluding ewesand rams) which  are presented for  sale  for slaughter and
                                                         *) 0 9                                                           d  1exceed a &quot;prescribed qualifying minimum weight.    the deficiency payment would &quot;be calculated by reference to monthlystandard prices averaging lOd. per lb. over the year andmonthly average realised prices for all breeds of fat sheep.It is proposed that these deficiency payments should be madein respect of standard weights; that is to say, a given amountper head would be paid in respect of all sheep of the sameclass eligible for subsidy, irrespective of their actualv/eights.  There would, however, be two different classes ofsheep with different qualifying and standard weights,consisting of a lighter class and a heavier class.  It isproposed that the standard price of 10d.. per lb. should be related to a total United Kingdom sheep population of 27millions, and that provision  should be made for varying thestandard price in the event of the sheep population risingabove this ceiling.          The legislation necessary to give effect to theseproposals will be introduced  as soon as possible.
2^ *3          The following Draft Announcement on Sheep,  barley and Oats, which should be substituted, for that circulated withMemorandum CP. 110 (39), contains amendments consequentialupon the revision of Paragraphs 17 and 18 of that Memorandum,referred to above.   A reference to the proposed variation of standard prices by Ministerial Order, with the approval ofthe Treasury and subject to the affirmative resolution procedure (see Paragraph 23 of CP. 110 (39)) has also been added:-                      DRAFT&apos; ANNOUNCEMENT            PRICE 1KBURANCjE FOR SHE^PX-BARLEY AND OaTS.          The general review of the agricultural situationwhich was initiated earlier in the year, and the subsequent discussions with representatives of the farming industry andof other interests, have now reached the stage when theGovernment are in a position to announce the conclusions atwhich they have arrived in regard to the application of theprinciple of price-insurance to sheep, barley and oats.Sheep.          Sheep form an essential feature of the agriculturaleconomy of a large part of the country and past experience suggests the desirability of safeguarding the industryagainst serious losses such as occurred in 1938.   TheGovernment accordingly propose to invite the LivestockCommission to prepare a scheme of price insurance which wouldprovide a deficiency payment from the Exchequer on sheep(excluding ewes and rams) which are presented for sale forslaughter and exceed a prescribed qualifying minimum weight.It is proposed that these deficiency payments should be  madein respect of standard weights;  that Is to say, a givenamount per head would be paid in respect of all sheep of thesame class eligible for subsidy, irrespective of their actualweights.   There would, however, be two different classes ofsheep with different qualifying and standard weights, consistingof a lighter class and a heavier class.
9^ ;*6*j *           It  is  proposed  that  the monthly  standard  prices  for sheep  should  be  such as will  average  lOd.  per  lb. over  the year and  that this  figure should, be  related  to  a  total  sheep population of 27 millions,  subject to provision being made for -varying the  standard  price in the event  of  the  sheep population rising above this figure  or of  the  standard,  price being  in  excess  of  the market  price  for two  years in succession. To give effect to this provision it  is proposed that     (l)  The  standard price should he &quot;stepped  down&quot; by           -g-d.  in relation to successive increases of           250,000 in the  total  United Kingdom  sheep           population up to  a figure of 28  million and           by   d. for each successive  250,000 thereafter; and     (2)   If  the standard, price should he  for two            successive years in  excess;of the market price,            the standard price  would be scaled down.   The            adjusted scale would not however  come into operation,            even  if  the guaranteed price should  remain above the           market price for two successive years, if it could           be  shown that this  price position were the result            of excessive imports of mutton  and  lamb.Oats.           On  the 23rd February  I announced that the Government had. reached the  conclusion  that the  provisions  of the Agriculture Act, 1937, in respect of  oats  and barley were inadequate  and that  additional  assistance  was required  by growers of  these cereals.   The purposes for which  these crops are grown  are very  different and. it is accordingly  considered that they  merit  separate  treatment in future.   Under the agriculture Act, 1937, growers  of oats who receive  wheat deficiency  payments  are debarred, from receiving oats subsidy.    It is proposed that  these  growers should be entitled to receive  oats  subsidy based on  6 cwt. per acre                        .  2. 1 &quot;&apos;.              .  &apos;  &apos;
                                                       - f**                                                      H *iwith  a maximum payment of  1 per acre.   Growers of oats who do not receive wheat deficiency payments are entitled atpresent  to  receive  oats  subsidy based on 6 cwts. per acre.It is proposed that these growers should be entitled toreceive  oats  subsidy based on 14 cwts. per acre, with amaximum  payment of  2.6.8d. per acre.   The standard, pricewill  be,  as at present,  8/- per cwt. :?.nd deficiency payments will  be  calculated according to the difference betv/een theaverage  market price of  oats in the United Kingdom duringthe seven months September-March, and this standard price.The average market  price in the United. Kingdom will bedetermined by  weighting  the average prices in England andWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, respectively, accordingto the acreages in each  country qualifying for the higher rate  of  subsidy.          It  is proposed that the maximum acreage in respectof which the full rate of subsidy will be applied should be,500.000 acres, which will be divided as to 1,030,000 acres in respect of  growers who take wheat deficiency payments and1,470,000 acres for non-wheat growers.          It is proposed that this additional assistance should be applied retrospectively to the 1.933 crop, any payments  received under the Agriculture Act, 1937, be ingtreated,  as advances.   The effect of these proposals inrespect  of the 1938 crop will be that oat growers whoreceived  wheat deficiency payments will, if Parliamentapproves, now  receive a payment of 13/6 per acre.   Oatgrowers who grew no wheat or who chose not to receive wheat deficiency payments, will receive a payment of 18/4 per acrein addition to the &quot;Dayment of 13/2 which they have already received, under the Agriculture Act,  1937.  Those farmerswho did not apply for oats subsidy during the prescribed period last year will be given a further opportunity of applying.                       3.
                                  /                                                          rt ft  *Bar-ley.          The production of &quot;barley in the United Kingdom is designed in the main to meet the requirements of &quot;brewers?distillers and other users of barley for malting purposes?and these industries have expressed their willingness toaccept responsibility for ensuring to the grower a reasonable price for that part of his crop? the continued production ofwhich it is in their interest to maintain.   It is proposedthat the risks attaching to the remainder should be insuredby the Exchequer.   Substantial progress has been made in thediscussions with the malt-using industries? which are still proceeding? and I have every hope that a satisfactory scheme will be evolved at an early date.   It is proposed that themaximum quantity of barley qualifying for the full rate ofassistance would be fixed at 18 million cwts. which is? on thebasis of average yields? the produce of 1?250?000 acres? after making an allowance of 10 per cent, for seed and waste.          It is clear? however? that no plan of the kindunder discussion with the malt-using industries could beapplied retrospectively? and it is accordingly proposed  that?in respect of the 1938 crop? growers of barley shall receiveassistance at the same rates and on the same terms as are proposed for growers of oats.          The effect of this proposal in  respect of the1938 crop will be that barley growers who received wheat deficiency payments will? if Parliament approves? now receive a payment of 13/6d. per acre.   Barley growers who grew nowheat? or who chose not to receive wheat deficiency payments will receive a payment of 20/8d per acre? in addition to  thepayment of 10/10d per acre which they have already received under the Agriculture Act? 1937.   As in  the case of growersof oats? a further opportunity of applying for subsidy will begiven to those farmers who did not make application within  theprescribed period.
          Provision will be made for varying the standardprices referred to in this statement if there is a material change in conditions.    For this purpose it isproposed that Ministers should be given power, withthe approval of the Treasury, and subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in Parliament, to vary the standard prices by statutory order.          The legislation necessary to give effect to theseproposals will be introduced as soon as possible.
ej fj O          The follov^ing&quot; paragraphs, which should be substitutedfor paragraphs 17 and 18 of CP. 110(39) - Memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary ofState for Scotland on Oats, Barley and Sheep - set out inmore precise terms the agreement which has been reached withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer on the procedure for modifying the standard price for sheep:-     17.    We have agreed with the Chancellor of the  Exchequer that the monthly standard prices for sheep should  be such as will average lOd. per lb. over the yea,r and that  this figure should be related to a total sheep population  of 27 millions, a figure which was nearly attained in 1938  but has only been exceeded in four years since 1900.  It is also agreed that       (l) The standard price should be &quot;stepped down1&apos;           by -g-d. in relation to successive increases of           250,000 in the total United Kingdom sheep           population up to a figure of 28 million and by           - d. for each successive 250,000 thereafter; and       (2) If the guaranteed price should be for two           successive years in  excess of the market price,           the relationship between the sheep population           and standard price would be modified so that a           given level of  sheep population would attract           a lower  standard price.  The basic scale would           however be reinstated in the event of the market           price subsequently being for two successive years           in excess of the standard price.
          The effect of this scheme  can he  seen from  thefollowing table: -                                   Standard price                                            Adjusted  scale Sheep population                           to operate  if on 4th June of                             standard  price previous year.       Basic scale.           is above  market                                            price for two                                            successive  years,Hot exceeding:             d.                       d.   27 millions            10                        9-g   28    &quot;                 9^                       9   29    &quot;                 8                        8          It has farther been agreed that the adjustedscale should not come info operation even if the standard price has been above the market price for two years,  ifit can be shown that this price position is the resultof excessive imports of mutton and.lamb.   .18.    It is further agreed that  the Second Readingspeech on the Bill should include a  definite statementemphasising that it is not the purpose or intention ofthe Government&apos;s policy to create a  position under whichthe guaranteed price would remain permanently in excess ofthe market price.
