Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I  CIRCULATE  to  my  colleagues a  memorandum,  which  I have had prepared on the Danzig  question, in pursuance of  the request  of the LordChancellor  at the last meeting of the Cabinet.                                                                      H.    May 5, 1939.                       THE  DANZIG  QUESTION.                          Historical Introduction.    THE history of Danzig reveals the innate contradiction of its geographical position as a Polish port and its national character as a German city.    (a) Under Polish rule, 1000-1308. In  the tenth  and  eleventh centuries           Danzig,  then a small village at the  mouth of the Vistula, and the           surrounding territory formed part of the Polish  kingdom.  On the           death  of  the Polish King  Boleslas III in  1138, his kingdom was           partitioned; Danzig came under the rule of the Dukes of Pomerelia,           obtained the status of a municipality, and became a trading centre.    (b) Under the Teutonic Order, 1308-1454. The Order captured Danzig in           1308 in the name of the Polish King Ladislas, but kept  it for them-           selves.   Danzig&apos;s   prosperity  increased,  and  the  city joined  the           Hanseatic  League in  the  fourteenth  century.   Its  growing           independence brought it into conflict with the Order, and it became           united to Poland in 1454.    (c) Under Polish  rule,  1454-1793. Danzig,  while acknowledging  the           sovereignty  of the  Polish  kings,  enjoyed  a  wide  measure  of           independence.  As the  seaport of the  Polish  Hinterland and  as  a           member of the Hanseatic League  it became rich and powerful,  with           a strong sense of civic patriotism.    (d) Under Prussian rule, 1793-1807. The prosperity of Danzig had declined           in the eighteenth century and the city fell without resistance to Prussia           under the second partition of Poland.       10380  [19211]                                              B
    (e) A Free City, 1807-1814. By the Treaty of Tilsit, Danzig became a Free          City under the joint protection of France, Prussia and Saxony, and          its ancient liberties and constitution were restored.  It had, however,          a  French military governor and garrison, and suffered heavily  in the          Napoleonic wars.                                          i    (f)  Under Prussian ride, 1814-1920. On its return to Prussia, Danzig wras          reduced  to the status of a Prussian provincial capital and seaport.          In 1920, after a brief Allied Occupation, Danzig once again became          a  Free City.                      The Danzig Question at Versailles.    2.  President Wilson&apos;s thirteenth point&quot; contained the provision that poland should be given free and secure access  to the sea, and it was the problem of recon-ciling this pledge with the principle of self-determination which led to the estab-lishment of the Corridor and the Free City of Danzig.   The Polish claim to the corridor was unassailable.  From the earliest  times it  had been inhabited bySlavs and its population has  always  been predominantly  Polish.  In 1931 theprovince of Pomorze had a population of over a million, of which just over  90 percent, were Poles.  There was, however, no seaport on the coast of Pomorze, andthe Peace Conference was advised that it was not possible to create one.  It wastherefore necessary to make  use of Danzig,  the population of which was morethan 90  per  cent. German, but which geographically  and  historically was thenatural outlet for the trade and commerce of the Vistula Basin.  Both Germanyand Poland claimed Danzig in full sovereignty, and the treaty settlement was a compromise.   It will  be observed that historically there is a Polish as well as aGerman  claim to Danzig.   It has always  been a bone of  contention betweenTeuton and Slav.                           The  Treaty Settlement.    3.  The  Free  City, established   by Articles  100-108  of  the  Treaty  ofVersailles, includes  an area  of  730  square  miles and  a population of. about400,000,  of whom only some 15,000 are of Polish origin.   The territory is on anaverage about 30 miles wide and 20 miles in depth  extending on both banks ofthe Vistula, and has great potential strategic importance.   Article 102 establishedDanzig as a Free City under the protection of the League of Nations.  Article 103provided for the drafting of a Constitution in agreement with a High Commis-sioner appointed by the League.  The Constitution is placed under the guarantee of the League. The High Commissioner is entrusted with the duty of dealing inthe first instance with all differences arising  between  Poland and Danzig  inregard to the treaty or arrangements made thereunder.  The flight Commissioneris to  reside in Danzig.  Article 104  provides for the negotiation of a Danzig-Polish treaty with the following principal objects :     (a) The  inclusion of Danzig in the Polish Customs Area. ,    (&amp;) The  free use by Poland without any restriction  of  the harbour and           waterways necessary for Polish imports and exports, and the right to           develop  the harbour works.    (c) The  control and administration by Poland  of the Vistula, the railway           system,  and postal and  telegraphic  communications between Poland           and Danzig.    (d) The  prevention of discrimination against Polish citizens and persons of           Polish origin and speech.     (e) The  conduct  by Poland of the foreign relations  of the  Free  City.                              The Constitution.     4.   The Constitution was approved by the League Council in 1922.  It wasliberal in character.  It provided for a Popular Assembly elected  for four years,and a Senate elected  by the Assembly and combining the functions of a Head ofState, a Cabinet, and an Upper Chamber.  Article 4 of the Constitution providesthat German shall be the official language, but that the Polish minority shall haveguaranteed its free racial development.   Article 5 provides that Danzig cannot,without the consent of the League Council, serve as a military or naval base, erectfortifications, or manufacture munitions.
0 10&apos;i,f\                               Polish Rights.    5.  The rights given to Poland under Article 104 of the treaty were worked out by the Convention of  Paris of 1920 between Poland and Danzig, and  in greater detail by the Convention of Warsaw of 1921 (which contains 244 articles).Article 39 of  the  Convention of Paris provided that differences  arising underthe convention and  subsequent  arrangements would  be  submitted to the HighCommissioner,  who  would, if necessary,  refer to the  Council.   Both partiesretained  the right of appeal to the  Council.                  The Application of the  Treaty Settlement.    6.  The provisions of  the Treaty, the Constitution, and the conventions  of paris and Warsaw  are the foundations of the  complex events in  Danzig sincethe war.   Upon them have been superimposed  decisions of the High Commis-sioners, resolutions of the  Council,  and judgments of the Permanent Court  ofInternational Justice.    7.  The League Council sought at an early stage  to define its responsibilities for the protection of the Free City.   The commonly accepted definition  is thatthe League &quot; undertakes to respect and maintain against all foreign aggressionthe territorial integrity and political independence of Danzig &quot;  (Report  ofViscount  Ishii, 1920).  In  1921 the  Council  agreed  that Poland is &quot; speciallyfitted to  ensure the defence of  Danzig by land as well as the maintenance  of order,  on the territory,&quot; and  the High Commissioner was empowered to call inPolish troops  in  the event  of an aggression-or a danger of  aggression from a neighbouring country other than Poland, as well as for the maintenance of orderin the territory.  This situation has not yet arisen.                             Danzig since 1920.    8.  The  post-war  history  of  Danzig may be  divided  into  two  periods,1920-1933 and 1933-1939.    9.  In the period 1920-33 there were endless disputes  between Danzig and poland arising from the application of the treaty settlement, mostly on economic questions, and the main task of the High  Commissioner and the Council was toarbitrate  between them.   The  difficulty of  enforcing  its  decisions in Danzigwas, however, always a problem for the Council.    10.  In the  period 1933-39 the position  changed.  The  rise of nationalsocialism, which had inevitable repercussions in Danzig, led to a  settlement  by direct negotiation of the outstanding questions between Danzig and Poland, and,after  the  signature  of the  Polish-German  declaration of 1934, the  Council wastroubled  no more with Polish-Danzig disputes.  These continued, but were dealtwith  outside  Geneva.  But  the efforts  to introduce  national  socialism intoDanzig led to encroachments on the rights  of minorities and threats to theConstitution, and, instead of constant disputes between Danzig and Poland, therewere disputes between Danzig  and the  Council itself.  It was legally possibleto modify the Constitution, with the approval  of the Council, by  a two-thirdsvote of the Popular Assembly.  But in the elections of  1934 the Nazis failed bya  narrow  margin to obtain  this  majority.    They accordingly proceeded  byillegal means, and developments led in 1935 to  an open breach with the Counciland to the resignation of the High Commissioner, Mr.  Lester.   The PolishGovernment was invited to use their influence with the Danzig  Senate, and, aftercomplicated and  difficult  negotiations, the Council  agreed to appoint anotherHigh Commissioner, M. Burckhardt, it being tacitly understood that the  processof nazification in Danzig could not be reversed.  The Council  took  this decisions with reluctance and largely to satisfy Poland, but until October 1938 the position was tolerable.   M.  Burckhardt, by  the  exercise  of  great  diplomatic skill,established good  relations  with the Senate and was  able to. mitigate the lot ofthe minorities and to prevent open breaches of the Constitution.  But he dependedfpr the efficacy of his action almost entirely on his personal  influence; the events in Czecho-Slovakia and the anti-Semitic outbursts in Germany forced the issue;and there were breaches of the  Constitution which the Council could no longerignore.  Only the insistence  of Poland,  and the  difficulty for the Council  of       [19211]                                                      B 2
modifying unilaterally the treaty position, has hitherto prevented the withdrawalof the High Commissioner and an alteration in the League&apos;s connexion with theFree City.                               Polish Policy.    11.  Until  1934 Polish policy was  to maintain  Polish treaty  rights  inDanzig by  invoking the assistance  of  the Council.   After  1934 the  PolishGovernment perceived the threat to  their interests from national socialism inDanzig, and, relying on their agreement with Germany for the maintenance ofthe&apos; status of the Free City and their own rights,  sought to conjure the threatby  condoning the nazification  of  the Free City.   By failing to support theCouncil&apos;s  efforts to  maintain the constitution, they thereby contributed to the weakening and the final undermining of the authority of the  League and its HighCommissioner.   They have, however, insisted on the maintenance of the League&apos;sconnexion with  Danzig with the object of using it as a bargaining counter in negotiations with Germany.                    Policy  of  His Majesty&apos;s Government.    12.  As  Rapporteur to the Council  for Danzig  questions His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment have a special responsibility.  Since 1936 they  have endeavoured tosupport the  authority of the High Commissioner, while letting it be known bothin Berlin  and Warsaw that they would welcome any modification of the presentstatus of the Free City on which both Germany and Poland would agree.  Suchan agreement, or the establishment, as the result of elections which were due tobe held in  the Spring of this year, of a Nazi majority of two-thirds in the PopularAssembly, would have  created  a new situation,  and  might have enabled theLeague to modify and perhaps  to relinquish its responsibilities in Danzig.              Internal situation in Danzig and German policy.    13.  Events in Danzig  itself have the pettiness and  often the absurdity ofthose  in a small provincial town.  In the earlier post-war years the Senate was mainly concerned  to resist  Polish encroachments  and revive the  tradition  of danzig independence and autonomy.  In  1933  there  was an internal politicalstruggle ending  in  the  elimination by the Nazis of the other political  parties.Since 1936, there has been a latent contest between the President of the Senate,Herr  Greiser, and the local  Gauleiter, Herr Forster.   Herr  Greiser&apos;s object hasbeen to maintain his own authority as the ruler of a Free City, and he has, there-fore, shown no enthusiasm for a change in the status of Danzig and union withGermany.   He  has been supported by Field-Marshal  Goering and has workedfor the maintenance of the League High  Commissioner.   Herr Forster, with thesupport of Herr Hitler, has advocated a  policy of complete  nazification, but hashitherto  been restrained from  demanding union with Germany.   Relationsbetween Danzig  and Germany have always been close, and  there is an interchange of civil servants between the administrations.  The Free  City internally is nowvirtually a. microcosm of the Reich, but  the  German Government  have until recently shown no desire to change the status of the  Free  City or to negotiatedirect with  the  Polish  Government;  they  have, indeed,  tacitly encouraged theretention of the League High  Commissioner.  As  they were reluctant to agreeto a modus  vivencli over Danzig and were not ready to impose  a totalitariansolution, the presence of a neutral authority in Danzig was of convenience to them,so long as there was no serious check on internal developments.                             Economic Position.  ;  14.  Danzig depends for its prosperity on its transit and entrepot trade; andit was in the interests of Danzig to facilitate Polish commerce in the Free City.But the tradition of independence and national feeling put every difficulty in theway of the  Poles;  In  1920, when the Poles were fighting  the Bolsheviks, theDanzig authorities held up the supply of munitions.  The Poles never forgot this,and subsequent  disputes convinced them that their  access to the sea  throughDanzig was not secure.  They therefore decided to develop  Gdynia.  There wasalso a strategical reason : Danzig could not be fortified, and a Polish naval base
would  facilitate the defence of the  corridor,  and provide another good reasonagainst its  return  to Germany.  The competition of Gdynia  (8  miles  fromDanzig) alarmed the  Danzigers.  In 1921, a decision of the League High  Com-missioner  had provided that the Polish Government would engage to make full use of  the port of Danzig whatever other ports she might open in future on theBaltic  coast, and the Danzig  Senate  repeatedly  &quot;elied  on  this  provision inprotesting at the growing Polish use of Gdynia.  Innally,  in 1933, an agreement was reached between Danzig and Poland by which the Polish Government under-took to &quot;ensure for the Port of Danzig, so far as  lay in its power, equalparticipation with Gdynia  in the  sea-borne  traffic,  taking  into account thequantity and quality of  the goods.&quot;  Poland  has not fully observed this agree-ment, and the disparity though small in point of volume has been  considerable in point  of  value.   Until recently,  however,  Danzig   has been   comparativelyprosperous,  the volume of traffic having progressively  increased  from 1933-38;she has also had a number of shipbuilding orders from Germany.  Two factorshave, however,  struck a  serious blow at the economic stability of Danzig.   the anti-Jewish campaign has led  to the departure of  the  wealthy Jews with  their capital and to  the closing  down of  a number  of prosperous Jewish businesses.And the absorption  of  Czecho-Slovakia  by Germany  has caused a disastrousdecline in the formerly important transit traffic between  that country and Danzig,since Germany has diverted this traffic to purely German ports.  Trie consequencehas been a  steady decline in the gold  cover of the Danzig gulden, which hasalready once been devalued, and the introduction of measures of currency restric-tion which  have further undermined confidence.  Meanwhile,  the Senate has-embarked on grandiose  and expensive Nazi  building schemes,  for which the contractor is Herr Forster&apos;s father-in-law.  There is accordingly some reason to fear a  financial and economic collapse in  the near future.                              Present Position.     15.  In  1938 there  was  a likelihood of  Polish-German negotiations overDanzig.  At Colonel Beck&apos;s interview with Herr Hitler in  December, Herr Hitlergave him  assurances  that he was prepared for the moment to leave the Danzigquestion on one side, and both Germany and Poland pressed  for  the temporarymaintenance of the League  position in Danzig.  No progress was made duringHerr von Ribbentrop&apos;s  visit to Warsaw in  January.  Immediately after theGerman coup in Prague, German pressure was promptly applied  in the East, onLithuania, Poland, and Roumania.   Certain demands, the exact nature of whichare not yet fully known,  as the Polish Government do not agree with the accountgiven in Herr Hitler&apos;s speech of the 28th April, were made on Poland in respectof Danzig and  the Corridor, and the High Commissioner was warned by Berlinthat it would be healthy for him to  leave.  Preparations  were apparently  beingmade for a  coup de main in Danzig, and  there is reason to believe that this wasonly forestalled by the partial Polish mobilisation on  the 23rd  March and theBritish guarantee to Poland on the 31st March.     16.  The German demands almost certainly included (1) the return of Danzig&quot;as a Pree City&quot; to the Reich, (2) the grant of an  extra-territorial corridoracross  the Corridor,  (3)  an  alignment  of Polish policy with that-of the Axisand perhaps Polish  adherence to the Anti-Comintern  Pact.   In return, theGermans say they were ready to maintain the Polish economic rights in Danzig;guarantee the Polish frontiers; and to make  some arrangement  to allay Polishfears about Slovakia. The  Polish attitude was that they were perfectly  readyto negotiate a&apos;new settlement of the Danzig question, and  were willing to abolish the servitudes on Danzig sovereignty, i.e., their control over the  foreign affairs of Danzig, and the &quot;  protection &quot; of the League of Nations, as well as to improve the transit  facilities across  the Corridor, but they  demanded that the status of Danzig as a Free  City should be maintained and that the Free State shouldnot be  remilitarised, and they refused in their  turn  to accept a German servitudeon  the Polish Corridor.  The Poles  say that they are quite willing to treat theDanzig question on its merits but not to negotiate under menaces, and they willnot surrender their vital interest in the security of their outlet to&quot;the sea.     17.  It will readily be appreciated  that  the Danzig,  question, which  isintimately bound up  with that of the Corridor, can no  longer be  considered as  a
purely local question, the adjustment of German and Polish claims in a smallterritory.   It has become a test case and the stakes may not be lower than theGerman attempt at domination of Eastern  Europe, and Polish determination tomaintain the independence of their foreign policy.    18.  For  Poland the problem is strategic and psychological  as well aseconomic.   The essential point strategically  is  that Danzig should  remaindemilitarised.   The Polish  Government  have  been  impressed by  the  rapidmilitarisation  of  Memel, and they realise  that if Danzig  is similarly fortifiedGermany will acquire a stranglehold on the Corridor, and  Gdynia will finallybecome untenable.  At present Germany has comparatively  few troops in east prussia, and communications with Danzig are difficult.  Polish troops can occupyDanzig in  a few hours.  If  it be assumed that Poland would resist a german occupation of  Danzig, the only sure method for Germany is to occupy Danzig inforce from across the Corridor, i.e., by the  invasion of  Poland.  In presentconditions  Germany could not easily reinforce East Prussia  across the Corridorwithout the knowledge of Poland.    19.  Psychologically, Polish rights  in  Danzig, where their main  river findsits outlet to the  sea, are a symbol of their national existence.   If  the PolishGovernment made  concessions  in Danzig  and the  Corridor  of a  nature to compromise their vital interests, not only would the confidence of Poles in themselves  and their Government be undermined, but  it is extremely  probablethat anti-German incidents  in  the  Corridor  would  occur.  The  results  wouldprobably be German intervention or  something akin to  civil war in Poland.    20.  Poles object to the use of the term Corridor.  They regard this area asPolish territory proper the province of Pomorze which happens to be boundedon the North by the Baltic Sea, on the East by East Prussia, and on the West byWest Prussia.  It is, in their view, not  merely &apos;&apos; an outlet  to the sea &apos;&apos; toleratedby Germany, but ethnographically and historically a Polish province.   In a word,Danzig and the Corridor are regarded by Poland as part of her &quot; Lebensraum.&quot;    21.  This aspect has considerable bearing on the refusal to allow an extra-territorial  road and railway to be  given  to  Germany across Polish territory,though they are willing to reduce visa and  passport facilities to a minimum.  Itshould be  remembered  that the present  arrangements for  transit  across  the corridor have worked  quite satisfactorily,  certainly  since  1934.   Further,  a unilateral solution of the Danzig question, i.e., the concession of German claims against Pol and&apos;s will, would in fact not be a solution. For Poland could andwould starve Danzig economically by refusing to use the harbour.   Germany&apos;sinevitable  answer would be  to insist that  Poland should  cease this  boycott,  asJapan did in  the  case of  China;  and the result  would  be war or  Poland&apos;ssubservience to Germany.    22.  Oh the  German side the issue is  equally plain.  Their object is to use the Danzig and Corridor questions  as  a lever to secure the neutralisation and ultimately, perhaps, a further partition of Poland.  There is good evidence toshow that  Germany regards Danzig  merely as a &quot; pawn in the game,&quot; and thather real aim is the break-up of the Polish State.  The recent German note to poland clearly implies  that it  is a condition of  further  negotiations that thePolish Government  should  relinquish their  understandings with the western powers.  Meanwhile, all the resources of  German propaganda are directed, asregards Poland, to the  thesis that England will not  fulfil her guarantee on theissue of Danzig,  and,  as regards England, to the thesis  that  Polish rights  inDanzig are not worth supporting.  ;  23.  It does not at  present appear to be probable that Germany will attemptto impose a solution of Danzig or the Corridor by force, if she is certain that shewill thereby become involved in a general war.   It is certain that the Poles wouldresist such an attempt by force of arms.  It is, however, always possible that theDanzig Senate and Popular Assembly might declare their desire to be incorporated in the Reich.  Polish action in such  a case  is uncertain.  If the declaration wereunaccompanied by any  further  step, the situation would not be greatly altered.The mandate of the Danzig Popular Assembly has expired, and in any case sucha declaration  could not have any effect on the  status of the Free City, which canonly be altered by. force or by a revision of existing agreements. If it were accom-
panied by an attempt to seize the Polish customs and Polish property in the FreeCity, the Poles would in all probability intervene to protect their rights.  It isdifficult to see  how  the effect of such a declaration could materially alter  thesituation, unless it was used as a pretext for armed German intervention.  But itis  probable that any unilateral  alteration of the status  of Danzig  would beregarded by Poland as so provocative and so detrimental to  her real independencethat the ensuing deterioration of her relations with Germany would lead to actualhostilities.     24.  Moreover, such a declaration by the Senate would  not be a valid pretext.It has already  been shown that internally Danzig is a microcosm of the Reich,and if it is maintained that a declaration by the Senate  could have the conse-quence of altering the status of Danzig, it could also be maintained that a similarprinciple of self-determination  should be  applied elsewhere, e.g., in Prague.     25.  In spite of the allegations of the German press, the present  attitudeof Poland cannot be described as provocative.  There are allegations on both sides of ill-treatment of  the respective minorities, which  are approximately equal in size,  but such  incidents as have taken place have been  entirely of  a minorcharacter and such as have occurred without  serious results at intervals duringthe past twenty years.  It is clear that such incidents, whether real or manufac-tnred, do not affect the fundamental issues at stake, and would not in themselvesjustify  a German ultimatum  to  Poland any  more than a Polish ultimatum toGermany.Colonel Beck&apos;s Reply to Herr Hitler.     26.  Colonel  Beck&apos;s  speech  was  firm  but unprovocative  in   tone andsubstance.   He  put  the  Danzig  question  in  its  historical  setting.    &apos;&quot;&apos; ThoFree City  has  existed for  many centuries as a result properly speaking, if weexclude the emotional element, of a positive &apos; cross &apos; between German  and Polishinterests.&quot;   &quot; The  German merchants of  Danzig assured  the development and prosperity  of the city, thanks to Polish overseas trade.&quot;  &quot;  The population is pre-dominantly. German  but  its livelihood  depends  on the  economic potential ofPoland.&quot;  &quot;We stand firmly on the ground  of  the rights and interests of  our overseas trade  .... but we  have purposely not exerted  any  influence on  thefree national ideological and cultural  development of the German  majority.&quot;Colonel Beck after quoting the German assurances previously given to him thatDanzig would not be the object of conflict between Poland and Germany enquiresthe purpose of German policy.  Is it the freedom of the German population (whichis not menaced), or  a question of barring Poland from the Baltic ?     27.  Colonel Beck referred to his positive proposals  that there should be acommon German-Polish guarantee  of the existence and rights of the Free City.As regards the  &quot; Corridor &quot; (and he objected to the application of this word toan &quot; ancient Polish land &quot;) Poland had already given to  Germany full railwaytransit  facilities and was prepared to extend these facilities to road transport.Poland had, however, no ground whatever for restricting her sovereignty overher own territory.     28.  Colonel Beck  denied that the Polish  Government had knowledge ofconcrete German proposals about  Slovakia and  a pact of non-aggression.  Asregards  the former,  he said  that Poland would not make  bargains  with  theinterests of others.  As regards the second, he pointed out that recognition of thePolish frontiers would merely be recognition of what was indisputably Polishproperty.     29.  He therefore claimed that Germany was asking  Poland  for one-sidedconcessions over Danzig.     30.  In conclusion, he  stressed Poland&apos;s desire for peace; there were  twoconditions  for this :  (1) peaceful intentions, and (2) peaceful methods of action.If these conditions were observed,  all conversations were possible.  If conversa-tions materialised,  Poland would regard the  problem  objectively  and withgoodwill.     31.  The implied doubt as  to the aims  of  German   policy is fully under-standable,  and there is  nothing in Colonel Beck&apos;s speech to which a Government
which was concerned only with the problem of a new settlement of the status of danzig could take  exception.  He has  left the  door wide  open for  further conversations; he has advanced no unreasonable claims, and made  no demands.But the effect of the speech is apparently to pass the initiative back to germany as regards the prosecution of further negotiations.    32.
