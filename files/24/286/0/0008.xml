At their 356th Meeting, held on the 11th May,1939,the Committee of Imperial Defence had under consideration a note &quot;by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,covering a Memorandum by the Chairman of the SupplyBoard on the subject of flax (O.I.D. Paper No.D.P.R. 310).2.     THE COMMITTEE OP IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed -(a)(i)   That the Service Departments           should be invited to consider           and to report to the Committee           of Imperial Defence the extent           of the reserves of finished linen           products which they should           accumulate forthwith.  (ii)   That no approach should be made           to the Russian Government with           a view to obtaining the           reopening of the export of           flax either in peace or war,           until deemed opportune by the           Board of Trade. (lit)   That, as a practical step towards           encouragement of the development           of home, grown flax and of the           natural fibre process, the           Norfolk Experimental Station           should be taken over by the           Government at the end of the           current season,(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT)
9 1 i   J.                             (iv)   That early steps should &quot;be taken                                      to acquire all supplies                                      available during the 1939                                      season of pedigree seed.                              (v)   That a  single Controlling                                      Government Department is                                      necessary for the development                                      of flax production and of                                      processing at the Norfolk                                      Station.                             (vi)   That the First Lord of the                                      Admiralty and the Minister                                      of Supply-designate should                                      discuss and report to the                                      Committee of Imperial Defence                                      whether the Admiralty or                                      the Ministry of Supply should                                      be the Controlling Department.                          (&quot;to) i       That the Note by the Chancellor                                      of the Duchy of Lancaster,                                      covering a Memorandum by the                                      Chairman of the Supply Board                                      on the subject of Flax (C.I.D.                                      Paper No. D.P.R. 310), together                                      with  the Minutes of the                                      discussion in the Committee                                      of Imperial Defence and the                                      conclusions thereon, should be                                      forwarded to the Cabinet.             3.      It will be  seen that the measures proposed             contemplate a considerable  degree of Government action             in regard to the development of the flax industry, more             particularly in regard to the natural fibre process.             For this reason reference to the Cabinet was thought             desirable.                    I therefore  circulate for the information of             my colleagues a copy of the Note by the Chancellor of             the Duchy of Lancaster, covering a Memorandum by the             Chairman of the Supply Board on flax (Enclosure No. 1,)             and the relevant extract  from the DRAFT Minutes of the             Committee of Imperial Defence (Enclosure No. 2.)

ENCLOSURE.                                   FLAX.             Memorandum by the Chairman of the Supply Board.     ON the 1st November, 1937, the  Sub-Committee on the  Supply of Flax intime of War was appointed to examine the question of the supply of flax in timeof war.     At its 327th Meeting held on the 23rd June, 1938, the Committee of ImperialDefence* approved the recommendations.of the Sub-Committee,t which were asfollows :    &quot; (a) We do not feel able to recommend any action to secure a guaranteed price           to growers of flax, or of pedigree flax seed, or to amass a reserve of flax.     (5) We  think  that, whilst in an  emergency service requirements  must be           paramount, the needs of the civil trade  cannot be wholly overlooked,           as this  would jeopardize  the  very existence of the linen industry,           which would be contrary to the national interest.     (c) We think that the position may be profoundly affected and considerably           improved by certain pending developments.  We recommend that these           should be kept under constant review, and that the extension to Great           Britain of the operations  initiated by the Government of Northern           Ireland should  be considered  by the  appropriate Departments of           Government as a matter of immediate urgency.     (d) We  think that the Service Departments, while maintaining alternative           specifications for  substitute fabrics,  should make  more use of such           fabrics in peace time.     (e) We think that all arrangements must be made in peace for  immediate           flax control in emergency.     (/) We think that Service Departments should forthwith proceed to amass           reserves of finished products.&quot;t     2.  Owing to numerous enquiries as to the flax  position both inside  and outside Parliament, I  thought it advisable  recently  to call a Meeting  of depart-mental representatives to consider  the  action taken  on the recommendationsdetailed above, and  I have based this memorandum on the conclusions of that meeting.3. Action by the Service Departments.     I  would like first to deal with  the recommendations (d)  and  (/) of theSub-Committee, regarding the  use of substitute fabrics in peace and the  massingof reserves of linen products of the Service Departments, the  intention of whichwas to safeguard the services against the disclosed shortage of flax in emergency.     The Admiralty have increased their reserves of linen products to  a quantitycovering three months&apos; expenditure in war. which,  together with stocks of fibreavailable in the trade, should make their position secure for the first six monthsof war.  The Admiralty have not,  however, felt able to increase  their use ofsubstitute fabrics  in  peace, pending a Government decision on the question ofincreasing the home production of flax, but are prepared to make use of substi-tutes, should necessity arise.   The War Office and the Air Ministry have not  laiddown specific reserves, though reserves of fabric are  held by the Air Ministry for maintenance purposes, while aircraft manufacturers carry large stocks but fortheir work in hand.     I  recommend&quot; that the attention of the Admiralty should  again be drawn torecommendation (d) of the Sub-Committee on the Supply of Flax in Time of War,    * C.I.D. 327th Meeting, Minute 4.    f C.I.D. Paper No. D.P.R. 274.    % In paragraph 24 of the Report (C.I.D. Paper No. D.P.R. 274) it was recommended thatthis ^reserve of finished products should cover at least 12 months&apos; estimated war requirements.
regarding the use of substitute  fabrics,  and the attention  of  all three service departments to recommendation (/), regarding the amassing of reserves, witha view, in the case of the Admiralty, to  consideration whether it would not be^prudent to increase the reserves now held.4.  Service Requirements in War.    The minimum  essential  service requirements  in  war  amount to  some-15,000 tons  of  flax per annum.  Over and above these minimum requirements,there is an undefined desirable requirement covering items for which substitutionis possible, but only on grounds of serious necessity.*    Approximately  7,000 tons  of these  requirements could,  in  emergency, be-made from flax produced  in Northern Ireland, but, since the manufacture of theservice  fabrics  required would have to be carried out mostly in Scotland,  therewould be little or no work left for  the Northern  Ireland mills if the NorthernIreland crop were taken over.   These mills  have,  however, an important and valuable export trade to the U.S.A., and certain of them must be kept going, asthey are almost the onlv source of supply of  thread for boots, uniforms, and so-forth.    The disclosed deficiency of at least 8,000 tons  a  year  (which excludes anyreserves of finished products which  may have been amassed) does not appear to-be so large as to call for exceptional  measures  of subsidies or guarantee of prices,.which  are  often recommended  by persons interested  in flax  growing  orprocessing or who remember the large service demands for flax in the last warand think they will be repeated.  The deficiency would in the past have been met from imported flax.  A new situation has, however, arisen owing to the cessation of exports from Russia,  which is the major source  of supply.  No information is available  as to the probable attitude of the Russians to a  request for supplies-in time of  war,  when  political considerations  would  be  paramount,  and  i recommend that an approach should be made to the Russian  Government witha view to obtaining the reopening of  the export of flax in peace and in war.5.  Natural fibre process.    In its recommendation (e), the Sub-Committee on the Supply of Flax in Timeof War drew attention to &apos;&apos; certain pending developments &apos;&apos; in connection with thenatural fibre process.  In the body of their  Report (paragraph 22) the Sub-Committee said in this connection :-        &quot; . . . . this is a matter of sufficient importance and promise to warrant an.    immediate intensification of research and large-scale experiment, in order-    that the foundations may  be laid here and now for rapid expansion in an    emergency, should the results of the Admiralty experiments indicate that    this is desirable.  Normally, further experiment should wait upon the ascer-    tainment of those results, but so great is the importance of  this development    as a potential factor in increasing the supplies of home-grown fibre, that we    feel that in this instance, having regard  alike to  the urgency and difficulty    of the problem, a departure from normal procedure might be justified.....&quot;    Experiment  by  the Admiralty  has now  shown that fabric, satisfactory inevery way, can be manufactured from flax  treated by the natural fibre process.This process has  many advantages.  No special skill is required, there is no riskof under  or over-retting, it is independent of the weather,  and fibre  extractioncan be started immediately after the harvest.   It  is also a cheaper process thanretting, and may assist  the flax industry to  attain a solid foundation  in this.country. The Admiralty  regard the development of this process on a large scaleas essential  for safeguarding war-time supplies of flax, and it appears to me of.&quot;very great importance for the future of the flax industry as a whole.6.  The  Norfolk Flaw Experimental Station.    Evolution of pedigree flax  seed  and research on controlled tank retting have-been  conducted by the  Norfolk flax  Experimental  Station,  which  has been    * NOTE. A. census taken by the Board of Trade as at the end of December 1938 disclosed&quot;stocks of some 30,000 tons of all grades of linen fibre and tow.  A further census as at the endof March 1939 is not yet complete, but it is believed that stocks remain of about the same order.       [19123]                                                      B 2
operated by the Linen Industry Research Association and a commercial syndicateof the Linen Industry.  This Station also assisted in the experiments on naturalfibre production and is extending its operations for the current season to naturalflax production on a far larger scale  on the understanding that the Governmentguarantees an outlet for the natural fibre products, and undertakes to contributesome   2,000 towards the cost of the new and additional  machinery needed forextracting natural flax fibre.  The present organisation is,  however, not preparedto continue the operation of the Norfolk Station after the present season,  whichcloses in September.                                        .    Hence, if the Station is to be taken over by the Government, a decision mustbe  arrived at before Parliament rises for the summer Recess  next July.   Thecost of taking over the Station and running it as an economic unit of some,000 acres would be of the order of  30,000 capital, plus an annual recurringcharge for financing the crop, which would be recovered subsequently by the saleof fibre to the linen manufacturers and the sale of seed to the growers.    In view of the  importance of the natural fibre process both in developing the flax industry and in assisting rapid expansion in war, I  strongly recommendthat the Government should take over the  Norfolk Flax  Experimental Stationfor the development of the process on an enlarged scale so that there may be a fully  equipped  &apos;&apos; pilot&apos;&apos; plant of a commercial size  to  serve as a  centre fordisinterested&apos; advice  for similar commercial enterprises which would be necessaryfor any substantial increase of home grown flax.7.  Flaw Seed.    The acquisition of reserves of pedigree flax  seed is of importance to ensurerapid expansion  of production in war.    The flax acreage in crop for 1939  in  England  only (excluding NorthernIreland) is approximately 3,000.   Any expansion of this acreage for the currentseason is now impossible.  The 3,000 acres will, however, produce in 1939 sufficientpedigree seed to sow 15,000 acres in 1940.  On the assumption that one acre will produce two tons of straw (or two-fifths of a ton of fibre), it would be possible,  ifthis seed were  purchased, to secure  in 1940  a  crop of 6,000 tons  of fibre,  whichwould go a considerable distance towards meeting the deficiency of service require-menfs in war above mentioned,  It is of importance that only pedigree seed shouldbe  acquired, and an early decision is necessary, since the harvest  is due in July.Failure to secure available supplies of pedigree  seed  from the  1939 crop  would jeopardise the  1940 cropping in Great Britain,  as  the seed would  otherwise be sold to growers in Ireland or abroad (where the natural increase would  either be lost in retting dams or might even be crushed for cattle  food).    I, therefore, recommend that, as an insurance against the possible necessityof  securing  extended cultivation  in  1940, very early action should be taken  toacquire all supplies of pedigree seed available in England  from the 1939 season&apos;scrops.8.  Controlling Department.    Difficulty has been experienced,  and progress has been slow in the past for various reasons,  one of which requires special attention.  No one Governmentdepartment  is  responsible for flax through all its processes to the point of sale to  the linen manufacturers.   The growing  of the raw material would normally be  of concern to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, who, however,  do notconsider that any specific action with flax, such as was taken with sugar beet, is justified from  the agricultural point of view.  The development of the naturalfibre  process would normally be a matter for the Department of Scientific andIndustrial Research.  The Board of Trade  have a  general interest in the linenindustry.     The difficulty of departmental attribution of funds and of responsibility calls for centralization of control in one Department.  &quot;When funds had recently to  beprovided on estimates  to keep  the  Norfolk Experimental Station in  being,provision was made as  a special measure on Admiralty estimates in  order to save the position. It may well be that the Board of Admiralty may be reluctant  tocontinue this provision on their estimates on the enlarged scale above suggested,but it is thought that on the whole this is probably the best solution.
Summary of Conclusions.  I summarise my-recommendations as follows :   (a) That the Admiralty should be invited to give further consideration to        recommendation  (d) of the Sub-Committee on the Supply of Flax in        Time of War, which was as follows :       &quot; (d)  We  think that  the  Service Departments,  while maintaining              alternative specifications  for substitute fabrics, should make              more use of such fabrics  in peace time.&quot;        (Paragraph 3.)  (b) That the Service Departments  should &apos; be  invited to give further con-        sideration to recommendation (/) of the Sub-Committee on the Supply        of Flax in Time of War, which was as  follows :       &quot; (/)  We  think  that Service Departments  should forthwith proceed              to amass reserves of finished products.&quot;        (Paragraph 3.)  (c) That an  approach should be made to the Russian  Government with a        view to  obtaining the reopening of the export of flax both in peace        and Avar.  (Paragraph 4.)  (d) That, as a  practical step towards encouragement of the development of        home-grown flax  and of the natural fibre&apos;process,  the Norfolk Experi-        mental Station should be taken over by the Government at the end of the        current season.  (Paragraphs 5 and 6.)v  (e) That early  steps should be taken to acquire  all supplies available during        the  1939 season of pedigree seed.  (Paragraph 7.)  (/) That a single controlling Government department is necessary  for the        development of flax production and processing at the Norfolk Station        and that the assumption of this function by the Admiralty is probably        the  best solution.

Paper No. D.P.R. 310.)     (Previous reference:  C.I.D. Minutes of the 327th Meeting, Minute 4.)     THE COMMITTEE had under  consideration a note by the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster covering a Memorandum by the Chairman of the SupplyBoard on the subject of flax  (C.I.D. Paper No. D.P.R. 310).     SIR ARTHUR ROBINSON, introducing his Memorandum, said that it followed the findings of the report of an earlier Committee* which was approvedby the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 23rd June, 1938. t He had thoughtit as well to  investigate the action taken on the previous Report, and for thatpurpose had  called a meeting of  representatives of  the Departments concerned.His memorandum was  the result.  It  suggested certain moderate steps, short ofdrastic remedies such as guaranteed prices, subsidies and so forth, for which thecase on defence grounds was not very  convincing.     SIR ARTHUR ROBINSON then proceeded to explain his recommendations in detail. As regards  (a)  and (6), some  action had been taken by the admiralty in amassing reserves, and it  was suggested that they should go further than theyhad already done.  The cessation of Russian exports referred to in recommenda-tion (c) had caused misgivings,  and it was felt that an effort should  be made toobtain the reopening of the export of  flax.  Recommendation  (d) referred to theprocessing, and not the growing, of flax.  The new system under trial was bothquicker  and  cheaper than the  old.  Experiments were centred in the NorfolkExperimental Station,  which was being kept going for the 1939 season  by theAdmiralty.  The proposal was that the Government should take over the station and continue the  experiments.   Recommendation (e) was a proposal for  thepurchase of seed to ensure the possibility of expanding flax production in 1940,if necessary.  Recommendation  (/) raised the thorny question  of who should run the Station.   This had proved a  very difficult matter to settle. He was well aware of the anomaly of the  suggestion  that the Admiralty was the best departmentto take charge, but could think  of nothing better.     LORD STANHOPE was  in favour of the Government taking  over  the norfolk Station..  The Admiralty had  no objection to assuming the responsibilityfor the Station, but the Ministry of Supply was possibly now the more appropriate department.  Referring to recommendation  (a) he pointed out that the amountof linen used by the Admiralty was very small  and represented only 5 per cent.of the total output.  For this reason the Admiralty were averse to using substitutefabrics of inferior quality to linen.     MR.  BURGIN said that he had not  yet had time to formulate definite viewson  the responsibility for the Norfolk Station.   The important thing was  thatthe Station should continue.  He suggested that he should discuss  the matterdirect with the First Lord of the Admiralty.                         * C.I.D.

     In reply to a question from Lord  Chatfield, SIR ARTHUR ROBINSONsaid, with reference to recommendation (6), that the original Committee had inmind the amassing of a 12 months&apos; reserve of finished products.     SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said  that the Air Ministry held a four months&apos;reserve.   Further, their contractors  were in possession  of  consumable  stockscovering from six to nine months&apos; expenditure.  Linen was not vital to the AirMinistry  owing to the introduction of metal aircraft and  the use of  cottonsubstitutes.  ;.   SIR ARTHUR ROBINSON said- that the Admiralty had collected a threemonths&apos; reserve, but had stopped at that point, pending the development of policy regarding flax.     In reply to a question from Lord Chatfield,  LORD GORT said  that for expansion purposes under the recent decisions, the War Office would require theentire  flax output for the next nine months.  They would welcome the accumula-tion of a reserve.     SIR WILLIAM BROWN said that the Board of Trade considered thatthere was no case on commercial grounds for the development  of flax production.The; case rested on defence requirements.     SIR DONALD FERGUSSON  agreed.  There was no doubt that farmers would  grow flax, if it were an economic proposition.  At present they could not obtain a remunerative price.     SIR ARTHUR ROBINSON pointed out that this  was probably due to thedifficulties of processing.   Enthusiasts maintained that, if the  Norfolk systemproved successful, flax would become an economic proposition.     In reply to a question from Sir  Alan Barlow,  SIR ARTHUR ROBINSONsaid that the Linen Industry Research Association and the trade had refused tocontinue to run the Station after the  present season.     SIR WILLIAM BROWN, referring to recommendation (c), said that noapproach had been made to the Russians during the recent trade negotiations to reopen the export of flax.   They had, in fact, been told that  we had no need of flax. The present was not an opportune time for such an approach, as we wishedto avoid giving the Russians the impression during the negotiations that we were asking for assistance.     DR. APPLETON said that it was most important to take over the staff of the norfolk Station, if the Government were to run the Station.  The staff had been responsible for the development of the non-retting system.  Processing was reallyan agricultural problem.     MR.  MORRISON  suggested that  processing  should  be  considered  an industrial rather than an agricultural, problem. .     DR.  APPLETON  said  that it was  a question of location.   The cropdeteriorated if taken to central mills.  Hence processing should be carried out bythe farmers in the locality  in which the flax was grown.     SIR ARTHUR ROBINSON said that he had tried hard to persuade either the Board  of Trade or  the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries  to take overthe responsibility for flax production.  It was essential that one single department should be made  responsible.    If this department were to be  the  Ministry ofSupply a specialist staff would be required.     SIR  DONALD FERGUSSON  maintained  that processing was not  an agricultural matter.                         ..                         -     LORD CHATFJELD suggested  that recommendation (b) should be rewordedto allow latitude to the Service Departments to determine the size of the reserve of linen products which they would accumulate. .     SIR ALAN BARLOW said that  the Treasury had no objection to- theproposals contained in the memorandum:
                           CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed:-(a)  (i) That the Service Departments should be invited to consider and  to      report to the Committee of Imperial Defence the extent of the reserves      of finished linen products which they should accumulate forthwith. (ii)  That no approach should he made to the Russian Government with a      view to obtaining the reopening of the export of flax either in peace      or war, until deemed opportune by the Board of Trade.(iii) That, as a practical step towards encouragement of the development  of      home-grown  flax  and  of  the  natural  fibre process,  the Norfolk      Experimental Station should be  taken over by the Government at the.      end of the current season. (iv) That early steps should be taken to acquire all supplies available during      the 1939 season of pedigree seed. (v) That a single Controlling Government Department is necessary for the      development of flax production and of  processing at the Norfolk      Station. (vi) That the First Lord of the Admiralty and  the Minister of Supply-      designate should discuss and report  to  the Committee of  Imperial      Defence whether the Admiralty  or the Ministry of  Supply should  be      the Controlling Department.(5)  That the Note by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, covering a      Memorandum by the Chairman of the Supply Board on the subject  of      Flax  (C.I.D. Paper No. D.P.R. 310), together with the Minutes of the      discussion in the Committee of Imperial Defence and the conclusions      thereon, should be forwarded to the Cabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,      May 11,  1939.
