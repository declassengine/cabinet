COIMITTEE ON             With reference to P. P. (36) 47th.. Gone 1 us ions.,FOREIGN POLICY..                  and in pursuance of Cabinet 28 (39) Conclusion 1 (3)     * o * *                  the Committee continued the discussion in regard toThe Inter-        the negotiations with Russia.national situation.               THE PRIME MINISTER observed that notwithstanding                  that the House of Commons were debating the question the Negotiationswith Russia.      that day, he had thought it necessary for the Committee                  to meet to hear about the latest developments in the                  situation and to decide on the next step to &quot;be taken,                         THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS^                  reminded the Committee&apos; that at midday on Tuesday, -May                  16th., Sir Robert Vansittart had had a long conversat-                  ion with M. Maisky, a summary of which had been                  circulated as Appendix I to F. P. (36) 47th. Conclusions.                  In the course of this conversation M* Maisky had                  emphasised the importance of the continuance of the                  negotiations and had deprecated any action, such as                  the closing of the door, which might result in the                  negotiations breaking down.   On the same day                  (Tuesday, 16th. May) the Committee had met, and on the.                  following, morning he (Lord Halifax) had agreed with                                                                         y                  the Prime Minister the text of a draft arrangement                  between Great Britain, France and Russia which Sir                  Robert Vansittart might use  as the basis for his                  further talk with M. Maisky which the  Committee had                  agreed at their last Meeting should take place.                  The  document in question,  a  copy of which is appended                  to these  Conclusions, had been  drawn up on the general                  lines of  the Committee&apos;^ discussion on May 16th.                         The Foreign Secretary read to the  Committee  the                                                                      -A                  paragraphs numbered 1,2 and  3 of the document, and                  pointed  out that paragraph 3 had been  inserted to meet                                   -1-
Mr. Maisky&apos; s desire thai no door-si.CHiIi.be closed^,- Under-this paragraph consultation could take  place  as  to  thedesirability of the three Powers making declarations  inregard to the Baltic States.,       A second, meeting: between Sir Robert Vansittart andMo Mai sky had taker, place on the evening of Wednesday,May 17tho   At that meeting Sir Robert  &quot;Vansittart hadbeen careful to explain that he was acting in a  personal and not in an. official capacity, and  that he  desiredbefore sub.mitt.1ng  the proposals contained in  the documentto the Secretary of State.; to ascertain from  M.  Maiskywhether -those-proposals, would, be acceptable in Moscow.If M. Maisky could give him an  affirmative answer he  had some reason to believe that Lord Halifax would beprepared to give favour-able consideration to  the proposals.-       In the course of the conversation Sir  Robert had stressed the great importance of avoiding further delay in concluding the  negotiations-, and in  this connectionhad pointed out the delays and complications  which  mustensue if we tried  to cover too much ground at the outset.and the desirability of .,.lm:u.,:rag , the arrangements5,  inthe first place, to Poland and Roumanian  and  of  leaving the question of their possible extension to other countries to be discussed, in future.       Mo Maisky&apos;s reactions to the proposals had notbeen too unfriendly;  and he had undertaken to submit  themto Moscow forthwith.   He (the Foreign. Secretary) had ascertained that M. Gorbin had been using all his influence with MP  iviaisky in favour of the proposals andthat he had loyally done his best to persuade M.  iviaiskyto commend them to the favourable consideration  of his
Government.  M. Maisky had that morning informed theForeign Secretary that the proposals suggested oo himby Sir Robert Vansittart were not accept able to hisGovernment, and that the only basis on which the SovietGovernment were prepared to proceed was that of a TriplePact between Great Britain, Prance and Russia?    M.Maisky had asked that he might receive some message asto the decision of His Lajesty&apos;s Government before he left for Geneva that same evening, and Sir robert vansittart had undertaken that Mo Maisky should be given some reply but had, at the same time, pointed out thatin any event he (the Foreign Secretary) would haveopportunities of discussing the matter with Mo  Maiskyat Geneva.       The Foreign Secretary then referred tc TelegramNo. 233 of 17th.  May from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to turkey, and read to the Committee the following extracts from that telegram :-     &quot;(3) Turkish Ambassador, Moscow, explain          attitude of Soviet Government as follows :          (a) As regards advent to Russia through the              Baltic States he points out that Germany              could not attack Russia by this route              without Poland&apos;s acquiescence-  Soviet              request for guarantees as regards attack              through Baltic States is therefore some-              what in the nature of window dressing.          (b) Soviet Government nevertheless entertain              a fear, which they do not like to put into              words, of possible German attack g-ii              Russia with Polish co-operation.   It is              against this that they wish to be safeguarded.          (c) In general they desire complete reciprocity              of guarantee and they are animated by con-              siderable distrust especially where Poland              is concerned, though they hesitate to              admit it.
       (4) Turkish Ambassador,  Moscow,  makes personal           suggestion that situation might be met by-           some form of general declaration by His           Majesty&apos;s Government, French,  Soviet and           Turkish Governments that they would act           together &quot;in case of aggression&quot;.  Minister           for Foreign Affairs says that he has not yet           put this suggestion before his colleagues and           cannot say what their view would beHe (Lord Halifax) had considered whether there was anyway in which this fear of the Soviet Government (if itwas a genuine fear) could be removed.  It seemed to him that there were only two ways in which the situationenvisaged by the Soviet Government could arise.  In thefirst plaoe Germany might attack Russia through Poland          each ofor Roumania/which might be resisting the German invasionwith all her forces.  . In such a case we should be in thewar by reason of our guarantees to Poland and Sovunania-In the second case, Germany might attack Russia with the active assistance or the passive acquiescence of Polandor Roumania.  In such a case our guarantee to Poland orRoumania would not arise and what the Soviet Governmentwould be asking  us&quot; to do would be to guarantee to goto their assistance quite apart from any question ofPoland or Roumania, a thing which we had, up to thepresent, refused to contemplate.       (At this point the Oommittee adjourned for a        few minutes in order that certain of the        members might take part in a Division        in the House of Oommons).
       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat when analysed the alleged fears of the SovietGovernment, as set out in telegram No.233 from Angora,proved on one hypothesis to be groundless, because, inthe event of German aggression through a resistingPoland or Roumania, our guarantee would operate, and onthe other hypothesis would give Russia that complete and unconditional guarantee for which she was pressing andwhich we had, so far, refused to contemplate.   It waspossible that, as regards Poland, this telegram gave thereal reason why the Soviet Government were so anxious for a reciprocal arrangement with us.   It v/ould be observed that the Turkish Minister for Foreign affairs was convinced that the Soviet Government desired toco-operate with us, if only their suspicions and conditionscould be repelled.       The Foreign Secretary added that he had thoughtover the whole position and had come to the conclusionthat we were approaching the time when we should have todecide whether to accept the Russian terms or to rejectthem.   He thought that the Committee should not pre-judge this question or attempt to reach any decision upon it in advance of the meeting of the Cabinet, at whichit had already been agreed that the final decision shouldbe taken.   He suggested, however, that the committee might think it desirable that before any decision toaccept the Russian demands was taken we should consult with Powers such as France, Poland  and Roumania,which were closely interested in the decision.       THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to telegramNo. 307 from Paris of 18th May, which read as follows:-
      &quot;IMMEDIATE.           M. Bonnet begs me to tell you  that  the       French Government will be  very happy, should you       wish it, to support  at Moscow, the revised       formula that His Majesty&apos;s Government may decide       to propose to the Soviet Government&quot;.       What did this telegram mean?       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  saidthat he was uncertain what  the. telegram meant, but he himself had read it as a &quot;blank cheque&quot;.    M.  Corbin had told him that there was a great alarm in,the&amp;nce atthe cOJVt^nueKldelay in reaching some settlement; with  Russia, and thatthi-s delay was having a bad effect  in Germany  and  Italy,where it was being fully exploited.       THE PRIME MINISTER re-5d to the Committee a  t&amp;i^]^xaj&amp;*-JMejse&amp;gA Ho. 20? f3*om psu?is  or th-e 18tJx  May:       &quot;IMMEDIATE.            M. Bonnet begs  me to  inform you immediately        by telephone that the French formula for        assistance to or by Russia  in case of  any  change        by force to status  quo  in Central or Eastern        but?ope (enclosed in my  despatch No.  496 of April        24th) never was meant by  French Government to        apply to states other tiicm  J?oljaiiaa Ro-umania or        Turkey.           2.  French Government  never  meant this  formula        to apply to Baltic  States,  nor  do they intend it        to apply to the latter.&quot;       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  said that apart from objections on more general grounds, he  had always felt objection to the French formula because it involved us in indefinite and vague commitments relatingto  the status quo  in Central or Eastern Europe, and hethought that  if we were prepared  to go  as far  as this formula there was  very  great  force  in the argumentsput before  the  Committee  by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence  that  we might  as
well enter into a full-blown alliance with Russia -and.so obtain Russia&apos;s help if we were attacked by germany in the west.,       THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether the ForeignOffice had any reliable information in regard to therumours of a change in the Polish attitude to?/ards aTriple Pact between Great Britain, France and Russia.       SIR ALEXANDER CADOGAN said that there werevarious rumours to this effect but nothing definite orofficial.       THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had heard somegossip to the  effect that at a dinner party at thePolish Embassy Mr. Winston Churchill had said that hewas in possession of an important letter from Poland,which he proposed to read in the course of theParliamentary  Debate.   It was alleged that on the sameoccasion the Polish Ambassador had stated that so farfrom Poland being now opposed to a Triple Pact shewas really in  favour of it, but that it was necessary atthe moment to maintain a facade of disapproval.   Whetherthis gossip had any foundation or not, there could be nodoubt that the Poles were politically unstable andunreliable and it was for this reason that the russians were so intensely suspicious of them,       THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER enquired whether we had any reliable up-to-date information as to whatthe attitude of the Polish Government would now betowards a Three-Power Pact,   Would there be any objection to asking Poland to define her present attitude?   Only two answers to such a question seemed
possible.   Either Poland would acquiesce in the Pactbeing made, or she would raise very strong objectionto it.   If she adopted the latter course it would bea very seritfus thing for us to adopt a policy which involved the driving away of one ally in order tosecure another.   Had not the time come when poland should be asked for her  considered opinion on themattei4?       THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that both thePolish and Roumanian Foreign Ministers when in london had stated in private conversations with the foreign secretary and himself, that any close association between Great Britain and Russia, which would mean theassociation also of Poland and Roumania with russia would in itself precipitate a European war.   If thePolish and Roumanian Foreign Ministers had now changedtheir minds on the subject v/e certainly ought to beinformed.       THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE thought thatit might also be pointed out to the Polish and RoumanianGovernments that if no Three-Power Pact was made, russia might well gravitate towards Germany and would not sucha development, in their view, also tend to precipitate- a european war?       THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that the Polish and roumanian Governments should be invited to express their opinion on this point.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat everyone must recognise how serious would be the
consequences of a breakdown of the present negotiations.   On the other hand it must beremembered that the question of encirclement was atthe moment very much in the public mind, and itmight be difficult in this connection to estimatehow far public opinion would distinguish between theproposals which Sir Robert Vansittart had put to M.Maisky and the Three-Power Pact which the russians were demanding, and also how far the differencebetween these two methods would be regarded as justifying a breakdown of the negotiations.       On the previous day he, Lord Halifax, had hada long conversation with the German Ambassador who.had, in the course of it, referred to Herr Hitleras a reasonable and sensible man and said that no reasonabland sensible man would think of making war against theforces which Great Britain had (unjustifiably in-Germaneyes) mobilised against Germany.   These forcesincluded the whole of the British Empire, Prance,Poland, Roumania, Greece and Turkey, with the UnitedStates standing behind.   Whatever decision theCabinet might reach would not prevent Germany fromaccusing us of being the inventor and creator of theencirclement policy.   At the same time he had the strongest possible distaste for a policy which meantour acquiescing in Soviet blackmail and bluff .       THE SECRETARY&quot; OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs thought that, in regard to the question ofencirclement there was very little difference betweenthe Soviet plan and the Vansittart proposals.
       THE HO LIE SECRETARY doubted whether publicopinion in this country would detect any differenceat all.       THE PRIIIE MINISTER disagreed with this view,and thought that there was a fundamental differencebetween the two plans.       An alliance with Russia would constitute anentirely new factor., and would mean that the great powers would be lined up in peace just as they would balfour war broke out.   This, indeed, might be a decisivefactor with Herr Hitler.   There were many influentialpersons in Germany who were trying to persuade herr hitler that the time for him to strike was when the Three-Power Pact was concluded, and that the conclusion ofsuch a Pact would unite Germany as nothing else could do.
        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER agreed with the Prime uiinister.  Whatever we did we should neverstop the German propaganda on the subject of encirclement.He himself thought that British public opinion would appreciate the great difference between the Russian plan and the Vansittart proposals.        THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER doubted whetherHerr Hitler would see any difference between the two plans.Herr Hitler&apos;s abhorrence of the Soviet was &quot;based largely on  .  emotional and not on political or logical grounds.This being so, Herr Hitler would only see that we had made an arrangement with the devil and would pay no attention to the form and scope of that arrangement.        THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR DOMINION affairs thought that the important consideration was not whatthe effect of the arrangement would be on Herr Hitler&apos;mind,  but how it would be regarded by German publicopinion.        THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE pointed outthat the difficulty was that German public opinion wasbeing continually told that our policy was one of hostileencirclement and accordingly would pay no attentionwhatever to the method by which the alleged encirclementwas effected.        THE HOME SECRETARY added &quot;and if we failed tocome to an arrangement with Russia, the whole if germany would proclaim that the peace front had been broken.&quot;.        THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the Committee thatthere were still important moderate elements in germany which it was desirable to foster and encourage.   Hegreatly feared that an alliance with Russia would drive
these moderate elements into Hitlerrs camp,  and hitler would then be able, with some justification,  to say thathe had a united Germany behind him and could proceedwith his aggressive policies without fear of anyinternal dissentions.        THE HOME SECRETARY thought that this was amatter in regard to which it was very difficult toascertain the truth.  He himself was satisfied that theGerman Government would only be deterred by fear,  andthat when the emergency arrived the moderate elementswould disappear.        THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO thought that whatthe German Government really dreaded at the present time was the prospect of having to engage in war on two fronts.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER askedwhether we could be certain that the war would bemaintained on two fronts.   The lesson of the Treaty ofBrest-Litovsk must never be forgotten^        THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the decision onthe policy to be adopted must be reserved for theCabinet to take in the light of information to beobtained from Prance,  Poland and Roumania as to their actions on the Russian proposals.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER refer-red to the Russian fears of a German attack on Russiawith Polish co-operation mentioned in Telegram No. 233from Angora.  While these fears might have no realjustification, he himself believed that it would be ofgreat importance, if possible,  to remove them and thatthis would be a consideration which would weigh with
the Cabineto  He. suggested that when the Polish Govern-ment was approached they should be told about theseRussian fears and asked whether? in the circumstancesenvisaged, they would expect that our guarantee to poland should continue0        He had throughout been much perplexed by theRussian motives for insisting on a Three Power Pact.At first he had thought that these motives were merelymischievous cr based on a desire to make a good            it might  be  thatbargain, but  / the Russians were really animated byfear that Polish and Roumanian assurances given to ourselves and Prance were not mere!./ of no value so far as Russia was concerned but might be greatly pre-Judicial to Russia by facilitating a German invasionwith Polish and Roumanian co-operation .   He(Mr.  Morrison) had no doubt that if we entered into war with Germany because of German aggression againstPoland or Roumania, the whole iimpire would stand in with us, but he doubted whether this would be the case if we got involved in a war of aggression iby Germanyagainst Russia in which the other Eastern european countries were not involved^        THE HOME SECRETARY enquired whether this matter could not be brought under Article 16 of the covenant of the League,        THE SECRETARY OP STATS POR DOMINION APPAIRSsaid that he would circulate to the Cabinet the views ofthe various Dominion Governments in regard to theRussian proposalso        THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS was satisfied that a decision could be safely delayed until after his return nn May 23rd.  from Geneva.    There was                  -13-
no reason to suppose that the Russians would,  in thecircumstances,  resent a few days&apos;  delay.The Committee agreed :-(l) To take no decision on the latest     reply    reporting the views of the    Russian Government:(2) That a Special Meeting of the Cabinet    should be held to give further consider-    ation to the matter at 11 a. m.  on    Wednesday, 24th. May, the ordinary weekly    Meeting arranged for that date being    brought forward to 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday,    23rd. May:(3) That in the meantime the Secretary of    State for Foreign Affairs should take    steps to ascertain the attitude of the    French, Polish and Roumanian Governments    to the proposals put forward by the    Russian Government:(4) To invite the Secretary of State for    Dominion Affairs to circulate to the    Cabinet a &quot;Paper setting out the views,    so far as ascertained, of the Dominion    Governments in regard to the proposals    put forward by the Russian Government.Richmond Terrace,S.

t                 APPENDIX.       Proposals submitted informally       to  M..  Maisky by Sir Robert         Vansittart on 17th May.       Whereas  the  Governments of the United Kingdomand Prance have, by the declarations made by them on/dates of declarations about Poland and Roumania7, under-taken obligations in regard to certain Eastern european countries,       And whereas  the Government of the U. S.S.Ro have,on ^/jdate of declaration which, it is proposed, the U. S.S.R.should make about Poland and Roumania/&apos;, declaredthat..............................,       The undersigned, duly authorised to that effect,hereby agree as follows:-  1.   Since any action taken by the Government of theU.S.S.R. in accordance with the above-mentioneddeclaration could only be taken under conditions whichhad already involved the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and Prance  in taking corresponding action underthe declarations made by them, it results that the three governments will in these circumstances be engaged inthe common task of  resisting the act of aggression whichhad brought the said declarations into operation.   Beingthus engaged in-riiostilities in fulfilment of the above-mentioned declarations, the three Governments will giveeach other all the  mutual support and assistance intheir power.                                      i                                     j     -                                   7
-2-   2.   The three Governments will concerttogether as to the methods by which such mutualsupport and assistance could, in case of need,  bemade most effective,,   3.   The three Governments are willing toconsider in consultation the desirability of theirmaking similar declarations in regard to other european countries.   Should any such declarationsbe made by the three Governments as a result ofsuch consultations, the provisions of paragraphs 1and 2 above will apply, and in the event of an aotof aggression which brought the said declarationsinto operation, the three Governments, being thusengaged in hostilities in fulfilment of the saiddeclarations, will give each other all the mutualsupport and assistance in their power.
