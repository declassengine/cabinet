[This Doctunent is the Property of His Britannic MajestVs Government, i g 5 ?.    Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1931.SECRET.CABINET.AIR  ROUTE  TO  INDIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I am in general agreement, with the clear and impartial statement of the case contained in Lord Amnlree&apos;s memorandum circulated as CP. 183 (31). But I feel it incumbent on me to urge on my colleagues further consideration of the possibilities offered, on the Persian side of the Gulf, and the strong objections which exist to the Arab side. I am in entire agreement with the Air Minister as to the importance of maintaining the air route to India. I equally recognise that we may in the last resort,If we can make no progress with Persia, be forced to adopt the Arab route. But I am not satisfied that, we have yet reached that point.2. I wish, in the first place, to emphasise the political objections (o the Arab route. I need not develop them in detail, for they are concisely stated in para. 7 of Lord Amulree&apos;s memorandum. But I would ask my colleagues to recognise that our responsible political advisers with first-hand knowledge of the country and of the individuals concerned warn us of the great political risks involved. The Government of India, whom I haA^e consulted, and who have traditionally been responsible for the area in question, are in entire agreement with these views. We cannot ignore the fact that if we decide to develop a civil air route on the Arab side, we must be prepared to contemplate, either immediately or at a later stage, active armed intervention. We must further be prepared to contemplate a flagrant disregard of the rights of the small communities affected.3. In these circumstances, it is essential, in my view, before we commit ourselves in any way as regards the Arab route, further to consider the possibilities in Persia. Clearly the best route of all is that at present flown by Imperial Airways along the Persian shore of the Gulf. The Foreign Office consider that we have no hope of securing any extension of the present permit, and they are reluctant on political grounds even to broach the subject with the Persians. I recognise the objections to raising the question of the Gulf route with the Persian Government until we have exhausted the possibilities offered by Central Persia. But I am not satisfied that we have yet exhausted these possibilities, and it seems to me that some, at any rate, of the difficulties of making a direct approach to the Persians about the Gulf route would disappear if we were to adopt the slightly different course of action which I recommend below.4. What I wish seriously to urge in these circumstances is the importance of reopening officially with Persia the question of the Central Persian air route offered to,us by the Persian Government, viz. by Salar on the upper reaches of the Karun River and across the Bakhtiari mountains to Ispahan, and thence to Yezd, Kerman, Bam, Bampur, and Gwattar. I am far from satisfied with the manner in which this question has so far been handled. I have read both the report of the pilot who was commissioned to undertake the survey and the relevant despatch from the Minister at Tehran. The Minister at Tehran &quot; endeavoured to make Mr. Travers realise the advantages to be gained from the political point of view of avoiding Persia altogether,&quot; and remarked, according to Mr. Travers&apos; report, that &quot;Imperial Airways were merely pandering to Persia&quot; in surveying it. Mr. Travers, the pilot in question, actually flew over onlj&apos;- 110 miles of the route (on the Bakhtiari section west of Ispahan). It seems to me impossible in these circumstances, as proposed in Lord Amulree&apos;s memorandum, to notify the Persian Government, who are fully aware of what has taken place, that &quot;a careful survey has now shown the Central Persian route to be impracticable.&quot; Assuming that the difficulties on one section of this route are insuperable, we ought, in my view, again to approach the Persian Government, point this out to them, and ask them to suggest, or ourselves suggest, an alternative.   If they refuse to considerCopy No.203      100   7.81
an alternative, or if careful reconnaissance of the alternative allowed shows that it is definitely impracticable, I can see no reason why we should not then press officially for an extension of our permit to fly the Gulf route. Persian refusal in such^ciicnm-stances to grant such an extension would surely not only be difficult to reconcile with the continuance of normal friendly diplomatic relations between bur two countries, but would expose her to adverse international criticism. I find it difficult to believe that the Persians, who are, after all, members of the League of Nations, whose credit is in an unsatisfactory condition at the moment, and who are peculiarly susceptible to a Press campaign in this country, would be likely to adopt a wholly unreasonable attitude or to inform us that we must either fly the Central Persian route which they have so far indicated to us, and which their own Chief of the Air Staff described as impossible commercially, or abandon Persia altogether.5. It would clearly strengthen our hands iu discussing alternative routes,through the interior of the country with the Persian Government if we had :ourselves investigated possible alternatives, so far as we can on the material available, and formed our own conclusions about them. T should like to suggest in this connection immediate consideration, before any formal approach is made to the Persians, qf flying from Baghdad either via Kermanshah and Uamadan and thence to Ispahan and Gwattar, or even as far north as Tehran and then south to Ispahan, &amp;c, which would be only 200 miles longer than the route indicated by the Persian Government. I recognise that such a line would take longer to fly and would be more expensive to work than the existing route along the Gulf. But this is equally true of the proposed route along the Arab littoral. The Central Persian route, difficult as it may be to organise, has none of the political objections which exist on the Arab side of the Gulf. As between the two, the advantage seems to me most definitely to rest with further exploration of the possibilities offered by Central Persia.6. While action on the lines set out above is being taken with Persia, I.should see no objection to such steps as are possible without prejudicing the main question or raising political difficulties being taken for the preliminary organisation of a route along the Arabian coast, and I would suggest that the lines which this might follow could best be considered inter-departmentally between the Air Ministry, the India Office, and the other Departments interested. But the objections of principle referred to in para. 2 of this memorandum are such, in my view, as to make it undesirable that any final decision should be taken without further consideration in the&apos; Cabinet in the light of the result of the further discussions with the Persian Government which I have suggested above.7. The course of action I would urge in these circumstances is the following : (a) That Imperial Airways should be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government, with a view to making a further approach to the Persian Government, consider it important that the possibility of flying via Baghdad-Kermanshah-Ispahan and so south-east to Gwattar, or alternatively Baghdad-Kermansliah-Tehran-Ispahan-Gwattar, should be further investigated so far as possible in advance of an actual survey of the whole of such a route.(b) That the Persians should be told that a preliminary flight by a representativeof Imperial Airways has shown that the practical difficulties involved in the section Salar to Ispahan of the route proposed by them are insuperable for a commercial company such as Imperial Airways, and should be asked to allow an alternative to this section of the route, and to give facilities for its investigation, and for the further investigation of the route Ispahan-Gwattar by a representative of Imperial Airways, accompanied, if desired, by a representative of the Persian Air Ministry.(c) That if the Persians refuse to consider any alternative route across CentralPersia, or if the routes suggested prove impracticable after a- careful reconnaissauce, they should again be pressed officially to renew our permit to fly along the Gulf route.(d) That in the meantime discussions should be initiated between the AirMinistry, the India Office, and other interested Departments as to the organisation necessary in connection with the Arab route, in case we should ultimately he forced to fall back upon this, and to force the hands of the Arab rulers concerned, such discussions to be, however, without prejudice to the general question involved.India Offick,&apos; 2-1 tli July 1931,AY.
