THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.secret .Copy No,5.p.195(51)&apos;Conversion of Terminals at Collieries and private Sidings to enable them to accommodate 20 ton Wagons.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.Last December, approval was given to the proposals made in a &quot;Memorandum submitted by the First Lord of the Admiralty that grants should be made under Part I of the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act, 1929, towards the cost of approved schemes financed by railway companies for the conversion of terminals at collieries and private sidings so as to accommodate 20 ton wagons.      Subsequently, in reply to the question in the House of Commons on the 17th December, I made an announcement to this effect, indicating that the proposed grants would have a present value equivalent approximately to 505C- of the cost of the works.      The Mining Association, the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers and the Federation of British Industries were asked to bring this offer to the notice of their members with a view to their submitting applications for grants through the railway companies, and similar steps were afterwards taken as regards the principal Electrical and Gas Associations.      The response to this offer has, however, proved very disappointing and no applications for grants have yet been received by the Development (Public Utility) Advisory Committee.From recent enquiries it appears that the position so far as the railway companies are concerned, is as follows:-
- 2 - &apos;London and Horth-Eastern Railway. Company, have nothing before them except one or two tentative inquiries which are not likely to lead to anything at present.     It is not thought that in present financial circumstances, definite applications are likely to come forward, but it is thought that there may be applications when trade revives.Great Western Railway Company, have not so far received applications.London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company, have received two applications which are being examined and inquiries in regard to the operation of the scheme have been made by several other traders. Southern Railway Company, are not aware of any applications and consider it unlikely that such applications will be received so far as they are concerned. In order to bring the position again before the traders and to emphasise the nature of the grants available and the expenditure which would rank for grant, I have recently had the attached explanatory statement prepared and circulated to the Railway Companies and the principal industrial associations concerned, asking the latter to bring it to the notice of their members.      This statement should make the position clear to the traders and while, under present conditions, a large response can hardly be expected, I hope that if trade improves sufficient schemes for the conversion of terminals will be put forward to justify the arrangements made.(Intd. ) H.M.
aj u VGovernment grants in aid of expenditure on conversion of traders terminals to accommodate 20ton wagons.As announced &quot;by the Minister of Transport in the House of Commons on 17th December, 19J0, Mis hajesty&apos;s Government are prepared to make grants under the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act, 1^29, in aid of approved expenditure on conversion of traders terminals to accommodate 20 ton wagons on a scale which represents approximately ^OJc of the total cost of the work.Applications for grant under these arrangements must be made through a railway company with those system the traders&apos; works are connected.     Approved expenditure will be financed in the first instance by the railway Company, subject to repayment - as indicated in the example below - over a term of 15 years.The following imaginary example may make clear the financial provisions of the arrangements.A trader decides to put in hand works for conversion of terminal accommodation to permit of use of 20-ton wagons costing  10,500.      The Railway Company concerned advise that  500 of this cost is not eligible for government grant either,(a) because it is not &quot;necessarily incurred as a result of conversion of existing facilities to deal with 20 ton wagon traffic&quot;;    or(b) because it represents a &quot;renewal which would in any case have to be carried out at an early date&quot;.The  500 has therefore to be borne directly by the trader.The balance of  10,000 is financed in the first instance by the Railway Company and (assuming that it is all expended within one accounting half-year) the payments to be made half-yearly by the trader in each of the 15 years are made up as follows:
