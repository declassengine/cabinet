(THIS    DOCUMENT IS. THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;1 S GOVERNMENT)CABINET,Secret. C.Pa166(3i5CHARING QROSS BRIDGE SCHEME, Memorandum by Minister of Transport;Copy NoIn my memorandum to the Cabinet of 16th May lastj, 0oP* 131(31 )g I explained the position with regard to the Charing Cross Bridge Schemes, arising cut of the Report of the Advisory Committee a pointed by the London County Council9 under the Chairmanship of Sir Leslie Scottg KoCg to advise on the best-scheme for a new rosd bridge and approaches at Charing Cross,The London County Council addressed a letter to me on 29th April asking (a) for my general views on the Report of the Advisory Committee^ and (b) whether if the Council should decide to proceed with a scheme based on the findings of the majority of the Committee they could depend on my approval and support and on a grunt of 76 per cent of the cost from the -Road FundaIn pursurance of the decision arrived at by the Cabinet on 3rd June I caused a letter to be sant in reply to the effect that before expressing any views on the points raised i-i their letter the Government would desire to be informed of the conclusions which the Council had themselves reached on the report of the Committee^ and of the Council&quot;s decision as to the scheme which should be adopted a
Since that date the Improvements Oommittse of the Council have examined the Reportv and the matter is to he considered by the full Council at their meeting on Tuesday next, July 7th.     There can be little doubt that the Council will adopt the recommendation of the Improvements Committee that a Bill .be promoted In the next session of Parliament to give effect to Scheme NoB6 which was recommended by the majority of the Advisory Committee^ provided that a grant from the Road Fund of per cent of the cost is guaranteed by the Government0In view of the ne::.r approach of the summer vacation a very early decision on the point will be required., if the London County Council, are to be in a position to introduce the Bill in he: it Pariiamentgry Session.As I explained In my Memorandum of 18th May, Schema Ho66 recommended by the majority of the Advisory Committee embodies all the essential principles of the-scheme which was rejected by the Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1930-   The msin differences are set out In aa Appendix to this MemorandumaThe net cost of Scheme house 6S after allowing for recoupment9 is estimated at &amp;ig8970s00Q somewhat more these the cost   ISgSOOgQOQ)   of the scheme whioh was embodied in the Bill of 1930.1 am advised that there are probable economies which should reduce the net cost by more than  500,000. This saving is due to the possibility of avoiding any interference with the India Stores Depot.
A grant of 75        cent from the Soad Fund would therefore amount to a sum of about  -9*5759^0 spread over a period of several years?     It should ba pointed out.,, however.; that the V/satminater 01 ty Council have ooneist-ently opposed any scheme fair a nesr road foricigc at Charing Cross which aid not provide for the inyprovetient of the northern &quot;approaches the.widening of Str v&amp;artln9s L&amp;n&amp;o It would? probably, therefore^ be necessary in order to xaeet the opposition or ths ^ejatiiaingitep City Council to enter into a farther commitment la respacjt ofthe QQGt of improving the approaches to the &quot;bridge&apos; on thg north 8ids0The position of the Southern Railway Company has also to be considered.,     The Company had given their reluctant o on seat to the scheme embodied in, the London County OounoiX (Charing Cross Bridge) Bill of 1950, Tsfclefc like the scheme H006 now under dlsoussion involved the removal of Charing Cross Station to the south tide of the rivers but their consent had only been given on an assurance 02k the part- of the last (lovemment that an additional fertuge at Charing Cross v?as a matter of national.urgency ano. that the removal of the station vt0.&amp; vital to any euoh scheme oI have no official information as to the attitude which the Southern Railway Company are likely to adopt to Scheme ]foo6* , but their representatives on the Advisory Committee strongly opposed ito     They Justified their change of attitude by stating that in accepting the Parliamentary scheme of 19^0 they had been led to believe that tins removal of the station to the south side of the rlv^r was vitals whilst
othe evidence before the Advisory Committee had shown that there were two possible way b of constructing a road bridge without interfering with the railway station,,     There has also been some agitation on the part of the looal authorities on the south of the Thames., twenty-five of which have passed resolutions protesting against the proposal tsto close Charing Cross Station and to erect in its place a terminal station on the south side of the river Thames&quot;.At the same time if the London County Council were to promote a new Bill based on Seheme  fo06c and were to schedule to that Bill the agreement reached with the Southern Railway Company in 1^01 the Company might find it difficult to maintain their oppositionoIn my Memorandum of l6th May I suggested that pending a decision on the part of the London County Council 3 the Treasury would no doubt consider the financial aspect of the matter as the (government must obviously be in a position to give the Council an immediate reply should they ask for an assurance of a grant of 75 PQr centoAs compared with l;?j50 the financial position of the country has become more grave0     Provision has bad to be made in the Finance Bill of the present year for the Road Fund to borrow up to a sum of s^8000^8000 in order to meet the additional commitments which the Fund has assumed owing to the acceleration of road and bridge works for the mitigation of unemployment*     It is therefore a serioue matter to assume a further commitment of about  12% millionso
I may point out that after the rejection of the Bill hy the Selection Committee in 1930s, I caused a letter to he addressed to the London County Councils, pointing out that the Government could not he committed &quot;by any recommendation of the Advisory committee and that     the position would need to he reviewed afresh in the light (in particular) of the position of the Road Fund at the timecOn the other hand if the Government decline to give an assurance of adequate financial support the Bill will certainly not he proceeded with.,     The probable effect of the government a refusal will be a decision on the part of the London County Council to pull down Waterloo Bridge and to replace it by a new bridge capable of carrying six lines of traffic     Political capital will he made out of this, and on the Government will be placed the odium of having blocked a great scheme of development and at the same time of having assisted in the destruction of what is in some quarters held to be an &quot;architectural masterpiece&quot;oIn any case a decision as to the fate of &quot;Waterloo Bridge cannot be postponed much longer,.     The old bridge has now been resting on temporary supports for seven yearss and the annual expenditure on its maintenance is about  J9000oThe temporary works supporting the structure have been in position for a much longer period than is desirable on engineering grounds, and every delay postponing the date when the permanent works can be taken in hand will add to the engineering risks attending all such works0     The cost of reconditioning Waterloo Bridge in accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic is estimated at  946s,000o     The cost of building an entirely new bridge to take six lines of traffic would not greatly exceed that some
4i h)  J,(Intldo) Ho]jfcth July, 1951oIf the London County Council decide to promote a new Bill criticism will, as before , centre round the lay-out of the new station on the south side-     Scheme Ho, 6 still involves stretches of viaduct on the south side, though less than under the Parliamentary scheme of I95O0Furtherj X confess to some concern at the possibility that future developments in the direction of electrification or the linking up of terminals as a result of the proposed &quot;pooling&quot; arrangements under the London Passenger Transport Bill8 may eventually render practicable the construction or an underground stations with its attendant advantages in the form, for examples, of the elimination of viaducts,,Any decision must take account of the following o ons i de r a t i on s s(a) the ability of the Treasury at the present timeto enter into so large a commitment(b) the dangers, on the other hand, of missing theopportunity presented by the faot that the London County Council are prepared to proceed with this great improvement(c) the odium that may attach to the Government ifWaterloo Bridge is pulled down as a result of the refusal of the Government to support the schemes   personally I have always thought that, apart from aesthetic considerations, the bridge was a hindrance to navigation, was inadequate for modern traffic requirements, and that it was imeeonomieai to spend nearly as much money in reconstructing it for four lines of traffic, as would be necessary for the construction of a modern bridge capable of carrying six lines.
