This document is the property of His Britannia Majesty1 s Government.SECRET . Copy No . J.......CP. 178(31). CABINET.REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE   (No.2) BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I have made further enquiries as to the procedure under the Parliament Act and I think that my colleagues may like to have the following information as to the position regarding this Bill.There are two contingencies which have to be  taken into account  -(a) If the Commons disagree to the Lords amendments and if the Lords do not insist on their amendments,  the Bill will pass in the ordinary course this Session;(b) If the Lords insist on any of their amendments to which the Commons disagree, recourse must he had to the procedure under the Parliament Act.As I explained to my colleagues at the meeting ofthe Cabinet on the 14th instant,  there are certain administrative amendments involving no question of principle which - owing mainly to the time the Bill has taken to pass through Parliament and to the impossibility of removing from the parliamentary register now in course of preparation the names of business premises electors - require to be made in certain clauses of the Bill as it left the House of Commons.I need not trouble the Cabinet with the details of these amendments and it is sufficient for present purposes to explain that the object of three of them is to postpone temporarily the coming into operation of three clauses, while the object of the fourth amendment is to insert in the Bill a schedule setting out the constituencies exceeding in area 400 square miles in which the limitation on the number of motor
cars that may be used at an election will not apply. The House of Lords has already approved a suggestion by Lord Passfield that  such a schedule should be inserted in the Bill if Clause 6  (which is the clause proposing restrictions on the use of motor cars at elections) were retained.One of these amendments, viz. that postponing until the next General Election the reduction in the scale of candidates&apos;  expenses, will be  proposed by the Government in the House of Lords on Third Reading.      I have satisfied myself that the proposing of this amendment  (whether or not it is accepted by the Lords) does not in any way effect the position under the Parliament Act.The other administrative amendments relate to clauses which have been deleted by the Lords,  and Parliamentary Counsel advises that the position with regard to these amendments is as follows  :On the assumption that agreement between the two Houses is not out of the question and that the Bill will pass this Session, the procedure will be that the Commons will disagree to the deletion by the Lords of the clauses in.,question,  and, on so doing, will propose  (as consequential on the restoration of these clauses to the Bill  ) the administrative amendments which it is desired to make in the clauses.      The Commons make no alteration to the Bill itself, but send back to the Lords a statement of their &quot;Reasons for disagreeing to the Lords Amendments&quot; and of amendments which the Commons propose in consequence of the restoration of the clauses to the Bill.      If the Lords accept the restoration of the clauses, they will presumably accept the amendments proposed by the Commons to the clauses,  as these amendments involve no question of principle.If no agreement is reached between the two Houses,steps/
steps will have to be taken to pass the Bill by means of the Parliament Act.      In that case,  it will be impossible to get the amendments made this Session.      This being so,  the Bill must next Session be sent up to the House of Lords in exactly the same form as that in which it was sent up this Session,except for including any amendments made-by-the Lords- his......Session which the Commons accept,  and the Commons will then be able under the proviso to subsection  (4) of Section 2 of the Parliament Act  (quoted as a footnote) to suggest the amendments which they desire without inserting them in the Bill;    if these amendments are agreed by the Lords, they can then be inserted in the Bill when It is sent up to the Lords in the third Session.I should be glad if the Cabinet would decide whether-they wish to press the issue between the two Houses of Parliament to a conclusion before the House adjourns for the Summer recess.J oR .C .HOME OFFICE:17th July,  1931Provided that the House of Commons may,  if they think fit, on the passage of such a Bill through the House in the second or third session,   suggest any further amendments without inserting the amendments in the Bill,  and any such suggested amendments shall be considered by the House of Lords,  and,  if agreed to by that House, shall be treated as amendments made by the House of Lords and agreed to by the House of Commons;    but the exercise of this power by the House of Commons shall not affect the operation of this section in the event of the Bill being rejected by the House of Lords.
