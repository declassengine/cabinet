(P.) 50.]Resolutions adopted at the Tenth Meeting held on Wednesday, July 15, 1931.IT is suggested that the aim of the United Kingdom Delegation at the Conference on Disarmament should be to carry out the principles set forth below. The occasion and method of their presentation, whether before or during the Conference, whether at Plenary Meetings or in Committee, whether after preparatory conversations and soundings, or otherwise, are matters to be decided* Annexed hereto.[5783]
by the Government and the Delegates with due regard to all the circumstances of the moment.1. The Delegates should base their policy on the recognition by all States Members of the League of Nations, emphasised in the case of those that are parties to the Treaty of Versailles and the Final Protocol of the Locarno Conference, that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforce-ment by common action of international obligations.* They should, at the stage they deem appropriate, declare our readiness to fulfil our Treaty commitments and insist that they constitute an obligation of honour for all the signatories of these Treaties.2. The Delegates should make a full statement of the reductions already effected by the United Kingdom, and state that any further reductions by us must be part of an international agreement. The Delegates will bear in mind, also, that the possibility of keeping our armaments at their present low level may have to be reconsidered unless there are comparable reductions by other Powers.3. In considering the armaments of particular nations, the aim should be a reduction of armaments to such a point as will ensure for all nations a reasonable security. To reach this objective, successive Conferences should be held at intervals, at each of which a further stage in the reduction of armaments would be reached. The military forces of nations, whether personnel or material, available on the outbreak of war, should be limited in such a way as to make it unlikely for an aggressor to succeed with a knock-out blow. By this means an opportunity would be given for the various methods of conciliation and pacification to be brought into play.4. In determining the limit to be fixed for any country, account must be taken of its circumstances political, geographical and international. In the first stage of what is intended to be a progressive policy of international disarma-ment it is necessary to take into account considerations of security and the bearing thereon of recent history. Allowance, for example, should be made for the circumstances of a nation like France, which has been twice invaded and once devastated within living memory, and is naturally suffering apprehensions for its security which cannot be allayed in a short time. It is no less important that Germany should be given security against invasion by her neighbours, who, collectively, are at present in a position to overwhelm her.5. The principle of combining security with limitation of offensive power raises two aspects of disarmament, namely, (a) its total amount, e.g., total sea, land and air forces; (&amp;) the specific character of the armaments, including range and destructive capacity.6. The most successful methods of disarmament that have as yet been evolved are those adopted in the Disarmament Clauses of the Peace Treaties, which require to be supplemented by some form of budgetary limitation. The Delegates should aim at the application mutatis mutandis of similar principles to the general reduction and limitation of armaments, and should support the principle that the same methods of Disarmament should be applied to all nations alike. This should not involve the increase of the fighting strength of the disarmed Powers, but rather the reduction of the armaments of others. The elimination or limitation, as the case may be, of weapons as provided in the Peace Treaties is important and should be pressed by our Delegates as generally applicable. The system of supervision accepted in the Disarmament Treaty, which should be on some such lines as those proposed in the Draft Convention, should replace the methods of supervision in the Peace Treaties.7. The Delegates should reaffirm our desire to see conscription abolished. If, as is probable, its abolition should prove impossible, other methods must be found for the limitation of effective strengths of land and air personnel, and consequently of their reserves.8.   Full information as to reserves of men and material should be published.* Particulars of the Various Declarations are attached in the Appendix.
7059. The Delegates should keep in view throughout the idea of gradually leading nations to rely for their security on the obligations undertaken by all the nations of the Conference to renounce war as an instrument of policy and to seek the settlement of disputes by none&apos;but peaceful means. Until these engagements are accepted at their face value disarmament can never be complete.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 16, 1931.APPENDIX.1. Article 8 of the Covenant.The Members of the League recognise that the maintenance of peace requires a reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations.The Council, taking account of the geographical situation and the circum-stances of each State, shall formulate plans of such reduction for consideration and action by the several Governments.&quot;2. The Treaty of Versailles, Part V.&apos;&apos; In order to render possible the initiation of a general limitation of armaments of all nations, Germany undertakes strictly to observe the Military, Naval and Air Clauses which follow.&quot;3. The Section of the Reply of the Allied and Associated Powers to the Observa-tions of the German Delegation on the Conditions of Peace, dated June 16, 1919.&apos;&apos; The Allied and Associated Powers wish to make it clear that their require-ments in regard to German armaments were not made solely with the object of rendering it impossible for Germany to resume her policy of military aggression. They are also the first steps towards that general reduction and limitation of armaments which they seek to bring about as one of the most fruitful preventives of war, and which it would be one of the first duties of the League of Nations to promote.&quot;4. The Final Protocol of the Locarno Conference, October 16, 1925.&apos;&apos; The representatives of the Governments represented here declare their firm conviction that the entry into force of these Treaties and Conventions will contribute greatly to bring about a moral relaxation of the tensions between nations, that it will help powerfully towards the solution of many political or economic problems in accordance with the interests and sentiments of peoples, and that, in strengthening peace and security in Europe, it will hasten on effectively the disarmament provided for in Article 8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.They undertake to give their sincere co-operation to the work relating to disarmament already undertaken by the League of Nations and to seek the realisation thereof in a general agreement.&quot;
