DOCTMKNT^IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BBITAMHIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) RETCAB I NET, --------------9(51). Copy No3 0CHARING GROSS BRIDGE, SCHEME,MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP TRANSPORT.1.     At their meeting of the 15th July the Cabinetaccepted the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer thatthe economic situation was.so serious that there could &quot;beno question at present of incurring any Government expen-diture on Charing Cross Bridge.2.      I have now received a letter from the LondonCounty    Council, a copy of which is attached, stating thatthe Council at their meeting on the 21st July passed aresolution to the effect that the Council would be pre-pared to promote a Bill in the next Session of parliament for the construction of a road bridge at    Charing Gross,with approaches and general lay-out on the north and southsides of the river in accordance with scheme No.6 recom-mended by the majority of the Advisory Committee preside over by Sir Leslie Scott, provided that the Governmentwould agree to contribute from time to time   75 per cent.of the expenditure incurred on the Scheme and on the reconditioning of Waterloo Bridge.    The letter concludesby asking formally for an undertaking from the Governmenton this point.3,      In pursuance of the Cabinet decision I proposeto reply to the following effect(a) Remind the Council that at the time when their previous Charing Cross Bridge Bill was rejected by the Select Committee of the House they were Informed that the Government would be prepared to support them if they decided to move the recomaittal of the Bill.
(b) When the Council decided on the alternative^ course of appointing an Advisory Committee to recommend &quot;an agreed scheme&quot; for a new road bridge at Charing Cross they were informed that view of the large traffic and financial considerations involved, the Minister must be free to consider any scheme recommended by the Advisory Committee on its merits and to examine it from the financial aspect, taking into account the position of the Road Fund at that time.(c) The scheme now recommended by the AdvisoryCommittee is not an &quot;agreed scheme&quot;, and is still, in fact, the subject of acute con-troversy.(d) Future events,  such as a rapid development inthe electrification of main line railways, may profoundly affect the considerations which would determine the lay-out on the south aide of the river.(e) The Council are aware that the resources of the Road Fund are insufficient to meet the heavy commitments undertaken in connexion with schemes for the improvement and construction of roads and bridges in all parts of the country, and that powers have accordingly been taken in this year&apos;s Finance Bill for advances to be made to the Fund from the Exohequer up to a sum not exceeding  9 millions to meet the expenditure falling due during the current financial year.(f) The Government have carefully reviewed theposition, and in view of all the circumstances including the present serious economic situation they regret that    they are unable at the present time to renew.the offer cf a 75 per cent, grant from the Road Fund towards the oost of a new road bridge at Charing Cross.4.      I seek the formal approval of the Cabinet tothe despatch of a letter to the London County   Councilon the lines indicated above.24th July, 1951.(intld. )    H.M.
