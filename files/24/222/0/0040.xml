4P** 63 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.. 190 (31). COPY NO.    5STATE OF TRACE - JUNE 1931.Memorandum by the ^President of the Board of   Trade.(From reports made at the meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council held on July 9th).General satisfaction was expressed at the Hoover moratorium which appeared to have an immediately salutary, if only spasmodic, effect in restoring a measure of confidence throughout the country,.    Apart from this, however, it is not possible to record any general improvement in the industrial situation during June,.     Unemployment increased, exports again showed heavy declines by comparison with last year, and the indications as to the future course of trade and manufacturing activity were on the whole not encouraging.The actual increase in unemployment during June was 35,000; the number wholly unemployed was practically unchanged, the increase in unemployment being confined to men temporarily stopped.     Among the latter the increase was in fact 50,000, chiefly in coal mining and in the Midlands and North Eastern Divisions and in Wales;    this increase was offset by a fall in the number of women out of work chiefly in the North Western Division.If we take May and June I9.3I together and compare them with May and June 1930,  so as to include the Whitsuntide holiday in both years, exports declined in value by 32.5% and imports by 30.7%.     For the six months the figures were,  exports 34.6% and imports 22.8%,,     As regards volume, imports of food during the first half of 1931 were somewhat greater than in the first half of 1930,  imported raw materials declined by about 10$ and manufactured goods by over 5?j.     On the whole    the volume
of imports was thus practically the same.     Exports declined Tby about 28% in volume.Railway traffic continued to fall at the rate of almost ICfi both in tonnage and value even compared with the depleted traffic of this time last year, but a more hopeful note was struck in the week ending July 4th, the total decline being only 6%;    the decline in merchandise alone was 10%, which is a considerable improvement on the month of June, and the decline in coal and coke was only 1s?/j.     The railways are conducting an enquiry into the extent of road traffic competition in this and other countries and the preliminary figures show that the loss to the railways in passenger revenue has been in the United States 24%, in this country 19y*, in Germany 10%,  in Switzerland 7s% and in Prance and Belgium practically nothing.Employment, production and exports all declined in the coal mining industry last month and there were no signs of improvementc     On the home market the glut of small coal due to the general industrial depression which was referred to last month continues and it was represented that the minimum prices as at present determined for the various classes of small coal prevent individual collieries from selling off this coal at any price they can get.      In some cases therefore stocks are accumulating.     That coal for export is in a much worse position than coal for the home market is illustrated by the fact that, while the total tonnage of coal and coke conveyed by rail during the 5 weeks to the end of June was 6.9% less this year than last year,   the fall in coal for shipment taken separately was 16.9%. This period of 5 weeks includes V/hitsuntide in each year;    the actual export figures for May and June together show a reduction of 20%.     Pear was expressed that some system of coal import licences might be introduced into Prance.      (This has now been confirmed;    it is understood that licences become operative for imports by land from Juliy 20th, and for imports by sea from July 27th).
In the Iron and steel Industry there was little change in employment during the month.   The June figures of output are not yet available, but it is expected that they will be below those for May and will compare very unfavourably with those for June last year.    The Hoover proposals, however, gave rise to a somewhat more hopeful tone and resulted, on the Continent, in a welcome rise in prices - steel bars and joists for example rose in the last fortnight of June by 3/6 and 2/- per ton respectively; the maintenance of this improve-ment will depend upon whether the International Cartel succeeds in preventing a corresponding increase in production. The slump in British exports continues, however, and British prices remain very much above those charged for foreign steel. On this latter point negotiations have now been entered into with a view to enabling the shipbuilders to  secure a larger share of the small world business available.There was no improvement in the shipbuilding position last month.    It is reported that the Portuguese Government have placed orders in this oountry for 4 torpedo boat destroy-ers and 2 naval despatch boats and that a contract for the reconstruction of two Blue Star liners at a cost of  200,000 has been awarded to the Tyne; but these orders appear to be the only new business of any magnitude and the shipping position remains as serious as ever.   The freight index fell nearly 8 points to 80.5 (1913 s lOo) after rising steadily during the last few months and the returns of laid up tonnage received to date suggest that the total for July 1st will not be less than that for April 1st.Unemployment again declined in the engineering industry and the list of contracts obtained during the month   is smaller than usual; it includes an order for machinery for the Russian Timber industry valued at  100,000.Non-ferrous metale benefitted from the general market.
improvement, but only in the tinplate trade and to some extent in spelter does increased activity appear to have been sustained.The report from the motor industry indicates that there is unlikely to be much activity for the rest of the season but is otherwise a little more hopeful.     In the home market the decline in production and sales continues,   though considerably less in proportion than the decline in the American industry.     The light truck section on the other hand is actually flourishing and thiB type of motor vehicle is making very rapid progress.     It is expected, moreover,  that a reduction in piece rates amounting to 6-7%, which was agreed upon as from July 6th, will materially assist the industry in meeting competition.     As regards exports, the demand in Dominion and Colonial markets, though substantially below last year, shows marked improvement so far as the British share of the total is concerned;   for example, whereas this country provided 35% of the motor vehicle imports into New Zealand last year, up to the present this year we have provided 60%.Unemployment increased slightly in the building industry and on June 22nd stood at 18,6%.     This is particularly disappointing as in May and June unemployment in the building industry should be at its lowest point.     Some relief is expected from the Housing (Rural Authorities) Bill.There was a further fall in employment in the cotton industry where the situation is reported to be uniformly gloomy.     Employment also declined in the woollen and worsted industry, and machinery activity is very low even allowing for the usual seasonal delined   the world supply is so much above demand that the strike which has new been in progress in Prance for some weeks has had no apparent effect on the industry here.     The further decline in wool values was
checked by the announcement of the Hoover moratorium proposals after which more business was done.     Reference was made to the collapse of the large German woollen and worsted amalgamation (N.W.K.) and the opinion was expressed that whenever ration-alisation has been tried in this industry, whether abroad or in this country, it has failed - partly because, for one reason or another, the experiment has not been a fair or full trial, but partly owing to the dependence of the product upon fashion and individuality of design for its sale.Reports from the hosiery centres differ somewhat, but it is evident that although there have been seasonal improvements in some districts there has been no general change for the better.     It seems clear also that the real silk section is on the whole keeping its position better than the other sections. The export markets continue depressed and have probably fared worse than the home market.As regards other industries, no improvement of business is reported in the chemical industry and the consumption of dyestuffs last month again declined.     Russian competition in heavy chemicals is complained of both in the Par East and India and in South America.     There was no change during the month in the rubber industry and the production of boots and shoes is affected by the usual summer slump.     As an example of British effort to capture foreign trade may be cited the report that some Midland firms are to take up the manufacture of women&apos;s plaited sandals, at present probably a continental monopoly.There was little change in the price of wheat during the month and the market is so overstocked that the adverse official report of the probable Canadian new crop failed to have any effect on prices.     It is reported that acreage for the new crop is being reduced both in Australia and the Argentinej    at the moment the wheat trade is active in
40 Q 0 0Argentina.     In Australia, where trade is for the time being inactive, a Bill was introduced on July 7th to establish a system of State Wheat Boards with power to buy and market wheat within the State and with representatives on a Commonwealth Wheat Board which in turn will control export and interstate trade in wheat and flour, etc., by licence. Judging by Russian charterings for the Autumn, there may again be large exports of wheat from that country but no definite information is yet available.     In India prices for wheat have been fairly well maintained probably because the lower price has led to increased local consumption;    this has made export business difficult.The departmental and the co-operative stores again report, *that, though their money receipts have declined, the quantities of both food and merchandise going into consumption are on the increase:    for example the quantity of butter sold by the Co-operative Societies last month compared with June, 1930, showed an increase of 14.6$, of bacon and ham 14.9$ and of tobacco 25.4%, but at the same time their total money receipts had declined by 11%.      If food is excluded the quantities sold (in May - the latest figures available ) show a small increase in the South and a fall in the North.     There was a further slight deline in wholesale prices during June the index falling by .7% to 62.1$ (1924 ? 100) .There v/as an excess of short term credit throughout the month of June with the result that Bill and discount rates remained at low levels notwithstanding the financial difficulties on the Continent, first in Austria, then in Germany, which had a very disturbing effect on the market.
Towards the end of the month the announcement of the Hoover proposals coupled with the strong holding of gold by the Bank of England, which increased during the month to  163,000,000, did much to remove anxiety for the time being.W.G.Board of Trade, 25th July, 1931.

MEETING OF TKJj B CARD OF TRADE ADVISORY OOUITCir,.Thursday, 9th July, 1931./At the commencement of the meeting it -^as agreed that the next meeting of the Council should take place on Thursday, August 6th, and that there should he no meeting in September, reports for August being sent in to the Secretary between September 1st and 10th/,CHEMICALS.DR. CLAYTON.    There is no improvement in business to be reported.      There is still little indication of any general improvement in the sale of alkali products.     Sales in China have been checked by the threat of fresh disturbances, and the comparatively heavy sales made early in the year are not going into consumption very rapidly.      Imports of Russian caustic soda, and soda ash, are an increasing danger, and larger tonnages are coming forward.      In Japan, Russian caustic is competing strongly, and consumers are beginning to realise that, whatever its quality, it is good enough for many purposes,     A fairly high level of alkali sales has been maintained in india    the Russian competitive products are making their appearance via Germany, in some cases being marked as of German origin.     Sales in South America continue at a comparatively low level.     Russian competition is increasing in this market also, further shipments of alkali having arrived in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, while reports from Chile indicate impending competition from the same source.     There are some indications of increased demand for bleaching powder during the last three weeks, particularly for export.      The demand for acids is still slack.Complete results for the Fertilizer Year 1930/31 are not yet to hand, but, as reported last month,* it is anticipated that sales of ammonium sulphate will show a decrease in comparison with the previous year, the reduction in United Kingdom sales being in the neighbourhood of ten per cent.     Business in Spain has been quiet, and the persistence of the drought, combined with further depreciation in the value of the peseta, has resulted in the decreased demand for prompt delivery.     Vith regard to China, sales in the Shanghai district continue to be satisfactory. Sales in South China have been affected by the large quantity thrown on the market towards the end of last year, and by the relative cheapness of Bean Cake, propaganda against chemical fertilizers being active.     lJrices in Japan have declined somewhat of late.The month under review shows a further decline in the consumption of dyestuffs.     A slight increase in the demand for acid wool colours, and a substantial increase in that for basic colours and vat colours, has been offset by decreases in other groups.      Trading in direct cotton colours, so far this year, has been slack in comparison with last year.     There has been some increased consumption by the paper trade, but with the exception of miscellaneous colours, the demand for dyestuffs by most consuming trades compares unfavourably with that during the early part of last year.*See A.C.  224, page 28
CORRIGENDUMPlease substitute the following new page for page 2 as circulated with the minutes:-Refined tar for roads appears to have been a very mixed market, some distillers still reporting favourably on their disposals, while others have found at least no improvement on previous years.     Light oil fractions have continued in reasonably good demand in most directions while the pitch markets seem to have been subject to no appreciable change.The position of fine chemicals is very much as in previous months in both home and export business, all at an unsatisfactorily low level for the time of the year.     The essential oil markets ih this section stand out, however, as having been the subject of quite an appreciable interest, and while some lines have been weak as regards prices,  the general tone has been steady and verging towards improvement,PRESIDENT,     Dr. Clayton, you had a passage there relating to Russian supplies marked as of German origin,DR. CLAYTON.     That is so, the stuff was going to India, I can if you wish make some further inquiries,PRESIDENT.     Mr. Lindsay, have you any legislation in India corresponding to our Merchandise Marks Acts?MR. LINDSAY.     Yes, Sir, we have to the extent that we punish false indications of origin.     We do not insist on the application of marks of origin to all goods, or to any classes of goods;   that is to say, any classes of goods are allowed to come in without question if they bear no indication of origin, but if they bear any marks which give an assumption as to the country of origin, and that assumption is false, we should insist on a counter indication.     So that any Russian goods coming in under a German mark would be penalised if it were discovered.It is extremely difficult to say where any goods are made. Prom the analysis we have a pretty good idea that it is Russian. It certainly was not made in one of the regular German Y.orks. It may have been bought and repacked in Germany.MR. LINDSAY.     It is not for want of good-will that the Indian Customs do not detect all false indications like that, it is probably from want of the details of the test, and if we could have the test to send out to the Customs people in India, I am Bure they would be very glad indeed to apply it.DR, CLAYTON.      I will take that up, and communicate with you.WOOL.ALDERMAN TITTMRINGTON.     The wool-textile industry has remained extremely quiet for most of the period which has elapsed since our last meeting, and there has been a decline in machinery activity, as a whole, which is partly seasonal.     Prices showed a downward tendency until the Hoover proposals, which coincided with a stiffening of values and the transaction of a fair amount of business in fine tops.     Up to the present, the response in yarns and fully-manufactured goods has been very slight, but it is satisfactory that the deoline has been checked.     The fourth series of London Wool Sales for the current year opened on
S  7 aJuly 7th with a general decline in values in comparison with the closing rates of the preceding series in May.   The decline, however, was not so great as had been anticipated, having regard to what had occurred in the various consuming centres during the interval between the two series.   The prolonged strike in Prance reduced the demand for wool from that country, whilst Germany was a cautious buyer:   but Yorkshire buyers were very active.     The prevailing opinion that wool prices are on a low and reasonable basis was reflected in the better tone of the market.   From the strike in the French textile industry, very little benefit has been felt in this country, but I am told that Germany has been more active as a result of the stoppage of French machinery.In our own industry the wages question was in a somewhat nebulous state until yesterday, and although, up to that time, the Trade Unions had received no official notification of the fact, it was understood that the Employers&apos; oroposals have been modified, and instead of a 14.6 per cent, reduction, they will endeavour to enforce now an 11,7 per cent, reduction.   The Employees&apos; side of the Joint Industrial Council made a formal application for a meeting of that body to consider this position.   The full details are in this morning&apos;s press, and it is sufficient to say that it is obviously the intention of the Employers of the industry to endeavour to enforce a reduction of 11.7 per cent, for the whole of the trade.    The Employees&apos; organization is to meet on Saturday, when the whole matter will be considered, but as Chairman of that Association, I am not at liberty to make any further statement. I will submit the general statistics in the usual course.-fcMR. BEAUMONT PEA01. Is there any further information in regard to the big German failure? Is it likely to affect the English industry at all?MR. HAMILTON.    It will affect it to some extent, but I imagine that most of the competitors will be   French and German,CO-OPERATIVE TRADE,MR. VARLEY.    Go far as the sales of goods in the Co-operative movement on this side are concerned, we are still receiving less money for more goods.   During the month, as compared with twelve months ago, our money values have gone down 11 per cent, on a business of nearly six million pounds.   The quantities are -   with the exception of tea, a rather notable exception - very much up. For instance, butter is up 14.6 per cent, bacon and hams 14.9 per cent., grain 25.7 per cent., tobacco 25.4 per cent,   fhe one that I am a bit concerned about - and I cannot give an explanation -is that tea is down 914,600 lbs. or 20 per cent, on the month, compared with a year ago,    bo far as butter is concerned,  the speculative interest usually shown in Denmark about this period of the year has been lacking, and, in consequence, markets have ruled on the quiet side, with a slight tendency to lower values.   During the month, Danish has declined 3e.6d., Swedish 6s., Finnish 3s,6d. and New Zealand and Australian also 3s.6d.   Canadian has only recently made its appearance   after many years, and is turning out an excellent quality a-c a reasonable price, and many of our Societies have turned attention to this in preference to !?ew Zealand and Australian,    Irish Creamery moves very slowly, owing to the high prices being asked for this class.   Vith regard to sugar,
A fi 1s -J Lithere have &quot;been steady to firm markets during the past jShth, only one advance of 3d. per hundredweight having taken place, That is not because of a change in the statistical position, &quot;but is generally thought to be because of the Hoover offer.   The trade is exoecting the improvement to continue.In dried fruits the market continues quite firm.   The selection of Greek fruit is diminishing, and a little more interest appears to be displayed in new crop Australian.   Reports about the new Greek crop still speak of a 25 per cent, reduction owing to early frost damage.    In regard to suitanas, in the absence of Smyrna fruit, new crop Australian are filling the demand for best trade.    There are still fair supplies of old crop Australian available, but the quality, generally, is very poor.   Californian is in fair demand.   The reports of the new Smyrna crop are far from encouraging, but it is too early to speak with any certainty about the prospects.In the tea market, there has been some irregularity during the past month.    There was a good general demand at fully firm rates for all descriptions, excepting where quality was inferior.   Later, however, offerings were well in excess of demand, particularly so with plain, indifferent, low medium Ceylons, &quot;and the market, suffering in consequence of the long sales, became irregular with a drop in price of common grades and medium descriptions.   Good liquoring teas, however, found a strong market and realised firm to harder prices, really fine teas of outstanding quality being now particularly scarce as the Indian crop is at the end of the season and   Ceylon tea inferior in quality.   Towards the end of the month a distinctly better tone prevailed all round, and prices ruled generally steady with an advance in price in common tea.   For fine tea, the competition was strong, and&apos;the market closed with a firm to hardening tendency.As anticipated the low prices created a fairly good clearance of bacon and ham, and prices were advanced to the extent of 5s. per hundredweight on June 2 tl*.   Too much reliance must not, however, be placed on advances being maintained, as supplies of both pigs and bacon which have been held back for an advance, will now come forward, and the market may once again suffer from over production.The stock of old crop English potatoes has been cleared at very high prices.    It has been a good season for Jersey potatoes. Prices maintained a reasonable level, and farmers will have had a profitable season.   Markets on this side were not too good, cool wet weather during the first three weeks of the month affecting the demand.   Disease appeared in late shipments.English and Guernsey tomatoes have now come down to reasonable price levels earlier than usual.In the soft fruit, English growers will receive only poor prices for strawberries.   The quality generally has not been too good on account of lack of sunshine.     Continental fruits were in normal supply.The market for wheat declined for near positions, but advanced for distant, the main influence being a little more confidence on the p*&amp;rt of speculators.    In the United States President Hoover&apos;s proposal to suspend Var &quot;Debt payments for twelve months made speculators think a recovery of values in all directions would result.    This improved the tone of the Stock Exchange and commodity markets, but as it did not increase the
trade in actual wheat the effect will probably be temporary.    In Canada, bir Josiah Stamp&apos;s&quot;Royal Commission reported that trading in futures was in the interest of the grower, and in these circumstances not much change in the method of marketing seems likely.    It may be below the normal on this account,,    The Russian offerings    for August, September and October shipment seem to indicate that they are preparing for a fair movement if the chartering of steamers means wheat shipment.    I have no official information.   We have   a Deputation out in Russia at the moment investigating the position so far as wheat is concerned,  and they have not returned,  and I have no knowledge of their findings.    In Australia there are good supplies available, but they are renorted to be reducing acreage for the new crop.   Argentine continues selling,  shipping and meeting competition.   A smaller acreage is expected to be sown for the new crop.In maize very large supplies are available in the Argentine, and the prices being low Europe will probably buy freely.    This will be good news for feeders and farmers, and may keep food supplies down to reasonable prices.With regard to the Drapery Department,  it is difficult to do business, but the quantity of twelve months ago is being maintained in bulk.    The raw material prices have today less effect than ever in the direction of determining sales of the finished goods, which are often offered at prices out of all keeping v/ith the economic level.    It depends very largely on the desire for money,  and the person who holds the stocks at the moment.In woollens and readymades,  a very substantial increase is shown in the season&apos;s orders as compared with those booked for the corresponding period of last year, but,  whilst not wishing to appear unduly pessimistic,  it is unlikely that such progress will be maintained.    The general demand is for a cheaper grade of goods.In boots and shoes,   the depression in trade continues,  and has almost reached a serious position.    Prices are stationary, but the economic conditions are forcing the demand for much cheaper classes of goods.    This is having a serious effect on factories which manufacture the better class articles.    Bo far the outbreak of foot and mouth disease has not affected the supplies of hides, which are slightly increasing in value.The general furnishing trade still continues fairly good, although buyers are not placing their usual stock orders, but ordering in smaller quantities to meet their requirements.    There have been no further reductions during the month of June,  although it is understood that many qualities of carpets will be reduced in the near future.As usual there have been small shipments of goods to our corporate organizations in all parts of the world, the amount we shipped to Russia, for the month being 554,861.   Prom July 1st, 1950, up to the 8th June last (and that will be practically the end of the cereal year, which is the 50th June), Russia exported 1,853,005 tons of grain, of which 1,032,702 was v/heat.MR, HAMILTON;    Does Mr. Varley expect to have his Renort from the investigator who has gone to Russia by next month&apos;s meeting?
MR. VxJRLuiiY.   I expect so, but I am not sure.      Things are just a little bit dixiicult in   Russia, anti I give you the best information I have each month;   but so far as I know -outside our own Report - there will be large exports of grain, but I   would rather depend on our own Report than on the newspaper reports, which are so often wrong with regard to Russia.MR. HAMILTON.   Russian exports are smaller than have been anticipated?MR. VARLIiY.    No, they are really larger than we anticipated at first,      I think I told this Committee a year ago that there would be an exportation of a million tons of wheat this year. Last year (i.e. the cereal year just ended) there were six million more acres of land given over to the cultivation of wheat than the year previously.      I understand, but this is unofficial, that ihere are larger quantities this year than last year.MR. LINDSAY.    But about the same export?MR. VARL1JY,    For the cereal year just ended the export has increased from last^year.MR, LINDSAY.    Have you heard that the Russians admit that the exports of present harvest - that is to say, during the season beginning July 1931 - will probably not exceed exports during the past season?MR. VARLJY.    I have no confirmation of that and before I express an opinion, Mr, Lindsay, I would rather have the Report of our own Deputation.      Then we will have the facts before us.MR. CAIRNS.    i*s indicating the present extent of the productive side of Co-operative trade in Scotland, it may be stated that the wholesale value of the goods manufactured during the past twelve months by the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society amounted to 55,793,827 which is 32.76 of the total sales.The average number of persons employed in the various factories was 6,933.     The average capital per employee was  169,7.6d.  and the average amount of production per employee was S835.13.9d.During the year there has been no notable addition to the number of industries, but it was recently decided to engage in the manufacture of linoleum, and plans have been adopted for a factory to be erected at an estimated cost of 5120*000.     A novel feature about this enterprise is thst the Co-operators of Sweden and of Norway have made requests to be allowed a financial interest in it, and have offered to -provide a substantial amount of the capital and to share responsibility for the results.    They regard this as an alternative to building a factory for themselves in Sweden, and doubtless they have conceived tho idea from the existence in Stockholm of a Co-operative factory for the manufacture of electric lamps, which, after being erected and conducted for some time by the Swedish Go-vperative Wholesale Society, is now being transferred to a federation of which the constituents are the Co-opurative Wholesale Societies of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland.     The Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society does not require to be assisted with capital, but the proposal to make the linoleum factory an International Co-Operative- concern is being considered as regards its compatibility   ith the Industrial and Provident Societies *%ct of this country.
Distributive co-operative trade in Scotland measured in cash down for goods is still recording a decrease, probably of 7 per cent., on that for the corresponding period of last year, though the primary articles of consumption show no diminution in the quantities sold.Then, our sales of tea are keeping up and though it would almost appear from Mr. Varley&apos;s statement that the people over the border are drinking something other than tea, at least we are selling just as much tea as ever.During the month of June the butter market has been remarkably steady and for five successive weeks the official price of Danish remained unchanged.     Production in Denmark shows a large increase, but consumption has also been on a large scale, stimulated no doubt by the comparatively low price at which butter can be retailed.     Arrivals of Colonial butter are now lessening owing to the advanced period of the season, and at the same time the demand for it is not so strong sinoe its price approached that of Danish.The make of Scotch cheese, Cheddars and Dunlops, will, it is thought, be equal in quantity to that of last season, but the prices are Cheddars 33 per cent, and Dunlops 27 per cent, lower than those for the same period of last year.There has been little change in the position of Scotch Oats, supplies are scarce, but with the arrival of large quantities of oats from Canada, Russia and Argentina, any considerable advance in the price is barred.Rice, has been remarkably cheap, Rangoon 2-Star established a new record by sinking to  6.13.6d. a ton in Glasgow, a price hitherto unknown to the trade.Prem time to time I have reported on the position of the Milk Pool.     This has been an interesting experiment, and then we have an intimate connexion with them, but let me say firstly, that although supplies of milk are very plentiful, the difference is fourpence per gallon between the price of milk for fluid consumption, and the price for cheese-making.     Now, the total quantity of milk handled at present by the Pool averages 39,800 gallons daily, of which no less than 23,500 gallons is surplus to local requirements, and has to be sold at a manufacturing price. Such an unfavourable distribution of sales involves the Pool as compared with the Non-Pool farmer in a heavy loss, and the management of the pool has now decided to issue a circular to the Members requesting them to state whether or not they desire a continuance of the organization.The yrice of wheat has shown little change in the course of the month.     Our wheat buyer in Canada reports that serious damage has been caused to the growing crop by drought, and that according to the expectation of the trade little more than half the quantity of last year&apos;s crop will be harvested.     Indeed, an official report was Issued on these lines last Saturday, and would, in ordinary circumstances, have given prices a heave up, but there is so much wheat in sight, coupled with the probability of huge shipments from Russia when the new crop is ready, that the market was wholly unresponsive to tho news of the Canadian shortage.During June the sales of coal by the &quot;Wholesale&quot; Society was 27,841 tons, of which the average price at the pit was 17s.l^d. per ton.     This represents an increase of 6,755 tons on the quantity for the same month last year.     But throughout the month
the weather was exceptionally wet, which helped to add to the sales, hut the main factor in producing the increase was that the Retail Societies were accumulating coal against the possibility of a stoppage this month.On June 16th, five days later than last season, there was begun the lifting of the new crop of Ayrshire potatoes.     The weight of the crop is disappointingly light, the average at the moment not being more than five tons per acre.,     Evidently the unfavourable weather since the middle of May has retarded growth. The price has fallen from  20 per ton on June 16th   to  12 per ton now.MR. LINDSAY,,    I should like to know whether there is any evidence of a fall in the price of tea in the most popular lines.MR. VARLEYs    I think there has been a tendency since the abolition of the duty for more of the cheaper tea to be sold. Of course the duty always operates more against a cheap tea than a tea of a higher quality, and I think that has been our experience, that we are selling more of the cheap tea.MR.  LINDSAYS    That is my point, Sir, that one would have thought that the demand for the cheaper teas would have increased, and yet one finds that the cheaper teas are losing their place on the market;    it is the commoner types that are in less demand, apparently, and the better types which are maintaining or even improving their position.      There seems to be rather an inconsistency there which I do not quite understand.MR, VARLEY,    That would be more the Indian tea rather than the Sumatra and Java tea?MR, LINDSAY.    Yes, the finer grades of Indian tea are improving their position, and the worse grades are finding it very difficult to compete with Java and Sumatra?MR.  VARLEY.    That is so*EMPLOYMENT.MR. HILTON*    The number unemployed has increased by 35,000 during June.      That usually happens at this particular time of the year.      If you take the seasonal trend, the familiar, recognised, almost traditional trend of -unemployment, it rises during January; it comes down a little erratically during the spring to the month of May, then it takes a turn upward and rises a little until the autumn when it keeps   steadier for a few months and then goes up again after Christmas.,     That is the ordinary seasonal t rend that one knows so well,    . During last year there was a steady and continuous rise in unemployment, throughout the whole year, so that all seasonal movements were obliterated by this steady ascent. That reached its topmost mark about January and February of this year, and examining the figures for the present year it almost looks as though the familiar seasonal trend has repeated itself this year at just twice the level that we were accustomed to previous to January 1930*     The graph, so far as it is drawn, is almost exactly for this year the seasonal, the ordinary seasonal; graph, but it is twice as high as it was prior to January 1930, when the new phase of unemployment set in.
This increase during June was an increase almost entirely in the numbers temporarily stopped.      In the first week of June there was a slight improvement due to people going back after the extended Whitsuntide holidays, then the decline in employment set in again,  and the fact that the additional 35,000 is almost entirely persons temporarily stopped indicates to my mind that there is an extension of the range of unemployment - I mean the range in industries trend.     There was an increase on the register of 50,000 men, and that is balanced by a decrease of sometning over 11,000 women, but that is naturally associated with the fact that in the North-Western Division there was an improvement in the state of trade, a slight improvement.     All these figures are very small relative to the total number of unemployed.As regards the Divisions, I have already said that unemployment was down for the month in the North-western Division;    it was dovm also in the V/estern and the Southern Groups, and it was down in Scotland.     There were increases, on the other hand, in the Midlands, in the Norrth-liastern Division, and in Wales.Over the period 18th May to 22nd June employment declined in coal-mining, engineering, and in the cotton and wool textile industries.     There was little change in     iron and steel, and ship-building and ship-repairing, and unemployment increased slightly in the building trade and decreased in the distributive trades.As regards the number of insured persons in employment at 22nd June, the numbers are estimated provisionally to be about 109,000 less than on the 18th May - that is a little more than a month previously - and about 578,000 less than at 23rd June, 1930 - that was a year previously.COAL.Mr. B..JNT0N JONMS:    I will hand in a statement in the same form as usual.*     Apart from that there is very little more to say that would be of interest,     Production keeps at a lew level;    exports show a decrease of one and a half million tons in May this year as compared with May of last year, which represents a fall of about 30 per cent.     The inland demand, although it has fallen, has not fallen to anything like the same extent as the export trade.      It causes considerable embarrassment because it occurs in one particular direction, that is in industrial requirements, and in industrial requirements the fall in the demand is most marked, of course, in the iron and steel trade all over the country, and in the cotton trade in Lancashire,      The classes of fuel which these trades use are small cpal, and the over-production of small coal presents a considerable problem because you have to produce small coal in definite relation to other classes of coal which at present have a higher demand.     A lot of it is being put on the ground at considerable exx^ense to the colliery proprietors, and perhaps a more serious aspect than that is that the stocking of this* See page 39 -9-
coal in large quantities makes a call on the liquid financial resources of the colliery companies at a time when those resources are not very great.     Unless there is some improvement in this demand for small coal, it looks as if the demand for small coal is going to regulate the production instead of the machinery which has teen set up by the Coal Mines Act of 1930. However, no doubt that difficulty will be overcome in some way. The point to emphasise is, some sort of revival in the iron and steel trade and the cotton trade is a matter of very great importance - a revival at a very early date for the coal industry.PRESIDENT.    Could you tell us anything at all, Mr. Benton Jones, about the general level of your inland prices say within recent months?MR,  B1JNT0N JONES.    I cannot say that they have been raised -I have not got statistics for all over the country, but I can say I think, that they have been maintained in the district in which I am mainly concerned.      I think it is safe to say that prices have been maintained, and the prices for the smaller classes of fuel are being maintained at a higher level;    in fact, that has some influence upon the embarrassment which the small coal affords &quot;to the coal industry.      Before minimum prices were fixed the colliery company having a surplus of small coal could go into the wilderness to find somebody who would take it away at a low price, or at practically no price at all, who would take it off his hands,  in order that he need not stock that coal, but now that minimum prices are enforceable the colliery proprietor is not able to do that, and the reaction is that he has it in stock instead of getting somebody, either a consumer or someone near a consumer, to take it off his hands.PRESIDENT.    Do you not classify small coal?     Is not that one of the possible classifications under the Coal Mines Act of 1930 for price purposes?MR. BENTON JONES.    I do not think you could say that small coal would be considered as one class, because there are so many varieties of small coal, both as regards quality and as regards size, but all. the various sub-divisions of coal are classified at one various price;    the price is applied to the several classes.PRESIDENT.    It seems to me, Mr. Benton Jones, remembering the Act, that you have a protection surely as regards price for all classes of coal, if the owners and these organisations in the different districts choose to make it effective, and that would apply to small coal as well as to any other classes of coal.MR. BENTON JONES.    You mean, Sir,  that if the colliery proprietors cared to do so they could fix a proper price for small coal?PRESIDENT.    Yes,MR.  BENTON JONES.    That is so.MR. VARL3Y.    In domestic coal is it the fact that usually in summer time the prices come down and this year they have failed to come down?
PRESIDENT:   Well, I suppose Mr. Benton Jones would say they do fall to some extent.MR. CAIRNS:    They have not fallen this year, Sir.PRESIDENT:    No, but as I read the working of the Act, it has supported the price to some extent during the present summer, the pit head price of coal.MR. BENTON JONESi   Yes,  that is so.MONEY.MR. BEAUMONT PEASE:   Usually at the &quot;beginning of June there are ample funds available in the Money Market owing to the disbursement of dividends on 5 per cent. War Loan, and this is usually followed after about ten days with a certain tightening up of the market, but this last June short credit has been super-abundant throughout the whole month, and has been obtainable at If per cent, down to one per cent, outside the Clearing Banks.   At the   turn of the month a small amount was available at 2 to 2^ per cent.    The result of this excess of credit was to weaken bill rates during the early part of the month.The Market generally has been very much disturbed by the rapid development of financial difficulties on the Continent. At the end of May the crisis in the affairs of the Austrian Credit-Instalt, which was known to be in difficulties,  and the repercussions elsewhere,  caused other financial centres on the Continent - Berlin and Hungary,  especially in Berlin - to suffer very heavy withdrawals of foreign credits and balances. The Bank of England came to the assistance of the Austrian National Bank, who had come forward to support the position reported by the Credit-Instalt, and the Bank of England made an advance of , 4,000,000 on the understanding that this loan should be repaid subsequently by the proceeds of an issue of Austrian Bonds which they hoped to be able to bring out later on.    Further assistance was given by a discount credit of  20,000,000 which was granted by the Bank of England, the Bank of France,  the Bank of International Settlements,  and the Federal Reserve Bank of Few York.    That discount credit was put at the disposal of the Reichsbank, whose stock of gold and exchange reserve had been greatly depleted by the constant withdrawals from Germany, in spite of the protective measures which they had undertaken by putting up their bill rate from 5 to 7 per cent, on the 12th June.    That made the London Market regard things with a certain amount of caution, and in the second week in June the bill rates rose to 2-3/16 per cent.As far as the Bank of England is concerned, apart from  6,400,000 gold which they received from Berlin,  the Bank has increased its stock of gold by pxxrehase in the open market of  2,200,000, besides receiving a considerable amount of sovereigns from the Cape, and by the release of gold earmarked for the Argentine.    The result is that the total stock of gold at the Bank of England on 1st July was  163,000,000, showing a very strong position.Then later on in the month, on the 20th June, the Market received the news of President Hoover&apos;s proposals for the postponement for one year of all payment of war debts and
reparations.   This led to an immediate rise in Stock Exchange values, which has since been fairly maintained. These proposals,  coupled with the Bank of England&apos;s large stock of gold, had the effect for the time being of removing some of the anxieties in the minds of the Money Market, and a possible fall in the Bank Rate in the near future was freely discussed, with the result that discount rates fell again to 2 per cent, and in a few instances business was done below that figure.At the end of June the Stock Exchange and the Money Market were anxiously awaiting the result of negotiations between Paris and Washington on President Hoover&apos;s proposals in the hope that Prance would come into line with the other creditor countries.    To-day this hope has been largely realised, but the position still remains very anxious and complicated, and it is very desirable that further withdrawals from Germany should cease, otherwise the difficulties and dangers of the situation will be accentuated.    There has been a tendency in the last few days   for creditors of Germany, and those who have deposits and credits in Germany,  to take advantage of the slight amelioration of the position, following on President Hoover&apos;s proposals, to withdraw their deposits and their credits.    Obviously if that- goes on the rate will again decrease and a very serious position will arise.   There are various Conferences going on at the present time to meet that difficulty, but what the outcome will be I cannot say.MR, VARLEY:    Gould Mr. Beaumont Pease tell us what are the probable results of the renewal of the payments when they come to be made a year hence,  together with interest?MR, BEAUMONT PEASE.   Well, my own personal belief with regard to that is that the present difficulties will to a large extent be renewed.MR. VARLEY.    Then, unless the present movement is a gesture, and an indication of something greater ooming forward within the next twelve months, we are likely to receive ho benefit from the present gesture.MR. BEAUMONT PEASE.    I do think the world generally will receive some benefit.    It give   a breathing space for Germany to hold the situation and to meet her difficulties, but personally I do not believe it is sufficient in itself.MR. LINDSAY:    I take it these withdrawals are really due to fear, they are not made because the   Americans really want their money back to use?MR. BEAUMONT PEASE:    I think it is psychological, but I do not think it is altogether due to America.    There is the drop in the German National Mark, also withdrawals of the smaller banks on the Continent generally.   My information, for v/hat it is worth,  is that that withdrawal of funds from Germany by the bigger banks,  certainly in this country,  is comparatively slight, but Germany is in the dangerous position of working on short-credits and deposits on short terms which are liable to be withdrawn at any time on the expiration of the date at which they were fixed.-IS-
RAILWAYS.SIR RALPH WEDGWOOD:    Taking, the period, Sir, up to the end of June, railway revenues were still falling at the rate of about 10 per cent, on thoso of the previous year.   That has been the rate of fall on the small goods, and it has continued subject to one qualification which I will refer to later. The actual fall in tonnages, taking the three principal -railways for the same period, five weeks, to the end of June, has been in the higher class of merchandise 12.8 per cent., in the lower class merchandise 19.7 per cent, and coal and coke 6.9 per cent,, and the shipment of coal, which is included in the figures of coal and coke I have given, fell 16,2 per cent. There is one feature, however, which may be held to show better things, or may be merely a flash in the pan, that is that the returns of revenue for the week ending 4th July, show a distinctly better state of things; the fall as compared with the previous year, instead of being 10 per cent,,   hae come down to 6 per cent.   Goal receipts are down by If- per cent, merchandise, taking all classes, are down 10 per cent and passenger traffic 5 per cent.   It remains to be seen whether the diminished rate will continue.Taking individual trades there is nothing special to comment on, I referred last months to the fishing trade; inthe fishing centres there is a good deal of pessimism aboutthe future, and trawlers are being laid up in good numbers.It hae been reported that there has been a large import of potatoes from the Continent to East Coast porte.American tourist traffic is showing a big falling off.As regards unemployment, the railway shop staff is 6S per cent, on short time at the present time.The railways have been carrying out lately an investigation as to the effect on the railways of road competition in foreign countries as compared with this country.   The investigation is not complete and a good many of the figures are obviously mere estimates, hardly suitable for putting to this meeting.    It may, however, be of interest to give some of them which have emerged up to the present.   The general position is that road competition is much worse in the United States than anywhere in Europe, and it is much worse in Great Britain than on the Continent, that is from the railway companies1 point of view.   Taking the loss in passenger revenue over a particular period, the United States shows a loss in revenue of 24 per cent,, Great Britain 19 per cent., Germany 10 per cent,, Switzerland 7^ per cent., and it is reported that in Prance and Belgium there has been practically no loss in passenger revenue,   No estimate has been obtained as regards the&apos; loss in goods traffic due to road competition. Taking the actual number of vehicles, passenger cars and private cars, there are 1,101,000 in Great Britain against 1,688,000 in Prance, Germany and Belgium.   Those three countries together have about 50 per cent, more than Great Britain.When you come to passenger carrying vehicles it is very different.   Great Britain has 52,000 buses and Prance, Belgium and Germany together have only 48,000, indicating that theu &apos;-&quot;...............- &quot;-H -...........---------....................  .....................................-.   ii -* See A.C. 224. Page 11.
- competition on the road by means of passenger buses is very much less on the Continent than it is in this country.In the matter ef freight competition, the position is not so dear.     The number of lorries in Great Britain is 337,000 as against 562,000 in Prance, Germany and Belgium.     It seems fair to infer that in the matter of competition in freight carrying,although it is probably more intensive in this country than in the other countries, the difference is not so marked.WOOLLEN AND WORSTED INDUSTRY.MR. HAMILTON:   My report runs on very much the same lines as that of Alderman Titterington,     The average machinery activity taken ever the week ending June 6th was 64.7 per cent., being a reduction of 1.4 per cent,  on a month ago.     Last year no census was taken at this time, but about two years ago the corresponding activity was 74 per cent.     We have no exact records but it is very doubtful if the activity in the black mid-summer of 1921, as the result of the great slump, was as low as at present, and&apos;in, the meantime much machinery has been destroyed. There is still -a lack of confidence in wool values, reflected in the fall in prices of 5 to 10 per cent, at the London sales which opened this month.     The wages dispute referred to in last month&apos;s report^ has not yet come to a head,     3mployer3 have reduced their claim for wages reductions from 14.6 to 11.7 per cent,  and a number of firms - how many it is difficult to ascertain - have been working on the reduced scale for the past week or two.     The usual machinery for regulating wages appears tr have broken down, and isolated arrangements between individual firms and their employees are taking its place.In the Roubaix district of France a general strike or lockout has been in force for many weeks, the reduction in wages claimed there being 10 per cent.     Up to the present foreign competitors seem to have derived no benefit from the French strike, a fact which was equally noticeable in the case of the Yorkshire strike last year, the reason being that the supply of textiles exceeds the demand In such a degree that the elimination of even the largest competitor fails to create anything in the nature of a shortage.      In Germany the situation in the woollen and worsted industry is extremely critical. The N.W.K., perhaps the largest amalgamation of its kind in the world, is in a parlous financial condition.      Its 100 Mark shares, quoted a few years ago at over 200 Marks, now stand at 6   to 7 Marks, and a crash which will affect German banks and other industries, as well as a large number of foreign creditors, seems inevitable unless fresh capital can be brought in.     Up to the present rationalisation on a large scale has in every instance brought disaster in its train when applied to the wool textile trade.That report was written yesterday, and in two instances it requires a little revision.     The wages dispute seems more likely to come to a head, and with regard to this big German wool concern, the N.W.K,, I think it is pretty definite that that firm is going to call its creditors together.* See A.C.224, Page 30. -14-
PRESIDENT:   Does that reference to rationalisation on a large scale apply to the German industry?     I gathered that from your report.MR. HAMILTON?    I am not referring only to Germany in that, Sir,     We have had one or two &quot;big amalgamations in Yorkshire which have been equally unsuccessful.     I do not think rationalisation has ever been given a really fair trial, but it never has succeeded yet in those attempts that have been made.MR. CLAU30N:   What does Mr. Hamilton mean when he says it has not been given a fair trial?     Is it because trade has been so bad?MR. HAMILTON:   Well, flotations have taken place at largely inflated values.     In this case of the Norddeutsehe, the big German concern, some very serious mistakes were made. It is difficult to explain, but the N.W.K. has in a sense been competing with its own customers;    instead of confining itself to its own business it has bought over a few of its customers, with the result that it has got across the great bulk of them.     That, in itself, was enough to cause failure, but in addition to that it has been such a big concern that it is suspected that a lot of very shady work has been going on. I think some rather startling revelations will come out.MR. W.40G:    I take it Mr. Hamilton is not really condemning the principle, but a partfcular illustration?MR. HAMILTON:   There are difficulties in the wool textile trade with regard to rationalisation which do not apply to other trades.     There is a good deal of individual design required, and every man and especially every woman likefe to be dressed rather differently from somebody else.     Individual taste plays such a large part that it makes it very difficult to rationalise the industry in the same way as you would say, in the iron and steel trade.     Still a certain amount could be done that has not yet been attempted.MR. CAIRNS:   That statement, Mr. Chairman, about amalgamation, brings in a curious point in our experience. We find that our most prosperous industries are those in which the affairs of the industry have developed in the hands of a trust.     I will not name particular industries, but there is one particularly which after it had fallen into the hands of a trust yielded very much larger profits than previously. You can see that there is not the same pressure of competition exerted when an industry gets into that position.MR. HAMILTON:    I do not know that the Co-operative Societies have been particularly successful in their textile enterprises.MR. CAIRNS:   That, again, bears out my point, Mr. Chairman. That is an industry not in the hands of a trust, but I referred to industries that are exclusively in the hands of a trust. I might mention the soap industry, for instance.     I did not want to mention that, but it is the same with margarine, too. I know that Mr. Varley could reinforce that statement.MR. HAMILTONa   There was an attempt after the war to rationalise the clothing industry;   what were known as standard
mi atS u usuits were issued to ex-army men;    they were not very popular, as I think, as far as clothing is concerned, everybody likes to show a little bit of individuality if he can.INDIA .MR. LINDSAY:    During the past month we have had two important and interesting reports published on India; one is Sir Arthur Salter&apos;s report on an economic enquiry in India, on the need for a Central Economic Council for India and Economic Councils for the Provinces.     Hitherto the best development on those lines has been in the Punjab where they had a Board of Economic Enquiry developing I think on lines rather different from similar boards in other countries in that it combines in one board (in its two sections) the investigation j of agricultural problems and investigation of ineustrial problems.      The idea of these two halves of one board is to maintain close contact between agricultural and manufacturing progress.The other report, Sir, is the Royal Commission on Labour. I have it In front.of me;    it is rather large but there Is a very convenient resume at the end.      There, are just two points which I.think are worth mentioning in regard to the report.      The first is a general recommendation for a reduction in the hours of work from 60 to 54 per week;    that, of course,  is subject to qualifications in various respects, but that is the general tendency.      Then another recommendation of some importance is to reduce the periods for wage payments, which at present are very largely monthly   with very often a delay of 12 or even 15 days before the wages are paid after the termination of the period for which they ar . cue.      The recommendation is that the wages should as far as possible be paid weekly in future, the hope, of course, being that there will be a reduction in indebtedness in consequence.I turn now to the general p:&apos;Sition in India.      The crop position is on the whole fairly good.      The Meteorological Department In India has mare great progress in Its arrangements for estimating ths progress of the monscon and the probable effects of the monsoon, and it has r^ducsd. these almost to mathematical formulae.      I see that the forecast for the coming monsoon has been published in India in the middle of June,  just as the monsoon opansd, and records the probability that the coming monsoon will bs at or a little less than ths average;    a rainfall of at least four-fifths, but probably not the full average rainfall for recent years.The wheat position in India is a little alfficult to estimate.      We have had a good crop;    prices on ths whole have been fairly well sustained in India as compared with world prices, making expert business difficult.      I should think a very fair deduction from that is that the fall in wheat prices has stimulated, local consumption in India,      One must not forget that in a country like India a fall in wholesale prices almost immediately reaches the consumer;    ther-  Is no intervention of a milling or a baking incustry, and the consumer gets practically ths whole benefit of ths fall in prices apart, of course, from the fact that such a large number of consumers in India are also proouc a? s.
With regard to the rice -position, Mr. Cairns explained that rice prices were lower than perhaps they have     ever been before.     There, again, we find in India that the reduction in prices is stimulating consumption.     Burma is our &quot;big exporting province, and the Government estimate of the exportable surplus of rice from Burma is actually being realised.      We have now passed six months of the new season, and the proportions of exports for those six months is up to expectation,    Although the prices we are getting are very poor, it is at least satisfactory that our crop is moving, and that we do not anticipate any abnormally high stocks, at the end of the seasoniThe figures of jute sowings have just been published, and show a considerable reduction over last year&apos;s figures.     The crop will therefore be distinctly on the low side, prices in London and Dundee responded at once, jumping from about  16.5s. for first marks to over  17.      There is likely to be, I think, a relapse as stocks are high, but the present indications point to a liquidation of those stocks in a year&apos;s time.COLONIAL TRADE.MR. CLAUSON:    I will put in the usual figures&quot;1.      I am afraid there are not very many of them this month, it is rather early in the month.     The most interesting ones are for the Gold Coast.     Some months agoY I told you that the local cocoa farmers - who are all natives - came to the conclusion that they would be done down by the wholesalers, and for a long time they refused to sell the new cocoa crop.     Then, in about January last, they decided to sell the cocoa, and since then the effect has been very extraordinary, the exports have gone up with a bang, and for February and March they are very substantially higher than they were a year age.     That means that the cocoa which has been held up in the previous months has nov/ been sent forward.     The effect has been that the favourable trade balance for the Gold Coast for the first three months of this year is about  2,800,000 and, in fact, it is slightly more than the favourable balance for the whole of the last year.      That is largely due to the very severe fall in imports, which was the result of the hold up earlier, but it is interesting to see that the Gold Coast seems to be keeping up, and although imports have fallen away so terrifically that has hit the foreigner more than the British trader, and the percentage of imports from the United Kingdom for the first three months of the year is 54 per cent, of the- whole as against 51 per cent, for the same period of the previous year.     The percentage from the United Kingdom for the whole of 1930 was 43, which is even lower, and for 1929 was 47, so it looks as if British trade is advancing at the expense of the foreign competitor to a certain extent.BANKING.MR. WAGG;    From the Money Market point of view, the outstanding event has been the- progressive weakening of the financial situation in Germany.     The delicately balanced position of the German Banks became more clearly revealed last September, when heavy withdrawals of foreign credits followed* See page 24.t See A.C.  219 p.3.
fr n othe successes of the National Socialist Party in the German elections.      The disclosure in May of the serious position of the Credit Anstalt, Vienna, with its world wide ramifications, caused great nervousness and brought about further withdrawals on a large scale from Germany, which have continued up to the present day,  accompanied by a flight from the mark by German Nationals,      The strain that the Reichsbank has experienced is illustrated by a comparison of its return issued before the September election and that at the end of the last half year. These show that the Reichsbank has lost in this period over  50 millions of gold assets, and it is estimated that it has used up the whole of the recent credit of  20 millions granted by a consortium of the Central Banks, as well as a part of the credit of  10 millions granted to the Gold Discount Bank by the Federal Reserve Board.     Herr Dietrich, the Reich Finance Minister, estimated that the German banking structure during the last nine months has been deprived of between  150 million and  200 million of foreign exchange.      It is significant that the bulk of these withdrawals have been on French and American account.      In view of the fact that withdrawals are still continuing, It is too early to state that the &quot;Hoover Plan&apos;1 ! has put an end to the crisis, but I confidently believe that the turning point has been reached.With the customary exception of the end of the half-year, call money here has remained very easy, and outside the clearing Banks the discount market have been able to borrow at ratesvarying between one per cent,  and one and three-quarters per cent.      But the discount rate has gradually fallen away, owing to the plethora cf money from two and one-eighth per cent,  in mid-June to one and seven-eighths per cent,  to-day, and Bill Brokers have been in the somewhat anomalous position of having to borrow from the clearing banks at two per cent., whilst the bill rate at times has been as low as cne-and-three-quarters per cent,      This condition in the money market is symptomatic of the general depression in trade and has been accentuated by the recent heavy increase in the   gold holding of the Bank of England, which is now in the region of  165 millions, and is expected to be increased by a further  5 millions in transit from Australia, and also posaibly by the release of  2 millions to  3 millions sovereigns held for the account of the Argentine . Government in London.      British Government securities have continued to rise to higher levels under the influence of easy monetary conditions, and are now at record high post-war levels. The issue on July 8th of  3 million Tanganyika four per cent. Loan 1951/71 (principal and interest guaranteed b.; the British Government) yielding only  4.4.6 per cent, met with a very good   reception.      In certain banking circles there is a distinct feeling that in the next few months, the opportunity will arise enabling a total conversion of Five Per Cent. War Loan, an operation not only desirable from the point of view of British Government credit, but which would give immediate budgetary relief.Due to the Reparation and War Debt one year moratorium, the German Government should be enabled to balance its budget for the y.,ar 1931/32;    on the other hand the Budgets of the other Great Powers will probably show large deficits.     The United -States of America have a deficit of  180 millions for the year ending 30th June, 1931, and the present financial year will see their revenues reduced by  50 millions, representing one year&apos;s service of War Debt.     Furthermore, approximately  200 millions has been borrowed under the terms of the Veterans&apos; War
Bonus Bill.     The British Government will suffer a loss of revenue of  10 to  15 millions, and have a largely overdrawn Unemployment Insurance Fund.      The French Government will lose  15 millions to  20 millions, and also have to contend with declining revenues.      The importance of these world-wide chaotic Budgetary conditions lies not only in the large- o.uf i city ,but in the fact that they are being covered by Government borrowing and not by taxation.MOTOR INDUSTRY.MR. ROUTES.    The comparative decline in the production and sales of motorcars shown in the recent reports appears to be accentuated in the aggregate during the past month.      In certain oases stock position, both in the hands of manufacturers and dealers is becoming difficult.     This is more serious having regaro to the fact that the selling season is coming to an end. The opinion is generally, that business in the Motor industry will not show very great signs of activity for the remainder of the season.The uncertainty of the licensing position under the Road Traffic Act still affects the manufacturers of public service vehicles, and there would appear to be no signs of Improvement until the end of the year.      In the case of goods vehicles the volume of sales is fair, and perhaps a little more promising than a month ago.     As a matter of fact even since I wrote this I have got further figures, and there is no doubt that the light truck industry is showing very rapir* progress from the point of view of transportation.      The financial difficulties indicateo. in the last report&quot;&quot;&quot; are clearly shown by the appointment of a Receiver in two cases of manufacturers of heavier classes of commercial vehicles.Imports continue to decline,  and remain about 75 per cent, below last year&apos;s figures.      Certain old stock of imported cars, however, are being eliminated at low prices.      That applies, of course, to the home market.     Evidently, America has held some of her stocks up, with a view to selling them casually throughout the season.      They have now found  it difficult, ano we have had quite a lot of selling, not to the open public, but to the group of traders who deal more in second-hand cars, rather than in new cars.      They are virtually new cars, s,metimes being sold at almost second-hand prices.Employment In the allied trades continues to fall, and there appear to be no signs of an early Improvement.     as from July 6th, however, negotiations have bean concluded between the Employers&apos; federation and the Trades Unions, whereby certain piece rate reductions have been brought about.      This in turn should render our p isition more competitive and prove an encouragement to the industry.      That, Sir, is quite a considerable thing so far as the motor industry is concerned, and broadly speaking shows between 6 and 7 per cent, reduction on the labour charges from a piece-rate point of view.Little change can be noted in exports.      The general fall in number and value is approximately the same as in the case of Home sales, but the comparative position in all Dominion and Colonial markets is improving.      In New Zealand, where the 1930 Imp.rts from the Unitec Kingdom were some 35 per cent, of the total, the imports
from here up to the end of March, 1931, were over 60 per cent. Broadly speaking, however,  the market  for cars and trucks in the Dominions and Colonies is only 50 per cent, of the 1930 figures.RETAIL TPADE.MR. MARQUIS.      The tables that I am putting in for May show that the retail trade, measured by cash value of sales, is running about 4% per cent below the correspond.ing period of last year.      Sales fell by 5,4 per cent,  in comparison with May, 1930, while the period, for February to May shows a reduction of 4.6 per cent, as compared with 4.3 per cent.for February to April.      Some allowance has again to be made for the vagaries of the calendar, on this occasion the variation of the date oi  lilhitsuntide throwing the comparison out to some extent.      The results may,  from that point of view, look some-what disappointing, as the earlier Whitsuntide should have brought more trade in May this year.      Any advantage which might have bscjn enjoyed from that cause was more than counter-balanced by unfavourable weather ,  and you may know, Sir, that weather to the retailer is more serious than weather  to ths farmer, and is always wrong.     The effect of the weather on trade v/cc     brought out in an interesting way by the Departmental Store results in Germany.      In spite of the prevailing depression a warm ana sunny May combined, with the earliar Whitsuntide brought about an increase in sales of 3.4 per cent, in the German Departmental Stores as compared with 193 0, which was quite contrary to the experience both in this country and the United States.The sale of foodstuffs remains remarkably steady at about 5 per cent below last year, but as food prices, according to the cost of living index have fallen by 7.9 per cent, over the period it seems reasonable to assume that larger quantities of food are passing into consumption.      Turning to the comparative results of Department Stores alone, cash sales fell in May by 7.9 per cent, as compared with a fall of 14 p*r cent, in ths United States according to the Federal Reserve Board, and an increase in Germany according to the Institut fur Konjunkturforschung, of 3.4 per cent.     The cumulative sales figures from February to May for Great Britain, the United States, and Germany, show reductions of 4.3 per cent., 9 per cent., and 9.4 per cent, respectively.     So far as this c country is concerned, the London West-End Stores continue to suffer  the worst experience.     Sales during May have fallen off by 12,6 per cent, as compared with an average all over the country of 7.9.      The figures of sales Indicate that apart from food-stuffs the sales in the North (not including Scotland) have fallen off by 3.3, par cent, those in the South, excluding Lonoon and the London suburban areas have Increased by .5 per cent.      These figures compare with a figure for Great Britain as a whole which has dropped, by 5.3 per cent.     There seems some Indication there, I think of the relative prosperity of the North and of the South.     As the date of this meeting falls earlier than usual it has not been possible to obtain sufficient returns to form a reliable estimate of trade conditions during June, and unfortunately, owing to variation in the date of the semi-annual sales It would, be difficult to arrive at any fair comparison until thd results sf June and July are taken together . Thd results which have so far cone to hand suggest ths.t trade as a whold has not been much different from that none in other months this year..       Conditions generally were cull and. quiet
in the earlier part of the month, hut seam to have improved, with the better weather which set in towards the end.     once, again, it is to be noted that owing to the considerable drop in prices more people are employed in the trade to take less money, which necessarily affects the margin of profit on which the distributor is working.     The drop in prices appears to be increasing consumption, and the fall in commodity prices appears to be passing to the consumer.     I had an interesting report given to me late last night by one firm, stating that they had worked out figures that show that an increase of l,5oo,000 transactions had produced an increased profit of a little over  1,700 thereby giving some evidence of the last statement that I made.      I will put in a return, Sir, shoeing the detailed figures for different parts of the country-5;&quot;(The Proceedings terminated).*These figures are not reproduced as they were published in the Board of Trade Journal on June 25th, 1931 (page 823).
BUILDIKG.MR. BARRON sent the following reportThe position in the Building Industry shows very little change from the previous month.   There has been a slight reduction in the figures of unemployment (the latest published figures are 18.1) but in normal years unemployment is almost negligible during May and June.   There does not seem to be much prospect of a great deal of improvement in the immediate future.There is a further fall in the estimated value of new buildings, as tabulated by the Ministry of Labour, although it may be assumed that allowing for a certain decrease in the general cost of building, the actual decrease is not quite so great as represented in the decline in value.At the moment the Ministry of Health are introducing legislation^- for the purpose of building 40,000 houses in Rural Districts, and provided this Is carried out, it will have a considerable influence in creating useful employment for quite a number of building trade workers in the smaller towns and villages, where unemployment has been even worse than in the large industrial centres.So far as industrial and commercial building is concerned, little improvement can be hoped for so long as the general industrial depression continues.SHIPBUILDING *MR. BARROi? sent the following report-No visible improvement has taken place in the shipbuilding industry, very few orders have been placed, and these only of a minor character, while according to a correspondent to the press, the orders for Russia which have been talked about for some time, have now been definitely placed with Japanese Builders, credit terms being the factor which decided the point.    If this is the case it seems most regrettable that the Government or the financiers of this country could not offer as favourable terms as Japan and so secure seme much needed work for this hard hit industry.The shipbuilding employers in common with other industries, ore seeking a reduction in the wages of their workers, under the usual plea of restoring the prosperity of the industry.The workers, as usual are somewhat sceptical of the beneficient effect of these proposed reductions, the usual negotiations are proceeding and it may be expected that a solution will be found without any dislocation by disputes whioh would only add to the terrible depression from which this industry is suffering.&quot;Housing (Rural Authorities) Bill,
S JL ibThe only oheerful views I have noticed is that, today the Clyde Trust are considering a scheme proposed by Messrs. Barclay Curie and Company, whereby they intend to construct a large Gracing Dock and Wharfage, an extension of their present &quot;Sard, and it may be assumed that the firm have complete confidence in the future of the Shipbuilding Industry, when they are thus preparing for the future.RUBBER.SIR GEORGE BPHARRELL wrote that there is practically no change in the situation of the Rubber Industry since last meeting.BOOTS AND SHOES.MR. BOSTOCK sent the following reportThe production figures for May were:- 840-400 dozenpairs.In Stafford there has been some slight improvement in trade and sales of women1s lifht footwear have shown a welcome increase.   At Norwich, however, business is rather slower.     July seems to have become a recognised quiet month for most shoe factories, and the present position has been anticipated for some weeks past.   Most firms are on short time and are standing some of their operatives down.   It is the usual Summer slump, and apparently there will be little activity before orders come to hand for Autumn and Winter lines.The recent improvement in the weather is said to be doing the retail shoe trade quite a lot of good at Leicester, and there ia a belief that it will ultimately benefit the manufacturer.   But it has come too late to help the manufacturers Summer trade to any appreciable extent, for wholesale buyers are now interested only in Autumn goods, though it is not suggested that they are olamouring for supplies.   There should, however, be a quickening of the pace   before the current month is out.   The only thing that would then be required to ensure a successful Autumn season for the shoe monufacturer would be a hardening, of leather values, which, incidentally, sore people appear to rego,rd as a probability.   While probably 99f. of women&apos;s plaited sandals have hitherto been made on the Continent, there may be half-a-dozen or more firms who will try their hand for next year&apos;s trade.Reports regarding the course of business in Northampton, although somewhat varied, tend to indicate a slightly better demand for footwear, and it is evident, from the calls being made for numbers held in stock, that In some parts of the country consumer-demand has improved.   A continuation of fine weather will give a further impetus to trade, although it is realised that, the absence of forward bulk business is hardly likely to be remedied until there Is an improvement in basic conditions.Export trade is receiving the careful attention of a number of manufacturers, who realise the necessity for intensive study of rarket conditions, and for olose contact with distributors abroad.

Employment.t in., June , 1951.MR.HILTON handed In the following report and tables:-There was a further net increase in unemployment during June.    In the first week of the month there was a partial resumption of work after the extended Vhitsun stoppages, but in each subsequent week, the numbers unemployed showed an increase..The total on the registers of Employment Exchanges at 29th June, was 2,664,889 as compared with 2,629,971 at 1st June.The net increase of 34,918 between those two dates was accounted for by an increase of 131 in the numbers wholly unemployed, and an increase of 34,787 in the numbers temporarily stopped.The number of men on the Register increased by 50,493* The number of women decreased by 11,36? while the number of juveniles decreased by 4,208,In every Division,  except South Eastern the numbers unemployed fluctuated during the month.    The net variations between 1st June and 29th June, were as follows:-London, South Eastern ) - 9,001&amp; South Western. )Midlands. -f40,810North Eastern 4-44, 312North Western -39,072Scotland - 7,010Wales. 4- 3,879It will be seen from the statement attached (Table 2) that while the monthly average numbers on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain showed a fall from February to April, the inorease in the Register at 1st June, arrested that movement.    The average for June shows a further increase over May.Employment declined between 18th May and 22nd June in coal-mining, engineering, and in the cotton and wool textile industries.    There was little change in iron and steel and shipbuilding and ship-repairinga    Unemployment increased slightly in the building trade and decreased in the distributive trades.,The total number of insured persons in employment at 22nd June, 1931, is estimated provisionally to be about 109,600 less than at&apos;18th May, and about 578,300 less than at 2 3rd June,  1930.

June 13th, 4,332,000 tons. June 20th, 4,217,000 tons.The average output for the thirteen weeks March 28th to . June 20th was 4,258,000 tons, as compared with 4,616,000 tons for the corresponding period last year, an average decrease of 357,000 tons.The number of persons employed in the industry for the week ended June 20th was 845,200 and the average for the thirteen weeks ended June 20th was 862,400 as compared with 939,300 for the corresponding period last year.    The output per person per week for the thirteen weexs has increased from 4.91 tons to 4.94 tons as compared with the same period last year.Unemployment for&apos; the month of May was 27 per cent, as against 26.1 per cent, in April and an average for 1930 of 20.5 per cent.The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom (excluding the Irish Free State) in May was 3,325,000 tons as compared with 3,406,000 tons in April (a decrease of 81,000 tons and 4,855,661 tons in May 1930 (a decrease of 1,530,000 tons).The average price per ton f.o.b. in May was 15/2d. r.s compared with 15/10d. in April and 15/9d. in March.

Some good orders in Birmingham have been taken for forward delivery, but no general recovery is in sight.Spelter.Most consumers seem if anything overbought in the Birmingham area.     Swansea however report an improvement and one big order from Baldwins.     Viredrawers in Liverpool have been in the market for Refined and a rather better tone is noticeable.COAL.SIR WALTER RAINE sent the following report:-There is unfortunately nothing to report which is of an encouraging nature.      In fact, if one were to give a true description of the present situation,  the only adequate words would be - &quot;the position is black and desperate&quot;.     The worst feature is that there is no sign of any improvement.     A month ago*, I referred to the French position.     Since then, I have been in France, along with some Colliery Owners and other Exporters, at the invitation of the French Importers,  in order to attend their Annual meeting at Caen.      I had the opportunity of listening to the speech of the French Minister of Health, who made a declaration on behalf of the French Government at the Annual Dinner.     He stated quite definitely that they were not going to allow the French Miner to bear all the burden of the present industrial slump, and seeing that France Imported 30,000,000 tons a year,  12,000,000 tons of which came by rail, and 18,000,000 tons by sea, they hoped that there would be some arrangement made of a voluntary nature to restrict the Imports, both by land and sea.     Meantime, in order not to do any more harm than necessary to their various Ports, they were not going to attempt any immediate restriction more than was taking place voluntarily of over-sea imports, but they were going to immediately cause a reduction in the quantities entering France by land.     He concluded by repeating that he hoped some arrangement would be come to voluntarily, otherwise the Government would nave to take drastic measures, and any country that impeded the progress of development along the line indicated, would be dealt with very severely by France itself. -At a special meeting of the Syndicate des Importateurs held in Paris last Friday,  the following Resolution was passed -&quot;L&apos;Assevablee&apos; Generale des Importateurs a accepte&apos; aujourd&apos;hui le prmeipe des &quot;licences&quot;.     II est done probable que 1&apos;on ya etablir promptement des restrictions aux importation, surtout par voie de terre, La Grande Bretagne sera taxee a 5% seulement:    c^st peu&quot;.* See A.C. 234, page 38,
There have been rumours this week that the French Government Intends to interfere Immediately on the lines of the above Resolution, but I can obtain no confirmation of this, and think that as a responsible Minister has spoken so recently, the Frenoh Government would not be likely to take such immediate aotion.ENGINEERING.SRo ROWLAND sent the following reports -Review of current conditions.The statistics for May show no sign of recovery as yet from the very low level of depression, and the position is even more discouraging when contrasted with that of twelve months ago.    Production totals are still muoh reduced, although the outputs of both iron and steel were slightly greater than in April.     On the other hand,  imports of iron and steel were higher, and exports lower, than in the previous month, and therefore the adverse balance of imports,whioh was obtained now    for nine consecutive months,  increased auring May.    Imports of machinery in volume were approximately the same as in April, but at a higher average value;    whereas the exports of machinery returned a slightly higher tonr-age, proportionate to the longer month, but fell slightly below the average value per ton recorded in April.There was a further slight diminution in unemployment throughout the country during May, but unfortunately this once again did not apply to the engineering industry and its several branches.    The index of unemployment for the engineering Industry as a whole now stands at 27fa *f insured workers, almost twice the figure of a year ago.    The latest statistics, issued by the Board of Trade, of the numbers of skilled metal and engineering emigrants from this oountry overseas, show that in the year 1930 3,587 skilled men departed for non-European countries, as against 6,561 in 1929, and 5,806 in 1928.    Of these the majority in 1930 went to Canada and the United States, and of the total 2,022, or 57% went to British countries.In considering the prospective situation, it is obvious that very little consolation can be derived from a study of past records, but it may be hoped that the offer now made by the United States Government, for a yearfs respite in the payment of inter-governmental debts, will lead eventually to a general recovery of industrial demand and productivity. In the domestic sphere of our own industry the recent agreement for the revision of wages and working conditions is particularly gratifying.Appended will be found the usual list giving particulars of the more important contracts recently placed with British firms,  and also of other items of interest.     As the trade depression continues,  the number of new orders placed is shrinking, and still fewer are reported.      It is therefore becoming increasingly difficult to obtain information under this heading.
Metal and Engineering Freight Rates on German and British Railways.In any consideration of the relative competitive position as between Britain and her Continental rivals in industry, the question of transport costs on manufactured products is very important.    For a variety of reasons, including the exceptional conditions,  such as subsidies, pertaining on the railway systems abroad, it has always been found difficult to obtain strictly comparable data of the actual freight rate,  as concerning engineering and allied industry, charged on British and Continental railways.    By the courtesy of a member of the Association, however, we have been supplied with certain detailed information regarding charges on selected traffics on the German railways, and also the rates on the corresponding freights in this country.    These data will.be found summnrised in a Table appended, setting out firstly tne freight rates (expressed in pence per ton-mile) for the respective distances of haulage from Berlin for each of the categories of traffic; and, in the second part of the table,  the ton-mile rates for the corresponding traffics on the British railways, for journeys from various centres to a shipbuilding location unnamed.    In each case the distances are listed from shortest to longest mileage. The German particulars of distances and money rates have, of course, been equated throughout to British scales for comparative purposes.Unfortunately the data available in the present instance for British railways are at present very scanty, and for that reason inter alia the inferences to be drawn from a formal comparison of the British and German rates are somewhat hazardous.    But it is to be noted that the present statistics confirm what was already understood, namely, that the German ton-mile rates on these heavy traffics, almost invariably, are below the British rates, although this advantage is offset by the considerably longer average distance of haul in the former country.TABLE/

ME. WALKSR sent the following reports-Nottingham. &quot;At the present time the state of the Hosiery Industry leaves much to he desired.     There are, however, one or two bright spots, but in these sections manufacturers are not finding business easy to obtain.The full-fashioned silk hose section appears to be the brightest and is being helped by the tendency amongst the public to ask for British made goods.     If this spirit would develop, for the class of goods manufactured by other sections of the industry it would do a great deal in relieving the unemployment and short time working now existing.As regards the Underwear section of the industry, business in the lighter weight hosiery is improving and has no doubt quickened by the advent of warmer weather.     The demand for the heavier goods is, however, slow, but as raw materials have during the past few days shown a tendency to harden, manufacturers are hoping that this will induce buyers to begin to place their commitments for the forthcoming season.Leicester.In the underwear departments only a moderate amount of business is being done, both as regards bulk of sale and price obtained, nor are the future orders for Autumn up to their usual standard.The Knitted Outerwear Trade is a little more satisfactory for the time of the year.The imports of Foreign Stockings and Hose during May amounted to no less than 637,55? dozen pairs, Underwear 156,220 dozens and Fancy Hosiery 103,298 dozens.Hinckley.There is very little change to report in regard to the condition of trade.     There is a slight improvement in the Underwesr Section but Hosiery generally is flat and the number of unemployed is only slightly reduced.Mansfield.There is very little change to report in the state of trade in this district.     Some orders 6ippear to have been placed for cashmere hose for Autumn delivery at very cut prices and there is a certain amount of enquiry for artificial silk and wool plated hose.     The fashioned pure silk trade has fallen off considerably. This apparently is due to increasing import of German goods.     The better end of the fashioned trade (fancy) is rather better due possibly to some American orders.Hawick.The trade both in the underwear and outerwear sections shows no betterment and the seasonal improvement usually associated with this time of year has not come along.
The Home market considering the general depression is no worse than might he expected hut the hottorn is quite out of the Export trade and practically no business is doing,There are no signs of improvement and the prospects for winter are bleak.IRON AND STEEL.MR. WALMSLilY sent the following report:-The recent pronouncement by Mr, Hoover concerning the moratorium for war debts and reparations has led to a more hopeful tone in some iron and steel centres, but this is not reflected in increased activity,     Some centres report that there is a larger volume of enquiry but actual orders are still very scarce.     In any case the season of the year is approaching when conditions are usually quiet in the iron and steel trade (holidays being taken in Scotland in July and in England in August)  and there are no signs that this year will prove any exception to the rulerThe &quot;tonic&quot; effect of the Hoover pronouncement has been much more marked on the Continent than here, and for the last two weeks Continental prices have shown a distinctly upward tendency 0     In the last fortnight blooms have risen by 2/- to 61/- (P.0oB. Antwerp):    sheet bars by 3/&apos;- to 66/-:    steel bars by 3/6 to 70/6;    joists by 2/- to 67/-.      One enthusiastic Belgian merchant describes the market as &quot;very animated&quot; and states that &quot;the inflow of orders is very abundant&quot; and adds that &quot;contracts are generally declined because higher prices are expected&quot;, but it is doubtful whether this enthusiasm is warranted by the general improvement in business, and certain English buyers have maintained a much more conservative attitude,     In such circumstances the need for the International Cartel to exercise more real control over production is increasingly apparent, for if the rise in prices induces increased production on the Continent,  it can only result in a reversion to the present deplorable condition.With regard to the Cartel,  it may be said that negotiations are still proceeding for its renewal and that it is the intention that fines for exceeding the quota shall be much more severe.     Various obstacles are being encountered, such for instance as the demand on the part of certain Belgian and Luxemburg firms for increased quotas..     It seems likely that agreement will not be arrived at for some little time and that the Cartel will be renewed on the present basis from month to month.Shipbuilding shows no sign of improvement and this affects particularly Scotland and the North East Coast;    in the former case production is proceeding at only about 50% of capacity, plant is running intermittently and new orders are scarce. Although orders for one or two vessels have been placed on the Clyde, the tonnage of steel required is light and will not be of material help to the steel works.     The Shipbuilders have manifested uneasiness in regard to the big difference in price of British and Continental steel and negotiations have been entered into with a view to considering the possibility of some alleviation whereby the Shipbuilders may be enabled to secure a larger share of what little world business is going at the
present time.     Both home and export trade in the steel industry-is very dull and only the Canadian market shows any signs of activity,,     Australia,  India, China and South America continueto &quot;buy very little.\It is too early to give actual figures of the production of iron and steel in June,  but it is estimated that the output of pig iron will be about 325 j. GOO tons and of steel 434,000 tons. These show a slight reduction on the May figures and compare very unfavourably with the outputs for June 1930, which were 563,000 tons for pig iron and 600,000 tons for steel.Table,

The figures for the periods ending November 1930 and February 1931, are interesting, the former shewing an increase on the previous year, and the latter being practically stationary.    These figures may reflect the rush to put on new vehicles and open   up   new routes before the Traffic Commissioners came into office.    The possible excess over requirements might be a part cause of the drop in figures for the last quarter,The figures for the 3 months ending May 31st are-Haokneys over 8 seats.

ADDENDUM TO BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL MINUTES OF JULY 9th.  (A..C,   895),MR. FOLLSTT HOLT has sent the following memorandum:-SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.On account of the financial condition of the South American countries no speedy improvement of our export trade to that continent can he expected.     The low value of produce has upset Governments, budgets and exchanges, and created situations with which the inexperienced Peoples were ill-xrrepared to cope.      The folly and danger of over-expenditure and the too free use of credit, is beginning to be realized and when values of produce improve we shall find a good and mere stable market for our manufactures,ARGENTINA.The Members of the Provisional Government continue the work of reducing National expenditure and of facing the heavy floating indebtedness.     Progress is being made in the task in spite of a falling revenue on account of the restriction of taxable imports and of the low value of exports,     A.s regards the latter, for the first 6 months of the current year (January to June) 8 million tons were shipped from the country as compared with 5 million tons for the same period of 1930 but the total value was 4 million sterling less.The currency (peso) is heavily backed by gold but as gold is not released for export, except for certain government requirements, exchange depends upon the supply and demand of commercial requirements and the peso, with a theoretical value of 47.5/8 pence, is only worth, for exchange purposes, about 35 pence, a heavy discount which is inflicting material damage to the immense amount of British capital invested in the country and making the task of British and other importers difficult. Although the balance of trade is in favour of Argentina, before exchange can materially improve, higher prices are necessary for exports to overcome the weight of hidden imports, unless Argentina is prepared to release gold.There has been no marked development in the political situation.     The Conservative party, backed by the army, is in Provisional command.     The majority of electors is believed to be Radical.     The former will not hand over to the latter until leaders are produced from the Radical ranks believed to be capable of forming an honest and progressive government,PARAGUAY,A further rupture of diplomatic relations with Bolivia is reported but is not likely to matter very much.This interesting little buffer state is not in a very good way.     iixchange is based on the Argentine peso, now at a heavy discount.     The principal asset of the country is cattle used for extract and canning, and prices are very low.     Other exports, cotton, yerba, tobacco, timber, hides, are all suffering in volume and price,The/
The great majority of the native population is inured to a life of poverty, unaccompanied as it is by cold or hunger or the knowledge of better conditions.Great Britain holds the leading place amongst foreigners in the cattle, meat canning and extract and yerba industries.The Government is making every effort to avoid the necessity for a new moratorium, which if resorted to would be the third within 50 years and would affect Brazil&apos;s credit for a long time to come.     The Government believes that the danger has been removed.Sir Otto Niemeyer having travelled extensively in the Hinterland, has stated that evidence of the crisis in the interior is not as intense as it is pronounced to be by the residents and business people in the Cities.     He commends the Provisional Government&apos; s decision to avoid the emission of paper money and to secure a better budget by economy and increased taxation - a decision based, no doubt, upon his own advice.Revenue collections are improving and national expenditure is being steadily reduced, but on account of the heavy payments for foreign loans it will take time before any considerable rise can take place in the present low exchange value of the currency which has now no gold backing.Commerce in general has been quiet for some time past, though prospects for the future are a trifle better,,     Prices for coffee are relatively satisfactory.     The new crop will be smaller than last year but the quality will be better.     The country appears to be making some headway towards reform.The nitrate industry is still in a bad way and so far attempts to come to terms with Germany and other synthetic producers have failed.It is reported that the Government, in order to maintain the stability of the currency, has decided that the gold reserve of the Central Bank should not be drawn \upon for the payment of its foreign obligations.     Currency at the par rate will be deposited with the Central Bank to meet these obligations when bills are available in the market for the purpose,     Meanwhile, apparently the holders of government securities issued in foreign countries, will require to have patience and receive their interest at a later date in order that the internal financial position in Chile should not be disturbed.It cannot be said that Uruguay Is showing any great inclination to face the position into which the country has been plunged by over-expenditure and the world conditions.      So far foreign indebtedness has been met but at great cost in currency as it is at a heavy discount.     This discount is causing severe loss to the British Railways operating in the couhtry.BRAZILCHILE..URUGUAY,
