These withdrawals have been caused by a lack of confidence, which is not justified by the economic and budgetary situation of the county.In order to insure the maintenance of the financial stability of Germany, which is essential in the interests of the whole world, the Governments represented at the Conference are ready to co-operate so far as lies within their power, to .restore confidence.The Governments represented at this  Conference are ready to recommend for the consideration of the financial institutions in their respective countries the following proposals for relieving the immediate situation :-(1)  that the Central Bank credit of $100 million recently granted to the Reichsbank under the auspices of the Bank for Internatione.1 Settlements, be renewed at maturity for a period of three months:-lr-

G-.J-.A.,M. LaVivL:    I should like to express to Mr, MacDonald our gratitude for&apos;the authority with which he has directed our labours,  and the perfect impartiality which has aided our endeavours.    We have every right to congratulate ourselves on the cordiality which has prevailed during our discussions, from which neither frankness nor precision were absent.      The directness of speech which we have shown has been calculated to prevent many a misunderstanding,I  should like to say how gratified we are by the charming and distinguished hospitality accorded to us in London by the British Government,i hope,  finallys  that I may be allowed to inform the representatives of the United States of America how much we have appreciated their intervention in the Conference which has just ended.      They have united a powerful idealism with that practical turn of mind which aids the search for solutions.      They have come to the assistance of the old world,    they have remembered their origins&apos;and they have joined with us in our attempt to put an end to the instability of the economic system of Europe and to re-introduce security.
G.2.That historic and inspiring event which has just taken place at Paris, the meeting      of      the French and German Ministers, \vj. 11     give the London Conference its special force and importance,.    In the presence of the representatives of the assembled Governments, I wish to give expression to my hope that the initial conversation which has just been held in Paris  &quot;ill he hut the prelude to a series of similar meetings which will lead to a policy of Franco-German co-operation,  the surest guarantee of security for the world,MR.   STIMSON:    Mr.  President,  I urn very ha 5py to second, the tribute of appreciation which has &quot;been offered, by M.  Laval. Those of us who have had experience of your labours at other Conferences have learned to rely upon your unfailing fairness, your sympathy,  and your idealism.    The goodwill which you radiate in Conferences of this sort is always one of the basic elements of their success, and I am sure that everyone present joins with M, Laval and myself In expressing our appreciation, and our feelings of gratitude for the goodwill and hospitality which you have shown us.I am also very glad to  express, on behalf of my own country, our very deep appreciation of the significance of the move which was initiated by the Prime Minister of France in inviting Dr. Pruning and the representatives of Germany to Paris, and our appreciation of the historic consequences which we are sure will flow from that meeting in the direction of conciliation and resulting confidence throughout the world.
G.3.Y&apos;e feel that we have witnessed a very great event, and -----we look forward to its progress and effectiveness as the months and years go by.     (Hear, hear).DR.

Laval that the American Delegates may take back with them from this Conference the re cognition of the fact that the Old \.orla and the New world are  closely inter-related and that the idealism of the American people is necessary as a moral support for Europeans.I was particularly glad to hear the remarks made by Ivi. Laval and ...r.  Stimson In regard to our meeting at Paris with the Drench  statesmen.      I an firmly convinced that confident co-operation between the countries is urgently necessary and   must  continue for the future , because in our present  situation, where new developments occur almost daily it is of the utmost importance that statesmen should meet continuously and have intercourse with each other.      It isonly by such confident co-operation that the situation can b improved and good times brought back.
G, 4SIGIvfOF. GRANDI;    I  join In the words uttered by&quot;* Laval j Mr, 81.1mson and Chancellor Brianing, I hopes and I strongly feel, that the end of this s perhaps too short.

How gratifying to all of us was the Conference in Faris between the represeiitatives of the German and French Governments,    I also associate myself with what has been said about our American colleagues,    I do not suppose the time will ever come when we shall be able to say that there is no linger an Atlantic, but the time has come when both spiritual and economic strands are being thrown across the Atlantic?and as the years go on and yearsII IIIIHIIIIilllllimiUMHllimiimilll........I...........n............t.........Ill ill.....I.....I..................i.......inl........milii............hum........i.......mm.....i............................................n.......11....................

Listening to M, Mathieu, I admire him for the extraordinary.    way in which lie can improve our eloquence and produce our sentences imperfectly uttered by ourselves? in the most perfect English and French,    Atthe same time, I would include in the expression   of our thanks to him the name of Dr,  Schmidt who has been very helpful to us with his French, German and English,    Dr, Schmidt,  like M, Mathieu.,. is an old friend of ours; and we hope that we shall meet them both again very frequently and ask them to give us the same admirable services that they have rendered at this Conference.Then there is the Secretariat,    Those very hard-forking and trustworthy gentlemen always give us of their very beet, and4 again we have had the same experience here,    I am sure you would like me to thank them on your behal ?,
