copy moTHIS DOCUMENT , IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIT AM 10 MAJESTY * 3 GQViSRMMENT.gCRjfiT.P.184(3X)0 A B t M S T,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotl&amp;ndot., The difficult position which has existed for many yearsco crawling in ths Moray Firth came, to a head again recently in connection with extensive damage by Dutch trawlers to anchored ood-nete in the Moray Firths      1 visited the Mo ray Firth, rust the local  fishermen and others and undertook to submit the position to my colleagues with suggestions for overcoming the difficulties.     This particular matter and the general question of trawling in the Moray Firth, of which it is part&quot;, are being . strongly pressed in the,House of Commons, and in the Debate on 3rd Junec 1931,  the Lord Avooate and I gave assurances that every effort will be made to find a solution of the whole problem nThe Netherlands. Government  (Who are doubtless watching these events) have recently enquired whether HoM*Government a-e willing to participate in an International Conference for the revision of. the North Sea Convention 188gnIn those circumstances it is necessary to decide the policy to be adopted by H-M^Government with regard to the Moray Firth., and,  in certain events.,, the question of the Firth of Clyde may also ariseni-- I regret .that on this question of fishery policy myPlight Horn-. Friend,  the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and I are at .variance..     Differences between England and Scotland on such questions are really of long standing,,      The question of the waters of exclusive fisuing pertaining to scotland/
Scotland arose at the time of the Union of the Crowns and in 1604 a Draft Treaty of Union was drawn up by Commissioners appointed by the Parliaments of England and scotland i      It contained a Clause reserving %z   Scotsmen their trade of .f ish-ing within their lochs,  firths and bays within land and in the seas within 14 miles of the coasts of the .realm of Scotland. The Treaty was signed by large muj orities of the English and Scottish Commissioners.      It was approved by King James and. adopted by the Scottish Parliament but it failed to come into force because,.,  for reasons unconnected with this fishery. Clauseo the: English Parliament declined to ratify it..Coming to more recent times the history of the Moray -&quot;firth  question during the last 40 years is briefly as follows:; -Section 7 of the Herring Fishery (Scotland.) Act, 1869p provides that beam and otter trawling may be prohibited in any pa?;t. of the Moray Firth by Byelaw made by the Fishery Board for Scotland and confirms^ fey. %ha Soevetary . qt Scotland-.     The existing By el aw mads and confirmed in 1892 prohibits such trawling in the whole of the Mo ray Firth0      In 1906 a full bench of the High Court of. Justiciary (Thirteen-.Judges) decided in the ease of Mortensen v. -Peters that,, as a matter of oon* struction,, the Act of 1889 applies to foreign as well as to British subjects and that Morten sen (a foreign subject acting as Master of a vessel registered in a foreign country) was rightly convicted of a contravention of the Byelawo     The Court had not to decide the question whether the Act of the Legislature was or was not in contravention of generally acknowledged principles of international law,, but some of the Judges, referred to certain aspects of. international law in relation to the territoriality of. bays.      In particular the Lord Justice General  (Lord Dunedin)  said that there were atleast/
least three points wrftlcw went far to show that the locus of MortenQen&quot;s offence  (about five miles? off Lossieraouth) was ihtra fauces terrag,  ioec within the jaws of the land,    Lora Kyllaohy con si cered that it was vain to. suggest that according to international law there was any part of the Moray Firth which was simply an area of the open sea,-.Early in 190? several further convi ctidns were obtained against foreign Masters of trawlers registered in Horwfcy for breaches of the Byelaw committed in the Moray jfirth at die-tanees varying from about five to twelve miles.from the coast, Orj the formal protest of the Norwegian Government, however,, the Foreign Office intervened and the foreign skippers who had been sent to prison were released-      Since 1907 no attempt has been made by any British Government to prosecute foreigners for trawling in the Moray Firth-In order to try to stop or reduce trawling by foreign^-ere in the Moray Firth Parliament in 1909 passed the Trawling in.Prohibited Areas (Prevention) Act,, which, forbids the land&apos; ing or sale in the United Kingdom of any fish caught by trawl-ing In the Moray Firth or other prohibited areas,  . This has been effective in stopping the landing of catches at British ports, but both before and after the War foreign trawlers have worked in the Moray Firth and landed their catches at foreign portso        . .The provision in the Act of 1889 and the Byelaw ma ,!.e under it have not been , ^^pcale^d^oj^^^j^^do      The prohibition of trawling is effective against British subjects,, but since 1907 it has not been enforced by any Government against, foreign subjects..,     This creates an anomalous situation which has been the subject of. recurrent criticism,, namely,,  that although British trawlers are prohibited from working in thsj Moray Firth it is open to foreign trawlers:.
A special difficulty arises in connection with tne anchored cod-nets which since 1906 have been worked by Moray Firth fishermen in the early months (January - March) of each year.     Foreign Trawlers operate on the same grounds in the ivioray Firth and cause considerable damage to the cod-netc, In the present year the cod^net fishermen&apos;s losses are estimated at about .. 800,      In the past Belgian trawlers have caused similar damage but in recent years the trawlers? con-cerned are almost all Dutch.-,At the Conference which 1 held at Buckle on the 7in, March,, the cod-net fishermen gave detailed accounts of the damage inflicted by j&amp;v^ofr fishermenIn one particularly glaring case a trawler continued to trawl aver anchored nets in broad daylight despite repeated warnings and signals.-    It is   difficult to resist the conclusion that in some oases the damage was wanton and deliberate,, and in several other cases I am convinced that there was at the least gross arid culpable carelessness.It is significant th:.t such serious oases of damage should have occurred during the cod-net fishing in tiie present year,,  considering that greater efforts wore mads by the fisher men than in any previous year to take reasonable precautions for the protection of the nets.      &quot;I am aware that the lighting and marking regulations have not been entirely complied with, tout the incidents of the past season give the fishermen, in my opinions, some excuse for the view that compliance with the regulations only increases the danger of damage.,in order to prevent or minimise such losses an effort has been made each year to induce th* Belgian and. JNetherland Governments to use their good offices to advise their trawlers to avoid the anchored cod-nets.     These efforts have been largely successful in the case of Belgium,      In the case- of holland/HI
Holland, however, although the Netherlands Government have ad-vised their trawlers to avoid the cornets, this advice hae not been effective, and,, as stated,,  considerable losses of cod-nets have been sustainedo       Reference is made in paragraph 16 to the question of representations to the Netherlands Government in respect of the losses sustained this year;    and to possible arrangements for securing more effective protection of the cod^nets in 1932-The cod-net question Is, however,, only one part of the wider Moray Firth question.     During the ten years, 1921 = 50, the Moray Firth fishermen have caught in the Firth white fish of an average value of over  220,000 per annum (of which the catch of the cod-nets represents about  20,000)-      It is necessary to .consiuer the general question of policy as affecting (l) the whole Moray Firth oaten,, averaging about  220,000 per annum,  (which,, in my view, would he much higher were it not for the depredations of foreign trawlers),   (2) the effect of the loss of this oatoh upon the economic life of the 8,000 fishermen concerned to whom it is an essential item in their total oaten,,  (including herrings),  of about 160,000 tons valued at about  1,600,00.0*The matter has been brought to a head by the Debate in the House of Commons on 3rd June in which the Government were very strongly pressed to find a solution and by the enquiry made by the Netherlands Minister as to the willingness . of Hf, Ms Government to n   ^ticlpate in an International Conference for the revision of the North. Sea Convention 1882cThe announcement of -the government s policy In Parlia-ment will turn largely upon the reply to bq given to the pro-posal of the Netherlands Government, and I, therefore,   submit the following observations with special reference to that proposal,(5) 7/
I suggeetthat the general basis of policy should bo that(a) the Government should maintain the statutory closure of the Moray Firth to trawling and should aim.at making it effective against foreigners;    and to that end(b) the Government should refrain from any admission that the Moray Firth is part of the High Sea$*Subject to these governing principles I am in favour of participation in.an International Conference for revision of the Horth Sea Fisheries Convention 1883 upon the following footing,, vi,s;^The British Delegates,,  without prejudice, to the question of a claim to full territorial jurisdiction over the Moray Firth at a future International, Conference on Territorial Waters which may be held a few years hence) should press the; proposal that tho Moray. Firth should be specially recognised in the amended North Sen Fisheries Convention as within &quot;the exclusive fi^shet^yi^llrolts&quot; of the British .tsleso     This would require an amendment of Article II of the Convention of 1882 on the lines of the precedent . relating to Granyilie Bay in France in Articles 1 and XX of the Convention of 1839 between Great Britain and Francec     The proposal made by the Netherlands Government that the ares of the North Sea Convention should be extended so as to -embrace the English Channel makes this precedent the more apposite.If the scope of the North Sea Convention should be an-l&amp;rgsd so as to extend to the West of Scotland,. I suggest that, &quot;she same policy of securing recognition of the Firth of Clyde as within &quot;the exclusive fishery limits15 of the British Jtsies should be followedoIn my view recognition of the Moray Firth (and of the Firth of Clyde if the Conference deals with that area) as within r,:the exclusive fishery limits^ is the minimum coursewhi oh/
Which will meet the case and satisfy public opinion through^ out Scotland0The.Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries has suggested to me the alternative of abolishing the statutory prohibition against trawling in the Moray Firth so that the Firth would be open in law and in practice both to British and to foraign trawlers *     While this would equalise the position as between British and foreign trawlers,, its effects,, in my opinion would be disastrous?      In the small towns and villages an the shore a of the Moray Firth there are about 8OOO fisher-men, to whose existence the white fish which they take from the Moray Firth is vital,..      It amounted in 1889 to about 25,000 tons in quantity and about ,2180,000 in value.      It now amounts in quantity to about 8,000 tons,, and,  in value,, to over , 200,,0oG a year.,      The fall from 25,000 tons to 8 ,,000 tons shows how severely the local fisheries have suffered from the operations of trawlers.,     The present catch,, though less than it would.be if the local fishermen were able to prosecute the fisheries of the Firth free; from the interference of trawlers, nevertheless represents an indispensable source of income for the Moray Firth fieh-ing cQmmunitiesFor those of thn fishermen, about 6,000 in number, who are mainly occupied in the herring fishings around the British coasts and who fish locally only between the herring seasons., the earnings from the local fisheries are of vital, importance now that awing to the shrinkage of the Russian and other markets the herring fishings now occupy only about 6 months in the year and ara insufficient to provide them with a full livelihood. The prospects of the herring fishings are not-bright/
bright and tlie local white fishings will undoubtedly become of oven greater Importance to the local fishermen in the near future.     1 am convinced&apos; that if the J-Ioray Firth were, opened to trawling as suggested the position of the local men would become desperate because the British and foreign trawlers together r:.&apos;would  speedily olear out the fish in the Firth. The result, in my judgment, would be the utter ruin of the Moray Firth share-fishermen, who, in skill, in endurance, and in sturdiness of character, are, by general admission, u&amp;sur-&apos; passed in Britain or in any other country,X am certain, therefore, that the adoption of the alternative of opening the Moray Firth to trawling would be and would be regarded by the public throughout Scotland as a national misfortune.     The only effect would be some immediate gain to the Trawling Companies, rapidly dwindling as over-fishing led to depletion of the,Moray Firth grounds.It is noteworthy that, in 1929, my predecessor (Sir John Gilmour) felt bound, in face of opposition, to reject a proposal that part of the Firth of Clyde should be opened to British trawlers during part of the year*     My colleagues will realise that any proposal to open the Moray Firth would asmaifig opposition much more intense than that-    to which Sir John Giimour yielded.9, In Interdepartmental discussions the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries has raised objection on the ground that my proposal to seek recognition of the nor ay Firth, as part of &quot;the exclusive, fishery limits&quot; is likely to result in the putting forward of analogous claims by other nations, in particular, Denmark and Norway.     I agree that this is a point to be considered, although my fishery experts regard, the estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries as
excessire,applying a careful method of computation to the date available my advisers are of opinion that 20,000 tons is an outside estimate of the catch of English and Scottish trawlers in Bays in Iceland which mif^at be regarded as geographically comparable with the Moray Firth.     So far as the point is relevant, it may be mentioned that this amount (SO, 000 tons) is less than the maximum oat oh (about 25,000 tons) in the Moray Firth in the period under review.     The areas off Farc-e and the Murmansk Coast, which the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries has mentioned in our discussions, are not. properly bays at all and are, therefore, not even geographically comparable with the Moray Firth,In the case of. the Bays in  Ja^jaad        fiurthav question arises whether the adjoining State has the same just and reasonable claim to treat these Bays as part of&quot;^^g^q^Sjjjg..^!6, f * sjae.^y^l.*5y^Et? &amp;s exists, in my judgment, in the case of the Moray Firth,     If it has , then 1 venture to submit that it will be impossible to justify indefinitely a denial of that claim merely because the maximum exploitation of the Bays in Iceland is of financial advantage to English and Scottish trawling interests.     In that event the remady of the trawlers will be to make greater use of the new fishing grounds In the open seas which the new Research Vessel is to help to explore;   and to conserve t&amp;c nupply of fish for the market by adopting better methods of handling, refrigeration, ate.If, however, Iceland cannot make out a just and reasonable claim to the recognition of her Bays as. Mego^usixe, fishery limits&quot; any argument based on a comparison between those Bays and the Moray Firth is fallacious,.0* In Inter-Departmental discussions it has also beensuggested that the policy of recognition of the Moray Firth aa&quot;exclusive/(eh
&quot;exclusive fishery Ximite&quot; should not he adopted &quot;because it may prevent this country from maintaining at the next International Conference on Territorial Waters or otherwise the policy of restricting Territorial Waters to a minimum.My answer to that suggestion is as follows:-At the International Conference on Territorial Waters held at She Hague in 1930 this country sought to get ether nations to agree to narrow limits of Territorial Waters -substantially the &quot;3-mile limit&quot; on the open coast combined with a special rule in the case of all bays and.with, the principle that certain large inlets may be recognised as part of the national territory.     On the last mentioned point X indicated in 1930 my preference that an attempt should be made at the International Conference to secure immediate recognition of the Moray Firth and the Firth of -Clyde, as National Waters.       But as it appeared that the&apos; Conference would net be prepared at the Session of 1930 to undertake the lengthy task of dealing with claims to the Scottish firths and similar claims from other countries, 1 accepted the proposal that the United Kingdom Delegates :should recommend the setting up of a small body to investigate these claims and to report to a future session of the Conference,      A special communication on this point was sent by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the British Delegation as a result of the discussion in the Cabinet on 12th March, 3.930,     If the small body had been appointed as propefsed it is reasonable to suppose that a claim to full territorial rights in the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde would by this time have been presented to it.The Conference of 1930 broke down on   major issues ass it seems plain that at the next Conference on Territorial Waters International agreement will only be attainable if wider limits of territorial jurisdiction than H0MC Governmentput/
put forward in X93Q are adopted for all or for certain purposes.     This circumstance, in ray view, will strengthen the case for claiming full territorial righto in the Moray Firth and :*firth  of Clyde at the next International Conference on Territorial Waters (some years hence) la aceordanoe with the  ord Advocated statement in the House of&apos;Commons on 3rd June, 1931 *     In that statement, after referring to the observations of eminent Judicial Authoritiesf the Lord Advocate said &quot;I think it may quite properly be said, therefore, although it ai$rt be disputed by foreign countries, that the Moray Firth, la within the territorial, jurisdiction of this country&quot;0In tha meantimee however, the immediate question is simply whether the smaller claim to &quot;exclusive fishery rights&quot; in the Moray Firth and the  &quot;firth  of Clyde should be made at an International Fisheries Conference in the near future, and 1 submit that the position in regard to territorial waters generally furnishes no justification for foregoing &apos;Kx%t claim,I do not think it will be disputed that some of the Dominions will undoubtedly press claims to the recognition as territorial, inlets of numerous inlets similar to tha Moray Firth,,     At the Imperial Conference in 1923 they accepted a recommendation that the general policy of the Empire should be the R3-mile limit&quot; on the open coast combined with the qualification that &quot;territorial rights may, in addition, be admitted in respect of a certain number of larger bays or inlets to be known as territorial inlets -which should be specifically enumerated and geographically defined.19Since 1923 several of the Dominions have forwarded to/111 ) o
to this Government lists of claims to inlets which are similar to the Moray Firth and I submit that those claims indicate that the question of &quot;territorial inlets&quot; cannot he disposed of on a narrow &quot;basis even though a narrow basis might suit the interests of the Ministry of Agriculture ana Fisheries and other Departments,IS o My colleagues may remember that in the case of norway,        Baldwin5s Government negotiated in I9 3-6 a Br&amp;ffc Convention with Norway in which H,M. Government proposed to recognise the large Vest and Var&amp;ngQr Fjords as part of Norwegian territory in return for, the ^acceptance by Norway of a, 3 mile limit instead of the 4 mile limit which she claims0 Eventually the Norwegian Government decided to rejsot the Convention because they would not give v.z- their claim to a 4 mile limit.     This, however, is a clear instance of the  , acceptance by this country of the principle of recognising territorial Inlets though the recognition was to be in favour of a foreign country and not   in f&amp;vour of a part of Great Britain.     I may add that I consider that the decision of the late Government to excltads the Moray Firth from the scope of the negotiations with Norway in 1925=6 was unsound, especiallyiin view of the offer to recognise the Norwegian Fjords,13o The present Government have recently conceded ameasure of recognition to the claims of a foreign country to exclusive fishery rights6   The Temporary Fisheries8 Agreement dated 22nd May 1930, between H8M, Government and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics includes a provision that &quot;A3 re-gards the White Sea, fishing operations by fishing boats registered at ports of the United Kingdom may be carried on to the north of latitudeS80 10&quot; N. outside a distance of 3 miles from the land68.     The agreement contains an express reservatior
of the views held by each party as to the limits of territorial waters in international law,, and it is expressly temporary pending a formal Gosrrention,   But the provision quoted seems olearly to imply exclusion, for the time being, of British fish-ing boats from the $hits Sea south of 689 10B B. i,e0, an area of the White Sea enclosed by a line about 100 miles across.Having answered what I understsmd to be the chief objections to my proposal, 2 briefly mention a conceivable, but less satisfactory, alternative.Under Section 10 of the Sea Fisheries. Regulation (Scotland) Act, 1395, which was passed by Lord Hosebery&apos;a Government, Byelaws may be made prohibiting trawling in any area or areas under the jurisdiction of Hie- Majesty -within IS miles of the Scottish ooast (to be defined in.such -Byelaars) subject to a proviso that no area of sea within the said limit of 13 miles is to be deemed to be under the jurisdiction of His Majesty for the purpose 03*.the Section unless the powers conferred thereby have been accepted as binding on their own subjects with respect to such area by the Powers who signed the North Sea Convention, 1883,The opportunity of the proposed North Sea Conference might be taken to seek the assent of the North Sea Powers to an application of Section 10.to a belt of waters, 13 miles wide, stretching along the coasts of the Moray Firth,     This would olose the inner part of the Moray Firth entirely to trawi^ ing and would afford some protection in the outer part.   Such partial closure would, however, be muoh less satisfactory than total closure from my standpoint, and I strongly prefer the policy of securing recognition of the Moray Firth as part of the &quot;exclusive f1sherylimltsw,
15. If it were decided not to pet forward that policy should he opposed to participation of this oountry in the North Sea Fisheries Conference suggested by the Netherlands Government,     My reason is that it would be useless and inexpedient to discuss the question of minor alterations in the Articles of the existing Convention (e,g, by inserting express references to cod-nets) if the major question of the effective closure of the Moray Firth to trawling is to be left unsolved.I believe that the Government would be faced with intense criticism from all quarters in Scotland if their Delegates wen&apos;y to the Conference debarred from pressing for effective closure of the Moray Firth,16, Apart from the foregoing general question twospecial   matters are at presant under discussion between my Department and the other departments concerned, namely(l) The question of seeking redress fss the losses of sear sustained by the Moray Firth cod-net fishermen this year(S?.) Possible arrangements for securing more effective protection of the cod-nets in 1932,These question will be adjusted departraent&amp;lly so far as possible.     But the nature of the representations to be made to the Netherlands Government about these special matters may depend largely upon the decision of the Cabinet upon the general questions raised above,1?0 X submit for decision the proposals on.generalpolios&quot; which 1 make in paragraph ? above briefly as follows(!) That the Government should maintain the closure of the Moray Firth to Trawling, and should aim at making iteffective/
effective against foreigners,(2) that the Government should participate in an International Conference for revision of the North Sea Fisheries Convention, 1Q82, upon the footing that the British Delegates should press at that Conference the proposal that the Moray Firth should he reoognlsed in the amended North Sea Convention as within &quot;thenexclugi ye,,fishery 1imits of the British,,,Isles&quot; without prejudice to the question of a claim to general territorial jurisdiction over the Moray Firth at a future international Conference on Territorial Waters (which may he held a few years hence) ,(3) that the Government should refrain from any admission that the Moray Firth is part of the High Seas,(4) that the same policy should he followed In regard to the Firth of Clyde if the scope of the North Sea Convention should be enlarged so as to include the area which embraces the Firth of Clyde,WL0 ABAtSSGXr,SCOTTISH OFF!OB,33rd July, 1931,
