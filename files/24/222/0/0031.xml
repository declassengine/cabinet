jfTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S (TOVEBNMENT. ) SECRET&apos; COPY NO.   j)Q.P.lOl(3l)CABINET. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL. Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour.L. At their meeting on the 17th July the UnemploymentInsurance Committee came to the conclusion that clause l( 2) (a) of the Unemployment Insurance (No.. 3.) Bill should be dropped.  (See.C.P.180(31).      The Chancellor of the Exchequer has intimated that he dissents from this conclu-sion and has asked that an alternative clause should be submitted for consideration.    The appended draft is accordingly circulated.    (Appendix 1.)2.. The effect of this draft would be that the power toreduce benefit on account of earnings would be limited to cases where the earnings both in the preceding calendar-week and on the average in the preceding four weeks exceeded! one and a half times (or twice)  the claimants rate of benefit (including dependants benefit) for a full week. Further,  the deduction f rom b enef it is not to exceed half the excess of the average earnings for the four weeks over one and a half times (or twice)  the claimant&apos;s rate of benefit for a full week.  (&quot;One and a half times&apos;1 and &quot;twice&quot; are alternatives submitted for consideration.)3. Some illustrations of the way this would work aregiven in the Appendices IlandJII.    A man with a wife and two children (weekly benefit 30/-) would not be affected unless he received earnings of over 45/- (or  3) in the preceding calendar week and also averaged over 45/- (or  3)
in the    four preceding calendar weeks.    The corresponding figure for a single man is 25/S (or 34/-)  and for a single women 22/6 (or 30/-).4. The draft differs from the words now in the Eill asfollows:-(i) The draft fixes a minimum amount of earnings instead of leaving the amount quite open;(ii) The draft requires that the minimum earnings must have &quot;been received both in the preceding week and on average in the preceding four weeks;  in the Bill  the period to be covered is left quite indefinite;(iii) The draft limits the maximum deduction that may be made from benefit instead- of leaving it open-5c It should be noted that the various limitations indicate the &quot;least favourable treatment that may be given to a claimant * The actual Regulations may give more favourable treatment5 either generally or in particular classes of cases, if this is thought to be the right course after the advice of the Committee has been taken.6. If a minimum amount of earnings has to be put in the Bilit Is thought to be &quot;better to use the benefit rate rather than specify a figure, which might be regarded as some sort of a &quot;minimum wage&quot;.    The method adopted in the draft has the advan-tage, moreover.,  of avoiding the difficulty of fixing so par a fee figures for women, boys, girls&amp;c., and also that of giving more favour-able treatment to married men than to single men-7. The draft would, of course, limit very considerably thopotential restrictions on benefit as compared with the existing clause.    Hot/ far it limits the restrictions which would In practice be found, possible must be a matter of uncertainty.
