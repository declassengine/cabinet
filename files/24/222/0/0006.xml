s DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OB&apos; HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY4S GOVERNMENT)CREIp. 155  (31)CABINS TPUBLIC OFFICES (SITES) AMENDMENT BILL Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.In accordance with the decision reached on the isth March 1950, a Bill to amend the building line laid clown in Section 14 of the public Offices (Sites) Act &quot;*912 was introduced in the House of Commons on the 9th February &quot;*931, and, after second reading, was referred to a Joint Committee of Lords and Commons.    (Before the Bill was introduced it was decided by the Treasury that the rate of interest payable to the Commissioners of Crown Lands for the consideration on the vesting of the &quot;Northern&quot; lands, viz: the northern portion of the Whitehall Gardens site, should, instead of being charged at the rate of three and a half per cent, per annum, as pi-provided by Section 5 of the principal Act, be charged at the rate of four and a half per cento, and provision was accordingly made In the amending Bill for the increased rate of interest In addition to the removal of the building line restriction).The Joint Committee to which this Bill was referred have decided, by a majority, that Clause 2 of the Bill (whieh provides for the amendment of the statutory building line) should be struck out,,    This, In effect, means that,  so far as the portion of the site upon which Nos. 1-10, Whitehall Gardens at present stand, i.ec excluding the Montagu House site, the department would not be able to builc on the Embankment (or Eastern) frontage in advance of the statutory building line which is shown on the plan Go8 which, accompanied my memorandum of the 26th February 1930 (cp 67 (SO)).While it might be possible to secure the passage of the
Bill, as originally drafted, through the House of Commons by asking for the reinstatement of Clause 2 on consideration of the Report of the Joint Committee, the House of Lords would In all probability insist on the deletion of Clause 2, as recocroen&amp;ed by the joint 0o;22ittee.    I think it would be advisable therefore to accept the majority decision of the Ctoamisslon.Although there is no statutory restriction against building on the iiontagu House portion of the site in advance of a line in continuation of the building line laid 6.01m In 1912 for Whitehall Gardens, I a&amp; of the opinion that It would be inexpedient to adopt this course.    Quite apart from architectural considerations, it is clear from the debate on the 3rd reading of the 1912 Bill that the Select Committee to which that Bill was referred., were largely influenced in agreeing to the building line then laid down for the Whitehall Gardens site by the understanding that it would be eon-aider ed as the building line for the Babantoent, when the tiae came to build on the present site of Montagu House and Richmond Terrace.The Treasury do not consider it necessary or desirables ia the altered circumstances, to obtain the sanction of Parliament to increasing the rate of Interest in respect of the consideration payable on the vesting of the &quot;Northern&quot; lands in the Commissioners of Works - the only other purpose of the Bill.    I propose, therefore, that the present Bill be withdrawn and that the whole question of the future development of this site be considered de novo In the light of the decision of the Joint Committee regarding the building line on the Embankment frontage.Go LoHoHo Office &apos; of /c/orks etc. -----------! 19th June,  1931.2 o
