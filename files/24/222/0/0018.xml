Copy No.   851056-B.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE,IMPERIAL DEFENCE PREPARATIONS. (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1055-B.)The Basis of Service Estimates.Memorandum by the Foreign Office.THE Foreign Office have been asked to prepare a memorandum on the question whether it can still be safely assumed, for the purpose of framing the estimates of the Fighting Services, that there will be no major war for ten years.The question is such a considerable one, and of so great importance, that it can only be dealt with thoroughly. It cannot be dealt with at all without an abbreviated excursion into the fields of European psychology. For the purposes of this review, however, and for all the brevity possible, another assumption will be made: to wit, that there is no need to dwell at length upon the strong peace equipments of Geneva and The Hague, or upon such weighty instruments of tranquillity as the Kellogg Pact and the Treaties of Locarno. These have been many times reviewed, and are still in process of furbishing, and increase. They, and all that they stand for, are the corner-stone of our policy, and the hope of safety for our civilisation. There can be no question of underrating their value and importance; and it is in the faith of them that we have recently instructed our representatives abroad to combat the loose scare-mongering of last year. No suggestion of the &quot; inevitable recurrence &quot; of war can be allowed, let alone made. It will also be taken for granted that there is no need to say more of &quot; The Foreign Policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom together with a List of Commit-ments arising out of that Policy or the Foreign Policy of other Nations,&quot; written and issued concurrently with this memorandum. Lastly, it will be assumed that there is no need to explain in detail the dualism of the modern world, that is the recent recovery and growth of the old Adam alongside of our more hopeful developments. These phenomena have been reviewed in several papers. It will be sufficient to say here that their principal features are most apparent, and indeed are a matter of common and incontrovertible observation, in Germany,. Italy and, above all, in Russia. A fair text for this paper may be taken from the most recent speech of M. Vandervelcle, who is under no suspicion of excess in either direction. He said that he was &quot; unable to believe in the impossibility of war. He thought that the forces of good in the world might succeed in averting it, but he was fully cognisant of the forces of evil working in the opposite direction.&quot;   This is in the same reasoned spirit as the Secretary of State&apos;ssummary of January:   &quot;The state of Europe is not what it might be.....It is clear that the problems left by the war have not been so completely liquidated as some were inclined to think a&apos; year ago. I do not want to be considered an alarmist in saying this-far from&quot; it.&quot; An attempt is made in this paper also to see the state of Europe as it is. The case is not one for alarm, but it is certainly one for preoccupation, as indicated in the Prime Ministers statement quoted in the conclusion. With this brief preface we may come at once to the enquiry in hand.5904   [5530] *J
An assurance that there will be no major war for ten years depends on flie-assumption (a) That during the next ten years no two nations will be involved in a dispute about a vital interest which pacific means have failed to solve; or(b) That of two nations involved in such dispute one will yet be so aversefrom war as to prefer to abandon its interest rather than fight; or(c) That of two such nations one will be so weak as to be incapable of fightingwith any real hope of success; or(d) That some organisation exists anxious and able to restrain intendingbelligerents; or(e) That a situation does not arise which creates a war psychology.If it can be shown that any one of these five assumptions can be validly applied to the next ten years the assurance in question can be maintained. If on examination all five of these assumptions do not appear to be safely tenable, the assurance that there will be no major war during the next ten years cannot with certainty be given.(a) First Assumption.That during the next ten years no two nations will be involved in a dispute about a vital interest which pacific means have failed to solve.For the purposes of this paper it will be regarded as axiomatic that major wars are fought about major issues. Consideration of the possibility of what might be called accidental wars would be purely speculative.    &apos;Some of the major issues which might become during the next ten years the subject of differences insoluble by pacific means are the following : limitations upon German armament; the eastern frontiers of Germany; the Union of Germany and Austria; Hungarian frontiers; restoration of the Habsburgs to the Throne of Hungary; Bulgarian frontiers; Italian ambitions in Albania and in the Danube Basin; hostility of Soviet policy towards Europe. This list is not complete, nor can the degree of imjjortance attached to each item by the unsatisfied Power be accurately estimated, for this varies with change of circum-stances; but the significance of the list is sufficiently plain, and, leaving Russia for the moment out of account, can be simply expressed in the proposition that the Powers defeated in the last war, with Italy now added to them, are deeply dissatisfied with the Peace Settlement and with their apparent inability, short of force or the threat of force, to alter it.The least important of the countries named in the preceding paragraph is Bulgaria. Bulgaria wishes for a revision of her frontiers which would restore to her some of the districts lost since the second Balkan war, including a port on the ^aegean coast, and, what is more important, the rescue of the &quot; Macedonian nation &quot; from absorption by Yugoslavia, and its recognition by Europe as the twin sister of the &quot; Bulgarian nation.&quot; The degree of her dissatisfaction and the manner in which it is expressed have not altered. Her resources are small, her economic difficulties great, and her principal opponents, Greece and Yugoslavia, are, and are likely to remain, more powerful than herself. So far, therefore, as Bulgaria is concerned, there is no more reason to-day than there was in 1920 to anticipate aggressive action. But it is a tall order to guarantee long-term peace where there is so much loose Nationalism and Irredentism, which, failing satisfaction, have often burst from control in the past. Among many instances of the war mentality in the Balkans one might adduce the opposition of M. Marinkovitch one of the best minds in Yugoslavia to a proposed amendment of the Covenant, on the ground that it would make it impossible for Yugoslavia to avail herself of article 15, paragraph 7, in order to go to war with Bulgaria over the Macedonian question.Hungary, like Bulgaria, is deterred from any attempt to recover (her late provinces by her own weakness and the strength of the opposition she would have to face. But she will probably not hesitate to use any and every opportunity, either peaceful or military, to recover her lost provinces if ever circumstances become favourable to her. In fact, this is a vital and enduring interest for Hungary, and, with the Little Entente ranged against her for the express purpose
of resisting that vital interest, it would be rash to say that the fundamental conflict thus created between Hungary and her almost equally rough and ready neighbours will, during the next ten years, either lie dormant or be settled by peaceful means. One form taken by this conflict is the question of a Habsburg restoration. Opposition to this by the Little Entente is as determined as ever; but opposition on the part of the Great Powers has weakened, and it is unlikely that the United Kingdom or Italy or Japan would in present circumstances wish forcibly to re-enact the embargo on the Habsburgs by the Conference of Ambassadors in July 1921.If at first sight it seems an exaggeration to include the restless and variable ambitions of Italy among vital issues liable to lead to war, this is rather because of the known military weakness of Italy and of the changing nature of her ambitions than because full reliance can as yet be placed upon moderation in the conduct of Italian policy. If Italy&apos;s vague desires to assert herself in South-Eastern Europe were focussed by events on one particular issue, such as the maintenance of her influence in Albania, if her military strength in comparison with France were increased, if, owing to some change in her internal condition, the Fascist administration were further impelled upon a policy of prestige and all these things are within the bounds of possibility she might well become again as intractable as she showed herself to be when Fiume was at stake. Therefore, although the object of Italian policy can never be precisely defined, its nature must be included among conceivable causes of war.In this respect, as in many others, Russia is comparable with Italy. We shall speak of Russia at greater length later; here it is only necessary to say that hatred of foreign &quot;imperialism and capitalism,&quot; deep suspicion of foreign Governments and the doctrine of inevitable war, are disagreeably strong and widely diffused in the U.S.S.R. This passionate propaganda may stale, and burn itself out by unfulfilled iteration; meanwhile we must take account of its effect on a generation that has heard no other account of its surroundings.Whatever differences of opinion may be held about the nature of the issues relating to Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy and Russia, there can be no question at all but that Germany regards it as vital to her life as a State to bring about an alteration of the Eastern frontiers, and to free herself from any system for the limitation of armaments which does not apply equally to other Powers; and there are indications that German public opinion in the aggregate has recently directed a closer and more impatient attention to these subjects than at any time since the Armistice. Treaty revision is, in fact, on the programme of practically all political parties in Germany. So relatively moderate a person as Dr. Kaas, leader of the Centre party, has stated that &quot; the idea of revision and evolution is alive and will not disappear again from the political agenda.&quot; And, again, in a &quot;Times&quot; report of the 29th December, 1930, &quot;Dr. Kaas says there is &apos; danger in delay.&apos; There is still hope in Germany, at any rate in those circles which have so far supported the policy of understanding and from the responsible majority. The critical phase for Europe will begin &apos; when Germany ceases to hope.&apos; ; The German Samson will not allow himself to be tied for life to the treadmill of Versailles.&apos; &quot; Or, in Herr Seldte&apos;s more flamboyant stuff of the 31st May : &quot;We will never rest until all German soil that has drunk the blood and sweat of numerous German generations has come back to the Reich.&quot; This development seems to be the result of two changes in the condition of the German people. On the one hand, the admission of the Reich to membership of the League of Nations, the Reparations Settlement, the evacuation of the Rhineland and the removal of the Commission of Control have raised the international status of Germany, deprived France of the power to take immediate reprisals for any anti-French move, concentrated attention on other and more enduring results of the war, and whetted her appetite for equality with France and superiority over Poland. On the other hand, the economic depression has increased public discontent, made it expedient for the Government to deflect this discontent on to the errors of the Treaty of Versailles, and to appear more active than formerly in the pursuit of what is called &quot; the policy of liberation.&quot; It has also strengthened, and is likely to continue to strengthen, the extreme parties in the State, i.e., the Nazis and the Communists, both pledged to wholesale repudiation of the peace settlement and reparations. The advent of either of them to power would thus at once create a dispute with France and Poland, which would certainly turn on the most vital interests of those concerned.   Economic distress is undoubtedly[5530] b 2
a fundamental cause of German unrest, and the hope is sometimes held out that an economic revival would rob Hitler of his influence, while an economic understanding with France would moderate the political pretensions of republican opinion in Germany. But until such improvements have occurred and their political effects have been measured we cannot dismiss from the list of vital issues, within the meaning of our first assumption, the Eastern frontier and the limitations upon German armament.There are no indications whatever at present that Yugoslavia and Bulgaria would negotiate a revision of the Bulgarian frontiers, that the Little Entente would negotiate a revision of the Hungarian frontiers or assent to a Habsburg restoration, that Poland will negotiate a revision of the Eastern frontier of Germany, or that France will agree to anything approaching parity of armament with Germany. Therefore, the assumption that during the next ten years no two nations will be involved in a dispute about a vital interest which pacific means have failed to solve cannot be made with the same assurance as in 1920.*(b) Second Assumption.That of two nations involved in such dispute one ivill yet be so averse to war as to prefer to abandon its interest rather than fight.This assumption raises an aspect of public sentiment of particular interest, because it was, among other things, upon a very general aversion from war on the part of those who have lived through it that the assurance that no major wai would break out for ten years was justifiably first given and reiterated. The aversion was strongest in the months immediately succeeding the Armistice, and: it affected most powerfully those avIio had experienced most fully the horrors of Avar. It was so strong that troops of the highest quality became insubordinate at the prospect of a prolongation of service with the colours; it is still strong, and its strength is demonstrated by scores of resolutions passed by religious bodies and by branches of the British Legion, by the flourishing condition of the League of Nations Union, by the size of its membership and financial resources, by the large numbers of generals and admirals whose patronage it enjoys, and by the activities of similar societies in foreign countries.Repugnance to Avar is based on instinct, reason and morals. Some feel instinctively that any condition of life is preferable to the trenches; some reason that another war Avould mean the end of civilisation as we know it, and some are deeply moved by the conviction that war for almost any reason is Avrong. The strength of this moral conviction of the iniquity and disaster of Avar is imponderable, but it grows, if slowly, from year to year, concurrently with tie renascence of the .pre-war spirit and of the old Adam, to Avhich attention has already been drawn. The groAvth of a reasoned peace mentality, based on self-interest, is more marked. It is rooted first in a realisation of the destructive power of modern Aveapons, secondly in the anticipation that these weapons Avill be liable to be used against the civilian population as Avell as against the armed forces, and thirdly, in the fear that another general Avar Avould SAvell the attack all along the line upon the ideals of social and religious liberty which are common to all civilised countries except the Soviet Union and Fascist Italy. This fear operates not only upon the upper and middle classes who have interests, however small, a^ested in property, but upon all persons by whom a high a^value is set upon individual liberty as exercised to-day in England in political, economic and religious life. Apprehensions of this kind are not very often and not very loudly expressed, but there is little doubt of their strength or of the useful pressure which they exercise in favour of the pacific settlement of international disputes. The stimulation of these apprehensions is the most signal service rendered by Russia to Europe.* It can, however, be legitimately advanced that the influence of these &quot; pacific means of settlement&quot; may in such events be greater than we can at present foresee. By the established procedure the parties would be faced with every sort of compromise and conciliation, and the subject of dispute would tend to merge with the wider question of maintaining peace, in which every Member of the League would have an interest. It is, of course, possible that the national feeling of one partv would disregard all such expression of world opinion and would risk both the opprobrium and the material dangers of persistence in a breach both of the Pact of Paris and of the Covenant of the League ; but the danger that this would happen is eertainly far less than it was before the League existed.
Although a moral and intellectual repugnance to the use of arms has increased and must continue to increase, there is no doubt that, on the other hand, though in a more limited degree, the instinctive and emotional horror of the sufferings of war weakens and must continue to weaken progressively as the war recedes. Anything else would be contrary to experience. Of the men and women exercising votes in 1942 very many, and those the most vigorous and impetuous, will have grown up without first-hand experience of war. Its terrors will be a vivid tale told by the old and middle-aged. Alongside them its heroisms will also survive, with their more powerful appeal to the imagination of the young. This is already the case with the half-licked and numerous Nazis; for hotheads thrive upon internal difficulties. The recrudescence of an ignorant and unimaginative tolerance of bloodshed already prevalent in German internal politics had anyhow to be anticipated; but matters are made much worse by systems which abroad&apos; imitate the technique, but not the ideals, of the Boy Scouts Movement and the Church Lads Brigade with a deliberate view to inculcation of military spirit. In this, as at several other points, it may be said in no smug spirit that we differ from our neighbours. Force is, indeed, still so prevalent in the domestic affairs of most other countries that it receives insufficient discourage-ment from spreading to external conceptions. Russia again the worst offender  Italy and Germany all exemplify this poisonous activity: the first two by State action, and the third by voluntary associations. The young, the very young, are formed into companies and battalions and trained in the spirit and arts of war. At the present rate mere infants will soon be put into black or red shirts. It may be hoped that moral and intellectual objections to war will restrain the young people of 1942; but it is idle to suppose that the instinctive aversion will affect them as strongly as it affects us, or that instinct and emotion may not vie in these matters with intelligence and conscience.If a referendum were taken in Germany on the reintroduction of conscription in present circumstances and without any alteration in the military establishments of other countries having taken place, the result would at least be doubtful. And is it not equally certain that no French Government, in present circum-stances, could, or would, abolish conscription in France ? Who can suppose that the Polish army would not fight if Russian troops crossed the frontier, that the Italian army would not fight if Albania were overrun by Yugoslav troops, that the French army would mutiny if it were called upon to prevent the fortification by Germany of the neutralised zone, or that a majority of the German people would not be willing to take up arms to free themselves from the obligations of the Treaty of Versailles if they saw a reasonable prospect of victory % A general and equal measure of disarmament would produce quite a new situation, and might allow freer play for every repugnance to war as an instrument of policy. But, whatever else may be achieved in 1932, equality of disarmament is impossible. To seek it, indeed, would probably wreck hope, which must consist, as in other respects, of inducing Germany to see that, if she is to get anywhere in her desires, it must be by stages; and the accomplishment even of the first stage might be of great psychological value.Things, then, being as they are. it cannot reasonably be assumed that, were two nations involved in a dispute about a vital interest which pacific means had failed to solve, one would be so averse from war as to abandon its interest rather than fight. Therefore, an assurance that no major war will take place within the given period cannot be assumed as a certainty on the second of the five assumptions under scrutiny.(c) Third Assumption.That of two nations involved in a dispute about a vital interest and prepared in principle to fight for it, one will be so weak as to be incapable of fighting with any real hope of success.The first two assumptions having been found to be problematical, we must consider the hypothesis that during the next ten years situations may arise in which a nation will become aware that something of vital importance to itself is at stake, will be convinced that this interest cannot   be   protected   or   promoted   by   pacific   means,   and   will   not   be
findisposed in principle to fight for it. A nation so situated must ask itself whether war will be likely to enable it, at the best, to impose its will on its antagonist, or, at the worst, to avoid complete acceptance of its antagonists demands. The position of nations susceptible of finding themselves in such posture during the next decade must now be reviewed, and enquiry made in each case whether either party will be so weak in a military sense as to exclude the possibility of war. If in each case one party would start at a &apos; hopeless disadvantage, there might in modern conditions for historic examples of wars of desperate improvisations are, through modern specialisations, now scarcely applicable be some assurance that no war will take place; otherwise the third assumption falls like the first two.Aside from the aforesaid paraphernalia of peace, it is precisely because one-party has in each case been in a position of hopeless inferiority that wars have not taken place which would otherwise most possibly have broken out during the last twelve years. &quot; Without the League,&quot; said the Norwegian Herr Mowincke-l, recently, &apos;&apos; Europe would not have been able to bear the wrongs inherent in the Treaty of Versailles.&apos;&apos; But, on any showing, another, and in these instances possibly the most material, reason why Germany, Hungary and Bulgaria have-not taken up arms to rid themselves of some of the main provisions of the Peace Treaties is to be found in this inferiority. Relief from the payment of reparations, the recovery of Danzig, parts of Silesia and the Corridor, freedom to increase her armaments are, or have been repeatedly proclaimed as, vital German interests. The recovery of her lost territory and the re-establishment of the monarchy stand in similar relation to vital Hungarian interests. Neither Germany nor Hungary nor Bulgaria could have confidently been declared irrevocably averse in principle from fighting for any of these interests. In no case, however, has a war arising out of any of these aspects of the Peace Treaties seemed even remotely probable, and in each case the ultimate reason for this is found in the hopeless inferiority of the aggrieved party. It will be at once^ apparent that, if we could have an assurance that this hopeless inferiority of the defeated Powers will be maintained for the next ten years, then we should in turn be able to give an assurance that no major war would break out during the next ten years between the victors and the vanquished. The field of possible hostilities would have become limited to those Powers whose armament is limited only by their financial resources.An equalisation of the military resources of the victors and the vanquished may take place either by increase of strength in the latter or a decrease of strength in the former. There is little chance of Bulgaria&apos;s position becoming-stronger in comparison with either Greece or Yugoslavia. A predominantly agricultural State is at a disadvantage compared with a State where agriculture-and industry are more evenly (balanced. No alliance of Bulgaria with either Greece or Yugoslavia is conceivable. An alliance between Greece and Yugoslavia in a war of either with Bulgaria is indeed more probable. Bulgarian resources in money, material and man-power are small compared with the resources of Greece or Yugoslavia. Internal difficulties might of a truth arise in Greece or Yugoslavia that would sensibly weaken either country; but the probability remains that one would come to the rescue of the other were she threatened by Bulgaria. The chances of a war for the protection or promotion of Bulgarian interests during the next ten years may therefore be discounted. Hungary is in similar case; for, though the military weakness of Roumania is comparable with her own, she marches also with Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, and there is no prospect of either remaining passive if the third member of the Little Entente came to grips with Hungary. Internal disturbances might put Czechoslovakia or Yugoslavia temporarily out of action, but the prospect of such a simultaneous event need not be meticulously weighed. But there still remains one way in which Hungary might be made strong, and that would be by an alliance with Italy, united by common hatred of Yugoslavia. Within the last few days there have been strong rumours of a provocative betrothal between the Habsburg boy claimant and the youngest daughter of the King of Italy. The alarm caused by the Italian marriage of the King of Bulgaria may be remembered in this connection.In contrast with what has been said of Bulgaria and Hungary, there are grounds on which a reduction of the existing disparity between the military resources of Germany and those of her possible enemies might not unreasonably
be iooked for during the next ten years, either by an accretion of strength to Germany or by a diminution in the strength of her potential opponents. Germany labours under an immense financial burden; she suffers at present more severely than her powerful neighbours from the economic depression; she is divided by hostile frontiers from some of her most important markets. On the other hand, devaluation and rationalisation have prepared her to take signal advantage of any general economic recovery, she is still one of the most highly-organised and technically efficient economic units in the world, and she ranks high in the possession of those assets which exercise the most enduring influence upon economic strength, namely, natural resources and national character. Though immature as a democracy, her administrative machinery is efficient, her public servants are diligent, though probably less honest than before the war, and some of her statesmen are intelligent and courageous. Her resources in military material are strictly limited, but she is assiduous in the use and better-men t of them and fertile in invention. Her military personnel is equally restricted, but by all legal and some illegal devices military knowledge and training is inculcated into civilians. With such advantages at her disposal it is impossible to conceive that there will be no relative increase during the next ten years in the military strength of a people distinguished by a proud and unquestioning patriotism. With this in mind, Europe recurrently makes her own blotchy flesh creep by remembering the traditional ties, both commercial and political, between Germany and Russia, and pointing to the parties that would have Germany go east.There seems at first sight no reason to anticipate a weakening of the military strength of Germany&apos;s opponents. Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia may have their ups and downs, but mere progress of time tends to consolidate their national life, and no loosening of the ties which bind them to France can at present be assumed. The recent proposal of an Austro-German Customs Union caused them to weigh carefully their economic and political interests, now in opposite scales; the political scale has tipped the balance, at any rate for the time being. So far as France herself is concerned, the unsatisfactory features in her political life seem to leave unshaken her power and determination to maintain the military predominance now enjoyed. But for two contingencies the assumption that Germany would for ten years be too weak to go to Avar might not unreasonably have been made. The first of these is that the economic depression may get worse instead of better; that France may share the economic distress and anxiety of less fortunate countries; that she may be driven by poverty to place wealth above national ambitions and suspicions, and the economic exigencies of the moment before political fears for the future. In such circum-stances the Government of France might pass into the hands of a party pledged to a reduction of expenditure in armaments. The second contingency Avould arise were a series of disarmament conferences to bring about a substantial and general reduction of armament. The risks of Avar might in&apos;the long run be measurably reduced by such an event; but to the mind at least of the French Right forgetful -of the Covenant and of Locarno one specific and limited result of a series of successful disarmament conferences Avould be to increase Germany&apos;s chances of waging war successfully.Unlike the defeated PoAvers, Italy has liberty to increase her armaments to the limit of her desires and financial resources, but the latter at least are indeed most stringently limited, and it is difficult to conceive uoav, for all the talk about parity, she could within the next ten years be strong enough to have any hope of emerging victorious from a French Avar. Though it has already been indicated that Italy&apos;s ambitions are so vague and so variable that the course into which her restless ambition will lead her defies prediction, the only other war which need be considered is a war bet\areen Italy and Yugo-slavia; and this is one from which, under sufficient provocation, neither party would of a surety be restrained by the fear that it Avould be unsuccessful in single-handed engagement. Nevertheless, the economic and financial condition of Italy is precarious, and it may be hoped against Yugoslav fears that the strain of combat during the next ten years might in fact give her pause, eA^en in the face of strong provocation Avhetiher offered or received.In the case of no country is it more difficult to foi*ecast future possibilities than that of Russia. Russia maintains the largest standing army in the world  700,000 men, including G-.P.U. and escort troops.   If the territorial army or
militia be included the total is about 2,000,000. She can also find money for the latest mechanical aids to warfare such as tanks and aircraft. Moreover, her forces seem to be organised for offensive rather than defensive purposes. The Air Force, for example, also growing to be the largest of our time, consists mainly of long-distance day-bomber reconnaissance aircraft, not of defensive fighter machines. In one way or another Russia has during the last few years devoted more effort to preparation for war than any other country. A recent British visitor, in his report on Technical Education in Russia, says : &quot;Men and women students alike were seen carrying out rifle drill, and every institution has its military section with its array of gas masks and other forms-of frightfulness.&quot;&apos; The curve of Russian military expenditure has accordingly risen higher and more sharply than that of any other country. Her military budget has grown threefold since 1924-25. The Osoaviakhim a league for stimulating the martial spirit of the people and encouraging every kind of preparation, particularly chemical and aerial, for war is increasing its membership from 7 millions in 1930 to a planned 21 millions in 1933. Soviet policy, in fact like the Communist creed  remains fundamentally aggressive as ever, and though this aggressiveness is not likely, for the present at least, to take the form of military adventure, this is merely because the Soviet dictators are anxious not to interfere with the prosecution of the five-year plan, and because they consider that their end, namely, the destruction of the European structure in its present form, may possibly be achieved with less risk by the policy of propaganda, economic development and the encouragement of other discontented elements in Europe, than by open hostilities. But it would be indeed an abuse of the &quot; Liberty of Prophesying &quot; to venture that in the course of the next ten years discontent at home or the chance of seizing an opportunity to take sides in some civil conflict in a neighbouring country will not induce the Soviet authorities to test the strength of the mighty machine they are forging. The Soviet Government have made overtures to Italy,. even proposing a military alliance, and though Mussolini and his Government have hitherto kept the Ltalo-Soviet Entente on a strictly economic basis, they could apparently secure more for the asking, if they should decide, for reasons of their own. to embark upon a more aggressive policy. Further, the Soviet Govern-ment have strained every nerve to keep Gerrmury and Turkey apart from the Western Powers. Turkey, like Roumania, lives in apprehension of Russian militarism, which in part explains her recent overtures to us.On this point, then, it can, and must, be said that no assumption of Soviet quiescence for so long a period as ten years would be warranted. That is certainly the opinion of Europe; and, in consequence, the Russian is like to be no less than the German difficulty at the Disarmament Conference of 1932.It is perhaps permissible to draw attention at this point to one conclusion, of great importance (though not strictly relevant to the purjDose of this paper) which must follow if the arguments used in the preceding paragraphs are valid. It is this, that, while other safeguards are growing, the preservation of peace for ten years may depend&quot; very largely on the maintenance of the military preponderance of France and her allies. Some astonishment might therefore be felt that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be directed towards a general measure of disarmament which in the long run must lead to a restoration of parity between France and. Germany, and as inevitably remove a powerful restraint upon the latter; and it is on such grounds that the disarmament policy of Plis Majesty&apos;s Government is sometimes criticised. The difference of opinion which such criticisms reveal turns, however, upon the question whether a short view or a long view should dictate the policy of the day. Those who favour a short view would keep France so strong that no other Power will try conclusions with her. Those favouring a longer, and of course a wiser, view affirm that, apart from all the other potent reasons which make disarmament desirable, if is absurd to suppose that one of the greatest peoples in the world can be-kept indefinitely in impotence, and. that the organisation of permanent peace can only go forward in a society of nations whose relations are governed, not by the threatened use of force, but by respect for the aspirations and natural rights of the defeated as well as of the victorious Powers. The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government escapes the dilemma thus presented, contemplating the gradual restitution to Germany of power proportionate to her greatness, and endeavouring to make the successive stages of this restitution correspond with and depend upon successive stages in the development of organised peace; so
that, by the time when the so-called &quot; policy of liberation &quot; has been put into execution, the old motives and the old opportunities for private war will have ceased to exist.This policy may be justified not only by reference to the equality of status with other European Powers which Germany legitimately if somewhat impatiently expects to enjoy, but by reference to certain dangers to the security of the United Kingdom which the predominance of France can be seen to entail when viewed from another angle. In some quarters it is considered indelicate to allude to these dangers. France, we are assured, will never deviate from the path of peace. The fevers of adventurous youth have abated and the ambitions of maturity have been satisfied. She desires only to cultivate her garden; to live and let live. There is much to be said for this view; it is a great part, but not the whole, of peace truth, and is not accepted as the whole truth by the people of this country. It is not a view on which an assurance could be given, or would be accepted, that no conflict between the United Kingdom and France during the next ten years is in any circumstance, conceivable. It is true that we have long declared war between the United Kingdom and the United States of America to be &quot; unthinkable,&quot; and that any differentiation in the case of France might, there-fore, appear unreasonable. What, however, we really mean by this unthinkable assumption is that, in the event of so improbable a danger and the improbability exists also in the case of France sufficient concession would be forthcoming on both sides to avert it. We cannot assume that in case of a direct conflict between British and French interests His Majesty&apos;s Government would wish to yield, or even be allowed to yield, to a French superiority complex, already conscious, for the simple reason, if for no other, that it would not be in the interest of the world that this should necessarily be the case. That war between France and the United Kingdom is not &quot; unthinkable&quot; is even laid down by the Treaty of Locarno.A year ago it was remarked in a Foreign Office memorandum that &quot; from being the most insular we have strangely and wisely evolved into the most, indeed into the only, international mind among our contemporaries. In so doing we are ahead of our times. Our strength is needed for much spade work, if the new ideals are to take root.&quot; On the economic side, and in the same vein, may be quoted a recent article by Mr. Keynes : &quot; An international cure is essential, and I see the best hope of remedying-the international slump in the leadership of Great Britain. But if Great Britain is to resume leadership she must be strong and must be believed to be strong.&quot; One may, for instance, doubt whether France would have behaved as she has done at the eleventh hour of naval agreement, if she had attached more substance to our goodwill. It is at least certain that the best hope of maintaining and carrying forward the good work for peace of the last twelve years  encouraging, indeed, when its handicaps, and particularly the American desertion, are considered depends mainly on the groupless weight of this country, because it is the only one that can be counted upon to be applied sanely and impartially.It is, therefore, not only our interests but a world-interest that makes a hegemony undesirable. Some principles of policy are still vital to us. It is not for one moment suggested that France now contemplates the absorption of the Low Countries, that she cherishes hostile designs against ourselves, that she has in mind any continental system prejudicial to British interests, or any abuse of her pre-eminent position. But it is submitted that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot fairly adjudge the prospects of a ten years&apos; immunity from war, or the imminent threat of war, without reference to the fact that a continental Power now occupies a position which has otherwise only twice existed during the last 120 years, namely in 1803 and in 1914. A known necessity of acquiescence cannot be helpful to the pacifism which is the essence of our diplomacy. Much would be changed for the better if France could be persuaded in her own interest for she ever runs great risks by refusing to run small ones to some real reduction in 1932.  But of this there is hitherto small sign.(d) Fourth Assumption.That some organisation exists desirous and capable of restraining intending belligerents.Only the opposition of some other nation or group of nations can restrain from war a Power which, when an issue vital to itself and insoluble by pacific[5530] c
means is at stake, is ready in principle to fight for it, and is strong enough to hope for success in arms. It is clear that no single Power is willing, even if it were able, to assume this vast and perilous responsibility. If the relations between the United States of America and the British Empire had been happier than they have been during the last century, if American opinion had taken a different direction during and immediately after the Great War, it is conceivable that the united power and influence of the two greatest members of international society might have found in their common origin, ideals and interests a motive and means to impose peace upon the Avhole world, until such time as other nations should have finally and effectually abdicated in favour of a League of Nations the right, of private war. As things are there seems no present or visible group of nations both willing and able in all eventualities to prevent an outbreak.To recognise the limitations is not to belittle the influence of the League of Nations. The League can and does focus upon a critical issue all reasonable public opinion; it can and will quell disturbances between minor Powers; it can and does devise machinery, precautions, expedients for solution of great conflicts as well as small; it can and will impose restraints and delay when passions are roused; it can and will oblige an intending belligerent publicly to explain and justify his cause; it can and does give hope for a future not accurately measurable in calendars. It is, as was stated in the introduction, the corner-stone of our policy, and the hope of safety for our civilisation. But what it has not so far been called upon to do, and what it cannot yet be certainly assumed to be capable of doing, is to prevent what would be in effect a civil war within itself; that is to say, an armed clash between two major Powers or two major groups of Powers, not unequally matched, both convinced that an issue vital to their lives as independent nations was at stake, and not yet assuredly freed by experience from the delusion that any real solution can be reached by the wrong road. We have still to gain time in which the old frame of mind may become unnatural to the European anatomy, and the protagonists of a living past stand a rank or two deeper among the ghosts. We can only echo the quotation from M. Vandervelde at the beginning of this paper, and recognise with him that, in the recently illustrated state of European psychology, the fourth assumption is not yet wholly and necessarily tenable for all emergencies.(e) Fifth Assumption.That a situation does not aHse which creates a war psychology.It can, of course, be safely said that except for Russia no European country has at the present time a war psychology that is to say, a willingness to resort to war because it is felt that war is inevitable in the circumstances, needful to the national interest, and praiseworthy as evidence of &quot;patriotism.&quot; But it would not be safe to say that the seeds of such war psychology do not exist in the Europe of to-day. Such seeds are to be found in abundance. First and foremost, in the intense racial nationalism fostered by the Peace Treaties. This nationalism is, of course, no new thing, but it is more diffuse than before the war. And to nationalism must be added the policy of prestige (the policy of fear, for it is usually the same thing) periodically practised by nervous European Govern-ments for internal political reasons. And lastly, there is that popular and ever-present desire for revenge among those defeated in the war, wdiich voices itself in unofficial, and irresponsible, but numerously manned, organisms with, popular demonstrations and secret plottings, for example, the Stahlhelm and the Nazis in Germany, the Awakening Magyars in Hungary, the Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation in Bulgaria, and the Orjuna in Yugoslavia. Such are the seeds of war psychology, which must not be overrated, but which cannot be ignored; what makes them a serious menace is that they are being kept alive by two great forces, both of which are comparatively new phenomena in the govern-ment of humanity first, the practice of propaganda as an &quot; instrument of policy,&quot; which is a legacy of the war; and, secondly, the power of mass suggestion exercised by the popular and largely ill-directed press. No doubt contrary forces, such as war-weariness, desire for co-operation, and the other peace-making influences which have already been examined in this paper, are working, and working well, against them; but it would be rash to say that, on that account, the seeds are assured of sterility for ten years.  So long as these seeds are alive, bad
means is at stake, is ready in principle to light for it, and is strong enough to hope for success in arms. It is clear that no single Power is willing, even if it were able, to assume this vast and perilous responsibility. If the relations between the United States of America and the British Empire had been happier than they have been during the last century, if American opinion had taken a different direction during and immediately after the Great War, it is conceivable that the united power and influence of the two greatest members of international society might have found in their common origin, ideals and interests a motive and means to impose peace upon the whole world, until such time as other nations should have finally and effectually abdicated in favour of a League of Nations the right of private war.

We have still to gain time in which the old frame of mind may become unnatural to the European anatomy, and the protagonists of a living past stand a rank or two deeper among the ghosts. We can only echo the quotation from M.

Such seeds are to be found in abundance. First and foremost, in the intense racial nationalism fostered by the Peace Treaties. This nationalism is, of course, no neAV thing, but it is more diffuse than before the war. And to nationalism must be added the policy of prestige (the policy of fear, for it is usually the same thing) periodically practised by nervous European Govern-ments for internal political reasons. And lastly, there is that popular and ever-present desire for revenge among those defeated in the war, AAThich voices itself in unofficial, and irresponsible, but numerously manned, organisms with, popular demonstrations and secret plottings, for example, the Stahllhelm and the Nazis in Germany, the Awakening Magyars in Hungary, the Macedonian ReA^olutionary Organisation in Bulgaria, and the Orjuna in Yugoslavia. Such are the seeds of Avar psychology, which must not be overrated, but AAdiich cannot be ignored; what makes them a serious menace is that they are being kept alive by two great forces, both of which are comparatively new phenomena in the govern-ment of humanity first, the practice of propaganda as an &quot; instrument of policy,&quot; Avhich is a legacy of the Avar; and, secondly, the power of mass suggestion exercised by the popular and largely ill-directed press. No doubt contrary forces, such as Avar-weariness, desire for co-operation, and the other peace-making influences Avhich have already been examined in this paper, are working, and working Avell, against them; but it would be rash to say that, on that account, the seeds are assured of sterility for ten years.   So long as these seeds are alive, bad
33?soils and seasons are not yet surely incapable of bringing them to growth or harvest.Perhaps a few concrete examples would be useful take, for instance, the Italo-Yugoslav-Albanian triangle. Here you have, on the one hand, a Govern-ment which definitely practises the policy of prestige and uses propaganda as an instrument of government; on the other, you have a country whose whole being is expressed in terms of nationalism, which, in its turn, is manifested in the form of secret societies, plots and assassinations; and between these two you have an apple of discord in the shape of a small, undeveloped, backward country, which each suspects the other (and with some reason) of wishing to control and possibly absorb. The peacemakers of Europe in 1919 recreated Albania out of the dust, but omitted to endow it with those means of survival which are necessary to the struggle for existence in modern Europe. Ever since then His Majesty&apos;s Government have tried to effect some modus vivendi between Italy and Yugoslavia which would enable Albania to subsist in petty independence, but so strong are the forces of nationalism, jealousy and fear which separate the two nations that all efforts at an accommodation have been in vain. It is not necessary here to explain the intricacies of this rivalry; suffice to say that if the King of Albania were to die or be murdered, his disappearance and the ensuing chaos would quite possibly, with the usual aids of propaganda and mass suggestion, bring about the immediate sprouting of a war psychology in both countries.The case of Albania has been mentioned, not because it is an isolated instance of the possibility of war psychology, but because it has not previously figured in this paper, and deserves a mention as one of Europe&apos;s major problems. It would unfortunately be easy to instance other bad soils and existent psychological seeds, for example, the relations between Germany and Poland in respect of the Danzig Corridor and Upper Silesia; between Lithuania and Poland over the question of Vilna: between Hungary and the Little Entente; between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria: and, above all, between the Soviet Government and its Western neighbours. The problems contained in these relationships have already been examined in this paper from other angles, and need not be reviewed again. The only fresh point to be made here is that in every case the political, racial and psychological conditions are such that it cannot well, or yet, be said with certainty that within ten years a situation liable to create a war psychology could not arise in these fields.To sum up, Europe will only settle down by consent under some eventual treaty modification within the framework of the League. It cannot be assumed that this will be necessarily attainable within ten years; and to touch the sore spots prematurely, or with insufficient &quot; preparation,&quot; would probably make matters worse. Peace is at present partly maintained by the hegemony of France and her eastern allies. If it is maintained, an explosion is still eventually conceivable under the impetus of ^ Tazism, Fascism, Bolshevism.the danger of war may, at least in her own eyes, bSp-ven increased thereby; for her envious neighbours and rivals would seem in a position to contest her supremacy with some hope of success. Given time, the growth of the League of Nations spirit and the economic necessity of European co-operation ma3r bring about such a changed state of affairs that no nation either can or will resort to arms. This appears to be the hope of France, and in all sincerity she has adopted the cause of compulsory arbitration and the economic co-operation of European States. But she considers that day still far off. By world-tendency and express commitment we are all in the same boat; but the crew has not yet really learned to pull together, and, owing to the still prevalent group system, is still apt to rush to one side or the other, while Russia makes a business of rocking the boat. Seven years ago it was written in a Foreign Office memorandum, &quot; one half of Europe is dangerously angry, the other dangerously afraid.&quot; The French can thus keep themselves, and are, in a continual state of nerves. Until they are assured of their safety beyond a doubt (not the doubt of impartial observers, but of their own suspicious minds) they are unlikely to disarm in acceptable degree.This consideration makes it necessary to touch on the question of sanctions and article 16 of the Covenant.If, on the other hand, Francetreaty modification,[5530]
The Covenant and the Locarno Treaties between them go very far towards giving to France the security they desire. But the weight aiid value of the guarantees they have received have never been appreciated by the Governments of France or explained by them to the French people. They have thus powerfully helped to undermine confidence in the new system by preaching that it is not enough, and indeed have done so to such an extent that they have made their own and other people believe that it is of no substantial value whatever. This has greatly increased the difficulty of our general policy, which is to foresee and guide on League principles the inevitable process of readjustment. In view, however, of the tendencies outlined in this memorandum, we should not be justified in hope of success within a fixed time-limit, and a short one, as history goes.The course of human affairs is not thus safely or easily predictable. So experienced a man as the late Lord Milner, after his visit to Russia, actually assured the British Government in a memorandum dated the 13th March, 1917 : &quot; As far as the purely political aspect of the matter is concerned, I have formed the opinion that there is a great deal of exaggeration in the talk about revolution, and especially about the alleged disloyalty of the army.&quot; The revolution broke out on that day. The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the late Lord Carnock, wrote on the 30th June, 1914, two days after the Archduke&apos;s murder at Sarajevo, that he did not expect &quot; any further complica-tions &apos;&apos;; and three weeks later, on the 22nd July, he said that he did not think there was the least chance of the War Book being put into operation. And yet Lord Milner put in his report at a moment when there was much speculation as to possible revolution in Russia, and Lord Carnock&apos;s two statements were made during the five weeks&apos; interval which separated the Arcihduke&apos;s murder and the outbreak of war. A similar forecast in high places was delivered on the eve of the Franco-Prussian war. We need go no further back to explain a comprehensible reluctance to prophesy far ahead even in fair weather; and the sky is far from clear. Never, indeed, has the world presented such grave and delicate complications. Europe presents a frozen pattern, held together by the framework of the peace treaties. That the pattern has not been seriously disturbed in the last ten years is due to three main factors :- (1) War-weariness.(2) The military predominance of the victors.(3) The ideal of international justice and the peaceful settlement of disputes, typified by Geneva and The Hague.We obviously cannot rely on the permanence of the first two of these factors. The first is a wasting asset; the second is bound to, and should, undergo modification. There are, moreover, restless countries like Russia and Italy, whose forces are not at present limited by treaty. And we are not yet in sight of the end of the economic depression; nor can we foresee the consequences of its possible endurance, which might well be grave, even-or perhaps especially in hitherto unlikely quarters such as the United States.It is to the third iay&apos; ?r that we in this country pin our faith; but can we give the same abso! ,-&apos;.e and whole-hearted assurance about the mind of other countries? The answer is at least doubtful. The League must have successfully solved at least one major problem of readjustment before we can reasonably express the conviction that, in the words of the Kellogg Pact, dissatisfied nations have really &quot; renounced war as an instrument of national policy.&quot; That Russia certainly has not done so was shown in her scuffle with China.It is a commonplace that the next ten years or so will be the testing time of the League and of mankind. There are questions such as Reparations, the Polish corridor and German armaments that must come up for answers soon. Others, such as that of Russia and the hegemony of France, may wait longer. But it is precisely because the next ten years will be a period of readjustment, a period of major problems, with which the League has yet to be tested and proven, that it is not conscientiously possible to declare ourselves free from all appre-hension of a major war within that period. No such assumption appears to have been made by any other Power despite our healthy lead. There are, unfortunately, enumerable indications to the contrary. Some anxiety on these scores was expressed by the Dominion Representatives at the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 28th November, 1930, and the Prime Minister said in reply that, &quot; although
his disquietude was not yet such as to make him consider that present assumptions regarding defence should be changed, nevertheless he would not like to say that his views would be the same six months hence. In short, what was wanted in considering defence was flexibility and not dogmas.&quot;The assumption in question was reaffirmed a year ago, and it is not unreasonable to ask what specific events in the last twelve months have been of sufficient weight to cause a change of opinion. In the front rank, and apart from the various other elements of unrest recorded in this paper, must be put the continuing and increasing demoralisation due to economic causes a weakness which may, however, cut both ways in preventing violent courses bringing in its train such phenomena as the success of nazism at the German elections last September. Nor should we minimise the fact that the Disarmament Conference of 1932 the most important European conference since Versailles is now clearly seen to be as pregnant with anxiety as with hope. It is therefore the nearer imminence of readjustments in the settlements of 1919 and the heightened emotional tension of Europe in 1931 that have necessitated this careful stock-taking. It has been conscientiously sought to avoid all dogmatism; but the conclusion, if it must be briefly and clearly put, is that what was at the time of giving a justifiable assumption has of late tended rather to become a speculation with hope still predominant, but with doubt shadowing the prospect. The deduction would seem to be that, without any present change of policy, the previous assumption may still be provisionally operative, but that the situation should be thoroughly re-examined in the light of developments in 1932, on which so much must so necessarily depend.If the all-important Conference of that year should fail, if it should end without an agreement being made and in an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust, then indeed it would be difficult to give a confident opinion that for a period of ten years no war would break out. If, on the other hand, the Conference should bring a substantial reduction of the Armaments that now exist, and if as a Tesult it should re-establish a reasonable measure of confidence in the relations between Germany and France, then we should have perhaps better grounds than at any other moment in recent times for expressing the opinion that for ten years we should have peace.Foreign Office, June 25, 1931.
4o Sithis document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;5 government Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   June 1931SECRET. Copy No.     851055-B.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.IMPERIAL DEFENCE PREPARATIONS (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 992-B.)The Basis of Service Estimates.Note by the Secretary.THE Committee of Imperial Defence may like to be reminded of the circum-stances in which decisions have been taken on various occasions since the end of the war to base Service Estimates on the assumption that there will be no great war for ten years.2. The first decision on this subject was taken by the War Cabinet (which had not yet given way to a Peace Cabinet) on the 15th August, 1919. The discussions of the War Cabinet had been preceded four days earlier by a meeting of the Finance Committee of the War Cabinet at which the first suggestion had been made to proceed on the assumption that no great war was to be anticipated within the next ten years, and had been left for discussion between the Prime Minister (Mr. Lloyd George) and the Service Ministers. The pertinent decision of the War Cabinet was as follows : &quot; The Admiralty and the War Office and Air Ministry should work out their Estimates on the following basis : (1) It should be assumed, for framing revised Estimates, that the British Empire will not be engaged in any great war during the next ten years and that no Expeditionary Force is required for this purpose.&apos;&apos;(There were six other decisions which it is unnecessary to reproduce here.)3. The above decision was not made on a scientific review of the prospects of the next ten years. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Balfour) was not present at the meetings either of the Finance Committee or of the War Cabinet at which the matter was discussed. Moreover, material was not available for a scientific appreciation. The Treaty of Versailles was signed but not ratified. None of the other Peace Treaties had yet been completed. The grouping of nations after the chaos of the War could hardly yet be discerned. Very considerable forces were still being maintained in such distant places as the Caucasus, Constantinople, Archangel, Iraq, and the Finance Committee had already discovered that it was imperative to cut down the expenditure on the Fighting&apos; Services. The ten years&apos; formula, therefore, was purely empirical. Its object was to provide a basis for cutting down the huge forces that, amid the uncertainties of the immediate post-war period, were still being maintained by all three Services, and it was not specifically made to apply to subsequent years.4. The next mention of the ten years&apos; period was on the 26th November, 1924 (Cabinet 64 (24), Conclusion 2), when the Chancellor of the Exchequer[5620] b
suggested to the Cabinet that the Committee of Imperial Defence should be asked to undertake the following enquiries : (1) A fresh survey qf the situation as a whole and the dangers to which the British Empire is exposed;(2) The desirability and practicability of renewing the decision taken by the Cabinet Committee on Finance on the 11th August, 1919, that the Fighting Services &quot; should proceed on the assumption that no great war is to be anticipated within the next ten years, although provision should be made for the possible expansion of trained units in case of an emergency arising &quot; ;(3) A review of the cruiser programme, and, after an exploration of the whole situation, submit a Report to the Cabinet.5. As the result of a discussion on this proposal it was left to the Prime Minister to arrange the precise form of the Inquiry and the Terms of Reference after consultation with the Ministers concerned. On the 9th February, 1925 (Cabinet 9 (25), Conclusion 2), the Cabinet appointed a Naval Programme Committee to consider the programme of construction for replacement of Cruisers and other warships. This Committee found that the Naval Power against A\dricb the Admiralty were measuring themselves Avas Japan. They therefore sought the guidance of the Committee of Imperial Defence upon the question of the probability of a Avar Avith Japan in any future period with which it \vas necessary for them to concern themselves. The Conclusions of the Committee of Imperial Defence, AA-hich Avere subsequently ratified by the Cabinet, included the folloAving : &quot; (ii) The Committee accept the view of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that in existing circumstances aggressive action against the British Empire on the part of Japan within the next ten years is not a contingency seriously to be apprehended.The Foreign Office should be responsible for Avarning the Cabinet and the Committee of Imperial Defence of any change in the. international situation in the Far East which Avould necessitate a fresh revieAV of the question.&quot;It will be noted that the above^e Conclusion applied only to the case of Avar with Japan. Subsequently the Admiralty themselves decided to extend the date for the completion of the Naval Base at Singapore until 1937 (C.I.D. Paper-No. 306-C).6. In regard to Air Defence, the Cabinet, at a meeting held on the 3rd December, 1925, approved a recommendation &quot; That the Air Ministry should base their Estimates on the assumption that the completion of the scheme of Air expansion for home defence, approved by the Cabinet and announced in both Houses of Parliament on the 20th June, 1923, is postponed until the year 1935-36 &quot; (Cabinet 57 (25)).At a meeting held on the 11th December, 1929, the Cabinet &quot; approved the proposal of the Secretary of State for Air for a retardation of the expansion scheme at present governing the strength of the Royal Air Force, involving a postponement of the completion of thai scheme until 1938.&quot;   (Cabinet 52 (29).)7. On the 28th July, 1927, the Cabinet approved the following formula as the basis of Army Estimates : &quot; That it shall be assumed, for the purpose of the Estimates, that the British Empire Avill not be engaged in a European Avar during the next ten years, and that the immediate plans of the Army should be based upon preparedness for an extra-European Avar.&quot;It will be noticed that the above decision referred only to a European Avar and applied only to Army Estimates.8. In January 1928 the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs AAras asked to advise the Committee of Imperial Defence, Avho were at the time considering the question of the South African Coast Defences, as to the probable development of the political situation during the next few years.   Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s
opinion, as given in the Report prepared by the Committee of Imperial Defence for the Government of South Africa, was as follows : &quot; The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has informed the Com-mittee that the situation existing with regard to France, Japan, and the United States of America, the only three naval Powers likely to be in a position to attack the South African ports, is, in his opinion, as follows : War with France, to whom good relations with ourselves mean so much, appears inconceivable. Japan has never been more peacefully inclined than at present, and the only thing that would arouse her would be a menace to her own interests in Manchuria. A direct quarrel with the United States may be regarded as something that neither side would contemplate, though a danger might possibly arise if, in a war with a third Power, a naval blockade were instituted which caused inconvenience to United States trade. Such a war with a third Power the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regards as very unlikely, at any rate for some years. He therefore suggests that the Committee of Imperial Defence might safely asstime that no great war was likely to occur during the next ten years.&apos;&apos;9. The subject was again raised in June 1928. At this time no formal decision of the Cabinet or recommendation of the Committee of Imperial Defence was on record, applying the assumption that there would be no war for ten years to the Estimates of all three Services. The original decision of the 15th August, 1919, as we have seen, had not been renewed in subsequent years. Nevertheless, as shown in peiragraphs 4 to 7, the ten years&apos; assumption had been adopted in the particular cases of war with Japan, as governing part of the Navy Estimates, and of a European war as affecting Army Estimates. In June 1928 the Committee of Imperial Defence were asked to consider a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Churchill) on the Basis of Navy Estimates, containing the suggestion &quot; That it should now be laid down as a standing assumption that at any given date there will be no major war for ten years from that date; and that this should rule unless or until, on the initiative of the Foreign Office or one of the Fighting Services, or otherwise, it is decided to alter it:&quot; (C.I.D. Paper No. 891-B.)10. The subject was discussed at the 236tlb Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 5th July, 1928. S&apos;V Austen Chamberlain made important statements as to the political world outlook, in the course of which &apos;&apos; he pointed out that the Foreign Office had the greatest responsibility in advising the Government with regard to the decision of what period of peace might be expected, and that no more expert opinion on such a subject could be obtained anywhere, but it would be impossible for the Foreign Office to give any guarantee in regard to the advice it gave. He recalled how Lord Granville in Mr. Gladstone^ first Government had been told by Lord Hammond, the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office, fourteen days before the outbreak of the Franco-German War that the affairs in Europe had never been more tranquil or peaceful; further, after the experience of 1914, he believed that no Minister could definitely state that war was an impossibility for any given number of years.&quot;   Sir Austen concluded with the following summary :  &apos;&apos; To sum up, if it were not for the present condition of Russia and uncertainty as to future Soviet policy, he would be without any grave doubts that we could reckon on no war of any magnitude occurring during the next ten years.&quot;The Conclusions of the Committee were as follows :  &quot; The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed to recommend (a) That it should be assumed, for the purpose of framing the Estimates of the Fighting Services, that at any given date there will be no major war for ten years.[5620] b 2
-(6) That this assumption should be reviewed annually by the Committee of Imperial Defence before the estimates of the Fighting Services are drawn up, that is to say, not later than the month&quot; of June, and that it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence to remind the Prime Minister of the Conclusion at the appropriate moment and take his instructions as to placing the subject on the Agenda Paper of the Committee.(c) That it shall be the duty of any Department in Flis Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain, no less than the right of the Government of any Dominion, to ask the Committee of Imperial Defence to review the above Conclusion at any other time if, in the opinion of any of them, the circumstances had so changed as to render its application to the then conditions doubtful.&quot;The Cabinet approved the above recommendation. (C.I.D. 239th Meeting, Minute 13.)11. After the change of Government the above Conclusion was reaffirmed by the Committee of Imperial Defence without any serious discussion on the 27th June, 1929 (C.I.D. 243rd Meeting, Minute 3), and again on the 14th July, 1930 (C.I.D. 249th Meeting, Minute 4).12. The subject was next mentioned at a general discussion on Imperial Defence which took place on the 28th November, 1930, immediately after the close of the Imperial Conference, at a meeting at which the Prime Minister was in the Chair and which was attended by the Prime Ministers of Canada and New Zealand as well as by the High Commissioners of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa (C.I.D. 251st Meeting, Minute 3). The principal reference to the subject in the Minutes is as follows :  &apos;&apos; The Chairman then referred to the present assumption underlying-Defence preparations that there should be no war for ten years and that this ten-year period moved forward from day to day. Obviously this was a very convenient basis on which to conduct Defence preparations. As things stood, it could be assumed that we should have ten years to recover our position. Supposing, however, something happened next year which made it appear that the ten-year period was too long, we could reduce the time to a shorter number of years. The situation was that no Government could adopt a policy of peace, coupled with disarmament, on absolutely hard and fast lines. Every morning it was necessary to look round and see what changes had occurred during the night, and he felt bound to say, as one who saw all telegrams that came to his Government from foreign parts, that he sometimes felt rather anxious, although his disquietude was not yet such as to make him consider that present assumptions regarding Defence should be changed. Nevertheless he would not like to say that his views would be the same six months hence. In short, what was wanted in considering Defence was flexibility and not dogmas.&quot;13. In the course of the proceedings of the Three-Party Committee on Disarmament Sir Austen Chamberlain raised the question at the 3rd Meeting-held on the 7th May, 1931, and expressed apprehensions as to whether, in the circumstances of the day, the retention of the ten-years assumption was justifiable. The most important extracts are as follows : &quot; Sir Austen Chamberlain, revertjng to the Foreign Office Review, asked if it would be possible for copies to be circulated to the Committee. He noticed that the Chiefs of Staff, in their Review, referred to the assumption that there would be no major war for ten years from any given date. He had always been very much concerned in adopting this principle as the basis for our Defence policy, but he would remark that it was a policy which imposed a very heavy responsibility on the Foreign Secretary. When this policy had been started there could be no doubt but that it was a perfectly safe one, but he would like to know whether it could be considered equally safe at the present time. It seemed to him that the trend of recent events&apos; in Europe was towards greater unrest, and he was doubtful in his mind whether it was really safe to lay down any hard and fast rules of this kind in view of the changed circumstances.
Mr. Henderson said that a great deal would depend upon whether Germany obtained what she considered was sufficient satisfaction at the Disarmament Conference. If she should fail to get such satisfaction as she considered was her due, then it seemed highly likely that she would firmly demand to re-arm. She would not, he thought, do this semetly, but quite openly, and if such a contingency arose there could be little doubt but that the whole state of Europe would be transformed.In reply to a question from Mr. Lloyd George, who asked whether France would allow such action on the part of Germany, he remarked that this was the whole question in a nut-shell, and therefore everything was being done to take the general policy in the opposite direction of reduction and limitation rather than allow a direct change of this policy.&quot;Later in the meeting, after Sir Samuel Hoare had expressed doubt as to how far the ten-year formula was now valid, the Prime Minister reverted to the question in the following terms : &apos;&apos; Turning to the ten-years rule, he said that, as Sir Austen Chamberlain knew, the policy had been in force when his Government took office in 1929, and had been continued ever since. He emphasised that he and his colleagues were not blind to its limitations, and he would like to tell those members of the Committee who were not present at the Imperial Conference that the questions in Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s mind had been discussed at a Special Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence convened just after the Imperial Conference.&quot;   (D.C. (P.). 3rd Meeting.)14. Sir Austen Chamberlain reverted to the question at the outset of the 4th Meeting of the Three-Party Committee on 14th May, 1931, when he spoke as follows : &quot; He said he had been thinking still more about this question and could not help feeling anxious, in existing circumstances, as to the assumption which formed the basis of the Service Departments&apos; policy that from any given date there would be no war for ten years. The continuance of this assumption put a very great responsibility on the shoulders of the Foreign Secretary, since it was his responsibility to advise the Cabinet in this respect, although he added that once the Cabinet had accepted his advice they would all separately and collectively share this responsibility. He had always thought it was of vital importance that this assumption should be positively reviewed at least once a year, and, looking at the co;&apos;.-rVition of Europe at the present moment, to say nothing of other and more remote parts of the world, he could not help feeling extremely doubtful as to whether it was possible still to affirm this assumption with anything like complete confidence, more particularly since this assumption formed the basis of all our Defence calculations. He could not disguise from the Committee the very con-siderable anxiety which he felt on this matter at the present time.The Prime Minister emphasised what he had already told the Com-mittee at the last meeting, that a very close watch was kept on this particular question, and that it had been discussed at the Committee of Imperial Defence in connection with the Imperial Conference.&quot;As the result of this meeting it was arranged that the Foreign Office should prepare an appreciation as to whether the ten-years assumption was still to be considered tenable.(Signed) M.
