SMP.LOYiwB.KT INSURANCE loMMITTLE.the Unemplsy-The Committeemet for the purpose of considering / ehow effect could best be given to the undertakings of the Minister of Labour and the Secretary of State forlent Insurance   Dominion Affairs in the Debate in the House of Commons fro. 3) Bill.on the Committee stage of the Bill on the 15th July,1931,  that Clause 1 (2)(a) shjuld be reconsidered (SeeHansard Vol. 255, No.  154,  Cols,,  605-609),Various suggestions were discussed.    One was to limit Clause 1 (2)(a) to persons who had earned on theaverage more than (say) 50/- in the past four weeks.Another proposal was to drop Clause 1 (2)(a) and to widenClause 1 (2)(c)  so as to cover persons working less than aweek instead of merely persons working two days a week.Ultimately the Committee reached the conclusion that from both the administrative and political points of view,  thecourse open to the least objection would be to omitparagraph (a) of Section 1(2)  of the Bill.The Committee also agreed that it was important that it should be ns.de clear that the concession involvedin this change in the Bill was in no way attributable tothe opposition of the Independent Labour party but was theon casual andresult of further examination of the effect of the Clause/ part-time workers in the light of representations made in the course of the Debate by supporters of the Government.
The Committee agreed -(l)    That an official amendment to omit section 1 (2)(a) of the Bill should &quot;be prepared in readiness to he handed in on the evening of July 20th for consideration on the Report Stage of the Bill on July 21st,(2)    That the Minister of Labour should circulate to the Members of the Committee the draft of a statement to be made by her on the Report Stage of the Bili, explaining on the lines agreed at the meeting, the Government&apos;s reasons for the deletion of Section 1 (2)(a). For a copy of this Statement see Appendix, s(o)    That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Minister of Labour should confer on the matter with members of the Liberal Opposition and certain supporters of the Government, including Messrs. Dukes and Grenfellox   A.ttached to this Appendix is a summary of recent Ministerial pledges on the subject.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.Y/.-1. 17th July,  1931,

APPENDIX I,Dre.it Stateaent for Report fitage^ onjXlanae 1 (^2)  a) ,The House will remember the discussion that took place in Committee with regard to this paragraph.    A number of points wire raised &quot;by my Hon. Friends the Member for Warring ton and the Member for Gower and others,  and I stated quite definitely what the intention was and promised that,  if the wording of the Clause did not make that clear, I would consider most carefully the statements made and try to make the point clear at a later stage eI have given the most careful consideration tc this matter. As will have been evident already to anyone who followed the Debate in Committee, the point is a most difficult and complicated one.    It was, I think, a general view that no penalty should he imposed on a   man- or a woman who had drawn no more than the ordinary rate of wages for the days worked,  even though this might be a higher sum than the average, provided that he or she was unavoidably unemployed for the rest of the time6    When I attempted to reduce these and other expressions of opinion into words which could be put into the Bill in place of paragraph (a) I found that it was practically impossible to do this,  in the time at my disposal^n such a way as to cover just so much as the House was willing to approve and no more,,The House will have observed that this is the only one of the four paragraphs dealing with different classes of anomaly where the question of earnings comes in,    Everybody knows how varied and, very often, how complicated are the arrangements relating to wages for different localitiese    What I thick the House desires and what I intend is that we shall deal only with cases in which abnormal wages are being earned for the time workedc
It is this which consxitutes an admitted anomaly with which I am pledged to deal, but I have corse to the conclusion that the best thing to do is to take more time in which to examine the objections raised and to make a more precise analysis in relation to specific trades in order to plaoe before the House a more definite proposal about which there can be no ambiguity.,    I wish to make it perfectly plain that I have taken this step in order to meet what I think are the wished cf the House as a whole0
Statements that have &quot;been made describing the class to be dealt with under Glass 1 (2) (a) of the U. I.No.3 Bill.B Royal Commission Interim Report^Para. 110. .-. ,Casual v/orkers.    Many workers?  especially those engaged in the dock industry, obtain their living by casual employment and some of them receive high remuneration for one, two or three days&apos; work in a week and benefit for the other days.Para-113 - Short-time workers.    Claimants who are able to earn relatively high wages although their work is confined to a part of the week and to supplement these wages by benefit for the remaining days.Paragraph 129 - casual workers-and short time workers in receipt of high earnings,2o  House of Commons Debate on Flnancial Resolution for U. 1,310.4 Bill.Lieutenant Commander Kenworthy asked for a statement &quot;that the anomalies to which -reference has been made are not to apply to dock labourers as such,&quot;    The Secretary of State for the Dominions,  in reply,  said &quot;let me, in response to the request, mention immediately the other side, and say that so far as the Government are concerned we not only.know the position of the dock workers and of all that is included in this subject, but we have consulted those who are responsible.    The anomaly&quot; that we deal with, is not the anomaly of the man who is working two days and is available for work on the other four, but
cf the man working two days who does not intend to work the other fo ur.    That is the differences&quot; 3.  The same Debate.The Secretary cf State for the Dominions said &quot;I have no hesitation in saying, regardless of any criticism, that if that man&quot;  (that is the week-end printer) &quot;does habitually work from Friday night to Sunday morning - he does net intend and it is not his business to get work on other days of the week - it v/ould be a perfect injustice to prevent him from receiving benefit for the other days of the week&quot; (there seems to be a misprint here; what is meant is &quot;to allow him to receive benefit&quot;).    &quot;Take the other extreme case of dock labourers; casual workers, tex-tile workers, and those who work two days a week and are willing and anxious to get work for the remaining four days:    are hon. Members opposite going to deprive them of benefit?&quot;4-  Debate on Second Reading of U. I.No.5 Bill.The Secretary of State for War said, &quot;Where it is quite evident that work is systematically got in a way that gives a big return, there should be no claim for benefit on top of that, but there are cases where the intermittent work is purely due to the ordinary accidents of the trade; take for instance the building trade; no-one would dream that this should apply to the building trade.    In the engineering trade, where a
A 9 5* 6 elman might work three days and three nights at a stretch on an engine and then perhaps play for two or three weeks, no-one would dream of stopping his &quot;benefit.&quot; 5.     flebate   in 06jmltteea-,oa JJ.!,^ lfo?,3.Bill...,Miss Bon afieldi       &quot;Lot me explain-what paragraph (a) means to me and to my colleagues.      I would refer the Committee to the speech made by my right hon. Friend the Minister for War on the occasion of the Second Reading on Wednesday,  8th July.&quot;&quot;I say deliberately that I am not in favour of paying &quot;benefit to any man who, by working a short week regularly, &quot;makes double the average wage,    I am not in favour of &quot;paying   a man of that kind unemployment benefit.&quot; The cases that were discussed in connection with the Royal Commission report were the oases specially mentioned, the coal trimmers,  for example, who work intensively for a short time, and certain other classes.    They are included in paragraph fa)  as casual workers regularly earning substantial wages - those are the categories,  and those: only are the categories intended to be covered by Paragraph (a).  &quot;.,.,,..    &quot;That was all that was in our mind,  that particular category of short time and casual workers as against intermittent workers/&apos;Mr.: Lukes:    May I put to the Minister the case of an engineer working    on payment by results, and earning;  in three days,  35s,,  or 40s c  - a married man with a dependant wife and two children?   Ee would be entitled to 153. for three days&apos; unemployment, and would earn at work,  say,    .45s. Lo I understand that that would he regarded as an abnormal case?&quot;.Miss Bondfield:      That point is not settled, and it is exactly one of the points with which the Committee willfvi)
deal.:; . .... &quot;The intention is that the Committee shuuld consider this point as to what must be regarded as abuses of the Fund when people regularly work short time and regularly receive substantial wages.&quot;Mr. David Grenfell :    11 In the mining industry in South Males at the present time three days&apos; wages come to almost exactly 25s0  a week,    A single man would get 25s. plus 8s.  6d0 unemployment benefit for the three  idle days. A married man would get 25s. plus 13s, unemployment benefit. The Minister has led me to believe it is possible that she would allow the Committee to consider whether the 13s. benefit now payable to a married man would continue tu be payable 0&quot;Miss Bcndfield:  :&apos;It will continue to be payable.&quot; Miss Eondf ield:  &quot;&apos;I meant to make it clear that the line of demarcation is not certain categories of industry, but is where  it is habitual cn the part of one, two or any number of persons in the industry to work short-time and earn high wages:&quot;     (An Eon, Member:    &quot;What is habitual ?&quot;-) &quot;That is the point,    I am trying to make the position clear.    It is not intended to deal with the normal case of the ordinary man who occasionally discovers that he is working *n short-time work.    It was never intended to deal with that case.    That was not the class of case before the Royal Commission.    It was the extraordinary case,  the abnormal case, more particularly in relation to docks.&quot; .....  &quot;Rut the point I very definitely put to the Committee is,  that the only class of case with which paragraph  (a)   is intended to deal is that of the abnormal case  of men habitually working short time cr casually,  as distinct from the week-ender, but mainly cases at docks.&quot; Lieut.  Commander Kenwcrthy:    &quot;The Secretary of-State
for the Dominions ......... when I made a speech withreference to dockers.........  got up and said that thosemen were not aimed at at all.......    The Minister ofLabour has harped on the dockers.    It is the dockers who are aimed at.&quot;Miss Bond field;    11.....  a man who is earning goodwages for a part of one week and then is unemployed for other weeks will not be concerned with this Clause. It is a question of regular employment *i;Mr. Dukes:    up on a period of years in the engineering industry, the textile machine shops and the textile industry, people have worked three days a week for two, three and four years.    Is that regarded by the Minister as&apos; habitual short time to be referred to the advisory committee ?;1Miss Bondf ieid ;    111 do not regard the categories that the hon. Member has spoken of as the categories referred to in this Clause, because they are under-employed.    It is the cases that were brought out and regarded all over the country as abuses.    There are the foot-ballers, for instance.    Hon. Members know the categories. &apos;Mr, Thomas;    &quot;I want to state,  as clearly and definitely as I can, and in simple words, what is intended.    In answer to a question put by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Central Hull, who mentioned the case of dockers,  I said that that was not the interpretation and that was not intended.  I repeat that now.&quot;(vail)
