July 1931. SECRET. Copy No.........afjCP. (31) 196.CABINET.AIR  ROUTE  TO  INDIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.1. In continuation of CP. (31) 192 of 24th July, I circulate for the information of my colleagues copy of a telegram which I have nowr received from the Government of India.   I am in entire accordance with their views, which I need develop no further.2. I should like in this connection to draw attention to the Government of India&apos;s suggestion that, in the event of His Majesty&apos;s Government deciding to develop the Arab route, the Trucial island of Abu Musa (which is the property of the Sheikh of Shargah) should be considered in preference to Ras-al-Khaiinah on the mainland. The suggestion is worth exploring, though I should wain my colleagues that there is in existence a Persian claim devoid, it is true, of all justification, but still the subject of discussion in the recent treaty negotiations to sovereignty over Abu Musa. We have never at any time recognised this claim, but its existence should perhaps be taken into account in considering the Government of India&apos;s suggestion which primd facie I should be disposed to regard as attractive.W. B.India Office,27th July 1931.Telegram from Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 25th J uly 1931.Our telegram of the 19th instant, 1790 S.,* and connected correspondence. Air route,.2. We do not seek to traverse the position taken up by the Foreign Office with regard to possibility of extension of existing concessions iu Persia or of Airways with regard to the practicability of the inland route. But we assume that every possible avenue will be explored on the Persian side before development of the Arab route is decided upon.3. Climatic and political objections to development of this route are familiar to His Majesty&apos;s Government and it is unnecessary for us to do more than state our opinion that it is difficult to exaggerate these.4. As we understand proposal for development of Arab route, it is intended to fly direct from Bahrein to Ras-al-Khaimah, and it is cotisecpjently unnecessary at present to contemplate more than establishment and maintenance facilities at Ras-al-Kbaimah. Our experiences there have not been encouraging hitherto, and we are convinced that attempt to secure what is now wanted by persuasive methods in short interval, during which Airways concession in Persia remains operative, is foredoomed to failure. We think, if this attempt is pressed with undue insistence, His Majesty&apos;s Government will find themselves compelled to have recourse to force both for inception and maintenance. We wish it to be quite clearly understood that, in that event, we could not undertake protection of the Airways establishment at Ras-al-Khaimah or elsewhere on the Trucial Coast with Indian forces. Apart from the military and constitutional objections, despatch of these would provoke reaction among Indian* Not circulated. This telegram ran as follows : &quot; Air route. We associate ourselves entirely with the attitude of the India Office representatives and Biscoe at the Interdepartmental Conference, of which proceedings have just reached us.   Our further observations will follow as soon as possible.&quot;211      100   7.31
Muslims which at present juncture we are not prepared to face. We cannot also discard the possibility that insistence by His Majesty&apos;s Government in face of the opposition of Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah might unite Trucial Sheikhs against us, and cause them to seek protection from Ibn Saud.5. At the same time, we do not doubt that, if right methods are used, development of Arab route in time will be achieved, and we think every expedient should be adopted to prevent deadlock, which we otherwise anticipate, from arising. We consider that opposition to establishment of base on island is not likely to be so stubborn as on mainland, and, since we believe that possibilities of Bu Musa have not been examined, we suggest this should now be done.
