Ih order that my colleagues on the Trade Survey Committee may he in a position to appreciate the general principles which have guided this country in its commercial policy and the principal objects aimed at in concluding    commercial treaties and other similar arrangements, I have thought it well to circulate for their information the attached memorandum which was prepared in the Board of Trade under my direction about a year ago and has now been brought up to date (Annex 1). I also append, in accordance with the decision taken hy the Committee at their second meeting,, a full list of all the Treaties and other engagements r*.ow in force under which the right to most-favoured-nation treatment is secured to us, with an indication in each case of the length of notice which would have to he given should His Majesty&apos;s Government decide to denounce any such Treaty with a view to being relieved from the corresponding obligations that the Treaty imposes on this country (Annex 11).Whilst it is, of course, possible to regard these Treaties as hampering our liberty of action in certain respects, it seems to me of primary importance that we should all realise the other side of the picture, that is to say, the security that they afford for our- commercial interests abroad.      It is not, of course, the case that in the absence of,a Commercial Treaty these interests necessarily suffer or that denunciation of a Treaty would necessarily have that effect.      Thus for a
number of years &quot;before the war we had no commercial treaty with Germany and our interests did not in fact suffer very material injury therefrom.      But presumably we should only embark upon a policy of denouncing treaties,  if we intended to mete out to the goods of a particular country or countriestreatment which Treaty obligations at present preclude., The situation that would arise in such circumstances would be one of an entirely different character from that which would exist if there had been no Treaty in force for many years. Once the Treaty was out of the way all our interests would be open to counter attack and the more resentment our subsequent action aroused the more certain and the more violent would that counter attack be0      Our nationals would have no guarantee against discriminatory taxation, or our ships against differential dues, and our goods would be liable to higher customs duties than those of any other country.      The last possibility is no mere idle speculation seeing that many European countries make a practice of applying either over the whole range of their tariffs or over large sections of it rates of duty which are lower in the case of goods originating in countries with which they are in treaty relations or which treat their goods fairly than in the case of goods originating in countries with which no treaties are in force or which adopt measures to which they take exception.We are familiar with the arguments in favour of a policy of Treaty denunciation followed by tariff bargaining, combined with the imposition of a general tariff.      We may not agree with these arguments but the policy is at least comprehensive and differs materially from one of embarking upon a course of Treaty denunciation and bargaining without having in uur
hands the same fiscal weapon in the form of a tariff as is available to other countires.     This ia the more important inasmuch as a larger proportion of the manufactures of this country is destined for exportation than in the case of any-other European country,.      In other words, our r-isic is greater, whether we consider our export trade or our shipping,,      Until and unless this country becomes definitely Protectionist, it would seem more necessary for us than for other countries that we should continue to secure &quot;by Treaty our right to full and unconditional most-favoured-nation treatment and to insist on the full and unqualified observation of their Treaties by other countries.The case of   Russia presents special features and is &quot;being dealt with in separate memoranda in accordance with the conclusions of the Committee at their last meeting.W. GoBoard of Trade, 27th May, 1931.
,ANNEX I.MEMORANDUM ON COMMERCIAL POLICY. I.      The Commercial Treaties which have &quot;been concluded by this country in recent years deal incidentally with a number of minor questions affecting British subjects., British goods and British ships, but are directed in the main to securing (l) equal treatment far our nationals in certain matters, and particularly in the matter of taxation, with nationals of the country concerned, (2) equal treatment for our ships in all matters of navigation with the national shipping of the country concerned, and (3) most-favoured-nation treatment for our goods in all matters of customs treatment including both Customs duties and prohibitions.      It is the third of these aims (which involves the question of commercial policy par excellence) with which this memorandum is mainly concerned. The latter part of the memorandum, however, deals also (a) with the special provisions in recent international engagements relating to prohibitions of importation and (b) with clauses in certain treaties affecting the imposition of internal duties on imported goods.PART. I-.      THE MOST FAVOURED NATION CLAUSE,.2o      The effort to secure most favoured nation treatment for British trade has been part of our Commercial Treaty policy for some hundreds of years.      To take only Commercial Treaties still in force between this country and foreign countries, a form of the most favoured nation clause appears in the oldest still existing Treaty, viz., that concluded with Denmark (and Norway) in the year 1660, although in those days the clause was directed not to securing this treatment for British goods as such but to securing that British merchants sailing to the Dominions of the King of Denmark and Norway or &quot;exercising merchandise therein&quot; should pay no higher duties that those of other nationalities.      It to uld seem that at that period
foreign countries had not embarked on a policy cf differentiating &quot;between merehandise according to origin, &quot;but that they regarded Customs duties as duties imposed on the person.      In securing equal treatment for British merchants the practical object of placing British trade en an equality with its foreign rivals was, however, achieved.      It is worth noting in passing that the clause made exception in favour of Swedes, a very early instance of a form of exception to general most favoured nation treatment which has lasted till this day and is referred to more particularly &quot;below.3.    It is not too much to say that the most favoured nation clause in its widest possible interpretation is and has for long been the aim towards which all our commercial negotiations have been principally directed.      In order to see why this is so it is necessary to consider the objects v^ith which countries enter into Treaty engagements with regard to the customs treatment of their goods.      This object clearly is to remove so far as possible the obstacles to export trade resulting from the action taken by other countries and to minimise so far as possible the competition such exports have to face.      This competition is of two kinds, competition by native industry and competition by other countries exporting to the same marketo      The former can be minimised by limiting the amount of duty v/hich is levied in the country concerned on imported goods with a view to protecting native industry, the latter by securing that no third competing country shall en4^r enjoy special advantages for her goods.4r    Commercial Treaties concluding by foreign countries which possess general Tariffs accordingly contain as a rule stipulations of two kinds.      They embody schedules of the actual maximum duties to be levied by each contry on long lists of articles of major importance to the ather and they contain
further a general stipulation that none of their produce and manufactures shall pay a higher duty than the corresponding produce and manufactures of any other competing foreign country.5o    Stipulation of the first class are, of courses only possible v/here a country has a general customs tariff applicable to a large proportion of the goods it imports, and is prepared to use its customs tariff for the purpose of tariff bargaining, the essence of agreements of this description being that a country is prepared in return for specific customs concessions in favour of its goods to accord specific concessions in favour of the goods of the country with which the agreement is made.      On the other hand, stipulations of the second class do not involve bargaining of the same description.      Nevertheless the fact remains that countries with high tariffs often find difficulties in concluding commercial treaties at all which free trade countries like the United Kingdom do not experience, so that protectionist countries are often deprived in many markets of that most favoured nation treatment which the United Kingdom almost invariably enjoys.      As a result it may bo  aid with some confidence that although the United Kingdom is not   generally in a position to make specific concessions    in favour of another country? it nevertheless enjoys not a worse but a better position than protectionist countries which by virtue of possessing general tariffs have that power.6U    It has to be observed that the most favoured
nation clause on which our commercial policy places its reliance has two sides.    In the first place it secures us against our other foreign competitors,  in enabling our goods to compete in the markets of each country with which It is in force on an aboolutely equal basis.    But In the second place if,  and so far as,  foreign countries arc able to secure by their bargaining power lower rates for any description of goods, than we also by virtue of that clause secure these lower rates.    It is sometimes urged by those who criticise our almost exclusive reliance on the Clause that this.apparent advantage is rendered largely illusory bjr the increased elaboration of foreign tariffs involving very detailed classification. This,  it is argued, places foreign countries in a position to accord benefits in favour of the special products of the countries with which they entex* into negotiation whilst withholding them from products which are of chief interest to the United Kingdom. To this there are two answers.    In the first place it leaves out of account the fact that each country carries on negotiations of the kind with which Europe in particular is familiar not with one or two but with a whole series of countries,  so that it almost inevitably results that in so far as real reductions of tariffs take place they are not limited to one or two specialised products, but extend over a wide field. There is no country in Europe which has so wide a range of exported manufacture as the United Kingdom, and foreign countries would be hard put to it indeed to devise any far reaching reduction of tariff rates which did not accrue to the advantage of British industry or which British industry was not able by
slight adaptation of its methods of manufacture to enjoy.7.    In the second place it is very questionable whether in fact negotiations such as are undertaken in foreign countries do involve substantial reductions from duties which would otherwise have been imposed, though duties after the negotiations are,  of course, lower than before they are initiated,,    On this point reference may be made to the conclusions reached on the matter by the Committee on Industry and Trade appointed in 1924 over which Sir Arthur Balfour presided^    The following passage is taken from pp. 17 and 10 of the final report of the committee.    &quot;It is, however,  frequently urged that Great Britain by its commercial policy has put it beyond its power to conduct a successful negotiation, or to take Its place on a footing of equality among other negotiating countries each of which has something to offer in.the way of tariff reduction in exchange for a corresponding advantage.     This argument appears to derive little support from the report of the Economic Conference,    which by clearly exposing the successive steps of the tariff bargaining process by which the tariffs of the principal countries of continental Europe are normally settled,  shows conclusively that it cannot in the long run lead, and that as a matter of historical fact it has not led,  to a reduction of the general level of tariffs.    The tendency is in the opposite direction,  and this for a very good reason^   Effective tariff bargaining in the ordinary continental sense demands that as a preliminary step tariff rates shall be raised as s s s 2 a   The so-called &quot;World Economic Conference of 1927&quot;*
&quot;Broadly speaking, it may be said that tariff bargaining as a normal method of endeavouring to obtain freer access to foreign markets is only possible if the actual negotiation is preceded by the raising of the tariff on one or both sides for the express purpose of giving a margin for bargaining.    Even ther    as already mentioned, the object is frequently defeated by the growth of vested interests in the interval which refuse to allow the intended reductions to be made, or by the failure of the negotiations for other causes.    The final result of the whole process is more often than not a rise instead of a fall of tariff level,  if the comparison is made not with the purposely inflated rates of the &quot;tarif de combat&quot;, but with those which were actually in force before the first step towards tariff bargaining was taken.S S S H&quot;We can the more unreservedly concur in the condemnation of tariff bargaining on the continental model,  because neither the principles on which the present British Customs tariff is framed, nor those advocated by any of the trade witnesses who have given evidence before us, would admit of Great Britain adopting the continental procedure as a normal method of tariff construction.H K i  S&quot;We do not believe that in the long run the negotiating countries obtain by such methods any material advantage of the only kind which is of interest to British trade, viz., the lowering of the tariff barriers by which overseas commerce is obstructed. Bor do we desire to see the British tariff (for whatever purposes and on whatever principles it may be constructed)
so framed as to permit or require that the rates of duty should be the subject of eventual bargains with foreign countries,&quot;9.    There have,  it is true,  been occasions in which we have been able to secure guarantees in regard to the actual rate of Customs duties to be applied to our goods, but in the absence of a general tariff in this country such occasions are rare.    One or two instances may perhaps be given,  (l) by undertaking to limit the duty on currants to 2/- per ewt. we have secured by Treaty a guarantee as to the duties on a largo proportion of our exports to Greece, a country whose main concern is to find an outlet for her currants.    (2) The duties on a large proportion of our exports to Jugo-Slavia are governed by a Treaty which we were able to conclude owing to the special circumstances that we had claims on that country which we were ready to forego.    These claims arose out  of an older Treaty with Servia to  some of the provisions of which the newly constituted Government of Jugo-Slavia had failed to give effect.    (3) In Siam and Persia we were able to attach to our consent to the grant of tariff autonomy in future certain provisions as to the duties on British goods for a term.j of years.,10.    Apart from these and other similarly exceptional cases our Treaties with foreign countries and the efforts of our commercial policy arc directed to securing for our goods not actual specific rates of duty,  but the lowest rates levied on any like goods from any foreign country whatever.,    Some countries, like ourselves, adopt the system of a single tariff applicable to all foreign countries alike, and in regard to such countries the most favoured nation clause gives nothing immediate though even then it is an insiirance
against a change of policy.     But in a number of countries this is not the case and higher duties are imposed on goods originating in some countries than on goods originating in others.      It is obvious that in such cases it is a vital matter for our export trade to  secure the application to our goods of the lowest rate.11.    The principle is of such importance that in recent years we have consistently declined to conclude any commercial treaty which did not embody this clause.      The last exceptional case occurred in 1882 when we concluded with France a commercial Treaty,  still in force, which specifically left Customs tariffs to be regulated solely by the internal legislation of the two States concerned and did not even embodsr a most favoured nation undertaking on either side as regards customs duties.      Nevertheless we do in fact enjoy and have continually enjoyed the advantage of the minimum tariff in France by virtue of a French Law, and it might be stated not unfairly that there is a tacit though not expressed agreement between the two countries to extend most favoured nation treatment to each other.12.    It is clear that for the most favoured nation clause to be of real value it must be drawn as tightly as possible and leave as little opening as possible for evasion.      A more general undertaking to treat our trade on the footing of the most favoured nation, although good enough in a temporary understanding is not sufficiently precise to secure all that we require.      It would be disastrous for instance if foreign countries were able to base differential duties on considerations such as the methods or conditions of manufacture, as it is frequently possible to indicate respects in which our manufacturing practice differs from those of our competitors.     The essential point in our view is the nature of the final oroduct itself, and the usualIs-
practice we have followed is to stipulate specifically that the duty applicable to our goods shall not exceed that applicable to like goods   of any other foreign origin.13.    Similar considerations apply as regards prohibitions of importation and we have always endeavoured to provide that no prohibitions shall be imposed on our goods which are not equally applicable to like goods of any other foreign origin.     There are, however, certain special conditions affecting prohibitions which will be dealt with below, but before doing so it would be well to refer briefly to the exceptions to full and complete most-favoured-nation treatment in regard to duties and prohibitions which, we have been ready to admit in particular cases in our Commercial Treaties. These fall under the heads of Customs Unions,  special geographical exceptions, Frontier Traffic, Sanitary and similar prohibitions and the treatment of bounty-fed goods.14.   The first is an exception to meet the possibility that during the currency of a Treaty the foreign country concerned might enter    into a full Customs Union with another. Prom the economic point of view the position is the same as would result from an extension of political frontiers and obviously we could not claim that because a customs barrier ceases to exist altogether whether as the result of political changes or of the formation of a Customs Union, our goods al-so should be admitted free of duty.      The only recently concluded Customs Union of any importance is that betweenBelgium and Luxemburg.15.    The second coneerns a few special cases in which owingto geographical contiguity or long historical association between two or more countries we have had to recognise the traditional practices by which special Customs favours aremutually accorded to each other by the foreign countries concerned.      For example we have thus recognised in our-9-
treaties with certain Central American republics that the special tariff arrangements made with other Central American republics fall outside the scope of the most-favoured-nation clause. Similar considerntions apoly in the case of our Treaties with the Baltic group of -States, and in our Treaties with Spain and Portugal which permit of special tariff concessions to each other, whilst the consideration of historical association explains the right we have recognised of Portugal to give.special favours to Brazil, of Denmark to give special favours to Sweden, and of Turkey to give special favours to territories which she lost under the Treaty of Lausanne.      In none of these cases is the derogation from full most-favoured-nation treat-ment a matter of any great moment to us, the actual extent of special preferences accorded under these arrangements being exceedingly limited, and the trade in question being largely concerned with merchandise of no great interest to this country. The fact that we have given recognition to arrangements of this character of minor importance of course in no way affects theattitude we should feel compelled to adopt to any largescheme,  such as has sometimes been suggested for the accord to eachother of special Customs preferences by groups of importantEuropean States.      The movement in Prance, for instance,towards the creation of a so-called &quot;United States of Europe&quot;,that is to say not a Customs Union but of a body of Statesgiving each other special Customs preferences as against therest of the world, is one which we should strenuously resistas cutting at the root of our most-favoured-nation policy,and not as being a minor derogation from it.16.    The concession in favour of frontier traffic is designed to meet the case of countries with land frontiers.It is a common practice for such countries to allow of thefree marketing of certain classes of goods such as agricultural produce over the frontier within a limited a one each side.-10-
This is designed of course solely in the interests of the... dwellers in these frontier districts and our Treaties accordingly include in many cases a stipulation that special facilities accorded in respect of frontier traffic within a limited zone (usually one of 15 kilometres) will not be claimed by us under our most-favoured-nation clause.17.        All these three classes of exceptions represent unimportant concessions on our part from the generality of the most-favoured-nation principle to meet the requirements offoreign countries. They give us no substantial rights in return inasmuch as we are not likely to conclude a customs union with any foreign country, as we do not give and do not desire to reserve the right to give special favours to any country with which we have close geographical or historical connection, and as we are not separated by a land frontier from any other foreign country.      It is to be observed in this connection that our right to give Imperial Preference is notsafeguarded by the insertion of any particular clause in our Treaties, but in the case of modern Treaties by the use of a particular form of words under which we claim and undertaketo give to the goods of countries with which we enter intoTreaty relations only the same treatment as is accorded tothose goods of any foreign country,, our right to give special treatment to Empire goods being thus tacitly recognised.    Theuse of this phraseology of course equally permits the countries with which we conclude treaties to accord preferences to their overseas possessions.      The other classes of exception referredto above, viz., those relating to sanitary and similarprohibitions and those relating to  &apos; bounty fed goods, stand ona different footing in that they are provisions adopted in our interests as well as that of the particular countries withwhich the Treaties are concluded.-11-
18.       As regards sanitary and similar prolxibitlcais-, -it&quot;^1b.. obvious that the exercise of the right to prohibit imports on these grounds is based on the conditions prevailing in the country from which the goods are derived, in other words, the very essence of the prohibition is that a distinction has to be drawn between goods like in themselves but produced under different conditions in different countries.    It is, therefore, not possible in this matter to give effect to the clause providing that no prohibition shall be imposed on goods from any country unless the like goods are prohibited from all other foreign countries, and prohibitions on these grounds have to be excepted specifically from the general operation of the clause.     A reservation to this effect accordingly appears in all recent commercial treaties.19.        So far as this memorandum has gone it will be seen that the object which has been consistently aimed at is to secure that with such relatively trifling exceptions as circum-stances may necessitate British goods shall not suffer in any foreign maMcet in competition with similar goods from any third country as a result of the tariff policy that the country in which the goods are marketed may pursue.    This object has to a large extent been achieved,.       Commercial arrangements, whether in the form of full and detailed commercial treatiea or in the form of briefer instruments (modus vivendi or exchange of notes) expressed in more general terms, are in force with every European country except Prance, where as already explained there is in fact a tacit understanding as regards duties and an actual treaty engagement as regards px^ohibitions.      They are similarly in force with   Turkey, Persia, Siam, China and Japan in Asia and with the United States and with some, though not all, of the countries of central and Southern America.    The treaty with the UnitedStates is not wholly satisfactory in this respect, as the-12-
United States Government have taken a less strict view of its implications than we do, and have occasionally in the past refused to extend to the United Kingdom certain minor special concessions which they accorded to other countries condition-ally on the grant of special favours in return.      Practically, however, the departures in the United States from the uniform treatment of goods of all foreign origin (except for the preference they hold themselves entitled to give to Cuba,, though Cuba is of course not under U.S.  sovereignty)  have been small in extent andin&amp;eod the cases in which throughout the world we fail to get full most favoured nation treatment for our goods are few and of little moment.20.    It follovjs, of course, in so far as this treatment depends on definite Treaty stipulationss and it does so depend in a large number of European countries which have Tariff systems admitting of the different treatment of goods of different origin, that we have had to give reciprocal under-takings and are ourselves precluded either from imposing different duties on goods of like kinds or on prohibiting goods without extending such prohibitions to goods of like kinds from all other foreign countries.      In particular we are, in general, precluded from distinguishing betY/een goods of the same kind,  in the matter of duties or prohibitions,  on the ground of conditions incident to their mode or conditions of manufacture such, for example, as their enjoyment of special s bate assistance or of bounties direct or indirect.21*    The words &quot;in general&quot; are used advisedly in the previous paragraph because in certain of our treaties the rights of both parties to accord special treatment to goods enjoying a direct or indirect bounty have been expressly reserved.      The history of these special reservations is bound up with out attitude to sugar bounties which as accorded by continental beet growing countries were threatening towards the end of last century to ruin our cane growing colonies
by flooding the market with artificially cheapened sugar.The expedient of meeting this competition so far as this market was concerned by applying counterveiling dutieswas considered so early as 1537, but the Law Officers who werconsulted advised that &apos;che proper interpretation of themost favoured nation clause in our treaties v/as that the term &quot;like articles51 referred to the quality,, nature anddescription of the articles and had no reference to theconditions of manufacture, and that it was impossible to,aargue that bounty fed sugar was not/like article with sugar not enjoying such advantages.      An international Convention was, hbwevers concluded in 1902 which obliged the parties to impose countorveiling duties on, or to prohibit the importation of,  sugar from foreign countries which a Permanent Commission, set up under the Convention, found to be giving bounties to the production on exportation of such sugar.      His h&apos;ajesty&apos;s Government took part in the Conference at which the Convention was drawn up and became parties thereto, and in pursuance of the international obligation did in fact prohibit the importation of sugar from one or two countries without regard to what had hitherto been considered to be their obligations under the most favoured nation clause of treaties with the particular countries concerned.22.    It was, &quot;however,  recognised Saai the action then taken even though it was action in pursuance of an international agreement5 was of a somewhat questionable character and it became the  .ractice from 1202 up to 1924 to secure the insertion in our treaties of a specific  clause excepting bounty fed. goods from the general most favoured nation provision.      In fact out treaties with the following countries, still in force, contain clauses excepting bounty
fed goods from most favoured nation treatment in the matter doth of duties ana of prohibitions: -Austria.       Czechoslovakia.       Estonia.Finland.       Guatemala. Honduras.1&apos;&apos; ,Lawiao Panama o Si am.Similar provisions auulying only to prohibitions hut not to duties are included in our trodties with Spain and Portugalp23.    A clause on these lines was proposed in tho first draft which was submitted to the Germans in connection with the negotiations for a treaty with them in 1924.      They refused, to accept the provision s which does not therefore appear in the Anglo-German Treaty,,24*    About this time,   the proposal to subsidise   home-grown beet sugar was adopted in this country, and it was felt desirable not to press thereafter for the special clause exempting bounty-fed articles from most-favoured-nation treatment,,      The consideration that such a clause might be turned against ourselves applies now not only to sugar but also to silk and possibly to coal.      There is in fact little doubt that the United Kingdom system of draw--- .       - . . ..... ........ . . :  ..&apos;;;&apos;     . ;    -.; - :&quot;-     :     .&apos;p&quot;: .    . -     P . &apos;.P &apos;    /     - -      .   &apos; - . . :   .&quot;baclcs on export operates as an export &quot;county on some descriptions at least of finished silk goods, whilst it is arguable that the derating scheme under which the reductions of local rates given to railways are used for reducing the cost of transport of e export coal is to some extent of the nature of the &quot;bounty.      Accordingly the provision excepting bounty-fed goods from the operation of the general most-f avoureoP-nation clause has been omitted from all treaties concluded since lt24 up to the recent Treaty with Turkey.
In tills case and in this case alone the provision has &quot;been reinstated, at the instance of the Turkish Government,,25.    The present position is,  therefore, that in the absence of a special clause dealing with the matter no country with which we have a treaty containing the most-favoured-nation clause in its usual form, unqualified by any special reservation such as that above referred to, would, in our view, be entitled to treat any particular description of goods that we export to them differentially, either in respect of import duties or in respect of import prohibitions on the ground of the existence of any alleged bounties or on any other ground based on the methods or Conditions of the manufacture of this description of goods.      It follows,  of course,  that e must equaily continue to regard ourselves as bound vis-a-vis the foreign countries concerned and that to this extent the clause restricts action which those who suffer from the importation of particular bounty-fed goods (e,g. German wheat and, oats)  have represented as desirable.      As regards this latter aspect of the matter, however, it should perhaps be pointeo out that to a great exporting country like our own the avoidance of any possible ground for discrimination is of outstanding importance,and that for this reason it is greatly to our interest to see that the widest and most unconditional interpretation is always placed on the most-favoured-nation clause,26o    Before passing from this branch of the subject it may be well to refer to the special case of goods
dumped by a particular exporter or group of exporterson a foreign market such as our ovm.     The Law Officers were consulted in connection with Part II of the Safeguarding ofIndustries Act,      This part of the Act, which is now no longer in force9 provided &quot;both for safeguarding and anti-dumping duties.      They held that the Treaty clauses, which provide thatthe duty on goods &quot;tie produce or manufacture of a particular country must not exceed that on like articles the produceor manufacture of any foreign country, preclude the impositionof a special duty on all the goods of a particular class or description from a particular foreign country, on theground of general conditions such as exchange conditions prevailing in that country.     On the other hand,  they advised that these Treaty Clauses did not preclude the imposition of aspecial anti-dumping duty on the particular goods which whenproduced in such a country are sold here at prices below thecost of production,  the reason being that the duty is notimposed on the goods of the country concerned as such, but onlyhereon such goods as are sold/on.Yspecial conditions and that it can in fact be avoided by any exporter who does not resort to dumping methods.      It is, of course, by no means certain that other countries would accept this particular line of argument, but it is mentioned here as being of some interest, though in fact no anti-dumping duty was ever applied in this country under the Act to any class of imported goods.      The existing prohibition in this country of prison-made goods could possibly be defended on somewhat similar lines, he,,  that it does not involve the prohibition of all the goods of any particular class or description from any foreign country, and that the question of difference of treatment between like goods from different countries does not, therefore, arise0PART II.    PROHIBITIONS OF IMPORTATION AND EXPORTATION.27.    Prohibitions, especially Prohibitions of importation, raise problems special to themselves,,    So long as prohibitions
were absolute in character, as they were generally in pre-war days, the ordinary form of most-favoured-nation clao.se adequately safeguarded British interests.    As explained above,   the most-favoured-nation principle is not applicable at least in its full unconditional form to prohibitions imposed for sanitary reasons,  though even in this case it is possible to provide (and a provision in the sense is to be found in the Anglo-German treaty)  that prohibitions of this character shall only be enforced in regard to a particular country if they are enforced in regard to other countries whore similar conditions prevail.    The object of such a stipulation is, however,  to secure that a prohibition is imposed bona fide for sanitary reasons rather than to eliminate the discrimination which is to some extent inherent in prohibitions of this nature.    The same is true of prohibitions of the importation of goods from a country in which they enjoy a bounty, where such prohibitions are permitted under the provisions of any particular treaty. As regards other1 absolute prohibitions, however, unconditional most-favoured-nation treatment can obviously be given and is accordingly stipulated for in our treatieso88.    During the war, an entirely different class of prohibition grew up, viz.,  a prohibition qualified by licence aimed not at preventing but at controlling the trade in a particular article.    For many reasons the necessity of restricting importation under war conditions was so vital that many countries, including the United Kingdom, felt it necessary to do this by direct methods, and, instead of adopting the old but indirect expedient of a Customs tariff, directly limited quantities of particular goods imported by prohibiting their importation and issuing licences for limited quantities.    In the United Kingdom the primary object of our import prohibitions was to economise tonnage
and to secure that the available tonnage space should beused for the importation of foodstuffs and raw materials,instead of being frittered away in the importation ofgoods of less necessity to our national economy, and mostof these prohibitions were swept away with the terminationof the war.&apos;    Unfortunately, other European countriesfaced with continuing exchange difficulties maintained and even developed the practice,  so that in the earlypost-war years trade was hampered not merely by highCustoms duties, but by an excessive number of prohibitions,mitigated by licences.20o    Now this method of restricting imports&apos; was open to two classes of objection from the point of view of anexporting country such as ourselves.    In the first place it made the most-favoured-nation clause almostmeaninglessj because it is almost impossible &quot;to lay downgeneral principles as to the quantities of any particulararticle which we could reasonably claim should beallowed to be imported from the United Kingdom in relationto the quantities allowed to be imported from any other country, and we could only claim a generally equitabletreatment in this respect.    On the one hand it would obviously not be equitable that, because only a certainquantity of cotton goods were allowed to be imported into some specified country from,  say, France, we should onlybe allowed to send the same quantity having regard, to thefact that in normal circumstances we should have sentmuch larger quantities; on the other hand we could hardlyclaim the right to send such goods as silks in equalquantities with the great silk exporting countries.50.    But quite apart from the inherent difficulties of determining what constituted equitable treatment for our trade the whole system of prohibition and licence was onecalculated to impose on our trade the greatest of all-19-
obstacles, viz., the obstacle of uncertainty.    With a known customs tariff it is always possible for the trader to look ahead with at least some measure of certainty and make plane accordingly.    Provided that duties remain substantially unaltered tho obstacles to be encountered are known, and traders have an assurance that on paying their duties they can market their goods.    The system of licence is one in regard to which there can be no certainty,  for the extent to which licences will be issued and the conditions on which they will be issued can never be exactly forecast and can be and are constantly varied.    Further,  the system almost inevitably entails greater delays in procedure, applications for licences being held up often for long periods,  and it also unfortunately lends itself much more than do customs tariffs to corruption and to the adoption by those uin the know&quot; of improper methodsof securing early and favourable consideration of applications for licences.    Ail honest traders have accordingly always agreed that even a high tariff barrier is far less of an impediment to trade development than that constituted by a prohibition system and it has been the constant aim of our policy to do all in our power to induce foreign countries to bring it to an end.31*    When treaty negotiations were first undertaken with Germany there were still a large number of these objectionable prohibitions in force in that country and it is in the Treaty with that country that the first serious effort was made to embody in a diplomatic instrument an agreement for the limitation of prohibitions.    By this Treaty and the Protocol thereto, which are still in force, both sides undertook that apart from a limited number of prohibitions v-.hich were notified by each side to the other no prohibitions (of importation or exportation) should be imposed or maintained by either on the trade with each other which did not fall.within one or other of the following unobjectionable categories-80-
(a) Public Safety;(b) Sanitary grounds or for protection of animals and plants against diseases and pests;(c) In respect of weapons, ammunition and war material and, under exceptional circumstances,  also in respect of other materials needed, in war;(d) For the purpose of prohibiting the importation of articles where such prohibition is imposed under the Patent Laws of the respective parties;(e) For the purpose of extending to foreign goods prohibitions and restrictions which are or may hereafter be imposed by internal legislation upon the production, sale, consumption or providing within the territories of the party concerned of goods of the same kind produced within these territories,  including,  in particular, goods which are the subject of s State monopoly or similar arrangement.32.      It was agreed that these provisions did not preclude the making of reasonable regulations as to the manner,  form or place of importation or the marketing of imported goodls, or the enforcement of these regulations by the prohibition of the importation of goods which did not comply with them.33.    The only other country with which a similar bilateral agreement has been concluded is Persia, and in that case theTreaty though provisionally in force has not yet been formallyratified.    It is, however, to be observed that as the result ofthe operation of the ordinary most-favoured-nation clause we arein fact bound not to impose against most other countries with whichwe have Treaties any prohibitions which we do not impose againstGermany i.e.  any new prohibitions other than those of the categoriesabove set out.    On the other hand other countries were not boundtowards us by any reciprocal obligation so that the position wasto a large extent one sided.    It was for this reason, amongst others,that we took an active part in promoting the conclusion of an
international arrangement which would extend to other countries obligations sirailar to those which Germany had undertaken in  the Anglo-German Treaty of 19 24.34.    It is true that in the period following the conclusion of  this latter Treaty the objectionable system of prohibition and licence had to a large extent disappeared from Europe.    Traces of it still remained,  indeed, notably in Poland and Czechoslovakia,  though we had been able to come to arrangements of an informal character with both countries which secure  the importation of fair quantities of our goods.    The international agreement at which we arrived, however, was rather of the nature of an insurance against the revival of the system than an attempt to get rid of these remaining traces, and the actual agreement itself -would in fact not have been possible if it had not included provisions for exceptions in favour of the various participants who were each permitted   to retain some few-prohibitions in force not justified by the general provisions of the agreement.    It is worth noting in this connection that we ourselves were in this position as we had to reserve specially our right to maintain the existing prohibition of dye stuffs and intermediates.35.    Apart from these special provisions, and apartalso from certain general provisions relating to suchmatters as prohibitions for the safeguarding of therevenue and -prohibitions of prison made goods, theinternational Convention limits prohibitions of importationand exportation to the following classes:-1.  Prohibitions or Restrictions relating to public security.2. Prohibitions or Restrictions imposed on moral or humanitarian grounds.
3.    Prohibitions or Restrictions regarding traffic in anus, ammunition or implements of war or, in exceptional circumstances, all o-ther TiilJLtarv supplies,4.    Prohibitions or Restrictions imposed for theprotection of public health or for the protection of animals or plants against disease, insects and harmful parasites-5.    Export Prohibitions or Restrictions issued for the protection of national trades of artistic, historic or archaeological value.6.    Prohibitions or Restrictions applicable to gold, silver, coins, currency notes, banknotes or securi ties.7.    Prohibitions or Restrictions designed to extend to foreign products the regime established within the country In respect of the production of trade in and transport and consumption of native products of the same kind.8.    Prohibitions or Restrictions applied to products which as regards production or trade can or may in future be subject within the country to State monopoly or t o  monopolies exercised under State control.Tills list of exceptional prohibitions will be seen to be somewhat wider than that in the Anglo-German Treaty but It follows much the same linss.-36.    It is clear that under neither instrument are we, as parties thereto, in a position to impose prohibitions for certain other purposes which have sometimes teen held to justify prohibition.3, e.gM the fact that goods are manufactured under unfair conditions of labour or that they are the subject of a bounty direct or indirect.    Any steps to secure liberty of action in such directions could only be undertaken a s a result of fresh international unders tan ding s.37.    The arrangement originally arrived at for bringing this International Convention into force was that it should only become operative if 18 countries agreed .$0 ratify it before September 30th, 1929,    In fact the full number of ratifications was not secured by that date, but as the result of a further conference a special protocol was signed between 17 countries bringing it temporarily into force as from January let, 1930-
30.    Owing, however,   to the failure of pole rid and Czechoslovakia, to adhere to it, most of the  signatories have since ceased to be bound by it and at present it only binds six countries besides ourselves,  viz: Denmark, Holland,  Japan, Norway, Portugal and the United States of America.    Any of the countries can withdraw on June 30th in 1931,  1932,  1953 or 1934. PART III.     INTERNAL:DUTIES OF GOODS.39c    A third class of provision in Commercial Treaties which in recent years has been found to be an obstacle to action advocated by our agricultural interests still remains to be explained,  viz? those clauses in our Commercial Treaties which guarantee to foreign products national treatment in regard to internal duties.40.    The wording of the clauses is different in differentTreaties, but the form now generally put forward in our draftproposals for new Commercial Treaties is as follows:-&quot;Internal duties levied within the t erritories of either of the High Contracting Parties for  the benefit of the State or local authorities or corporations in goods the produce or manufacture of the territories of the other Party shall not be other or greater than the duties levied in similar circumstances on the like goods of national origin,  provided that in no case shall such duties be more burdensome than the duties levied in similar circumstances on the like goods of any other foreign country.&quot;41.    The main object of such a clause is of course to limit to the actual Customs Tariff the protection afforded to national goods seeing that this Customs Tariff represents aknown and clearly defined obstacle to the goods concerned,whereas if our goods were liable to be submitted to furtherdifferential treatment in the interior and to treatment whichmight well vary from locality to locality traders would be ina state of much greater uncertainty as to the actual obstacles to be encountered in disposing of their goods.    Putting thematter broadly,   indirect methods of protection are likely toimpose greater obstacles to trade than direct methods because
of the greater measure of uncertainty that they involve.42.    A clause on these lines is of course of even greater moment,   and is indeed positively necessary,  in those relatively few cases In which our Treaties prescribe the actual maximum rates to he levied on specified classes of British goods,  as in such cases it is evident that the whole object of limiting Customs duties would be defeated were it possible for the foreign country concerned to load the goods in question with differential internal duties after they had acquitted the Customs duties prescribed in the Treaty.43.    At present clauses of one form or another securing national treatment in the matter of internal duties are to be found in our Treaties with the following countries:-44.    Of these Treaties,  those with Greece,  Siam and Yugo-slavia contain provisions limiting the Customs duties on certain commodities, whilst the Treaties with Japan and Spain originally did so though the Tariff provisions of these Treaties are no longer operative *.45.    It is of course obvious that in order to secure these clauses we have had to enter Into reciprocal obligations, and as there are other countries  than those above named which could claim most-favoured-nation treatment in regard to internal duties we are in fact debarred from discriminating In regard to excise- duties between imported and home produce.    Any protection we desire to give, to the latter must be afforded through the medium of the Customs Tariff.46o    It is these clauses which it has been necessary to cite from time to time when schemes have been put forwardAustria GreeceEstonia HungaryFinland Japan.France (including LatviaGermanyAlgeria)PortugalRoumaniaSiamSpainTurkeyYougoslavia.
forgiving preferential treatment to British &quot;barley in connection with the excise duty on &quot;beer.Conclusion.47.    The general object of this memorandum has been to indicate the advantages we have secured in regard to the treatment of our goods by foreign countries by means of commercial treaties and other similar arrangements.   Whilst little attention is often given to the objects of our commercial policy in these respects, public opinion is generally too apt to fasten on the other side of the picture, i.e.  on the extent to which we have tied our hands by these commitments.    The public frequently learn with impatience that,  as a result of our  treaty commitments, we are not in a position to carry out schemes which offer prima facie advantages to British interests in the United Kingdom, but they seldom stop to think how great would be the risk to our export trade on which we depend were we not assured by these very treaties against action on the part of other countries which might well ruin it.

(THIS DOCULIBHT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S BOV3RNI,1EITTo)SECRET. TaB.C^(5i.)  8,CAB I N E ,T, TRADE SURVEY G01/5,-11TTEE .ANT I-DuLIPING. LEGISLATION. Note by the President of the Board of Trade.1.    I circulate herewith, for the information of mycolleagues, a memorandum giving an account (Section I)  of the origin and operation of the anti-dumping provisions of Part ii of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921, and an account(Section III)  of anti-dumping provisions which have been enacted in certain other countries,,      The memorandum also sets out (Section Ii)  certain statements which have recently beenmade as to alleged dumping of particular classes of goods at prices below either the cost of production or the selling price in the country of origin,.2,    The term &quot;Dumping&quot; is employed in a variety of senses.It is frequently used loosely to mean the sale of imported goods at prices substantially below those at which homoproduced goods can profitably be sold,  the inference beingthatthe difference in price Is due to some&quot;unfair&quot; condition in the foreign country, such as a lower standard of wages or conditions of labour, or - in the circumstances which prevailedfor some years after the end of the war - depreciating exchanges.Used with more precision, however, the term &quot;dumping&apos;;is usually employed to mean the sale of goods on importationat prices which are below either the cost of production orthe selling price in the country of origin - with theaddition in either case of cost of transport, etc.      Thelegislation described in the memorandum is directed against&quot;dumping&quot; in this more precise sense,- 1 -
3.    It is noteworthy that anti-dumping legislation is &quot;by no means general,  and the application of such legislation as exists is still less general,,     It appears from Section III of the Memorandum that specific anti-dumping provisions exist in the tariff laws of five of the British Dominions and in only six foreign countries, and that effect has &quot;been given to those provisions in only four British Dominions and one foreign country - the United States of ADericae4.    As regards the Treaty obligations of this country in the matter I would call attention to the fact that when the Safeguarding of Industries Act was in course of preparation in 1921 the then Law Officers advised that Treaty clauses providing for the accord of most-favoured-nation treatment did not preclude the imposition of a special anti-dumping dutjr on particular goods sold here at prices below the cost of production      It would,  of course, be necessary that any anti-dumping measures that it might be decided to take should extend equally to dumped goods from all foreign countries If, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government should decide in favour of the adoption of any such measures, it would clearly be desirable that the Law Officers should again be consulted as to the compatibility of the particular measures contemplated with the existing Treaty obligations of this country05C    The levying of anti-dumping duties involves the ascertainment of precise information concerning costs of production or- prices in other countriesc     Such information is necessary in the first instance in order to decide upon what classes of goods and from what countries duty shall be leviedo     Moreover, if the amount of the duty is to be such as exactly to countervail the discrepancy between costs oi prices in the country of origin and prices in the country&apos; of import, similar information is also necessary in respect of each shipmento
It is significant that all those countries, via., a number of British Dominions and the United States,of America which have enforced anti-dumping duties, are countries in which there is an import t:.riff under which duty is levied upon imports generally on the basis of their market value in the country of origin.      These countries, for the general purposes of tariff administration, have established machinery for ascertaining and checking such market values, which can of course be used in the administration of anti-dumping provisions.     The provisions of the Safeguarding of Industries Act in this country relating to imported goods sold here below the wholesale price in the country of origin, were rendered entirely nugatory owing mainly to the extreme difficulty which complainant industriGS in this country found in establishing what was the wholesale price in the country of origin of the goods with which they were concerned.60    These facts show that any scheme for levying anti-dumping duties, in order to be effective, must providefor placing upon the importer the onus of producing evidence as to the selling prices of the goods in the country of origin, and for setting up some machinery whereby the statements so adduced can be checked.     At present in this country the declared value of goods on importation is,  in effect, the value at which they are invoiced to the importer and our ad valorem duties are assessed on that value.    In other words, there is at present no official information as to the selling prices in the country of manufacture of the goods we import, and there is no obligation on the importer to acquaint himself with such prices.      It would seem difficult to flefend requiring importers of all goods, or of particular classes of
goods,to secure the necessary particulars in respect of their importations in order to enable anti-dumping duties to he levied on some classes of goods,  or some consignments of goods within a particular class, unless that requirement were part of the machinery of a general tariff based on valuation by roference to s elling price in the country of origin.Board of Trade 36th July, 1931.
memorandum; i.Anti-dumping 1 egislation in this country.1. For a number of years after the war legislation was in force providing for the imposition of anti-dumping duties upon imported goods sold in this country at prices substantially below the wholesale prices in the country of origin.      In fact no such duty was ever imposed. Provision was also made for the imposition of similar duties on goods which owing to exchange depreciation were sold below the price of profitable manufacture in this country.      Such duties were imposed in a number of instances. 2. The final Report of the Committee on Commercial andIndustrial Policy after the War which was published in December 1917s in dealing with the question of dumping (by which was understood the sale of goods in a particular market at prices lower than those at which the goods are currently offered in the country of manufacture)  contained the following recoramendation:-i!The producers of this country are entitled to require from the Government that they should be protected in their home market against  &apos;dumping&apos;  as previously defined.&apos;&apos;ife recommend that action be taken in regard to T dumping&apos; on the lines  (though not necessarily in the precise form)  adopted in Canada. -In 1918 the Minister of Reconstruction asked hisAdvisory Council -&quot;To consider the rec  leisn&amp;ations of Lord Balfour of 3r.rleigh&apos;s Committee upon Commercial and Industrial Policy that legislative action should be taken &quot;l.n the United. Kingdom for the prevention of ^dumping&apos;,, and to advise as to the precise character of such legislation.      By &apos;dumping&apos;  is understood the sale of goods in the markets of the United Kingdom at prices lower than those at which the goodu are currently offered in the country  of manufacture&quot;&apos;.The Council produced a report ^ivin^, an outline of antidumping legislation and machinery. which outline was followed
with certain alterations in Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921.3. Part II of this Act contained two provisions -(a) for the imposition of a customs duty on goods sold in the United Kingdom at prices below the &quot;cost of production&apos;&apos; as defined;    and(b) for the imposition of a customs duty on goods sold in the United Kingdom at prices which by reason of the depreciation of the currency of the country of origin were below the price at which similar goods could be profitably manufactured in the United Kingdom.4. It was laid down in the Act that if on complaints madeto them it appeared to the Board of Trade that ^oods of any kind (except articles of food or drink) manufactured in a country outside the United Kingdom were being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices below the cost ofproduction (or by reason of currency depreciation below theprice of profitable manufacture in this country),  and that employment in this country was being or was likely to be seriously affected thereby, the Board might refer the matter to a committee for enquiry.&quot;Cost of production&apos;1 was    defined in the .-.ct as &quot;&quot;thecurrent sterling equivalent of 95 per cent of(a) the wholesale price at the works charged for goods of the class or description for consumption in the country of manuf acture........or(b) If no such goods are sold wholesale for consumption in the country of manufacture the price at the works....... which would have beenreasonable if the goods had been so sold, and in determining what price would have been reasonable regard shall be had to the wholesale prices charged for goods as near as may be similar&quot;*If the Committee reported that the conditions above-mentioned were fulfilled the Board of Trade might make an &apos; Order in respect of such goods manufactured in the country in question.      They then, under Section 3 of the Act, became liable to a customs duty of 33 l/3 per cent,  ad valorem;, subject to the remission of the duty in the case of any particular consignments which it was proved were sold at a
price not less than the cost of production.      The Order was subject to approval hy Resolution of the House of Commons.No order might9 however, he made which was at variance with treaty obligations.5. Duties on account of dumping arising from exchange depreciation were imposed on the following articles of German   origin:Fabric gloves, glove fabric, domestic and illumina-ting glasswares domestic hollow-ware of aluminium or of enamelled wrought iron or steel, and gas mantles.The exchange depreciation provisions were enacted for a limited period only and expired in August 1924.6. There were very few applications for enquiry in respect of dumping below ,!cost of production&apos;&apos; - in all only nine, and of those only two reached the stage of being referred to committees for enquiry.      These two were in respect of glass bottles manufactured in Holland and vulcanised fibre manufactured in the United States of America.      In their reports dated August, 1922, and October, 1922, respectively, the Committees stated that they did not consider that the applicants had proved that the goods in question were being sold, in this country below the cost of production. Applications were also received in respect of thrown silk from Italy,     -microscopes from the United States of America, rubber tyres from the United states of America (all prior to December 1922) , split wood pulleys from Germany (August 1925), chrome upper leather from France (April 1927) , gallic acid from Germany (May 1927) vegetable parchment from Germany, Belgium, France, and Italy (March 1928).      These applications were either rejected by the Board of Trade on the ground that a prima-facie case had not been established, or not proceeded with.      In addition an enquiry was received in July, 1929, from the British Electrical and Allied
Manufacturers&apos;.&apos; Association, representing manufacturers cf electricity meters, whether the Board were prepared to entertain further applications.      The enquirers were informed that it had been decided to take the first opportunity of repealing the powers of the Board, and further it was announced in November, 1929, in the House of Commons that applications would not be entertained aricj. that it would be directly opposed to the declared policy of the Government to maintain the powers in force.      Accordingly the Section conferring the power to impose a duty was repealed in the Finance Act, 1930.      There is thus no anti-dumping legislation in force in the United Kingdom at present.It will be observed that in nine years no anti-dumping duty of the kind in question was ever&apos;    imposed. Experience indicates that British manufacturers have had the greatest difficulty in securing the necessary evidence concerning the cost of production or wholesale price of goods in the country of origin.7.  Question also arose whether the imposition of an anti-dumping duty would not be in conflict pith Treaty obligations.      The Lav/ Officers of the Grown advised that the Treaty clauses, which provide that the duty on goods the produce cf manufacture of a particular country, must not exceed that on like articles the produce or manufacture of any other foreign country, did not preclude the imposition of a special anti-dumping duty on particular goods sold here at prices below the cost of production.    Their opinion was based, upon the ground that the duty would not be imposed on the goods of the country concerned as such but only on such goods as might have been sold here on special conditions and that the duty could in fact have been avoided by any exporter who did not resort to dumping methods.      It is of course by no means certain that this argument would have been accepted by
countries with which we have Treaties providing for most-favoured-nation treatment, and it would almost certainly have been objected to by France, with which country there is only a tacit understanding that most-favoured-nation treatment   will be granted,      On the other hand, as regards duties imposed on all the goods of a particular class from a particular foreign country, on the ground of depreciated exchange, the Law Officers  Advised that the Treaty clauses in question did not allow of the imposition of such duties. As the time when such duties were imposed upon certain goods from Germany, however, there was no treaty granting most-favoured-nation treatment to that country.II.ALLEGED INSTANCES OF DUMPING. The following particulars relating to various cases of alleged dumping have come to the notice of the Board of Trade.Iron and Steel.The National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers in November last furnished a comparison of home and export prices of certain classes of steel in Great Britain and Belgium, France and Germany.      The figures indicated that while the export prices of certain British steel were slightly below the prices in the home market, Continental steel was sold for export at prices very substantially below home prices.The National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers also furnished in the early part of this year information showing that United States steel wire was offered in February, o.hf. Glasgow, at prices much below the prices of the same wire at Pittsburgh.The Federation also reported in 1 larch 1931 that wire rods were quoted f.o.b. Antwerp at  5.12. 6 per ton, whereas bright wire drawn from the rods was only  5.0.0d.
per ton, and wire nails made from the wire  5.1.01. per ton, Blastic v/ebbing.The Board of Trade have recently been informed that the American elastic webbing manufacturers have agreed to send over to England all their surplus stock and throw-outs of elastic webbings in order not to disturb the /jnerican home market.      It has been stated that the prices realised are below both the American and the British cost of production,, Felt hat Bodies.The British Pelt Eat manufacturers&apos; Federation in December 1950 represented to the Board of Trade that for some time past it has been a very common occurrence for Foreign hoods for felt hats to be placed for sale in this country at prices at which British manufacturers could not even buy the wool.    They stated also that the foreign manufacturers could not buy the wool more cheaply than the British manuf a c t ur er s.As regards allegations of dumping of goods from Russia5 in the great majority of cases there is no information available either as to selling prices in Russia or as to costs of production.      A memorandum on imports from Russia has already been circulated to the Trade Survey Committee.An example of the sale for export by British manufacturers at prices lower than those charged by them in the home market is Sulphate of Ammonia.     Nearly all the British manufacturers of Sulphate of Ammonia are combined in the Sulphate of iumnonia Federation which arranges the sale of the product at home and abroad and divides up the proceeds (less administrative expenses)  equally among the producers in proportion to their sales.      Sulphate of Ammonia is sold to the British farmer carriage paid at a fixed price wherever he may be, the price in the Spring of the present year being  9.10.0d. for 6 ton lots.      The bulk (nearly :f in 1929)  of the output, however, is exported, being sold at a lower price, the average declared
value f.o.b. of the sulphate of ammonia exported in the first five months of this year Toeing only a trifle over 07 per ton.      This value no doubt includes a smaller cost of carriage;; and may relate on the average to much larger parcels, than the home price.,  ,111.AFTI-DUMPII7G PROVISIOnS  TIT THE BRITISH EmPIRE.  LTD FOREIGN CCUIITRIiLS.(l) Existing anti-dumping -provisions.      Specific anti-dumping provisions exist in the Customs and cognate legislation of five of the British Dominions (Australia, Hew Zealand, Canada, Union of South Africa and Newfoundland and some six foreign countries (United States, Japan, Turkey, Poland, Portugal and Cuba).      Particulars of  these provisions are given in Appendix I attached to this note. In various other foreign countries the Government possess more or less general powers to protect native industry, which might in conceivable circumstances be used to combat dumping.For the purposes of this Note only the ordinary form of dumping is taken into consideration, i.e. , the selling of goods for export at prices unduly low compared with home prices.      There are other forms of dumping duties in some of the Dominions (e.g. , :,freight&apos;r dumping duty) which it seems unnecessary to take into consideration.(2) Anti-dumping provisions in practice. - Although as indicated above, 11 countries have specfic    anti-dumping provisions, action against dumping has, so-far as our records show, only been taken in four Dominions (Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa) and in one foreign country (United States).      Reports have come in from Japan,, on occasions, that the Government was considering action
under the anti-dumping provisions  (e.g. , in 1930 as regards soda ash and sulphate of ammonia), hut nothing has resulted.The following five paragraphs  (3 to 7)  give a summary outline of the principal provisions of the legislation on the matter in those countries where anti-dumping provisions are or have been brought into operation (i.e., the four large Dominions and the United States).(3)  Ant i-dumping; -provisions in Australia.    -    In briefest outline, the Australian provisions are as follows:-(a) &quot;Ordinary&quot;&apos;1 dumping duty is imposed if goods are sold to Australia at an export price less than a figure built up from the fair market value at the time of shipment.(b) &quot;Dumping below cost;i duty is imposed if goods are sold to ,-australia at an export price less than a Reasonable&quot;&apos; price - the &quot;reasonable&quot;&apos; price being built up from the cost of production (which, in the absence of satisfactory information, can be fixed arbitrarily).(c) Diimping duty is levied on goods cons fan ed for sale to Australia if they may be sold at less than a &quot;reasonable&quot; price.      The &quot;reasonable&quot; price is built up from the fair market value    or, if evidence of such value is insufficient, from the costs of production, or, if such costs are not ascertainable, from, the costs of production estimated from such information as is available.(4) Anti-dumpinp provisions in hew Zealand.  - Under hew Zealand legislation dumping duty may be levied if the actual selling price to hew Zealand is less than the current domestic value or than a price based on cost of production. If dumping is suspected in the case of goods consigned to
New Zealand the authorities may &quot;determine the actual selling price, or the cost of production, or the current domestic value&apos;&apos;a( 5) Antl-^^ingjgroVi sj..ph.snr in Csjiada*     Ordinary dumping duty is payable if the export or actual selling price to an importer in Canada is less than the fair market value or the value for Customs duty.,    If dumping is suspected in the case of goods on consignment, the authorities are empowered to take such action as is necessary to ensure payment thereofj      (in some half dozen cases, such action has been taken in the form of requiring a deposit of 15;C ad valorem -the maximum, amount of dumping duty then leviable - it being left to importers to claim refunds on production of proof that the prices actually realised did not justify the application of dumping duty).Under 1930 legislation special provision was made for dumping duty on goods sold by manufacturers to subsidiaries in Canada below the duty-paid value plus various costs.(6) Anti-dumping provisions in South Africa.^ -&quot;Ordinary&quot; dumping duty is leviable when export price is less than the domestic value plus various costs.    ,fSales&apos;&apos; dumping duty is leviable where goods are sold or offered for sale at a port in the Union at an amount less than the domestic value plus certain costs and duties.    No special provision to meet the case of goods on consignment can be traced?(7) United States ant 1-damping.1 provisions.  - Anti-dumping duties are leviable if the purchase price or exporters&apos;  sales price is less than the foreign market value or, in the absence thereof, the cost of production. As regards goods on consignment it may be noted (l)  that
the Consular invoice for such goods (if dutiable ad valorem must give the price which the seller would have received, or is willing to receive;  for sales in the country of export, and (2) that if dumping is suspected, appraisers may require affidavits promising that a sworn statement of detailed prices as actually received will in due course be furnished.(8)*    Provisions common to all anti-dumping provisions. It will he observed that in all five countries where anti-dumping provisions have been brought into practical operation the liability tc dumping duty is determined by a comparison of actual prices with an amount which either is the home consumption value cr the dutiable value or is built up with reference to such values.      In all five countries the Customs duties are mainly,  cr very largely, ad valorem,  and under ordinary Customs legislation and procedure - quite apart from anti-dumping - there is machinery for obtaining and to some extent checking particulars of home consumption values or other bases for dutiable value.      The American Consular invoice system and the system of exporters&apos;  declarations to the Dominions, tmmen in conjunction with the activities of the American and Dominion representatives in exporting countries,  and of appraisers in the countries of import, designed to secure full information as to fair marmot values in the country of export  (and in some countries even cost of production), must obviously facilitate action under anti-dumping provisions.        It might accordingly perhaps be said that the administration of the anti-dumping provisions is merely an extension of the general Customs and valuation practioe cf the countries in question.      Liability to dumping duty in the five countries can be more or less
readily ascertained because  of the availability of information as to the costs of goods in the countries of export,  owing to the existence of machinery for obtaining such or similar information under the ordinary Customs pract ice.(9)    Determination and notification as to liability to dumping duty.    -    In Canada the application of dumping duties is net dependent upon the publication of notifications specifying particular classes of goods as liable to the duty.        The duty is levied by the Customs, in cases where consignments of goods of any description, provided they are of a class or hind manufactured in Canada, are liable thereto in accordance with the legislative provisions, on the basis cf the details set out in the invoices,  which are required to show separately the actual sale price to the Canadian Importer and the fair market value for home consumption in the country of export.    In Australia and South Africa enquiry and report has to he made by a Government btdy, and a notice or proclamation has to be issued specifying the goods to which a liability to dumping duty attaches.      In hew Zealand,,  under the rules issued under the anti-dumping provisions,  it is stated that the  intention to impose a dumping duty must  (except in special circumstances) be notified 5 months in advance.      In the United States, an anti ^-dumping &quot;finding1&quot;,  specifying the liability of certain goods,  is issued by the Treasury Department after such enquiry as they consider necessary;      but appraisers suspecting dumping (before any finding is issued) may withhold the appraisement  report.(10)    Extent of present anti-dumping duties.  - No information can be traced as to the extent to which dumping-duties authorised under the legislation of the five countries in question are at present applied,  in practice, i.e., no particulars can he obtained of the Customs revenue
from such duties.      As indicated in the preceding paragraph the liability of goods to dumping duty is,  in Canada? not notified.      In New Zealand the only cases of dumping duty notifications now current are those issued in respect of pig iron from India (1927) and jam from South Africa (1930). As regards Australia. a list of goods &quot;gazetted&quot; under the provisions quoted in Appendix 1 is given In Appendix 2 -there are some 41 classes of goods (from various countries) affected.      In South Africa some 7 classes of goods are at present liable to dumping duty (see Appendix 2);    and in the United States some 23 classes of goods have been the subject&apos;of ant i--dumping &quot;findings&quot; which have (so far as our information goes) not been revoked (see Appendix 2). It does not necessarily follow from the fact that goods are notified as liable to dumping duty that a dumping duty is in fact levied on goods which are the subject of the notification:    the duty is, of course, only liable to be imposed if the price conditions of a particular consignment so warrants.It will be observed from the Statements in Appendix 2 that in a number of cases the notifications only apply to goods of the particular class or description if imported from specified countries including the United Kingdom.
