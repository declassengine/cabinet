FHIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANHIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT ICOPY HO.      t)CABINET.LOCAL GOVERNMENT (CLERKS) BILL. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OE HEALTH.The Local Government (Clerks) Bill which has passed through the Lords received an unopposed Second Reading in the Commons on the call-over on Wednesday, July 8th, and now stands referred to Standing Committee A.      It is at the bottom of a long list of Bills and has no ohance of reaching the Statute Book unless it is taken over by the Government.    I feel justified in asking that this should be done because I think it would enable me to secure the passage into law of this useful measure without taking up any time on the floor of the House. The Bill does not involve any grant from the Exchequer.    If the Bill is starred, it can be referred to Standing Committee D as soon as the Town and Country Planning Bill is through Committee, and I expect to finish the Committee stage of the Planning Bill on Tuesday, July 14th.      I should hope to obtain the Committee Stage of the Local Government (Clerks) Bill in one sitting as there are unlikely to be any amendments of substance. The remaining stages of the Bill could probably be obtained on the call-over without debate.I hope my colleagues will agree that the Bill should now be starred and be referred to Standing Committee D as soon as the Town and Country Planning Bill is disposed of.The Bill is agreed with the County Councils1 Association and its primary object (the separation of the office of Clerk of the County Council from that of Clerk of the Peace) is necessary to meet present day conditions and is highly desired by members of our Party engaged in the work of County Councils.July 10th, 1931. (Intld.)    A.G.SECRET. OP 172(31).
