Memorandum by the President of the Board,, of.Trade,.For some years past serious complaints have &quot;been made to the Board of Trade by the shipowners regarding the discrimination practised by the Portuguese Government against British and other non-Portuguese ships, and the shipowners are now supported by the Federation of British Industries and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce.     The discrimination has taken two forms? (l) the charging of higher maritime and port dues at Portuguese ports on foreign than on Portuguese vessels, and (2) the allowance of a rebate of customs import and export duties in respect of goods carried in Portuguese vessels.     The latter form of discrimination has been in existence since 1921.As the result of repeated representations the Portuguese Government in January last issued a decree abolishing the first form of flag discrimination,* but the second form, which is much the more serious, remains.     Under it all goods shipped to and from Portugal in Portuguese vessels receive a rebate of 10 per cent, of the duties (in the case of some export duties it is as high as 20 per cent.).     As certain of the Portuguese duties are exceedingly high, a 10 per cent, rebate in import duty is a most important consideration to the importer.     Its amount varies with the class of goods carried, but it is equivalent to 22 per cent, of the freight in the case of coal, 50 per cent, in the case of wheat, and 95 per cent, in the case of rice.     In the case of higher class goods it may be as much as twice the value of the freight, and even twenty and thirty times as much.* though no information has yet been received of the issue of the regulations to give effect to this, which it was proposed to issue before the end of June.
0 P. o U 0Portugal&apos;s action is unique in the world and ie in direct conflict with modern maritime practice.     It differs from our own practice under the old navigation laws, in that Portugal discriminates even against the ships of the country whence the goods are imported or for which they are destined.The following are the main objections to Portugal&apos;s action from our point of views-(1) It is at variance with maritime practice and is a disturbing factor in international relations.     It is tending to dislocate our trade with Portugal since importers and exporters in Portugal tend to stipulate for carriage in a national ship in order to get the rebate.     Not enough ships under the Portuguese flag are available and goods have to be sent to a continental port for shipment, or cannot be sent at all.(2) As the greatest shipowning country in the world it ie important to us that our ships should have free access to foreign ports under equal conditions with national ships, and in our Commercial Treaty negotiations we press for national treatment for our ships as strongly as we do for most-favoured-nation treatment for our goods.     There is a danger that if Portugal is allowed to persist in her action the old trouble of flag discrimination may be revived in other countries which are trying to stimulate mercantile marines of their own, notably, the United States. Poland, Spain, France, Italy, etc This is a point of great importance to us as a seafaring-country.The Portuguese Mercantile Marine is too small to be a danger in itself and has not expanded, though it is alleged by the Chamber of Shipping that Portuguese ships are finding full cargoes, whereas foreign ships are sailing half empty.
(3) A further subsidiary effect is that as Portuguese Bhips serve continental ports such as Rotterdam and Hamburg, trade is tending to pass to our continental competitors, who have not the additional cost of carriage across the North Sea.We have had a Commercial Treaty with Portugal 3ince 1914, the conclusion of which followed on a long series of fruitless negotiations extending over twenty years.     The main object with which this Treaty was concluded was to meet the complaint of British exporters that, in the absence   of such a Treaty, certain descriptions of British goods did not enjoy the benefit of the reduced duties that Portugal accorded to similar goods originating from other countries with which they had concluded Treaties,     The range over which such discrimination was exercised was not, in fact, very considerable, but in the particular goods concerned the United Kingdom was unable to compete.     Eventually we secured most-favoured-nation treatment for our goods, but were only able to do so by giving in return an undertaking to pass legislation confining   the use of the terms Port and Madeira to wines the produce of the Douro district and Madeira respectively and certified by the Portuguese Government to be entitled to those descriptions. The Portuguese insist, in fact, in including a Clause to this effect in all the Commercial Treaties they conclude.When negotiating this Treaty an endeavour was made to secure the inclusion of Clauses in the form usual in such instruments which would have clearly entitled our shipping to national treatment in Portugal in all respects, but the Portuguese refused to agree to these Clauses and insisted on replacing them with provisions for most-favoured-nation treatment only. It has alwayshitherto been assumed that the Portuguese action in giving a preference to goods carried under the
*3 n Q J U OPortuguese flag could not be challenged as in conflict with the Treaty and representations have never been made to the Portuguese Government on the ground that it was contrary.Recently, however, the Chamber of Shipping obtained the opinion of Sir John Simon and Sir Robert Aske as to the legality of the Portuguese action, having regard to the provisions of this Treaty.      Put shortly, their opinion was that (1) Portugal is debarred from charging higher duties on British goods carried on British and foreign vessels than are charged upon British or other goods carried in Portuguese vessels, because the Treaty accords to British goods, without qualification, the benefit of the lowest duties charged on similar goods of any other origin; (2) That the general provision of Article 1 of the Treaty which gives liberty for British subjects to go with their ships and cargoes to Portuguese ports and which accords &quot;full and complete freedom of commerce and navigation&quot; between Britain and Portugal is not consistent with discrimination against the cargo of a ship merely because she is flying a British and not a Portuguese flag.Having regard to this opinion, the Chamber of Shipping suggested that the question of our rights under the Treaty should be referred to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty itself.The opinion was submitted to the Law Officers of the Crown who have reported generally in the following sense:(l) That British goods imported in a British ship are protected both by Article 5 which secures unconditional most-favoured-nation treatment for British goods and by article 11 which secures most-favoured nation treatment for British shipping;
(2) That British goods imported in a non-British ship are protected by Article 5 only; and(3) That non-British goods imported in a British ship are protected only by Article 11.The result, therefore, is that they support Sir John Sixnon in the first but not in the second of his contentions, and consider that British goods imported in a British ship are entitled to exactly the same treatment as British goods or, indeed, any other foreign goods - imported in a Portuguese ship; that British goods imported in, say, a German ship, are similarly entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment, but that non-British goods imported in a British ship may be discriminated against without breach of the Treaty.Since they obtained and forwarded the legal opinion by Sir John Simon and Sir Robert Aske, the Chamber of Shipping and associated bodies have somewhat changed their attitude, and now incline to favour some action other than arbitration on the Treaty position, because they think that arbitration would be a long drawn out process.     They asked, therefore, in a Deputation which I received some weeks ago, that the question of denouncing the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty should be seriously considered as they were of opinion that an alteration of the position could be secured more rapidly by this means than by any other.     In pressing for this threat of denunciation, if the Portuguese Government should not give way, the Chamber of Shipping were supported by the Association of Chambers of Commerce of the United iilngdom and the Federation of British Industries.     The latter bodies were aware that there was some risk that, this might involve us in economic warfare with Portugal, but they
appeared to think that the advantages that Portugal secures for her wines under the Treaty are euoh that she would never willingly allow the Treaty to go.It cannot, however, be assumed that the mere threat of denunciation of the Treaty would have the effect of inducing the Portuguese to drop their practice of flag discrimination.      If the threat of denunciation were,  in fact, made and if the Portuguese in reply refused to remove the discrimination,  it is dear that the threat would have to be carried out.     It is important, therefore, to consider what would be the effect on British trade of such denunciation.    The most effective weapon of attack against Portuguese trade would, of course, be the taking away from Port and Madeira of the monopoly of those terms that they now enjoy;    once the Treaty ceased to have effect this could be done hy the repeal of the .-uiglo--Portuguese Commercial Treaty Acts, 1914 and 1916, and thus Empire and other (e.g. Spanish) wines of a port character might lawfully be described as &quot;Australian Port&quot;, &quot;Spanish Port&quot;, etc.      The result of any such action on our part would, however, be that British goods would become liahle to the maximum tariff in Portugal in place of the minimum tariff which they enjoy at present.    In this event We should certainly be far worse off than we were prior to 1914, when Portugal had a general tariff applicable to goods irresoective of their origin, and oertain lower conventional duties on a relatively small number of oroducts,  conceded as a result of treaties with France, Russia and the Netherlands.    Now there is a complete two-column tariff, and the general duties are in the main, two or three times the minimum duties.     T/e should, therefore, be faced with the certainty of very greatly increased duties on the whole range of our
exports to Portugal, and not, as was the case &quot;before the Treaty, of discrimination in a few articles only.The minimum tariff is applied to goods originating in countries to which this privilege is ensured by commercial treaties and automatically ceases to apply in the absenoe of such treaties.    It is true that the Government have power to accord the same treatment to goods originating in countries in which Portuguese goods are subject to minimum tariff treatment and that the cases in which the maximum tariff has actually been enforced are few and far between.     Nevertheless,  it is difficult to believe that the Portuguese Government would tamely take the necessary positive action to enable British goods to continue to enjoy the benefit of the minimum tariff immediately after the declaration of economic war, which is what the denunciation.of the Treaty would come to.The total value of our exports and re-exports to Portugal have stood at round about -24,000,000 a year for the four years up to 1929, exports of goods of United kingdom manufacture being about  3-g million in 1929. These are a few examples of the effect of subjecting British goods to the general tariff:- Hlxports of British coal to Portugal in 1929 were valued at  835,000; the minimum duty is l/7d.  per ton,  the maximum duty 5/- per ton.      Ouch a duty vould, presumably, mean the total loss of this trade.      Exports of coke and patent fuel were valued at  36,000, minimum duty l/10d.  per ton, maximum 5/5d. per ton,,    Cotton piece goods were valued at  387,000 of which  215.000 was dyed pieoe goodsj    the minimum duty on dyed piece goods ranges from I/lld.  to 3/ld.  per lb..,    the maximum duty being double.      Jute yarn exports&apos;.    S132,000, minimum duty 2/3rrd; maximum duty double..    Copper Sulphate valued at  85,000, minimum
duty 4/7d. or 11/51-d. according to the purity, maximum duties 6/lOf-d. and 34/4f-d., respectively.   Machinery valued at  327,000;    duties varying from  1.7.6 per cwt. to 4/7d. per owt., the maximum duty in each case being either double or more than double.   Electrical goods,  63,000, maximum duties about twice the minimum duties.   Motor vehicles  83,000, maximum duties rather more than double the minimum duties.   Tin plate  347,000 minimum duty 18/-, maximum duty  2.14.0d. per ton.It should also be remembred   that in the absence of a Treaty there would be nothing to prevent discrimination of still more flagrant kinds against British shipping in Portuguese ports.It is clear, therefore, that denunciation of the Treaty is not a course which can be undertaken without grave danger to our Portuguese trade.   Moreover, I think It would be most undesirable for us to denounce a Commercial Treaty in the present state of Europe if it can possibly be avoided.    In these circumstances I am strongly averse to denouncing the Treaty.The possible alternative of taking the matter to arbitration on the lines suggested by the Law Officers does not commend itself to me for the following reasons.(1) If the Court decided, as the Law Officers advise they should, we should be faced with the awkward position that British goods carried in British ships would receive better treatment than non-British goods carried in British ships.   Prom the point of view of Portuguese trade, this would five our shipowners practically what they want, but the establishment of such a position might have very awkward repercussions for us as the greatest general carriers in the world, e.g., in America, where our ships are doing a good deal of trade between non-British countries with non-British goods.
The value of Portuguese trade to our shipping is small compared with our general carrying trade.   We might, in short, gain the greater part of our point with Portugal by the costly sacrifice of principle.(2) If we lost our case our  position would be worse than it is now.(3) I am reluctant to propose that we should take advantage of a technical interpretation of the Treaty which was clearly not contemplated by the negotiators at the time when it was made, for the purpose of securing a right which at that time we had deliberately foregone.(4) The fact that when the Treaty was negotiated national treatment in the matter of shipping was asked for by His Majesty1s Government, and most-favoured-nation treatment accepted, might make it, in my opinion, at least doubtful whether a Court of Arbitration would necessarily decide In our favour.   It is true that the Law Officers have expressed the view that in an international arbitration we should probably succeed (to a large extent), but it has to be remembered that for this purpose we should not be able to have recourse to the International Court of Justice at the Lague.   We should have to depend on the decision of three Arbitrators chosen under the termB of Article 22 of the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty, viz. one British subject, one Portuguese citizen,and an Umpire of a third nationality chosen by the other two or, if they cannot agree, by lot. Such a tribunal is obviously one on which it is difficult to rely.If, however, both these suggested courses, viz. denunciation of the Treaty and a referenceto arbitration, are to be rejected, as I think they should be, the question arises whether there Is any other course open to us to bring the   Portuguese to reason.    I venture to think there
I suggest that our Ambassador at Lisbon should be instructed to approach the Portuguese Government once more on the whole matter and to address to them a grave warning some-thing on these lines.    He should state that His Majesty&apos;s Government are being pressed very strongly in this country, not by shipping interests only, but also by commercial and industrial interests,to denounce the Treaty in view of the grave injury to British shipping and trade which results at present from the course pursued by the Portuguese Government.    It is urged that the discrimination against British interests practiced hy the Portuguese Government no longer justifies His Majesty&apos;s Government in according to Port and Madeira the exceptional protection which they at present enjoy in the monopoly of the names, Port and Madeira.    At the same time, pressure is continually being exerted on behalf of Dominion wine interests to allow their sweet wines to be called &quot;port&quot; with the addition of a definite indication of origin.    So long as discrimination against British shipping in Portuguese ports is maintained, it becomes increasingly difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to hold out against the combined pressure of these various movements. On the other hand, His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to avoid any course which would involve a rupture of economic relations between the two countries, and they are therefore prepared to make a definite offer.    This offer is as follows:-His Majesty&apos;s Government will be ready to enter into anagreement maintaining for a further specific term of years(e.g. 5 years) the provisions of the existing Treaty whichsecured to Portuguese wines the monopoly of the name by whichthey are known, subject only to the Portuguese government being ready to modify the Glauses of that Treaty which relateto shipping and to replace them by a guarantee of full nationaltreatment in all respects for British shipping in Portugueseports.    If the Portuguese were willing to enter into negotiations for an agreement of this kind, which would be one-10-
supplementing and extending the existing Treaty that would otherwise he unaffected, we should he villing to submit to them a draft agreement.It seems to me that it is by no means impossible that, if properly presented to the Portuguese Government, this offer to extend for a further period the main advantages which they at present derive from the Treaty may have the desired effect, and I should be glad to have the concurrence of my colleagues in this course.w.G.Board of Trade 4th July, 19 31.
