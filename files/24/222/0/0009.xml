f THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT) . S E G R E T.Copy No.    C.P. 158 (51).CAB IN S T.PRESIDENT HOOVER&apos;S PROPOSAL FOR SUSPENSION OF DEBT PAYMENTS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.His Majesty&apos;s Government having announced their acceptance of the American proposal,  in principle,  and their readiness to co-operate in carrying it into practical effect without delay,   the following action is recommended for this purpose:-(1) Reparations.. It is most urgent, if possible,  to secure the agreement of the principal creditor^governments to the suspension of the German Payments as from 15th July when the next instalment is due.      The simplest method would be for the creditor governments to notify the Bank for International Settlements of such suspension.     This suggestion has been made unofficially to the French Government and they will probably consult us as soon as their Cabinet has considered the American proposal.      It is probably unwise in view of French susceptibilities,  for H.M.   Government to go further at this stage.      If the French Government accept the principle of suspension we can probably agree without difficulty on a procedure for carrying it into effect.      If they are going to raise difficulties about the principle,   the United States have better means of bringing them round than we have.      For  the moment,  therefore,  no action is advisable in regard to France.1 ./ Belgium, France,  United Kingdom,  Italy and Japan.
( 2) Othei-&quot;^Internajtiotiai Debts.In view of the terms  of the American proposal, H.H.   Government will be bound to agree to the suspension of all international payments due to us by Europe.      If we are to sacrifice the cash,  we may as well get the maximum credit for it by announcing our acceptance immediately and thus helping to push the proposal through.It is suggested that the best procedure would be to announce forthwith that as soon as President Hoover&apos;s proposal has been generally accepted, H.M-  Government will be ready to suspend for one year all international debts due to them by European countries and that in the meantime they will refrain from claiming instalments  that may fall due.Further steps should be taken by the Treasury to convene immediately a meeting of the Relief Credits Committee with a view to informing the other Governments holding Relief Bonds of our action and inviting them to take similar action.      (The Relief Bonds provide that the debtor country must treat all creditor Powers pari passu). (3) Dominions and India.The obligations of  the Dominions and India to the United Kingdom are a domestic matter for the British Commonwealth and cannot be made the subject of uniertakings to foreign Powers.      But taking account of the economic and financial difficulties with which most of the Dominions are at grips,  it would appear impossible to refuse to them the concessions which, we have agreed,  in principle,   to grant to Germany.      Moreover,  the Dominions are themselves  creditors of Germany and could make their acceptance of the American proposal contingent on our agreeing to a suspension of their debt payments.      In these circumstances, it is suggested that we should inform the Dominions and the Government of India
of the American proposal, invite their assent to the suspension of the German payments and say that we are prepared to give them the option of postponing the full amount of their war debt payments  to the United Kingdom for a period of a year if they desire to avail themselves of this facility., (if) Financial effect to the British Budget.The effect on the British Budget of the above proposals will be a loss of nearly  11  millions,  made up as follows:-(a) Net Reparations Surplus      700,000 (Over and above our Amerisain debt)(b) Relief and Reconstruction debts  2,300,000(c) Dominions and India  7,700,000 10,700,000If we add the Australian Sinking Fund payments ( 1,600,000) which we have already agreed to suspend,  the total loss is over  12 millions.The extent of this sacrifice, in our present Budgetary position,  is serious,  and has not been realised by public opinion at home or abroad.      On the contrary,  it has generally been assumed that the French would be the main losers by the American proposal.      If therefore H.M.  Government agree to theapplication of the proposal on the above lines, it is suggested that an early opportunity should be taken to make a full statement on the subject in the House so that our position may be properly appreciated.      Nothing is more likely to influence France in the direction that we desire than the discovery that this country also loses a very substantial amount from the American proposal.A detailed memorandum is attached explaining these proposals in fuller detail.P.S.isury Chambers,  S.7/.1. 23rd June,  1931 .
ANNEX.MEMORANDUM BY THE THEA.SUBY OK PRESIDENT HOOVER1 ,S PROPOSAL.1.        The Position-p.f G-erman.v .The financial situation in Germany during the past two weeks had become critical,  owing to the withdrawal of foreign money from Germany,  and the Reichsbank would in all probability have had to inflate the currency and/or to suspend payments in gold before the end of this month.        President HooverTs proposal for a moratorium in regard., to inter-Governmental debts, while only a temporary and provisional measure, has already eased the tension and should go far to restore confidence.        But for this purpose it is most important that it should rapidly be made effective. Unfortunately, President Hoover has contented himself with a general declaration and has left it quite obscure what the next step shall be.The obvious thing, no doubt, would be for the principal Creditors of Germany to announce their acceptance of the American proposal and to inform Germany accordingly.      But there seems   little chande of such action being taken before the 15th July, when the next instalment of the German annuities is due to be paid.The main obstacle to such action will probably be the desire of Prance to retain the unconditional annuities provided for in the Young Plan
which amount to  30 millions altogether,  of which  25 millions are paid, to Prance.      The net loss to France from the acceptance of the American proposal would,  however, be much less than her full share of the unconditional annuities.      For, under the Young Han,  if Germany pays the unconditional annuities but suspends the postponabie annuities,  France is required to put up a Guarantee Fund of   5 millions to compensate the other Powers for her disproportionate share of the unconditional annuities of which  2-f- millions has already&apos; been deposited with the B.I.S.      Out of this Fund the actual amount that would be due to the other Creditor lowers during the first year of suspension would be  9 millions.      In audition,  France would have to pay  800,000 to the United Kingdom in respect of the special annuities agreed upon at.the first Hague Conference so that her net receipts would be only  13 millions Further,  if Germany paid the unconditional annuities, France would have to pay such part of Her war debts to the   United States and to the United Kingdom as she has not the right to postpone under the Funding agreements, amounting to  6,500,000 in the current year.      Thus, the net loss to France resulting from the complete suspension of payments as compared with a partial suspension under the Plan, would, not be more than  6,500,000.On the other hand, the unconditional annuities are the ark of the Covenant to France.    In the terms of the Plan they constitute unconditional obligations of Germany ranking as ordinary commercial obligations and it will not be easy to induce any French Government voluntarily to renounce these annuities.     Moreover, they may refuse to take immediate action on the plea that any renunciation requires Parliamentary sanction:    and,  if so, their attitude will probably be supported by Belgium and
(possibly)  by Serbia each of which has also a reparation &quot;surplus&quot; of smaller amounts.    On the other hand,  it is obviously unreasonable to expect the U.S.A.  to renounce their debt claims if France is to continue to collect from Germany the full amount of her reparation surplus.The political forces which this conflict of interest may rouse in France and U.S.A. are formidable and it would be unwise to assume that agreement would be easily reached.      His Majesty&apos;s Government have always regarded it as an unsatisfactory feature of the Young Plan that France should have a prior right to  25 million but having been forced to accept the Plan, we cannot very well intervene actively, to induce the French Government to waive their rights under the flan.    One course would be to inform.the French Government.officially that the Government accept in principle the American proposal and are prepared to agree to the complete suspension of the French war debt payments to them, provided that the proposal is accepted all round and that in consequence the German    payments are also suspended in full;    and to inquire whether the French Government are willing to join with us in a communication to the Bank for International Settlements to this effect. But it would seem unwise to us to take upon ourselves the advocacy of the American proposal,  as we are likely thereby to give the appearance to French public opinion of having concerted with the United States to put pressure on France.      H.M. Government have publicly announced their acceptance of the American proposal and the French Embassy have been informed,  unofficially,  of our views as to the necessity of prompt action to carry it into
effect . vVe need net assume that the French Governmentwill make difficulties but if they do,  it seems best for us to keep out of the ring- and leave 1 resident Hoover to induce France to accept a sacrifice in common with the other creditor lowers.      As a matter of fact, having regard to the exchange position of Germany,  it is more than probable that Germany will not be  able to effect the payment on the 15th July and will bring matters to a head by so informing the Bank for International Settlements.      Indeed, there is something&apos;to be said for this course, as it may be easier for the French Government to accept a fait accompli of this kind than to agree spontaneously to abandon her rights under the Young IIan.One proposal which may be put forward is that payment should continue to be made by Germany in the form of bonds instead of actual cash.      This might be considered, if necessary, to secure the acceptance of all the Governments concerned to immediate action^    but the history of reparations is strewn with valueless papers of this kind and it is undesirable to have recourse to such legal fictions again, if it can be avoided.It may also be suggested that the Bank for International Settlements should set up the Advisory Committee which was to be convened under the Young Plan in case cf a suspension of transfers, but there is little utility in setting up such a Committee under present conditions and the Governments must handle the situation in direct consultation if valuable time is not to be lost and the full year of suspension pass without any settlement.
2o    The scope of the suB^r-oicri..Unfortunately, President Hoover did not confine himself to proposing the simultaneous suspension of German reparations and of Inter-Allied war debts, which would have covered 98$ of the total of inter-national debts (excluding Dominion debts).    His proposal contemplates the postponement &quot;during one year o of all payments on all inter-Governmental debts,reparations and relief debtsr    both principal and interest&quot;.    While these wide terms look simple, they in fact complicate matters by requiring universal agree-ment before action can be effectively taken.    It is true that American action is said to be &quot;conditional on a postponement for one year of &quot;all payments of inter-Governmental debts owing to the important Creditor -Powers&quot;, but this leaves the scope of the debts to be suspended unlimitedcIf the United States Government are going to insist on the suspension of all Inter-Governmental obligations, it will be difficult to avoid prolonged delays which.may seriously affect the possibility of maintaining stability in Germany.    In particular there are three categories of debts which it would have been desirable to exclude.(a)      The annuities payable by Hungary and Bulgaria under the Hague settlement.    The payments of these countries were scaled down to moderate and manageable figures by the Hague Agreement ( 300,000 a year in the case of Hungary and  400,000 a year in the case of
Bulgaria).    Moreover,  the principal Creditor Poy/ers agreed to pay over their receipts to certain funds which are to he applied to meeting the claims of the Roumanian optants and other Hungarian nationals. Therefore3 the suspension of these payments by Hungary would in effect prejudice the position of Hungarian claimants.    On the other hand,  three-quarters of the payments by Bulgaria go to Greece, and Greece has always maintained that If these payments were to stop, she would stop making certain payments to Bulgarian nationals in respect of properties left by them in Greece as part of the process of the Exchange of Populations after the T.;&apos;ar.    It seems clearly inadvisable to stir up all the difficulties in Eastern Europe which were laid to rest by the Hague Settlements and it would be best to leave these payments aside, at any rateP  in the first instance.(b)    Rellef 9 Repatriation and Reconstruction.,Loans. The United States Government have treated these as analogous to war debts, but H.M. Government have never so regs.rded them,  and they have been funded on terms providing for repayment in full, except in the case of Austria.    The receipts which we get from the Relief and Repatriation Loans are comparatively small (about  1-g- millions a year): but the funding agreements provide that the debtor country in each case must treat all  the Creditor Governments on a basis of complete equality and a large number of Governments are involved. Any suspension of these pajonents would^-requl .re the assent of the Governrdents^an^l^gxaD^irures of Hoiland?iCDeraaark,
S3Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, who have no direct interest in reparations, as well as that of France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Australia-In addition,  there are two Reconstruction Loans which we made to Belgium and the Belgian Congo, from which we receive  900,300 a years    These have always heon treated as commercial  debts by Belgium, but they are presumably covered by President Hoover&apos;s formulae(c)    The payments to the United Kingdom by the Dominions and India are presumably not &quot;inter-Governmental payments&quot; within the terms of President Hoover&apos;s proposal.    Certainly, in the view of H*M. Government, such payments constitute a domestic question to be settled between the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations and cannot be the subject of undertakings to other countries.3&quot;      The financial effect of the proposal on the United Kingdom (as distinct from the effect on the current Budget which is dealt with in the next paragraph).(a) If the suspension were limited to German reparations and Allied war debts, we should be practically all square as under the Young Plan we receive little beyond cover for our American debt.    Thus the suspension would involve only a net loss in the year of suspension of.............  700,000,  this being the amount whichwe should now receive in excess of our debt payments to the U.S.A.(b) If the suspension covered also relief etc. debts, our additional loss in the year would be ...........  8,,87 5,000
(c)    If the suspension also covered the Dominion war debts and the Indian War contribution, our further loss would be  ...----. -  7,700 .000Total say  ...  10,700,000**    12^- million including the waiver of sinking fund payments by Australia already agreed to.As regards these alternatives,  (a,)  the loss of  700,000 reparations is one which we must be ready to accept as our contribution to the suspension scheme    (b)    As regards relief etc.  debts, and also as regards Hungarian and Bulgarian reparation payments, these constitute no unmanageable burden on the countries concerned, but H.M. Government will presumably not wish to appear anxious ta qualify their acceptance of the American proposal in respect of these debts and it is suggested that, if all the other Creditor Governments are prepared to join us, H.M. Government should be willing to give the Debtor Governments the option of suspending payments on these debts should they so desire-A considerable number of smallish payments for Relief Debts are due on the 1st July and It is an urgent question whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should notify the Governments concerned of this option, without waiting for any general agreement from the other Creditor Row ors (which may not be easy to obtain).      Relief Credit questions have been dealt with in the past by a Committee of financial representatives meeting in London and if desired, a meeting of this Committee could be convened at once to consider the position.
As regards  (c), the Dominion war debts have never been regarded as analogous to the Allied war debts, since it was the express desire of the Dominions to bear the whole cost of their contingents,  and the advances were aade by His Majesty&apos;s Government instead of the Dominions borrowing on the London market merely as a matter of convenience.    But, tukiiKg    account of the economic and financial difficulties with which most of the Dominions are at grips, it would appear impossible to refuse to  them the concessions which, we have agreed, in principle, to grant to Germany.     Moreover, the Dominions are themselves creditors of Germany and could make their acceptance of the American proposal contingent on our agreeing to a suspension of their debt payments.    In those circumstances, it is suggested that we should inform the Dominions and the Government of India of the American proposal and say that, irrespective of what may come of it as regards other countries, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are prepared to give them the option of postponing the full amount of their war debt payments to the United Kingdom for a period of a year, if they desire to avail themselves of this facility. (^)    Actual cost to present Budget.The above represents the loss which we should sustain In a full year.    During the actual budget year 1931-32 assuming that the suspension comes into force from the 1st July we should have received only 3 months&apos; receipts from reparations and debts before suspension (April, May and June), while we made a half-yearly payment on our debt to America on June 15th.    For this reason our receipts from reparation and allied debts in 1931-32 would fall short of our payments to the U.5.A. by  5,200,000.      But the Budget estimated for a
surplus on this head of  700,000,  so that the loss   involved is nearly  6 million.    (The loss would of course he made good in 1932-33 if payments are resumed on 1st July 1932, as the 11032-3 Budget would contain 9 months receipts to cover the six-monthly payment on 15th December 1932).If the suspension applies to the Dominions, India and Relief Debts the additional loss to the 1931-2 Budget will be -Dominion War Debts.Thus the total Budget loss (including the concession already made to Australia) would be  12 million in 1931-32, but only some  250,000 in 1932-3*This loss will inevitably tend to swell the Budget deficit to an excessive figure0   The amount of the American debt instalment due next December will necessitate some revision of the fixed debt charge, and having regard to the exceptional nature of these losses, it is a question for consideration whether they should not be taken into account in fixing the revised debt charge for the year.    Legislation may be required in the autumn for this purposeo    It will be seen that the American proposal entails the acceptance by this country of a sacrifice of  12 millions in the current year and presumably of much the same amount in future years unless we are again to revert, after a year to the collection of reparations and debts.   The extent of this sacrifice, in our present Budgetary position, is serious and has not been realised (l) Australian Sinking Fund(already suspended) (2) Complete    suspension of all other Dominion debt payments3,029,000 418,000 1,850.000814,000 6,111,000
by public opinion at home or abroad.    On the contrary, it has generally been assumed that the French would be the main losers by the American proposal.,   If therefore Ho Ho Government agree to the application of the proposal on the above lines, it is most desirable that an early opportunity should be taken to make a full statement on the subject in the House so that our position may be properly appreciated.   Nothing is more likely to influence France in the direction that we desire than the discovery that we also lose a very substantial amount under the American proposal,, ( 5) Technical points in regard to German Reparation0(a) The Annuity years and the Suspension year.The German Annuity year and the Budget year for the United Kingdom^ France, Yugoslavia and Greece runs from 1st April to 31st March,    The United States Fiscal year and the proposed Suspension   year run from 1st July to 30th June.    Thus the United Kingdom and other Creditor Powers would have receipts for only 3 months to meet the six-months payment to the U.S0A0 on June 15th0It appears from the recent conversation between Sir R0 Lindsay and Mr0 Ogdsn Mills that the U.S.Treasury are alive to this difficulty*    It would presumably be too much to expect that the United States Government would refund part of the payments made by the United Kingdom, France, Yugoslavia and Greece on June 15th   1931 and arrange that the amounts thus refunded should be paid (in addition to the normal instalments) on   15th December 1932, if full payments of German reparation etc are resumed on 1st July 1932.(b) The Countries with a reparation &quot;Surplus1&apos;.The annual receipts of certain Creditor   Powers overand above the cover for  their war Debts ;      /-11-
are as follows in round fig-ares.Prance 20 millions (of which  15million would be lost in1931-32)Belgium 3-g- million (j^Ius  1 millionunder Paper Marks Agreement)Serbia 3-g- millionItalyitJapan 650,000Canada  800,000 is in a similar position as she has no war debt.(c) As regards de1iveries-in-kind it is open to Creditor Governments to make contracts covering any part of the period up t&amp;j 1939, and to draw Bills up to 90 days,,      The Creditor Governments have considerable amounts standing to their credit to cover future payments for deliveries-in-kind (e.-g. on March 31st they had  6 millions), but when these funds are exhausted any further payments will clearly have to be made by the recipient Powers out of their own resources.    The Board of Trade have been asked to find out the present position as regards forward contracts etc., but in any case there seems to be no real difficulty as regards deliveries-in-kind, and a suspension of transfers tj  this method was of course contemplated v. ithin the framework of the Young Plan.(d) As regards the annuity paid by Germany in respect of paper marks left in Belgium, it is clear that the suspension should apply to this annuity in exactly the same way as to the annuities under the Hague agreemen to
(6)    Procedure for carrying jprop-osal into effect.If the suspension he applied (in the first instance at any rate),  only to German payments and Allied War Debts, the arrangement could under the terms of the Hague Agreement, be carried into effect by agreement between the Powers represented on the Young Committee (viz.  apart from Uo S.A.,Belgium, Prance, Great Britain,  Italy, Japan and Germany). Possibly for the time being, Germany and the other Debtor Governments might be asked to deposit bonds payable on 15th December 1931 on the understanding that,  if the Suspension Agreement has been ratified by Congress before that date,  the bonds payable on 15th December 1931 will be cancelled and replaced by bonds bearing a future date,  in accordance with whatever may have been settled as to the date on which the suspended payments are to be made good.    Meanwhile, a formal Protocol will require to be drafted to provide for the suspension.As regards the procedure for working out technical details both as regards the German annuities in the first instance,  and later on if necessary,  as regards the non-German payments,  there would be considerable advantages in the U. S.  Treasury sending a representative to confer with the other Treasuries in Europe as against one or more European Treasury representatives visiting Washington.    Technical details are matters of comparatively minor importance to the United States, but they may be regarded of great importance to European countries,  and it is often much easier to settle them if direct access to the Ministers of those countries is possible.    For
example,   if there is any question of the suspension of Bulgarian payments to Greece, Mr.Venizelos will certainly claim to suspend his payments in respect of the Exchange of Populations Agreement (Caphandaris-Molloff),  and it will probably be difficult to settle the point without the personal intervention of Mr. Venizelos.    Moreover,  it will be much easier for the British, French and Italian Treasuries to keep in touch if the discussions take place in europe,  ratherthan in Washington.Further, the suspension of reparations anddebts for one year, while it gives a useful breathing space,  settles nothing,  and a revision of the Young Plan as a whole,  will presumably be necessary before the year is ended.    Some sort of conference will be required for this and it would be well for the procedure to be explored as soon as practicable.
