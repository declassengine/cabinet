TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.*st- i\33bIt is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.(THIS POCUllIT9S GOVERNMENT)GAB I N E ToSecret,Copy Ho. 6.0,P.17P(51)1LEGTR.LFICATIQN OF HAH? LIHBRAILWAYS.,Memorandum by the Minister off transport in my memorandum Go&apos;B^Q2(^l), I dealt briefly with the Report of Lord Weir&apos;s Committee on Electrification of tha Main Line Railways,,     In accordance with the Cabinet decision I invited the observations of the Railway Companies upon the Report and have now received their replys of which a copy is annexedowould be of material assistance in bringing about the general electrical development of the country and might enable substantial savings in railway working expenses to be reallsedo They point out, however, that in some respects the financial estimates of the Committee are admittedly open to a wide margin of error.     Railway traffics have not been maintained at the 1929 level which was the basis of Lord Weir&apos;s calculations5    the general level of wages has been altered and due weight should be given to the possibility of further economies in steam worhingo     There are other directions in which the e stimates require close examination and in the Railway Companies9 view any estimates, even after the closest investigations, must remain distinctly speculative.,Committee that the mere magnitude of the sums involved in complete electrification should not rule out such a programme the Railway Companies recognise that electrificationWhile the Railv/ay Companies agree with the

Before doing so., they suggest that the character and measure of assistance, if any, to be rendered by the Government in the execution of any comprehensive scheme should be clearly indicated&quot;,This reply raises large Issuese     It is, I thinks clear that in the existing conditions of trade depression and road competition which our programme of road works is likely to intensify^ the Railways will not? and indeed could not, upon the basis of their own credit commit themselves to an expenditure of many tens of millions upon wholesale electrification?We have, therefore;, to ask ourselves what methodsof securing electrification arc open0
(l)    It would no doubt be possible to induce the Railway Companies to proceed with substantial schemes if we were prepared to find the capital for them or to give them substantial grants in aid on the lines of those accorded under the Development Act of I.929o     For the reasons which they urged when that Act was under discuss lon8 a mere guarantee of debenture issues would nots I fear, give them sufficient encouragement a     Any subsidy to private enterprise on the scale necessary to be effective would, in my oplnlon9 be exceedingly difficult to justifys nor do I think that the case for a subsidy out of national funds is really made stronger by the fact that indirect advantages would be obtained through the spread and cheapening of electricity generally throughout the country as a result of the increased load and facilities for distribution,. Transport and electricity should be self-supporting as public utilities,,(2)   Public ownership of the Railways forms part of our general programme and has been recently pressed upon, us by the Railway Ifeisas (see CP0lj57(5l) of 1st June9 1931) and from other quarters,.     We should be open to criticism if we proposed substantial subsidies to the Railway Oompanios and left them under their present organisation in private ownership,,      It might even be said that we had thrown away a powerful weapon for securing nationalisation by the very fact that we assisted private railway enterprise to electrify, and that the proper course would be to associate nationalisation with eleotrifioation0 Stats action would then procure public benefits which private enterprise had failed to bringsThe Railway Companies would no doubt feel entitled to say that it was unfair to attribute lack of enterprise to them
and that their difficulties were due to a variety of factors imposing on them unreasonable burdens and, in particular,   &quot;to road competition which to some extent bad been subsidised against them and in such a reply there would admittedly be some force,Moreover, nationalisation itself v?ould give rise to serious problems and, in particular, it would be necessary to consider very carefully the position which would arise if a national railway system were left exposed - both on the passenger and on the goods side of its business - to praotioally unrestricted road competition conducted by private enterprise,, We might have to extend the scope of a national scheme to embrace at least long-distance road transport sent many formidable oppositions and obstacles would be encountered,,It would be necessary to work out in detail the financial basis upon which the transfer of the Main Lines to some form of public ownership should be effected and also the precise form which that ownership should take.     The future efficiency of a nationalised system would largely depend upon the adoption of a well-devised type of organisation suitable to the special circumstances and I do not think that any existing model could be followed without important modificationso(5)   It is possible that the Central Electricity Boards in addition to providing the transmission lines and sub-stations and to supplying the current from the Grid at those sub-stations, should also undertake responsibility for the electrification of the railway track and the supply of current at the point of contact with the trains^      Such an arrangements, though not proposed in the Weir Report, would probably on investigation prove to be feasible and, by transferring to the Central Electricity Board the greater part of the capital expendituref would make it far easier for the Railway Companies to proceeds
They would,, of course, have to pay a price for the current supplied which would enable the Board to meet the interest and sinking fund charges on the Board4 a capital, but would themselves only have to find additional capital in so far as it was required in connection with rolling stock and sxibaidiary purposes.     If the work of equipping the traok were undertaken by the Central Electricity Board, we should secure the Important additional advantage of a high degree of centralised technical cent rol o(4)    One cannot but be attracted by the scope of Lord Weir&apos;e proposals and I agree with him that their adoption, would have far-reaching psychological effects and might-bring about a new-spirit of enterprise on the part of the Railway Companies and, by the stimulus given to employments do much to revive the spirit of our people.      It would no doubt, therefore, be better, if possible, to secure at the outset electrification of the Main Lines on a large scale, though it may be neither necessary nor expedient to ask the Railway Companies or the Central Electricity Board to commit themselves to complete electrification of the whole railway system throughout the country      At the same time it would not be right to ignore the possibility of making substantial progress on less ambitious lines,     A series of suburban electrifications in our great cities might leads, and probably wuld leadj, to the s*api&amp; linking up of the electrified centres.The whole problem is so vast in its implications that I should welcome an opportunity of disoussiag it with my colleagues before formulating any definite recommendations.     They may think it well to review the matter in relation to our whole industrial and commercial policy eo far as It is connected with the organisation and conduct of public utilities,.
(Initialled)   H0MoI recognise also that our plans must be influenced, by the financial position and by our general legislative programme and Parliamentary timetable     But I am anxious that I should be enabled to praoeed with the formulation of definite proposals aimed at securing a substantial extension of the eleotrifioatioa of the railways at an early date and also to draw up some plan for dealing with the Main Line Railway Companies9 whose position must be a dominating factor in any national scheme of transport,,
558 Parliament Streetp Westminster8 SoWolo26th Junes, 1951oDear Sir8The Railway Companies have given careful consideration to the conclusions contained in the Report of the Committee on Main Line Electrificationo     They observe that, while the Committee make no recommendations their main conclusions ares -(1)   That the fullest economic advantage of RailwayElectrification can only be secured by a comprehensive scheme embracing substantially the whole Railway system of the country.(2)   That the electrification of the Railways would involve an additional capital expenditure, spread over a period of 20 years9 of approximately  341,0008000 of which  261,000s,000 would be the new capital involved on the part of the Railway Companies.(2)    That the estimated economies resulting from completeElectrification would yield to the Railway Companies an ultimate return on the capital expenditure involved of 60 Jfo and the prospective growth of suburban traffic an additional 202$oThe Railway Companies recognise that the Electrification of the Main Line Railways would be of material assistance in bringing about the general electrical development of the countryp and might enable substantial savings in railway working expensesto be realised,,The Financial results Indicated by the Committee are9 however j, based upon broad assumptions which are admittedly&apos; open to a wide margin of errop0     Already in two respects important changes have taken place which would adversely affect the estimated savings to a considerable extent, the first being that Railway Traffics have not been maintained at the 1929 level8 and the second that the general level of wages has been alteredo It is also left that due weight ehould be given to the possibility of further economies in steam workingo     There are other directions in which the estimates appear to require close examinations but with so many variable factors to be taken into consideration it is obvious that8 even after the fullest investigation, any estimates for a scheme of such magnitude involving a complete alteration in the haulage system of the Railways must remain distinctly speculative^,The Railway Companies concur in the view of the Committee that the &quot;mere magnitude of the sums involved in complete Electrification of.Railways should be no&quot; deterrent in itself to the moat careful and earnest consideration of such a programme on its economic and social merits&quot;a     It is clear8 however8 that the Companies could not finance such an expenditure cut of their own resources even if they could rely upon obtaining the financial return indicated by the Committee in their report In the view of the Companies this return is of such a speculative character that the raising of money from the public on the Companies0 owi credit would be impossible; moreover, the capital expenditure to be incurred might prove an overwhelming burden upon the Companies&quot; existing financial position in certain eventualities, viz 1-COPYo
(l) If for unforeseen reasons the benefit to be realised proved to be much less than is contemplated in the Report of the committee (S)    In the event of further diminution of rail traffic due to road development and competition,, continued bad trade, decline in the Coal Industry, etoo(5)    In the event of the discovery of some cheaper form of power for Railway purposes or poorer distribution..Viewed as a scheme of general national importance, and with national assistance on a scale commensurate to its importance, the proposal is one which the Railway Companies would be prepared to consider fully, and, if so desired, they would put forward definite and constructive suggestions for the completion within the next decade of a substantial instalment of a comprehensive systemo     Before doing so, they suggest that the character and measure of assistance, if any, to be rendered by the Government in the execution of any comprehensive scheme should be clearly indicated^Yours faithfully,(Sgdo) CHURCHILL *Chairman of the Railway Companies8 AssociationsThe RtcHonc Herbert Morrison, MoPc , Minister of Transport, Whitehall,5 9 W a X o
