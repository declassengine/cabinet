THIS BOCUMEN&quot;? IS THE EROPEB3Y OF HIS BHI3EAITMIG MAJESTY&apos; 3GJOTllWFllT.COPY NO .   35,p,185(3l).CAB I N E 3*.moray FLBS3.[emorandum by the First Lord of the Admiral l:y.ortanoe to -power of irletlon ofi-Serial limits.1.      She proposal of the Secretary of State for Scotland that His Majesty1s Government should ol&amp;im the Moray Firth as within the exclusive fishery limits of the United Kingdom raises en issue which is of very great importance ss regards the Naval defence of the Jppire.20     It is generally recognised in international law that exclusive fishery limits are synonymous with territorial waters (see paragraph G below).     a claim to the Moray Firth am within exclusive fishery limita is therefore equivalent to an admission by His Majesty&apos;s Government that all large inlets similar in configuration to the Moray Firth can be claimed as territorial.3c      It is of great importance to the Strategy of a Naval Power that territorial waters of all neutral countries should be restricted as much as possiblesIhe existence of large areas of water all over the world from which belligerent activities are excluded must have a very restrictive effect upon the Power that has command of the sea.4.     2o avoid arousing the hostility of neutral countries our Navy will be obliged to respect the neutrality of waters claimed as territorial, and would thus be debarred from the use of bays and large inlets as bases of operations.     &apos;JEhe position in south America may*b 6 o h o *
&quot;be specially instanoed as showing the importance of maintaining oar present policy.     We have no &quot;bases there apart from the Falkland Islands, so that there are many thousands of miles in which oruisers engaged in protecting oar trade are entirely dependent for fuelling on the use of &quot;bays in whioh they can get shelter outside the 3-mile limit.      She dosing of the Moray Firth would probably result in making it impossible for us to use yhese bays as vne have done without protest on innumerable occasions in the past.5.     Eaters in whioh belligerent action is precluded afford, moreover, a ready means of escape for enemy war vessels and ships carrying contraband, since the special legal status of territorial waters provides that belligerent ships entering the territorial waters of a neutral Power are not only not liable to internment, as sre military forces entering neutral territory, but whilst immune from attack may make full use of those waters provided they do nob do so to such an extent that it could be shown that they wore using them as a base of operations.2he closing of inlets similar to the Moray Firth would mean that both in lazrope and elsewhere the existence of countless dosed areas of water of large extent would render the Navy impotent at every turn,6.     &quot; he 10-aiile rule in respect of bays embodied in the Korth Sea Convention has been instanced to prove that the Navy is not affected, as exclusive fishery limits could be kept apart from general territorial water limits.     This rale for bays is, however, a very important example of the grave danger of conceding exclusive rights for fishing outside territorial waters by special convention.      In spite of strong opposition by the Admiralty, it may be said, though the position is not quite definite,  that wo have been compelled to acquiesce inthis.....
tliis 10-mile rule for bays being accepted as a general rule of international law.     Many eminent authorities on international law, inoluding Sir Cecil Hurst, the late legal adviser to the Foreign Office, in interdepartmental discussions and also in on article published in the British Year Book of International Law, have consistently maintained that tire Fishery conventions had established a general rule of inter-national law on this point.     fhe Admiralty therefore view with alarm this proposal which involves the concession of much more extensive jurisdiction in respect of bays.7.      The question of making such a claim to the Moray Firt?a has for a considerable period been a subject of dispute, and the proposal of the Soottish Office representative on the interdepartmental committee (referred to in paragraph 10 of the Secretary of Staters Memorandum) which drafted the instruc-tions to the delegates to the Hague Conference to press the Moray Firth claim was strongly opposed.      The report of the committee merely suggested that the delegates should recommend the setting up of some small body to investigate all claims by Governments to inlets as national waters and prepare a report for submission to a future Conference.     It was not intended that delegates should put forward a claim to the Moray Firth and there was no agreement or understanding that any claim to the Moray Firth should ever be referred to such a body.With regard to tho penultimate sub-paragraph of paragraph 10, it would appear highly probable that at the 1930 Conference agreement to the three mile belt would have been obtained by the neoessary majority for a convention if this oountry had supported the &quot;adjacent zono&quot; theory, i.e. an additional belt for certain limited administrative purposes not Involving exolusive jurisdiction.     She question of the width of the belt is, however, distinct from the question of inlets,    i cannot.......

In paragraph 7 of the Secretary of Stated Memorandum (a.P.184/31) it is stated that the agreement respecting Granville Bay in the Convention with France constitutes a-precedent for such action.     As regards this I would like to make two points.     First, the area in question does not really constitute a hay at all.     It is an area at the &quot;bottom of tho large inlet of the sea &quot;between the Cherbourg and Brest peninsulas arbitrarily selected in order to cover certain oyster banks.     It does not constitute a precedent for a claim to any particular area cf water being a territorial bay as would a similar recognition of the Moray Firth as exclusive fishery limits.     Such recognition of the Moray Firth might indeed justify France in claiming the whole of the sea area between the Brest and Cherbourg peninsulas. Secondly, the 1839 Convention only definitely reserves the oyster fishing in this area in the so-called Granville Bay. Special considerations arise in the gusq of sedentary fishor-ies.     Moreover, this was merely a bilateral and not a multi-lateral convention like the North Sea convention.9,     The Secretary of State for Scotland, in paragraph 14 of his Memorandum, makes an alternative suggestion of pressing the North Sea Powers to accept the Powers in the Scottish Act of 1895 for prohibiting trawling in any areas under the jurisdiction of His Majesty within 13 miles of the coast.     From the Admiralty point of view, however,  it is unthinkable that the North Sea Powers should be melted to admit British jurisdiction over any waters within 13 miles of the British coast, as prescribed in the Act.      We have persistently maintained our refusal to much more moderate claims on the port of other countries, e0g, Norway,  fv.pa.ra. IS below).XO   * fi.    0   w    *    f
ited 10.      It is important in this connection to note thatatesyour      at the last Conference, this country had a considerable stric-on.        amount of strong support for the view that large inletsmust he considerably enclosed by the land to be regarded as territorial and the United States put forward a formula, for deciding whether the configuration of an inlet Was such as to justify a claim, that would exclude even inlets much more enclosed than the Moray Firth. . . ftkis formula was as a matter of fact provisionally accepted by a majority at a sub-committee meeting.osition        11.      I cannot concede the importance of the point inf theminions.regard to the Dominions made in paragraph 11.      TheDominions have&apos; only in a few instances suggested claiminginlets so opeh as the Horsy Firth and have in practically allcases withdrawn their proposals on the objections to them on general grounds being pointed out to them.orway IS;.      As regards the negotiations with Eorway, referred toad   ll &apos;ssig.   by the Secretary of State in paragraph 12, we were onlyprepared to recognise a number of her large inlets in returnfor her renunciation of her claim to a 4-mile limit and also of her system of base lines round the coast, a very bigconcession.      These in&apos;iet3 are, moreover, not so open as the moray Firth.13.      She configuration of the TShite Sea, referred to in paragraph 13, is quite different from that of the Maray Firth, as it is almost completely enclosed by the land.      iEhe agreement with Sassia, however,  does not embody any recognition by us of the TChlte Sea as within the exclusive fishery limits of ftussia.

The Secretary of State considers that there is a just and reasonable claim for regarding the Moray Firth as within the sovereignty of His Majesty.      $ay such claim, however, must be regarded not solely from the point of view of local interests, but with regard to the general policy of the state and the reactions of other countries.     Prom the point of view of their local fishermen there is no doubt that the Norwegians also have a just and reasonable claim to o 4-mile limit.     Moreover, the just and reasonable grounds for the Scottish olaim would apply to any valuable fishing area much used by looal fishermen just outside the limit of territorial writers anywhere.     But the recognition of such grounds as conclusive would result in an indefinite extension of territorial waters, and therefore cannot bs agreed to.15.      I would call attention to the fact that the view was asserted by more than one country at the recent inter-national conference on territorial waters that all claims to territorial waters are enoroachments and should be restricted&apos; to the minimum.       his is, I think., essentially the attitude for a big maritime power to adopt.     It has been the consistent policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government for a great many years and a very large number of formal protests to foreign countries against claims made by them have been based on it.16.      It is,  in the opinion of the Admiralty, further desirable to remove the anomaly caused by the existence of Scottish fishery acts and bye-laws which purport to claim jurisdiction over foreign vessels outside recognised territorial water limits.     &quot; he spirit of such enactments is in direct opposition to the foreign policy of this country and to the interests of cur $aval defence,,     &apos; hey can, more-over, cause much embarrassment when quoted in reply toprotests.......
