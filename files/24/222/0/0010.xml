f3 TjOOTM--^JS..THS PROPERTY OF, HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOV3RNtflj;MT.p.  159 (31), COPY NO.     cabinet,STATE OF TRADE -- MAY.  1931, Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,(5&apos;rom reports made at the meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council held on June 11th).The reports for May are affected by the Whitsuntide holidays, hut it is clear that there has been no real improvement in the important industries and that in the woollen industry, which recently had shown some improvement, the position has actually deteriorated^     This has been accompanied by further breaks in raw material prices, the wholesale price index moving from 63,6 for April to 62 P8 for May,   (1924 e 100).Employment was affected by extensions of the Whitsuntide holiday,  the numbers temporarily stopped on June 1st .showing an increase over these on April 27th of as much as 112,, 000 j more than half of which is accounted for in the North-Western division,      A slight improvement was shown, however,  in the numbers wholly unemployed which decreased during the month by 2,000.Owing to the incidence of Y/hitsuntide,  it will not be possible to obtain properly comparable statistics relating either to railway traffic or to imports and exports until the figures for June are also available and can be added to those for May.      It is clear enough, however,  from the railway traffic receipts that their general decline has not been substantially interrupted and the provisional conclusion from an examination of the May Import and Export figures is that they do not indicate any material departure from the low level
of the earlier months of the year.There was a small decline in employment in coal mining up to May 18th, after which the figures are affected by the Whitsuntide holidays,,     Up to May 23rd this year,  the output of coal has been at a rate about 12^% less than in 1930;, and the fall in the rate of exports during the same period waB 28^o     Part of these decreases are due, however,  to the stoppage in South Wales in January.      Omitting January the decline in output as compared with 1930 has been 10,,7^i and in exports 25%, The Central Council have fixed the quota for the July/September quarter on the basis that demand will be between A% and 5^o less than in the same period last year.     It was pointed out that, owing to the general depression,  the demand for industrial coal has declined more than the demand for other kinds of coal, so that it has been impossible to prevent the accumulation of smalls.     The reduction of 2s.6d. a ton in the price of Northumberland smalls which was reported in April was, however, partly taken back last month when the price was raised again by 1/-.Competition from the Continent continues to be very severe.     The part of the Swedish railway contract placed in this country appears to have been obtained only at exceptionally low prices.     The French Government moreover is being strongly pressed to restrict the import of coal; already,  it is understood, public utility companies in France have been &quot;instructed&quot; to use French instead of imported coal.There is no sign of improvement either for land sale or export.No change of importance is reported in the iron and steel industry.     Production of both iron and steel was slightly higher in May than in April, and the number of furnaces in blast increased by one.     Continental prices for export continue to fall0.    Steel joists, which cost .&apos;&apos;35r.12s,6d. a ton f,o,b,
Antwerp in September, 1929,  cost :&apos;i3.8s.0d. now,  and steel bars fell in the same period from i35.2s.6d, to  3.5s.0d.     It is calculated that orders from abroad for steel rails since October, 1930, have been at a rate less than 25^ of normal.There is no improvement to report in the shipbuilding and ship repairing industries, and employment has again declined somewhat.      The Shipping freight index has risen from 85 to 88-but there are no other signs of improvement.     The larger business from the Argentine for grain continues, but rates are no higher,  and outward rates for coal have declined somewhat. Russia has apparently stopped chartering for grain altogether for the time being,  and there is very little grain business doing-with the United States and Canada.There has again been a decline in employment in the general and marine engineering industry and the monthly tonnage of machinery exports in the opening months of the present year has been the lowest in post-war years and not much more than half of the tonnage in 1913, which was the maximum pre-war year.The monthly list of Engineering contracts placed with British firms appears to be fairly good, especially for electrical plant;    it includes orders for timber hauling locomotives, wire and tinplate to a total of about  260,000 from Russia.     The first order resulting from the China Indemnity Agreement has been placed for railway materials in this country ( 300,000), and in all  3,500,000 is available for similar purchases.     The Tientsin-Pukow Railway also is buying 16 British locomotives.The outlook in the motor industry is not encouraging and it is expected that employment will continue to decline. There is a fairly stable demand for the small low-priced car, but the commercial vehicle side of the industry especially is now feeling the general depression.     Motor-cars newly
registered in April (the latest date for which figures are available) were less by 13*1 per cent, than in April last year and motor-cycles by 45,5 per cent*      Imports of motor vehicles, however, have fallen very greatly and up to the end of last month were only 25.7 per cent,, of the imports in the corresponding period last year, or if chassis are included,  32%. The export position remains difficult and the liquidation of American stocks of cars continues to be a disturbing factor, but on the whole British manufacturers are obtaining a larger share of the world&apos;s market than last year and are doing fairly well in New Zealand, South Africa and the Argentine.     The falling off in British exports has been only 27 per cent, compared with a decrease of 47 per cent, in exports from the United States,In the cotton industry the further fall in the price of the raw material after the increase earlier in the year had an especially adverse effect on the spinning section.     The manufacturing section remained depressed, but the finishing trade was slightly better,  especially in prints and colours for the home trade.     No substantial change appears yet to have taken place in the position in India which dominates the industry, but imported piece goods were being sent up country in April in about double the quantities for January.     The trade in cotton piece goods in South America is below normal, and competition from Japan, Russia and continental countries is severe in the Near and Middle East.Unfortunately, the improvement in the wool textile industry which was apparent in the early months of this year has disappeared.     Employment declined last month, and machinery activity,  instead of showing the advance which is expected at this time of the year,  showed a slight decline.     There is,  in fact, a move for further wage reductions as a result of the failure of demand to improve.Most districts report that trade conditions in hosiery, though still poor,  are slightly better;    the improvement is
almost entirely confined to the home trade, export remaining quiet.     Complaint is again made of heavy foreign importations,As regards other industries,  there was a further seasonal improvement in employment in the building trade.      The rubber industry remains depressed except for a slight improvement in motor-car tyres and for a fairly good trade in raincoats. Further competition is complained of in both rubber and leather footwear particularly from Japan and Czechoslovakia in the export market.     There was very little change last month in the chemical industry, but if anything it was for the worse.     The demand for fine chemicals both for home and export is for the time of year exceptionally low.The price of imported wheat declined generally by about 1/-a quarter during May.     In Canada good rains will most likely produce a normal crop.     The United States Farm Board are said to have ceased supporting the market.     The Argentine are still selling freely and Australian exports of wheat for the season to the middle of May were treble the quantity for the corresponding period last year.     Russia is not offering much wheat at present, but good progress is being made in sowing and if the weather is good considerable competition may be expected from Russian wheat in &quot;europe again.The Co-operative Wholesale Society reports an increase of 2.7% in total trade (values)  for the 4 weeks ending May 9th last as compared with the corresponding period of 1930, but the 1930 period contained faster while the 1931 period did not.     Quantities increased in a much greater degree in many instances.      Grain was up 28.8% and flour 18%,  tobacco 32.9%, while the only decreases of importance were cheese 8.1% and coal and sugar both about 5%. The comparison for Departmental Stores relates to April and is partially vitiated by the earlier incidence of Caster this year; it shows a fall in cash sales of 6.6% which has to be considered in relation to the fall in retail prices which based on the Cost of Living Index was 5,1%.-     Stocks   also fell 6,6%,
Board of Trade, 27th June,  1931.The demand for money remains very slight and the chief event of importance in the money market last month was the reduction of the Bank rate to 2i% following the reduction in the Federal Reserve Bank Rate to Owing to the removal of therestriction on quotations for Bills discount rates also declined sharply to about 2t% for 5 months1 Bank Bills.     There was only one new capital issue of any magnitude -  10,000,000 Government of India 6% Bonds, 62% of which had to be taken up by the underwritersThe report from Australia this month is hopeful,.     Imports (by value) for the ten months to April 1931 were considerably less than half those for the same period the year before and exports have kept up satisfactorily, especially wheat, butter, cheese, while the demand for wool is good.     In India figures for the year ending March 1931 show that imports dropped by 30.5fi and exports by 29*2%,  the fall in imports being chiefly one of quantity, that in exports being due to the fall in prices. It was pointed out that owing to improvement in quality India is now selling more cotton than for some time, in spite of the fact that American cotton prices have fallen considerably more in proportion than Indian.     The returns of Colonial trade insofar as they are available for the first quarter of this year show-very heavy reductions in the value both of imports and exports. The general reduction in world trade is also illustrated in the .exports from the United States of America to Argentina for the first quarter of the year,  their value was under  3,000,000 as compared with over  7,000,000 in the first quarter of 1930.

iCKAIRMkN: We are very glad to welcome four members here this morning. I think three of them are quite new to the Council, while one of them is an old member who is returning. They are Mr. Marquis, Mr. Beaumont Pease, Mr. W.E.Rootes, and Mr. Alfred Wagg. We are very pleased to have their presence with us to-day, and we are much obliged to them for kindly agreeing to serve on this Council.ENGINEERING.MR . G.S.ROWLAND:    I have handed in my report.      I am sorry to say it shows no improvement either as regards oroduction or foreign trade figures.      I hope next time I may have something more satisfactory to put before you.RUBBER.SIR GEORGE BBRARRBLL:    Taking tyres first, the replacement business for tyres for motor cars and public service vehicles has shown seasonal improvement during the last two months.      In fact, one might say that the business has been as good as last year in these two instances, but the demand for tyres for first equipment must of course depend upon the degree of activity In the motor car and commercial vehicle industry.     That will be reported on separately.      Motor cycle tyres show a considerable falling off from last year both in first equipment and replace-ment, the former being accounted for in part, and to a very large part, by the  serious drop in the export trade.      Similar conditions obtain so far as cycle tyres are concerned.      I am afraid with regard to the rest of the rubber industry it is a very depressing story.      In rubber thread trade has been poor. Owing to changes in fashion there is a reduction in the potential.      Prices have never been so low relative to cost as they are to-day, and the outlook Is not bright.     with regard to footwear, there has been extraordinary competition both with Japan and the Central European countries, and goods have been sold at uneconomic prices.     Reference was made in some of the newspapers to the very severe competition from Czechoslovakia, and the same conditions obtain in the leather shoe industry. This competition has affected the export market to a very large extent.      In fact, the Japanese manufacturers now dominate the Indian and South African markets, and Japan is rapidly displacing America as the premier exporting country 01 leather shoes.      In sports goods there is very little change in the position.     The business has been very adversely affected by the long series of wet week-ends which we have experienced this year.     The shipping business is about the same as last year.      with regard to surgicals, there is practically no change&apos;.     So far as mechanical rubber goods are concerned, they of course depend on general industry more than any other section of the rubber business, and you know that has been poor, and therefore the demand for general rubber goods has been poor.

Prices have never been so low relative to cost as they are to-day, and the outlook is not bright.

With regard tox see page 39*
VVebonite, the outlook is poor, and the same applies to shoe soles and heels.     With regard to waterproof garments, the market is improving.     We started the year with enormous stocks on the retailers&apos;   shelves, but the last few weeks seem to indicate that the retailers have cleared their stocks and they are now buying in fairly good quantities.MOTOR INDUSTRY.MR. W. E. ROOTES: The past month has shown a very steady decline in the total volume of home sales of motor-cars as compared with 1930,     The volume of the small and comparatively low-priced car output is fairly stable.     But there seems every reason to anticipate falling sales in all parts of the cotxuiry, and the general situation is such that our car manufacturers in general are hesitating to enter into commit-mencs on anything but a conservative basis.     Little change is noticeable in the commercial vehicle field.     The uncertainty of the position in relation to public service vehicle licences is still contributing to the delay in new business, and con-siderable anxiety exists among the small car proprietors. This anxiety on the part of operators of public service vehicles is reflecting seriously upon the manufacture of chassis and omnibus coach work.     The markctfor goods lorries is fairly steady, but there is evidence of a slackening of demand for the lighter-type of commercial truck which in recent months has been comparatively good.Financial difficulties may be expected in certain directions, and the whole of the prospective position is full of anxiety.      The commercial vehicle trade is very definitely faced with a situation that may bring embarrassing results to various manufacturing concerns under the present trade depression.      This trade depression, quite apart from the ordinary fall in industry, has been greatly influenced by the uncertainty of the licensing situation.Competition from abroad, whether in cars or trucks, is tending to disappear, efforts in many cases being made to liquidate old stocks.     The value of imports this year is probably not 25 per cent of the 1930 total.&quot;&quot;&apos;     Exports continue to prasent difficulties.     Australian registrations are approxi-mately 75 per cent below 1930,     British registrations in Australia are comparatively high in proportion and stocks small, but stocks o.f American vehicles are still being liquidated hero as in most markets of the world.     A number of small cars are being imported into New Zealandt and on the whole British sales are fairly well maintained.     The liquidation of American stocks of cars is, however, proceeding apace, and is dislocating British trade.The recent automobile show at the International Exhibition in the Transvaal had the effect of slightly helping sales in that Province, and a small improvement is noticeable throughout the Union of South Africa.      Imports, however, appear to meet immediate enquiries only, and the tendency is to refrain from carrying anything other than bare  stocks.     An all-British* The official figures for the first five months of the year 1931 are for complete cars -  185,246 as compared with  719,266 for the corresponding period of 1930.
exhibition is being held at Durban next month, and the results of that are keenly awaited.      It is thought in the Union that there is a definite development towards British ca:S, and that the exhibition which takes place next month will give a very much better indication as a whole.India is almost stagnant, although there are some signs of confidence returning as enquiries are now being made from the British agencies.     The position, however, is full of difficulties when one endeavours to close contracts.In the Argentine although limited sales of certain cars have resulted from the exhibition at Buenos Ayres, what business there is is restricted by difficulties of exchange. At the same time, certain manufacturers of British cars are offering their products in South America for the first time with reasonable success, and this should induce confidence in development in a market of great potentialities, in addition to which, development in the Argentine will contribute towards an extension of business in other South American districts.British manufacturers have done little or no business on the Continent I am afraid, due to high tariffs and exchange difficulties.      The total volume of British automobile exports is approximately 30 per cent below the 1930 figure&apos;5;&quot;     compared with a fall of nearly 75 per cent from the United States.      It may therefore be said that the British manufacturers in general are obtaining a larger share of the continental and world ma rke t.Opportunities are apparent for British industry to be placed on a stronger basis within the Dominions with the exception of Canada, if arrangements for the free import of certain body parts such as panels could be made.      The body building industry of the Dominion would naturally benefit, and in our opinion a far greater volume of work would in turn help employment within the said Dominions.      In addition, employment in the industry would be assisted in the United Kingdom by the increased exports of chassis and body panels, e tc.      This is a very important feature.    Today the greatest thing the motor industry is up against is the body situation, particularly in Australia.      It is now beginning to apply in regard to New Zealand.     Trre have to pay very heavy duties on bodies into New Zealand.     The cheapest bodies we make in this  country bear a duty of anything from  25 to  45, and if we could have panels shipped in free we should not only create some industry locally, but we should certainly save that duty, and upon investigation we find that the assembly of the body there costs very little more .The position in Canada in view of the tariffs i to render the importation of British cars    almost impossible against the competition of American controlled factories in the Dominion.      This results in a serious situation in so far as Canada is exporting under British preference products fashioned on American lines and is thus contributing towards the world propaganda of the American automobile industry. It is recognised that these factories are within the Empire,* The figures for the first 5 months of the year are - motor oars and parts and accessories (except rubber tyres and tubes)  3,142,701 as compared with  4,392,227 for tho corresponding period of 1930 - a drop of 28.4$.
but at the same time they are entirely fashioned on American standards,  they are controlled by American finance,  and we are faced,  and in my opinion will have to face in the future, more intense competition in Canada, which will bring but very little benefit to this oountry and a great deal to the United States cf America.    I have not got, as probably the Department of Overseas Trade have,  the result of the agreement between Canada and Australia, but according to the Press they have given favour t&amp; Canadian chassis over British chassis in Australia.    If they have given any preference of that sort it virtually amounts to an Amerioan preference and not a British preference.In conclusion, the future trend of events both at home and overseas is such that chassis manufacturers are exercising the utmost caution with respect to future commitments,  and it is almost certain that the volume of unemployment in the motor industry will continue to rise.CHAIRMAN:    With regard to your reference to the sale of American cars through stooks being liquidated, how long do you expect that will go on.?       I suppose there is an enormous supply.MR. ROOTES :    It depends upon the various countries&apos; requirements^    In this country I think it is more or less finished.      Australia has a great many, and New Zealand has a great many.    Africa is again being wound up.    Mainly speaking, you may say that the world as a whole is over-stocked with American produots.CHAIRMAN:    We will take note of your remarks about this agreement between Canada and Australia.    I da not know whether there is any information in the Department.MR. ROOTES:    I am rather speaking before it is published. I only take what the newspapers say.      I have not any faots about it.RETAIL TRAPS.MR.      J,MARQUIS:    I am putting in the usual table showing the retail trade in April*,     The figures are disappointing, but I do not think the statistical implication of them is quite the surface one.    The fact that Easter is at a different period this year has made the whole of the retail figures for April not properly comparable with those of a year ago.       The position for April is that cash sales have fallen by 6.6%. against,  I understand, - a cost of living figure fram the Ministry of Labour of 5.1$t.      The more reliable figure to take is the figure of the first three months of the year, where there has been a fall in this oountry of 4%.It may interest the Council to compare the conditions here with those in other countries.    The departmental stores have suffered more than the general retail trade.    The drop in departmental stores during April has been 9.1/ib in this*   This table is not reproduced as it appeared On page690   of the Board of Trade Journal, May 28th. T   The Ministry of Labour Cost of Living Index was 147 on May 1st 1931,  and 155 on May 1st 1931,  a fall of 5.1?&apos;
country, 9$ in the United States of America, and 20$ in Germany.      But again,  taking the three months instead of the one month as the more accurate indication, the fall in Great Britain has been 2.8$*  in the United States 8%, and in Germany 14.1%.      So that it appears that we are holding our end up rather better than the other principally depressed countries.As regards the position of the larger distributing houses in different parts of the country -ria so far as the April figures are really an indication - the total drop in sales has been 6.6$ for Great Britain as a whole.    In tho West End of London the drop has been 12.5$,  in suburban London 4,8$, the North of England 6.6$ - the same as the average for the whole country - and in&apos;Scotland the drop has only been 3$.You may be interested in the stocks that retailers are holding- since that has an effect on the manufacturing processes. Stocks on the whole are 6.6$ below what they were a year ago -the precise figure of the drop in sales.    That does not indicate that the trade that I represent is so scientifically run that it works to the last decimal point.    I think it is a mere accident that that should have happened.    The drop in stocks in Scotland has been 8$, in London 7%, in the Provinces both North and South 5$, and in London it is about 6.6$.    It is interesting to note that in spite of this drop of 6.6$ in sales and also in stocks, there has been a very slight increase, -g$, in the number of people employed.    I am afraid I cannot explain that unless it results from extra people taken on with a view to coping with holiday trade that did not in fact in its amount warrant an increase in staff. - -With regard to the immediate position for the month of May, the figures are not yet out.     They seem to indicate that the drop in trade will be in the neighbourhood of 4$, the same as for the first three months in the year.    That is a disappointing figure,      I think -it is probable that the continued rain has quite seriously interfered with retail purchasing.I propose, if it meets with your convenience, to give figures of this nature when you ask for reports, and from time to time to make special reports of particular sections of the trade if I think there is anything that might be of general interest.CHAIRMAN:    Thank you.    I am sure the Council will be glad of any of those special reports as well as the ordinary ones. With regard to the figures showing the percentage drops, am I correct in taking it from you that the smaller sales may be . explained simply by the fall in prices?     Is it correct to put the fall in prices against the diminutions you have quoted?MR. MARQUIS:    I think so.CHAIRMAN:    You give the drop as 12.5$ for the West End of London, and the other figures of drop you quoted were 4.8$, 6.6$ and 3$.     The only place where there was any serious fall seems to have been in the West End of London, and it would look as if luxury goods and more expensive goods were not being purchased on account of the results of bad trade.     Would that be an assumption which you would say was roughly correct?
MR. MARQUIS:    I should think that is a fair deduction.    The difference between the 6,6$ and 5.1$ (the Ministry of Labour figure) is really not very considerable.MONEY.MR. J* BEAUMONT PEASE?    The most important event in the money market during last month was the reduction of the Bank Rate from 3$ to 2-1$.   That followed the reduction of the rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lg$ on the 7th of the month, and I think that Is the lowest Bank Rate in Hew York recorded,     The Clearing Banks rate for deposits in the Metropolitan area remained at 1$,  the same as it was previously before the drop in the Bank rate, and the minimum rate of 2$ for money at call and short notice also remained the same.   The amount of call money reraained In comfortable supply during the month, except on one or two days when it commanded 2g- - 2f$, and on the 13th of the month for special causes went up to 5-1$.A short time before the reduction of the Bank Rate, the restriction which had been placed on the quotations for Bills was removed, and the result was that discount rates declined sharply, the average rate at which Treasury Bills were allotted on the 22nd May being just under 2$, against  2.11.0d.$ on the first day of the month.     The rate for full three months&apos; Bank Bills then steadied to about 2^/8%, at which figure it has since stood. During the month there were small issues of Northern Rhodesia and Uganda Treasury Bills which were allotted at rates a little better than those obtained for British Treasury Bills.    The average figures of the Five big Banks for May show that deposits decreased by about  3,000,000 and that there has been a decrease in advances of about  17,000,000 and an increase in Bills discounted of  14;000?000o    The amount of acceptances remained practically unchanged.The holding of gold at the Bank of England was  146,279,000 on the 30th April and  151,017,000 on the 28th May, showing an increase of nearly  5,000.000,Business in the stock market has been quiet with continued shrinkage in the values of miscellaneous and ordinary shares. The market for British Government securities, however, remains on the whole firm, in spite of fluctuations following fluctuations in Foreign Exchanges.    There has only been one issue of any magnitude and that was the 6$ Government of India Bonds amounting to  10,000,000 of which the Underwriters had to take up 62$.On referring to the statistical data here, members of the Counoil will see that the percentage of advances to deposits of the London Clearing Banks is lower than at any time except in 1924-&quot;-, and the money market rates and Bank rate, and so on, indicate that the demand for money is very slight, lower than it has been In any of the periods compared.-&apos;*The Statistical data circulated to the Council gave information received up to June 10th and this percentage for May was 53.9 as compared with 54.3 a month earlier, 54.7 in May 1930, 56.1 in May,1929, and 48.6 In May 1924.
7 &quot; i iCOLONIAL TRADE.MR.G.LaM.CLAUSON:    I will hand in the usual figures for Colonial trade.*     They are rather scantier than usual because this is a fairly early meeting this month,  and it was rather a late meeting last month.      I am afraid they are not very cheerful, but I do not suppose anybody expected they could be.CONDITIONS ABROAD.Since I myself attended the February meeting of this Council I have been to Hong Kong as a member of the Government Commission on the currency question, and as I came back the other way I have been all round the world and I kept my eyes open more or less.      I went out by Malaya and came back across Canada.I think the thing which struck me most was the extraordinary depression of any American that one met.     For instance, I met on the Atlantic the gentleman who corresponds to the President of the British Medical association.     He is one of the principal doctors in New York.     You would think that he would be all right, but he had practically nothing except depression to talk about.      I met a number of British members who had been recently attending the International Chamber of Commerce at New York and Washington, and they told me that their American friends had nothing except the depression to talk about.     They were exceedingly vrarried because they said they had over 5,000,000 unemployed,  and they were beginning to be afraid that unless they did something in the way of State assistance they were going to have regional revolutions on their hands.      I do not know to what extent that is in any way well founded, but as they said, certain parts of the United States,like Kentucky aree xceedingly savage, and they were expecting very serious trouble unless something was done about it.In Japan,  the thing that struck me most was the extra-ordinary high prices.      It seems to me that the cost of living in Japan,  even for the Japanese must be rising.     For the Europeans it is already very high indeed.      The tariff on imported goods is very high, and I cannot help feeling that they are to a certain extent getting themselves into a kind of ring fence like the United States, and that they are bound to find their manufacturing costs rising.     In certain articles they are already ceasing to compete with China.Hong Kong is one of the brightest spots that I have seen.     They are bulging with money.     There are a number of small factories springing up, and those small factories are in fact competing successfully with Japan.      They are benefiting of course from the very low prices of silver.     They live in a silver world where they are very happy.     For instance,  I got some excellent silk socks at a dollar a pair.      That,  at present prices,  is a shilling a pair.      If silver went up they would still be a dollar a pair,  and compared with what it wasSee page 25.
tv/o or three years ago that would &quot;be 2s.  a pair.      So that they are doing very well, and as Japan is on gold prices they are knocking out Japan in that kind of line.As regards China, I was in Canton for a couple of days before the revolution.      Looking at the thing as a whole, it seemed to me that the trouble with China is not really any question of currency or anything of that sort.      It is purely political.     As long as China is in a state of hopeless dis-order, trade is hound to wilt, and nothing that the outside world can do is going to help her very much.      If the silk grower or the pottery manufacturer or the soya Lean grower, or almost any kind of producer in China is quite uncertain whether he is going to get his goods to the coast, the impetus to produce them is negligible.Malaya was feeling pretty low.     Their prices are in gold. They are on a gold currency, and their costs are in gold and they are getting rotten prices.      They were feeling the draught rather badly.CHAIRMAN:    What nationality were the people that you say were doing so well in Hong Kong?MR,  CLAUSON: They were Hong Kong British subjects -Chinese.CHAIRMAN:    I thought you meant they were people who wentout to Hong Kong. They are the people living there.MRo CLAUSON: The Chinese business man in Hong Kong is an exceedingly capable individual, far more capable as a business man, I think, than the Japanese.The position in Japan is extraordinary.      I had a long talk to a grain merchant who had just set up an office there, and he said it is unbelievable how difficult it is to do business in Japan, and he gave me a very simple instance.     When he opened his office he told his clerk to go to the telephone company and get a telephone, but the clerk said you cannot do that.      You have to go tc a broker and get one.     You cannot get a telephone apparatus in Japan except from a sort of private speculator.      There is a thing almost like the stock exchange that deals in telephones.     A member will feel rather bullish one morning, and will go down and buy twenty telephones or so. He went into the market and said he wanted a telephone - simply the apparatus.      You cannot import an apparatus, you have to buy the apparatus from someone who has one.     The first quotation was 1,400 yen,  ( 140).      Finally he got a quotation of 1,100 yen, ( 110).     He closed with that, and the next thing was that he could not get it delivered.      He was told that someone had a lien on it for 6 yen, (lSs), and he paid that.     But there were various other grafts which finally brought up the price to, I think, 1,193 yen.      One charge was 25 yen for moving the telephone from the wall to the table.      It was a new office in which no telephone had ever   been put, but the telephone company said if they had installed it they would have installed it on the wall and therefore they wanted 25 yen, i.e.,  2,10s.Od, for moving it from the wall to the table,     He said that that was quite a characteristic instance of the way business is done in Japan.      I cannot help feeling that perhaps this form of inefficiency may ultimately redound to the benefit of the British trader.
SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL:    It would be rather interesting to know how long this gentleman who experienced all these dirfIculties had been in Japan.MR. CLAUSON:    He had been in Japan for a year.SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL:    What you say is entirely foreign to my experience and the experience of the people I have.out there.   We find Japan a most extraordinarily efficient country, and if we are going to under-estimate their efficiency we are making a sad mistake.MR. LINDSAY:    May I ask what extent of Japanese holding there Is in the   factories in Hong-Kong?MR. CLAUSON:    There is practically no Japanese capital in Hong-Kong.SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.SIR ERNEST GLOVER:    I am afraid I have very little to report to-day.   There is practically no change in the market generally.    Statistically there is a slight improvement in the index number of freights,-, but in actual experience I cannot say that one can see that&apos;, there is any improvement anywhere.So far as outv/ard business is concerned, ooal rates have remained at a dead level for the last month or so, with a tendency to sag especially to the Mediterranean.    In general cargo outwards 1 do not hear of any improvement at all.    So far as homeward grain chartering is concerned, Russia has apparently retired from the market altogether for the present, and the result has been that a number of ships that went out to the Mediterranean expecting to load in the Black Sea have had to come back in ballast.   A large business is continuing from the Argentine, but at very low rates, merely sufficiently high to tempt modern large boats to go out in ballast rather than lie up.from America and Canada grain is practically a dead letter.   Prom Cuba there has only been a very small business passing in sugar.    In the East generally markets remain practically dead.    In Australia there has been a certain amount of chartering for wheat.   There has been a slight reduction In rates, and that reduction has tended to bring charterers into the market.So far as shipbuilding is concerned, there are still no orders at all being placed for ocean steamers.    The record for the month as far as I know is a couple of small passenger and cargo coasters.    I was noticing the comparison between the shipbuilding statistics for the first quarter of 1931 compared with 1930,    In round figures, the gross tonnage of the   shipbuilding  in the United Kingdom in the first quarter of 1951 was 43% of the corresponding figure for 1930 and abroad 79%, showing a total of 61% of last year&apos;s quantity of building in the world.   The ships launched during the period show almost Identically the same figures - 42 :&amp; in the United Kingdom, 82$ abroad, and 61$ total.    The ships commenced show a remarkable drop.    The figure in the United kingdom is 7^&apos;, abroad 49$, showing a total of 28%,    The laid up tonnage practically remains the same.    There Is no reduction to record at all.
i 9, 0      \iI will put in the usual statistics.-^CHAIRMAN:    Is there any reason that you Know showing why the Russian business came to an end?SIR ERNEST GLOVER:    It is difficult to explain anything Russian.    It came with a big rush last year, and the general expectation was that when, they stopped for the Winter it was probably because of climatic reasons and difficulty of transport, and that when they got into the Spring and roads became hard and there was no longer any snow or mud, export would be resumed.   But it simply does not come.    And of course one does not get any proper information about what is going on in Russia as one does in other countries.IRON AMD STEEL.MR. T. CHaDWICK:    The production of iron   and steel castings remains in a very depressed state, and probably it is felt most in the shipbuilding centres.    If one takes the whole of Scotland there are 42*19 per cent, unemployed.    If one takes the areas where shipbuilding is chiefly done, i.e., in and around the Clyde, the percentage of persons unemployed is somewhere near 50$.    On the North East Coast the percentage of unemployed in this trade is 37.52$.    The position in Lancashire in the heavy engineering trade is that there are 29.2$ unemployed the.ro,    In the southern area it is not quite so bad the amount of unemployment being 23.88$.    Taking the position generally throughout the whole of Scotland, Ireland and Wales the figures show that there are 33.13$ unemployed in this particular trade.I have a statement which has come from the National Light Castings Ironfoundors1 Federation dealing with the question of the light castings trade as it affects the whole of England and Scotland.    They state that the falling off in the export trade in that class of goods has been very considerable for a period of four or five years - the tonnage in this class of goods between 1929 and 1930 has fallen by 39$,    They also point to the position with regard to the production of baths and state that 7,000 baths are imported into this country per month, i.e., 84,000 per annum,    according to their statement, these are largely imported from Germany, France and Czechoslovakia.   They also go on to state that a factory is being built in Germany which is capable of producing 100,000 baths per annum.    They say that when this factory gets going, which is being built by The Standard Sanitary Company of New York, which is combined with the National Radiator Company, the light castings trade of this country will be in a very precarious position.They also state with regard to other classes of goods, rainwater and soil pipes, in certain markets such as Norway, Sweden, Holland, Egypt and the i mediterranean Ports, India and South Africa, our percentage reduction in export is 36.3;% as between 1928 and 1930.Is*See page 29.
0 $ 0 XI will hand in the usual statement-^, and also this statement that comes from the National Light Castings Iron-founders&apos; Federation.MR. WALMSLEY: Can Mr. Ghadwick explain why the factory he refers to should be established in Germany rather than in one of the other Continental countries where wage levels are very much lower than in Germany? The competition should not be eo formidable from Germany as it would be, say, from Belgium or Czechoslovakia, as labour costs in Germany are very much nearer to our own than is the case with any of the other continental manufacturing countries.MR. CHADWICE:    The statement is that this New York firmmade investigations in other continental countries and decided to build the factory in Germany.RAILWAYS.SIR RALPH WEDGWOOD:    I am sorry to say the decline in railway receipts continues uninterrupted.    It is a little difficult to make comparisons for the month of May because of the Incidence of Whitsuntide this year - Whitsuntide was a fortnight later last year - but such as they are the figures show there is an increase in passenger business.    That is no doubt entirely accounted for by the incidence of the Whitsuntide holdiays.    The increase amounts to 4-jb- per cent. In merchandise the receipts show a falling off of 17-k%, while the tonnagef snows a decrease of 20%,    The decrease in tonnage affects mostly the lower class commodities.    Dividing them by classes, the highest class show a decrease of 16^fo on tonnage, and the lower class a decrease of 23%,In coal the receipts show a decrease of 11^ and tonnagetf a decrease of 13.2^ while the shipment of coal shows a decrease of 29 per cent, in tonnage.*-fAs I have said, all these figures are very much affected by the Whitsuntide holidays, but they do not differ very materially from the general decline through the whole of the 22 weeks to the end of May, in which, merchandise is down by 14f$, and coal and coke is down by &amp;^%,   One of the trades which was doing well but which has now begun to show signs of a decline is the fish trade.    The fish trade had been increasing pretty substantially, at any rate for the larger ports, up till recently.    Now I hear that ships are being laid up at Grimsby, and a decline in the landings has begun.Taking the receipts of the railway companies as a whole for the 22 weeks ending May 31st, there has been a decline of 9^&apos;, or  6,750,000.    I &quot;think perhaps that indicates a worse position than actually exists.    I have reason to believe that concurrently there have been very considerable economies effected, so that it is impossible to say how far they willpage 22*      -fc-K-processes page 23*   jFor    three railways only (L.N.E.,L.M,S.and G.W.)&apos;or the three railways mentioned above,    -af This figure relates onlyto the L.N.E. and L.W.S. Railways,
succeed in wiping out that fall in receipts.    In the case of the railway shops,  short time is being worked to the extent of 70 per cent., but It is not in that direction particularly that the economies I am speaking of are being made; it is much more in the mechanisation of the Industry, the substitution of power, plant and machinery generally for hand labour processes.In other countries the dec ease Is very much the same, or Is even greater than in this country.   That is true both of Germany and of America.   Also In other countries generally the question of charges, rates and fares is giving rise to a good deal of consideration and some experiments at the present time,    It is interesting to know that in America some of the western companies in order to meet the heavy loss in traffic which they are experiencing owing to transference to the roads have experimented with a sweeping reduction of their fares.   Day coach fares have been reduced on many of the western lines in America from 1-Jd. per mile to Id. per mile, but they have found the change a disastrous one, and they have made haste to come back to the old level again.    They have found, rather to their surprise, that the reduced fare did not Increase the traffic, and that they were left with a very heavy loss of revenue, so heavy that they had, as I say, to retrace their steps rapidly.In other countries they have gone rather the other way.    In Germany there has been a tendency to raise the level of fares.    In France there has been a tendency of the same nature.    But there seems to be very considerable doubt in the minds of the railways all over the world as to whether the best remedy Is to raise the fares and charges, or to lower them, and in this country we are &quot;staying put.&quot;SHIPBUILDING.SIR JAMES LITHGOW:    On,the general question I have not been able  to discover any sign, either national or international, which would indicate any pr.spect of an early improvement of British trading conditions.With regard to shipbuilding, my attention has been drawn in the Minutes?? of the last meeting to a statement made by Mr. Barron criticising the methods used by employers in general, and by the Shipbuilding Employers1 Federation in particular, to bring home to all concerned the vital necessity for the taking of steps to put Britain In a better position to take advantage of any trade revival which may come about.On the general questic-n I should like to say that I disagree not only with what iwr. Sarron said, but with the way in which he said it.    I submit that the industrial outlook In Britain is far too grave to-day for the making of flippant references to the expressions of carefully considered views by those who, from experience and training, are qualified to have a real appreciation of the situation, and whose repeated warnings can only be disregarded at our peril,I venture to think that the present parlous position of British industry and certain sections of British Government finance are in the main due to the complete disregard by the British public of such warnings, and their failure to appreciate the steadily worsening competitive position of British*See pages 11 &amp; 12 of a.C.223 (taay, 1931).-12-
industry over the last decade.    For my part. I resigned my former personal membership of this Council because of the offhand way in which grave warnings of our serious position were received,healing specially with the so-called pamphlet ispued by the Shipbuilding Ximployers&apos; federation to which rtr. Barron took exception, please allow me to say that although I load no part in the preparation of this document I Avish to associate myself most definitely with every statement made in it.With regard to the method of presenting these statements, let me explain that as the document itself bears out the agreement which regulates the relationship between the Employers and the Unions in the shipbuilding industry provides that either side may put proposals before the other for an alteration in the conditions of employment.    The agreement further provides that before specific proposals are made in regard to wages a preliminary conference is held at which the situation of the industry is reviewed.    The usual procedure, which was adopted in the present instance, was for the Employers who were making the application to place before the representatives of the unions the relevant facts of the situation derived from their knowledge of the industry.I wish to emphasise that the invariable practice is to keep such statements confidential until they are given in the first instance to the representatives of the Unions in conference.    The Employers are always ready to continue to regard the proceedings as confidential so long as the unions may consider that any good purpose can be  served thereby.On the other hand, both sides have equal access to the Shorthand dotes of the Conference, and in practice either side can get or reproduce as many copies of the statements made by the other side as they may desire for the information of their own members.    where the statement has been made by the Employers, ronsoed copies are usually availacle, and these are as a matter of courtesy supplied to the Union representatives who desire to have them.    In the present instance, after tne Conference some of the union representatives intimated that they would like  to have for the use of tneir members such a number of copies of the statement that they could only be made available by printing, and it was from certain of the Union representatives that the  suggestion came to print the Employers&apos; statement; hence the pamphlet form to which tier. Barron takes exception.x;o attempt whatsoever was made by the Employers&apos;  federation to circulate this pamphlet to the workmen represented by the irade Unions at the Conference, and any distribution by the unions to their members was entirely at the individual Union&apos;s own initiative.    The unions were merely furnished with such number of copies as they requested lor their own purposes.ivir. darron&apos;s Union asked for and received a l..rge:r number of copies than ail the other Unions put together.I should like, Sir,  that these comments should be put in the same form as inr. Barron&apos;s statement.ClkilRfeiAjH:    I understand that you have written to the President on this.
i\SIR JAMES LITHGOW:    Yes, but I thought that seeing that Mr. Barron&apos;s statement had appeared in the Minutes it was really essential that the matter should be given its proper perspective and that a statement of the explanation of the situation should appear in the same way.     Hence my statement to-day.CHAIRMAN:    Your paper will, of course, appear in the same way as Mr. Barren&apos;s speech appeared.      Is there any other point?SIR JAMES LITHGOW:    I have nothing to add to what Sir Ernest Glover has said about shipbuilding.COTTON.MR. LENSOX B. LEE:    The conditions in the raw cotton market which obtained in April continued into May and, influenced largely by the surplus stock, estimated at 8,000,000 - 9,000,000 bales, which will have to be carried over at the end of August, prices have fluctuated at low levels.     Middling American on the spot at Liverpool was quoted on the last business day of the month at 4.80d., compared with 5,46d. on May 1st.      Weakness in the Egyptian Section was, however, less prominent, but even here a decline occurred.     The closing price for fully good fair Sakellaridis was 7.80d., and this compares with 3,50d, on May 9th.As a result of the conditions in the raw cotton market and the paucity of demand for yarns from manufacturers business in the Spi nning section has been far from satisfactory.     More mills are reported to have been closed whilst those which continue work are only engaged at unprofitable prices.The Piece Goods Section of the trade has continued depressed. The finishing trades have maintained output at about the level of the previous month, and receipts and deliveries of cloth were slightly better^The position in India is not materially different from what it was a month ago.      In Cawnpore riots have caused serious interference, and frustrated the recent efforts of dealers to commence business as the figures of imports into Bombay show.Imports of packages of all classes of piece goods and yarns into Bombay from the United Kingdom were in 1929 48,000, in 1930 42,000, and in 1931 11,000.      Imports from Japan were In 1929 38,000, in 1930 42,000, and in 1931 20,000.There is still no sign of any improvement from China, and until there is a substantial rise in the rate of exchange prospects must remain poor.Of the Near and Middle Eastern Markets, competition still persists in Egypt from Italy, Czechoslovakia and Prance. Baghdad has shown considerable improvement.     Russian competition in Persia is preventing business with that market   whilst, with the arrival a few weeks ago of Japanese goods in Constantinople, business for this market has practically ceased.     South America 1b far below the normal, and the general situation in Brazil does not encourage optimis.m and, at present, the import of textiles is at a standstill.
COAL.MR. BSNTON JONES:    The output of the whole   country up to the 83rd May this year is if million tons, which is at the rate of 831 million tons per annum.   Up to the corresponding date last year the output was 105^ million tons, which Is at the rate of 864 million tons per annum:&quot;&quot;     If the production of coal throughout the year continues at the same rate as it has done so far in relation to the first five months of 1930,  the coal output of the country will be 33 million tons less than it was in 1930, i.e., a drop of 18-1$*&quot;&apos;.The total export for the whole of the country up bo the end of April is 14 million tons which is at the rate of 42 million tons per annum.   Up to the corresponding date last year the tonnage exported was 19-g- million tons, or at the rate of 58^ million tons per annum.-&quot;- Thus, if the export tra.de continues at the same rate the rest of this year as it has done during the first four months, the export trade will be 16-^ million tons less than it was last year, i.e., a 28 per cent drop the Central Council under the Coal Mines Act scheme, in fixing allocations for each district for the July-September quarter   possibly members of the Council will be aware of the machinery and the methods which are followed, the allocation being fixed for each district once a quarter   assumed that the demand for the quarter July-September would be between 4$ and 5$ less than it was for the corresponding quarter of 1930.A somewhat difficult position arises out of stocks. Although under the Act the regulation of production should prevent unnecessary accumulation of stocks, it will only be effective in this direction if the deman.&apos;. for every class of ooal varies at the same rate as the total demand.    That is an ideal situation which in fact can never arise.   At the present time the demand for industrial fuel has fallen to a greater extent than the demand for other classes of fuel, and for this reason the mines find it difficult to dispose of the small coal, which is the class of coal mostly used In industry.The demand for coke is also low in consequence of  the small make of pig-iron,  and this accentuates the difficulty of disposing of small coal which ordinarily is used in the manufacture of the coke.*Ho te by Mijqgs ^Department: -It should be borne in mind that there was an extensive stoppage in South Wales at the beginning of this year and that during the latter part of 1930 output and exports figures fell off from those for the first part (so that the actual figures for the whole year were In fact, output 244 million tons and exports- 55 million tons).    If allowance is made for these factors the presumptive drop in output for the whole of 1931 may be estimated at 10,7$ and that in exports at 25$.
Apart from the export position an improved demand depends upon the general industrial situation, and in this direction there is at present no sign of any immediate  improvement. Actually during the last few weeks the production of coal has remained at a fairly steady figure.    It does not appear to he falling, but there is no sign of any Improvement.IRON AND STEEL.MR. WALMSLEY:    Continental prices - somewhat like the rain   are constantly falling.    There seems to be no bottom to the continental figures.     The report which I will hand* in gives somo interesting comparisons.   For steel bars in September 1929 the continental price was  5.12s.Sd. per ton f.o0b. Antwerp.   In January 19 31 it had fallen to  3.19.6d., and the last figures we have at the end of May or beginning of June are  3e8s.0d.    The price for steel joists in the corresponding periods were  5.  s. 6d. in September 1929,  3.12s.0d. in January of this year, and  3. 5s.Od. at the beginning of this month.    Those are the lowest prices on record for steel bars and steel joists.    There are similar falls in other classes of material, but I have just given those as typical, and as representing the most important classes of finished steel which are importod from the continent.    It is admitted that those figures are well below the cost of production in the countries of origin, balanced, of course, to some extent by the higher prices they obtain in their own countries there is no sign at all of any improvement in our own trade either for home consumption or for export.    The production figures in this country were a little better in way than in April, both for pig-iron and steel, but the imports and exports make a very much worse showing.    In May the imports of iron and steel were 227,800 tons, and the exports 167,500 tons. That Is the biggest excess :of Imports over exports that I have ever known, except in times of strikes or stoppages.    The imports show a considerable increase of about 30,000 tons over April, and the exports show a decrease of about 20,000  tons as oompared;&apos;with April.The general position as regards world trade is indicated if I give you certain figures with regard to steel rails,    The normal yearly requirements of foreign countries where rails are not produced may be taken at something like 800,000 tons per annum.    The total tonnage sold to those covmtries since the 1st October, 1930,  to the end of May, a period of eight months, was only 122,000 tons, which is at the rate of 183,000 tons per annum, or less than 25^ of what we consider the normal world requirements of rails.CHAIRMAN:    Does your last point mean that they are letting the machine run down?MR. WALMSLEY?    Yes, to a very large extent.CHAIRMAN:    You can only go on doing that for a limited time?-:-lSee page 48.-IS
o &quot;1o iMR. &quot;VALMSLEY:    For a time.   How limited or unlimited it may be I am not prepared to say.    It has gone on already much longer than we should have expected.CHAIRMAN:    I suppose in the normal way they would expect to renew a certain amount definitely each year?MR, WALMSLEY:    Oh, yes.    And of course a certain amount of extension goes on every year in these undeveloped countries. All that is now, of course, in suspense.    With regard to rails we are just repeating what happened during the war. For a period of about five years all extensions and* renewals were out down to an absolute minimum.   We are repeating that, and it may go on for another two or three years.AUSTRALIA.SIR FREDERICK YOUNG:    I think it will be sufficient if I hand in the cabled report&quot;&quot;&apos; whioh deals in the main with various exports from Australia which on the whole are very satisfactory, stimulated to some extent by the exchange position, and also by the seasonal productivity of Australia which is very satisfactory, the rainfall up to date being particularly good.    From that point of view the prospects are very satisfactory.   .INDIA.MR. H.A.F. LINDSAY:    The trade statistics for the year ending March 1931 have now been received in detail, and they show a drop in imports of 30.5^ over the previous year, and in exports &apos;bf 29.2^.    They are approximately the same, but the fall in Imports represents a fall in quantities rather than-in price, and the fall in exports represents a fall in price rather than in quantities.With regard to the prices, I made a survey of the effect on our staple exports of the slump in the London market during the three months January, February and March, and I found chat during those three months there has not been on the whole a fall.    If anything,  there has been a very slight recovery.    i checked that against the index numbers of prices received from Calcutta, and I found there too the same effect is noticeable. Taking the index number series as based on the prices of July 1914 for all commodities equal to 100, we had at the beginning of 1931 fallen below pre-war for our average figure was In January 1931,    98,    in February 1931 it was 99, and in Marsh 1931 100.    So that we have struggled with some difficulty up to the level of July 1914.The Interesting point is that that slight recovery has taken place almost equally over all the different classes of goods included   in the calculation.    T --i-t is to say, oerealo, pulses, sugar,  tea, oil seeds, vegetable oils, raw jute, jute manufactures, raw cotton, cotton manufactures, metals, timber, hides and skins - the whole range of our staple products.-x-Soe page 49.
COTTON.MR. LENNOX LEI was quoting of the slump in American cotton. I have made a comparison between the prices of American Middling and No.l Pine Oomrah as a typical Indian cotton, and I see some rather interesting results.     If you take August 1929 as possibly the beginning of the slump, between August 1929 and to-day American Middling has fallen by 6d., whereas the Indian cotton has only fallen by 4^d.     If you take the middle point in that fall, viz., August 1930,  you get a still more striking comparison.     Prom that point to to-day American Middling has fallen by 2^d. and Indian cotton by ^d. only.     That, I think, is due not only to the excess of American by comparison with Indian cotton, but I think to the improved quality of Indian cotton in comparison with the quality of American,     We are now selling more cotton than we have done for some time past in spite of the very full American crop.In regard to cotton piece goods, I have received a very interesting letter and statement from the Director-General of the Commercial Intelligence Department at Calcutta, which I propose to put in in full, to be abstracted or reproduced in full as you liice in the Minutes.*     The letter encloses a statement of despatches of cotton piece goods by rail from the main ports weeii by week, that is to say, the up-country deliveries, showing the extent to which cotton piece goods both foreign and Indian are passing into consumption.     The statement begins at the beginning of January and ends at the middle of April.     In the summary it shows that the despatches of non-Indian imported cotton piece goods have advanced from 514 tons   a week up to over 1,000 tons, and of Indian from 2,140 tons to 2,690 tons,  so that during those few weeks there has been certainly an improvement in up-country deliveries.        \1 Of course, I do not guarantee what is going to happen to the piece goods when they arrive up-country, but it is a hopeful sign anyway that they are going up and are not being detained at the port for re-export.In the covering letter to this statement there is rather an interesting paragraph on the progress, or rather lack of progress,  in the formation of the Company for the re-export of non-Indian goods.     There is also a statement comparing the prices of British and Japanese imported goods of which I do not need to give particulars except to say that they warrant a comparison with the relative imports of grey, white and coloured goods from England and Japan.     Curiously enough, in the grey goods where this country has held its own in the matter of prices with Japan, it seems to have lost most ground. In the white and the coloured goods, where Japanese quotations are all along the line lower than the Lancashire quotations, Lancashire has more or less held its own.     In that connection it is interesting to note that -the falling off in the import of cotton piece goods into India as compared with pre-war has been much more serious in the grey goods than in the white and coloured.     That, of course, has been a tendency which hasThe report is reproduced see page 51.
operated very much in favour of this country.     The statistics are something like this.     Pre-war the total imports of grey goods were 1,330 million yards, hut the 1,000 million yards has now dropped out and the imports are now only 360 million yards.     But the trade in white goods has only gone down from 654 million to 270 million yards, and in coloured goods from 631 million to 245 million yards.      There is a very much slighter falling off in the case of white and coloured goods than in the case of grey goods of which the British proportion is less.CHAIRMAN:   Is that great deficiency in grey goods being supplied from Indian mills?MR. LINDSAY:   Very largely from the Indian mills. According to the latest statement we have had,  there are 27 Ahmadabad mills which are wording night and day, and I think 25 Bombay mills which are working night and day.CHAIRMAN:   Do they turn out the goods cheaper than the goods sold from England?MR. LINDSAY: They turn them out at the comparative rate which must take into account the. rather high duties which now exist on imported goods.- In the letter which I am putting in the progress of the Indian mills is not entirely essential to the boycott. It is due also to the fact that as a result of economic conditions the demand is falling from the finer to the coarser goods, and also the tariff has to be taicen into account.CHAIRMAN:    Has the re-export society that you referred to yet been formed?MR. LINDSAY:   The letter says it has not been formed, but as a matter of fact I think from a telegram since received it has now been formed, but it does not seem to be operating very actively.    In fact, I think the paid up capital is something-very small, about 5 lakhs of rupees, which, of course, would not go anywhere in a scheme of that sort.EMPLOYMENT.MR. JOHN HILTON (Ministry of Labour):    I should in the ordinary way have compared the 27th April with the 25th May, but the 25th May was a Bank Holiday and therefore I havejonly the figures for the 18th May prior to the Vhitsun holidays, and the 1st June after the &quot;&quot;/whitsun holidays.     In that 5-week period, unemployment w&amp;s increasing between the 27th April and the llth May,  that is the first fortnight of the period,  and then in the following week, i.e.  just before V/whitsun, there was a marked improvement.     Then after Yhitsun there came a very heavy rise in the unemployment figures, due almost entirely to the extension of the Whitsun holidays.     So that almost entirely owing to that factor the numbers on the register at 1st June were 2,630,000 as compared with the figure on the 27th April of 2,520,000.      That means a net increase between the two dates of nearly 110,000 workpeople unemployed.
You will see how largely that is influenced by Whitsun considerations when I say that there was between those two dates In that 5-woek period, a decrease of 2,000 in the numbers wholly unemployed, and there was an increase of 112,000 in the numbers temporarily stopped.     The Increase was largely due to those extensions of the Whitsun holidays in the North-eastern, North-western and Midland Division, that is, in the central area of England,There is nothing very remarkable about the figures of men, women and juveniles when examined.     The number of men on the Register Increased by 77,000, the women by 43,000, while the juveniles decreased by 10,000,As regards the geographical distribution of the increase in unemployment in the London, South-eastern and South-western Division there was a fall during the month of 11,000,As regards the industries affected during the four-week period 27th April to 18th May, which Is the only period for which I have industrial figures, employment deolined slightly in coal mining, in general and marine engineering, shipbuilding and ship repairing, and in the wool textile industry.     There was a further seasonal Improvement in the building trade and the distributive trades.     An Increase of this kind took plaoe last year, but it was almost absorbed by the upward tendenoy of unemployment which persisted throughout 1929 e     This year is rather different from this point of view.     The unemployment figures were falling from a very much higher level during February, Maroh and April, and then they took an upward turn.     As regards the total number of insured persons who are in unemployment, aooording to our calculation at 18th May they are estimated provisionally to be 24,000 more than at 27th April, and about 464,000 less than the year previous.WOOL.Alderman M. F. TITTERINGTON:    During the past few weeks the wool-textile industry has again been affeoted by a loss of confidence.    The demand for fully-manufactured goods has been disappointing, and the continued weakness in prices has been an unfavourable faotor.    Sales of tops, yarns, and pieoe goods have had to be made at unprofitable rates,     Values of fine tops are still appreciably above the lowest point touched in January, but medium and coarse crossbred tops are approaching very near to the bottom.The export trade is very depressed, and our shipments of woollen and worsted tissues are much below normal.A strike in the French textile Industry on May 18th has caused production in that country to be virtually suspended.   Up to the present no appreciable benefit has boon felt by British producers.As I indicated a month ago-:;-, the question of wages in our own wool-textile industry has been under discussion, and last-::-See Minutes for May (A.0,  -223 p.21).
SIweek a mass meeting of employers decided to enforce reductions in two stages which are equivalent to a cut of 14*6% in wages,, These proposals have not been forwarded as yet to the constituent Trade Union,,      It is merely a Press report to which I am referring.At our last meeting Mr. Varley asked a question with regard to the trade in woollen and worsted goods with Canada and the United States.-::-     From what I can gather, there are no signs of improvement in either market, and the new Canadian tariff has had a very adverse effect.     Recent exports to both countries have been unusually small.      During the first four months of the year we only sent 3,679,000 square yards of woollen and worsted tissues to Canada,  compared with 6,216,000 square yards in the corresponding period of 1930,  and 3,749,000 square yards in 1929. These exports represented 12 per cent, of the total exports of tissues In 1931, compared with 16 per cent, two years ago.Exports to the United States during the first four months of this year have been only 1,334,000 square yards, compared with 3,498,000 square yards last year and 5,024,000 square yards in 1929.      They represented a little over 4% of the total exports, compared with 9c/o a couple of years ago.     Putting it in general terms, our exports to Canada were under 4,000,000 square yards, or less than half what they were two years ago, and our exports to the United States were 1-500,000 square yards, or less than one-third what they were two years ago.    Both markets, therefore, have shown a larger decline than the general run of overseas markets.I will put in the usual particulars,regarding prices, turnover,  employment, earnings, and exports.*--::- I think one can generally summarise the position by saying the general outlook is extremely bad, and some firms are being more or less formally pressed at this stage by the banks, and, generally speaking, the optimism which followed the sharp rise of prices in February and March has just about disappeared.The Proceedings Terminated.BOOTS AND SHOES.MR.

\MR. OHADwIGK   handed in the &apos;  olio wling statement -Extracts from the shorthand notes^oi  conference between Joint, Light Metal Trade Unicms and the National Light Ojajyings Tronfounders Federation respecting their claim for a reduction in wa%es, May,  1931.yers&apos; Case.        The reduction in the volume of trade is perhaps due to two main causes which we might sub-divide.In the first place, as we are all aware,  there has been a very considerable and deep depression in ?rorld trade -which has n-turally reacted on the conditions of trade in Great Britain.    In the second ;;lace,  there has been over the last twelve months a falling off in the housing schemes which are built under the Government Housing Acts and subsidised by the public funds.    It is not surprising to find that there has been this diminution in the housing schemes, because for some years houses were built at a very rapid rate,  and a substantial part,  if not all of the leeway with which the country was faced at the end of the war has been overtaken.With regard to low prices,  that in a way naturally follows fro\;; the fact that the supply at the moment exceeds the demand for light castings products.Now, also due to world depression and other factors Great Britain and the light castings manufacturers have lost very substantially in their export market.    The amount of available production from the home foundries, if these are to b e kept at reasonably full capacity, has to find an outlet in the markets of the y/orid, because the output cannot be taken up in Great Britain itself,  and formerly the light castings industry had a very large export trade.      You can appreciate what effect such a substantial failing away in the export trade,  as we have witnessed in the past four or five-years, has had on the condition of the home market, because the surplus production formerly taken up by the export markets has now lost that outlet and is being concentrated on the home market, with the very serious results which we are endeavouring to deal with to-day.Countries which formerly served-as our foreign markets have in many cases established foundries in their own countries and have s tarted to meet their own requirements under the protection of tariff walls which make it impossible for Great Britain to put in any goods against theirs.Markets. s/ith r egard to the home market, and esx)ecially in one particular class of manufacture, namely baths,  re 8 re not only confronted with the shutting off of our export markets, but with a very very grave menace in the form of imports from France and Germany, particularly Germany, including a certain number from Czechoslovakia.The baths imported here in the last four or five years amount to 7,000 per month,  or 84,000 per annum.    You will, I think, appreciate what that means when you realise that oven when housing schemes were in their heyday the number of such houses erected was somewhere about 200,000 per annum. I might mention that the 84,000 represents the imports from
Germany, Prance, Czechoslovakia, etc. without reckoning what the Standard Sanitary Company of New York may do in the future by way of importing into this country.    I do not know whether it is news to you or not, but the Standard Sanitary Company of New York, which is combined with the National -Radiator Company which does a substantial business in this country, two or three years ago investigated conditions in this country for the setting up of a bath plant.    They did the same on the Continent, and eventually decided, for reasons which they considered good and sufficient, to establish their factory in Germany*    They have built a factory which is capable of a production of 100,000 baths per annum, and as I have stated, the figures of 84,000 before given is exclusive of what we may expect to have by way of imports of the Standard Sanitary Company&apos;s baths,v/ith regard to what we ourselves have done, we have reduced prices again and again in order to maintain our connection in this country and abroad.    The reductions have taken place, as I have said, in all classes of goods, although in some classes it has been necessary to reduce more drastically than in others.    Unfortunately, we still find that there are founders, manufacturers in this country and abroad, who are willing to quote and actually are quoting to-day substantially lower prices, although the levels to which our own quotations have fallen represent, not only no profit, but in many cases a ten to fifteen per cent loss on the present-oduct.    We recognise that part of this competition is needless and indeed senseless, and that it is altogether unnecessary as it is occurring to a considerable extent among ourselves as British Manufacturers.     Accordingly, those manufacturers who were hitherto associated and are associated to-day in the Federation and formerly in the N.L.C.A. , started about two years ago and have been endeavouring ever since and are still endeavouring to bring about an organisation of the industry which will bring every important manufacturer of light castings goods into association to stop this ruinous internal competition. . We have made certain progress and have established another Association known as the British Ironf ounders&apos; Association, but unfortunately we still find in some instances that thcs e firms which refused to work in the N.L.C.A., and co-operate v/ith it in prices are still standing aloof from the new movement.      It was the extension of those firms and the growing up of new ones that brought the N.L.C.A.,  to an end, and nothing is more certain than that if we are unable to get into closer co-operation with these firms,  the existing association will not be able to function effectively,  even if able to maintain its existence.    It will certainly be unable to stabilise prices at an economic level.The unfortunate position is, tha&quot;t* prices in many cases have now fallen and have become stabilised at so low a level, that e/en if thoroughly organised, it will be difficult to jump our prices suddenly to a reasonably economic level.    Quite recently,  indeed within the last month, Mr. Greenwood the Minister of Health, addressed a letter to Major Hills,  the Chairman of the Committee set up some years ago to survey the prices of building materials, directing Major Hills&apos;s attention to the fact that the prices of houses built under Government subsidy are not falling in ratio with the fall in the cost of raw materials, and he asks Major Hills and his Committee to investigate why that should be.    You can appreciate that if
we as manufacturers were thoroughly organised and were suddenly to raise our prices the necessary 20 per cent to bring these to an eoonomic level, we would he immediately faced with some communication, probably hot couched in friendly terms, from Mr. Greenwood er Major Hills, ashing us to justify our action. That is the unfortunate effect of prices having dropped to the low level at which they are teday.Take the case of   Baths?      0cmparing the years 1925 and 1929, because the figures for 1930 are not fully completed, although I may say they will probably be worse than fur 1929, our exports in tonnage to foreign countries have dropped by 43.3. per cent and our exports to what we call British Countries the Colonies and Dependencies, have dropped 39 per cent..    Notwithstanding that during these years 1925 to 1929 we have reduced cur export prices for baths by no less than 25 per cent,  in values they have drepped 41.67 per cent.In regard to other olasses of goods, rainwater and soil pipes, in certain markets such as Norway, Swoden, Holland, Egypt and the Mediterranean Ports, India and bouth Africa, our percentage reduction in export is 36.3 per cent, as between 1928 and 1930.i 1 1COLONIAL TRADE.Mr. 0LAUS0K handed in the following tablesBritish Malaya.Rubber   A table of comparative statistics for the period 1st January t^ 50th April is attached.Northern Rhodesia.The fellowing is a comparative table of mineral production.---	1930	1931  	Total to da1	&quot;.e in  			1930	1931J anuary February	103,541 107,845	70,940 61,164	103,541 211,388	70,940 132,104Uganda.The comparative returns for this territory are normally rendered In conjunction with those for henya.

CHEMICALS.DR. CLAYTON handed in the following reports-General.The general inference is that there is very little change in the industry and what there has been was at least in the wrong direction.   At least, the rumours of improvements in general trade conditions are not justified bj&apos; an examination of the records for the chemical industry during the last few weeks.Heavy Chemicals:Alkaline and Chlorine Products *Sales of alkali productc throughout the world during April showed a small decline, in comparison with those for March.   Trade at home was affected by the Easter holidays, and preliminary advices for May indicate no general improvement, , although a seasonal increase is usually evident in May.Demand for chlorine products at home during April compared very favourably with that last year, which was exceptionally low, and is on the same level as the average for 1970o   Results for May, however, have been adversely affected by a slackening in demand from the textile Industries. Shipments to export markets have improved, and compare favourably with those during the first quarter.Adds:There is no improvement to report.Fertilisers:Sulphate of Ammonia,The season for the consumption of sulphate of ammonia is now practically ended in most consuming countries, although the demand in some parts of the world will extend through June.     From a variety of causes, such as the low price of produce, the bad financial state of farmers,  and curtailment of the output of certain products, it is anticipated that the world consumption for the fertiliser year 19?0/3I will show a decrease as compared with the previous year.A possible exception to this is Spain, although recently, changes in Government, coupled with the rapid fall in the value of the Peseta, end a prolonged drought in some districts, adversely influenced the consumption.With regard to the United Kingdom, sales of sulphate of ammonia show a considerable decrease as compared with the previous fertiliser year.Some cargoes of synthetic nitrate of soda, purchased in the United States, have arrived in Europe, and production from this source will have to be reokoned with.in future.
Dyes-buffs .During the last month there has been a decline in deliveries of dyestuffs to the textile, calico printing and paper trades, while an increase is registered in deliveries to the leather, lake and paint manufacture, rubber and foodstuff trades.With regard to the textile industries&apos;  decline in consumption, certain improvements are also noticeable, the sales of direct cotton colours having been maintained, while there has been a distinct improvement in the sales of the faster type of vat colours.In the woollen trade, deliveries of the ordinary type of dyestuff show a distinct falling away, but sales of the fast type - Chrome Mordants - have maintained their old level.Indigo sales continue to be depressed,  and have now reached an abnormally low level, while in the cheaper class of dyestuffs - Sulphur Colours - there is a still further decline.Tar Products.No noteworthy changes appear to have taken place in the market for tar products as a whole, though a report of promising sales of refined tar has come to hand.Fine Chemicals:Representatives of fine chemical manufacturers report that while business during the past few weeks might have been expected to be quiet, the slackness in the home markets and the almost literal stagnation in the export trade are probably without precedent.SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.The following figures were handed in by SIR E.

HAMILTON sent the following report:-The monthly census of machinery activity taken for the week ending May 9th showed an average of 66,4^.    The usual seasonal activity during the month should show an improvement on the preceding month, but this year there has been a decline ofFor some considerable time employers have been hoping; that an improved demand for wool textiles would spring up and relieve them of the responsibility of re-opening, the wages question.   Unfortunately no such demand has come to ease the situation, and a meeting of Employers, comprising every section of the industry was, therefore, summoned for June 3rd. At that meeting the case for a general wages reduction was put by the Chairman of the Woollen and Worsted Trades Federation and supported by the statistics, of which I append a copy.    It was decided practically with unanimity to recomrend a revision of wages in the following manner:-1, A reduction of 5% on the basic rate,2. To adjust the cost of living bonus to the present figure,These reductions, amounting in all to 14.6%7 were to be Introduced in two instalments with an interval of 3 months.The recommendations are at present under consideration by the various trade organisations,  and as soon as their decisions are concluded a further general meeting will take place.Table showing levels of Wages Rates in the Wool textile Industry and in other main exporting Industries, Wholesale Prices and Cost of Living in the years 1924 to 1931 inclusive, together with Wool Wages Costs for those years.1913 s 100.Cost of living........Average of Wages Rates in other exportingIndustriec...........Wool Wagee Rates......Wholesale Prices......Wool Wages Costs ......1924.180156 201 1681925.1 1926.  1927 .1 1928.  1929.!175156 201 15?175156 201 146232168156 201 140232167156 201 138 232166155 801 1??*! 193115?155201/-JB2 109 232/210147154 182 106 210

The total on the registers of Employment Exchanges at 1st June was 2,629,971 as compared with 2,520,113 at 27th April,The net increase of 109,858 between those two dates was accounted for by a decrease of 2,037 in the numbers wholly unemployed,  and an increase of 111,895 in the numbers temporarily stopped.     The increase in the temporarily stopped was largely due to the extension of Whitsun holidays in the North Eastern, North Western and Midlands Divisions.The number of men on the Register increased by 77,147 and the number of women by 42,748, while the number of juveniles decressed by 10,037.

There was a further seasonal improvement in the building trade and the distributive trades.The total number of insured persons in employment at 18th May, 1931,  is estimated provisionally to be about 24.000 more than at 27th April but about 464,500 less than at 26th May, 193Q.

JELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.SIR HUGO HIRST writes that nothing has happened to change the outlook of the Electrical Industry, and his last review of the situation still holds good.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. POLLETT HOLT sent the following report:-Nothing of outstanding importance has occurred during the past month in the South American Countries to affect the diminishing volume of goods imported into those Countries from Great Britain and elsewhere.The low value of produce has fundamentally disturbed the financial position df the Nations and of producers and those dependent upon them, and expenditure by Governments and individuals must be on a much lower level than that to which those concerned have become improperly accustomed.The severedeprsciation In the gold value of the currencies in ilrgentina   Uruguay and Brazil, whilst making the payment of interest on foreign, obligations by Governments embarrassing, is forcing a lower standard of living upon the masses, and this is a disturbing factor.The reduction in the value of imports in some cases is remarkable, for instance those from the United States of America to Argentina for the first quarter of this year fell to  2 , 958,000from  7,181,000 in the same period of the previous year.The great British Public Utility Companies are suffering severely by the depreciation in exchanges.     Their purchases in Grlat Britain, which in the past have been of material assistance to trade, are being greatly curtailed and must so remain until exchanges become more normal,Argentina and Brazil are still in the hands of Provisional Governments, the outcome of Revolutions.     The members of the former are of high character and standing and are doing good work to straighten out affairs, and in spite of the circulation of mischievous rumours from the United States of America and elsewhere are likely to hold their own peacefully till the General Elections in November and possibly afterwards.      In Brazil Sir Otto Niemeyer is still studying conditions.      The country is very impoverished, and this is particularly noticeable In the North where poverty is producing a wave of crime, but no serious disturbance is expected.      The political position in Chi Is is not too comfortable.British traders and financial interests are fully alive to conditions, and being less temperamental than their competitors there is every prospect that they will emerge from this time of exceptional crisis with their high prestige well maintained and with improved prospects.
Jl 0 3RAILWAY TRAFFIC.SIR CYRIL HURCOMB sent the following report and tables:-During the four weeks ended 31st May, 1931, which included Whitsuntide, the railway traffic receipts of the four amalgamated companies&quot;&quot;&apos; were  929,000 less than in the corresponding period of 1930.

They are experiencing severe competition from European manufacturers.      They are anticipating a better home trade with little or no change in styles.In hosiery they report trade conditions to be slightly better.     The increased -price of wool has given stability to the market and increasing confidence in prices.      They do not anticipate however, that any very marked improvement can take place in the immediate future owing to the low spending pov/er of their markets.A certain amount of improvement is taking place in the building trade in the Leicester area due, partly, to improved weather conditions, and mainly to public expenditure on new schools Town Council houses and alterations to public buildings.Liverpool reports price movements in a downward direction in bacon, ham, lard, Danish butter, chilled and frozen beef.      On the other hand there has been some increase in price in New Zealand and Australian butter, Irish creamery butter, Canadian cheese and New Zealand lamb.The volume of ship-repairing carried out during the month does not show any improvement.Reports on the West African trade still emphasize the low values which the native producers are receiving for their commodities.The volume of production is being maintained in Palm kernels. The total imports of Kernels into all ports in this country since the beginning of the year is 51,670 tons, which is fractionally more than the volume imported during the same period in 1930.Ground nuts are also falling in price, and cocoa is fractionally lower   for the month.
No change of any moment has taken -place in the Lancashire Cotton Industry during the past four weeks.      The position is still dominated by the unsatisfactory state of affairs in India. The exports to that market, which is Lancashire1s most important outlet under normal conditions,is reduced to a fraction of what it was only comparatively recently.COAL.SIR W. RAINJJJ sent the following report :-In my last report,* I referred specially to the drop which had taken place in the limitation prices of Northumberland Small Coals.      Since then, the Ooliiery people have advanced the prices by 1/- per ton, so that the prices to-day are only l/6 below what they were before the reduction took place in May.The Market has continued in a very depressed condition, and much loss of time is occurring.     The result of the Swedish Railways Contract which was published a few days ago, is very disquieting. - 11,000 tons have come to this District, 9,000 tons of which are for Broomhill Steam Coals, the price at G-othenborg being 16/-.      Seeing that the limitation price of Broomhill is 12/- per ton f. o.b. , this only leaves 4/- for freight and Insurance, a rate at which I very much question if the Broomhill people will be able to charter.The other 2,000 tons were sold at 16/3 c.i.f. Halmstad, but there are other options.     However, no Coal in question is below 12/-   ;f.o,b. and the price for this order is even worse than that for Broomhill.55,000 tons of the Contract have gone to Scotland, at prices which are far below Colliery ideas.At the moment, there does not seen to be a ray of hope of any improvement.      We are feeling the full severity of foreign competition.     Added to this, there is the French situation. The French Miners are pressing the Government to help them by the introduction of Import Licences, etc.     The French Government up to now, has refused to take any such step, because it has been pointed out that in the first place, this will damage the position of the Dockers in the various French Ports, and secondly, it is necessary for the Manufacturers and other consumers to buy their raw materials in the cheapest possible Market.     There is little doubt, however, from a careful study of the French papers, particularly those devoted to Coals, that great pressure is being brought to bear upon the French Government.      In actual experience, the various public Utility Companies in France have received instructions to reduce their Import of Coals for the present, and to use French Coals. Several firms on the North-East coast, who are supplying the different Railways, have received instructions from one of the big Railways, to carry over part of their Contracts to next year, and just to-day (Monday, 8th^June) my firm has received a letter from our Agent in Paris, stating that another of the Railways, whom we supply, are seriously considering the question, owing to the French Industrial depression, of requesting that a portion of our Contract be carried forward to next year.*See Minutes for May (A.C.    223, p.4l).
SHIPBUILDING^There have &quot;been one or two enquiries on the North-East coast for new tonnage, hut nothing has come of them.     Shiprepairing remains very quiet indeed.      It is unfortunate to have to say-it, but even the optimists are becoming infected with the pessimism which has prevailed generally for so long a time.ENGINEER ING.MR. ROY/LAND sent tho following report:-Review of current conditions.It is almost unnecessary to state that no real signs of improvement are as yet evident in the figures for April. Production and foreign trade figures continue to be very depressed,     Indeed, it may well be said that the very bottom appears to be knocked out of foreign trade, particularly on the export side.     For instance, in regard to our heavy industries, April was the eighth consecutive month in which the imports of J.ron and steel have exceeded the exports, while never before in post-war years has the monthly tonnage of machinery exports been so low as in the opening months of the current year.There is one slight redeeming feature to be noticed,  in that the hitherto steady increase of unemployment has been at length arrested in March and April as regards the country taken as a whole, but unfortunately this has not been the case in engineering and the cognate industries, although the rate of increase in their unemployment levels has been diminished.It must be added that financial conditions and the state of the industry, as reflected in annual balance sheets and reports, continue to be very discouraging.     It is to be hoped that the latest reduction in Bank Rate to 2 jig, which was effected on May 14th last, may have ultimate beneficial results on trade and industrial conditions generally.     An important event during the past month has been the projected merger of six important textile machinery manufacturing companies in Lancashire.Analysis of machinery exports.As an illustration of the very serious collapse, referred to above, of our foreign trade, particularly in the exports of our basic heavy industries, we have taken the export tonnage of machinery for purposes of analysis and have, therefore, set out in a Tabled a summary statement of these exports in monthly totals in each of the years 1913,  1929, 1930 and to date in 1931, By taking the figures of tonnage for this purpose, we achieve a direct comparison of the volume of the current export trade with that of pre-war, quite irrespective of the fluctuations which have occurred in values during the interval.     The comparison is further important,  inasmuch as the 1913 total of exports was the highest yet attained,  the aggregate for the year being 689,389 tons.     A glance at the table shows that in 1929, which was almost our best post-war year, total exports amounted to 562,863 tons, equal only to 81,6% of the 1913 amount.     In the* Not reproduced,
- rfollowing year, 1930,  exports declined and amounted for the whole year to 481,345 tons or only 69.8$ of 1913 total.     The story becomes even more dismal in the current year,  as the average monthly export tonnage to the end of April represents only 29,175 tons,  and the cumulative total for the four months is 51.9/;., or barely more than half, of the amount exported in the corresponding period of 1913.     Thus it would already appear, even if conditions should not become any worse in the remaining months, that the total export tonnage for 1931 will only be about b0% of the 1913 level, and probably not more than 75% of last year&apos;s total.Engineering contracts.Appended will be found the usual list   giving particulars of the more important contracts recently placed with British firms and of schemes in contemplation.

The following are extractsfran the report and tables sent in by MR. VARLEY; -Wheat,  - The Market has declined about l/- per quarter during the month, owing to the near approach of the new crops in the U.S.A., and the deplorable financial conditions in exporting countries.Canada. - The enquiry into the marketing of grain had scarcely any effect upon the situation.    The weather has been too dry, but good rains in June will most likely produce a normal crop.U.S.A, - The Farm Board are said to have ceased supporting the market, and in endeavouring to transfer tneir holdings to firms in the trade caused rather heavy pressure to sell.    This may continue, as it is necessary to malce room for new wheat, which will begin harvesting this month.Russia. -   Not offering much wheat at present, but in spite of the late Spring great progress has been made v/i th sowing.    If good weather obtains further competition for the import wheat trade of Europe will be experienced.Australia. -   Good supplies still available, but not so much pressure to sell.India. -   Very little export trade arranged as the price is so low.Argentine. -   Continues steadily selling and meeting competition.Maize. - Very heavy crop harvested in the Argentine and it will be difficult to secure enough trade in Europe to absorb it. Price very low, and it seems a pity that Continental countries put heavy tariffs on the prevent their people getting cheap food for cattle and poultry.Barley. -     Good supplies still available, but less business owing to abundance of grass in the United Kingdom.Qiiis.&quot; -   Good supplies available at very low prices. Consumption in Europe unable to take care of the surplus owing to high tariffs.Killing Offalc    With abundance of grass prices have fallen away, and flour millers are not having quite as profitable a time.DRAPERY DEPARTMENTS,.Trade for current half-year to the 30th May,  shews approximately 10 per cent, decrease with the corresponding period, so that with reduced values the output of merchandise is maintained.- The present unemployment figures demonstrate the continued unsatisfactory state of the Cotton and Wool Industries, and undoubtedly   from manufacturer to retailer full energy is required and competitive value must obtain to secure business.Trade generally may be considered fairly satisfactory at the present time.COAL.Trade during May v/as much easier to work, owing to the necessary supplies under the Quota system being available.   Arrange-ments are being made to prevent shortage such as occurred during the latter part of February and March.

WALKER sent the following report:-Conditions generally in the Hosiery Trade are still far from good, and the reports from the various districts are as followss-Leicester.Trade conditions generally are slightly better and the increased prices in wool, which seem firmly established, have given more confidence.Underwear departments are still quiet and suffering from the effects of foreign competition to an increasing extent.The Fancy Outerwear Trade is slightly better for novelties, although the reward of enterprise in this section is still far short of what it should be normally.Export Trade has been quiet during the past month and the result of the increased duties imposed by the Colonies is being felt more and more,- INo great improvement is anticipated in the near future while spending power remains restricted,Nottingham.A slight improvement in trade generally is reported from Nottingham.The full fashioned silk hose section still continues active! and the children&apos;s socks trade continues good, whilst the demand! for cashmere half-hose is above normal for the time of the year,!)
1 i QAn improvement is noticed in the lighter weight of underwear, hut trade in the heavier lines is slow.     The demand for hathing costumes, particularly those made of wool, still remains brisk.Unfortunately the Shipping Trade continues to be quiet and below normal.Loughborough.It is reported that trade generally is slow, short time being worked in most sections, especially in Artificial Silk Hose.The depression is attributed to the continued heavy importation of foreign goods,Mansfield.It is reported that the general state of trade in this district is bad, the only movement is in the finer gauge class.Hawick.In common with other textiles this industry, both underwear and outerwear,  is feeling a prolonged and increasing reduction in demand, in consequence of which there is more and more idle machinery and short time.     While the demand in the Home Market, both underwear and outerwear, has been greatly reduced it has kept up wonderfully considering the state of trade generally, but the export demand has been very bad and very disappointing.     There is, however, at the moment slight signs of improvement in orders from the Home Market and from abroad,Hinckley.Very little change is reported in the conditions at Hinckley. Trade is still poor although a slight improvement in Specials, and Underwear,  is noticeable.MR. WALMSLEY handed in the following report additional to his statement at the meeting:-The two furnaces referred to in last month&apos;s report were duly restarted on the North -East Coast, but as one of Dorman Long&apos;s furnaces at South Bank Works has been blown out. the number of furnaces blowing at the end of the month (79; was only one more than at the end of the previous month.     There have been reductions in the price of South Staffordshire pig iron and Scottish pig iron but no official reduction has yet taken place in Cleveland pig iron and consumers are keeping off the market in the hope that prices will fall.     In endeavouring to sell t* Scottish consumers the Cleveland makers have to meet competition from the Midlands, the Continent and India,A great deal of prominence has fceen given to the complaints of the shipbuilders that the discrepancy between British and Continental prices is widening and that the price of Continental material is much lower than at the time the Rebate Scheme was adopted and they claim that British prices should be reduced in consequence.     What the shipbuilders do not appear to appreciate is first that the low price of Continental material is due to an appreciable extent to &quot;dumping&quot; (it is admitted in the Continental press that export prices involve a loss), and second, that the cost
of British material is kept up hy the stagnation of trade. A large maker of plates wrote under date 2nd June &quot;the volume of trade keeps diminishing *- last week we received orders for only 400 tons of plates, the week before 1,000 tons, and during the two preceding weeks 700 and 761 tons. If we worked two shifts we could roll in the one mill quite comfortably 1,750 tons and on top of this we have another big plate mill idle at ...... &quot;While the depression in trade is obviously the main cause of the very low Continental prices, it is possible that a desire to influence the quotas when the European Cartel regulations are revised is a contributing factor and this suggestion seems to be borne out by the fact that in spite of the poor demand two additional blast furnaces have been blown in in Belgium during the month of May.The shipbuilding industry shows no signs of improvement while the requirements of the automobile industry compare unfavourably with a year ago.     The export trade remains stagnant with the exception of Borne slight activity in the Canadian market.     No signs of a revival are evident from China, India and Australia which are usually good markets.May. 1931346,000 435,000Estimated Production, Pig IronSteely ..323,000 tons 397,000     &quot;Imports.

Department of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, India,,Camp Simla,    the 16th May,1931.My dear Lindsay,Will you please refer to your cable No.19763 of 8th May regarding the position of the Indian cotton textile industry vis-a-vis competition from abroad.2. On the enclosed sheet you will find graphs for:-(l) Indian Mill Production (2) Imports of Piecegoods(3) The total of mill-made piecegoods available forconsumption in India (4)    The long period trend showing the growth of Indianproduction.(5) The long period trend of imports of pieoegoods(These have been given by the small dotted lines, and the one whose equation introduces the seoond power of x is a much better fit than the other).(6) There is a curve A running through the total consumptiongraph and this I shall explain in more detail later.The trends have been worked out to the end of the financial year1929-30 and have been prolonged throughout the year 1930-31without taking the actuals of this last year into the calculation.-1-Report on the Indian Cotton Textile trade from Dr. D.B. Meek of the Department of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, India, to the Indian Trade Commissioner in London (kr .E A.P.Lindsay, C.I.E., C.B.E., I.C.S.) communicated by the latter to the Board of Trade Advisory Council  (June 11,1931).
122The inclusion of these actuals would not have had much effect on the trends beyond decreasing their slightly up\*rard tendency.    They appear to be straight lines and ae-tually in the case of the first approximation for imports the line of trend is straight as the graphs are drawn on semi logarithmic paper but the trends given by the second degree equation only appear to be straight lines because the time scale  (horizontal) Is so extended.    The lines are really portions of a parabola.7 . From the     line of Indian mill production and the long period trend you will see that the Indian mills have recently been producing cotton piecegoods at a rate considerably above what would be expected from the normal growth of the industry on past experience.    This excess of production is most marked from the middle of 1929 onward.    In January and February of 1970 the production fell off and in July and August there was again a considerable fall, but since November of 19^0 the mills have been busy and their production has risen considerably.    The figures for the last two months of February and Larch of 1921 are simply estimates based on the rate of progress from December to January.    The actual figures for February and iv^rch have not yet been received from the mills.    The two low periods of production in 1928 and 1929 were due to striken in the cotton mills. Here is an industry then which, during the last eighteen months, has displayed an activity well above the normal while almost all other industries in the world have been considerably depressed below their normal and while the same industry in most other countries has been working far below normal capacity.    The only conclusion possible is that the cotton mill industry in India has been doing well, not only relatively but actually.    The seasonal variations in the activity of the Indian cotton mills will be obvious.    From the graph you can also work out&apos;
&amp; t*, a.the percentage excess activity month by month.     During the 18 months ending January 19?1 there is no month in which the production fell below norraL4..    The    line showing the imports of piecegoods oscillated about the line of the normal trend of imports during 1988 and 1929 and the first few months of 1930 bl ng on the whole below the normal trend from the middle of 1929.    From. March of 1970 onwards to November, the imports of cotton piecegoods fell almost continuously by very large percentages.    In passing it may be noted that the boycott of imported piecegoods was instituted from the first week of March 19?0.    At the end of 1970 and during the first few months of 1951 there has been an upward tendency in imports of piecegoods.5. The heavy black line may be taken as the total of piecegoods for consumption in India,.    It is simply the production in India plus the imports minus exports and re-exports,  and as exports and re-exports are practically&quot; negligible it more or less represents the sum of manufactures in India and imports into India.    As the production from March rerained fairly constant for about five months and the imports fell considerably this curve of total for consumption also shows a decline right on from March 1930 to October 1970.6.    The curve A, which runs through this total produc-tion graph, has been obtained by dividing the index number of export prices by the index number of cotton piecegoods prices and multiplying the results by .85. The reason for multiplying by  .85 is simply to make this graph coincide with the total production graph at the point of September 1929, This particular, ratio has been plotted to represent some kind of measure of the purchasing power in India for cotton pieoegoods--
124It will be noticed that it has fallen very rapidly from September 1929 until January 19 31.   The inference from this is simply that prices for raw produce exported from India fell much more rapidly than the prices which had to be paid in India for cotton piecegoods.   This ratio oannot claim by any means to be an aocurate measure of the purchasing power for cotton piecegoods.   In fact it would be rather difficult to obtain such a measure.    The prices of raw products have fallen very considerably, as was mentioned in the Special Review of Trade prepared in January 1931, and as the ryot has oertain definite fixed cash payments to make, this leaves his balance for the purchase of such articles as cotton cloth reduced to a greater extent than would be expected from the fall in the price of his agricultural products alone. If we take the heavy black line as representing the goods consumed these fixed cash payments would help to explain the larger fall In the consumption of cotton piecegoods over the measure which we have taken as the ryot*s purchasing power for these goods.   Unless the relative prices of the ryot&apos;s produce and of cotton piecegoods change in such a manner as to make this ratio inorease there would not appear to be much hope of a great increase in the consumption of cotton piecegoods in India.   This has to be kept in mind if the figures of Indian mill production inclined one to a highly optimistic view of the future of the Indian cotton mill industry.7. On top of all this there has to be added the effect of the boycott movement, and the reduced purchasing power together with the boycott movement will in great measure explain the large fall in the consumption of cotton piecegoods.   You will see from the graph of imports that the fall in the purchasing power was beginning to have its effect even before the boycott movement was started, and
whether it was a coincide race or not the boycott movement certainly started at a time when it was likely to be most effective, namely,  just after five months during which the purchasing power of the ryot had been falling very rapidly.8. There must also be considered, with the two factors which I have already mentioned, the question of the effect of the import duties on the relative position of production in India and Imports of cotton piecegoods.   All three causes are oombined and I have found it impossible to separate one from the other.9. The graphs will give you a fairly clear idea of the present position of the Indian cotton textile industry in relation to competition from abroad.    I am also including statements which show the figures of production, of imports and separate details of the imports from various countries together with figures of the declared values under the main three heads of Grey, V/hite and Coloured, printed or dyed of these imported goods.   You will notice the fall which as taken place in prices, but,  as I have indicated above,  this fall is not so large as the fall which has- taken place in the price of agricultural produce.    So far as competition between the various countries and between them and India Is concerned the matter is mainly one of price and the price element has been considerably accentuated during the past 18 months by the general reduction in the purchasing power of the ryot.    The tendency now more than ever is to buy cheap priced qualities and   this is an important factor in connection with the reduction of imports of higher quality goods from abroad.10. Prom the statements enclosed you will see the development which has taken place regarding the relative proportions supplied from Japan and the United Kingdom.    The United Kingdom has lost a very large section of the trade in Greys to Japan,

As regards the question of the re-export of imported piecegoods, it is a little difficult to obtain any definite information.     So far the position seems to be that a company is going to be formed in Bombay with a nominal capital of Rs,25 lakhs and paid-up capital of Rs.5 lakhs,  the amount of paid-up capital subscribed by each mill to depend on the number of looms in the mill.    The Company, so far as I know, has not yet been registered-&quot;- and the idea, seems to be hanging fire for the very obvious reason that there is no export market readily available to which to despatch the foreign goods already imported into India,    The local opinion is inclined to the view that nothing very much will happen and it is doubtful if the scheme   wa,s ever really seriously contemplated.Yours sincerely (Sgd.) D.B. Meek.---Kote , - The Secretary of State for India in answer to a Parliamentary Question on June 8th gave the names of the directors of this Company (which was registered on the 25th May,  )    He stated, however, that the Company had not yet acquired any stocks for re-exportat ion.
