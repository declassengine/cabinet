this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government.Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1931.SECRET. Copy No,    5CP. 177 (31).CABINET.THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION IN NEW SOUTH wales memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1. I WISH to bring to the notice of my colleagues the difficult position which has arisen in New South Wales from the constitutional dispute between the Governor (Sir Philip Game) and his Premier (Mr. Lang).2. Mr. Lang, in a telegram of the 4th July addressed to the Agent-General for New South Wales, which the latter has communicated to me. urges &quot;the Secretary of State for the Dominions to request the Governor of New South Wales to act on the advice of his Ministers and, in particular, to act on the repeated advice of Ministers to appoint a sufficient number of new members to the Legislative Council to ensure the prompt passage through that body of Government measures.&apos;&quot;3. The Legislative Council of New South Wales is a nominated body without limit of numbers; the legal position as to appointments to the Council is set out in Article VII of the Royal Instructions to the Governor of New South Wales, which reads as follows :  &quot;The Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council, is hereby authorised, from time to time, in Our name by an Instrument or Instruments under the Public Seal of the State, to summon to the Legislative Council of the State such person or persons as the Governor and Executive Council shall think fit.....&quot;4. The argument in Mr. Lang&apos;s telegram of the 4th July, and in further telegrams of the 8th, 11th and 13th July, copies of which are attached (Annexes I, II, III and IV), is directed to the contention that the Governor is. constitutionally bound to act on the advice of his Ministers. This contention is supported by the statements (i) that the position of the Governor of an Australian State in relation to the administration of public affairs in the State is in no way different from that of a Governor-General of the Commonwealth in relation to the administration of public affairs in the Commonwealth, which was declared by the Imperial Conference of 1926.(ii) That by the convention governing the relations of the Sovereign and Ministers of Great Britain, the advice of the Ministry is always accepted by the-King in respect of the administration of public affairs.Reference is also made&quot;, in the telegram of the 8th July, to (iii) a dictum of Lord Haldane in a case heard before the Judicial Committee in 1922 (Mackay v. the Attorney-General of British Columbia, 1A.C. (1922), p. 461), and to (iv) correspondence in 1892 regarding a dispute which had arisen in New Zealand between the Governor and Ministers on the question of appointments to the Legislative Council (H. of C. 198 of 1893).
5.   To take these points in order.(i) There was certainly no intention that the doctrine of the 1926 Conference regarding the position of the Governor-General of a Dominion, which was based on the principle of equality of status between Great Britain and the Dominions, should be regarded as applying to the position of the Governor of an Australian State. On the contrary, the declarations of Imperial Conferences, at which the States are not directly represented, cannot be regarded as applying to the States.^ i stated in the House of Commons on the 16th December, 1930, in reply to a question, that the &apos;&apos; conclusions of the Imperial Conference with regard to the appointment of Governors-General of the Dominions do not apply to the Governors of the Australian States, or affect the constitutional position in relation to them.&quot; This pronouncement indicates that the concluding words of Mr. Lang&apos;s telegram of the 4th July, i.e., the words &quot;it is clear to His Majesty&apos;s Ministers that they have the right and duty to approach His Majesty in regard to the Governor as His Majesty&apos;s representative,&quot; are incorrect. There is no justification for the claim that the Ministers of an Australian State have the right to approach His Majesty direct.(ii) The statement regarding the position of the King in this country, on which Mr. Lang bases his argument, raises an issue of peculiar difficulty and importance. So far as is known, there is no authoritative pronouncement which would confirm the view stated by Mr. Lang that by convention &quot; the advice of the Ministry is always accepted by the King.&quot; The recognised constitutional position is to be found in such statements as that of the Imperial Conference of 1930 (p. 27 of Cmd. 3717 on the question of the appointment of Governors-General), that &quot; the constitutional practice that His Majesty acts on the advice of responsible Ministers applies also in this instance,&quot; or the dictum of Lord Haldane, to winch Mr. Lang refers, that the character of any constitution which follows, as that of British Columbia does, the type of responsible Govern-ment in the British Empire, requires that the Sovereign or his representative should act on the advice of Ministers responsible to Parliament, that is to say, should not act individually, but constitutionally.&quot; These statements evidently mean that the King&apos;s acts are covered by Ministerial responsibility and are not directed to the question whether the King is bound in every case to accept the advice of his Ministers. In connexion with a question which arose in Victoria as to the grant of a dissolution, Sir William Jowitt, in reply to an informal request for advice, stated (inter alia) that &quot; the fact that the Sovereign does not take independent action without ministerial advice does not logically involve that whatever ministerial advice is tendered must be accepted.&quot; The Sovereign normally accepts the advice of his Ministers, and the situation, if advice were not accepted, would presumably be resolved either by (a) the acquiescence of Ministers, in which case they accept the &quot; responsibility,&quot; or (b) the resignation of Ministers, in which case the succeeding Ministers must accept the &quot; responsibility.&quot; But it would obviously be undesirable to make any positive declaration on so fundamental and delicate a question in dealing with the present controversy. I have kept this consideration in view in drafting the proposed reply to Mr. Lang (see paragraph 3 of Annex V).(iii) The dictum of Lord Haldane occurred in the judgment on a case where the point at issue was whether a certain executive act could be presumed to have been duly performed by the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia, and the argument was that, in the absence of an Order in Council embodying the formal advice of Ministers, it could not. Thus, having regard to its context, the dictum is not relevant to the question now at issue; and, moreover, even taken by itself, it does not, as shown above, support the construction which Mr. Lang endeavours to place upon it.(iv) It is not clear whether Mr. Lang refers to the New Zealand case as supporting (a) his contention that the Governor should accept the advice of Ministers^or (&amp;) his request to the Secretary of State to intervene. So far as (a) is concerned, it may be said that, while, on the merits of that particular case (which* Mote. It may be worth while mentioning in this connexion that some of the States (though not New South Wales) have recently represented that the recommendations of the Imperial Conference of 1930 on another matter (viz.. the proposed Statute of Westminster&quot;) should not be put into operation without further opportunity for consideration whether the recommendations affect the position of the States.
differed in various important respects from the present case), the then Secretary of State (Lord Ripon) took the view that the difference between nine (the number of appointments to the Legislative Council which the Governor was prepared to make) and twelve (the number for which Ministers asked) was not &quot; so great and important as to require a Governor to assume the very serious responsibility of declining to act on the advice of his Ministers, and possibly of having, in consequence, to find other advisers,&quot; the correspondence shows that it was held that in certain extreme circumstances the Governor &quot; must be prepared to accept the grave responsibility of seeking other advisers.&quot; It does not, therefore, bear out Mr. Lang&apos;s contention that in all circumstances the Governor must accept the advice of Ministers. As regards (&amp;), it should be observed that the Secretary of State first dealt with the matter on the assumption that it had been referred to him for his opinion by the Governor and Ministers as a joint reference, though when the Governor demurred to this interpretation, he was informed by Lord Ripon that &quot; I am of opinion that I should not be justified in refusing an expression of my views when it is asked for by the Governor or by his constitutional advisers.&quot; A different view has, however, been taken in subsequent cases in which a Secretary of State has had occasion to consider his attitude towards a request for intervention, and, in any case, as will be seen from the observations set out below, it is very doubtful how far, if at all, this dictum of Lord Ripon in 1893 is applicable to the circumstances of to-day.6. It has been shown above that the arguments adduced by Mr. Lang do not support his contention that whatever ministerial advice is tendered must be accepted, and it remains to consider the question in the light of the position of an Australian State Governor as such. So far as the purely legal aspect is concerned, the matter is covered by xArticle VI of the Royal Instructions* to the Governor of New South Wales, which provides that, &quot; in the exercise of the powers and authorities vested in him, the Governor shall be guided by the advice, of the Executive Council, but if in any case he shall see sufficient cause to dissent from the opinion of the said Council, he mecy act in the exercise of his said powers and authorities in opposition to the opinion of the Council, reporting the matter to Us without delay, with- the reasons for his so acting.&apos;&apos;7. The constitutional aspect was exhaustively- considered in the early part of 1926, when a similar situation had arisen owing to the refusal of the then Governor (Sir D. de Chair) to accept the advice of his Premier (Mr. Lang) in regard to appointments to the Legislative Council. The conclusion was reached that, on the authorities and precedents then examined, it was clear that the Governor of an Australian State could, in certain circumstances, exercise a discretion as to the acceptance of ministerial advice; the limits of this discretion could not be precisely&apos; defined, but it was, at any rate, clear that they did not exclude the question of advice as to appointments to the Legislative Council.8. It might perhaps be urged that there have been constitutional develop-ments since the summer of 1926 which would alter the position; but to this, it is suggested, the answer must be in the negative, since the arguments, which Mr. Lang bases on the work of the Imperial Conferences of 1926 and 1930, cannot, as indicated above, be accepted.9. The final question is what should be my attitude towards the request that I should intervene.The legal position is governed by Article II of the Letters Patent constituting the office of Governor of New South Wales, which reads as follows: &quot;We do hereby authorise, empower, and command Our said Governor to do and execute all things that belong to his said office according to the tenor of these Our Letters Patent and of such Commission as may be issued to him under Our Sign Manual and Signet, and according to such Instructions as may from time to time be given to him under Our Sign Manual and Signet or by Order in Our Privy Council, or by Us, through one of Our Principal Secretaries of State, and to such Laws as are now or shall hereafter be in force in the State.&quot;* Note. A similar article appears in the Royal Instructions to the Governors of the other Australian States and also in those to the Governor-General of New Zealand and the Governor of&quot; Newfoundland. - ..
10. The question of intervention had to be considered in 1926 in the circum-stances mentioned in paragraph 7 above. After a refusal (in December 1925) bv the then Secretary of State (Mr. Amery) to issue instructions to the Governor in the matter, Mr. McTiernan (then Attorney-General of New South Wales) was sent to London to make a further request for the intervention of the secretary of State. After careful consideration, in the light of the examination of the position referred to in paragraph 7 above, Mr. Amory sent a letter to Mr. McTiernan, in which, after referring to a statement made by him in the House of Commons (on the 15th March, 1926) that &quot; it would not be proper for the Secretary of State to issue instructions to the Governor with regard to the exercise of his constitutional duties,&quot; he continued : &quot; To this attitude I feel that I must firmly adhere. It would, in my opinion, be wholly incompatible with the status of New South Wales in the Empire that Ministers at home should purport to intervene in its internal affairs.&quot; The general intention of my telegram to the Governor which you quote was that the matter with regard to which he had communicated with me was essentially one to be settled in New South Wales and not in London. As to the powers exercisable by the Governor in relation to appointments to the Legislative Council, this is a matter on which I could not express any opinion consistently with the principles on which my general attitude is based. I am aware that you hold that under the constitutional usage of New South Wales the Governor has now no option but to make appointments to the Legislative Council as and when advised by Ministers. On the constitutional usage of the State I am not qualified to speak, even if I were so disposed, but it is at least clear that I could not accept your view without in effect instructing the Governor that he must make the appointments which he has declined to make.&quot;11. It may be of interest in this connexion to quote the view of Sir W. Harrison Moore (a well-known constitutional lawyer in Australia, who, in fact, represented the Commonwealth at the Dominion Legislation Conference in 1929).   His view was expressed as follows : &quot; In the exercise of the functions which belong to a Governor as constitutional head of the State Government as distinguished from those which may belong to him as an officer of the Crown representing in particular matters Imperial interests he cannot properly be instructed by the British Government without detracting from the dignity and independence of his office as representative of the King and without an intrusion of the British Government into the domestic concerns of the State, in derogation of the principles of responsible Government and the constitutional rights of the people.&quot;12. Before bringing the matter before my colleagues, I thought it advisable to ascertain informally the views of both the Law Officers on the subject, and the following paragraphs^ (in the terms of which they have concurred) set out the substance of the advice which they have given me as to the constitutional position in New South Wales.13 (a) The Ministers of New South Wales must deal with the Governor alone; they have no right to approach the King direct, nor can they require their advice to be forwarded to His Majesty.(b) The King has a right to enquire into the conduct of a Governor, who is His Majesty&apos;s representative, and to give him directions.(c) In exercising this right, His Majesty would act on the advice of Ministers in the United Kingdom.14. It follows from the above that in the representations which Mr. Lang has caused to be made to me he cannot be regarded as tendering Ministerial advice which it would be my constitutional duty to submit to the King. His position as Premier entitles him to a courteous hearing, but the responsibility for reaching a decision is that of Ministers here.15. On the other hand, these propositions involve also that it is the responsibility of the King, acting on the advice of Ministers here, to be satisfied that the Governor is performing the duties entrusted to him as the representative
cJ it Qoof His Majesty in a constitutional manner, and occasions might arise in which it would Be not only proper but necessary for instructions to be given in His Majesty&apos;s name to the Governor.16. The question then arises whether the present is such an occasion. On this point the Law Officers and I feel that there is no ground for taking the view that Sir P. Game has so far acted otherwise than in a constitutional manner, and that therefore I am not called upon to intervene in the manner requested by Mr. Lang.17.   There remains the question of the reply to be returned to Mr. Lang.18. In the light of the propositions set out above the Law Officers feel doubtful whether the form of the reply which Mr. Amery sent on a similar occasion in 1926 (referred to above) is satisfactory as a precedent, since, in their opinion, it might be held not to have safeguarded adequately the right of Ministers here to intervene in a proper case. On the other hand, the fact that, as stated above, Mr. Lang cannot be admitted to have any right to call for my intervention, and the conclusion reached that the present case is not one in which intervention is proper, would seem to render it inadvisable to enter into any lengthy or controversial argument on the position.19. I would propose therefore-, if my colleagues concur, that my reply should be in the terms of the draft letter attached as Annex V, in which the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General have concurred.20. I ought to add that discussions are still proceeding between the Governor and Mr. Lang with a view to effecting a settlement of the difficulty.I propose, therefore, not to send the letter to Mr. Willis unless and until I am satisfied that no further progress can be made locally until my reply to the request for intervention is received.J. H. T.Dominions Office, July 20, 1931.
Copy of&apos;Cablegram from Mr. Lang to the Agent-General for New South WalesJuly 4, 1931.(Left bv Mr. Willis with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,July 6, 1931.)THE present Parliament came into being by a general election of member(s) of Legislative Assembly held on the 25th October, 1930, at which the previous Government was overwhelmingly defeated,That election resulted in return of 55 members Labour party to which the present Government belongs and of 35 members combined Opposition parties to which the defeated Government belonged.The other House of Legislature, the Legislative Council, is entirely composed of persons appointed by Governor for life.An industrial conciliation and arbitration Bill was passed by Legislative Assembly by a majority of 28.On the 18th March last the representative of the Government in Legislative Council moved this Bill be read a second time, but next day that body carried an amendment that Bill be referred to a select committee of certain of its members.The Government regard prompt and speedy passage of this Bill as of utmost importance, and its passage is required by Government in fulfilment an important part of policy speech delivered by present Premier to electors prior to last general election.The reference to a select committee by Legislative Council was contrary to strong desire of Government, and has resulted in great delay, as this committee is still sitting on Bill.A Bill for reduction of interest generally was passed by the Legislative Assembly on the 19th March last and nominee Legislative Council on Bill being-sent them postponed its consideration for (\ six months) and this prevented Bill from being considered again in same session.This Bill was designed to the due sharing of the abnormal and pressing-burden of the times by persons with fixed incomes from (? interests).The plan adopted by the conference of the Premiers of Australia held in May last determined upon reduction by all Banks rate of interest on deposits and advances and upon reduction in (? interest) upon mortgage as two out of the five measures necessary for meeting the present grave financial emergency.An emergency income tax Bill was passed by the Legislative Assembly by (? 45) votes to 26 votes and wras rejected by the Legislative Council on the 29th June, ultimo.This Bill was designed to impose (? extra) graduated tax(es) on income derived from wages and other sources, and was regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Minister(s) and Legislative Assembly as demanded for continuance of essential and necessary Government services and towrards the relief of unprecedented unemployment.The rejection of this Bill is obviously an invasion by nominee House into -the most important of the responsibilities right and duties of duly elected repre-sentatives of people who constitute the Legislative Assembly and attempt to prevent His Majesty&apos;s Ministers who have the full confidence of Legislative Assembly from carrying out their duties and powers to govern the State.The membership of the Legislative Council is unlimited in number and members thereof who support the Government policy are greatly inferior in number to the remainder of the body.The Legislative Council as now constituted has prevented and delayed prompt passage into law policy and other measures which the Government and members of the Legislative Assembly supporting them consider vital and urgent and the Government and Legislative Assembly greatly fear that the Council will pursue the same course with increasing boldness.(On several occasions) the Ministers of His Majesty for the State of Newr South Wales met and after full discussion decided to advise the Governor to appoint sufficient new members to the Legislative Council to ensure the prompt passage into law of measures necessary to carry out the policy of the Government and the party to which it belongs.
On four occasions the Ministers advised the Governor to appoint a sufficient number of new members to the Legislative Council to ensure the prompt passage -of their measures through that body and after the Governor refused to act on this advice and a full discussion of the matter, the Ministers persist in their advice, but the Governor still refuses to make appointments, notwithstanding that he, when originally advised so to act, promised to make them in circumstances that have since happened.The Governor apparently holds views that he has a personal responsibility to the people and a personal discretion as to the merits of the proposed legislation and otherwise, and that he is not bound to act therein on the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Ministers.As indicating the attitude of the Governor to his Ministers as early as March last, and within five months of the General Election at which the Government was returned, as tabled correspondence with the Governor shows, he was actually -seriously considering immediate dismissal of His Majesty &quot;s Ministers without any sign(s) that the Ministers had lost a single supporter?.) New South Wales has had representative and responsible Government for over seventy-five years, and Commonwealth Australia was created out of States to exercise the powers to legislate (? on certain) specific subject(s), while State(s) continued to have all the residuary power(s).By the convention(s) governing (the) relations of the Sovereign and Ministers (of) Great Britain, the advice of Ministry is always accepted by the King in respect of the administration of public affairs, and Imperial Conference, 1928, laid down doctrine that true position Governor(s)-General or the Governor of Dominion was similar in all essential in such matters to that of the Sovereign in regard to Great Britain.The relations between the Governor of New South Wales and his Ministers &apos; cannot be any different to the relations between the Governors-General of the Commonwealth of Australia and, after the Governor refused to act on this advice, and a full discussion of the matter, the Ministers persist in their advice, but the Governor still refuses to make appointments notwithstanding that he, when originally advised so to act. promised to make them, in the circumstances, -and he (his) Ministers. It is undoubted that the relative(ly) positions State(s) and -Commonwealth show Governor is as much representative of His Majesty&apos;s for State purposes as the Governor-General of Commonwealth of Australia is for the Commonwealth purposes.The representative and responsible Government vested in State is of precisely same quality as that vested in Commonwealth and, consequently, -although State(s) of Commonwealth were not represented at (the) 1926 and (the) 1927 Imperial Conferences, to (the) constitutional position is that stated in paragraph 4 (b) of the Report of Proceedings of the Conference of 1926, that is, that the position of the Governor is similar in all essential respects to that held by His Majesty in relation to the public affairs of Great Britain(.) As regards the Commonwealth, the principle that the Governor-General of the Common-wealth is bound to act on the advice of his Ministers was emphatically reaffirmed last month by the present Governor-General of the Commonwealth, a great constitutional lawyer, and this applies, no less, to the Governor of New South Wales.Without this principle being observed by the Governor, he could hardly be kept out of the political arena, a danger that the Government naturally (? desires to) avoid.The Government of New South Wales, and Members of the Legislative Assembly supporting them, strongly urge the Secretary of State for the Dominions to request the Governor of New South Wales to act on the advice of his Ministers and, in particular, to act on the repeated advice of Ministers to appoint a sufficient number of new members to the Legislative Council to ensure the prompt passage through that body of Government measures.The pending litigation concerning the abolition of the Legislative Council does not affect this question.It is clear to His Majesty&apos;s Ministers that they have the right and duty to approach His Majesty in regard to the Governor as His Majesty&apos;s representative.
Annex III.Telegram from Mr. Lang to the Agent-General for New Zealand, dated July 11. (Sent by Mr. Willis to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.)Received July 13, 1931.THE following is written to meet the suggestion that there should be a dissolution, and that the Secretary of State should take no action.The Crown is admittedly one, and indivisible throughout the Empire, but it acts in different areas and in different spheres by different Ministers.   Thus.Copy of Cablegram from Mr. Lang to the Agent-General for Neiv Soitth Wales..July 8, 1931.(Sent by Mr. Willis to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs on July 9.)FURTHER to my telegram of 3rd July. Resolution of the Legislative Assembly forwarded separately freely and overwhelmingly, inter alia, declares that it was the bounden duty of the Governor to accept the advice of Ministers. All the Cabinet Ministers met the Governor at the Executive Council to-day. Minute recommending appointments to the Legislative Council was approved by them unanimously. Governor refused to sign Minute, stating that the whole matter was now one entirely for the determination of the Dominions Office. Governors view, expressed personally, claims for himself a right to exercise a personal discretion, astounding that, after 75 years of responsible Government, such a claim should be advanced and acted upon. Such a claim is clearly contrary to all recognised and binding authorities. In delivering this judgment Privy Council, in the Mackay versus Attorney-General of British Columbia, 1922, one appeal case at page 461, Lord Haldane stated :  Begins: The character of any Constitution which follows, as that of British Columbia does, the type of responsible Government in the British Empire, requires Sovereign or his representative should act on the advice of Ministers responsible to Parliament, that is to say, should not act individually, but constitutionally.   Ends.This is a binding declaration of principle by highest Court in the Empix-e, and conclusively establishes that the Governor &apos;s attitude is wrong.As far back as 1892, the Secretary of State for the Colonies advised the Governor of New Zealand to accept the advice of his Ministers in regard to appointments to Legislative Council. Since 1892 the development of constitutional law and practice has confirmed the authority of the Legislative Assembly and its duties and rights to have its measures enacted into law. This applies particularly in the present case, where Legislative Assembly has recently been elected containing an overwhelming majority supporters of Government. Such a Legislative Assembly must be taken conclusively to represent the present deliberate views of the people. The facts in the subject case are that the Legislative Assembly has had its will thwarted, not in case of one Bill only, but of several.In addition to the Bill referred to in the Resolution of the Legislative Assembly, separately forwarded, the Legislative Council has mutilated a Transport Co-ordination Bill, which formed a definite and clear part of the Premier&apos;s policy speech anterior to the last General Election and constituted a definite mandate.In order to enable the will of the people to be given effect to and well established principle(s) of responsible Government carried out, the Governor should accept the advice of his responsible Ministers, which has been persisted in after discussion, and as views animating the Governor have been demonstrated above to be contrary to final and binding authority, the Secretary of State for the Dominions is requested to instruct the Governor accordingly.
in Great Britain it acts by one set of Ministers, and it acts in Australia by one set of Ministers for certain, definitely limited and specific powers, and it acts by other Ministers for whole residuary powers. New South Wales comes in this last class and the Commonwealth in the former. The Sovereign, not being personally present in New South Wales, acts in New South Wales by a repre-sentative, the Governor. If the Sovereign were personally present in New South Wales there can be no doubt that he would, as to all matters that are within the jurisdiction of the New South Wales Parliament, be advised by the Ministers for New South Wales, and that he would accept and act on their advice. The Governor cannot possibly be in any different position to the Sovereign if the Sovereign were personally present and reigned in New South Wales. The Governor, therefore, does not govern, but reigns, and does not act individually on his personal views, but acts constitutionally that is, on the advice of his Ministers.Professor Keith&apos;s suggestion of a dissolution is antiquated, absurd, puerile and unjust, as will be shown.Professor Keith is a partisan, opposed to the Labour Party, and his judgment ca.not be accepted as sound. He also fails in his writing to give full and proper effect to the fundamental conception of responsible Government : That is, that the nature of responsible Government is the same throughout the Empire; and to the principle above outlined as to the proper advisers of the Crown being Ministers of the Crown, in a particular area or sphere; and the duties of King and Governor alike to act constitutionally and not individually.Professor Keith also admits that his view does not accord with the views of Lord Birkenhead, expressed in June 1927, or the action of the Secretary of State in 1924 in the case of Tasmania.The Legislative Assembly has only recently been elected, giving Party Government a record majority, and that Party is entitled to say, without dispute, that its policy represents the will of the electorates, and the electorates are entitled to have that policy carried into law.The ageJong dispute in England, between the Houses was settled by Parliament Act of 1911, and that settlement established for ever, the principle of the supreme elective House, as representing the will of the electorates. That principle has been accepted as the basis of the relation between the Houses in Newfoundland and Quebec, and the same result should be declared and confirmed for New South Wales the only other part of the Empire with an unlimited nominee House. The customs, conventions and practice respecting responsible Government have been and are, the result of growth, and the nature and working of responsible Government is the same throughout the Empire. There is not one sort for one place or sphere of operations, and another, or others for other places and other spheres. Hence, the settlement of the relations of the two Houses that the Parliament Act of 1911 effected for Great Britain, by confirming the supremacy of the elective House, ought to be confirmed as the basis in the case of New South Wales.Doing this does not involve any legislation by the Imperial Parliament for New South Wales, but only an exercise of power, deliberately left by the Constitution Act to the Crown, of making appointments to the Legislative Council. This power of making unlimited appointments was clearly left to the Crown for the very purpose of meeting a situation such as the present, and of preventing by its actual exercise, or by the promise of its exercise, the will of the electorates expressed by their Governments recently-elected Assembly from being&apos; thwarted. The Conference of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and Premiers of all the States and Leaders of the Opposition in the Commonwealth Parliament last month deliberately resolved having most carefully considered the financial position of the Commonwealth and of the States and recognising the national inability to meet the existing Government charges and were unanimously of the opinion that to prevent national default in the immediate future, and a general failure to meet the Governments payments, all expendi-ture, including interest on Government securities and other interest, must be substantially reduced. In addition to these drastic measures, the plans a,adopted by the same Conference also included the securing of additional revenue by taxation, both Commonwealth and State. The deficit for New South Wales for the financial year amounts to  8,939,466.   To cany out the plans adopted by
that Conference requires concurrent legislation by the Commonwealth and the States, and the failure of one State to pass a Statute ratifying the agreement arrved at by the Conference will frustrate the plans of the Conference for the Commonwealth and all the States.Not only time and expense, but also the interests of the Commonwealth and the other States tells against a dissolution.It is in the time and circumstances as above mentioned that the nominee Council has seen fit to thwart the will of the Legislative Assembly by rejecting for the first time for thirty-six years a money Bill, and defeating and delaying important measures of policy passed by the Assembly.The Constitution Act fortunately provides a remedy for the electorates against the nominee Council&apos;s repeated refusal and disinclination to submit to the will of the representative electorates. That remedy is for the Crown to appoint, or threaten to appoint, sufficient new members to the Council.If the Governor can ignore the advice of Ministers to take that course, then the remedy that the law provides is denied to electors, and electorates would, contrary to the intentions of the Constitution Act, be left without a remedy against obstruction and rejection inflicted by Council on them. But the existence of the Ministers for New South Wales is for the purpose of giving advice to the Governor, which they have, and they accept full responsibility for that advice and for the Governors action in accordance with it, and there is no question that if the Governor acts on that advice he acts constitutionally, and cannot be criticised. This cannot be said if the Governor refuses to accept advice.Of course the present question is a local one; it is the foundation of the case of the Government of New South Wales that the matter is a local one, and for that very reason they are the constitutional advisers of the Sovereign^ representative, and having tendered advice to him, he having to act constitu-tionally, ought to accept that advice for wdiich they, and they alone, are responsible.But, the Governor, instead of recognising his duty to act constitutionally, claims a free personl discretion, contrary to legal opinion given to him by his official legal adviser the Attorney-General for New South Wales. The matter now stands that notwithstanding that legal opinion and advice of his Ministers and the deliberate vieAV of an overwhelming majority of the Legislative Assembly recently elected the Governor wishes his position to be indicated by the Secretary of State. The Government asks the Secretary of State to do this at once, by informing the Governor that it is his duty to accept his Ministers&apos; advice, and so relieve the Crown and himself of all responsibility. For the Secretary of State merely to tell the Governor that it is a local matter is worse than useless, as it would have the effect of maintaining the Governor in his unconstitutional views.(1) Legislative Council is a Nominee Chamber whose personnel has not been added to since previous Parliament, during which Parliament the Council consistently approved of the legislation inaugurated by the last Government, which Government and its legislation was decisively rejected at the recent general election. Legislative Council is adopting purely Party attitude. It is non-repre-sentative of the public interest, and its continued actions show it completely out of touch with the will of the people, as declared at the last general election. It has repeatedly rejected or amended measures approved by the electors, which have been the subject of adequate investigation, and of which reasonable discussion has been permitted. The history of the nominee Chamber in this State shows that when a Labour Government is in power, measures sent for consideration of the Legislative Council have always been declared disastrous to the State, and if their present attitude is to be supported, the effect is that Anti-Labour will always govern in New South Wales irrespective of the wishes of the people. When Anti-Labour has a majority in the Assembly, the Legisla-tive Council is quiescent. When Labour has a majority, the Legislative Council claims to interpret the public interests.(2) The principle adopted by the Legislative Council with regard to the Bill referred to in this paragraph, has been the principle of opposition to legisla-tion. because the majority of the Members of the Legislative Council belong to a party or to parties opposed to the Government.
(3) With reference to the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, the Government claims (a) That it is definitely part of the policy announced by the present Premier at the recent general election, and of the platform of the Labour Party;(6) That it does not exceed that policy:(c) The provisions of an Act of Parliament cannot obviously be included inthe policy speech;(d) It is not for a Nominee and non-representative Chamber to interpret themandate of the people. That is more properly a function of the Assembly, whose Members are responsible to the people.The Select Committee of the Legislative Council on this Bill was appointed in March last, and is still sitting, and the life of a Parliament in New South Wales is three years only.The Reduction of Interest Bill reducing interest in New South Wales, was definitely part of the Premiers Policy speech, when he announced that he would introduce legislation to reduce interest rates in the community. Far from being repudiation. Since it was shelved by the Legislative Council, the principle of reducing interest on existing contracts has become an integral part of the rehabilitation-tation plan of the Premiers&apos; Conference held at Melbourne in May-June last, at which Conference the Premiers of all the States and the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia (the Leader of the Federal Opposition concurring) pledged themselves to introduce legislation reducing interest rates, thus adopting the principle of this Bill.The Emergency Income Tax Bill was to provide for essential and Govern-ment service, and for relief of unemployment, and does not conflict in any way with the plan devised by the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States, which plan the Government of New South Wales is putting into execution as made, and along lines, and in the manner made clear by the Premier of New South Wales at that Conference and accepted by the Conference.What would appear to frustrate or destroy the plan referred to, is the declared opposition of the Legislative Council in March last, to any reduction of interest rates in New South Wales, when the Council postponed consideration of the Bill for six months. If the Council persists in this attitude, this part of the rehabilitation plan will be prevented, not by the people&apos;s representatives, but by the Nominee Chamber, from having force and effect.In passing these measures, all rules of the Assembly were followed, and it is not for the Council to lay down rules of conduct for the Assembly.(4) The Nominee Chamber has taken from the Assembly the rights of imposing taxation, and of carrying into effect fundamental parts of the Premier&apos;s mandate.The Legislative Council conveniently forgot to mention in its resolution, that prior to this resolution being carried, and at the very same sitting, it was engaged in the task of deleting the fundamental provision and otherwise mutilating the Co-ordinating Transport Bill, which was a very prominent part of the Premier&apos;s Policy^ speech, and of the general campaign, as Government plan for effectively dealing with the State Railways and Treasury Bill deficit, which is one of the greatest problems of the present-day Government in New South Wales.The Legislative Council did not claim in the last Parliament, and has never claimed previously, the right to reject measures not included in the policy speech of the Premier. For in the last Parliament, the policy speech of the then Premier was admittedly departed from in many important matters, such as the definite promise not to interfere with the 44-hour week Arbitration Award, and many others, and no such claim was made by the Legislative Council. But all measures were promptly passed by that Chamber. To suggest that no Government should be entitled to have the concurrence of the Legislative Council to any measure not referred to in the policy speech would be to reduce responsible Government to an absurdity.(5) Seeing that the election took place as lately as the 25th October last; that previous Government was rejected, and the present Government elected with one of the largest majorities in the history of  his State 55 Members in a
House of 90 and that the Government has not lost a single supporter; and the Nominee Chamber has rejected, or amended, or postponed, not one, but several Bills, including a Taxation Bill; the Government claims that the Assembly was justified, in this case, in asserting that His Excellency the Governor should take the advice of his Ministers persistently tendered.Annex IV.Summary of Telegram from Mr. Lang to the Agent-General for New SouthWales, dated&apos;July 13, 1931.(Sent by Mr. Willis to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs on July 14.)THE Government case upon the Constitutional question involved may be summarised as follows : The repeated actions of the Legislative Council have made new appointments to that body necessary, in order that proper Money Bills and other measures may be carried into law.The precise question in dispute concerns the proposal of His Majesty&apos;s New South Wales Ministers, responsible to the Legislative Assembly in New South Wales, to have appointments made to the Legislative Council, which is the only nominee Upper Chamber in Australia. The proposal affects the exercise of an Executive power of a local nature.The decision of the Imperial Conferences of 1926 and 1930 determining the Constitutional status of the Governors-General of the Dominions (including the Federal Commonwealth of Australia) finally determined the principle upon which the executive powers vested by New South Wales in His Majesty or His repre-sentative must be exercised, %.e., solely upon the advice and responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Ministers acting in his relevant, jurisdictional area.The recent appointments of the Governor-General of Canada and the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia illustrate the application of this principle to the office of Governor-General itself.It is elementary Constitutional law that not only the Legislative but Executive powers of New South Wales are based on least equality with, and similar in principle to, those of the Commonwealth of Australia, constituted by 63 and 64 Victoria C. 12, Attorney-General of Commonwealth versus Colonial Sugar Refining Company, 1914 A.C. per Lord Haldane, page 252 et seq.The absence of the State from two Imperial Conferences is immaterial. Once the question of the exercise of executive powers in respect of the Common-wealth of Australia was determined, the same principle cannot be denied in the case of the State of New South Wales.The exercise of executive powers is an essential part of self-governing rights. If it is denied to His Majesty&apos;s New South Wales Ministers, it is pro tanto a denial to responsible self-government.Responsibility for executive acts affecting New South Wales must rest with (a) His Majesty personally; or(b) The Governor personally;(c) His Majesty&apos;s Government; or(d) His Majesty&apos;s New South Wales Ministers.The alternatives (a), (b) and (c) are clearly inapplicable. The suggestion (b) is entirely inconsistent with the whole history of the growth of self-government it would be an intolerable position if complete freedom from the exercise of control of a Governor by His Majesty&apos;s Government had been achieved, in order to be replaced by the exercise of control by an individual unacquainted with the State, and responsible neither to the Imperial nor local Parliament.The position at present is that the Governor is awaiting an intimation from the Secretary of State, whether in a purely local matter he has an independent discretion, but the Ministers for New South Wales are aware that it inexorably results from the foregoing that they have the right of directly advising the Sovereign in regard to the Governor.
oDraft of Letter to the Honourable A. C. Willis [Agent-General for new South Wales).1. I HAVE now carefully considered the proposal contained in Mr. Lang&apos;s telegram of the 4th July, which you handed to me on the 6th July, that I should &apos;&apos; request the Governor of New South Wales to act on the advice of his Ministers and, in particular, to act on the repeated advice of Ministers to appoint a sufficient number of new members to the Legislative Council to ensure the prompt passage through that body of Government measures.&quot;2. As a result of my examination of the question, the position appears to me to be as follows. The Governor of New South Wales has undoubtedly a discretion in the exercise of the constitutional powers vested in him as the representative of His Majesty. In the circumstances of the present case, which arises in relation to the internal affairs of New South Wales, I am not prepared to advise His Majesty to issue any instructions to the Governor as to the manner in which that discretion should be exercised.3. While I have not felt it necessary to enter into any detailed discussion upon the arguments adduced in Mr. Lang&apos;s telegrams in support of his contentions, I must guard myself against any inference that, by my silence, I am admitting the validity of those arguments. In particular, I stated in the House of Commons, in December last, that &apos;&apos; the conclusions of the Imperial Conference with regard to the appointment of Governors-General of the Dominions did not apply to the Governors of the Australian States or affect the constitutional position in relation to them.&quot; Further, I could not accept Mr. Lang&apos;s statement regarding the relations of the Sovereign and Ministers in Great Britain as in all respects an accurate statement of the constitutional position.4.   I am communicating a copy of this letter to Sir P. Game by telegram.
