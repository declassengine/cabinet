GERMANY. June 13, 1931.CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.[C 4041/2018/18] No. 1.Mr. A. Henderson to Mr. Yencken (Berlin). (No 627.   Confidential.)Sir, Foreign Office, June 13, 1931.WITH reference to my telegram No. 62 of the 9th June, I transmit to you herewith a record of the conversations with the German Ministers which took place at Chequers on the 7th June. No mention was made of disarmament during these conversations.2. On the 8th June the French and Italian Ambassadors, and on the 9th June the Belgian counsellor, were informed of the gist of these discussions.I am, &amp;c.ARTHUR HENDERSON.Enclosure in No. 1.Summary of the Discussion with the German Ministers atSunday, June 7, 1931.Chequers &quot; on present :The Prime Minister. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The President of the Board of Trade. Sir Robert Vansittart. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross.The German Chancellor(Dr. Briining). The    German    Foreign    Minister(Dr. Curtius). Dr. Schmidt (Interpreter).(During part of the discussion the Governor of the Bank of England, the German Ambassador and Count Bernstorff were also present.)The Prime Minister began by referring to one point which had arisen during the discussion on Saturday. Both the German and British Ministers had remarked how fortunate it was that Mr. Stimson, the American Secretary of State, was visiting Europe this summer. This visit would enable Mr. Stimson to obtain first-hand knowledge of the situation in Europe, and the hope had been expressed that the impressions he received might influence the attitude of Washington. The Prime Minister thought that it was very desirable that neither in Germany nor in Great Britain should any publicity be given to such hopes, otherwise Mr. Stimson would be put in a very difficult position, and any prospects of good results from the visit would be destroyed. He pointed out the present political and economic position of the United States, and said that with the best will in the world the authorities there might find that little or nothing-could be done. None of us ought to embarrass them. He had been rather surprised that Mr. Stimson&apos;s visit should have been already announced in the press, as he had just been told of it in great confidence.Dr. Briining said that he, too, had been warned of Mr. Stimson&apos;s visit in the strictest confidence, and had been surprised to find it announced in the papers. He agreed entirely that the visit should not be publicly referred to as likely to affect the attitude of America. He hoped, of course, to put before Mr. Stimson the position in Germany just as he had put it to the British Ministers, and it would be useful to knowr the reaction. As he had explained on the previous day, the German Government had gone to the utmost limit in enforcing new taxation and economies.   The new decree-had on the whole been[167 n-1] b
well received by the German press, but the People&apos;s party had declared their opposition, which reduced the Governments majority to a very small figure. The German Government could not go further without grave danger of social unrest. The Young plan gave Germany the right to suspend the conditional payments, but three months&apos; notice had to be given beforehand. He was, therefore, compelled to look ahead; he would carry on as long as possible, but he felt that the limit would be reached at latest in November next.Mr. Henderson said this was a very serious statement. They all recognised the difficulties of the German Government, but these difficulties could not be settled by one or two countries alone, they were world-wide. The question was whether there was anything we could do to meet the situation which would arise in a few months. It seemed to him that the best chance was to make use of the committees set up by the Commission of Enquiry into the European Union last month. They had appointed two Expert Committees, one of economists and one of financiers, with a Political Committee to co-ordinate their work. These committees would have a very wide reference, and they might be useful in preparing the ground.Dr. Curtius did not think that this line of approach was possible or expedient. The Expert Committees were limited to the investigation of the various proposals which had been put forward at Geneva, and they could not enter into any discussion of reparations. The Co-ordinating Committee, on the other hand, would consist of representatives of the twenty-seven European States, and any discussion of reparations there would be likely to antagonise the United States as being an attempt to make a common front in Europe against America. He felt that the only body to which the reparation question could be referred was the Bank for International Settlements, whose duty it was to supervise the working of the Young plan.In answer to some observations of Sir Robert Vansittart on long-term credits, and some actions of the German Government which had not had the effect of encouraging them, Dr. Curtius stated that Germany was long past loans and had neither the desire nor the ability to solve her difficulties in that way.Mr. Henderson thought that Dr. Curtius had not fully appreciated the decisions taken at Geneva. He referred to the document, and pointed out that the committees had been given the widest possible reference. The Committee of Economists was to examine &quot; in complete freedom and in a spirit of liberal understanding all means which may seem calculated to bring about closer and more fruitful co-operation between the different countries with a view to improving the organisation of production and trade.&quot; The Co-ordinating Committee was to co-ordinate and amplify the conclusions of the Expert Committees. &quot; But its competence will not necessarily be limited to tlhe questions dealt with at those meetings. On the contrary, the economic sphere with which it will deal is to be conceived on the widest lines. It will, therefore, be free to make to the Commission of Enquiry any proposals on economic questions that it may think fit.&quot; He did not suggest that these committees could enter into details or put forward definite proposals for the settlement of reparations, but they might well draw the attention of the world to the importance of the subject, as one of the elements in the present world crisis, and thus put the question to the Governments to deal with.Dr. Curtius pointed out that the Economic Committee&apos;s reference was limited to proposals for improving &quot;the organisation of production and trade,&quot; and though the Co-ordinating Committee had a wider reference he still adhered to his view that it was very difficult for them to discuss reparations.Sir Frederick Leith-Ross suggested that the points of view put forward by Dr. Curtius and the Secretary of State were not necessarily opposed. He agreed with Dr. Ciirtius that the European Union was not a suitable body for revising the reparation settlement; indeed, any direct attempt to revise the Young-plan at the present time seemed to him most difficult and dangerous. The best course seemed to be to approach the question from the wider standpoint of the general world crisis. For that reason the British delegation at Geneva had insisted on making as wide as possible the terms of reference of the various committees which it had been agreed to appoint.   They had explained both to
the French and other delegations that their hope was that these committees, like the Dawes Committee, in regard to reparations, might be able to throw a new-light on the economic crisis, or at least to diagnose the difficulties in an authoritative manner.(At this point the Governor of the Bank of England came in.)The Prime Minister summarised the discussion which had been taking place, and emphasised the risk of the present situation and the difficulty of finding any positive course of action which would not make matters worse. He invited the-Governor to express his views.The Governor said that he had not been present at the preceding discussions,, but he assumed that the Germans had come to explain that they could not continue to pay reparations.Dr. Briining and Dr. Curtius dissented, and explained that they had come merely to explain the difficulties as they saw them. They would certainly continue to execute the Young plan as long as possible. They could not help feeling, however, that the time vras approaching when they would have to take advantage of the safeguards in the plan, and they felt bound to communicate this feeling, in a spirit of loyalty, to the British Ministers. Dr. Curtius also observed that, so far as awaiting a favourable moment for approaching the United States was concerned, Germany could not possibly wait so long as eighteen months.The Governor said that they were no doubt preparing the way for the future. He wished, however, to emphasise that the immediate danger point was not Germany, but the south-east of Europe. He had been on the previous day in almost constant telephone communication with Basle and Vienna, and he regarded the situation in Austria as being exceedingly critical. Unless everybody could be got to co-operate in the work of reconstruction, there wrould be a catastrophe. The matter would have to be settled during the course of the next few days, but if a catastrophe occurred, it would not be confined to Austria; the trouble would inevitably spread to the neighbouring countries, and particularly to Germany. The immediate thing, therefore, was to get through the present Austrian crisis, and it was most desirable to do nothing that would disturb confidence further. He did not wish to belittle the difficulties of the&apos; German Government, but it was a less urgent problem. Germany had already gone through two or three financial crises which would have been fatal to any other country; she had shown a wonderful power of recuperation, and she might wrell get through again. He did not believe that any good could be done by raising the question of reparations at Geneva. America would not be ripe for a discussion of reparations for twelve months or &quot;more; and any League Committee which raised the question would merely antagonise opinion in America.Sir Robert Vansittart then pointed out that America wrould not be ripe for a discussion of reparations for much longer than twelve months; indeed, on present showing, the question could not be touched with any prospect of other than bad results until after the elections of November year, i.e., much more like two years.Mr. Henderson said he thought that opinion in America was changing, and instanced a recent speech in which Senator Borah advocated the cancellation of debts. The situation of Europe was very serious, and it had to be faced. He asked whether the Government were to regard themselves as helpless and to sit with folded arms watching events.The Governor agreed that the situation in Europe was certainly critical, and he doubted whether the Geneva Committees could do anything. But he felt sure that if there were fresh shocks to confidence, the committees would have not to diagnose the difficulties of Europe, but to conduct a post-mortem on the corpse.The Prime Minister said that the credit aspects of the present situation were very serious and deserved the fullest consideration by the German Government. They had, of course, their political difficulties at home, but they might be buying a [167 n-1] b 2
political respite at too high a price if they took action which ruined the credit of GeiTnany. As they knew, nothing could be done by the British Government alone, and they must await Mr. Stimson&apos;s visit to find out the American position.Sir R. Vansittart suggested that there was really little to be hoped for, or at least counted on, from that visit; Mr; Stimson could achieve few conversions, even if he were not too alarmed to be converted himself.The Prime Minister then asked whether the German Ministers had yet approached the French, and he suggested that .they should arrange to have a cordial and frank exchange of views with French Ministers just in the same way as they were now having them with British Ministers.Dr. Briining replied that they had already had this question before them. Quite privately he could say that, early in May, he received a message from M. Briand suggesting a meeting. He had replied from Badenweiler that he and Dr. Curtius would readily agree to such a meeting. The next day the emissary from M. Briand came back and said that M. Briand was sorry, but the meeting could not conveniently be arranged. He asked that this episode should be kept quite secret, as obviously it would be very damaging to him in Germany if it were known that he had agreed to a meeting with the French Ministers and the French Ministers had not pursued the idea. In view of this it was quite impossible for him now to initiate any such meeting.Mr. Henderson suggested that the apparent change of attitude on the part of M. Briand was possibly due to the approach of the presidential elections, which had upset the political situation in France for weeks before it took place.Dr. Briining agreed that this might be the case, but it was very difficult for him to keep control in Germany if he could not hold out any hope. The people were in despair, and the growing power of the Nazis and&quot; Communists was a menace. If the elections had taken place last December instead of in September the situation would have been hopeless.Sir F. Leith-Ross said that he personally was convinced that there was no hope of any revision of the Young plan at present. The best hope for Germany was in the Geneva discussions; even though the Committee did not touch directly on reparations, they might materially help Germany if, for example, they secured a general reduction of tariffs. He deprecated the insistence of German Ministers that a crisis must come in November. It might well prove that the situation then was no worse than at present.(At this stage there was an adjournment, during which Sir Robert Vansittart brought up three telegrams Nos. 313, 314 and 315 from Sir Ronald Lindsay (copies attached with reply sent) (&apos;) reporting the unfavourable impression made on Washington by the manifesto issued in Berlin on the previous day.) (It was agreed that these telegrams should be read to the German Ministers.)The Prime Minister said that he had just received three important telegrams from Washington showing that the manifesto issued in Berlin yesterday, as reported by American newspapers, had made a very unfavourable impression in the United States, and was regarded as likely to affect Germany&apos;s credit in America seriously. He thought that in the spirit of frankness with which the -discussion was being conducted, the best course was to ask Sir Robert Vansittart to read out the telegrams in full.After the telegrams had been read, Dr. Briining said he could not understand why Washington should be so upset. The manifesto contained no reference to a moratorium at all; it merely repeated the declaration that both he and Dr. Curtius had already made several times in the Reichstag.The Prime Minister remarked that a published statement often made a much more serious impression than statements made in the course of a parliamentary speech.(&apos;) Not printed.
JVie Governor of the Bank of England said that the last passage, viz., &quot; that the economic and financial situation of the Reich inevitably compels the relief of Germany from the intolerable reparation obligations,&quot; was pretty emphatic. He had not seen this text before, and he could well understand the repercussions in America. It seemed to him that this declaration entirely altered the situation. He hoped very much that the German Government had not any more surprises like this to spring during the next few weeks.Dr. Curtius said that there were no more manifestos in preparation.The Prime Minister said that he did not think they could carry matters further. It would be necessary to issue a communique to the press and they would have to give their French friends and the Italians an account of the discussion which had taken place. He suggested that Dr. Curtius and the German Ambassador should prepare a draft communique&quot; with Sir Robert Vansittart and Sir F. Leith-Ross.Dr. Curtius quite agreed to this procedure. As regards communication with the French and Italians, he had no objection, but he would prefer that no reference should be made to the fact that the German Government expected difficulties next November. It seemed to him that a declaration on this point would come better direct from the German Government.Mr. Henderson referred to the use of the word &quot; conference &quot; in connexion with the present conversation. He had explained the whole thing personally to M. Briand, who had expressed himself as quite satisfied, and he trusted that the communique would make the informal character of the meeting quite clear.The Prime Minister said that the French press seemed to have understood the position and to be taking quite a sensible line.Dr. Curtius said that he had seen the representatives of the French press on the previous day and had reiterated that the visit was primarily a social one and that no decisions were expected.A draft communique was prepared and, after considerable discussion, during which the Governor of the Bank again emphasised the inadvisability of any reference to a moratorium, the communique was agreed in the following terms : &apos;&apos; During the week-end the German Chancellor, Dr. Bruning, and the German Foreign Minister, Dr. Curtius, visited Chequers.&apos;&apos; The British Ministers present were the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and the President of the Board of Trade.&quot; On Sunday the Prime Minister and Miss MacDonald gave a luncheon, at which were present : &quot; Mr. and Mrs. Henderson, Mr. William Graham (President of the Board of Trade), the German Ambassador and Baroness von Neurath, Sir Clive Wigram (private secretary to the King) and Lady Wigram, Mr. Montagu Norman (governor of the Bank of England), Mr. and Mrs. George Bernard Shaw, Sir Robert Vansittart (Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office), Sir F. Leith-Ross (Treasury), Mr. and Mrs. A. V. Alexander, Herr Schmidt (interpreter), Count Bernstorff (German Embassy), Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, Miss Sheila MacDonald and Miss Byvoets (housekeeper at No. 10, Downing Street),&quot; The visit was arranged several months ago as a means of establishing personal contacts. The opportunity of this informal meeting was taken for a friendly talk on the position in which the German Reich and other industrial States now find themselves.&quot; Special stress was laid by the German Ministers on the difficulties of the existing position in Germany and the need for alleviation.
&quot; The British Ministers for their part called attention to the world-wide-character of the present depression and its special influence on their own country.&quot; Both parties were agreed that, in addition to efforts and measures of a national character, the revival of confidence and prosperity depended upon international co-operation.&apos;&apos; In this spirit both Governments will endeavour to deal with the present crisis in close collaboration with the other Governments concerned.&quot;
