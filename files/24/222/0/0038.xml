THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERMMEM!).CABINET.SECRET. COPY NO.     -5&quot;3.P.18801 ).LONDON   PASSENGER   transport bill.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.After twenty-nine days1 proceedings. Counsel finished his concluding address for the Bill before the Joint Committee of both Houses on Friday, the 17th instant, and we succeeded in inducing the Committee to meet on Monday, 20th July, at 5 o&apos;clock in the afternoon to give their decision on Preamble.The Committee decided that the Bill may proceed, subject to certain alterations.     On all the main features of the Bill the Committee have accepted our proposals.They have accepted the proposed composition of the Board and rejected the alternative scheme put forward by the London County Council.     I suggested that the clause might be amended, if the Committee wished, so as to provide for a minimum term of appointment of 3 years for Members of the Board, and this the Committee have agreed.They have also accepted the proposal to bring the Metropolitan Railway fully into the ownership of the Board and to compel them to accept the Board&apos;s stock in consideration for the transfer of their undertaking.     The Metropolitan Railway demanded cash and contended strongly that they were a main line railway and should be treated like the main lines.During the progress of the Bill, as my colleagues are aware, I neogtiated financial settlements with the Underground Group and with the London County Council.     These, together with the settlements with one or two other local authorities., are endorsed by the Committee, and will be ratified In the Act.
On the arbitration clause the Committee, in the course of their proceedings, indicated that they would desire certain directions to the arbitrator, which in their view limited his discretion, to he struck out, and they have now asked that a further amendment to the clause should he made to the effect that the Arbitration Tribunal, in dealing with the case of any remaining undertakings which comes before them,  should have regard to the settlements already effected.     Proposals will be submitted to the Committee to give effect to their views, although the matter is not free from difficulty.An&apos; alteration in the Bill, which I regard as an improvement, consists in a modification of the area of the Board&apos;s operations.      There was no alternative in framing the Bill but to adept the administrative area known as the London Traffic Area, but this has new been adjusted to a new line, which has direct regard to the traffic situation and has enabled me to make a satisfactory arrangement with the large provincial omnibus companies operating on the outskirts of the London area. I was at the same time able to negotiate satisfactory financial terms for the acquisition of certain services within the Board&apos;s area which will be taken over by the Board.     The through coach business from points outside the area will not of course be interfered with.Another direction in which I have been able to consolidate    the basis of the Bill, and to move towards a fuller co-ordination of transport, is the scheme for pooling the passenger receipts of the Board and    those of the main lines in respect of their passenger suburban services.     The Bill as introduced made such an arrangement possible if it could be agreed, or at my discretion.      I have been able to negotiate a scheme under which a pool will be definitely established on an
agreed basis, in which not only the main lines but the Underground Group have fully concurred.      I hope that this arrangement will inorease the-confidence and stability of the main lines and enable them to face their suburban problems in a progressive spirit,  for which we could not reasonably look while they were exposed to intensive road competition.      The effect of this arrangement on the prospect of further electrification must be beneficial.I do not think that I need refer to certain minor matters in which the Committee have somewhat restricted the powers sought for the Board and which are not in any way vital to its success.      But I regret to report that the Committee decided to strike out the power to manufacture.      In view of the previous decisions of the Cabinet, this was not a matter in which I felt able to offer any compromise, but I still hope to induce the Committee to give the Board power to manufacture the bodies of motor vehicles,as is now being done on a very substantial scale by the London General Omnibus Company.In general, the decision of the Committee is extremely favourable to the Bill,There is however a difficulty about time-table.     The Committee met on the 2Jrd July in accordance with their announcement to proceed with clauses., but violent objection was raised by Counsel for the London County Council and other interests which Indicates a desire to obstruct the Bill, and if possible to defeat it on time-table, now that the objections to Preamble have failed.     My Counsel resisted a proposal to adjourn till the autumn and the Committee, after deliberating, decided to meet on Monday, the 27th, and the Lord Chairman indicated his hope that they would finish their labours before Parliament rises next week.      Every effort will be made to
secure this but the task is a heavy one and of course I hav no control over the Committee.      I shall be in a better position to report on this point at the meeting of the Cabinet.(Initialled)   H.M,25/7/51-
