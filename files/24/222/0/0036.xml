DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT. RET..186(31).CABINET. Rent Restrictions.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I desire to draw the attention of my colleagues tothe Report (Gmd.3911) of the Committee on the Rent RestrictionsActs, appointed in accordance with the decision of the Cabinetcontained in 0.46(30) conclusion 15.     The Committee are unanimous,with the exception of Mr. Duncan Graham, M.P., who submits a minority report.     It will be remembered that all parties in theHouse were represented on the Committee.Summary of recommendations of Committee other thanMr.Duncan Graham.The Committee take the view that the question ofcontinuance of control for different sections of the communitymust depend on the facts of the housing situation for each section,and in Parts III and IV of their Report they embody an importantstatistical review of the housing position.     They state that their main conclusions flow from the premiss   that decontrol of any classof house is dependent on whether the shortage in that class has been,or is rapidly being, overtaken.     They find that for the workingclasses the shortage in many districts is still acute, whereas for^other classes it has been or is being overtaken.     Accordingly they recommend that the more expensive houses (designated for convenienceGlass A) should be decontrolled forthwith, and that, as regards theremainder, the decontrolling provisions of the Act of 1923 shouldcontinue to apply to the more highly rented houses (Class B) but should cease to apply to the lower rented houses (Class C.)     For the copy NO,
purposes of tlieir recommendations the Committee propose to classify houses at present within the scope of the Acts by reference to Rateable Value as at April last, as follows:-Metropolitan Police District.Class A.    45 or overClass B.    Over  20 but under  45.Class C    20 or under.Rest of England and Wales. 35 or over.Over  13 but under  35. 13 or underScotland. 45 or over,Over  26.5 but under  45. 26.5. or under.Recommendations are also made in regard to other important - though minor - aspects of the inquiry,  including proposals to minimise the abuses of sub-letting, and to amend and simplify the lav/ in regard to obtaining possession in order -inter alia - to secure that important schemes of development are not hampered or prevented.     The Committee have refrained from adopting various suggestions for amending the Acts in points of detail, in view of the large number of legal decisions given on the Acts, and have confined their recommendations to the remedying of substantial hardship or injustice.   They do, however, recommend consolidation of the Acts at an early date.Class A. Houses.The Committee are satisfied that a shortage no longer exists in this class and recommend, therefore, that such houses should be decontrolled forthwith.     They point out that the effect of their proposal would be to bring outside the scope of the Acts about 900,000 houses.     They estimate that the houses already decontrolled, together with new (uncontrolled) houses, constitute a clear majority of all the houses in the class, and suggest that the continuance of control in the interests of a minority of occupiers must be to the detriment of the majority in that it artificially
restricts the amount, and so raises the price, of the accommodation in the market.     They further point out that in vie?; of the great amount of new building in this class of house, there is no reason to anticipate that owners will be able to exact scarcity rents.Glass B. Houses^.The Committee point out that a large proportion of the houses built by private enterprise - nearly 70,000 were built in the six months ended 31st March last - are of this type, and are occupied mainly by a class consisting, at one end of the scale, of artisans, and, at the other end, of less/paid members of the middle classes, while a large number of municipal tenants have been, and are being, drawn from this class of occupier.     For this class of house, therefore, they consider that gradual decontrol is desirable and recommend that the decontrolling provisions of the Act of 1923 should continue to apply.Class C. -Houses.The limits for this class are, generally speaking, the existing limits of rateable value for the compulsory compounding of rates and are taken as affording the best available rough definition of a real working class house.     The Committee point out (in paragraphs 47 and, 48 of the Report) that only about one-eighth of such houses have become decontrolled;    that the partial decontrol has caused a great deal of friction and some hardship;    that the rents charged on decontrol are in some cases very high;    and that, in this class, the present system of decontrol, combined with the shortage, has an immobilising effect.     They consider that, in relation
to this olass of house, the decontrolling system introduced by the Act of 1923 has not effected its principal objects, viz: to secure a gradual return to normal conditions without friction and to stimulate building by private enterprise,     They accordingly recommend that the decontrolling provisions of the Act of 1923 should cease to apply to, and that the new Act should place no time limit on the control of, houses of this class.The broad effect of the recommendations as to Class C. houses is to reproduce the pre-1923 position and to put the control back again on the house instead of on the tenancy.Mortgages.The Committee recommend that mortgages should remain controlled so long as the mortgaged properties are controlled; and, further, that control of mortgages on&apos; Class A houses should remain in force for six months after the date for decontrol of these houses.The permitted increase in rent and the enforcement of repairs.The present permitted increase and the factors taken into account in its calculation are submitted to a careful analysis in paragraphs 59 - 65 of the report.     The Committee find themselves unable to recommend any alteration of the permitted increase, but recommend that every practicable step should be taken to secure that the landlord does his duty in keeping the properties in good and tenantable repair.     They make certain proposals which are designed to secure that tenants may be made more aware of their legal right to have th^ir houses kopt in . proper repair.
Recovery of Possession.The Committee consider that Parliament should not concern itself with the reason why a landlord desires to recover possession:   provided that suitable alternative accommodation is available for the tenant, and that the full discretion of the Court is retained to take account of all the circumstances   in considering whether it is reasonable that the tenants should move. They recommend that the law should be simplified accordingly.   In addition, they propose a slight extension of the definition of alternative accommodation and, in order to ease the difficulties of an-owner bona fide wanting his house for his own occupation suggest that the rights given to such owners by the Prevention of Eviction Act, 1924, should extend to owners who have bought houses up to the date of the Report, which should be substituted for the date (5th May* 1924) fixed by that Act.Sub-letting.The Committee recognize the existence of abuses in unregulated sub-letting, but conclude that it would be worse than useless to suggest a remedy that would drastically restrict sub-letting, which, so long as a housing shortage remains, manifestly will and should continue.    While rejecting suggestions made by certain witnesses as over-elaborate or otherwise objectionable, they recommend that statutory tenants should be required to notify their landlords if they are sub-letting;   that, in certain cases, extortionate charging shall be an offence;    and that the landlord should have the right to apply for possession on the ground of a tenant1s extortionate charge to a sub-tenant and the Court be empowered at discretion to grant possession and to fix the sub-tenant&apos;s rent payable to the tenant or the landlord as the case may be,The Committee received some evidence&apos;of profiteering in the letting of furnished rooms in certain areas, but find themselves in agreement with the conclusions of the earlier
GSalisbury Committee that effective control which involves for-bidding eviction, cannot practically be applied to furnished lettings.     They are accordingly unable to recommend further statutory provision to deal with the point.Rent Courts.The Committee draw attention to the essential difference between the system which has been established in this country under which rents have to conform to a nationally enacted standard, the jurisdiction of the Courts being confined to matters of interpretation, etc., and the system which has been established in some other countries where rent contracts are ratified and fair rents are settled according to individual circumstances by special Rent Courts.     They point out that the British system is not one on which the system of Rent Courts could easily or appropriately be grafted, and that the County and Sheriff Courts which administer the Acts have by now gained great experience and knowledge of the Acts and commend general confidence.     In these circumstances they do not consider that the establishment of any new judicial tribunal such as a Rent Court is either necessary or desirable, but they recommend that local authorities should be empowered to appoint committees for the purpose of giving advice on questions arising under the Acts. The question is fully discussed in paragraphs 97 - 99 of the Report.Minority Report ^hy Mr. Duncan Graham. Mr. Duncan Graham differs from his colleagues on various points of principle.   He recommends a figure of  60 pre-war rent, excluding rates, as the figure above which decontrol should be allowed in Scotland;   he considers that, below this figure,
(Intld.)   A.G.Ministry of Health. 24th July, 1931.all decontrolled houses should be brought back under control, and that control should be extended to all post-war houses including municipal hoxises;    he disagrees with the view that the permitted increase of rent should  be continued;   he recommends that no alteration should be made in the lav/ as to the recovery of possession, and that the question of Rent Courts should be further explored.Decision as to action to be taken on Beport.A considerable number of resolutions on the subject of Rent Restriction have been put down for discussion at the Party Conference in October next.     It will be extremely difficult to dispose of these resolutions by simple reference to the Report of the Committee, since we shall, not unreasonably, be asked, not what is in the Report but what are the intentions of the Government in regard to it.     In view of the uncertainty as to Cabinet arrangements during the Parliamentary Secess, I have thought it safest to bring the question to the Cabinet before we adjourn for the Recess and I shall be glad of Cabinet authority to state that our intention is to include legislation in our programme for next year.     The basis of the legislation would be the recommendations of the. majority of the Committee, subject to detailed consideration of them by the Cabinet at a later stage when time admits of it.
