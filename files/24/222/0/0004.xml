In the event or the Cabinet accepting the proposed local machinery for the effective control of the inland distribution and consumption of coal,  the Departmental Committee consider that for the reasons set out in paragraph 7 of their Report, it in essential to enlist tho so-epera-tion of ooal owners and secure their membership of th* district Coal Emergency Committees^      The -Question thon arises wh.ei.her the c^-operation of the Miners&apos; Federation and possibly of other Trade Unions concerned should not also be ceeured by informing them, in advance, of the Government1s proposals, This question is one-of policy and is for the decision of the Cabinet.. While the Committee feelthat consultation with the Trade Unions might havebeneficial results in removing misunderstanding andcreating a better atmosphere, they feel bound to remind the Cabinet that the proposed machinery is designed forthe purpose of securing the conservation and equitable distribution of supplies of coal rihich has already bednprod\icod, and will be in no way concerned with the actualproduction of ooal;    that the control of the machinerywill be in the hands of the Government;    and that thefunctions of the eoal owners on tho Emergency committees will be of a purely advisory nature.The Committee recemmend thy Cabinet -(a)    To accept the following recemmendatienscontained in the Departmental Committee&apos;s Reports -(i) That the Secretary for Mines should be authorised at once, to take preliminary and confidential steps for obtaining frcm the coal owners nominees to serve cn District Coal Emergency Committeesu

J.R.C.Home Office.13th June,  1931.
SECRET.. HOME OFFICE,13th June? 1931-ToThe Right Honourahle J.R. dynes. Mo P. ,II.M.  Secretary of State for the &quot;Home Department.Sir 3In accordance with your directions, I have convened a meeting of representatives of the Departments concerned with the object of ascertaining what steps would be necessary to   bring into full working order the Supply and Transport Organisation and what this would involve in the way of consultation with persons outside the Government Service and consequent risk of publicitjr.      As a results I have the honour to present the following report.2.    It will be convenient to deal with the matter separately from the point of view of two possible contingencies, viz. 9  (a)  a partial or complete coal stoppage, and (b)  an emergenc&apos;y involving general inter*-ference with transport in the docks, on the railways or on the roads.(a) Coal Stoppage. 3.    So far as regards the setting up of special machinery a coal stoppage would be almost exclusively a matter of concern to the Mines Department.    A complete stoppage would certainly necessitate a proclamation of emergency under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920. and the. issue of Emergency Regulations.     This, however, does not call for immediate consideration and the Cabinet can rely on being informed in ample time if, in the opinion of-1-
Department, it should &quot;become necessary to. take a.- decis-lon on the matter.4.    The question of more immediate importance is what steps should be talc en now to set up the machinery which would be required by the Mines Department.      The object of this machinery is to enable the Mines Department, to take the best possible steps for conserving such supplies of coal as may be available and ensuring that in the distribution of such supplies priority is given to services essential to the life of the community.5.    The central machinery comprises (i)  a Central Coal Emergency Committee to deal with general coal queBt-,ixm.s-requiring co-ordinated action and (ii) a Shipment Sub-Committee for the control of coal exports and bunkers.    The latter would work through local Committees at Glasgow, Liverpool. Cardiff. Hull and Newcastle-on-Tyne.    The central machinery is complete;    th.3 f3h.ipm.ent Sub-Committees consistof representatives of Government Departments and of the ccs.II owners;    the Committees are complete except for the representation of the coal owners who have not yet been approached.      This can. if necessary, be left until the proclamation of emergency is made.6.    In addition, certain local machinery,., constitutor, from the trade, is required for the effective control of the inland distribution and consumption of coal.7.    In each coal-producing area it is contemplated that there will be a District Coal Emergency Committee of coal owners, factors and merchants, who will be responsible for the disposal of coal from the collieries in the area and any other bulk supplies made available to them by the Mines Department.      A representative of the Mines Department, will be attached to each Committee as its Chief Executive Officer.      It is considered essential to enlist the co-opera tion of coal-owners and to secure their membership of the District Coal Emergency Committees.      Without this, the limit-supplies of coal available at the pits are likely to be
9 o 60dissipated for unessential purposes..with the result that shortages for essential services are likely to he experienced sooner than would otherwise occur,8, If the organisation is to he in effective operation by 8th July, it is essential that preliminary and confidential steps for constituting these Committees should begin to be taken at once.    This recommendation raises questions of policy in regard to its possible reactions on the negotiations now in progress.    These questions are dealt with in the Secretary for Mines&apos; memorandum of 28th April (C.S.S.(3l) 6). In the present report I am concerned only with, the practical steps necessary to complete the emergency organisation and I must make it clear that,, if these steps are not taken at once., the organisation required to enable the Mines Department to carry out its emergency duties will not be ready by 8th July.9. It is also contemplated that in each local authority&apos;s area there will be Committees of Coal Merchants whose duty it will be to ascertain the position of stocks in the hands of merchants and assist in securing that the distribution of available supplies is made in accordance with the directions of the Mines Department.    These Committees will work under the general supervision of the Coal Emergency Officers, who are civil servants.    It is not, however, considered essential that the coal merchants should be approached in advance of a proclamation of emergency with a view to their serving on these Committees.(b). Dock or other Transport Stoppage.10. For the purposes of an emergency affecting transport there has been in the past a more elaborate organisation, composed for the most part of persons In the Government and municipal services, but including for some purposes persons
outside such services and&apos; involving consultation with outside persons.11*  This organisation still exists,  though in part only on paper.    Broadly speaking, the -present position is that it could he brought into full operation at about thx4ee weeks7 notice.    This would however involve some risk of publicity if certain gaps v/hich now exist were to be filled up at the present time.12.  The centre of the organisation consisted of a Cabinet Committee, presided over by the Home Secretary and comprising the Ministers chiefly concerned which, subject to reference to the Cabinet where necessary, determined all questions of policy.    For the carrying out of policy there was a Standing Sub-Committee of departmental representatives presided over by a Minister with the title of Chief Civil Commissioner.13.  The Chief Civil Commissioner had a smalls taff of civil servants and offices at Whitehall Gardens.    Under him were a number of Civil Commissioners,  junior members of the-Government, to each of whom was assigned a part of England and Wales.    In times of emergency the Civil Commissioners went to prearranged Headquarters in their several districts and were provided with staffs consisting of representatives of the Departments concerned withessential services and, in some cases, representatives of other organisations, e.g.; -..... &apos;railway companies and canal associations.    Their functions were to coordinate local services and the local operation of national services andi n particular to supervise the arrangements fOr the enrolment of voluntary labour for essential services.14.  The organisation for Scotland was similar with the important difference that the officers (known as District Commissioners and five in number) corresponding to Civil
Commissioners were not Government Servants,,      They arc essential to the organisations, and it could not &quot;be re-established in less    than 3 weeks: longer time would be required if action were postpone.! until after the occurrence -of an emergency,,15o      So much of the organisation as has been described could be set up with no risk of publicity, but to complete the further steps necessary to bring it into a state of full efficiency would involve consultation with a substantial number of persons outside the   ^Government Service,  and it would not be prudent to assume that this could be done without any publicity,,      I refer in particular to the steps which would be required to re-establish the organisation for the recruitment tf voluntary labour, affecting some 100 persons^16c    The Mines Department consider that., while good rather than harm would be done by taking the coal owners- into consultation, if it were to become generally known that the Government is preparing for an emergency the negotiations now proceeding- v/ould be gravely prejudiced,,170    The question is therefore whether there is anyprobability of any other serious dispute   coinciding with a coal stoppage.      I am informed by the Ministry of Labour serious that the only/risk of dispute affecting the emergency organisation is in regard to the Docks and that a stoppage is not   likely to occur in the docks in the early stage of a coal stoppage so far as can be forseen at presents though there is some risk of loss of temper and consequent breakdown of negotiations if certain of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance are put into operation,,18,    In these circumstances I should be prepared to advise that the Government should take the risk of being- 5-- 1
aaagbt-. cnJ^pautially prepared- by annaj-or:.*msx5g-exicy ..jproride-d . that all action which can be taken without danger of publicity is taken forthwith.19.    It is accordingly recommended that, in addition to the action recommended in paragraph 8 for the purposes of the completion cf the Mines Department organisation., the following action should be taken at once -(1)  a Supply and Transport Committee of the Cabinet should be set up and the Departmental Standing Sub-Committee should be re-established. (2)  a Chief Civil Commissioner should be appointed and invited to confer with you as to the appointment of Civil Commissioners. (3) five District Commissioners should be appointed for Scotland, (4) any necessary action of a purely departmentalnature should be completed under the authority of Ministers.20.      If these recommendations are approved I would propose that a more comprehensive report on the state of the organisa-tion,  indicating the measures which require to be taken to bring it up to date, should be submitted to.the Cabinet Committee.21..      I would only add that, if a coal stoppage should unfortunately occur on 8th July,  I consider that opportunity should then be taken forthwith to bring the organisation into a state of complete preparedness.     As pointed out sbove this cannot be done now without some risk of publicity but considerations of this kind would not arise after an emergency had occurred.I have, etc.,(Sgd.)  JOES! ANDERSON.
