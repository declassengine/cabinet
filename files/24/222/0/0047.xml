Cabinet by ctirecWoia of the  Secretary oi Slate for Foreign Affairs this document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;s government &apos;GERMANY.VERY SECRET.July 31, 1931.Section 1.[C 5893/2018/18] No. 1.Record of a Meeting at the Reichskanzlei, Berlin, on July 28, 1931. (Received Jidy 31.)A MEETING took place this morning at the Reichskanzlei .at which the following were present: Chancellor Briining. The Prime Minister.Dr. Curtius. * Mr. Arthur Henderson.Herr Dieckhoff. Sir Walford Selby.Dr. Schmidt. Mr. Nevile Butler.Opening the conversation, Mr. MacDonald referred to the unemployment situation in England. He said that there had been an increase of 19,000 in the number of unemployed this week. Although these were not real figures, the question of unemployment generally was a serious one, and he felt that both we and the Germans were in for a difficult winter.Dr. Briining said that he had spoken to Mr. Graham at Chequers about coal and coke problem. As it affected the question of iron and steel exports that position had become very dangerous, and he felt that some agreement between the two countries was desirable. The German interests were coneen-trated in a syndicate, but he believed that that was not the case in England, and that we had nothing at present in the nature of a central control representing all interests, like the German Coal Syndicate.Mr. MacDonald said that his attention had also been drawn to this question. There was a pit employing 2,000 in his constituency which had recently gone out of action on account of competition from abroad. The position was that British coal and coke interests were now organising themselves under the new Coal Mines Act, and he said that he would speak to Mr. Graham with a view to this organisation being hurried up.Mr. Henderson thought that the best plan would be for Mr. Graham to be informed in order that he might take the problem up in the course of his visit to Geneva. Mr. Henderson also referred to the question of the International Convention for Uniform Hours in the Mining Industry. The question which arose was when His Majesty&apos;s Government, Germany and Poland would be ready to put it into operation. The matter had been mentioned in course of the discussions which had recently taken place with the miners and coal-owners. Mr. Henderson said that he thought that the owners and men could be got to agree if Germany and Poland could be induced to subscribe to the Geneva Convention as regards hours.Dr. Briining then referred to the question of Russian bills of exchange. He said he thought it was of the utmost importance that an agreement should be reached as to the way in which those bills should &apos;be discounted so that the various countries should not enter into competition. By this means under-bidding-would be prevented and an evil remedied. He thought that the Bank of International Settlements might possibly be used to secure international co-operation in this question and to suggest a rate. The question of credits to Russia had been discussed at Chequers; the two questions might be linked up. If France, Germany and Great Britain could reach an agreement on the question of discounting Russian notes of exchange it might be possible to bring in Poland, Italy and Czechoslovakia, who must also be included.Dr. Curtius observed that, in his opinion, the most important point was that the German Government should first come to an agreement with England on this question.  The question had been discussed at Chequers, and he thought that the[194 hh-1] b
organisations in the two countries dealing with this matter were already in touch, but, as regards an agreement, Dr. Curtius said that he thought it was of great importance that it should be so contrived as not to appear as if it were directed against Russia. As a matter of fact, it was Russia herself who was at present under a disadvantage as regards the competition which existed. Dr. Curtius said that he had recently spoken to the French on the matter, who had also shown themselves interested in it; he repeated, however, that it was desirable for Germany and England to come to an agreement first.Dr. Briining asked how far negotiations with our Board of Trade had got in this matter.   The reply was given that only contacts had been made so far.Dr. Bruning then referred to special steels, and the Prime Minister said that it had been agreed at Chequers that this question should be discussed not through officials but privately. Sir Arthur Balfour feared that the large Russian imports of these steels were due to a desire to develop armaments; he and Dr. Briining agreed in thinking that this was not the case; there had been very small imports of high speed steel into Russia in the course of the last three years, and the reasonable view was that the Russians were doing no more than make up depleted stocks.Mr. MacDonald said that that was also the opinion of the authorities in England. It was true, though, that suspicion had been aroused by the fact that the Russians were paying big prices in cash for imports of wolfram and other similar metals. His Majesty&apos;s Government were also rather anxious in regard to the development of illegitimate competition, which was developing in certain countries, and he instanced the case of Italy, which was subsidising its ship-building, on rather illegitimate lines. This was a competition which neither Germany nor Great Britain could stand for very long. Mr. MacDonald also mentioned the French system of giving loans, coupled with a condition as regards orders in return. There had been the case of a recent loan to Latvia for 2-  millions, of which, according to the press, If millions should be re-spent in purchases in France. Such systems only had the effect of forcing and accelerating competition and of dragging Governments in as parties. Mr. MacDonald observed that if financial power was used by nations in this way, it must inevitably lead to catastrophe for all.Resuming the points which had arisen, Mr. MacDonald said the two important things were that of coal and coke, to be discussed at Geneva, and the question of Russian credits, on both of which he would speak to Mr. GrahamDr. Curtius then referred to the meeting of the Co-ordinating Committee of the Committee of European Union, which had been called, as at present arranged, for the 26th August, and said that he thought it was too early a date. It was impossible that they could remain at Geneva from the 26th August to the 3rd October. He suggested that the meeting of the Co-ordinating Committee should take place on the 29th August, and that that day and the following day, the 30th, should be reserved for the meeting of the Co-ordinating Committee and the early days of the following week be taken up with the meetings of the Council and of the Committee of European Union. If the Prime Minister and Mr. Henderson agreed, he was ready to telegraph to Geneva to suggest postpone-ment of the meeting of the Co-ordinating Committee to the 29th August.Mr. Henderson said that he was in entire agreement with Dr. Curtius and had already mentioned the point to the Secretary-General.Dr Briining said that in the conversations which had taken place in Paris reference had been made to the constitution of a customs union for the countries of the old Danubian Monarchy. This would be entirely unacceptable from the German point of view. He said that he had talked to Sir Walter Layton on the subject and that Sir Walter Layton had also reviewed the position with Herr Lammers. No such arrangements would assist to alleviate the position unless tariffs were simultaneously reduced, and Dr. Briining said he was of opinion that in this matter they should proceed according to a definite plan which might be extended, say, over a period of eight years. He thought that the best plan would be that a discussion should take place between the representatives -of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the German representatives, the essential consideration being that duties must be lowered.Mr. Henderson observed that in the discussions, which had taken place in the Economic Committee at Geneva there had been no agreement on the French scheme. .
Mr. MacDonald added that the German representatives and ourselves could discuss the question with a view, to endeavouring to discover a common course of action. So far as he had been able to examine Sir Walter Layton&apos;s scheme he thought the idea a very good one.Mr. MacDonald said there was one question of importance which he would like to mention, and it was that of the continued negotiations between France and Germany. He was very anxious to have the view of the German Ministers and he felt sure they would not mind the question being put to them. Did it suit them that these conversations should be continued between the two parties without our intervention, or would they prefer that we should intervene ? He would remind them that His Majesty&apos;s Government were interested politically and it would not do for a settlement to be reached and that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be faced with a fait accompli. In this connexion Mr. MacDonald referred to the American-French agreement which had been reached in Paris between M. Laval and Mr. Mellon, which had proved very embarrassing to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Mr. MacDonald enquired Avhether the German Ministers had thought how they would like the conversations to develop. Did they wish to go on together, and at what point did they think that other Powers should be invited to participate?Dr. Curtius replied that he had not yet been able to discuss this with Dr. Briining, but his personal view was that the conversations should for the present continue between France and Germany only. There was the idea of inviting the French Ministers to come to Berlin for the purpose of further discussions before the meeting of the Assembly at Geneva in September, but the Rome visit, which must take place first, had also to be taken into consideration. Dr. Curtius said he did not see how any practical solution could be reached as a result of direct conversations with the French, but he thought it Was necessary to show the French that the German Ministers were ready to discuss matters with them directly. He was of opinion that as soon as the discussions had been a little further developed His Majesty&apos;s Government should be informed and they could then consider together whether to extend the conversations to other Powers as well. The fact that the German Government had shown them-selves to be at the disposal of the French for the purpose of direct talks with them had unquestionably brought an alleviation into the political atmosphere.Mr. MacDonald said that he had no intention of pressing the point at present, but if the conversations reached a certain point he thought it desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be informed.Mr. Henderson said that he had told Dr. Brtining when at Chequers that, if the German Government would keep them informed of developments in the relations with France, it might be possible for us to make useful suggestions, and then would arise the possibility of enlarging the scope of the discussions.Dr. Briining said that it was essential that the British should join in the conversations at a point.. Mr. MacDonald then raised the question how to continue the work which had been begun in London. The experts were now on the spot in Germany, and Mr. MacDonald said that he had at once communicated the documents relating to the London Conference to the Bank for International Settlements and had received a very cordial reply. In a little while it would be possible to see what effect had been produced by the decisions in London in Germany itself, but there was much to be done and it was necessary to take a broad view in regard to the future, since serious problems were involved. There was the question of repara-tions and war debts. He would tell the German Ministers in confidence that it was his intention to spend a few days with Mr. Stimson in August in Scotland. While there, other American public men would be present, leaders of the Democratic party among them, and he said he proposed to raise informally with them the question as to what would happen at the end of the twelve months&quot; moratorium conceded by President Hoover. If all went well, Mr. MacDonalcI said that he thought it was expedient that there should be another discussion before the termination of the twelve months under the Hoover moratorium. His Majesty&apos;s Government had taken the view that they could not support the French idea of a long credit for the reason that the only effect would be to pile up further commitments for Germany. In two years&apos; time it would only involve a more serious financial crisis than existed at the present moment. There were two [194 hh-1] b 2
difficulties which stood in the way of any reopening of the subjects of war debts and reparations, namely, the attitude of France and America, and, in connexion with the American attitude, the presidential election next year must not be lost sight of.Dr. Bruning said that the German Government had considered the possibility of something in the nature of a long-term credit based on the security of public utilities in Germany. If, however, they accepted the loan scheme proposed by the French Government the effect wTould be that the reparation question would be definitely settled against them. What the German Government really wanted for the time being was help to tide them over the present year.Mr. MacDonald said that, according to the calculations of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the German Government would have to pay in July 1933, if present conditions were perpetuated, something in the region of  10 million more than they would be paying under the normal operation of the Young Plan. That was an intolerable position, which was neither good for Germany nor for Europe.Dr. Bruning said that the Americans had emphasised the necessity of Germany buying more raw materials, especially cotton, as that would point to the success of President Hoover&apos;s initiative, as it was necessary for President Hoover to show his people some result for the action he had taken.Dr. Bruning said that as soon as he had been able to review the position generally and see more clearly the net effect of the measures which had already been taken, he would very much like to get into communication with His Majesty&apos;s Government with a view to co-ordinating further steps in the future with them. They were bound to recognise that the possibility of the reimposition of the Young plan would constitute a great danger for Germany.Mr. MacDonald made it clear that what he had just said about talking to Mr. Stimson must not be interpreted as anything in the nature of an official approach. The Americans were beginning to see that something had got to be done as they recognised themselves that the Hoover step was not an isolated one, and in this connexion Mr. MacDonald drew attention to an address which had been broadcast by Senator Ritchie in regard to the reaction of war debts on American trade. He regarded this address as of very great importance, as like-wise the attitude of Senator Borah who was supporting Mr. Hoover.Dr. Curtius said that he very much doubted whether the Americans would make any further move without some assurance as regards disarmament. He thought it probable that the American Government might agree to lengthen the period of the Hoover moratorium by one year so as to be able to review the progress which had been made in connexion with the forthcoming disarmament conference next year. The first step, in his opinion, was to discuss the possibility of the extension of the Hoover plan for a period of one more year, as that would give the necessary time for a full consideration of the whole problem. He doubted very much whether the American Government would agree to deal with the question of debts as a whole until after the presidential election. One solution which Dr. Curtius had in view was that a European body, composed of economic experts, should review the whole position in Europe and then inform the American Government that for purely economic reasons the extension of the Hoover plan by one year was essential. The greater the sum the French asked to be paid the clearer it would become that the Germans could not pay.Mr. Henderson intervened to remark that he feared the French memorandum on disarmament would not conduce to get the Americans to make a further contribution.Dr. Curtius replied that he had discussed this question with Mr. Stimson, who had said that in the course of the London Conference the French had put forward memorandum after memorandum setting forth their claims, but despite this a result had in the end been reached, and Mr. Stimson thought it would be possible to reach an agreement. Dr. Curtius had replied that the French memorandum had very considerably altered the position and had placed the German Government in a very difficult position. It was the duty of all to consider how best to mobilise public opinion against the memorandum.Dr. Bruning said that it had not been possible to have any discussion with the French in the course of the recent conversations and it must be admitted the time was not a happy one.  He drew attention to the declarations of M. Maginot
on the subject and mentioned how the French elections were impending. In his opinion the important thing was to tackle the questions relating to trade and the development of the work of the London Conference which had been raised at the beginning of the conversations, as a critical winter lay ahead.Dr. Curtius said it was the intention of the German representatives to present a memorandum of their ideas as regards disarmament.July 28, 1931.
