S DOCUMENT IS THE PROP STY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT . RET.. 199 (51) Copy No.CABINET.MR. BALDWIN^ PROPOSAL FOR A TARIFF COMMISSION.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1. The proposals made by Mr. Baldwin in his speech at Hull on the 17th July for the setting up of a permanent independent Tariff Commission raise some considerations of great importance to which I desire to invite the attention of my colleagues,2. The proposals, which must presumably be taken as formulating the official pplicy of the Conservative Party, are:-(a) immediately on coming into office to impose an&quot;Emergency General Tariff&quot; of which the principles have already been worked out:    and(b) to set up a permanent &quot;non-political&quot; TariffCommission &quot;upon whose recommendations tariff variations would &quot;be made, subject only to the consent of Parliament&quot;. As examples of the purposes for which such variations would be made, Mr, Baldwin instances the relieving of exporting industries adversely affected in competitive power by duties on their materials;    the prevention of profiteering;   and the giving of additional protection where the original rates of duty proved inadequete.     The reports of the Commission would be laid before Parliament and published, so that Parliament would have before it all the material necessary for a decision and the public would know all the grounds on which that decision had &quot;been taken.
3. The object of such a permanent Tariff   Commission is stated to be to take this &quot;scientific adjustment and adaptation of the tariff&quot; out of politics, so that the Government action may be founded on full and impartial information, available to the Government and every citizen, &quot;so that it is not being done in secret&quot;.     Should a Government decide at any time that the establishment of a tariff system Would be to the general economic advantage of this country it may be that some permanent and independent machinery of investigation, of the nature of a tariff commission or board, would be of substantial utility;   but that does not mean that thereby tariff issues could, or would, be taken out of politics.4. As Mr. Baldwin states that &quot;we have made a thorough study of the cut and build of Tariff Commissions and Tariff Boards^,_-set up by other countries, we have taken what was good in their experience, and deliberately provided against what we believed to be bad&quot;, I have thought it useful to give in Annex! to this memorandum some account of the structure and duties of the existing Commissions     and Boards in the United States of America, Australia, the Irish Free State,   the Union of South Africa and British India and of the Board which it is proposed to establish in Canada.5. It is expressly stated by Mr. Baldwin that the ultimate decision on the findings of the Commission is to rest with parliament.     Obviously it must be so if Parliamentary control of general tariff policy and of taxation is to be maintained; but if it is so maintained then experience so far shows that there is little likelihood that the declared purpose - the removal of tariff issues from the sphere of &quot;ordinary&quot; politics and making it &quot;impossible for a group of individuals to try to bring pressure to bear on Members of Parliament for getting this or that duty put on&quot; - will be achieved.
A Tariff Commission in various forms has been in operation for several years in the United States of America; the present one has very wide powers of enquiry into all tariff matters, on direction from the President or from either House, and it can enforce the disclosure of relevant information.     Its recommendations as to upward or downward revision (within limits) of the statutory rate of duty on any commodity can be put into operation by Presidential proclamation (this is the so-called &quot;flexible tariff&quot; system), but effect can be given to recommendations for transfers from the free to the dutiable list only by legislation.     The detailed reports of the Commission are published.     This system appears to be very much what Mr. Baldwin contemplates, except that all the recommendations of his commission will require some form of Parliamentary legislation.     But no student of American conditions would claim that the operations of the Tariff Commission have so far done very much to take tariff questions out of the field of American politics, or that it is an obstacle to sweeping general revisions of the tariff by legislative action determined as much as ever before by the political pressure and bargaining of sectional interests.A Tariff Board has also been in existence in the Commonwealth of Australia for a number of years.     It also was intended to be independent and the Minister of Customs is bound to refer to it inter alia all proposals for new, increased or reduced duties, and any question whether a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him.     The Mini ster may also refer to it such questions as the fiscal and industrial effects of ths Customs laws of the Commonwealth, the inci(fence between the rates of duty on raw materials and on finished or partly finished products and any other matter affecting the encouragement of primary and secondary industries in relation to the tariff.
The operations of that Board should have given to Australia a tariff of that scientific and impartially devised nature whioh Mr. Baldwin desires.     That It has not done so is common knowledge, and some of the reasons for this failure are clearly Indicated in the Annual Report of the Tariff Board for the year 1927-28. in which complaint is made that in regard to some of the most important subjects investigated eithar the Minister of the day or Parliament has seen fit to act otherwise than in accordance with the recommendation of the Board, and strong comment is made on the methods adopted by interested parties to obtain departures from the Board&apos;s recommendations.     It is asserted that the findings of the Board, reached after protracted and careful enquiry, have been set aside by the influence on Members of Parliament and the Government of a few men, parties to the application, and as the result of bargaining between interests.     The whole passage in the Report bearing on this particular aspect of the matter is so Instructive that I have reproduced it as an annex to this memorandum.6. A further point to which I invite the attention of my colleagues is that where the adjustment of a tariff is entrusted to a Commission which considers particular cases when they happen to be brought before it, and particularly whs; a those applications relate to the imposition or increase of duties, it is inevitable that their recommendation should have regard rather to the individual industries or groups of industries under consideration than to the national economy as a whole.     The Gommittees set up by Conservative Governments unde   Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921, and the T-hite Paper relating to the Safeguarding of Industries were not allowed to consider the general reactions of any suggested dutyj    they were limited to considering the possibility of an adverse effect of any duty whioh they might
recommend upon employment in any industry using in production goods of the claaa or description to which the application related.     But this is a narrow point of view    it takes, for instance, no account of the reactions of the imposition   of duties on imported goods on our export trade with countries from which those goods are derived.     This is a responsibility which no Government could properly transfer to a Commission of the kind contemplated, nor would such a Commission be capable of bearing that responsibility,7. Finally, it should bo noted that Mr. Baldwin still-persists in his advocacy of &quot;bargaining&quot; as a means of reducing foreign tariffs;    &quot;not until this country puts herself on an equality with other countries of the world in her fiscal system will it be possible for her to begin that bargaining which, I firmly believe, will end in easing tariff difficulties throughout the world&quot;.     It is obviously impossible to reconcile a process of securing &quot;by negotiation and by agreements a reduction of those duties which, maintained as they are, are a permanent danger to the trade of the world&quot; with a tariff which would be &quot;fairly and scientifically adjusted&quot; to give to home industries the full measure of protection for which they could individually shov? cause, and no more.    The function of x-r. 3aldwin&apos;s proposed Commission is to be the determination of the minimum amount of protection requisite for particular individual industries.     It obviously could not concern itself directly with tariff bargaining; ybut it would inevitably always nave in mind the possibility of the rates which it recommended being modified as the result of international bargaining;    it would tend to be driven in all cases to allow a substantial margin above the minimum requisite;   and others  would always be the risk that because particular commodities were not made use of, for whatever reason,  for bargaining purposes, tho amount of protection afforded would in fact be
excessive.     And. in general the industries which have most gaJEaawb by a reduction of foreign tariffs are those which have the least to gain by the protection of the home market;    the coal and cotton industries are outstanding examples.     There seems to be no escape from the dilemma that the exporting industries whose interest is in lower foreign tariffs must have first consideration or that their interests must be sacrificed to those industries which rely chiefly on the home market.      In either case the consideration of the rate to be allowed to industries of the two classes vrust be determined by the responsible Government of the day and by Parliament;    it is clearly outside the competence of any such Com-iission as is proposed;    and the result must inevitably be the introduction of more of those political influences which Mr. Baldwin is so anxious to exclude.W.G.Board of Trade,7th August, 1931.
UK EX     1*Tariff Boards (or like bodies under othor names) function, as permanent institutions, in the United States of America, Australia, tho Irish FrGe Statoj the Union of South Africa, and British India,    Until recently Canada had a Tariff Board and will soon have another.The following notes indicate in summary form the duties with which these bodies are charged in the oountries mentioned, Including a reference to the proposals contained in the Canadian Tariff Board Bill aB introduoed.United States of America.Tho Tariff Commission is composed of six Commissioners appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,    Wot more than three of the Commissioners may be members of tho same political party, members of different political parties being appointed alternately as nearly as may be practicable.    Terms of office of the Commissioners first taking office after the enactment of the Tariff Act (June, 1930) expire, as designated by the President   at the time of nomination, one at the end of each of the first six years after^ the date of enactment of the Tariff Act.    The term of office of successors expires six years from the date of Expiration of the term for which his predecessor v/as appointed.   Ho Commissioner shall actively engage in any other business, vocation, or employment than that of serving as a Commissioner,The Commission investigates tho administration and fisoal and industrial effects of the United States Customs Laws, the relations between tho rates of duty on raw materials and finished or partly finished products, tho
effects of ad valorem and specific duties and of compound specific and ad valorem duties, all questions relative to the arrangement of schedules and the classification of articles in the several schedules of the Customs Law and, in general, the operation of Customs Laws, including their relation to the Federal revenues, their effect upon the industries and labour of the country;    and submits reports of its investigations.The Commission has power to investigate the Tariff relations between the United States and foreign countries, commercial treaties, preferential provisions, economic alliances, the effect of export bounties and preferential transport rates, the volume of importations compared with domestic production and consumption, and conditions, causes and effects relating to competition of foreign industries with those of the United States, including dumping and cost of production.For the information and assistance of the President and Congress, the Commission is required to ascertain conversion costs and costs of production of articles of the United States in the principal centres of the United States, and (when necessary for purpose of comparison) of foreign articles imported into the United States in the principal centres of foreign countries;     and to ascertain all facts which will show the differences in, or which affect competition between, articles of the United States and imported articles in the principal markets of the United States,The Commission must put at the disposal of the President, the Committee on ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate, whenever requested, all information at its command, and shall make such investigations and reports as may be
requested &quot;by the President e* the Committees or by either branoh of Congress.The Commission investigates the differences between costs of production of United States artioles and the like or similar foreign articles, holding hearings at which interested parties may attend to give evidence; and shall specify in its report such increase or decrease of duty (not exceeding 50 per cent,  of the rates fixed by statute) as it finds shown by the investigation to be necessary to equalise such differences.    Such changes of duty are enforced by Presidential proclamation,  if the President agrees with the Commissions findings.    These so-called &quot;flexible Tariff&quot; provisions do not extend to the trans-ference of an article from the dutiable list to the free list, or vice versa.To assist the President in making any decisions to prohibit the entry of articles the importation or sale of whioh by the owner,importer or consignee is connected with unfair methods of c ompetition and unfair acts, to the possible detriment of United States industry, the Commission is authorised to make investigations and transmit its findings to the President.It is the duty of the Commission to ascertain whether any country discriminates against the commerce of the United States by transport or transit charges, by law or administrative regulation or practice, by Customs, tonnage or port duty, fee, charge, exaction, classification, regulation,  condition, restriction or prohibition,  in suoh manner as to place the commerce of the United states at a disadvantage compared with the commerce of any other foreign country;    to report to the President when such discrimination is disclosed, and to make recommendations to him.
The Commission is required by the Tariff Act to ascertain with respect to each of the ad valorem rates of duty and each of the rates of duty regulated by the value of the article, specified in that Act, an ad valorem rate (or a rate regulated by the   value of the article, as the case may be) which if applied upon the basis of the domestic value of goods (wholesale price in the United States) would have resulted as nearly as possible in the imposition during the period July 1, 1927 to June 30, 1929 of amounts of duty, neither greater nor less than would have been collectible at the rate specified in the Act of 1930, applied upon the basis of the wholesale market value of goods in the oountry of export.    The Commission is to present a report to Congress, setting out the converted rates, not later than July 1st, 1932.Australia.Under the Tariff Board Acts, 1921-1929, the Tariff Board consists of four members, one of whom shall be an administrative officer of the Department of Trade and Customs.    This member may be appointed Chairman of the Board.    Appointments are for noo less than one year and not more than three years.    Each member, on the expiration of his term of office, is eligible for re-appointment.The purpose of the Tariff Board is to assist the minister in the administration of matters relating to trade and customs.    The more important matters which the minister shall refer to the Board for enquiry and report include any disputes arising out of the interpretation of any Customs or Excise Tariff j the neoessity for new, increased or reduced dutiesj    the neoessity for granting bonuses j any proposal for the application of the British Preferential Tariff or the Intermediate Tariff to any part
of the British Dominions or any foreign country;    and any question whether a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him by the tariff by charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods or acting in restraint of trade.   The Minister may refer to the Board for inquiry and report the following matters;-   the classification of goods for duty;    the determination of the value of goods for duty;    the general effect of the working of the Customs Tariff and the Exoise Tariff;    the fiscal and industrial effects of the Customs laws of the Commonwealth, the incidence between the rates of duty on raw materials and on finished or partly finished products;   and any other matter affecting the encouragement of primary and secondary Industries in relation to the tariff.Irish Free State.Under Acts of 1926 and 1930, the Tariff Commission consists of three members;    one, who shall be Chairman, is nominated by the Minister of Finance, one by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and one by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.   Eaoh member is appointed for two years, but is eligible for renomination.Whenever an application is made to the Minister of Finance, by any person substantially representative of the persons engaged or proposing to engage in the production in the Irish Free State of goods of any particular kind for the imposition, modification, abolition or renewal of a Customs duty on the importation of goods of that kind, the Minister may refer ouch application to the Commission. The Executive Council may refer to the Commission any matter or question relating to the imposition, modification, abolition or renewal of a Customs duty.    All Reports made
by the Commission, whether on an application referred to them by the Minister of Finance or on a question referred to them by the Executive Council, are made to the Executive Council.     The Commission is required to consider every application or question referred to it and to report on the several aspects (specified in a Schedule to the Act) of such application or question or such of these aspects as are applicable thereto.There are 10 items In the Schedule, the first four of which are here quoted by way of illustrations&quot;1. The efficiency, extent, and relative importance of the industry in respect of which the application is made, the amount of capital invested therein, the number of persons employed therein, the total annual value of the goods produced by the said Industry, and the cost of production of such goods in Saorstat Eireann as compared with such cost in other countries.2.   The cost, efficiency, conditions of labour, and rates of wages in Saorstat Eireann in the industry in respect of which the application is made as compared with such cost, efficiency, conditions, and rates in other countries.S.   The effect which the granting in whole or .in part of the concessions asked for in the application would be likely to have on the several matters mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Schedule.4.   The effect which the granting in whole or inpart of the concessions asked for in the applicationwould be likely to have on other trades and industries in Saorstat Eireann.&quot;-12-
Union, of South Africa.The Board of Trade and Industries consists of a chairman and not more than three other members, who hold office for a period not exceeding three years, and who may be re-appointed from time to time for a further period not exceeding three years.     The appointment or re-appointment of members provides for their retirement by rotation.    The chairman and members receive such salaries or remuneration (out of moneys appropriated by Parliament for the purpose) as the Governor-General may determine.Subject to the direction of the Minister, the functions and duties of the Board, as defined by Act No.33 of 1924, shall be to inquire into and advise the Government on all matters concerning the economic development of the natural resources of the Union and its industries and trade, and in particular on -(a) the payment of bounties or other forms of Stateaid for industries;(b) fiscal policy in so far as it bears on commerce and Industry;(o) the recasting and revision of the Customs Tariff;(d) the removal of anomalies from time to time in theCustoms and Exoise Tariffs;(e) complaints or recommendations on the working ofthe Customs and Exoise Tariffs;(f) combinations, trusts, monopolies, and restraintsof trade tending to affect the general interest Injuriously, especially by restricting production or maintaining or raising prices;    and the prevention thereof;(g) the dumping of imported goods whereby UnionIndustries are likely to be unfavourably affected;
(h) the supply-of raw materials, labour and teohnlcal knowledge for industry, and the encouragement of the Investment of capital in industry;(I) transport and markets for the requisites and products of industries I(;)) the relation between factory, wholesale, and retail prices(k) commercial legislation;(1) suoh other matters as the Minister may refer to it for report.The Boayd shall report to the Minister on the matters referred to it and on such matters as may be referred to the Board by statutes, and, in doing so, it is the duty of the Board to report as   fully as possible on all aspects of any matter referred to It, in so far as they may affect the revenue, trade, and oommeroial and economic conditions, with speoial reference to the probable effect of any action reconmended, on the consumer and those employed in industry.British India.The Tariff Board was appointed In 192? (for one year in the first instance) following the acceptance by the Government of India of the policy of &quot;discriminating protection&quot; for Indian industry.   The Board has been re-appointed from time to time and has reported on numerous applications for Tariff protection (or bounty) which have been referred to it by the Indian Government.   The Government selects the industries to be taken up for investigation and determines the order of the enquiry; and the Board, after investigation, makes recommendations regarding the protection (if any) to be extended to those industries and the nature and extent of the protection.
The Board apparently consists of two Indians with experience in economic matters, and a senior European official.    Its functions and procedure are not regulated by legislation.Canada.In May last a Bill was introduced In the House ofCommons to provide for the appointment of a Tariff Board in place of the Board which was abolished by the present administration.Under the Bill as introduced, the Board will consist ofthree Members, who will hold office for ten years, and will berequired to give their whole time to the work.&quot;The duties of the Board are set out in section 4 of the Bill.   As directed by the Minister, they are to inquire into the price and cost of raw materials, the cost of transportation, the cost of production, the cost, efficiency and conditions of labour, the prices received by producers, etc., in Canada or elsewhere, and all conditions and factors affecting cost of production and price to the consumers in Canada, and as compared with other countries.   The Board is empowered to make inquiry into any other matter upon which the Minister desires information, in relation to any goods which if brought into Canada or produced in Canada are subject to or exempt from duties of customs or excise.    This Inquiry may be into the effect which an increase or decrease of the existing rate of duty upon a given commodity might have upon Industry or trade, end the extent to which the consumer is protected from exploitation.The Board is empowered to hold an inquiry into combinations which enhance prices, under section 15 of the Customs Tariff, and under the Combines Investigation Act, and any other matter which may be referred to it by the Governor in Council.&quot;&quot;Under Part II of the Bill the Tariff Board, from and after a date to be fixed by the Governor in Council, will exercise all the powers, functions and duties of the Board of Customs.     The Board of Customs is very largely a committee of the executive heads of that Department, and if an importer makes appeal he is practically appealing- to the Department itself to review the Departments own decision.    The change would, therefore, seem advisable in the interests of Justice.&quot;Y/hilst the former Tariff Board was enabled to make re-commend at Ions as to the imposition of duties, modification of rates, etc, the new Board apparently is to report only on questions of fact
ANflEX II.Extract from Report of the Australian Tariff Board for the year 1927-28.The Need for a Scientific Tariff. -   The Tariff Board welcomes evidence of a renewal of interest in the necessity for a scientific tariff.It might safely be said that the first serious move in the history of the Commonwealth towards the framing of a tariff on scientific lines was the enaotment of the Tariff Board Act 1921.This legislation provides for the appointment of a Board and, as subsequently amended, for the hearing of all applications for Tariff Revision in public.   In fact the Act requires that all evidence tendered in this connexion must be in public and on oath and mates exception only to evidence clearly of a confidential nature which, in the opinion of the Board, it is desirable in the public interest to take in camera.The stipulation that evidenoe must be tendered in public instils a degree of caution in the mind of the parties making a request.   Further and more important than this, the opponents of the tariff alterations asked for are enabled to hear both the request of the applicants and the arguments advanced in favour of it.   They are also enabled to reply forthwith to such arguments, and the applicant in his turn is safeguarded by the fact that such replies must be made in publio and in his hearing.Under the Tariff Board system the fullest publicity is given of the intention to hold these public inquiries and every person interested is given the opportunity of presenting his views.
It is well to know the difficulties which lie in the way of the framing of a scientific tariff.     The Commonwealth has had close on 28 years* experience of tariff making6 the tabling of a Federal Tariff being one of the earliest acts of the Commonwealth Parliament.     The appointment of a Tariff Board was mace only after some twenty years&apos; experience in other rethods of tariff Investigation.   Therefore the Board inherited a legacy, the result of past methods, and can obviously claim no credit for the result of those methods, nor can it be expected to accept any blame for the condition of affairs which existed at the time of its appointment.The Tariff Board appreciates the disinclination of Parliament to relegate to any Board or any other authority (even if such authority be appointed by the Parliament) full powers to deal with the Customs Tariff, even on a policy laid down by the Parliament itself.   The powers of the present Board are of investigation and recommendation only, and it is doubtful if it or any organization would ever be clothed with any greater powers.While not endeavouring to usurp the functions of the Minister or. of the Parliament, the Board desires to   point out that as regards some of the most important subjects investigated by the Board, either the Minister of the day or the Parliament has seen fit to act otherwise than in accordance with the recommendation of the Board.   Instances of Important subjects on which the reoommendations of the Board have not been adopted are the reports on the Cotton Bounty and on the import duties affecting the Iron and Steel Industry and the Timber Industry.The point that it is desired to make is that the tariff aotion recently taken on these important matters was contrary to the recommendation of the body appointed by Parliament
to investigate and recommend, and if the tariff on these subjeots should be amongst those considered to be unscientific: then the Tariff Board has no responsibility for the faulty framing thereof.The method adopted by Interested parties to influence departure from the Tariff Board&apos;s recommendation is worthy of study and deserving of strong comment.    It has happened, after the Tariff Board has held an Inquiry, at which over a hundred witnesses were publicly examined on oath, has oarefully studied the whole of the public and confidential evidence, and has presented a recommendation to the Minister, that a few men, parties to the application, have made representations to members of Parliament and to the Govern-ment which have resulted in the setting aside of the weight of public evidence and the studied recommendation of the Board.Different industries have been developed to a particular degree in the different States of the Commonwealth. It has been a practice of persons working in Parliamentary lobbies in the interests of their,conoerns to procure assistanoe for their project by bargaining for reciprocal aid - one State group with another.     This practice has been rather successful to the parties, but it has proved one of the strongest factors in preventing the enactment of a well-balanced Tariff.   Undoubtedly the principal object of the enactment of the Tariff Beard Aot requiring evidence to be publicly given and on oath, was to put an end as far as possible to the use by interested individuals of unfair influence exerted by the presentation of a one-aided view of the case under circumstances which allow of no considered answer from the opponents.In the foregoing comment the Board imputes no wrongful motives on the part of the principals who engage in this
method of seeking tariff assistance.     The Board is willing to believe that the principals are honest in the belief that their views are correct.     However, the Board claims that the representations put forward are those of one side only.     These same representations have been previously publicly placed before the Tariff Board in conjunction with a mass of evidence to the contrary.      The Beard has adjudged the weight of evidence as being against such representations, and notwithstanding this the representations of one side is presented ex parte, and prevails.another difficulty experienced in tariff framing is that when alterations in tariff proposals are made during the :passage of a Tariff Schedule through Parliament, the effect of such alterations cannot be fully foreseen.      The Tariff Board in its consideration of applications for alterations in the tarifi has in mind always the effect that any recommendation it might make would have on other industries. Alterations necessarily somewhat hurriedly considered in the heat of discussion are liable to result in a badly-balanced tariff with consequential   dislocation of industries affected by the alteration.These are some of the influences which are operating against the framing of a scientific ta. iff and while the Board appreciates the difficulties of the position it should be absolved of the responsibility for actions entirely outside its control.
