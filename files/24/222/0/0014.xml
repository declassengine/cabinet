At a subsequent moeting with the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation held on June 30th* ,  it was ma tie clear that the proposals of the Mining Association would have no chance of acceptance Try the Delegate Conference of theFederation; which is to meet on July 2nd,Ac this juncture a letter was received from the Mining Association to the effect that in order to ease thesituation the Association was prepared (on condition of the Government&apos;s introducing legislation,  to extend the operation of the 7-g--hour day until such time as the Geneva convention is ratified and comes into operation,jhut with no other&quot;-v *--limit of time),^to consult their constituent Associations on a proposal that &quot;the Mining Association should act before the expiry of the twelve months as a channel of communication for obtaining from the District Coalownors&apos; Associations similar information in regard to wages to that which has been supplied tin this occasion&quot;c     A copy of this letter isattached (see Appendix III)/.The Coal Mines Act of 1926 as amended by the Act of 1930 5-imits the daily extension of hours beyond the 7 laid down in the Act of 1919 to half-an-hour- so lung as the 1926 Act continues in force;  ice0  until 8th July,  193 lo      In the absence of new legislation, therefore,  the 7-hour day comes automatically into operation as from that date.In these circumstances the Committee submit to theCahinet the following alternative courses of action :--
To let the existing law take its course -there can &quot;be no question, that in the present economic condition of the industry a 7&apos;-hour day could only he operated with drastic wage reductions in all districts.,    These would certainly he rejected by the men and a general stoppage on July 8th would result to introduce a Bill to extend the operation of the 7-g--hour day-hut without eprea&amp;ovor, for 12 months j and also to provide that during that period there should &quot;be no reduction in the present rates of wages (except in those districts n^w working tho sprea&amp;ovor, in which cases the appropriate reductions would be a matter for local s c o &quot;o a. em e ixc j aTo introduce a Bill tc  extend the operation of the 7- ---hour day, out without spreadover?for a period up to the date of ratificationtheand/coming into operation of the geneva convention, but with no other limit of time, subject to an undertaking by the mining association (in a form accepted by the Miners Federation) to meet the miners Federation nationally before the expiry of the twelvemonths guarantee period, and to re-establish the same machinery as has been in existence, recently for discussing in advance between the Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federation the situation which will arise on the expiration of tho guaranteesc

APPENDIX II,oil!E 0 RET.LETTER ADDRESSED Th THE PRIMS MINISTER BY MR. EVAN WILLIAMS COVERING STATEMENT PREPARED BY THE IvIINING ASSOCIATION OF  GREAT BRITAIN.The Mining Association., uf-C-real-J3rxiai; General Buildings,Aldwych,     W.C.2.2Gth June,  1931.Dear Prime Minister,In accordance with yiur request my colleagues and I have considered the statement presented to us by the Coal Committee ef the Cabinet this morning and have prepared the -enclac-cd re-draft.      In submit ting this t^ you my colleagues and I would like to explain that we have tried tc keep aa cltsely to the&apos;original draft as passible,  consistently with the observance *f the conditions which arc essential to the guarantees which the District Associations have offered.      In particular I would desire to repeat that two points on which wc are bc*urd to maintain the position already explained in detail to you are that in no circumstances can, the Mining Association he placu-d in the position of exercising any power of review of district wages arrangements, and that it is not possible for the owners to&quot;give any guarantees of wages except on the basis of a Bill unlimited in respect of the period $f its operation apart from the contingency,of the ratification of the Geneva C^uvonticn. r
1.      Thfi Government propose to take appropriate diplomatic steps after consultation with the Miners&apos; Federation and the Mining Association with a view to the ratification of the Geneva Convention.2.      They intend to introduce legislation   covering such period as may elapse prior to the coming into force of legislation introduced to enable the Government to ratify the Convention.3. They will accordingly &quot;bring in a Bill authorising th**-working of the existing hours during r.uch intervening period.4.      During a period of 12 months, or until the date of the coming into force cf the legislation referred to in paragraph 2,  if earlier,  the guarantees offered by the District Coalowners&apos; Associations which are members of the Mining Association with regard to wages shall apply.5.      In reply to the point urged by the Government that the period of 12 months may expire before the coming into foroe of the legislation referred to in paragraph 2, the Mining Association, while making it clear that they have no power to interfere in district wages arrangements, intimate that they are prepared to meet the Miners&apos; Federation from time to time to disouss all matters within their compctonce affecting the industry as a whole.
I feel that even now it is not fully realised how groat are the sacrifices and how serious are ths risks which the owners have faced in offering guarantees even for six months, and still more in extending them to twelve months. In the existing financial condition of the industry and in view of the very uncertain future; hut I trust tha^t you will be able to appreciate that in assenting to the proposals embodied In the enclosed statement the owners have gone as far as they can reasonably be expected to go in a serious effort to avoid the terrible calamity - both for the industry itself and the country - of a stoppage in the coal mining industry.You will observe that in paragraph 3 of the enclosed statement we have referred to ,:the existing hours,J.    It is understood that the question of the spreadover is bound up with the discussions v*hich are to take place in Scotland on Monday.I need only add that, as I am sure you have fully appreciated, the owners have approached this matter in the sincere desire to do all  that is reasonably practicable and in no spirit of bargaining and that this is the definite limit to which they can go.Yours faithfully,(Sgd. )    EVAN YfILLIAMS.St.Hon.  J. Ramsay MacDoRald, M*P. , It&quot;), Downing Street, - .S.    1.
APPENDIX    III,THE MINING ASSOCIATION OP GREAT BRITAIN.^Oth June,  -1 951 .R.B. Koworth Esq.. ,   0,B., Offices of the Cabinet, 2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1 .Dear Mr. Howorth..,The representatives of the colliery owners who met the Coal Committee of the Cabinet this morning have been reviewing the proceedings at the meeting and in particular the Prime Minister*s references to the position at the and of twelve months as the point of difficulty in the way of the introduction of legislation without limit of time save that which may be involved in ratification of the Geneva Convention.,In dealing with this point the Prime Minister recognised that the Mining Association cannot negotiate on wages questions and have no power of interference with the district v/ages arrangements but suggested that it would suffice to meet the point if the Mining Association would agree to act before the expiry of the twelve months as a channel of communication for obtaining from the District. Goalowners&apos; Associations similar information in regard to wages to that which has been supplied on this occasion.The owners&apos; representatives would be glad if they could be informed whether they are correct in talcing it that the adoption of the above suggestion made by the prime Minister this morning would dispose of the Government&apos;s difficulty in the way of the introduction of legislation undated except in relation to the Geneva Convention.In that event, whilst the owners&apos; representatives are unable to say that the District Goalowners1 Associations would accept the proposal,  they would submit it to them at once for consideration.Yours faithfully,(Signed)    E.A.  LEE,
