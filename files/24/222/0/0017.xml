COAL MINUS BILL.  1951. Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines. Hours of Work.3?5aj m ^The necessity for the present Bill arises primarily out of the operation of the existing law in regard to hours of work underground in coal mines.      The Coal Mines Regulation Act of 1908, which is the principal Act,  fixed the maximum daily hours at 8.    This limit was reduced to 7 &quot;by the Act of 1919.      The Act of 1926, however, temporarily increased it to 8 - the increase operating only for a period of 5 years.      This five year period comes to an end on July 8th of this year, and failing legislation to prevent it the limit of working hours will then revert to 7.The Coal Mines Act of last year (part III.) partially anticipated1the reduction of hours from 8 to 7 &quot;by providing for a reduction, as from 1st December, 1930,  to 7-g-.      . That Act also provided that in cer-tain circumstances it should be permissible (where the owners and work-men in any individual district  jointly asked for it) to work more than-.j hours a day, provided that the aggregate hours worked per fortnight-did not exceed 90.      A number of districts availed themselves of this ,! spread-over&quot; concession,  so as to avoid   reductions in wages.    Pour districts     were unaffected by the reduction of hours to 7^, having been previously working a 7-g- hours day by agreement.    Of the districtsthat reduced their hours to a uniform 7-g-, some have had wage rr-duction-s/ and others have not.1&apos;The July Position&quot; The difficulties attendant upon the reduction of hours from 8 to 7-g- made it increasingly clear that the industry would be faced with a very critical situation this month when the 1926 Act lapsed,  and the 7 hour day returned.    The economic position of the industry generally and the acute depression in the export trade made it clear that the hours position and the wages position,  as they would stand on July 8th, ought to be considered together as one problem without delay.    The attitude-k Yorkshire, Notts,. IT. Derby, Kent. /&quot;Notably South Vales.
&amp;i   0the Mining Association, however, was that although they were ready to sscuss hours, they had no power to discuss wages nationally,  these ling entirely a matter for the districts.History of the negotiations. Larly in the. present year efforts were made by the Government to t over this difficulty and to get the two sides together in conference. d it was hoped that their discussions would eventually bring them to consideration of &quot;the July position&apos;&apos; as a whole.    Eventually a meeting was brought about between small committees of the Mining association and the Miners&apos; Federation,  and discussions took place in egard to the draft International Convention which came before the international Labour Conference at Geneva in June,    The hope that these iscussions would lead to a general consideration of the whole position hich would arise on July 8th was, however, not fulfilled;    and as aesult the Government intervened,  and asked each body to appoint to special committee to discuss the whole question with the Coal Committeeduringf the Cabinet.    These discussions -/which the Cabinet Committee 3t the owners1  and workmen&apos;s representatives separately, continued untiluly 2nd, when, no basis of agreement having been found, at the uggestidn of the Government, the owners and workmen held a joint fleeting,  to see whether any basis for agreement could be found as a suit of the discussions with the Government.      Following upon this oint meeting, the miners&apos;  representatives informed the Government hat no basis for agreement could be found.The wages position-The central point of difficulty in the present crisis is, f course, the question of wages.      It has been clear to all parties that a reduction of hours from 7-g- to 7 could not, in the present tate of the industry, be effected without drastic wage reductions n practically all districts.      Such reductions the miners are not repared to consider,  wages already being at a very low level, n these circumstances the immediate reversion to a 7 hour day &quot;is eeoncm-
ically impracticable.At the  same time the miners1  demand for some guarantee that,  in the event of their . fa.iJ.ing to aecure the reduction in -hours to which they are entitled under the existing law,  their present wages shall not be further reduced during the continuance of the 7%; hour day,  appears to the Government to have justification In the very low rates already rulingsDuring the coxirso       the aegotiations with the owners, efforts were made tu secure from them suoh a guarantee:  and. eventually the owners did offer,  on behalf of their associated, districts individually, to guarantee that existing wages (ice., minimum percentage additions to basis rates, and. the  &quot;subsistence&quot; wage rates) should net be reduced for the next 12 months.     It is true that this offer was made subject to the extension of the 7-g- hour clay being unlimited, (except by the coming into force cf the Geneva Convention): but nevertheless it was made-     The miners on their side, however,  could, not agree to an extension of the 7k hour day for a period which might well exceed the limited wages guarantee.The present Bill makes tho extension of the 7^- hour day and tho guarantee of present wage rates  og*-t-srmittous - for a period of one year,  or until the recent Geneva Convention is ratified, and put into effect - whichever is the shorter period.The Geaeva Convention. Briefly the Convention adopted in Geneva laot month provides for a daily maximum for underground workers of 7% hours 5 bank to bankr .     There is an article specifically admitting the British-method of calculation, with the proviso that the daily figure, in terms of our legislation,; shall be 7jra hours.a: There was a misunderstanding in the case of South T/;ales, where t guarantee only extended six months,  in view of the terms of the wage agreement in that district .      It seems probable that an extension of this offer could have been secured,  but with the breakdown of negotiations, the question was left in the air,
The Convention is to come into force 6 months after ratification by any two of the following countries Belgium.- Czechoslovakia. France, Germany,, Great Britain, Netherlands and Poland and it nay be necessary to negotiate with some of the other countries concerned with a view to securing simultaneous ratification.The Government has announced both to the coalowners and the miners its intention of getting into touch with the other Governments and pressing on the general ratification of the Convention by all possible means.      The coalowners have expressed their readiness to discuss at any time, both with the miners and with the Government, the important practical questions affecting this country which will have to be decided before we can give effect to ratification.The bearing&quot; of the Geneva Convention on the present situation is that it contemplates uniform hours of v/ork throughout Europe and simultaneous reduction of working time in all countries.      The fact that the existing standard of wages in this country is already above that of our chief competitors had to be taken into account yrhen considering the possibility of the hours in this country falling below those in other countries.The Bill-The present bill as has already been stated, provides (a) for the temporary extension of the 7-2-hour day, and (b)  that the present minimum percentage additions to basis rates and the present subsistence wages shall not be reduced.
(a) The form of the hours extension..Is necessitated, by the form of previous legislation.      The 1908 Act is the principal Act s and this lays down 8 hours as the maximum.      The 1919 Act altered this to 7 hours, and there were then temporary alterations (in 1926 and 1950) to 0 hours, and 7-g hours respectively.      These temporary variations of the 7 hour limit were both effected by means of amending Section 3 of the 1908 Act, which allowed an additional hour to be worked, at the discretion of the management, on not more than 60 days in a calendar year.      This provision was ariended, first of all by simply cutting out the 60 day limit, and then (in the case of the 7-g- hour day) by substituting halfan hour for one hour.      The effect of these successive amendments of Section 3 of the 1908 Act is simply to allo&quot;/ the extra half-hour to be worked on every day in the year3      It will be seen therefore that with the expiration of the hon^s sections of the 1926 and 1930 Acts 7 hours is still the permanent standard under the 1908 Act, as amended by the 1919 Act.      The extension to 7-g- hours is only temporary.(b) The Bill also provides for a wages guarantee to run co-1erminously &quot;with the temporary extension of hours. Roughly speaking, a miner&apos;s wages fall into two parts, the basis rate and the district percentage addition.The basis rate, which varies    district by district, class by class, and pit by pit, is fixed by local, negotiations.      In the case of piece-workers, the basis
9 9 t) orates are constantly changing according to the natural conditions which are being dealt with. This Bill does not in any way affect these basis rates.      They remain quite apart from it 9 and will continue to be regulated in accordance with local custom and existing machinery.      In addition to the basis rate5 there is a percentage addition which roughly speakings reflects the prosperity or other-wise of the industry in each individual district 9 and which is applied uniformly all over the District and to all classes of underground workmen alike.The Bill provides that the minimum percen-tage additions in force upon the   appointed day&quot; in each district shall not be reduced during the period of the hours extension.As well an the percentage addition., certain of the lover paid day wage workmen receive what is called ::subsistence wage&quot;.     This means that where the workman&apos;s total earnings on basis plus percentage do not reach a certain figures he receives a cash allowance to bring them up to that figure.    As in the case of the percentage additions 9 the subsistence wages vary district by districts but the general idea of them is that no man shall receive less than is necessary for actual subsistence.In guaranteeing the maintenance, of these two types of wage rates9 the Bill fixes, then as minima and does not stabilise then;    that is to say. there is nothing to prevent the workmen applying
for increases j in accordance with the normal arrangements under-the various district wages agreements. 9n *si e) 1&quot;The appointed day&quot;0As stated ahove, the Bill affects each district as from the &quot;appointed day&quot;ft      In the case of all districts except Scotland, North Wales and Cumberland, the &quot;appointed day&quot; is the day en which the Bill becomes lav/;, vis,  8th July,      In the case *f Scotland and North &apos;7ales5 the present percentage additions and subsistence rates are based not upon a uniform 7-g- hour day, bu upon a &quot;spreadover&quot; of hour-Sj,     Por the purposes of this Bill therefore, the &quot;appointed day&quot; for these districts will be t he first day upon which they a rrive at a new agreement, with new rates, applicable to a 7-g- hour day.      In the case of Cumberland, the whole district is at present on stop,  the workmen having declined to accept a recent recommendation of the National Industrial Board for a new wages agreement     Here aga.in,  the &quot;appointed day&quot; will be fixed by reference to the conclusion of a new agreement.The period covered by the. BilloThe period in respect of which the  extension of the 7-g-hour day and the wages guarantee applies is one year or the period up to the coming into force of the Geneva Convention, whichever period is the shorter.      The maximum extent of the Bill&apos;s operation therefore is one year.(Intld)    E, S.Mine s Depar tment, . Jwly 4th,  1931.
