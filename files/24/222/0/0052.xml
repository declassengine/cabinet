4. The Committee gave most careful consideration tothe question of a &quot;premium1&apos; to he paid &quot;by unemployed workpeople in receipt of &quot;benefit , that is the proposal that such persons should pay 1/- per week out of their benefit. After much discussion this proposal was finally abandoned on the ground of the serious, consequences which it would have on the Unemployment Fund and the complications which it would cause.      The amount to be found was, therefore, increased by a sum of  -2-g- millions, making a total sum to be found of - 28-g- millions.5. The Committee report as follows:-(l) That for the reasons given above the proposal for a &quot;premium&apos;1 to be paid by unemployed workers is impracticable. (2.) That the 26 weeks rule should be supplemented by requiring a qualifying period of employment after a claimant has received 26 weeks ordinarj7-benefit and before he is entitled to further ordinary benefit. (3) That a needs test be applied by the Ministry of Labour through such local machinery as may be devised to persons not entitled to ordinary benefit.      The Minister of Health estimated that this would produce not more than  5m. per year.(4)  If the Cabinet were to approve the payment of an additional contribution of 2d. by insured persons in work (making a total of l/-)  towards the cost of this scheme this will yield  4m.
