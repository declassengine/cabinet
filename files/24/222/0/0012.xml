J (VTHT^^DCGUIvIgKT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. jSECRET. COPY NO,_CP.161(31)CAB  I N E T.RUSSIAN ORDERS FOR SHIPS.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,With reference to CP. 95 (31), I circulate, for the Information of my colleagues, the attached extract from a confidential letter received in the Board of Trade from a shipbroker. 0W.Q..Board of Trade ,29th June, 1931./
I went to the Russians -yesterday with a massage from my shipowner-clients to the effect that if they wanted to &quot;buy their snips they must put up some reasonable offor to pay for them and to pay for them on ordinary terms.      To this Yanson (the Chairman of Arcos) replied dilating upon the necessity of the Russians to be granted credit terms;    and in viow of the need (which he recognised) that some security or guarantee should form part of any credit-term arrangement he insisted that it is incumbent on those who wish to sell to the Russians to bring pressure to bear on the British Government to obtain British Government help, in the form of guarantee.     He referred to the procedure followed by the Export Credits Department, whereby British Sellers of piece goods * or machinery,  (not the purchasers) nave to submit definite schemes or &quot;proposals&quot; as a preliminary to obtaining the guarantee of the Department.      In the same way,he urged me, would-be sellers of ships to the P-Ussians Shouldfmake it their business to urge the Board of Trade to guarantee Russian deferred payments.     He pressed me to see what 1 could do in consultation with my shipowner-clients to draw up a hypothetical scheme for the sale of a ship or ships of theirs to the Russians on the basis of a Government guarantee being part of the arrangement.      He assured me that M. Zoff the Commissar at present in England has been and still is in consultation with Mr. G.?vl. Gillett. M. P, - and Mr.  Thomas Johnston, M.F. and that the Government has told M, Zoff that they are perfectly willing to consider guaranteeing Russian deferred payments for ships provided only that they (the Government) are approached by the Shipowners who wish to sell with definite and concrete information of ships which the Owners are prepared to sell, and of the terms of the proposed sale which the Government is asked to assist with a guarantee.
In other words, the Russians are trying to manoeuvre the British shipowners into the position of petitioning Russia to buy their ships and petitioning the British government to help the transaction.This is an immense piece of bluff.      I am sure my shipowner-clients will not consider putting themselves into such a position for a moment but will answer &quot;let the Russians go without our ships:    we are not asking them to buy them&quot;.However the fact Is that my clients like many others would be only too glad to sell their ships.     On national and commercial grounds it is far better if Russia is to create a Mercantile Marine of its own that it should buy our old ships rather than bring new vessels into existence j   and from their own individual point of view, there are few shipowners who would not be glad to realise cash at the moment.      Therefore, while taking a firm negative attitude to these Russian manoeuvres, and absolutely declining to appear themselves in any approach to the Government, I believe my clients would not be averse to my exercising myself (as a broker) to find out if there is anything in what Yanson says about the assurances of the politicians I have named.     If there is anything, then they would not be above availing themselves of the help suggested; in other words they would consider giving the Board of Trade definite information of ships they would sell subject to a Government guarantee, if they knew that the Government were likely to give any guarantee.      On the other hand, if I and my clients learnt definitely that the Board of Trade Is not consider ing anything of the kind as alleged by the Chairman of Arcos, then we should know that we were being bluffed, and on resuming negotiations with him should be in a position to defy his suggestions that any purpose would be served by our seeking Government help.
