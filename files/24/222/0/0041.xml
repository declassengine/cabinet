KTS DOCUMENT IS TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.ST. 191/31)CABINET MORAY FIRTHcopy Nogf j ,Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries.1.        Although I share the views of the Secretary of State for Scotland, as to the merits of the Moray Firth fishermen, and sympathise with his desire to promote their welfare, I find myself unable to agree to his proposal to claim that area as either national or territorial waters, or as exclusive fishery limits, because such a proposal mould inevitably result in analogous claims being put forward by other Nations which would, if successful, seriously restrict the operations of our trawlers, upon which we must depend for by far the greater proportion of the fish consumed in this country.2.        As appears from the figures appended to the Memorandum presented by the Secretary of State for Scotland, the fishing in the Moray Firth produces yearly about 8,000 tons of white fish valued at  220,000.     The Trawling Fleet on the other hand produced in 1930 nearly 700,000 tons of fish worth over  12,000,000. Of this amount more than 300,000 tons were caught outside home waters, and largely in the neighbourhood of the coasts of foreign countries.It is, I think, obvious that no development of the Moray Firth fisheries which could be anticipated could possibly compensate the Nation for .any serious injury to or crippling of our great Trawling Industry.3. Although It has been realised for many years past thatan extension of our exclusive fishery limits beyond 3 miles would prove of value to local fishermen in various parts of England all applications for extensions have been rejected by
i il !my Department because any claim for extended jurisdiction would only serve as an excuse for claims by other nations, which would be to the detriment not only of our fisheries but also of our Mercantile and Naval interests, and it has been the^consistent policy of successive Governments during the past 25 years to restrict our own claims to the narrowest possible limits, and to contest claims of foreign Nations to extend their limits.    It was, no doubt, in pursuance of that policy that the Foreign Office Intervened after the conviction of the Norwegian fisher-men in 1907, and brought about their liberation.The same policy was followed by the Inter-departmental Committee on the Limits of Territorial Waters, and the Imperial Conference In 1925, in the negotiations with Norway in the same year, and at the Hague Conference In 1930.4. There is no reason to doubt that if a claimwere made to regard the Moray Firth as National or Territorial Waters or as exclusive, fishery limits, It would be vseloomed by some of the other powers, because it would afford them a pretext for claiming being in the same category a large number of bays and inlets In Iceland, Faroe and other coutries.It is assumed,JLn the Memorandum of the Secretary of State for Scotland, that these claims would be confined to areas similar in size and configuration to the Moray Firth, but this assumption Is, I venture to think, entirely without foundation.There is at present a rule embodied In the
North Sea and Anglo Danish Conventions, that exclusive fishery limits in bays and inlets are confined to places enclosed by lines not exceeding 10 miles In length.   If Great Britain claims to treat as within exclusive fishery limits an area closed by a line 65 miles long or 6% times the recognised limit, there is no logical reason why other Nations should not adopt a line 10 or even 20 times as long.    In fact the rule would have gone and there would be no rule in its place, and it would be open to the Nations to scramble for what they think is good for them, and there being no longer any rule there is no logical reason why they should confine their claims to bays.5. So far as merits go, there is no material differencebetween the case of the Moray Pirth fishermen and similar CG3imunities of fishermen in other parts of the world. The basis of the claim of the Moray Pirth men is that if the waters adjacent to their homes were made into a private preserve for them, and they were thus protected from the competition of other fishermen, their earnings and their prosperity would be increaF3dj and clearly an equally good claim of the same kind could be made by local fishermen In many places at home and abroad.    If, however, such claims were to be admitted, a large portion of the fishing grounds would be closed to the more enterprising fishermen of all Nations, and particularly those of this Country, who have developed their methods and improved their vessels In order to obtain greater radius of action and more efficient prosecution of their trade.6. The result of a development of this kind uponthe British Trawling Industry would be disastrous, as I
calculate that they might well be deprived of the use of waters in Iceland, Faroe and Russia, from which they now derive almost 100,000 tons of fish, and they might also be excluded in the future from regions elsewhere, which though not fished now, may be exploited in the course of the development of the industry.   My estimate of the loss of catch in Iceland alone amounts to nearly 60,000 tons.   This figure is based upon statistical information in the possession of my Department and their knowledge of the habits of the fishermen, and though it is questioned by the advisers of the Secretary of State for Scotland, I have no reason to doubt that it is substantially accurate.7. I cannot accept the suggestion made In paragraph of the Scottish Memorandum, that any loss which may be sustained through the closing of waters in Iceland and elsewhere can be made up by the greater use of new fishing grounds and new methods of preservation.   The fishing grounds in Northern waters are as yet largely unexplored, but the knowledge which we have so far acquired tends to show that they will not produce certain varieties of fish such as plaice, which form a valuable part of the Icelandic catch and are much in demand in this country. Really satisfactory methods of preserving fish caught in distant grounds have yet to be invented.8. Nor can I accept the contention of the Secretaryof State for Scotland, made in paragraph 9 of his memorandum, that the Moray Firth could properly be claimed upon the basis of being what is known in International Law as a territorial Inlet or historic bay.   Although the principle
of local jurisdiction over such areas has been generally accepted its application has always been applied to areas of a very different configuration to that of the horay Firth, and has also been supported by a case based on historic grounds.     The bays and inlets to which it has been applied have always been of a more or less land-locked nature and of great area in proportion to the size of their entrance; it has never been applied to a bay of the most open description with no definite   headlands, such as the Moray Firth, and moreover the recent history of the Moray Firth is quite inconsistent with either the exercise of de facto jurisdiction over its waters or any continuous claim to do so.9.    The negotiations with Norway and Russia are, I submit, immaterial, firstly because those negotiations were expressly without prejudice to the views of the parties as to the proper extent of territorial waters in International Law, and secondly because the bays and inlets which&apos; were under consideration were of an absolutely different configuration to the horay Firth and possessed a very different history.10. The Memorandum of the Secretary of state for Scotland suggests that advantage should be taken of the proposal of the Netherlands Government that an International Conference should take place for the revision of the North Sea Convention, 1882, to put forward the suggestion that the horay Firth should be regarded as within the exclusive fishery limits of Great Britain.     This question is, of course, not &quot;one of those suggested for discussion by the netherlands Government, and if it were put forward I can see no reason for thinking that that Government would be willing to acoede to the suggestion, for the reason that their
&quot;V*      ij)fdahe*rmen - ,voultx be^eprtved -ci -one^oi &quot;l^e--fishing -grounds which they now use and receive nothing as compensation, owing to the fact that there are on the Dutch coasts no bays which could be reserved for Dutch fishermen.      The same argument applies with even greater force to the German Government, who would see clearly that the closure of the Moray Pirth would lead to the closure of other waters in Iceland and elsewhere in which their trawlers fish, and they would inevitably oppose the suggestion.      On the other hand, the Scandinavian Powers would undoubtedly welcome the opportunity to insist upon reciprocal closures off their own coasts.Thus if we sought for recognition of exclusive fishery limits in the Moray Firth by way of amendment of the ITorth Sea Convention, I foresee that it would be impossible to secure the unanimous agreement of the parties to the Convention to such a proposal, and all that would result would be that we should have thrown away the principle of the ten-mile Bay, for exclusive fishery limits, which has met with general acceptance for many years, and as a result of our having claimed the Moray Firth as exclusive fishery limits we should no longer be in the position to contest similar claims which would inevitably be made in respect of Bays and inlets in other countries irrespective of their size and shape.The Secretary of State for Scotland has referred to the fact that in the Debate on the 3rd June, he was strongly pressed to deal with the question of trawling in the Moray Firth, and no doubt the aim of those who raised the matter was to secure the absolute prohibition of this mode of fishing therein. I amstrongly pressed by the Trawling Industry, which is in
55&apos;4every way the most important branch of the fishing industry of this oountry, to use my influence to prevent any step being taken by claiming the Firth as being National or Territorial Waters,  or within exclusive fishery limits, which could be used by foreign countries as an excuse for excluding our own trawlers from important fishing grounds which are at present open to them.This plea was embodied in a Resolution forwarded to the pri;ae llinister, the Foreign Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and myself, by the British Trawlers1 Federation which represents practically all the steam trawling interests of Scotland as well as of England and -v&apos;ales.The Federation also requested an interview,  and as a result the Secretary for Scotland and I received a Deputation, who urged us most strongly that no step should be taken to close the Moray Firth to trawling in view of the disastrous results which &quot;;ould inevitably be caused to our own trawling industry.IS. The alternative proposal to claim a 13 mile limitput forward in paragraph 14 of the Memorandum of the Secretary of State for Scotland is in -ay opinion even more objectionable than the claim to the Moray Firth as exclusive fishery limits, as it would destroy both the 10-mile rule for bays and the dootrine of the 3 mile limit for open coasts.      The 10-mile bay rule would go because in effect all that part of a bay inside the place where the two 13-mile limits drawn from either side .ieet would be closed and so a 26 mile line would be substituted for one of 10 miles, and we obviously could not insist upon a 3-mile limit on open coasts for other Nations whilst claiming 13 miles for ourselves.     Such a course would give effective support to the claims of other Nations to
extend their own limits whioh it has hitherto been our policy to resist.13. The figures relating to the Moray Firth fishing,furnished by the Secretary of State for Scotland, show that the catches in that region have declined from 25,000 tons in 1889, to 8,000 tons in 1S30 and it is sought to draw therefrom the inference that the reduction was solely or mainly due to the operations of trawlers,      I submit however that the inference - cannot be justified.     The figures themselves show that in 1889, when there were no restrictions whatever upon trawling in the Firth) the catches were larger than they have ever been since.     Partial restriction was imposed in 1890, and the Firth was entirely closed to British trawlers in 1892, but the reduction in the amount of trawling caused by the closure was accompanied by a progressive reduction in&apos; the amount of catches of non-trawling vessels.14. Further, I do not think it can be seriously denied that the main reason for the reduction shown is a change in the habits and methods of the Scottish fishermen themselves. During the period between 1889 and the present time, the application and development of steam and motor power in fishing vessels has taken place, and with it there has been an all-round increase in the size of the vessels.     The result of this has been that the Moray Firth fishermen have gone further and further afield and have spent less time fishing in their home waters.     One example of this is to be found in the enormous increase in the number of vessels and men attending the East-coast herring fishing at Yarmouth.15, In my view, the only logical course, and the onlyone consistent with the interests of the British Fishing Industry as a whole, is to revoke the Byelaw closing the
Moray Firth to trawlers, and to seek &quot;by amendment of the North Sea Convention to strengthen its provisions with regard to the protection of the anchored cod nets.It ..;ust, however, be realised that nothing that can be inserted in the Convention can be effective unless the Moray Firth fishermen themselves take the ordinary seaman-like precautions necessary to indicate the position their nets by means of adequate buoys and lights or by vessels standing by them,  as it is clearly to their failure to take these precautions that a large proportion of the damage inflicted is due.lnistry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 25th July,  1931.
