COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL EXPENDITURE.To the Right Hon. Philip Snowden, M.P., Chancellor of the Exchequer.Sib,APPOINTMENT.On the 11th February, 1931, the House of Commons passed by 468 votes against 21 a resolution That this House consider that, having regard to the present burden of Taxation in restricting industry and employ-ment, the Government should at once appoint a small and independent committee to make recommendations to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for effecting forthwith all practic-able and legitimate reductions in the national expenditure consistent with the efficiency of the services.&quot; Following the passing of this resolution, we were appointed onthe 17th March, 1931 after consultation between all parties withthe following terms of reference &quot; To make recommendations to the Chancellor of the Ex-chequer for effecting forthwith all possible reductions in the National Expenditure on Supply Services, having regard especially to the present and prospective position of the Revenue. In so far as questions of policy are involved in the expenditure under discussion, these will remain for the exclusive consideration of the Cabinet; but it will be open to the Committee to review the expenditure and to indicate the economies which might be effected if particular policies were either adopted, abandoned or modified.&quot; We now beg to submit our report on the matters referred for our consideration.CHAPTER I.INTRODUCTION.1. Retrenchment and Expansion since the War.1. Since 1928, it has been the practice, in tho expenditure state-ment in the annual budget to show separately ordinary expendi-ture, sinking.fund, and self balancing expenditure (i.e. expenditure on the Post Office, and Road Fund). Ordinary expenditure aB thus, understood is the expenditure which, has to be met from tho10902 A 3
national revenue including the profit on the Post Office and tha Exchequers share of the Motor Vehicle Duties. It is only to the extent that revenue exceeds this ordinary expenditure that a balance is available for the redemption of debt. In 1928 certain other adjustments were made in the national accounts designed to eliminate duplicate entries as far as possible. In the table below similar adjustments have been made in earlier years so that.all the figures are on a corresponding basis. The table shows the ordinary expenditure for each year since the war, the amount available for the redemption of debt and the net borrowing or re-payment of debt by the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.

Gorernment. In the year beginning lsi April, 1921, about  4(5,500,000 aud in the year oeginuing 1st April, \\)T2, about  20,000,000 of interest payments were B&apos; spended.2. From 1921 to 1924 the course of ordinary expenditure was rapidly downwards; from 1924 to 1928 there was no striking change in the total; whilst from 1928 onwards, there has been an abrupt rise, the difference between the audited expenditure for 1928 and the original estimates for 1931 being, no less than  67,000,000.    .But the figure of .- 07,000,000 understates the true increase in the national burdens, for the pound sterling is worth more in services and goods in 1931 than in 1928. The Ministry of Labour index of cost of living has fallen from a total index of 164 on 1st April, 1928, to 147 on 1st April, 1931 (July, 1914    100): the Board of Trade index of wholesale prices
has fallen between May, 1928, and May, 1931, from 143.6 to 104.4 (1913 = 100). It would be unreasonable to expect that the national expenditure should fall fully in proportion to changes in the price level since it contains many items not responsive to such changes. But some items are affected by falling price levels and to that extent the real increase in Government expenditure is greater than  67,000,000,3. If account be taken not only of the budget expenditure but also of the loan operations of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme the change in the situation between 1928 and 1931 becomes still more serious, for whereas in 1928 the Scheme borrowed  11,430,000, it is now estimated to need roughly  50,000,000 in 1931. In addition, borrowing to the extent of  9,000,000 is anticipated this year to meet the needs of the Road Fund. Borrowing for the Unemploy-ment Fund alone in 1930 ( 36,440,000) almost wiped out the net surplus in the year of  43,600,000. For the current year the total borrowing for unemployment insurance and the Road Fund together is likely to be considerably in excess of the amount avail-able for redemption of debt.4. The history in broad outline of the main financial decisions taken between 1921 and 1931 throws much light on the above figures. The slump which followed the short-lived post-war boom created a wave of public opinion in favour of economy. This came to a head in the enquiry of the Geddes Committee (which presented its final report on 21st February, 1922), but both before and after this enquiry large reductions were made in expenditure. In 1924, a policy of expansion and development replaced the policy of retrenchment. Additional commitments were undertaken in a number of directions including education, an ambitious housing scheme and extendedi old age pensions, and a programme of cruiser building which had been for some time under consideration. In 1925, the policy of expansion continued with the grant of Widows&apos; Pensions and the Beet Sugar Subsidy. A further naval building programme was begun and an increased State con-tribution was provided for the Unemployment Fund. The danger of strife in the coal industry was averted for a time by a heavy subsidy. The items named are given as illustrations rather than as a comprehensive list. New commitments soon reached a large total, and with the prospect of a difficult Budget position in 1926 retrenchment once more came to the front. A White Paper pre-sented to Parliament on 16th March, 1926, showed that estimates in 1926 were likely to exceed the original estimates for 1925 by as much as  34,747,000 of which  24,447,000 was due to decisions of the then Parliament and Government, and  8,250,000 to the development of schemes approved by previous Parliaments and Governments.   The balance of the increase, viz.  2,050,000, which. .10905A. 4&apos;
was the net increase shown on a number of items, was largely- auto-matic in character. In so far as the economies then decided upon in-volved legislation they were embodied in the Economy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1926, which was estimated to produce a benefit to the Exchequer of from  8,310,000 to  10,160,000 in 1926 and from  7,030,000 to  8,880,000 in 1927. At the moment it appeared that the difficulties of the Exchequer had been surmounted, but the coal stoppage and the national strike that followed had grave reactions both on expenditure and revenue and the pressure for economy continued throughout 1926 and 1927.5. The economies of these years, however, produced little in the way of continuing reductions of expenditure. A number of the savings made were special measures which from their nature could not be repeated or were merely postponements of expenditure. The largest continuing item, viz. the reduction of the State contribution to the Unemployment Fund made in 1926, as events have proved, reduced the Exchequer charge but only by increasing the borrowings of the Fund to the same extent.r 6. After this period, retrenchment was again relegated to the back-ground. The Derating Scheme imposed on the State a heavy burden, consisting partly of relief to certain classes of ratepayers and partly of larger Exchequer grants to local authorities. It should, however, be pointed out that except to the extent that the relief given to local authorities may have led them to increase their expenditure, this scheme was merely a shifting of part of the burden of, government from ratepayer to taxpayer and not an addition to the total burden.7. In 1929, further new expenditure was sanctioned, and a reply given in the House of Commons on 17th November, 1929, stated that the main, financial commitments entered into since 1st June, 1929, viz., increased State contribution to the Unemployment Fund, the assumption by the Exchequer of the charge for Transitional Benefit, Widows&apos; Pensions, Agriculture, Forestry, Civil Service bonus concession, proposed raising of school leaving age, Housing, paid holidays to Civil Service industrial staff and concessions on pay and retired pay of Army, Navy and Air Force officers, involved an estimated additional expenditure of  8,243,000 in 1929 and  18,967,000 in 1930. A reply to a Question in the House ot Commons on 23rd April, 1931, gave the expenditure involved in commitments entered into by the present Government as  14,086,000 in 1931 in addition to  30,000,000 for transitional benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.,2. Estimated Expenditure in 1932 and 1933.8. Any review of the course of expenditure since the War would be incomplete without some estimate of the future liabilities that have been undertaken.   Some items are capable of close estimating :
others not, e.g. the large payments to the Unemployment Fund depends on the future course of unemployment. As regards this item, however, it can be said that, if the existing scheme is con-tinued unaltered, any improvement in employment would at first probably make itself felt mainly in a reduction of ordinary benefit from the Fund thus lessening the amount borrowed by the Fund without reducing the Exchequer charge materially. For the purposes of the estimates which follow, we have therefore taken the cost of transitional benefit for 1932 and 1933 at the probable figure for 1931, viz.,  35,000,000.9. On the best estimates we can frame, if existing policies remain unaltered, the total ordinary expenditure in 1932 will be about  12,000,000 and in 1933 about  17,000,000 higher than the original estimates for 1931. These figures, however, include nothing for the schemes of expenditure, some of serious magnitude, now under consideration, whether by the Government or by Par-liament. The&apos; present position is rather obscm-e, but we would recall the financial memoranda presented to Parliament in con-nection with the Education (School Attendance) Bill and the Agri-cultural Land (Utilisation) Bill. The total annual expenditure from public funds involved in the Education Bill was put i at  6,250,000, of which  4,350,000 per annum was to fall on the Exchequer, and the Agricultural Land Bill was drawn without any financial limit on its most important item, viz., the provision of small holdings. In addition to these major bills, the aggregate cost of schemes now under consideration for Agricultural Market-iug, Rural Housing, improved Maternity Service, and a number of minor services is considerable.10. Excluding such proposals, the main services on which changes are to be expected in 1932 and 1933 are as follows :  	Increase	IncreaseExisting Services.	1932	1933 .Increases.	over 1931.	over 1931	 	 Agriculture ...	200,000	300,000Education  ...	..     2,550,000	5,500,000Old) Age Pensions ...	1,500,000	3,000,000Widows&apos; Pensions	..     1,000,000	2,000,000Housing	..     1,100,000	2,300,000Navy	2,700,000	2,700.000Transitional Benefit	..     5,000,000	5,000,000(The original estimate for 1931 was . 30,000,000 while the revised esti-mate will probably be  35,000,000.)Total Increases14,050,00020,800,000

Future Liabilities Generally.11. The consideration we have so far given to the finance of post-war years has been based mainly on the budget position. The budget is, however, only a statement of cash transactions in each financial year, and it gives no indication of the liabilities involved in services which do not mature for payment within the year. To complete the picture of the years under review, it is necessary to consider the trend of long-term commitments undertaken in those years.   The result is most disquieting.The items we propose to consider fall into three broad groups.12. In the first place, there are services financed through loans or by subsidies based on loans. This method of finance commits future taxpayers to subsidies for services whose cost is now being met by borrowing, and to that extent restricts the field in which economy is possible. The present value of future subsidies is a considerable sum. The total for Housing subsidies alone has now reached  218,000,000, and for grants so far made on the recom-mendation of the Unemployment Grants Committee  45,000,000. There are a number of other cases the outstanding cost of which we have not evaluated (School Building grants, Small Holdings and so on). These outstanding subsidies are intractable items in the national expenditure, and even if the services were immediately closed down, the taxpayer must continue for many years to provide large sums annually to liquidate past commitments.13. The second group consists of the charges for pensions to ser-vants of the State and of local authorities. A pension liability is incurred during service; it only matures for payment at the end of service. When a service expands, or when salaries are increased, the full corresponding pension liability only emerges many years later.. . :&apos;K-&quot;,:v:.- .14. It is of assistance in this connection to compare the position of a commercial undertaking which accords pension rights to its staff. &apos; It may do so by paying premiums to an Insurance Com-pany. Or it may set up its own pension fund and pay into it annually the proper sum calculated on an actuarial basis to meet its future liabilities&apos;;&apos; In either ease it is generally regarded as pro-viding adequately for the pension liability.     But the national
schemes are not on these lines; on the contrary, the State accords pension rights to its staff and merely pays the pensions as they arise. At the start these charges are light and the pension scheme may be considered to run cumulatively into debt each year to the extent that its actual payments fall short of the sums which it should have set aside on actuarial principles.15. In the case of Civil Servants, police and teachers, the accruing-ing pension liability of the Exchequer is estimated to exceed the sum which is actually now being paid in pensions by as much as  5,000,000,  1,000,000 and  8,000,000, a year, respectively. We have not been able to obtain a comparable figure for the Fighting Services.16. Our third group consists of War Pensions and of the Social Services, in particular Old Age and Widows&apos; Pensions. The liability for War Pensions is steadily declining. The present cost of Old Age Pensions to persons over 70 is much less than the ulti-mate cost, as for a variety of reasons the aged population of this country is likely to increase for many years to come. In the case of Contributory Pensions also (widows and persons aged 65 to 70) the number of beneficiaries will increase, with a consequent inci&quot;ease of the liabilities, but in addition the immediate cost to the Exchequer in this case has been kept down by the expedient of using the initial accumulation of contributions to meet the cost of pensions in the earlier years of the schemei though this un-fortunate feature of the original scheme has been considerably re-duced by the amending Act in 1929.17. The bearing on future finance of the second and third groups of services we have considered is worth examination. In all the cases we have cited except War Pensions there is an accruing liability greater than the current charge. To the extent of the excess there is here an uncovered liability which on any proper system of accounting must be regarded as a direct set off to the Sinking Fund. Over the services in question the Government Actuary has estimated that for the last five years our accruing liabilities even after the decline in the liability for War Pensions has been allowed for may have exceeded the provision we have made by as much as  100,000,000, i.e., an average of  20,000,000 a year. In other words, we are at present enjoying benefits for which we are not providing the cost. To the extent of about  20,000,000 a year we are leaving that cost to posterity.18. The bearing of all the charges we have considered in this discussion of future liabilities on the possibilities of economy is easily seen. Future revenue is mortgaged for many years to pay off the capital cost of services which we are now enjoying. Future revenue is also mortgaged to meet the growing cost of continuing services which are now being enjoyed for less than the true cost. Only with an increasing revenue can we continue to provide even our existing services without additional taxation.
19. In estimating the prospects of such increase of revenue being steadily realised, two weighty considerations must not be lost sight of. First, the charges we have considered are practically all fixed in terms of money. If there is a further decline in the price level they will become a proportionately heavier burden on the national revenue, since that revenue itself reflects the price level in important items and will contract still more with a further fall in prices. Secondly, we have to face in the future the probability of a retardation in the increase, and ultimately of a decline, in our population at the working ages. The Government Actuary has estimated that while at present for every 100 persons between the ages of 15 and 65 there are 23 persons over 65 years of age, in 30 years&apos; time there will probably be 33 and in 50 years&apos; time 38. Thus, the working population of the future, in addition to meeting that part of the liability for which provision has not been made by the present generation, will have to support a much larger pro-portion of pensioners.4. Factors, Political and Economic, In the Present Situation.20. Reviewing the course of national finance since the war one cannot fail to notice how unequal is the continual struggle between expansion and retrenchment. One Government, one Parliament can embark on schemes which for all practical purposes definitely commit future Governments, future Parliaments as far ahead as one can look. With some schemes not only are the main lines permanent, but so strong are the contractual or moral obligations involved that any modification in the direction of economy is a difficult matter. But no Government or Parliament can bind its successors to economies. A few Cabinet decisions, a few Votes of Parliament, and all the savings achieved with much labour over a period of years may easily be dissipated.21. So heavily loaded are the dice in favour of expenditure that no representation we can make is more important than to emphasize the need for caution in undertaking any commitments of a continuing character. This need has long been recognised in the national machinery of financial control in the admirable Standing Order of the House of Commons that it will not &quot; pro-ceed upon any motion for a grant or charge upon the public revenue .... unless recommended from the Crown &quot; ; in the pre-eminence of the Treasury among Departments; in the method of preparation and presentation of estimates and in the checks on the levying of new taxation; but we must regretfully admit that particularly since the war this machinery has been lamentably neutralised by circumstances outside its control.22. The-oause is not far to seek. After the heavy sacrifices of the war large sections of the nation looked to the post-war period with
the natural expectation of a general improvement in the old con-ditions of life. The disappointment of many hopes in the economic sphere seemed to intensify demands for improvements from political action and all parties have felt the insistent pressure for promises of &quot; reforms &quot; as the price of support, such &quot; reforms &apos;-&apos; being in fact mostly of the nature of privileges or benefits for particular classes at the cost of the general taxpayer. The results of this pressure are to be seen not only in the lavish promises contained in the election addresses of the period since the war but in the undertakings freely? given by individual Parliamentary candidates to sections of the electorate. At election times those desiring increased expenditure on particular objects are usually far better organized, far more active and vocal than those who favour the vague and uninspiring course of strict economy ; and as a result candidates hot infrequently find themselves returned to Parlia-ment committed, on a one-sided presentation of a case, to a course which on fuller knowledge they see to be opposed to (the national interests. Especially serious&apos; is this danger at the present time when the&quot; mass of the electorate still does not appreciate the true economic position of the country and its problems.23. Had we still been living in the pre-war period of growing pro-sperity and rising revenue, with national taxation absorbing but a comparatively small part of the annual income of the people, such a development in the working of our political machinery, though undesirable at any time, might not have had serious readiness-tions. Par different has been the post-war position with its un-precedented trade stagnation, heavy unemployment, falling price level, and declining incomes under a system of taxation which appropriates year by year an unduly large proportion of the national income. It is only now that the nation is beginning to realise the true character of our post-war problem. Only now when we are experiencing a widespread trade depression are we learning to appreciate the fact that what our basic industries have been suffering from&apos;-for nearly ten years is not a periodical and passing slump such as we encountered in pre-war days, but a1 deep-seated malaise arising from radical re-adjustments of world economy. We are at last awaking to the fact that the cure is not to be found in the temporary and limited stimulus afforded by relief works, but in a resolute grappling with the fundamental problems of each industry, in a frank recognition of i&apos;w6&apos;rld&apos;Changes that are irreversible and in a re-alignment of our economic &quot;life&apos;to meet them.24. The economic disequilibrium from which the world at large is suffering at the present time is so many sided, so deep-seated and so extensive that an immediate and rapid recovery is hardly to be&quot;expected. &apos; Arid the features peculiar to this country are such that even a general world revival of trade may still find us \vr&apos;esilih&apos;g with our own&apos; special&apos; difficulties.
25. If this short diagnosis of our post-war economic troubles is correct our great need has been, and still is, to concentrate all our available energy and resources on re-establishing our competitiTe position in the world. We have been apt to forget that the first thing needful is to secure a return to general prosperity. This alone will go a very long way towards solving most of the problems that have been claiming the unremitting attention of Governments and Parliaments and embarrassing the national finances since the war. The general effect of Government action, national and local, since 1924 has been to add to the national burdens. These have now attained to such a proportion of the total national income that they must be considered definitely restrictive of indus-trial enterprise and employment. In this connection we would refer to the introductory words of (the practically unanimous reso-lution of the House of Commons which led to our appointment, quoted at the beginning of this report.5. The Task before the Committee.26. It is in the light of these conclusions that we turn to the task before us. We have on the one hand to consider present and prospective revenue and on the other the future course of expendi-ture. Some information in regard to probable expenditure in 1932 has already been given on page 9. This shows an estimated increase over the budget estimates for the current year of  12,000,000. This estimate is on the basis of the continuance of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme unaltered and of existing policies in other directions. No allowance is made for any supple-mentary estimates as in the absence of new decisions of policy it should be possible to meet any incidental excesses which arise in the course of the year from savings. On this basis the national expenditure for 1932, apart from the Post Office and the Road Fund, would be  815,366,000.27. We cannot, however, regard this figure as giving a true picture of the national burden for 1932. The exclusion of the Road Fund from the total on the ground that it is like the Post Office, a &quot; Self-balancing Service,&quot; was justifiable as long as the income of the Fund was adequate to meet its liabilities. This is no longer the case. In the current year the Fund is estimated to borrow  9,000,000 from the Exchequer : next year it is expected to need  10,000,000 more. The prospect of repayment is dealt with in detail later in our report, but we will anticipate our conclusions there set out so far as to state that in our view this borrowing must be regarded as a revenue liability.28. We are drawn to a similar conclusion in regard to the antici-pated borrowing of the Unemployment Fund in 1932 under axist-ing arrangements. Apart from the heavy charge for Transitional Benefit which falls direct on to the Exchequer the revenue of the Fund from the contributions of the State, employers and employed,.
will fall far short of its liabilities for ordinary benefit. At the beginning of last April it was borrowing at the rate of  55,000,000 a year. Since that date there has been some transfer from ordinary to transitional benefit, but the Eund is still borrowing at little less than  1,000,000 a week. By the end of the current financial year, the debt will be considerably over  100,000,000. Whatever view may be held of the prospect of repayment of the existing debt, we cannot regard any loan from the Exchequer which may be necessary in 1932, estimated on the present scheme to amount to  40,000,000, as other, than an irrecoverable advance. Borrow-ing for such purposes is in reality adding to the national debt- to relieve current revenue charges and is opposed to the principles of sound finance hitherto accepted without question in this country. We recommend that it be discontinued after this year. The total of these items represents an additional expenditure to be met from revenue in 1932 as compared with 1931 of no less than  62,000,000.29. What of the revenue? No one will1 be surprised in view of our previous remarks if we state at the outset that any appreciable increase in the main taxes on enterprise in 1932 could only aggra-vate present difficulties. Yet the revenue prospects are not re-assuring. The Budget of 1931 has been balanced largely with the aid of &quot; nest-eggs.&quot;  20,000,000 is being obtained from the capital of the Exchange Account and  3,000,000 from the excess of the assets of that Account over its liabilities.  10,000,000 is being provided by acceleration of payment of Income Tax under certain Schedules and the  4,000,000 drawn from the Eating Relief Suspense Account exhausts that Account. None of this  37,000,000 will be available in 1932, and the gap between expenditure and revenue is thus widened to  99,000,000.30. So far we have dealt with facts which can be definitely allowed for. When we turn to other items of revenue more un-certainty arises. The Income Tax of 1932 will be assessed on the profits of 1931, and those profits will undoubtedly be substantially lower than the profits of 1930 on which the Income Tax of 1931 ia based. What the reduction will be no one can foretell, but after reviewing available data we think it would be unsafe to assume that it will be less than  20,000,000. If, in regard to other items of revenue, we make the fairly optimistic assumption that receipts in 1932 will in the aggregate equal the Budget estimates of 1931 we are left with the position that to produce a properly balanced budget in 1932 including the usual provision for the redemption of debt a deficiency of the sum of  119,000,000, say  120,000,000,* has to be made good by fresh taxation or by economy, apart from any further liabilities that may be incurred under pending legis-lation. , ,&apos;* This report takes no account of any adjustments! in the national accounts which may he necessitated by the moratorium on reparations and war debts how under consideration.
31. For present purposes one of the most important conclusions to be drawn from our diagnosis of the financial situation is that this gap of  120,000,000 is no transient feature to be bridged by tem-pprary expedients. If it were, our task would be comparatively easy. Many classes and interests are readily prepared in a national emergency to accept a temporary surrender of what they conceive to be their just rights; the postponement of all works whether of a capital or of a maintenance character is a common method in everyday life of tiding over a passing stringency; while there may still be found in secluded thickets of the national accounts a few &quot; nest eggs &quot; that for one reason or another have not yet been dis-disturbed and might possibly be available to make some small non-recurrent addition to the revenue side of the budget. Not so in our view can the present position be controlled. We fear that the country must face the disagreeable fact that its public ex-penditure and in this we include local as well as national expen-diture is too high and that it must be brought down to a lower level. It may be that in thinking that a policy of strict economy will be necessary for some years to come we are unduly pessimistic and that the recuperative powers of the world and the resilience of our national character in periods of grave emergency will prove to be such that difficulties which now appear extremely grave will be rapidly overcome. This possibility does not however in the least alter our view as to the wise and prudent course to take now. Relaxations of conditions, increases of expenditure, expan-sions of services are easy and popular and can be swiftly effected should the wheel of fortune turn in our favour. Should however the trend of events become even more adverse, economies and sacrifices will prove to be far more valuable, far more effective if made at once than if we wait till they and perhaps many more  are forced upon us by.the pitiless march of events.32. When we come to face our task in detail it is inevitable that we should find that the chief opportunities of reduction are to be found in the services of most rapid and recent growth. There are three reasons for this. First, the older commitments of the State have stood the test of many attacks and in the main! have proved that they are unavoidable even in years of depression. Secondly the longer expenditure has been running, the more rights and vested interests have grown up around it. Thirdly it is a powerful argu-ment in regard to any service to say that the nation did without it a few years ago, therefore it cannot be essential. This line of thought however leads us into some difficulty in regard to proposals now under consideration, whether by Departmental Ministers, the Cabinet or Parliament itself. We would have preferred that our task should have been limited to the expenditure now being in-curred under decisions of the past without our being forced into expressing any opinion on questions of the day, and yet again and again in the course of our enquiry we have been faced with the
57difficulty of going back upon past decisions. They have created expectations, moral rights and sometimes even contractual and legal liabilities. In many instances the mistake made in faking the original decision is now irremediable. Seeing this, we feel that we should be failing in our duty if while doing all in our power to reduce present expenditure we took no cognizance of proposals now under discussion for increasing it.6. The National Expenditure considered in more detail.33. We append to this report a classification of the national ex-penditure prepared by the Treasury by reference to the. services or objects on which the money is spent. These figures differ from those in the Estimates and Appropriation Accounts first, in that all payments on a particular service have as far as possible been collected irrespective of the particular vote on which they are pro-vided, and secondly, that in view of the altered financial position of the Road Fund, already referred to, we have included payments therefrom in the national expenditure.34. The Table divide the expenditure into two parts, i.e. &apos;(1) Expenditure on services directly administered by the Government;(2) Grants towards services administered by other bodies, mainly local authorities.In regard to the former class the responsibility of the Govern-ment for the cost of the services is direct and complete; in regard to the latter the national accounts only cover a part of the total cost and however much the Government may share in the control, it has not itself the direct administrative responsibility.35. The expenditure in these groups analysed under the more im-portant heads is shown below for the current year (budget esti-mates) and 1924, when it reached its lowest post-war level. In the second group an adjustment has been made in the item Ex-chequer Contributions to Local Revenues allocating to the education and police services respectively, grants paid from this head in 1924 and now directly charged on the Votes (under the Local Government Acts, 1929) :-I.

These tables will repay careful study. The first one shows reductions amounting to  38,100,000 spread over every item except Old Age and Widows&apos; Pensions and Unemployment and Health Insurance where there is an increase of  54,600,000. In the second table there are no reductions. The increases may be grouped under three heads (1) Grants for various purposes of national development.(2) Grants for Social Services.(3) Other grants.Of the  33,700,000 increase under Exchequer Contributions to Local Revenues  26,8000,000 represents the cost of the rating relief given to industry and agriculture, and may fairly be included in the first category above. The balance may be regarded in the main as given in respect of social services Carried out by local authorities. The bulk of the grants for unemployment works may also be
regarded as given for national development. If this division be made the increases in the three groups become : (1) Home Development.    Derating.........      ...   26,000,000Roads.........      ......   L7,900,000Agriculture     ............    2,100,000Grants for Unemployment Works ...       100,000---   46,100,000(2) Social Services.

Thus of the total increases shown in the tables in para. 85 of  125,400,000 (viz.: Pensions and Insurance  54,600,000 and Grant Services  70,800,000), about  76,700,000 (viz.: Pensions and Insurance  54,600,000 and Education, Housing, etc.,  22,100,000) may be regarded as in respect of Social Services and  46,100,000 in fespect of Home Development. Other grants account for an increase of  2,600,000 and all other main groups show a reduction. If allowance be made for probable increase ot the Exchequer grant to unemployment insurance this year by  5,000,000 owing to the extension of the transitional benefit period, the total of increases reaches  130,000,000 of which roughly  80,000,000 is accounted for by Social Services and  46,000,000 by Home Development.7. The Arrangement of the Report.38. Following the general lines of the above classification of expenditure we have divided the remainder of our report into the following main sections :--Chapter   II.   Civil Service Administration.III. Pay and Pensions (Civil Servants, FightingServices, Police and Teachers).IV. Defence (Navy, Army and Air Force).
Chapter V. Development Expenditure Research, Road Fund, Department of Overseas Trade, Relief of Rates on.Industry and Agriculture, Agriculture, Beet Sugar Subsidy, Forestry, Empire Marketing Board, Colonial De-velopment, Colonial and Middle Eastern Services, Unemployment Grants and De-velopment (Public Utility) Grants. VI. Social Services (Unemployment and Health Insurance, Widows&apos; and Old Age Pensions, Housing and Education). ,, VH. Miscellaneous Services (War Pensions, British Broadcasting Corporation and Ex-chequer Contributions to Local Revenues). VIII. Summary of Recommendations and Con-clusion.39. At the outset of our deliberations, two considerations became evident. First, that a detailed enquiry would take a long time. The field of Government expenditure, including as it does the Fighting Services, the Post Office, Revenue Departments, some 124 Civil Votes, several of considerable complexity, and a number of special funds could only be scrutinised in detail if many months, running possibly to,years,.of labour were devoted to the task.Secondly, that the financial situation demands that steps to reduce expenditure substantially should be taken immediately. The Budget Speech delivered shortly after we began our enquiry showed that great hope was being placed on the outcome of our delibera-tions to ease the difficulties of next year&apos;s budget. It is almost inevitable that many of our proposals would involve legislation, and if they are to be fully effective iii 1932 there is clearly ho time to lose.40. At an early stage in our enquiry we came to the conclusion that we ought to concentrate our attention in the main on selected aspects of the national expenditure with a view to producing as -comprehensive a report as possible before the Summer Recess. There are many issues of great financial moment demanding imme-diate attention from a Committee on expenditure; there are other questions, which in the public mind are thought to present great opportunities for economy such as the creation of a Ministry of Defence or a large reduction in the personnel of the Civil Service, which we cannot ignore. But as regards the general field of Government activity any large reduc-tion of expenditure is hardly to be expected in view of the efforts to reduce administration costs in recent years. All the large Departments have during and since the War been examined in-dividually by Committees who have spent some months on each subject, but more important than any ad hoc enquiry has been the day to day scrutiny of the Treasury and the working of the system of internal financial control in each Department.     We have
nevertheless pursued our enquiries into the general field so fair as to satisfy ourselves that we were not Overlooking substantial possi-bilities of economy alternative to those we recommend. We have given consideration through Sub-Committees to all the Supply Votes and we have discussed thosa in which any savings appeared possible with officers of the Treasury and, in some cases, of the Departments concerned. While we do not say that on these smaller votes there is no opportunity for economy, we are satisfied that if all possible savings were made, the maximum sum there available would be relatively insignificant compared with the total economy we regard as essential.In order to shorten our report as much as possible we have not, as a rule, considered it necessary to deal with services in regard to which we do not submit any recommendation.CHAPTER II.CIVIL SERVICE ADMINISTRATION.41. The Civil Service numbered in 1930-31 about 443,200 persons. Industrial workers (e.g. Dockyard and Arsenal Work-men, Post Office Linesmen, Office of Works Constructional and Maintenance Workmen, Stationery Office Printing Staffs) number 122,400 Manipulative staffs (Post Office Sorters, Postmen, Tele-graphists and Telephonists) number 180,800.The balance of 140,000 contains 17,200 Messengers, Porters, Charwomen etc., 8,400 Typists and Shorthand Typists, 29,700 Writing Assistants, Temporary Clerks, etc. leaving 84,700 as the number of Clerical, Executive and analogous staffs, Consular Diplo-matic and Administrative Officers, Professional, Scientific and Technical Staffs, Inspectorates, etc.42. The possibilities of economy in the field of Civil Service Administration depend on : (a) the rate of pay.(b) the necessity for the existence of some of the Depart-ments.(c) the efficiency of the organisation.We shall deal with the first of these three points in a separate section of our report. Our recommendations On the second are necessarily made under the individual Departments. We propose here to deal with the third, and to look at the administrative costs of the Civil Service.
43. Anyone who has had experience of business organisation will know that detailed and continuous scrutiny is necessary (except perhaps where there is flagrant extravagance of management) to achieve savings in administrative costs. In any ordinary business, which is reasonably well run, an investigator can only find the points at which improvement of organisation is possible by actually living in the office for some time. Even then, the savings are probably individually small and a long time elapses before they amount to an appreciable total. Any such investigation is quite beyond our scope, and we have approached the subject not by trying to make individual investigations but by examining the machinery of control with a view to considering its efficiency for its purpose.44. The post war theory of control of Civil Service organisation rests on active co-operation and goodwill between the Treasury on one hand and the Department on the other. They are jointly trustees for the efficient and economical administration of the service. In the Treasury there has been since 1919 an Establishments Depart-ment which has specialised in questions of organisation of Depart-ments, personnel and remuneration, superannuation and so on. In the Departments, responsible officers have been appointed directly answerable to the Head of the Department on questions of office management. For a number of years now there has been going on a regular overhaul of staffs by Establishment Officers aided by advice and assistance from the expert&apos; Department of the Treasury. The process is not spectacular but it is continuous and effective. We do not believe it would be claimed that the administration of the Civil Service is perfect. Necessarily with changing policies, increases of work in some directions and de-creases in others, the machine cannot always adapt, itself immedi-ately to change of policy. But we are satisfied that the method of control adopted is well calculated to maintain a high standard of administration, and that such economies as are from time to time possible will be secured as opportunities arise and will not be accelerated by any recommendations which we could make.45. We are confirmed in these conclusions by an examination of particular examples. The staff of the Department of Overseas Trade was reduced from 640 to 400 in 1921 and kept round that figure until 1929. The Foreign Office Staff (including the Passport Office) was steadily brought down from 843 in 1925 to 732 in 1930. The Ministry of Transport staff of 741 on 1st April 1921 stood at about 600 from 1926-1929. The staff of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of 1,402 in 1921 was progressively reduced to 1,158 in 1928. This list is by no means exhaustive-it merely contains typical examples of progressive staff reduction.46. reference should be made here to one particular form of staff economy, viz., the substitution of mechanical devices for routine labour.   In this respect, we believe the Civil Service to compare
576favourably with the best organisations in British industry. Dur-ing the last five years, as much as nearly  500,000 has been saved annually in some twelve of the largest Departments by the intro-duction of labour-saving machines.47. This is not to say that the total of the Civil Service has been reduced. On the contrary, new duties are constantly being im-posed on the Civil Service and the reductions carefully and labori-ously achieved year by year are frequently undone by a single Act of Parliament or Ministerial decision. Most of the decreases re-ferred to in paragraph 45 have m fact been subsequently swept away in subsequent increases. The Anderson Committee in 1923 reached the conclusion that the immense increase in the Civil Service pay roll had been imposed on the taxpayer for reasons which commended themselves to various Parliaments before and since 1914 and that no power except Parliament could materially reduce the load. We reach the same conclusion to-day. We believe that the Civil Service is economically organised to carry out the duties which Parliament has imposed upon it. Only Parliament can reduce the burden of those duties.48. And the cost of carrying out those duties is increased by the special handicaps under which the Oivil Service labours. We do not think it is generally appreciated how many restrictions hinder the free working of the Civil Service machine. Ex-Service men receive preferential treatment a policy which departs from the former policy of selection solely by competence. The insatiable thirst of members of Parliament and the public for all sorts of detailed information necessi-tates the keeping of statistics more elaborate than are necessary outside the service. Parliament, through the Public Accounts Committee, prescribes by long tradition standards of accuracy and of procedure in matters of accounting which may be desirable in principle but are the reverse of simple in practice. Clearly a change of. practice under any of these heads would involve serious issues of policy requiring far more detailed consideration than we have been able to give. We understand that considerable progress has been made in recent years in reducing clerical labour due to unnecessary checking and verification of records and accounts. Favourable consideration should in our view be given to carrying this process further.
CHAPTER III.PAY AND PENSIONS.. 49. We propose in this chapter to consider the pay and pensions of all classes of State employees and of those classes of local authorities&apos; employees whose pay and pensions fall partly on the State through the operation of percentage grants. The classes covered by our investigations are : (a) Civil Servants (including temporary staffs and industrial employees);(6) Members of the Fighting Forces;(c) Police;(d) Teachers.50. We have not considered certain special classes who receive salaries from the State such as Ministers of the Crown including the Law Officers and Members of Parliament. We think that the Government and eventually Parliament, which was respon-sible for the setting up of our Committee, must decide what con-tribution if any should be made in the present difficult circum-stances.51. We have also not given detailed consideration to the salaries of the Judiciary and of officers of the Houses of Parliament.The salaries of the former, totalling  475,000 a year are charged on the Consolidated Fund. The salaries of the Judges of the Courts of Justice remain the same as before the war. In the case of County Court Judges in England and Wales, Metropolitan Police Magistrates, Sheriffs and Sheriffs Substitutes in Scotland, etc., the basic salaries are the same as before the war, but they now carry a bonus under the Civil Service cost of living scheme. The bonus varies with the salary and in the case of County Court Judges (basic salary  1,500 a year) is at present  146 8s. 0d., or less than 10 per cent, of salary. Prima facie, the present salaries of the Judiciary do not call for comment by us.52. The salaries of officers of the Houses of Parliament are fixed by the House of Lords Offices Committee and theHouseof Commons Offices Commission respectively. We recommend that in order to ensure that the salaries paid are commensurate with those paid in the rest of the Civil Service for duties of equal responsibility they should in future be subject to the sanction of the Treasury. If the duties of any posts are more or less nominal, the appointments should be made honorary ones.53. This chapter covers a wide and diverse field. Each separate branch of our enquiry has at one time or another been the subject of elaborate investigation by Committees.     In the
577particular case of the Civil Service, a Royal Commission has been investigating its problems for over eighteen months. It is self-evident that in the time at our disposal we have only been able to give the broadest consideration to the difficult and important questions which arise in so large a subject.Nevertheless, notwithstanding the necessity of confining ourselves to general considerations, there are certain salient facts which demand investigation in the light of present conditions.54. The Anderson Committee in their Rejjort dated 25th July, 1923, stated :-&quot; Two general considerations about the pay of State servants occur to us.&quot; On the one hand the State should hold the scales even between its own servants and those through whose enterprises its servants are paid. On the other hand, employees of the Crown would have a real ground for complaint if their pay were related to wages in industry only in the time of low wages. If they do not get pay relative to the boom they must be spared the severity of the slump.The State as a model employer offers security, a pension, a dignified service, and a moderate wage in exchange for the excitement and possibilities of private employment.&quot;This admirable summing-up of the difference between employees of the State and those engaged in private enterprise has been present in our minds in considering whether any, and what, reductions are now necessary.55. We cannot, however, overlook the fact that speaking generally the present basis of pay of all classes within the scope of our review was fixed in 1919 or 1920 when, following victory in the Great War, exaggerated notions were held of the future financial prosperity of this country and when, as the result of a temporary boom in trade, profits and wages had risen, to an uneconomic level only to fall as steeply, except in the sheltered industries, when the inevitable slump followed. It is true that since 1919 and 1920 certain reductions have been made in some cases, but such reduc-tions have in the main consisted of adjustments due to the fall in the cost of living. In certain classes, little or no reduction has occurred and in the others the increased basic remuneration granted in 1919 and 1920 has not been affected. At the same time we recognise that certain classes were, in compai-ison with private employment, underpaid in 1914 and that some adjustment of pay was merited.56. On the other hand, since 1919 those engaged in industry, in-eluding those engaged in business on their own account, have suffered substantial reductions in their income and many un-fortunately have lost their posts after long service without adequate
compensation for loss of office. The security of tenure and pension rights of pensionable State and local authority servants represent, in our opinion, a value measured by ;i substantial percentage of remuneration compared with those engaged in private enterprise who do not enjoy either permanency of employment or pension rights. This factor is one to which material weight must be given when considering the subject under review.57. The change in the cost of living in recent years has caused a considerable change in the relative position of one class of Govern-ment employees and another. When the pay of all the classes under review was considered at varying dates shortly after the war, the cost of living was very high. Pay was fixed at levels very considerably above the pre-war level. In some cases the scheme of pay included a provision for variation up or down as the cost of living fluctuated; in other cases, while provision was made for increases if the cost of living rose, no provision was made for decreases if the cost of living fell.58. During the period since 1920, the cost of living has fallen sub-stantially. As measured by the Ministry of Labour&apos;s index, it reached a peak figure of 176 per cent, above pre-war on 1st November, 1920, and it has fallen to 45 per cent, above pre-war on the 1st June, 1931. In some cases the absence of revision of pay as the cost of living has fallen has placed the classes con-cerned in an increasingly favourable position compared with the classes whose pay has been progressively and automatically ad-justed, and indeed with wage earners generally.59. We do not. suggest that the adequacy of pay can be deter-mined solely by reference to cost of living changes. If one could assume for each particular class that there was a given moment at which their pay was right and that&apos;their proper pay at any other time could be calculated arithmetically by reference to change in cost of living, our task would be an easy one, but in fact a continu-our process of re-assessment of values is always at work. In the Civil Service in particular there have been numerous re-organisations, arbitration awards and the like which have altered the internal relativities and on the average have tended to offset to some extent the reductions due to the fall in the cost of living. In the Fighting Services, lower rates were introduced in 1925 for new&apos;entrants although (speaking&quot; only of officers) the old rates already included provision for cost of living variations. Clearly then, cost of living is not the only criterion.;60. The Anderson-Committee stated that in their view there was only one principle in which all the factors of responsibility, cost of living, marriage, children,; social position, etc., were included-the employer should pay what is necessary to recruit and to retain an efficient staff.   In our view, this is broadly equivalent to the
ordinary &quot; fair wages &quot; basis which is the underlying principle of the pay of State and local authority servants. If, however, in one class the cost of living is taken into account and a substantial cut in pay brought about automatically as the cost of living falls, it cannot be equitable if another class suffers no deduction if at the outset the pay of both classes was fixed on a &quot; fair wages &quot; basis having regard to then existing conditions.61. In the consideration we have given to each of the classes under review we have not had regard solely to cost of living. While considering the different ways in which the classes affected have been treated in respect of that factor, we have also borne in mind the fundamental basis ultimately governing their wages.With this preamble, we turn to the discussion of individual classes, taking first the question of pay (including consideration of the value of pension rights as affecting pay), and leaving for separate consideration later the question of pensions generally.1. CIVIL SERVICE.(Excluding Industrial Employees.)62. The average number of the non-industrial staffs of Govern-ment Departments in 1930-31 was 320,800. Of this number, 47,200 were staff employed part time only in the Post Office service and 800 were employed in the Diplomatic, Consular, Commercial Diplo-matic and Trade Commissioner services. Of the balance of 272,800 as many as 149,100 were employed in the Post Office.63. The remuneration of whole time non-industrial Civil Servants under  2,000 per annum varies with the cost of living. The great majority are under the Cost of Living Scheme introduced as from 1st March, 1920. A smaller number of unestablished staff are under an analogous scheme.The cost of living scheme provides that full compensation for the increased cost of living as determined by the Ministry of Labour index figures is granted on ordinary remuneration up to 35s. a week ( 91 5s. Od. per annum). On remuneration from  91 5s. Od. to  200 a year, approximately 46 per cent, of full compensation is granted on the remuneration above 35s. a week. On remuneration over  200 a year, approximately 35 per cent, of full compensation is granted on the excess over  200. The bonus was originally restricted to a maximum of  750 a year ( 500 for certain of the highest posts in the service). Under a modification of this scheme introduced in August 1921, the bonus payable to officers on salaries of over  500 a year (basic) was substantially reduced. No bonus is now paid which would bring remuneration beyond  2,000 a year.
64. The effect of this scheme is shown in the following table :  Basic Remuneration.	Total remuneration with Bonus paid 1st March&apos; 31st August, 1921 (Peak). (2)	Total remuneration with Bonus now paid. (Cost of living 55). (3)	Percentage fall (3) on (2). (4) &apos;	Percentage increase (3) on (1). (6) 	 	 	Per cent.

The value of this table is discounted, however, by reason of the fact that basic remuneration has not remained constant, and it is clear from consideration of other matters that the cost of living scheme alone cannot be taken as an indication of the changes made in remuneration. It is impossible to disentangle the factors which have contributed to change. The age distribution of the Civil Service is not constant. An abnormal number of men found themselves near the beginning of long incremental scales in 1920 and the ordinary working out of increments has caused a steady increase. The full effects of the increases granted in 1920 were not felt at once. In addition there has been, in many cases, a revision of the basic scales themselves. These factors result in the Civil Servant now being in a better position than a mere comparison of remuneration in 1914 and 1920 would indicate. On the other hand, the average remuneration of the Civil Service has also in-creased through changes m its character and the changes under these heads cannot be regarded as on the same footing as the changes we have just referred to. Recruitment has been largely from ex-service men, and the entry of men on salaries appropriate to adults instead of the entry of recruits at the minima of the Bcales has prevented the increase arising from increments being fully offset by the savings which would have arisen had the wastage been made good by such you tig recruits. A further factor affecting average remuneration is the replacement of routine labour by mechanical devices. The whole position is therefore one of con-fiiderablc complexity, and further exploration is necessary.66. The Anderson Committee recognised that detailed enquiry into particular rates of pay was iinpossiblo for them..  They assumed
that in the Service the internal relativities had been adjusted by the various Pay Committees which had considered the question in different Departments, by the Departments themselves and by the Treasury. They tried to gauge the general standard of remunera-tion by examining certain important rates.We have proceeded on similar lines though, as our subject is much wider than that of the Anderson Committee our treatment must necessarily be on an even broader basis.67. Any detailed treatment of Civil Service remuneration at the present time is also rendered unnecessary by the fact that a Royal Commission on the Civil Service has been sitting for a year and a half and, at the date of preparing this report, is, we understand, about to issue its findings. We presume that amongst other matters they will examine, the general standards of Civil Service remuneration and through their consideration the relativities throughout the service will be brought under further review. We do not feel, however, that the existence of the Royal Commission precludes us from all reference to the Civil Service. The cost of the salaries and wages, excluding the industrial grades, was in 1930 some  66,000,000, and we cannot omit so important an element in Budget costs from our survey of National Expendi-ture. Moreover, we have kept before us as a constant aim the securing of fair and equitable treatment for all the classes we are reviewing, and clearly we could not ensure such fairness if we had omitted the largest class from our survey. We have confined our survey to such examination - as would enable us to appreciate the possibilities on broad lines of Civil Service remuneration as a field for economy.68. We have amplified certain statistics given by the Anderson Committee, and give the average remuneration at various dates of the different big groups in the. service. We think it convenient to reserve the Manipulative and Messenger grades for separate consideration later in this part of our Report.69. We commence with the Administrative Staff, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Staff and Inspectorates, Executive and Clerical Staff and Writing Assistants and Typists. We have added to the Anderson Committee&apos;s statistics for 1914 and 1923 broadly comparable figures for 1930. In order to give a more comprehensive picture of the trend: of post-war remuneration, we have inserted figures for 1921 (when remuneration reached its peak) and for 1931, the. latter figures being based on a cost of living figure of 55 above pre-war.70. A comment should, perhaps, be made on our table. The staff group classifications and the figures appropriate to them for tho years 1914 and 1923 respectively are taken from the, Anderson
Report. Precise information as to the various grades included] in these particular staff group classifications is not now available. The figures shown for 1930 and 1931 may accordingly not be I strictly comparable group for group with the Anderson groups, but the margin of error due to the exclusion of particular grades from one group and their inclusion in some other group is not likely to be considerable.					&quot;&apos;.r-	Adminis-trative.

The conclusions to be drawn from this table are as follows : First, over these grades of the Civil Service there has been a substantial fall in average remuneration since the post-war peak and an appreciable fall in the last year.Secondly, as the higher salaries rose less with the increase in cost of living and proportionately fell less with the drop, the experience of the different grades has not been widely disproportionate except as regards the Executive and Clerical staffs.
72. The disparity in this last grade calls for separate considera-tion. We find that a substantial part of the increase over pre-war and the absence of the same degree of fall as in other classes since the post-war peak is due to the following factors : There has been a large element of recruitment from ex-service men. This operates in two ways. The pay-ment of salaries appropriate to adults for work which before the war was performed by a class containing a large pro-portion of boy clerks necessarily means a big proportionate increase in the average cost per head. Secondly, the ex-service men who entered the clerical class started in the lower range of a long scale of salary and&apos; there has been a steady and appreciable growth due to the annual increments which they have earned in their scales. As many as 18,550 ex-service clerks have been recruited through various clerical competitions since the war and the increasing cost of these men as they have earned increments accounts for a sub-stantial element in the total cost.73. In a stable Civil Service with balanced age distribution, retire-ments of the more highly paid men at the top and recruitment by juniors at the minimum would, other things being equal, keep the cost stationary. The present lack of balance in the Civil Service, due partly to cessation of recruitment during the war, partly to expansion after the war and partly to the special character of the post-war recruitment, must be allowed for in considering the trend of salaries, and we believe that if scientific adjustment could be made for this feature which operates with exceptional effect in the Executive and Clerical grades, it would be found that a great deal of the apparent difference of average of salaries between these grades and the other classes would be explained.74. Having regard to these factors, we do not feel that Civil Service salaries have failed to respond satisfactorily to the fall in cost of living.75. We have also examined tho salaries in another light. We have compared the salaries of large grades, e.g., Typists, Shorthand typists, Clerks, with salaries paid in outside comparable employ-ment. We do not find any marked divergence between the stan-dards of remuneration which obtain and while we think that in some grades notably for the higher ranges of clerical work the remuneration is on the generous side, we do not think that on the whole the remuneration of the Civil Service is out of scale with that determined on the principle of &quot; fair wages &quot;. &apos;In the case of established typists, we are of opinion that the commencing salaries are too high and that some saving would be effected by recruitment -at ah earlier age. !

76. We turn next to the Manipulative grades; and append a table on similar lines to that given on pageNumbers, 1914 1923 1930Manipulative Staffs.177,747 168.50S 184,216 11,975,000 25,011,500 27,165,300  67.4 218.5 148.4 147.5 134.5Per cent. 99.6 38.4Aggregate Salaries and Wages, 1914 ...1923 ... 1930 ...CoBt per head 1914    ...............1921 (bonus based on 165 over pre-war) 1923 (bonus based on 80 over pre-war) 1930 (bonus based on 70 over pre-war) 1931 (bonus based on 55 over pre-war)Percentage increase, 1931 over 1914 ...fall, 1931 on 1921......,, 1931 on 1930 ......77. As regards most of the classes here covered, the rates of pay were settled by a comprehensive arbitration as recently as 1927. In the case of these staffs, we have examined the rates of the largest classes. Our examination leads us to a result similar to that of the Anderson Committee and we think that some of the maximum rates, notably those of Sorters and Telegraphists are on the high side. In the case of the latter grade we think it would be advantageous that the Post Office should consider whether female labour might not) be used a great deal more than at present. Apart from suitability of work, we think that some of the present difficulties of organisation which lead to large numbers of men being simultaneously on their maximum, and thus necessitate a higher maximum than would normally be necessary, would be considerably  eased  by   the   substitution   of   women   for  men.Apart from this criticism, our conclusions on this part of our enquiry do not differ from those we have already expressed on the Administrative and other groups of the Service.78. Lastly, we turn to the Messenger and Cleaner Grades, and again append a table.Messengers, Charwomen, etc.Numbers, 1914........................ 13,2901923 ..................      ...... 19,6781930 ......................... 17,396Aggregate Salaries and Wages,1914 ... 1923 ... 1930 ... 664.200 1,995,300 1,808,000

This group which includes not only Messengers but Porters and Charwomen being more homogeneous than any hitherto con-si dered and more directly comparable with similar employment outside affords a closer test of the application of the fair wages principle than any of the others. We have found on examination a close similarity between the rates inside and outside the service.Summary of Civil Service Remuneration.SO. We wish to emphasise that the comparisons of rates of pay which we have made are mainly with those of employees of Banks, Insurance Companies and Finance Houses who represent the higher standard of employer and that having regard to security of tenure and pension rights, the emoluments of the Civil Servant (with the exception of the higher grades) undoubtedly compare favourably with the reward for corresponding posts in the majority of commercial and industrial undertakings at the present day.81. We feel, however, that the rates of remuneration in outside industry with which comparison is possible are at present in an un-stable condition. The trend of outside rates must in the end deter-mine Civil Service rates and we think that the operation of the Civil Service cost of living scheme should, in conditions such as obtain to-day, be subject to constant scrutiny to ensure that it maintains a fair relativity between Civil Service remuneration and that in those outside employments with which comparison can properly be effected. We observe that- the index figure of cost of living is failing and is now 45 per cent, above pre-war compared with 55 which is the figure now operative for purposes of cost of living bonus, and that consequently further automatic cuts in remuneration are probable and it is on this assumption that our recommendations are made.82. To sum up our consideration of the Civil Service as a whole, we do not find that the general standard of remuneration as tested by its trend since the war and by comparison of the pay of some of the large groups with outside employment is excessive, a progres-sive reduction having been made in accordance with the fall in cost of living.  We do not therefore feel justified in recommending10905b
any reduction on the ground that the average pay ol the Civil Service is unduly high compared with what may be termed a &quot; fair wages basis &quot;.Leave and Hours.83. We would refer to two other matters affecting conditions in the Civil Service which indirectly have a bearing on the subject of pay, viz., leave and hours.Leave.84. The leave granted throughout the Administrative, Executive and Clerical branches of the Civil Service appears to us to be on a generous scale, appreciably higher than that which is normally allowed in outside employment. In the case of the Administrative Class 48 working days are allowed after 10 years&apos; service. In the Executive Class, 36 working days are allowed in the Junior or Training Grade, while in the Higher Grade, leave rises to 48 days after 15 years of service in a grade eligible for 36 days. In the clerical class, 24 days are allowed in the Junior Grade and 36 days in the Higher Grade. Established typists and writing assistants are eligible for 18 days (after 5 years&apos; service, 21 days) and Estab-lished Shorthand typists to 21 days (after 5 years, 24 days). These allowances of leave are additional to the usual public holidays.85. In considering these allowances, however, and in comparing them with the practice in outside employment, it must be remem-bered that the leave regulations are strictly interpreted. Casual absences for any cause other than sickness are reckoned towards the annual leave allowed, while absence on Saturday counts as a full day&apos;s leave.86. We think that even when due allowance is made for the strict interpretation of the Civil Service regulations, the resulting allow-ances are unjustifiably generous. We recommend that the present scale of leave should be cut down by one third, but in such cases, Saturday holidays should be conceded equal to the number of days deducted from the present leave allowance not exceeding one Saturday a month. A Saturday during a period of continuous leave should still rank as a whole day of leave counting against the annual allowance. This change, it appears to us, would secure that a due proportion of ithe longer leave allowances was taken on Saturdays.87. We recommend that the Treasury should determine the precise scope of the application of this recommendation to classes other than the Administrative, Executive and Clerical in the light oi their present allowance of leave. Ultimately this change, if adopted, will lead to economy in staff.
Hours.88. The Report of the Anderson Committee contains the foliow-ing paragraph : &quot; Hours. The Civil Service rule for clerical and higher * grades in London is a seven-hour day, including three-quarters of an hour off for lunch; in the provinces an eight-hour day.&quot; In the higher grades the seven-hour day has little im-portance, as overtime is not paid for and the staff as a whole give generous measure.For the routine clerical classes, the normal attendance should, in our view, be eight hours, including three-quarters of an hour off for lunch.&quot;89. We understand that this recommendation of the Anderson Committee has not been put into force. We are of opinion that further consideration should be given to the subject with a view to the recommendations of the Anderson Committee being adopted.Although the economy in staff will not be mathematically pro-portionate to the increase in hours, some saving must necessarily accrue.2. CIVIL SERVICE.(Industrial Employees.)90. The basis for the regulation of wages in Government Indus-trial Establishments is the Fair Wages Resolution of the House of Commons. This resolution, though applying in terms only to Government contractors, has been extended to all direct employees of the State, and it is the practice to pay wages not less and to give conditions not worse than those operative in the nearest corn-parable industry. In establishments which have direct analogues in the world outside the Public Service, e.g. the Printing Factories of H.M. Stationery Office and the depots of H.M. Office of Works, it is the practice to apply the rates and conditions which operate iu the areas concerned. In the mixed establishments which con-tain several activities which are not to be found so grouped in the outside world, e.g. the Royal Dockyards and the Ordnance Factories, the practice is to follow the trade or industry primarily concerned.91. In 1924, awards by a special arbitration body under Sir Harold Morris and also by the Industrial Court resulted in a 6s. addition to bonus for skilled men, 5s. to unskilled men in the Ord-nance Factories, and 4s. to all Dockyard employees. Since that time 2s. has been added to the bonus figure in the outside engineer-mg industry. By consequence there are at the present time differ-ences of 4s., 3s., and 2s., between the rates paid in the outside10905 b 2
engineering industry and those paid in generally comparable estab-lishments within the Public Service. The differential cost at the present date is approximately  325,000 per annum. We have no desire to disturb the basis on which industrial wages in Govern-ment establishments are regulated but we can see no justification for the continuance of this difference of remuneration which gives more than the acceptance of the &quot; fair wages &quot; basis demands, the Government being regarded as a model employer. We note from the terms of the Mori-is award that the Arbitrator took the view that any increase granted should, if possible, be such that on reconsideration or readjustment, or by effecting further economies, the outside trade might be able to come into line with the Government standard. In the present case, that expectation has not been fulfilled, the outside bonus as we have stated having only been increased by 2s. We recommend that the position under these awards should be reconsidered with a view to the abolition of the preferential bonus. No automatic and progressive wage reductions have taken place as a consequence of the fall in the cost of living in any of the establishments affected by these awards.92. We have noted that under a concession granted in 1929, paid leave of six days a year is now granted in the Ordnance Factories and Royal Dockyards. We are aware that paid leave is granted in outside employment in a number of trades, and that such leave had also been granted for many years in other Industrial estab-lishments under the Government (e.g. in the Post Office, Office of Works, and Stationery Office). It is not, however, the general practice to grant holidays with pay in outside engineering and shipbuilding industry. The cost of the concession made in 1929 is  200,000 a year. &apos;3. FIGHTING- SERVICES.93. New rates of pay of the Fighting Services were fixed in 1919, and the rates then granted represented a substantial increase over the pre-war rates. In the case of officers, pay as then fixed was made subject to variation as the cost of living fluctuated. In the case of men, no provision was included for a change of rate. We might here, however, remark at the outset that both officers and men receive allowances in addition to pay which are provided either in kind or at a cash equivalent, and inasmuch as the value of these allowances varies with commodity prices, the total re-muneration includes a variable factor on this account in addition to the variation, which is made, in the case of officers, in their pay-94. The 1919 rates were reviewed in 1923 by the Anderson Gom-mittee which found that the rates of pay of the rank and file and
583of the lower ranks of officers were more than were necessary. Detailed consideration was given by a Cabinet Committee to the revisions to be made in the rates and in 1925 new rates were promulgated for the ranks in question. In the case of officers, the new rates include a provision for variation as the cost of living fluctuates analogous to the provision to this effect included in the 1919 rates.95. The new rates took effect from the 1st, 5th and 26th Octo-ber, 1925, for the Air Force, Navy a/nd Army respectively, but they were applied only to new entrants to the Services on or after those dates. There are thus now in operation in each of the Services two distinct scales of pay.96. The problem which faces the Committee is twofold (a) are the rates fixed in 1925 justified to-day, and (b) should action be taken as regards those officers and men who were serving before October, 1925, and who in consequence still draw the 1919 rates.97. The rates introduced in 1925 represented reductions when fully operative of the following percentages of the pay rolls : Per cent.Navy .....................15Army        ...       ...       ...       ......       ......   20Air Force......................   10Although these percentages differ appreciably, the reductions in the Navy and Army were considered to be of equivalent effect, regard being had to the different balance of rank and service in the two arms.98. The effect of the reduction in pay for newly joined officers (combined with the further fall in the cost of living) can be seen by  continuing  one  of  the tables in  the  Anderson  report  as II   follows : On Appointment.

It appears to us on these figures that if the 1925 rates were fully operative, a substantial reduction since 1923 would by now have been effected, and while we have not pursued our enquiries into such detail as would enable us to say that in all cases we have considered each individual rate, it is clear to us that only minor adjustments would at the most be called for. In these circumstances we do not consider that there is any case at the present time for variation of the 1925 rates.101. This conclusion is reinforced when we bear in mind the fundamental basis of wage settlement set out in the preamble to this chapter. We cannot overlook the fact that recruiting for the Army is far from satisfactory, although many factors enter into the question of recruiting besides that of pay. Unsatisfactory recruiting is not necessarily evidence of inadequate pay, but clearly the position has to be borne in mind and if recruiting is not good, a strong case would have to be made out on other grounds before reduction could be imposed.
102. We turn now to the question of the &quot; vested rights &quot; of those members of the Forces who were serving before October, 1925. We would say at the outset that on the basis that rates of pay should be sufficient to recruit and retain an efficient service, we can see no logical justification for treating existing personnel better than new entrants. The rate at which the new entrant is re-recruited is one of the measures by which the conformity of rates to outside standards is to be judged. Logic is not, however, the only factor, and in particular the rates of pay of the earlier en-entrants have to be considered in the light of a number of statements which have been made to the personnel concerned. These we pro-pose now to examine.103. No officer or man serving His Majesty has any legal claim to particular rates of pay, so that as a matter of law, the rates of pay of the Services can be changed at any time and the changes can be applied to everyone in the service. On the other hand, although this is strictly the legal position, yet a moral claim to the retention of rates of pay may foe created if statements have been made or action taken which afford reasonable ground for the expectation that the rates will not be changed; and this claim is much stronger if the statements made or action taken were such as would have created a contractual obligation had it not been for the privileged position which the Crown occupies in relation to its servants.104. The above general principle applies to all servants of the Crown. Its application to the Fighting Services presents special problems. In the case of the rank and file, enlistment is for defi-nite periods of service and the sailor, soldier or airman is not free to withdraw his services until those periods are complete. The right of the State to alter the pay of State servants is, we presume, a particular application of the right to dismiss at will the employee is in effect dismissed and re-engaged, and he is free to refuse re-engagement if the revised terms are not acceptable to him. Clearly then special considerations arise in the alteration of the pay of a man who is not free to withdraw his services.105. When the revised rates were introduced in 1925, definite statements were made to the men that the new rates would not be applied to men then in the service. The decision to this effect was communicated in the case of the Admiralty by a Fleet Order in the following terms &quot; Men who enter the Royal Navy or Royal Marines after 4th October, 1925, will receive the rates of substantive pay shown in the schedule to this Fleet Order, in lieu of the existing rates.&quot; It has been decided on the present occasion that men serving on 4th October, 1925, shall continue to be paid according
to existing scales, and the application of this decision is de-fined in detail in the following paragraphs. It must, however, be clearly understood that men are not entitled to claim a right to any rate of pay or other emolument under existing scales in the event of reduced scales being introduced &quot;.Similar orders were issued in the Army and Air Force.106. It appears to us clear from these orders that although men serving before October, 1925, were promised the retention of exist-ing scales, it was made clear to them that they had no claim as of right to such scales if reduced scales were introduced.107. The question of introduction of the new rates can be cp -sidered under two heads, viz., introduction on extensions of service or re-enlistment, and introduction forthwith in all cases. To the former of these two heads we can see no objection. We under-stand in fact that the War Office were prepared in 1925 (if the other Services followed a like course) to make the new rates applicable on extensions of service or re-enlistment, but that the Admiralty objected to this course. It appears to us that the position taken up by the Admiralty in 1925 is impossible to defend. It means that once a man has been enlisted the rates of pay in force at the time of his enlistment must apply throughout the whole period during which he may serve on successive engagements. This principle applies not only to the actual rate of the bottom rank in which he enlisted, but to the rates of all higher ranks&apos; to which he may. be promoted. We believe it is admitted that a man has no right of promotion, that in fact his prospects of promotion might be considerably worsened by re-organisation of establishment or in other ways without giving him any claim to compensation. Yet, although a man&apos;s prospects might be vitally altered by changes in the service, one particular condition of service, viz., rates of pay is held to be unalterable. We can see no justification for this artificial view and we think that if other conditions can be thus altered at will during a period of engagement, the rate of pay should be alterable if necessary actually on re-engagement.10S. We think, therefore, that the least change which should now be made is that the new rates should be applied to the pre-1925 personnel as and when they enter upon a new engagement.109. In present circumstances, we think that more than this is called for. The financial circumstances of to-day are very different from those of 1925 n and if the decisions of 1925 had to be taken now, we think that they would undoubtedly be in different terms. On equitable grounds, wTe consider that the right expressly reserved in 1925 to alter pay ought now to be exercised and that the men on the 1919 rates should be brought at an early date on to the 1925 rates, but it is necessary to bear in mind the difference we have
already described between the position of the enlisted man and the civilian employee of the State. It has been suggested to us that if the rate of pay of an enlisted man is altered during the period of his engagement, it would be necessary to give him the opportunity of discharge if he is unwilling to accept the new rates.110. What the effect of the grant of the opportunity for dis-charge would have on the personnel we are not competent to gauge. On the one hand we have the anomaly of two men doing the same work under the same conditions drawing different rates of pay a practice which would be impossible in industry. On the other hand, we have a large body of men who may well believe that the intention in 1925 was to continue their existing rates of pay throughout their period of then enlisted service and who have re-engaged in this belief.111. Despite the difficulties above enumerated, we recommend that the whole position should be reviewed, as we feel that all ranks should be put on the 1925 rates of pay.112. The position of officers is not broadly different from that of the men. Similarly, in their! case, we think the 1925 rates should be applied to all officers.113. In the case of officers, a further alteration appears to us to be called for. The standard rates, both 1919 and 1925, include provision for variation with the cost of living. The original rates were applicable for five years and thereafter review has been triennial, except that a concession was made for one year from 1st July, 1930, in view of a similar concession made in the Civil Service. The relative infrequency of review means that the rates do not keep close touch with the cost of living. While the cost of living was high, especially in 1920 and 1921, the pay of officers lagged behind the actual figure of increase. While the cost of living has been falling, the rates have been higher than current figures warranted. The rate payable from 1st July, 1931, to 30th June, 1933, will be based on a figure of 65 per cent, above pre-war. If the current cost of living figure of 45&quot; per cent, above pre-war remains unaltered, it will not reflect itself in remunera-tion in the Fighting Services until 1st July, 1933.114. We think it not inequitable that as from a date as soon as possible after 1st July, 1931, the rate of deduction should be based on average cost of living over a period of six months before that date, and that it should thereafter be subject to more frequent review.The effect of this would be a reduction of 11 per cent, off standard rates instead of the 8 per cent, now ordered.
115. The financial effect of the pay of the Fighting Services being placed on a uniform basis and the introduction of 1925 rates forthwith is as follows : Saving in a full year.  Navy: Officers   ............... 87,000Men       ............... 1,030,000Army : Officers...........- 140,000Men       ............... 850,000Air Force : Officers      ............ 19,000Men         ............ 73,000Total ...  2,199,000The saving from the introduction of revised cost of living deduction is :  Navy: Officers      ...      ............   180,000Army : Officers      ......       .........   175,000Air Force: Officers        ............    45,000Total  ...  400,0004. POLICE.116. The approximate cost of police pay in 1931 in England and Wales is  14,000,000, and in Scotland is  1,000,000. The Exchequer pays one-half of these sums, viz.,  7,800,000.117. Before the war, the rates of pay of the police varied very considerably in the different forces. The rate in London was 30s. to 42s., in Dorset 22s. 5d. to 30s. 3d. a week (plus in each case rent aid).118. In 1919, on the recommendations of the Desborough Committee, uniform scales for Great Britain were established of 70s. rising to 95s. a week for Constables and 100s. rising to 112s. 6d. a week for Sergeants. In addition, in each case, free quarters or an allowance in lieu, free uniform and boots or a boot allowance were provided.These scales contained no element variable with the cost of living. The last cost of living figure available when the Desborough Com-mittee reported was 105 per cent, above pre-war. A clue to the cost of living figure which the Committee had in mind is given by paragraph 36 of their First Eeport, which reads &quot; Taking all things into consideration we think that it would be fair to suppose that
585the policeman&apos;s receipts would have to be about double what they were in 1914 to compensate for the increase of prices.&quot;119. In 1920, when the cost of living rose rapidly, the police pressed for a bonus and following investigation by another Committee a bonus was granted in respect of the increase of cost of living above a figure of 130 above pre-war in the Metropolitan area and certain other large towns, 140 above pre-war in intermediate areas, and 150 above pre-war in rural areas.This bonus ceased when the cost of living fell again below the above figures.120. The Geddes Committee recommended that the obligation to pay the Metropolitan scale in county and borough police forces should be cancelled, and that certain allowances should be reviewed. These recommendations were not adopted, but instead, an all-round deduction of 2J- per cent, was made from pay (in addition to the 2J per cent, rateable deduction towards pension which had been made for many years), and rent allowances were reduced or a charge made if accommodation was provided.121. As early as 1923, the question of alteration of police rates was raised, and in that year the Desborough Committee was recon-stituted to advise what readjustments should be made in the stand-ard conditions of service of the Police Forces having regard, inter alia, to the economic conditions since the first Desborough Reports were made, and in particular to report upon the scale of pay to be given to new entrants to the police forces.The Committee reported in March 1924 that &quot; inasmuch as it must be unsettling to any service to have repeated revisions of their rates of pay, we are of opinion that it is not an opportune moment for disturbing an arrangement come to so recently.&quot;122. The rates of pay of new entrants were next considered by a Sub-Committee of the Police Council who failed to reach agreement.123. In 1925, following consideration by a Committee under Lord Lee, the deductions from rent allowances and the supple-mentary deduction of 2J- per cent, from pay were discontinued, but the normal rateable deduction towards pension was increased from 2^ per cent, to 5 per cent.124. Police pay was next considered in 1927 by a Committee under Lord Chalmers. The terms of reference of this Committee were restricted, so far as pay was concerned, to the pay of new entrants. They recommended that a scale of pay should be pre-scribed commencing at 55s. a week for Constables and rising by .2s. biennially to 75s. a week with two further increments of 2s. 6d.
each after 21 and 25 years service respectively. For Sergeants, they recommended a scale of 85s. rising by 2s. 6d. annually to 97s. 6d. a week.These recommendations were not accepted by the Government of the day, and the pay of police remains at the level fixed in 1919, subject, however, to the additional rateable deduction towards pension of 2  per cent, made in 1925 in place of the temporary deduction of 21 per cent, from pay which was imposed in 1922.125. The cost of living when the Chalmers Committee considered police pay in 1927 averaged about 65 per cent, above pre-war. In the light of conditions then prevailing and after detailed comparison of rates of wages paid in industry that Committee thought a reduc-tion of 15s. a week from the minimum pay of a Constable, rising owing to the slower increments to 25s. a week after 10 years&apos; service, and falling again to 15s. a week at the maximum, and a reduction of 15s. a week from the pay of a Sergeant were justified. These reductions were 21J per cent, at the minimum, 27J per cent, after 10 years&apos; service, and nearly 16 per cent, at the maximum in the case of Constables, and 15 per cent, at the minimum and 13 per cent, at the maximum in the case of Sergeants.- Inasmuch as the police receive allowances in addition to pay, the reductions pro-posed would be somewhat less than the above figures when ex-pressed as percentages not of pay alone but of total remuneration.126. Since those recommendations were made, the cost of living has fallen from 65 to 45 per cent, above pre-war. Wages in outside industry have also fallen.127. If theDesboroughCommittee&apos;s view that the scales they pro-posed had to be twice pre-war, in the circumstances which existed in 1919, to compensate for the increased cost of living is taken as a basis for consideration, then inasmuch as the present cost of living is half as much again as pre-war, a reduction of 25 per cent, would be justified.128. As the police receive allowances in addition to pay, the relative prices of food are perhaps a more appropriate guide than the total cost of living figure, and on this basis alone a still greater reduction would be justified as the cost of food on the 1st May 1931 was only 29 per cent, above pre-war, compared with a figure of 104 per cent, in June 1919.129. We have found some difficulty in determining the reduction to be recommended. On the one hand, it is clear that a substantial reduction is due as a measure of equity to taxpayers, ratepayers and wage earners. On the other hand, we appreciate fully that the task of the police becomes increasingly difficult in many ways in modern conditions and that the police fill an increasingly important role in our social organisation.   Comparisons with pre-war are not
588particularly relevant. Comparison with 1919 can only be made subject to important reservations.130. In considering what our recommendations should be we have had to bear in mind that the present scales are uniform all over the country. We have noted, however, that the payment of rent allow-ances introduces an appreciable element of differentiation in the total remuneration. We have considered carefully the substantial reasons which have been urged in support of the present arrange-ment, and having regard to the strongly expressed views of the Home Office and Scottish Office, we do not recommend disturbing the existing uniformity of scales.131. After balancing all these factors, we recommend that a reduction of 121 Per cent, should be made from the pensionable salaries of all Constables and Sergeants. We think that in fair-ness to the men and to mitigate the effects of a sudden substantial drop in pay, the reduction should be made in two equal instal-ments, one as soon as possible and the other a year later.We have not considered the rates of pay of ranks higher than Sergeant, which vary under the different authorities. We recom-mend that the Home Office and Scottish Office should consider the pay of the higher ranks in the light of our recommendations as regards Constables and Sergeants with a view to comparable re-reductions being made.132. We note that in their Eeport the Desborough Committee considered that the Secretary of State and the Secretary of State for Scotland should have power jointly to fix the standard scale of pensionable pay for Sergeants and Constables and that the standard should be reviewed from time to time. We have regarded the reduction we have proposed as necessary to adjust the present scales to present conditions. We recommend that the scales as now reduced should be reviewed from time to time in the manner contemplated by the Desborough Committee in the light of any change of conditions there may be in the future.133. If our recommendation is adopted, the remuneration per week of the police will be as follows (in addition to the value of pension rights) :-Existing pay lessl2i %.Boot Allowance.Allowance.RentConstable Minimum MaximumSergeant Minimum Maximum61/3 83/li87/6 98/51/-1/-1/-1/-Variable; the high-est rates being 18/-^ and 15/6 for married sergeants and con-stables  respectivelyin London.The revised pay would as before be subject to a deduction of 5 per cent, towards cost of pension.
In addition, uniform is provided, and, in some cases, plain clothes allowance of 5s. a week for Sergeants and Constables, and detec-tive allowances of 10s. a week for Sergeants and 7s. 6d. for Constables are also paid.5. TEACHERS.134. The estimated cost of teachers&apos; pay in 1931 in England and Wales is  42,900,000 for elementary teachers (towards which the State pays in general 60 per cent, or  25,740,000), and  11,250,000 for secondary and technical teachers (towards which the State nays 50 per cent, or  5,625,000). The total State contribution in England and Wales is thus  31,365,000. In Scotland, the State pays into the Education (Scotland) Fund ll/80ths of this contribution, or  4,313,000. The total State grant payable in Great Britain as regards teachers&apos; remuneration is thus  35,678,000.135. As in ithe case of police, the salaries of teachers before the war varied widely in the different areas. After the war, then-salaries were considered by the Burnham Committee with a view to securing &quot; an orderly and progressive solution of the salary problem in Public Elementary Schools by agreement, on a national basis, and its correlation with a solution of the salary problem in Secondary Schools.&quot;136. The Burnham Committee issued a series of reports, first es-tablishing a Provisional Minimum scale, then recommending Standard Scales for elementary teachers and dealing with the distribution of these scales over the various Education Authorities, and later recommending scales for Secondary and Technical Schools.137. The Provisional Minimum scale, recommended when the cost of living was about 125 per cent, above pre-war, on a rough average approximately doubled the pre-war pay of assistant teachers and more than doubled that of head teachers. When the later recommendations were made, the cost of living had risen appreciably further, being about 164 per cent, above pre-war, and. the standard scales meant extra remuneration to elementary teachers of 159 per cent, above the pre-war average (i.e., they were roughly times pre-war). Provision was made that if the cost of living rose above 170 per cent, above pre-war, a bonus should be granted but no provision was made for a reduction if the cost of living fell.138. The scales thus fixed were to hold good for the four years, 1st April, 1921, to 31st March, 1925. Their full effect was not however, felt at once as the increase necessary to bring each teacher to his right position in the new scales was given in three equal annual instalments, i.e., the full scheme would not have been in operation until the year beginning 1st April, 1923.
139. In the autumn of 1921, the Geddes Committee considered education expenditure. By this time, the cost of living had fallen appreciabty and the Committee commented on the fact that1 while reductions on the ground of the falling cost of living had been applied to most classes of the community and the process was continuing, the striking fact about teachers&apos; salaries was that their increases had suffered no check with the large fall in the cost of living and were still automatically increasing.The G-eddes Committee clearly contemplated substantial cuts in elementary, secondary and technical teachers&apos; salaries.140. No action was, however, taken at the time on the Com-mittee&apos;s implied recommendation that the teachers must in the national interest face the prospect of substantial modifications in their rates of pay. The view was apparently held that alteration at that moment would involve a breach of faith.141. In 1922, however, with a further fall in the cost of living, it became obvious .that the full Burnham rates were no longer justified, and the teachers decided on 29th December, 1922, to accept a reduction of salaries of 5 per cent, from 1st April, 1923. This reduction was continued by consent for the year 1924-25.142. At this point, reference must be made to teachers&apos; pensions. Before the war, the scale of pensions was inadequate, and towards these inadequate pensions the teachers contributed  3 12s. Od. a year (men) and  2 8s. Od. a year (women). In 1918, the con-tributions were abolished and the scheme of pensions was improved, being approximated to the Civil Service scheme. The pensions were paid entirely by the State. The Geddes Committee criticised a scheme under which the local authority had control of the pay, age of retirement and promotion of the staff, but no financial interest in the pensions cost. They recommended that a 5 per cent, levy should be paid by teachers towards their pensions, and this recommendation received legislative sanction from the 1st June, 1922. In considering the pension deduction then imposed in its relevance to salary comparisons, it should be borne in mind that the scheme of 1918, even with the contribu-tions imposed in 1922, is more favourable to the teachers than their pre-war contributory scheme.143. The Burnham scales were due for review in 1925. In 1923, negotiations were commenced and the local authorities demanded reductions of 15 per cent., then 12 per cent., then 10 per cent, as an all-round reduction before considering details. These negotia-tions, however, broke down, and the determination of the review to be made was referred to Lord Burnham as arbitrator. The awards then made effected a reduction on a salary bill of some  50,000,000 of a net sum of less than  500,000 or under 1 per cent.

Od. per annum (women).There were no pension contributions in 1920 or 1921. As from 1st June, 1922, the salaries of pensionable teachers (this includes all the classes in this table except the supplementary teachers) were subject to a pension contribution of 5 per cent. The figures in these tables show the salaries before deduction of any pension contributions.o 3
145. The difference between the figures in the last table and the figures for 31st March, 1930, thus shows the effect of the 5 per cent, reduction in 1923-25 and the further alterations made on review from 1st April, 1925, viz. a total reduction on the average salary of all teachers compared with the full Burnham scales of 6.1 per cent.146. The scales fixed in 1925 were subject to review after 31st March, 1931, on one year&apos;s notice. Notice has now been given to terminate them as from 31st March, 1932, and we understand that consideration is now being given to revised scales.147. Before examining the scales in more detail, we turn to the method of review. Teachers are engaged and paid by the local authorities and the settlement of their salary scales is regarded as a matter for negotiation between representatives of the teachers and local authorities. The interest of the State arises through the payment of percentage grants. In theory the State is not com-mitted to payment of grant on the full scales and it need only recognise for grant purposes such scales as it thinks reasonable. Various reasons have been urged in defence of this position. But whatever its theoretical justification may be, it appears to us from a practical point of view to be indefensible. The State is clearly in a very difficult position if it attempts to pay grant on scales lower than those to which representatives of the local authorities and the teachers have agreed, or which have been determined by an Arbitrator. In practice, the position must work out that local authorities and teachers determine the salaries and the State has to pay 60 per cent., or in some cases more (in the case of elementary teachers), of the bill.148. The least reform which appears to us to be essential is that the State should be a party to the negotiations and should place before the negotiators the important national financial considerations which arise on the settlement of a matter involving so heavy a charge on the taxpayer. But in present circumstances, more than this appears to us to be necessary. In the present financial situa-tion, it appears to us essential that the Government must itself announce to the negotiating body that grants will only be paid on the assumption that there is an overall cut in the total cost of a prescribed percentage.149. In this connection we might point to the position of the police. Like teachers, they are engaged, paid, promoted and retired by local authorities. Unlike teachers, their pensions are paid by local authorities, aided by a percentage grant from the State. Yet in their cases the State fixes the salaries. We do not see any funda-mental reason why if the fixing of salaries by the State is appro-priate in the case of the police it should be inappropriate in the case of the teachers.
150. It is clear from the circumstances under which the Burn-ham Committee originally considered its recommendations, and in particular from their proposal that a bonus should be paid if the cost of living rose above a figure of 170 per cent, above pre-war that their scales were framed in the light of a cost of living very near the post-war peak. The fall in cost of living from 170 per cent, above pre-war down to the present level of 45 per cent, above pre-war is a fall of &apos;just over 46 per cent. If the salaries of teachers had been adjusted in accordance with the Civil Service cost of living scheme, a peak figure of  355 a year (the full Bum-ham average of certificated men teachers) would on the present Civil Service figure of 55 per cent, above pre-war now have fallen to  221 a year, a fall of 38 per cent., and as much as 34 per cent, below the present average salary of certificated men teachers ( 334). For certificated women teachers, the peak figure of  280 a year would similarly have fallen to  168 a year, a fail of 40 per cent., and 34 per cent, below the present average ( 254).151. As was pointed out by the Geddes Committee, the majority of the profession have acquired their qualifications largely at the expense of the public at an average cost to the State of  70 a year for either two or four years.152. The remuneration of secondary teachers has followed lines closely comparable with those of elementary teachers. A table on similar lines to that given for elementary teachers earlier in our report is appended : 	Graduates.			Non-Graduates.			Men.	Women.	Men and Women.	Men.	Women.

58153. It is clear from this table that the pay of graduates has followed very closely that of elementary teachers. The pay of non-graduates appears from the average figures to have been re-duced more than that of the other classes, but we understand that this is due to changes in classification having been made between 1924 and 1930, and not to the scales having been modified to a degree different from the others.154. In the case of technical teachers, there is a wider variety of qualification included in the group than in the case of elementary teachers and secondary teachers. The bulk of the technical teachers are paid on the secondary teacher scales, but a number of special posts exists.155. The indications we have given of the effect of change in the cost of living on teachers&apos; salaries all point to a reduction in the neighbourhood of 30 per cent. Having regard to the practical difficulty of enforcing so large a reduction even though it may be justified, and to the gradual adjustment to a higher standard of liv-ing which must necessa2-ily have followed the increasing purchasing power of their salaries, we cannot recommend so high a reduction. We feel, however, after balancing the relative claims of the teacher and the taxpayer and ratepayer that 20 per cent, is the minimum reduction which should be made. We would point out that on the average as regards elementary teachers, this cut will still leave them with more than double their pre-war remuneration.We recommend that provision should be made within the exist-ing arrangements for the salaries as reduced to be reviewed from time to time in the light of any change of conditions there may be in the future.pensions.156. The total pensions payable in 1931 to the classes covered by this part of our report are estimated to amount to :   Civil Seiwants (including llevenue Depart-ments, Post Office, and civil pensions in the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry)     8,000,000Fighting Services        ............   16,500,000Police     ..................     5,600,000Teachers..................     6,500,000Total     ............ 36,600,000We would emphasise that this sum of  36,600,000 includes only payments to retired servants of the State and local authorities, and not such pensions as Old Age and Widows&apos; Pensions or War Pensions.
There are, however, included lump sum awards on retirement, gratuities on death, marriage gratuities, injury grants and a number of similar miscellaneous items.In addition to the above sums there are pensions and allow-ances payable to former members of the Eoyal Irish Constabulary amounting to  1,812,563 gross.157. The Exchequer does not bear the whole of this cost.(a) In respect of Civil Servants and ithe Hoyal Irish Constabulary recoveries are effected amounting to  1,795,306 of which the largest items are :  Irish Eree State...............   1,309,722Northern Ireland...............      372,525Savings Banks Funds............     101,680(6) In the case of police, a rateable deduction of 5 per cent, is made from pay towards ithe cost of pension and the Exchequer pays 50 per cent, of the net cost.(c) In the case of teachers, contributions by the teachers and their employers of 5 per cent, of salary in each case are received.The amount so recovered after allowing for the State grant payable in respect of the employers&apos; contribution is : England and Wales     ............   3,803,200Scotland.........      .........      535,602Allowing for these contributions and recoveries, the net cost to the taxpayer of all the pensions here considered is about  29,700,000, and this charge is steadily increasing.158. The question of pensions falls under two broad heads : (a) Pensions of those who have already retired;(b) Pensions which will ultimately accrue to those now serving or to new entrants to the services.1. existing pensioners.159. It is only in the case of existing pensions that there is any possibility of immediate economy. We recognise that the field contains widely differing types of cases ranging from some pre-war pensions which have not been increased, through many inter-mediate itypes, to post-war pensions based on salaries at their peak which have not been reduced. If adjustments are to be made to bring pensions which reflect a cost of living higher than to-day into line with those which would be awarded under present conditions (including the effect of reductions in pay which we have recommended), a wide variety of cuts would be necessary to secure
even approximate fairness over the field and the whole question would require examination in considerable detail.160. We have considered the arguments for and against altera-tion of pensions.   On the one hand, if existing pensions are not touched, there will be appreciable anomalies between men who retire immediately before the reductions in salary which we recom-rnend take effect, and those who retire directly after such reduc-tions have been effected with pensions based on ithe lower salary rate.   Further, the increased purchasing power of the pound ster-ling in recent years has increased the real value of pensions as it has improved the true worth of salaries and if this were the only consideration the case for reduction of those post-war pen-sions which have not varied with cost of living would be indis-putable.   On the other hand, pensions are in a different category from salaries.   It may be argued that in the case of men who have actually retired, the amount of pensions payable must be regarded as definitely determined irrespective of the actual money worth.   The legal position varies between the different groups. No legal rights attach to some pensions while others could only be altered by legislation.   It is represented to us that apart from any difference in the legal position a pension now in course of payment represents the fulfilment by the State  (or the local authority) of the terms on which the employee gave his services and that any alteration of existing pensions would be a breach of what is morally a contractual relationship.161. After careful consideration of the matter in all its impli-cations, we reach the conclusion that existing pensions can only be altered if a general measure of all-round sacrifice is imposed. We defer dealing with this possibility until the conclusion of our report. We recognise that this course will lead to the anomalies we have mentioned, but wei think those anomalies must be faced.162. We do not think that this general conclusion precludes an adjustment of the pensions of officers of the Fighting Services on the same lines as our proposals in pay, to bring the variable part of pensions into earlier touch with cost of living changes.163. If any alteration of pensions is necessary we think that before any overall deduction is made, the following adjust-ments of existing pensions to secure relative equality between the different classes should first be effected. In the case of the Civil Service, pensions awarded between the 1st March, 1920 (when the present cost of living bonus scheme began) and March, 1922, should be made subject to variation in the same way as pensions awarded after March, 1922, which contain a variable supplement. In the case of the Fighting Services, the new 1930 rates for men should be applied to existing pensioners. In the case of the Police, pensions based on Desborough pay should be reduced by the per-centage by which we recommend that pay should now be reduced.
2. FUTURE PENSIONS.164. We now refer to the question of the pensions which will ultimately accrue to those now serving and to new entrants. Any economies recommended in this direction will only become effective as the employees retire and there will be no immediate relief to the taxpayer. At the same time we consider that there are various important points which require consideration.165. In the case of all classes, except the Fighting Services, pen-sions are based on pay, and where we have recommended alterations of pay, alteration of pensions will automatically follow, either at once, where pensions are based on actual pay, or after a short period of years, where pensions are based on average pay. In the cases of the Civil Service and officers of the Fighting Services, a portion of the pension varies as the cost of living changes.Civil Service Marriage Gratuities.166. We can find no sufficient justification for the award of gratuitous-ties to established women employees on marriage. These gratuities, amounting at the maximum to one year&apos;s pay in each case, are not awarded under statute. Their total cost is about  167,000 a year. We are not aware that gratuities are generally granted in outside employment, and we think that the practice should be discontinued. Without these special gratuities, the pension rights of women em-ployees will still be analogous to those of men.Police.167. Owing possibly to the nature of the duties and the limited number of posts suitable for older men, police are allowed to retire on pension after 25 years of sendee. This service is often com-pleted at 45 years of age or soon after. A member of the police force can thus retire voluntarily at an age when he will normally expect to undertake further employment, indeed the police officer will, by reason of his previous experience and of the high respect in which the police are held, be in a favourable position for obtain ing it. Police who entered the service before 1919 in England and Wales are in the majority of forces qualified for their full pension of two thirds of pay after 26 years of service. Scottish police, owing to a difference of their pre-1919 pension terms, are not qualified for full pension until 30 years of service is reached. Therefore, as regards men in England and Wales who are now retiring voluntarily on pension, the full pension may be reached while a man is still at a relatively early age.

168. It should be appreciated that the present system involves a quite disproportionate non-effective charge, and the pension bill is rapidly rising. Expressed as an annual addition to salary payable throughout the service of each office i&apos;, the pension rights are worth rather more than jG50 a year (from which the rateable deduction of 5 per cent, of pay has to be subtracted) in the case of police in England and Wales who entered the service before 1919. It is estimated by the Government Actuary that for every 100 men on the active list, there will, when stability is reached, be over 60 men on pension, with a pension charge after deducting contributions by the men of 46 per cent, of the salary bill. We think this a serious situation calling for immediate action with a view to the reduction of the accruing pension liability. We recommend that the right of voluntary retirement after 25 years of service should be with-drawn from the existing personnel and that retirement should not be permitted before the age of 50 is reached. In view, however, of expectations which have doubtless been formed, we think it would be necessary to allow a period of notice (which we suggest might be five years), before this change becomes operative.169. We recommend that the whole subject of police pensions should be reviewed at&apos; a very early date, with a view to determining conditions of service for new entrants which will effect a further saving in the present high non-effective cost.Fighting Services.170. We have already referred to the fact that pensions in the Fighting Services are not based on pay. Consequently the reduction in pay which we recommend will not be automatically reflected in pension. In the case of officers only 20 per cent, of the pension varies with the cost of living. In the case of men&apos;s pensions, there is no provision for variation with the cost of living, and the increased pension rates fixed in 1919 are being drawn in full by all men discharged on pension since the war, and by former pensioners who rejoined for service in the war. As from the 1st April, 1930, a lower scale of pension has been introduced, representing an average reduction of about 18 per cent, in the 1919 scale, but this scale only affects men entered from that date. On the present basis, awards on the 1919 scale will continue to be made for 20 years or more, and it will be a very long time before any appreciable saving results from the new scale.171. According to the traditional practice of the services a new pension scale is not applied to the detriment of a man during his ser-vice. In the terms of the Army Pay Warrant &quot; A soldier entitled to pension, for the payment of which money may be voted by Parlia-ment, may have the benefit of any Warrant or regulation in force at the date of his enlistment.&quot;     This provision seems to us to
go beyond what is necessary and in the circumstances of to-day to be indefensible. In our view the appropriate time to declare a man&apos;s entitlement to pension is when he enters upon his final term of service qualifying him for pension in due course. Ee is then free to serve or withdraw, and the State is free to accept or reject his further services. We think that a condition of acceptance for further service should be the application of the pension scales current at the time.172. We recommend therefore that the 1930 scales of pension should be applied, on re-engagement or extension, to all men now serving. For men already serving their final term of engagement different considerations arise which require to be considered in the light of the action which may be taken on our suggestions on pay, but we think a satisfactory scheme could be framed on the basis that a man whether enlisted before or after 1925 should, as from the date of introduction of 1925 rates universally, begin to earn pension in respect of his future service on the new 1930 rates. Having regard to the different conditions on which pensions in the Fighting Services are based, this appears to us to be tho greatest extent to which action can be taken in the case of the Services in harmony with what will happen automatically in the other cases we have under review.173. In the case of officers, in view of the system of cost of living-adjustment it was apparently, considered unnecessary to lay down new scales of retired pay in 1930 when the men&apos;s pensions were revised. We have already recommended an acceleration of tho cost of living adjustment on pay and existing pensions and a similar adjustment should be made on future pensions.174. Apart from this change, we think that the pension-scheme for officers in the three Services calls for reconsideration.All three Services are faced with the same problem. The essen-tial requirement of a combatant service is a high proportion of fairly young officers. Consequently, many more officers have to be recruited ito the services than can hope to find life careers therein. The three services tackle this fundamental problem in different ways, and with widely different results as regards non-effective cost. In the Air Force, there is a large element of short service recruitment. Speaking broadly, only such number of officers are engaged on permanent commissions as can hope to find careers in the service, allowing a margin for selection in the filling of higher posts. In the Navy and Army, on the other hand, officers are normally engaged on pensionable tenure and reliance is placed on limitation of promotion, followed by the compulsory retirement at early ages of those who are passed over, in order to weed out those whom it is not desired to retain to fill the higher posts. In the case of the Navy, in the Executive Branch the prospect open to nearly two-thirds of the officers is
retirement as Lieut.-Commander, at or before 45; of the remain-ing one-third a large proportion retire before 50, as Commanders or as Eear-Admirals retired immediately on promotion.175. The award of life pensions at early ages is expensive. Where early retirement ensues, the basis of pension naturally tends to be not only a reward for past service but compensation for premature-ture retirement. Thus the pension cost, in terms of the annual equivalent during service, becomes out of all proportion to the effective cost in pay, etc.176. In the case of the Navy, we find that in 1930 in the Execu-tive Branch there were 78 retirements on retired pay, of which 36 were retirements of Commanders at an average age of 46. The average retired pay of the 36 Commanders at standard rates was  581 a year.177. The very high cost of these premature retirements should be realised. In the case of these Commanders, the capital sum equivalent at retirement to the standard retired pay is  8,950 per officer, and the annual addition to salary during service which would have been necessary to produce this capital sum on retire-ment is  195 a year. This calculation is based on standard pay and the actual rates differ from standard pay by the amount of the cost of living deductions. But if an average cost of living reduction of 12J per cent, over the whole period during which pension will be drawn is assumed, the capital value of the pen-eion is nearly  8,000, equivalent to an annual addition to pay during service of about  170 a year.178. The financial effect of early retirement in ranks higher than Commander is still more striking. Taking again the actual retire-ments in 1930, the average age at retirement of Captains and those Bear-Admirals who had spent one day only in &apos; that rank is 49. The capital value of the pension and the annual equivalent addition to pay throughout service (again making a deduction of 12J per cent, to allow for cost of living deductions) were  11,100 and  197 a year respectively for each officer.179. We feel that these facts merit serious consideration, although it is beyond the practical scope of our Enquiry to make concrete suggestions for reform. Any pensions scheme must necessarily coincide with the requirements of a service, but if the cost is unreasonable the requiremenits should be reconsidered. We &quot;cannot think that Naval requirements inevitably must involve such a rapid passage through the lists as now obtains, and we suggest that it should be possible to provide the necessary number of officers for the Navy on the basis of a longer average career, with a resulting saving not only in non-effective costs but also in the provision for training.
180. When we turn from the Executive Branch to certain other branches (Instructors, Chaplains, Doctors and Accountants) we find even higher values of pensions. Before the war, these branches of the service were retired under conditions differing from those of the Executive Branch. Compulsory retirement was at 55 or 60. The regulations are now the same as for the Executive Branch and provide not only for compulsory retirement at much earlier ages, but also ready facilities for voluntary retirement on retired pay from the age of 40. Where entry to the service is at higher ages the value of the pension correspondingly bears a higher ratio to the pay. In the most extreme case brought to our notice, the three Chaplains who retired in the years 1928-30, at an average age of 49 and with an average of 18 years&apos; service, received pensions which represenF on the average an annual addition to pay of over  260 a year for each year of service, or a capital sum equivalent to  6,900 for each chaplain.181. In the case of the Army, the position is not unlike that of the Navy though the average ages of retirement are somewhat higher and the value of pension somewhat less. The same observa-tions which we have made in the case of the Navy apply to the Army.182. We think that the whole scheme of pensions in the Fighting Services calls for immediate examination in the light of its ex-extremely expensive character. In the particular case of the Non-Executive branches, we recommend as an immediate measure that all age limits for retirement under 60 should be increased by five years pending such enquiry and that voluntary retirement on retired pay should not be permitted to an officer with less than 20 years&apos; service.3. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON PENSIONS.183. We have already referred in the first chapter of our Report to the manner in which liabilities for pension charges are increasing, and we feel that the immediate and prospective position of the National Exchequer is such that the steady increase, super-imposed on the present large total, must be viewed with appre-hension.If our recommendations are adopted, there will, in the course of time, be some slackening in the rate of growth, but the full effect of new pension conditions cannot be felt for many years.184. We feel that it is a matter for serious consideration whether the accepted methods of Government finance are really adequate to deal with services where there is a large&apos; deferred liability. The question is mainly one of degree. Where an employee&apos;s current service carries with it a deferred benefit representing a reasonably small percentage of salary we see no strong objection to the present
method of accounting. But where the value of the deferred benefit rises to a high percentage of the current salary charge, (here is great danger of liabilities being incurred without the tax-payer realising the large extent of his commitments until it is too late substantially to reduce them. In the case of the police, teachers and the Fighting Services there should be constituted a pension fund to which the appropriate percentage of salaries should be paid in order that the expensive character of the pension schemes may be fully appreciated and the full cost of the heavy liabilities involved may be met at the time the liabilities are incurred.CONCLUSION ON PAY AND PENSIONS.185. In conclusion, we would stress two points. First, it has been our object to secure fairness as between the different classes we have considered. It may appear that our recommendations differ between one class and another to an extent which might suggest that we have dealt harshly with some classes. We are satisfied that this is not so, and that widely as our recommendations differ, they do no more than reflect the more favourable treatment that some classes have received since the immediate post-war period. We regard the reductions we have proposed, not as sacrifices necessi--tated by national financial stringency but as readjustments neces-sary to re-establish fair relativities over the field of Government&apos; and local authority servants and with wage earners generally.Secondly, while we feel that our recommendations are re-adjust-ments, the classes concerned will probably not unnaturally regard them as sacrifices called for on their part. The spirit in which those sacrifices are made will depend on the extent to which the Government show by their actions over the whole field of expendi-ture that strict economy is recognised as a national necessity. No one will recognise the need for economy at his expense if he sees unrestricted expenditure continuing in other directions.

chapter iv.defence.186. The total of the Estimates for the Fighting Services in 1931 is :  Navy   ..................      51,605,000Army..................      39,930,000Air Force      ...............      18,100,000Total...... 109,635,000187. There is a deeply rooted belief in many quarters that the Fighting Services offer a large scope for economies, and we think it right to consider this expenditure from a general point of view-before turning to the Services individually. We suspect that criticism of expenditure in other directions has been less readily forthcoming in the past owing to the belief that if only the Government of the day would tackle the expenditure in the Navy, Army and Air Force, large countervailing economies could be obtained. If in future State expenditure is to be adequately con-sidered as a whole, in the light of the ability of the taxpayer to bear the burden, we think it essential that there should be a right understanding of what economies are possible in the Fighting-Services and in what directions and under what conditions those economies must be sought.188. The cost of the Fighting Services depends on three main considerations : (1) size; (2) design; and (3) administration. By &quot; size &quot; we mean the number of fighting units ships; battalions or brigades, etc.; and air squadrons. By &quot; design &quot; we mean the tonnage, speed and armament of the several classes of ships ; the size, organisation and equipment of the several military units in the Army; the speed, equipment and design of the several squadrons of the Royal Air Force. &quot; Administration &quot; requires no special definition. Of these three components it is size and design which have the greatest bearing on cost; the effect of administra-tion on finance is relatively less important. It is obvious at once that &quot; size &quot; and, to a lesser extent, &quot; design &quot; (which together may be described as &quot; strength &quot;) are determined mainly by con-sideration of the commitments which have been undertaken by H.M. Government, either in the interests of national security or as
matters of international obligation, and of the political situation, present and prospective, as it affects those commitments.189. It follows therefore that the most important elements in the cost of Defence are dependent on questions of international policy: We would disclaim at the outset any desire to interfere in these matters, especially as the Government at present has the whole subject under consideration with a view to the Disarmament Con-ference to be held early in 1932. We have, however, had cer-tain confidential information placed at our disposal by the Service Departments, and we are satisfied, from the evidence submitted, that the present strength of H.M. Forces is no more than adequate for requirements under present world conditions.190. It is obvious that, so long as unlimited competition exists between different nations, any interference as a measure of economy with the development of the Services in this country would put us at a disadvantage in relation to other countries.It appears to us therefore that, on the broad issues of size and design no reduction is possible pending a further review of the question of commitments in all its aspects sucli as will be under-taken at the forthcoming Disarmament Conference.191. We would respectfully suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Govem-ment in considering the recommendations to be made on their be-half at the Disarmament Conference should have clearly before them the effect of their proposals on the national finances. We further recommend that each of the Services should be examined immediately after the Conference to determine in the light of the conditions then prevailing the organisation best fitted to carry out the national requirements with the least expense.192. If it is accepted that any fundamental reorganisation of the Services is out of the question pending the further Disarmament Conference, it remains for us to examine what are the possibilities of economy under the head of Administration within the existing organisations.193. It should be appreciated how much of the cost of the Services is determined once the strength is fixed. To illustrate this, we pro-pose to analyse the gross expenditure of the three Services for 1931 on the basis of the Estimates presented to Parliament. This gross expenditure is  122,515,720, which is reduced by receipts from inter-deipartmental payments, Dominion, India and Colonial Contriba-tions, etc., amounting to  12,880,720, to  109,635,000, the net figure we gave at the beginning of this Chapter.

The Admiralty contribution to the Air Ministry in respect of the Fleet Air Arm has been excluded from both expenditure and receipts in the above table as it is merely an interdepartmental payment. The total cost of the Fleet Air Arm of about  3,000,000 a year is distributed over the appropriate items in the table.195. This table indicates in broad outline how continuous has been the reduction in our defence expenditure in the last six
years. Practically all the items show a steady fall, while the total of the gross expenditure has fallen by as much as  16,249,000. It also indicates how much of the present expenditure is directly dependent on the size of the forces; thus personnel and allied services connected with personnel now account for  56,079,000 and the pension charge is  18,632,000-a total of  74,711,000 on these two groups alone, viz. : 61 per cent. Mobile Fighting Material accounts for  19,699,000, Works and Buildings for  1,556,000, General and Technical Stores for  4,129,000, Guns, Projectiles and Ammunition for  3,984,000 and Fuel for i&apos;3,516,000. These items, all of which are necessary to the manning and maintenance of the fighting forces at their present strength, absorb  38,894,000 or 32 per cent. Of the remaining items Head-quarters, Scientific Services, and Miscellaneous represent . 7,085,000, part of which is directly connected with &quot; Strength &quot; and the balance of  710,000 is expenditure on Airships and Civil Aviation borne on the Defence Votes. The table we have given does not pretend to be accurate in all details. It is impossible to make an objective analysis of Defence Expenditure so as to corres-pond exactly with the three subject heads, Size, Design and Administration; each of these elements enters in a greater or less degree into each of the items in the table. But the broad conclusion to be drawn is that fundamental economies are not practicable while the strength of the Forces remains on its present basis. Economies can be made in certain directions, and we make specific recommendations later, but such savings as are possible consist rather of a paring down of necessary services to the minimum consistent with efficiency, than of a fundamental excision of whole items or services. Large scale economies must await further reduction in the strength of the Services, which in turn must depend on general agreement on the policy of international dis-armament.196. In considering such small scale economies as are possible, it must be borne in mind that substantial reductions have been made in recent years in the total of our Defence expenditure as the table on page 62 shows. We shall submit comparative statistics over a series of years when we consider the Departments separately. In addition to the drastic recommenda-tions of the Geddes and Colwyn Committees, constant pressure from the Treasury for reduction in the total expenditure has brought about an acute internal competition for money between the different branches within each service. Year by year, an internal pruning has been going on the effect of which has been to produce an in-creasing economy in all branches. We would take the opportunity at this stage of remarking that we have been impressed by the close attention given in recent years by each of the Services to the purely financial side of their operations, and to the ready co-operation with the Treasury which now exists in efforts to restrict expenditure to the minimum.   We welcome the improvement which appears to us
mmmwmm.to have taken place in recent years in the relations between the Ser-vices and the Treasury. To-day it can no longer be said that the Services consider that it is for the Government to determine policy and that the sole function of the Treasury is to pay&apos; the bill for carrying out that policy.197. The reductions of recent years can be considered in another light in their bearing on our problems. In the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff which after the frank and exhaustive evidence given to us we accept the actual size of our Fighting Forces is now at the minimum consistent with the carrying out of their allotted task and the present standard of size is only practicable because of the high standard of efficiency both of personnel and of material maintained. We have borne this /consideration in mind and realised, in making our recommendations, that if efficiency is appreciably impaired, there would be a considerable danger that some increase in the size of the Forces would be necessary to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities.Before turning to the examination of the Departments individu-ally there are certain matters which are best treated in regard to the services as a whole.(i) Ministry of Defence.198. We have given very careful consideration to this question, because there is undoubtedly a widespread impression in the public mind that large savings might be made in the cost of National Defence by some form of amalgamation of the three Services under a single Minister. It is suggested that such a Minister would not only be able to amalgamate common administrative services, but would also ensure that the whole problem of National Defence was studied from a single standpoint, that economy was secured by the substitution of alternative methods of defence wherever possible, and that where one of the three Forces was being developed in a particular direction, the harmonising of its.growth with the strength of the other two was duly considered.    ^199. We have received valuable evidence on the subject frsISi the Chiefs of Staff and from the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence. We are of course primarily interested in the question from the point of view of its effect on the actualeost of the Fighting Services, but we cannot forget that, in the search for true economy, it is essential to take the wider view and consider the effect of any far-reaching change of system on the efficiency of the service.200. Our conclusion after careful review of all the evidence is that. no substantial reduction of cost would follow from the creation of a Ministry of National Defence, and that on the con-trary there would be a serious risk that the efficiency of the Services might be impaired by the alteration of system involved. We have therefore rejected any idea of economy by this method; and we
hope that our conclusion will be accepted as finally disposing of the suggestion that millions of money could be saved by the formation of a Ministry of Defence.201. In reaching this conclusion, we do not mean to imply that there is no further room for economies by means of greater co-ordination between the three Services; but we see no reason why such economies should not be achieved under the present system r in so far as it is possible to do so without loss of efficiency. Such-economies will fall under two heads, Policy and Administration. (1) As regards the former, we are satisfied that the existing system of co-ordination through the Committee of Imperial Defence, meeting under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister the only Minister whose authority is sufficient to ensure an agreed decision on the occasions when the Services differ on questions of high policy provides, in effect, all the advantages of a single Minister of Defence, without the disadvantages of entrusting supreme control to. a single individual, responsible for and yet divorced from each of the three Services. We have been furnished with convincing evidence to show that the Committee of Imperial Defence does in fact seek to combine economy with efficiency in its recommendations; and we are confident that, in the present financial stringency, increasing attention will be given to this aspect of all problems of National Defence. (2) As regards Ad-rcinistration the scope for economy is, as we have already indicated, relatively small. There are, however, certain services common to the three Departments, such as Medical, Dental, Education, Chaplains, etc. The position of these Services was con-sidered in 1924 by the Mond-Weir Committee, who reported emphatically against amalgamation, and recommended that machinery should be set up, in the form of Joint Inter-departmental Committees, to secure as large a measure of co-ordination as might be found practicable. As a result of the formation of these Com-mittees considerable improvement has taken place, and certain economies have been effected; but we aie not convincd that the process has been carried as far as it might be. It is possible in respect to these particular matters, that, if a single Ministerial authority had been responsible for the administration of all three Services, further action might have been taken, but we have al-ready rejected that solution, on broader grounds of policy. The Committee of Imperial Defence are not concerned with the details of administrative control. The prospects for economy in this direction must therefore depend on a more determined effort at co-ordination by the Departments them-selves; and this in turn must be generated by the constantly in-creasing application of financial pressure, which will oblige the Departments in their own interest to seek economies under the head of administrative charges rather than by sacrificing services more immediately directed to warlike efficiency.moor, c
202. The Colwyn Committee in 1925 made a brief reference to &quot; the possibility of a new general scheme of distribution of the burdens of Imperial Defence between the taxpayers of this country and those of India, the Dominions and the Colonies.&quot;203. Much has been done since that date, through the medium of successive Imperial Conferences and otherwise, to co-ordinate responsibility for Empire defence, e.g., in the development of the naval forces of the Dominions, and in the financial contributions made by New Zealand, the Federated Malay States, Hong Kong and the Straits Settle-ments towards the cost ol the Singapore Base; while in the London Naval Treaty there emerges the idea of aggregating the naval forces of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations for the purpose of limitation by an international agree-ment. But, while in these and other ways a certain re-distribu-tion of the burden has already taken place, to the undoubted relief of the finances of this country, it nevertheless appears to us that even now the share of the British taxpayer in the responsibility for the Defence of the Empire as a whole is disproportionately large. The question is one of undoubted difficulty, raising issues of great constitutional as well as financial importance; and we make no attempt now to discuss the subject in detail, especially as this is clearly not a favourable moment for taking any practical steps. It is indeed common knowledge that certain of the Dominions, so far from being in a position to increase their share of responsibility for the common defence of the Empire, have been compelled by the present financial stringency to reduce their normal expenditure on defence. We content ourselves therefore with the recommendation that the whole question be examined afresh when their financial situation is more favourable.204. The expenditure on research and technical development of the Services in 1931 is estimated as follows : (iii) Research and Technical Development.Gross.Receipts.*Net.   Navy Army Air Force804,445 615,000 1,600,0005,645 318,000 143,000798,800 297,000 1,457,000Total 3,019,445466,0452,552,800* These consist mainly of interdepartmental payments.
205. This expenditure covers a wide variety of objects. Broadly speaking, it covers very little purely scientific research and is mainly concerned with the application of science to the needs of the separate services. It covers progress in all its forms development of new arms, improvements of existing ones, improvements -in protective devices, means of communication, means of locomotion&apos; and so on. It must be accepted that the Fighting Services cannot stand still, and that development is essential to them. As we have already said, the maintenance of their present high standard of efficiency is more than ever necessary if their restricted size is not to be increased, and they must remain in the front rank of development. We appreciate, also, that some forms of research lead to economy. Protective devices and improved fighting capacity save personnel and material. Research on stores, ammunition, etc., prolongs the effective life of an article and avoids expenditure on replacement. Instances have been cited to us of very sub-stantial cash economies which have been secured by successful research.206. On the other hand, research expenditure is not without its dangers and there are three aspects which we think should be stressed. First, inventions do not long remain the undivided-property of the nation that makes them. A new device may give-one nation a lead over other powers in offensive or defensive capacity but the lead is only temporary and parity is not long delayed. It appears to us that research expenditure is subject to the risk that it may provoke competition in quality which may be just as expensive as competition in quantity, and the taxpayers of the world are not going to benefit by reduction in the size of fight-ing forces if an expensive competition develops in their quality.207. Secondly, successful research may lead to obsolescence of existing assets, and the replacement of such assets by others em-bodying the results of research means continuous expenditure. In the industrial field, an automatic check on excessive expenditure of this kind is provided by the financial results obtainable but no corresponding criterion is available in the field of defence. We believe that the Services are fully alive to the danger of embarking on production before they are certain that the results of their researches are relatively perfect and that, consequently, wasteful expenditure is generally avoided.208. And thirdly, new inventions tend to make the unit of force more and more expensive.209. For these three reasons, we believe that research expendi-ture acquires an importance not fully reflected by its own total10905 0 2
amount. We hope that when international disarmament proposals are under consideration, this important element will be fully con-sidered.210. Our present net expenditure of  2,500,000 is a large sum, and we think it susceptible of reduction. We are not in a position to assess the relative merits of the competing items and to suggest that any particular services on the present list should be excluded. Selection must be left to the experts,who,indeed, at present have to exercise a strict scrutiny over the various items and assign priorities to them in view of the limited funds available. We can only suggest an economy by the rough and ready process of rationing, and we accordingly recommend that an all-over cut of 121 Per cent-of the net expenditure should be made, it being left to a Committee of the Fighting Services to determine how this reduction can best be distributed between the three Services. We believe that in a time of financial stringency such as the present this is a right and proper course to adopt, even if it necessitates a slowing down of research work which the Services regard as of high value. We recognise that after the Disarmament Conference, our research expenditure will have to be further reviewed in the light of cir-cumstances, and it may be that restriction such as we propose cannot be continued indefinitely in the absence of international agreement. We recommend also that in future the total Estimate of expenditure on Research, Experiment and Design in the three Services be submitted separately by the Departments for Treasmy approval before the Estimates are presented to Parliament.(iv) Disadvantage of annual estimating.211. The estimates for the Fighting Services are fixed annually in the light of the demands made by those Services and the ability of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to meet them. We recognise that this procedure is dictated by practical considerations it is, indeed, inherent in our national financial system. But we feel that, in respect of some items of defence expenditure, there are two directions in which it does not conduce to the most economical and efficient use of the funds available. In the first place, under our Parliamentary system any unspent balance on each Service Vote, save in so far as it may be used with Treasmy sanction to make good deficiencies under other Votes, must be surrendered to the Exchequer. At one time there was undoubtedly a tendency on the part of the Departments towards the end of the financial year to accelerate or encourage expenditure in order to avoid surrender of moneys which they had quite legitimately counted
on being able to spend; and though we feel sure that under present conditions this is no longer the general practice, it seems natural to suppose that the temptation to spend money more freely than usual in such circumstances still exists, and is liable to affect, to some extent, the actual amount of expenditure in the last quarter of the financial year. Secondly, there is the question of placing contracts ahead and so committing Parliament to liabilities beyond the current financial year. There is no doubt that, in conformity with the maxim that the King&apos;s Government must be carried on, the Service Departments have the right to enter into long-term contracts for the provision of material, necessarily required for the fulfilment of their constitutional functions, which cannot be completed within the term of a single financial year; but whether that right would extend to the placing of an order for the delivery of say, a number of standard air-craft, each of which could be manufactured within 12 months, for a period of three j^ears ahead, is perhaps doubtful. Of course questions of design and of the future course of markets also enter into the problem; and it may well be that the number of cases in which Departments would feel justified in com-mitting themselves so far ahead, even if they had the power to do so, would be relatively few. Our contention, however, is that, as a matter of sound business practice, they should be given the power to enter into such contracts, subject of course to suitable control over its use.212. With these points in mind, we think that in respect of certain services, for example, Works and Buildings, Research and Tech-nical Development, Purchase of Naval Armaments and Warlike Stores and Aeroplanes a guaranteed income for these purposes over a. series of years* would enable a wiser use to be made of the piovision available; and we would, go so far as to say that, if the principle is approved, the Departments should be content to accept a lower annual average provision over the period in question than their present expenditure under these heads. Reasonably long term planning ahead must, we think, be more economical than an annual programme in which each item has each year to run the gauntlet of internal competition for funds with all other services in the same arm. We have not considered in detail how such a scheme could be worked in harmony with the existing prin-ciple of annual Votes of Parliament, and with the necessities of Parliamentary and Treasury control; but we do not doubt that a satisfactory scheme could be foi-mulated without great difficulty. We accordingly recommend that as regards Works and Buildings,* Subject of course to any change of policy resulting from the Disarmament Conference, and to the exclusion of expenditure on New Formations, to which we cannot expect that either the Government or Parliament would be willing to com-mit themselves in advance.
Research and Technical Development, and Purchase of Naval Armaments, Warlike Stores and Aeroplanes and Engines (and possibly other items if experience showed that such a scheme would be of benefit), either a fixed annual in-come for a number of years or alternatively a fixed total provision over a number of years, but in either case at an average annual rate less than the actual current rate of expenditure, should be promised to the Services. We think that in the first place, as the idea is an experiment, the number of years should be three. It would have to be recognised on all sides that such a promise could not for obvious reasons, be absolute-it would have to be subject to review on major changes of circumstances-but we do not think that this necessary reservation need impair the efficient working of the scheme.(v) Education.213. The net votes for 1931 for Educational Services are :   Navy (Vote 5)   ...      ...       .........      232,000Army (Vote 4)..........    ......      850,000Air Eorce (Vote 6)      ............      484,000 1,566,000These votes include only the pay of the military and civilian staffs. Further expenditure is incurred on other votes for accom-modation, rations, stores, etc., which may be put in round figures at about  1,000,000.The educational establishments cover a wide variety of functions, embracing the training of cadets, higher and specialised training of officers, training of instructors, and vocational training for the men. We think that some of the larger establishments invite comment.Cadet Establishments.214. The Geddes Committee referred to the cost of education at Dartmouth, Woolwich and Sandhurst, and Cranwell. The increases in the fees paid by parents recommended by the Geddes Committee have been made in the case of Dartmouth, Woolwich and Sand-hurst but not in the case of Cranwell, while there has been a substantial reduction since 1922 in the gross cost per cadet at Dartmouth and Cranwell.   At Woolwich and Sandhurst, however,
the cost has increased considerably since 1922. The present figures, based as regards 1931 on the Estimates, are as follows :  Figures given in Geddes Report 1922.Numbersof Cadets.Average grosscost per Cadetper year.Maximum fees payable per year.Figures in Estimates 1931.Numbersof Cadets.Average grosscost per Cadetper year.Maximum fees payable per year.I Royal Naval College, Dartmouth (including nautical training).

In the case of Cranwell, new buildings are in course if construction which are estimated to cost  300,000.Xote. We have no information on the basis on which the figures in the Geddes Report were ^mpiled and we cannot therefore be certain that they are on the same basis as the Estimate &quot;figures for 1931.In the case of Woolwich and Sandhurst, some of the in-crease of cost since 1922 is no doubt accounted for by the fall in numbers. We think that, in this case, a determined effort must now be made to secure a reduction in the overhead costs more nearly commensurate with the fall in the number of cadets.In the case of Dartmouth, where Cadets enter at about 13! we think a substantial part of the cost of providing general education would be saved if the age of entry were higher. We understand thai the conditions of recruitment are at present under in-investigation by a Committee and we hope that consideration will be given to this point with a view to some material reduction in the cost to the State.At Cranwell, the Cadets receive pay at the rate of 7s. a day (49s. a week), from which 4s. is deducted for the cost of messing. We think the balance of pay, viz.: 3s. a day (21s. a week) is a needlessly generous allowance to boys of from 17 to 18 years of age while in receipt of education and training from the State.10905 , c 4
At each of these colleges, the proportion of administrative and instructional staff and of general staff to the number of officers under instruction appears to us to be high and we think reduc-tion should be possible.Royal Air Force Apprentices.216. The Geddes Committee recommended that the scheme of training of boys at Haltoo should be abandoned and they recom-mended the adoption of an alternative policy of recruiting trades-men personnel from engineering shops throughout the country. This recommendation was not adopted.At present, 2,620 apprentices are under instruction, mainly as aero-engine fitters and riggers for metal aircraft. The course lasts three years; and the average annual intake is thus nearly 900. Entry is at the age of 16, and at 18 the boys are engaged to serve for twelve years, i.e., until reaching the age of 30. At that age, they may re-engage for a further twelve years of service.The cost of training, including pay and maintenance, is  179 per head per annum, i.e., a total cost over three years of  537 per apprentice. Amortising (this cost over twelve years of service, the average cost per year of service works out at  59. We think the high cost of this establishment should be reduced.217. The scheme has not yet been sufficiently long in operation for any experience to be gained which would indicate how many of the men will re-engage for the second period of twelve years of service. The present wastage from all causes is 1.5 per cent, per annum.218.

The higher professional training of officers is undertaken at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, the Staff College at Camberley and the Royal Air Force Staff College at Andover.The cost per officer under instruction at these establishments seems excessive particularly as these figures do not include the pay and allowances of the officers under instruction. The figures are : 
Total ...  1,077,000221. The percentage of inspection applied varies according to the type of article concerned.     Where any defect would result inwe have re-examined the recommendations of the Geddes Com-mittee. It appears to us after careful examination that the con-clusions of the Air Ministry on this matter are sound. Industry could not at present train all the apprentices who are required and therefore some measure of State training is essential. Moreover, even if industry could train as many as are required, difference of method would be a heavy disadvantage to a service which places great reliance on uniformity of standard and inter-changeability of personnel. Some training by the State is inevitable to develop the corporate spirit essential to a Fighting Force and to turn out men capable of bearing the wide responsibilities assigned by the Air Council to N.C.O.&apos;s and Warrant Officers.218a. We think, therefore, that the scheme must be continued but we think it should be reviewed from time to time with a view to considering the possibilities of obtaining some recruitment from the trade, particularly if experience shows that there is a high percentage of wastage when the first twelve years of service are completed.General.219. Taking the Education Votes generally, we think that re-duction is possible and recommend that in each service an overall cut of not less than 10 per cent, should be made on the net pro-vision in these Votes, amounting to say  150,000.(vi) Inspection.220. We have been impressed by the large provision made in the Estimates for the Services for the cost of inspection.The total provision is shown in the following table :  Navy        ............      ......      400,000Army       ..................      498,000Air Force..................      179,000
nloss of life or wreckage of expensive. material, no inspection which would lessen such risk, can be considered excessive. Simi-larly, where with a complex mechanism interchangeability of parts is essential to efficient and economical use, reasonable precaution must be taken to ensure that such interchangeability is obtained. On the other hand, in the case of clothing, accoutrements and the like, and even items such as gun carriages, gun mountings, and tanks, inspection is necessary mainly to ensure thait the State is obtaining stores in good condition in return for its expenditure.222. We have no desire to see any reduction in the 100 per cent, inspection applied to stores which are vital to the safety of the personnel or any neglect to ensure high efficiency of essential mechanisms in time of war, but we feel that as regards the stores which do not fall into these categories, the present inspection in-volves a cost which is a disproportionately high insurance premium against delivery of faulty stores. We recommend that the per-centages at present inspected should be reviewed, more reliance being placed on the right to return faulty consignments to the contractor, and we think it should be possible to secure a reduction of not less than 10 per cent, in the present total cost.(vii) Works and Buildings Services.228. The gross Votes for Works, Buildings and Land for the Home Fighting Services in 1931 may be analysed as follows :  	New Works.	Ordinary Repairs and Maintenance.

Air Vote     4   ......	  1,428,850 922,900t 1,228,600	  419,000 1,185,100f 495,000	  926,000* 828,000 422,500	  2,773,850 2,936,000 2,146,000	 3,580,250	2,099,100	2,176,500	7,855,850P * Including  656,450 Annuity, etc., in repayment of Advances under Naval Works&apos; Acts, 1895 to 1905.f After crediting value of stores consumed, etc., on an approximate basis.The gross total is .reduced by receipts from sales of land, Ibuild-ings. and old stores, contributions from Dominion and Colonial Governments, etc., and &quot; shadow-cuts &quot; for possible under-spendings to a net total of  6,754,500.

The reduction in the estimated expenditure for 1931 corn-pared with 1922 is particularly striking, and the net total, allowing for higher prices, and the post-war introduction of air services, also compares favourably with the 1914 expenditure.     - .......The relatively high cost of Air Works services is of course ex-plained by the fact that the Air Force is an expanding service which has compressed into a few years the provision of a complete system of aerodromes and ancillary accommodation both at home and abroad.225. In view of the reductions effected&quot; we are satisfied that the position has now been reached when it is no longer possible to effect large reductions by postponing new works, since as a rule postponement&apos; merely results in&apos; the liability being carried on to future Estimates, and an uneconomical expenditure on extra main-tenance meanwhile. . &apos;226. We think however, that real economies may be&apos;sought in &quot;two directions.(1) We have already recommended the stabilisation of the Works Votes over a period of say three years, at a somewhat lower figure than at present. If the new figure were put at no more than 2f per cent, less than the present net total of  6,000,000 (exclud-ing the Naval Works Acts Annuities), a saving of say  150,000 a year would result.(2) With regard to the cost of new buildings, it appears to us that it may not be necessary in some cases to secure such a high standard of original construction as is now obtained. Owing to the uncertainty with regard to the future requirements of the Services, and the rapid changes in technical development, many of the buildings provided may well have an effective life beyond the period for which they are needed. It is true that we have been told that many Service Buildings urgently require to be replaced, and that the maintenance of many others is being neglected.  But1922-23 (Geddes).  4,756,000 8,185,000 2,166,000
it may be that the adoption of a lower standard all round would enable more of what is desirable, both by way of replacement and&quot; [ of current upkeep, to be carried out within the limit of existing funds.The question appears to us to be worthy of further examination, and we recommend that it be specially investigated by H.M. Government with a view to considering whether further economies can properly be made by a change of policy in this respect.(viii) Contract Procedure. 227. Under this head we make two recommendations of minor importance.(1) In all Government contracts it is the rule that the form of tender shall set out in full all the conditions applicable to tender and contract, making a document of perhaps four pages.   Some of these conditions are applicable to all Government contracts, others .are special; to individual Departments or to individual items of supply.   We think that a small but useful saving of time and stationery would be achieved if in future a copy of the con-ditions which are common to all Government contracts were printed in a separate form and sent to every firm as soon as it is placed on the list of Government Contractors.   Thereafter when tenders are called for, the form of tender wculd merely set out the additional conditions applicable to the tender and state as regards the general conditions that the tender and contract were subject to the general conditions of Government contracts.   We recom-mend that this question should be further explored, and also that consideration should be given to the alternative possibility of con-tractors, on being placed on the list of Government Contractors being given either forms showing conditions of Government con-tracts affecting a particular trade or class of supply, or forms show-ing general conditions of contracts for the particular Department.(2) It is the accepted practice that all Government contracts, for however small an amount, must be placed after calling for competitive tenders.   Industrial experience shows that it is not worth while as a rule to go to the trouble and expense of open competition when the amount of the order is trifling; and we think  that,  notwithstanding  the  Parliamentary  arguments  in favour of the present system, the Government would be well advised to adopt the same rule. We recommend therefore that, for amounts not exceeding  10, the general rule should be that tenders are not called for but that a direct order is to be given to a firm known to be able to supply.   Responsible officers should take steps of course to check the price by reference to tenders for large quantities of similar goods, and should invite supply from different firms from time to time as may be expedient.

This, however, does not represent the full measure of the fall, as in earlier years the Navy drew on stocks without replace-ment a cash saving which clearly could not be obtained in-

These figures show what a considerable reduction has actually taken place in Navy Estimates in the last six years, and are evidence of the results of the continuing efforts which have been made year by year by the Admiralty to restrict expenditure. They confirm the view which we expressed at the beginning of this chapter that major economies can now only be found in further disarmament.231.&quot; We have obtained from the Admiralty a forecast of their future requirements. The only major item of change is for New Construction. The provision made in 1931 is much lower than it can possibly be in 1932 and subsequent years. The reduction in 1931 is the result of the New Construction Programmes of 1928 and 1929 announced to Parliament by the previous Government having been reduced by the present Government with the object of creat-ing the desired atmosphere for the London Naval Conference. The curtailment of these two.programmes naturally produced two years of abnormally low expenditure on New Construction in 1930 and 1931. The subsequent adoption of larger programmes based on the agreements reached at the Conference will necessarily result in the expenditure on New Construction rising from  5,570,515 in 1931 to approximately  8,230,500 in 1932. Assuming that programmes similarly based are approved in 1932 and 1933, the New Construction figures for the two following years will be approximately : &quot;&apos;&quot;&quot;  .....1933 ...    . .........      ...   8,393,1801934.        ...     . ...      ...      ...      ...   -   ...   8,532,750In the forecasts of future expenditure which we made in the opening chapter of our report, we accordingly assumed-on the basis that existing &quot;policy remained unaltered an increase of Navy Expenditure of  2,700,000 in 1932 and 1933 compared with 1931. It is important to note that this estimate makes no provision for new Capital Ships, the construction of which has been postponed by agreement under the London Naval Treaty until after the re-sumption of the Naval Conference in 1935.
232. It is common knowledge that varied opinions are held in the Navy itself as to the wisdom of the policy embodied in certain designs of ships of war. How far, if at all, considerations of cost were allowed to enter into the decision of the Admiralty to adopt, say, the 8 inch 10,000 ton cruiser or the 16 inch 35,000 ton&apos; battleship we&apos; have not enquired. But the difference to the tax-payer owing to the selection of these in preference to smaller types has undoubtedly been very substantial, running into millions of pounds; and it may well&apos;be asked whether the increase in fighting value has been equal to the extra cost. Present conditions it is true, are different. No new ships exceeding 7,000 tons are being laid down at the moment, and the Admiralty have assured us that, when the New Programme for the year is under consideration, the question of comparative cost is constantly in the minds of the Board. We appreciate that the size of a ship is determined by the qualities she is to possess, which in turn depend on the services she is expected to perform and on the qualities of the foreign ships she is liable to meet. Yet it is evident that, even under the re-restricted programme allowed by the London Naval Treaty, there is room for legitimate differences of opinion as to the size of the ships of various classes to be built, e.g., whether a new cruiser shall be of the &quot; Leander &quot; (7,000 tons) or the smaller . class of say 5,500 tons, costing roughly  1,500,000 and  1,125,000 respec-tively. Moreover when the question of the capital ship comes up for further consideration at the 1935 Conference, it is. clear that decisions will have to be taken which will gravely affect the total cost of of naval defence.233. We understand that the Treasury are already given an oppor-tunity to express their views on the financial effect of the year&apos;s Programme, and we attach great importance to this practice of interdepartmental consultation, and to the Treasury being furnished by the Admiralty with full information respecting their plans at an early stage in the discussion of each year&apos;s New Construction Pro-gramme, in order that the Cabinet, when they finally come to con-sider the proposals of the Admiralty, may also have before them the views of the Treasury, based on the fullest knowledge that a layman can be expected to have of the questions at issue.In furtherance of this object, we recommend that,. before the next Naval Conference, the Government should appoint a repre-sentative Committee to enquire into the whole subject of naval design and to consider whether any modifications might be adopted, either with or without international agreement, which would lessen the cost of naval defence without endangering national security.234. We propose now to pass to detailed comments on such of the items of expenditure as appear tons to be susceptible of reduction, though we would again emphasise that substantial savings have already been made and that further economies may be difficult of attainment without some sacrifice of efficiency.
Vote 1 Royal Marines.235. The number of Officers and Men of the Boyal Marines in 1931 is 9,647, and the provision in Navy Vote 1 Subhead B, for their wages and allowances is  1,054,400. In 1922-23, following on the Geddes Report, the number was 13,742, and the cost of wages and allowances  1,346,286.In view of the not uncommon criticism that the Boyal Marines are unnecessary and should be abolished, we have gone care-fully into the question of their utility under present conditions. The Admiralty have satisfied us that the Corps form an integral and essential part of the Naval Forces, performing certain necessary ,-specialist duties on shore, and forming afloat a definite part of the complement of the larger ships which would have to be completed with seamen if the Marines were withdrawn. We are satisfied rfrom the evidence afforded to us that the Corps could not be abolished without a definite and serious loss of naval efficiency.Dockyard Police.236. Following a reference by the Geddes Committee, in 1921, to the excessive number of Metropolitan Police (1665 in all) em-ployed in the Dockyards and other Naval Establishments, such as Victualling Yards and Armament Supply Depots, the Admiralty established a body of less expensive Eoyal Marine Police, recruited from Eoyal Marine Pensioners. As an experimental step 260 members of this force were substituted for an equivalent number of Metropolitan Police at the Armament Supply Depots, with a consequential saving on pay and allowances of  24,000 a year and further savings on pensions. The process of substitution has since been extended to the Victualling Yards, the smaller Dockyards (rosyth, Portland and Sheerness) and other establishments, with the result that the Metropolitan Police now employed are (with a minor exception) confined to the three main Dockyards at Ports-mouth, Devonport and Chatham. (At these three yards there were in 1922, 448 Metropolitan Police, who have since been reduced to 321, costing  99,882 a year in pay and allowances.) Following the experience gained elsewhere, particularly at Sheerness, the Admiralty have recently agreed in principle to the substitution of Eoyal Marine Police for Metropolitan Police at Chatham Dock-yard and the necessary administrative changes are now under con-sideration. A saving of about  50,000 would result from the sub-stitution of Royal Marine Police at all three Dockyards, and having regard to the experience now gained of the new force, we see no reason why the use of Metropolitan Police in Naval Estab-lishments should continue for any longer than is necessary to effect the substitution. We recommend that this matter should be taken up with a view to the realisation of this useful economy at the earliest possible date.
Vote 2.   Cdothing Allowances.237. The Geddes Committee recommended &quot; that in all three Fighting Services the clothing allowance should be reduced by one-third, so that the uniformed forces should, like civilians, economise in their clothes, but it should be definitely understood that the standard of repair of uniform is correspondingly lowered.&quot;The case for such an economy seems even stronger to-day than in 1922; and though a saving of one-third seems excessive, a reduction by 10 per cent, should be possible. The total cost of clothing and allowances in lieu in 1931 is  880,000. On the basis of a reduction of 10 per cent, a saving of  88,000 should be possible in 1932. We understand that Naval Clothing may be purchased either from retailers or under contracts made by the Navy and that the majority of the men adopt the former course although the supplies under Naval contracts are cheaper. It appears to us clear that a saving can be made by the men and that the reduction we propose is not in essence a reduction in pay.Vote 8.   Dockyards.238. Any detailed enquiry into the Dockyards would involve more time than we are able to give. We are, however, aware that the Dockyards have been the subject of full investigations during recent years and we have heard evidence on the actions which have been taken as a result of those enquiries. Accordingly we confine our recommendations on this subject to certain broad questions of principle.239. Following the Report of a Committee under the Chairman-ship of Sir John Biles in 1926, the introduction of a new and modern system of cost accounting in the Dockyards was begun and we are informed that it is now in operation at Portsmouth and Devonport and is in process of introduction at other Yards. It is reported to us that this system is as complete as any yet adopted in commercial shipyards but we have not been able to carry out any investigation.On the assumption that the cost of Dockyard operations can now be accurately ascertained on a basis comparable with outside con-tractors we consider that Naval construction work should only be undertaken in the Dockyards where the cost is definitely not more than it would be if carried out by outside firms. For a variety of reasons we agree that it will still be desirable to carry out ship repairs in the Dockyards apart from the question of competitive prices. If this policy is adopted, the number of men employed in the Yards should be restricted to the number actually required and the recent practice of maintaining the full complements subject only to wastage should be discontinued. It seems to us evident that economy will result from this course, though we cannot place a definite money value on it.
240. Both the Biles Committee and the Hilton Committee (which on the recommendation of the Biles Committee was set up to consider the financial system of the Dockyards) commented on the absence of any regular system for the replacement of plant and machinery in the Dockyards.The Hilton Committee (1927) stated that they believed &quot; that efficient management will be impossible unless the difficulties which under the present procedure appear to prevent adequate replace-ments of machinery are removed.&quot; They therefore recommended that regular &apos;&apos; contributions be set aside annually from Navy Vote 8 to form a plant and machinery replacement and renewals fund for the Boyal Dockyards,&quot; on a system similar to that in force for the Royal Ordnance Factories. They also stated that &quot; in view of the large amount of plant and machinery which now requires replacement we strongly recommend that, for the next five years at least, the amounts provided in Navy Votes and set aside for this purpose should be considerably in excess of the normal rates of depreciation except on plant and machinery now new or hereafter to be purchased. At the end of 5 years the matter should be further reviewed.&quot;Following detailed consideration by the Admiralty and the Treasury a scheme on the lines recommended was worked out under which a fixed sum of  80,000 a year was to be made available for 5 years at least with a view to modernising the plant. This scheme has been in operation since 1929, but, owing to financial stringency, the sum of  80,000 was reduced by  4,000 in 1930 and  30,000 in 1931. We regard this scheme as prudent and likely to result in considerable economies, and we think that the full provision of  80,000 a year should be maintained.Vote 8. Mechanical Transport.241. The Geddes Committee referred to the holding by the Admiralty of 492 Mechanical Transport Vehicles, and recom-mended that the requirements should be reviewed by the Treasury. We have obtained information from the Admiralty on the present position. We find that additional services, not in existence in 1922, now require 65 vehicles but that, deducting these 65 vehicles, the present holding is 360, as compared with the Geddes figure of 492, a reduction of 132.The provision made in Estimates in recent years has been (a) Provision made for new vehicles : 1929 1930 1931 10,000 9,000 7,800
We are informed that the Admiralty keep the needs of each Yard and Depot under constant review, and we make no recommendation on this subject.Votes 8 and 9. Naval Armaments and Naval Stores, Etc.242. The Admiralty have furnished us: with very full information respecting the size and nature of existing stocks, both of naval armaments of all kinds, naval stores, fuel supplies, victualling and clothing stores; the basis upon which reserve requirements are calculated in each case; and the extent to which existing stocks conform to such requirements. We do not think it desirable that we should go into a detailed analysis of the facts; it will suffice to say that, broadly speaking, we have no fault to find with the present Admiralty practice. We note however that considerable modifications of the rigidly high standards which formerly pre-prevailed have been adopted by the Board in recent years under the pressure of financial stringency, apparently without ill effect. We are not prepared to suggest any particular directions in which the process could be carried still further. At the same time, we consider that the Board of Admiralty should continue to give the matter their close attention.1929 1930 1931 73,402 72,445 71,365

The main items of Army Expenditure on which comment is necessary have been dealt with in the general part of this Chapter. Our remaining recommendations on the Army are therefore con-fined to certain minor points.Vote 5.   Subhead J.   War Department Vessels. 244. The following provision is made in 1931 :  (1) Shipping Establishment, Woolwich Arsenal ...     5,250(2) Wages of Crews of Vessels, Pilotage, Towage,etc...................   58,750(3) Construction, Purchase and Repair of boats and Vessels...............   26,000 90,000The War Department vessels number 208, and their crews 366. They are used for artillery targets, and for the conveyance of per-sonnel, stores and heavy guns, coastwise and even for Ireland.It is for consideration whether economy could not be effected by the Admiralty and War Office keeping each other supplied with programmes of the movements of Naval Armament and War De-partment vessels in order that advantage might be taken of oppor-tunities of saving separate journeys in some cases.Vote 6.   Subhead J.   Subsidies for Mechanical Transport.245. Subsidies at the rate of  40 a year are paid to owners of certain types of lorries. The vehicles are to be available for pur-chase by the War Department in case of emergency. The maxi-mum amount payable in any one year is  40,000, but it is not anticipated that the full number will be enrolled in 1931, and pro-vision has been made in Estimates for  20,100.This scheme is clearly not producing the results which were expected and we recommend that it be discontinued. In additionto the saving of the subsidy, there should also be saving from reduction of the staff employed for inspection.Vote 6.   Subhead P.   Light Horse Breeding Scheme.246. This scheme provides for the payment of premiums to breeders to encourage the production of a type of horse required for
the Army. The provision made in Estimates for 1931 is  30,000. In view of the diminishing importance of the horse to the Army, we recommend that this subsidy should be discontinued.Vote 7.   Clothing.247. As in the case of the Navy, we recommend that a reduction of 10 per cent, should be made in clothing allowances. The saving would be  55,000.Ordnance Factories.248. The functions of the Ordnance Factories are (1) to manu-facture warlike stores in peace and war, (2) to provide a nucleus for expansion in emergency, (3) to maintain a check over trade prices, (4) to&quot; provide for experimental manufacture often of a secret nature. These functions demand first that a nucleus estab-lishment be kept at the Ordnance Factories irrespective of actual peace-time needs for warlike stores, and secondly (and of no less importance) that the efficiency of the Ordnance Factories for their proper purposes be kept&apos; as high as possible and the cost of their operations as low as possible, subject to the maintenance of proper conditions of service and to any unavoidable loss caused by the first condition.249. We understand that the &quot; nucleus establishments &quot; at Enfield and Woolwich were revised in 1923 and fixed at 1,050 and 4,332* respectively; that the Enfield establishment was further reviewed in 1929/30, and reduced to 920, to be reached mainly by normal wastage; and that the Army Council now have under consideration the question of reviewing the establishment at Woolwich, where the numbers at present actually employed are still considerably above the present authorised nucleus.250. We recommend that the review of the Woolwich establish-ment should be put in hand at once, and that, when the numbers have been fixed, the question whether it is necessary to place orders in excess of the amount required to keep the nucleus establish-ment fully employed, and, if so, in what proportion such orders should be distributed between the Trade and the Factories, should be considered in the light of their respective cost.As regards wages in the Factories, we refer to chapter III. of our Report, in which we recommend that the preferential rates now paid in Government Industrial establishments should be dis-continued.. *. Excluding the Engineering Department, Central Office, with, say, 2,400 employees.

The largest single Subhead in the Air Estimates is Vote 3, Subhead A,  6,529,000 for Purchase of Aeroplanes, Seaplanes, Aero Engines, etc. This includes some  300,000 on account of New Formations in 1931; the remainder is expended on Re-arma-ment and Maintenance of existing formations (say  5,250,000), and Research and Technical Development ( 914,000). .Apart from restrictions on the size of the Royal Air Force we have considered the possibility of reducing this very large block of ex-penditure in the following directions, viz. : (1) Limitation of expendi-ture on Eesearch and Technical Development; (2) Stabilisation of Estimates ;. (3) Rationalisation of Aircraft Manufacturing Industry ;
(4) Reduction of number of different types of aircraft and aero engines in use by the Ministry; and (5) Liability for the cost of production of Prototype machines. The first two points have been dealt with already in paras. 204 to 212 of our Report and will, we hope, lead to certain economies; we now discuss the last three in order.Rationalisation of Aircraft Manufacturing Industry.253. The number^of firms in receipt of current orders for aircraft from the Air Ministry is 16. They differ widely in size and coni-mand of financial resources, and in the types on which they chiefly concentrate.254. Prima facie we should have thought that the benefits which are commonly found to accompany a wise scheme of amalgamation in other industries, e.g., a reduction of overhead charges, a more economical use of design staff, and a lowering of production costs, would have resulted equally from a well conceived application of the principles of rationalisation to the aircraft manufacturing industry; and we had hoped that the Air Ministry would share our view. The Ministry, however, have opposed the suggestion on a number of grounds, which we do not propose to discuss in detail, but to which we have naturally given due weight. Nevertheless we remain of the opinion that the present number of competing firms, relying in effect for their continued separate existence on the deliberate policy of the Air Ministry in the distribution of orders is excessive, and that some diminution of their number is desirable and can be achieved without involving the disadvantages which the Air Ministry are rightly determined to avoid, in particular a diminution in the present competitive and fruitful activity in design. We wish to make it clear that the form of amalga-mation which we have in mind is not the concentration in a single unit of all the makers of one particular type of aircraft, but the combination, in suitable cases, of makers of different types, which can be treated as complementary to each other, i.e., a vertical, not a horizontal sectionalisation. Although each group need not necessarily produce all the classes and types required, it should make two or three of the classes and as many types in these classes as possible if economies are to be effected. We believe that this process, if introduced gradually, and with suitable precautions, should prove of real advantage both to the State and to the industry, and we earnestly hope that H.M. Government will con-sider by what means they can influence its introduction.Reduction of number of different types of Aircraft, etc. 255  At present there are in daily use in the Royal Air Force not less than 44 different types of aircraft and 35 different types oi
engine, each one consisting of from 2,000 to 3,000 definite numbered parts. Quite apart from the cost of store-keeping, inspection and technical control generally (on which emphasis was laid by the Air Ministry themselves as a material factor in the cost of their overhead charges), it seems obvious that a reduction in the number of different types, both aircraft and engine, should lead to a sub-stantial reduction in cost, by enabling the industry to spread their overheads over a larger output of the same type. The Air Ministry do not of course differ from this view in principle, and are perfectly ready, we understand, to apply it in practice as soon as design has become sufficiently stabilised. They contend however that the time for doing so on a large scale has not yet arrived, the Eoyal Air Force being still in the evolutionary stage; but they hope to carry out a gradual process of reduction as time goes on.256. We attach importance to this as a source of economy, and consider that the Ministry should carry it into effect as and when practicable.Liability for cost of Prolotype Machines.257. At present aircraft in the experimental stage are bought by the Air Ministry either (a) for research in aero-dynamical problems, etc., or (b) for development into types which can be produced in quantity for the Eoyal Air Force.We have no quarrel with expenditure under (a); but we have felt considerable doubt whether purchases under (b) of what -nay be called &quot; prototype &quot; machines are a proper liability of the State; and we have accordingly examined carefully the possibility of leaving it to the industry to develop such machines at their own expense and risk. The case against such a change, put briefly, is that :-(i) It is essential that the E.A.F. should make up in quality for what it lacks in quantity; and the maintenance of the present high standard of technical efficiency obliges the Air Ministry to retain in its own hands the control of technical development instead of allowing design to progress along the lines dictated by the interest or preference of individual manu-facturers.(ii) The Air Ministry must also co-ordinate aircraft design with concurrent engine development, and must have regard to the whole efficiency of the aircraft as a fighting machine, including military load, range, consumption and armament, as well as the more spectacular qualities such as speed.(iii) It is possible that the designer would seek to recover the cost of experimental work from production contracts, and that the consequent saving might not be as great as would at first appear to be the case.
These arguments appear to us to have some force; and in the present state of the industry we think that it would be a mistake to depart from the present system, which should, however, be regarded as a provisional arrangement, dictated by the conditions of development of the industry, and requiring reconsideration as soon as circumstances permit.Vote 2. &apos; &quot;Uniform,.258. As in the case of the Navy and Army, we think that a re-duction of 10 per cent, might properly be made in Clothing Allow-ances.   The saving would be  11,000 a year.Vote 3.  Airships.259. We print as an Appendix to this Report a copy of a letter we addressed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 6th May, 1931, on the subject of Airships.......Vote 4.   Pembroke Dockyard.260. The Air Ministry have explained to us a proposal to transfer a flying boat squadron, from Felixstowe to Pembroke Dock. The construction of the necessary accommodation will cost  107,000. The present cost of maintaining Pembroke Dockyard on a care and maintenance &quot; basis is approximately  5,500 a year, but re-ceipts for the rental of part of the Dockyard not required for Air Force purposes and for the supply of electric current reduce the net cost to about  2,500. The cost of maintenance when the squadron is in occupation will be increased by about  2,000 a year, i.e., the cost of maintenance (over and above the maintenance of the squadron itself at any home station) will be  4,500 a year.Having regard to the fact that we are informed that pres-sure on existing accommodation for Flying Boats in Home Waters renders the provision of a new station essential, that alternative accommodation at Felixstowe would be more expensive and that Pembroke possesses advantages as a station by reason of its situa-tion near the Bristol and St. George&apos;s Channels, we have no re-commendation to make on this proposal.Vote 8. Civil Aviation.261. The Vote for Civil Aviation (Air Vote 8), which does not in-clude provision either for the purchase of experimental civil aircraft or for Airships (both of which are included in Vote.3) is  470,000 net for 1931, including  365,000 net on account of Subsidies to Air Transport Services. We understand that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is to stabilise the net Vote at approxi-mately  500,000 per annum.
262. At present the Air Ministry have entered into contracts with Imperial Airways for the payment of subsidies for 10 years in respect of (a) European services, viz., London-Brussels-Cologne, -London-Paris-Basle-Zurich, and such other services in Europe as may be agreed upon by the Air Council and the Company, and (b) a London-Egypt-Karachi service; and for 5 years from the date of the first through services, which it is hoped will be before the end of 1931, in respect of a London-Egypt-South Africa service. Prom the commencement of the contracts the aggregate liability of the United Kingdom in respect of the two former services is  2,490,000, and in respect of the South African service is  270,000 net. We observe that the placing of the contracts for the European and Indian services, though on each occasion the facts were notified to Parliament in a White Paper, and appear to have met with little or no criticism, would seem to have been contrary to the accepted principle that, except in so far as may be necessary for the fulfilment of their statutory functions, Depart-ments have no constitutional authority to pledge Parliament to provide money in a future financial year. Since 1930 the position has been rectified by the passing of the Air Transport (Subsidy) Agreements Act of that year. We observe also that, while the subsidy in respect of the South African service is shared on what appears to us to be an equitable basis between the United Kingdom Government, the Government of the Union of South Africa and the Governments of the intervening Colonies and Territories, the subsidy&apos; in respect of the Indian service is borne wholly by the United Kingdom Government; moreover, the usefulness of the service has been adversely affected by the absence of a continuation service from Karachi to other parts of India.263. It is possible to argue with great force both for and against the policy of a subsidised air transport service, and we recognise that so long as other countries subsidise their own national services (at far greater total cost than we do), it is impossible for this country to adopt a completely different policy without risk to national prestige. In any case no useful purpose can be served by our discussing the propriety of the expenditure to which His Majesty&apos;s G-overnment is already committed under contract.264. As regards the future, however, we think that the time; has come for a further independent enquiry into national policy, cover-ing such questions as (i) whether it is expedient to enter into any fresh agreements with Imperial Airways, especially during the present financial depression, and if so, on what terms: (ii) whether any such agreement should be confined to fast mail transport only, and if so whether the existing agreements for passenger-equalise-mail service might with advantage be revised, subject, of course, to agreement with Imperial Airways: and (iii) whether the responsi-bility for air-mail service contracts ought not to lie vested in the Post Office rather than the Air Ministry.
265. We observe that the Programme of Eesearch and Technical Development includes provision for an expenditure in 1931 of  48,000 on Experimental Civil Aircraft, of which  5,000 is in respect of a New Programme commencing with the year 1931, involving a total commitment of  40,000. We recognise that, in the present state of the industry, progress in design without the assistance of the Air Ministry, may be slow ; and we hesitate to recommend the abolition of this expenditure altogether. But we think that the results are too remote from our immediate necessi-ties for us to be able to afford provision on this scale under present conditions. We therefore recommend that the New Programme for 1931 be abandoned, resulting in a saving of  5,000 this year, and that the expenditure in future be restricted, subject to existing commitments, to a sum not exceeding an average of, say,  20,000 a year.Vote 10. Air Ministry.266. The gross cost of the Air Ministry Headquarters for 1931 is  656,000 which is 3.11 per cent, of the total expenditure on Air Services. The Admiralty and War Office Headquarters cost  1,154,673 and  837,000 respectively and the percentages are 2.11 per cent, and 1.79 per cent. These comparisons cannot how-ever be taken at face value. The administration of the B.A.F. is more centralised particularly as regards technical, scientific, and inspection services, whilst the Air Ministry also controls Civil Aviation and Meteorological Services which are extraneous to the military service. Further the Estimates of the two senior ser-vices include large sums for retired pay and pensions, in respect of which administrative costs are small. We are assured that if allowance is made for these factors it can be shown that the per-centage costs of the Headquarters Administration of the E.A.F. is not appreciably higher than obtains in the other Services. There has indeed been a steady improvement in this respect in recent years.267. In the case of Admiralty and War Office establishments a comprehensive enquiry was made in 1923 by a Cabinet Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Weir, but the then uncertain state of Air policy precluded its extension to the R.A.F. establish-ments. We recommend that an investigation similar to that conducted by the Weir Committee should now be undertaken for the Royal Air Force as in our view, as there has been a decade of expansion and active development of policy there is a prima facie case for a similar general review of Air establishments. This re-view should cover the whole field of organisation, i.e., Commands as well as Headquarters.
CHAPTER V.DEVELOPMENT.268. The comparative statistics of expenditure given on page 19 show that State expenditure intended to promote economic develop-ruent in this country has increased by  46,000,000 per annum in the past seven years. Such charges, and the similar expenditure on Empire development, appear in many places in the national accounts and cover a wide field. The precise limits of the field are a matter of opinion. We propose in the present chapter to deal with expenditure which should, in our opinion, be looked at primarily from the standpoint of economic benefit. On this basis, we select the following items from the national accounts.CIVIL ESTIMATES, 1931.Class 1. Vote   4.   TreasuryEconomic Advisory Council ...

This total does not include the cost of allied services in con-nection with the above Votes, charged under the Government system of accounts on the Works, Stationery Office, Post Office and Superannuation Votes. Neither does it include expenditure that is being recovered by fees or other charges. This applies to the two token Votes above and to the expenditure of the Post Office on the development of its State enterprises. The large electrical developments now taking place under the aegis of the Central Electricity Board and the Electricity Commission are also on a self-supporting basis.270. If one is to obtain a complete picture of the extent to which the State has undertaken liabilities of a development character since the War it would be necessary not only to include this re-coverable expenditure but also to take account of the heavy capital
6liabilities which have been accepted in connection with unemploy-nient schemes of various kinds. Some of these are only con-tingent liabilities such as the guarantee in respect of principal and interest of loans under the Trade Facilities Acts now standing at  62,000,000 or the liability under the Export Credits Scheme now standing at  4,000,000. In other cases the grants (shown in the above table) represent contributions in respect of interest Or sinking fund or both, which will continue (at a declining rate) for the next thirty years. Since its inception the Unemployment Grants Committee has assisted schemes estimated to cost in all  187,000,000 and on the 30th June, 1931, the capital value of its outstanding liabilities amounted to  39,650,000 which does not include the capitalised liabilities in respect of road schemes trans-ferred to the Road Fund in 1926 (see paragraph 291).271. The other committee operating under the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act, 1929, has, with Treasury approval, promised grants of present value about  8,250,000 towards schemes estimated to cost  35,125,000.272. In reviewing in some detail the great variety of objects on which this expenditure is being incurred we find considerable diffi-culty in elucidating the principles that are being followed, and where they have been made plain to us we are by no means entirely in agreement with them. With the fundamental immediate object of improving employment in this country no one will disagree, nor will anyone dispute that one of the most important lines of advance towards this goal is the economic development of this country; but when we find golf courses, tennis courts and swim-ming baths being subsidised as economic development, when we find roads being constructed at great cost in the remoter parts of Scotland, or to meet holiday traffic on the South Coast whereas the road needs of industry and trade lie rather in our congested urban streets; when we find grants paid to local authorities for 10 years in succession for accelerating work which it was their duty to carry out if it should be done at all; when we find Govern-ment departments giving free of cost to private traders services which more progressive traders are providing for themselves; when we find schemes of land settlement or development proceeding at a cost out of all commercial relation to any results likely to be attained; when in short we see these and many other activities being pressed forward to the embarrassment of the national finances with danger of increased taxation and serious repercussions on the general economic position of the country, then indeed we think it is time for a careful review of the whole policy of development.273. An examination of the field of development expenditure reveals a broad distinction of services into those more or less per-manent in character which have been held to be justifiable as normal activities of  the  State  and  special  measures  of  a  temporary
character relating to the present trade depression. The first cate-gory may be sub-divided into : (a) services in aid of home industries generally;(6) services in aid of particular home industries;(c) State enterprises;(d) Empire development ;the second category we deal with as a whole.These divisions are not entirely watertight; some services fall into more ithan one category and some services which have originated with the trade depression may eventually establish a footing a3 normal services. Nevertheless the classification is a useful guide to any review of the field. The references in the table are to the respective class and vote in the Civil Estimates.I.-NORMAL DEVELOPMENT SERVICES, (a) Services in Aid of Home Industries Generally.(i) Research and standardisation.

general considerations.274. The general criterion which we have in mind in selecting services for consideration in this chapter is that of economic benefit. We do not suggest that it is already a dominant consideration in regard to the whole of this great miscellany of activities, but we are definitely of the opinion that this is demanded by our present economic conditions. This benefit may appear in the form of direct profit on an enterprise; more commonly is it to be found in the general assistance which the State action affords to those engaged in industry. These indirect&apos; gains make it desirable for the State to take a much broader view than the private investor in deciding whether a given expenditure will, or will not, be a profitable investment of the national resources, but the task is thereby rendered much more difficult. The difficulty of making the decision does not however detract in any way from the im-portance of keeping this criterion of economic benefit steadily in view.275. There has in our view been an unfortunate tendency since the war to confuse economic development, or, to put it plainly, profitable development, with what we may term &quot; amenity develop-ment &quot;&apos;, especially in the field of Trade Depression Services. We do not dispute the need for the Government to do its best during a trade depression to break the vicious circle of declining confidence, falling off of investing, growing unemployment and increasing burdens on production. At such a time it behoves the Govern-ment to show its faith in trade recovery and to try to re-establish confidence, fout this will not be achieved by expenditure on amenities likely to increase still further the burdens on production.276. We are aware that expenditure during a trade depression on public works of any kind is often advocated as a means of preserv-ing the morale and physical fitness of the workers and also on the ground that the unemployed have to be maintained in any event and that the nation ought to make some use of their labour. We are not greatly impressed by the first as an argument in favour of amenity development. It is to be expected that the more nearly a scheme approaches ordinary commercial activity of the kind to which the man is accustomed, both in the nature of the work and in the manner in which it is being executed, the more the employ-ment approximates in its effect to normal employment. On the other hand we share the view commonly expressed that to the extent that the employment is unusual to the man, that the work is obviously of little immediate value, that it is&apos; not being carried out under normal commercial conditions, any effect on the man&apos;s morale may be discounted. Even as regards maintaining a man&apos;s physical fitness for his normal occupation there are serious limita-tions to the value to be attached to public works, where the only
1000.-5d 2labour open to the unemployed man is mostly of a heavy manual-character.277. The problem of securing some useful work from the man who is being maintained in idleness is an ancient one and many attempts-have been made to find a solution. A line of argument that has been found very attractive in many quarters proceeds from the fact that the margin between profitable and unprofitable employ-nient is often smaller than the cost to ithe community of maintain-ing a man in idleness. Would it not, so the argument proceeds, be better to subsidise the employer to maintain the man in employment and the country&apos;s trade in its normal channels, rather than pay more to keep the man in idleness. Expressed in this simple form the question would appear to admit of only one answer, but closer investigation shows the danger of grave abuse. It would be im-possible in practice to draw a sharp line in industrial operations between work which would have been done in any event and work which would not have been profitable without a subsidy. Even a stipulation that the subsidy should only be given in respect of un-employed men taken on for the work could be easily evaded by a manufacturer discharging his men and taking them on afresh.; Under such conditions the arrangement might easily degenerate into a subsidy to wages, recalling the classic abuse of the poor law of a century ago, associated with Speenhamland.278. The only cases in which it has hitherto been found practicable to work a system of subsidies to operations of a commercial character are the grants for capital works earned out by public utility com-panies such as railway, dock and harbour companies, where a reasonable degree of assurance is forthcoming that the works would not have been undertaken at the present time without a subsidy.; As long as the operations are of a commercial character and the measure of State assistance does not exceed the saving to the country in respect of the maintenance of the unemployed, an arrangement of this character is not undesirable, but if the test of profit be absent and the State grant be increased above the saving to the community the system may easity become wasteful. We revert to this matter below in dealing briefly with such of the above mentioned services as call for special comment.I. RESEARCH.279. The war gave a great stimulus to scientific research in this as in other countries. It was a vast object lesson to the mass of the people in the applications of science and led to a marked change in the national outlook towards scientific research. This process has been quickened by the many readjustments which post war conditions have made necessary in our national life; in our industries, our methods of locomotion and transport and even in our recreations.    Necessity  is  the   mother  of  invention   and   our
necessities since the war have been many and great. In these cir-cumstances it is not surprising to find a rapid development in research expenditure both by the Government and also by private enterprise during this period.280. We do not doubt that the need for such expenditure will increase rather than diminish. This country is finding its long established pre-eminence in certain basic industries seriously chal-lenged by the sedulous fostering of such industries by other nations in an endeavour to be more self-contained. In regard to other indus-tries the world is turning to rival products and leaving productive capacity in these industries both here and abroad much in excess of probable requirements. It is no use hoping or trying to reverse these tendencies; we must face the fact that much of the decline in some of our most important industries will be permanent and we must turn our attention therefore more and more to the develop-ment of other existing or new industries which demand a higher degree of skill and scientific equipment. The State can render great assistance to this process of readjustment by promoting research and standardisation due precautions being taken against transferring to the State the burden of ordinary industrial research which has become one of the essential costs of production.The chief dangers to be avoided are (a) duplication of effort and (b) the expenditure of money on research, which however interesting does not afford the prospect of benefit to the country commensurate with the cost.(a) The co-ordination of research.281. With a view to preventing duplication of effort it is most desirable that the research work being carried on, not only in each industry but in the country generally, should be properly co-ordinated and that the co-ordinating bodies should include a strong representation of persons in close touch with national needs. Both objects are secured in considerable measure by the present organiza-tion of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Medical Research Council under the Privy Council and we were glad to learn in the course of our enquiry that steps had been taken to establish a somewhat similar Advisory Council for Agricultural Research. The Government will now have at its service three advisory bodies composed of distinguished independent experts fully competent to give advice on all questions falling within their respective spheres which together comprise the whole range of economic research. The common responsibility of these advisory bodies to the Lord President of the Council will facilitate ithe handling of questions falling within the sphere of more than one of them.282. We recommend that as far as is consistent with efficient administration the actual direction of research in the three spheres should be brought under the control of the three Advisory Councils.
In so far as separate research under the direction of any other Department may be thought desirable, it should be incumbent on the Department first .to submit its proposals to the appropriate Advisory Council and to submit their report to the Treasury when seeking authority for the necessary expenditure. In this way the Treasury would have before them the views of scientific experts, fully familiar with the issues involved and well informed of the facilities already available both under Government and private auspices to secure the result desired. Moreover the very fact that such prior consultation had to take place would permit of dis-cussion in the early stages when the proposal was in process of formation. It is at that period that the fullest and most effective co-ordination can be brought about.283. In making this suggestion we recognise that in the case of the Defence Forces there are secret investigations that admit of no such consultation with the civil Departments mentioned. These would be definitely excluded from any such arrangement. But in the formation and development of research organisations of the Defence Forces the closest co-operation with the Advisory Councils should be maintained. With a view to preventing possible over-lapping all programmes of research should be as far as practicable on similar lines with the objectives clearly stated and such pro-grammes should be circulated annually to all Departments concerned. (This procedure operates at present between the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Services).284. It may be difficult at times for the department proposing a new or extended research service to determine whether any particular project falls within the purview of one rather than another of the three Advisory Councils we mention. If the three Councils are in proper association with each other, and we have no reason to doubt that this will be the case, consultation between the Secretariats of the Advisory Councils will ensure that the appropriate Council or Councils are consulted. But to secure the fullest opportunity for effective consultations, arrangements should be made whereby the Secretaries of the three Advisory Councils should meet regularly, say at three monthly intervals. Where matters of major importance are to be discussed, the Chairmen of the three Councils, should be present.285. Our conclusions on this head may therefore be summarised thus. No proposal involving the future establishment or extension of activities involving the creation or addition of scientific research accommodation or staff or the payment to some outside agency for research services should be submitted by any Department of State to the Treasury for approval without a report from the appropriate Advisory Council concerned with Agriculture, Medicine or Seien-scientific and Industrial Research, unless, in cases where National Defence is concerned, the respective Service is satisfied that
the research is of a secret nature or the arrangement is for any other reason impracticable. Even where the funds to be used for the purpose intended are derived from sources other than those normally voted by Parliament, the same procedure should be followed if there is any likelihood of charges falling upon the national exchequer for its continuation or its natural development. In a number of cases the report of the appropriate Advisory Council may well indicate that the proposed activity can best be controlled and financed directly by the originating Department and this is likely to be the case where development work as opposed to re-search work proper is concerned.(b) Financial Control of Research.286. The foregoing proposals should be effective in securing a proper consideration of research activities and in preventing wasteful duplication. The maintenance of a due correlation between the expenditure on research and the benefits to be derived therefrom is a much more difficult matter. This difficulty is acute even in the simple case of research carried on by industrial firms where the benefit can only come in the form of increased profits on the firm&apos;s products. A complete solution of the problem is almost impossible in the national sphere where economic benefit may be obtained in many different ways. There must, of course, be an optimum figure for the national expenditure on each of the three main branches of research, above which increased expenditure fails to bring an adequate return, but opinion will differ widely as to what the figure should be. We do not feel that we can do more than recommend (i) that meetings of the Advisory Councils for industrial and agricultural research should be attended by a Treasury representa-tive when matters of financial importance are under discussion and(ii) that as a general rule State aid should not be given to research which, even if successful, would seem to hold out little prospect of general benefit.287. We do not extend these recommendations to the third Research Council (viz. the Medical Research Council) for the reasons that the element of economic benefit in this field is not as a rule capable of assessment and that the Government contribution re-presents but a small part of the total effort now being made in the field of medical research. The State makes at present an inclusive grant to the work of the Council, leaving the Council entirely free as to the disposal of the money, and we think that this arrangement should continue.288. The object of limiting State aid to industrial and agricultural research which will be of definite benefit to the general community is to maintain the incentive to individual manufacturers to embark on research which will be of direct benefit to themselves.
2. the road fund.289. The road fund, or as it was first termed, the Road Improve-ment Fund, was instituted under the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act 1909 to provide a continuing fund out of which grants might be made for the improvement of roads. It was fed by the produce of excise duties on car licences and a customs duty on petrol. Both assignment of revenue and grants were interrupted during the war but in 1920 the Fund was recon-stituted on a much wider basis. The petrol duty, which had during the war been transferred to the Exchequer, was abolished and the licence duties on motor cars were greatly increased, the scope of the Fund being at the same time widened to include the main-tenance as w-ell as the improvement of roads and certain ancillary services in addition.290. The development of serious unemployment soon after the re-constitution of the Fund led to the launching of a series of special programmes of road works with assistance from the Fund to provide employment. The following table shows the revised estimates of the cost of these programmes to the Road Fund and the Exchequer up to 31st March, 1930 :-	Road Fund.	Exchequer.

From 1925 to 1929 the practice of earmark-ing special schemes as unemployment works was discontinued, but it has been resumed and greatly extended by the present Government.   We refer to this later.
291. The heavy liabilities contracted under the above programmes were slow in maturing and on the 31st March, 1926 the Fund had a, cash balance of  19,512,000; outstanding commitments at the same date being  30,174,000. The Budget of 1926 made substan-tial changes in the finance of the Fund. On the one hand the licence duties on certain types of vehicles were increased. On the other, one-third of the proceeds of the duties on private motor cars and cycles was permanently assigned to the Exchequer as being of the nature of luxury taxation, the two-thirds allocated to the Road Fund being regarded as an appropriate charge for road user. At the same time  7,000,000 of the accumulated balance was trans-ferred to the Exchequer to assist in meeting the exceptional budget difficulties of the year and the Fund assumed the liability for grants that had been made for roads by the Unemployment Grants Com-mittee, then roughly  1,000,000 per annum.292. On the 31st March, 1927 the balance to the credit of the Fund stood at  12,259,000 with total commitments estimated at  27,187,000.- Owing to the fact that roughly two-thirds of the revenue of the Fund is received in the last quarter of the financial year (i.e., the first quarter of the calendar year) a balance of this amount was not in excess of cash requirements. Nevertheless, Budget difficulties being still acute, a further  12,000,000 was transferred to the Exchequer, the Treasury undertaking at the Bame time to make any necessary advances required to finance the Fund each year until its revenue came in.293. Still further breaches were to follow in the system under which motor taxation was to be apphed towards meeting the cost of roads. In 1928 a Customs duty of 4d. a gallon was imposed on petrol in connection with the great scheme of rating reform of that year, the proceeds of the duty being allocated to the Exchequer to assist in meeting the heavy cost of the scheme. That scheme substituted a system of block grants based on such general considerations aB population, rateable value, etc., for a number of the existing per-centage grants, including the grants theretofore made from the Eoad Fund towards the maintenance of classified roads in London and the County Boroughs and non-classified roads in other areas. An amount equal to the discontinued grants was charged upon the Boad Fund as a contribution towards the block grants and in addition the Fund was required to contribute  3,000,000 per annum towards the increased grants that were being made to local authorities to allow for the growth of the block-granted services. The total amount so charged on the Boad Fund is  6,475,000 per annum. Finally in the current year the Customs duty levied on petrol for general revenue purposes has been increased from 4d. to 6d. a gallon.294. The following table summarises the receipts into and pay-mentsi out of the Road Fund for the years 1921 to 1930 omitting loan and agency operations :

&apos;294a. We have already referred to the revival by the present Government of special unemployment programmes of road works. Two main programmes have been announced(i) Five years&apos; programme of works costing  27,500,000; (ii) Trunk roads programme of works costing  21,000,000 with grants from the Road Fund in both cases usually of 75 per cent, or more of the net cost. These grants are additional to any liabilities that have been accepted in connection with London schemes, particularly for cross river traffic. The total commit-ments outstanding under all these various schemes amounted on 31st March last to roughly  60,000,000.295. In view of the long recital of decisions almost without exception tending to impair the solvency of the Fund, it is not surprising to find its finances now in a most unsatisfactory state. The following table supplied by the Ministry of Transport shows the estimated position under existing policies over the five years 1931-1936, but we observe that it makes no provision for interest on the outstanding debt. If this be included, every year of this quinquennium shows a deficit, the debt rising to over  30,000,000. It should be made clear also that this table includes nothing for the Charing Cross Bridge Scheme which with its approaches is estimated to cost the Road Fund over  10,000,000.ROAD FUND.

As it is now being administered, this liability on the national finances and in our view drastic action is necessary to remedy the position. First among the steps we recom-mend is the abolition of the Fund and placing expenditure on road grants on the annual votes of Parliament. The old arguments in favour of the existence of a separate Pund have mostly lost their force. There is no longer any clear cut division between road finance and the general budget either on the revenue or on the expenditure side : the term &quot; Self-supporting Service &quot; is now clearly a misnomer : but what impresses us most of all is the wholly inadequate financial control that is being exercised over road expenditure. It is far easier to get  1,000,000 spent on roads than  100,000 on any service requiring express Parlia-mentary sanction. We do not blame the Treasury for this state of affairs, though Treasury sanction is necessary for all ex-penditure from the Boad Pund. Bather do we regard it as the natural consequence of a system that allocated a rapidly expanding revenue to a particular service irrespective of the needs of the service and with no power reserved to Parliament to check its growth. The Road Fund has come to be regarded by successive Governments as a convenient means of financing grandiose projects without the inconvenience of obtaining Parliamentary approval and providing for the cost in the annual budget.In recommending that expenditure on roads be brought under Parliamentary control we recognise that much of it. is necessary expenditure required to provide for the economic development of the country, but we cannot shut our eyes to the evidence on every
side of heavy outlay on what we have termed &quot; amenity develop-menit,&quot; development largely serving the needs of pleasure traffic in so far as it is required at all by present traffic.297. But it is not enough merely to bring road finance under Parliamentary control : the budgetary position demands that that control should be rigidly exercised to eliminate unessential schemes where possible and in other cases to slow down the rate of expendi-ture to something more nearly approaching what we can afford. The estimated expenditure for 1932 is  34,340,000, including  6,475,000 for the contribution to the Block Grant. This  6,475,000 would under our proposal be voted in future as part of the General Ex-chequer Contributions to Local Eevenue in Class X &quot;Votes 1 and 2 of the Civil Estimates. We recommend that the balance of the Road Fund estimate viz.  27,865,000 be reduced at least to  20,000,000 for each of the next two years. We contemplate that the estimate for road grants in future would be generally on the lines of the estimates given in the table above but with separate details as in the Public Works Estimates for major services; show-ing for each service, total approved estimate, expenditure to the previous 31st March, the amount required for the year and an estimate of the further amount required for completion.298. A limitation of the &quot;Vote to  20,000,000 for the next two years will involve the postponement of many schemes already approved in principle and the slowing down of many others. It should also involve some lowering of the present very high standard of maintenance. As regards new commitments for the future we recommend a very cautious policy, at any rate until existing liabilities are well on the way to being liquidated. In particular we should regard an expenditure of  12,500,000 on a New Charing Cross Bridge with a further  2,000,000 or more on improving the access to it on the northern side, as unwarrantable in present financial circumstances. And an expenditure of  1,850,000 on improving the traffic facilities at the Elephant and Castle, which is only one although an important one of a hundred congested points in London seems to us hardly more justifiable. We cannot afford to deal with London traffic at this rate of expenditure. It is high time that a more extended view were taken of the future finance of London traffic facilities.3.-DEPARTMENT OF OVERSEAS TRADE.299. The activities of the Department of Overseas Trade fall under four main heads :- -(a) Headquarters Staff.(b) Commercial Diplomatic Service.(c) Trade Commissioner Service.(d) Exhibitions and Fairs.
The expenditure of the Department in 1924 and the estimated expenditure for the current year under each head are as follows : Expenditure in1924. 1931.(Estimated).

This vote includes  29,575 for trade exhibitions in the United Kingdom and other publicity activities on behalf of the Empire Marketing Board. This expenditure is recovered as an appropria-tion in aid and will be dealt with later under the heading &quot; Empire Marketing Board.&quot; The policy of the Department is to recover also the whole expenditure on the British Industries Fair except the special grant of  25,000 a year for publicity, but no recoveries-are made in respect of the cost of the main intelligence organization which has increased considerably since 1928. The activities of the-Department have been reviewed on several occasions since its establishment shortly after the war, and the general conclusion reached was that it should be made self-supporting if it were continued at all. On any principles of rationalisation an organi-zation covering all trade and all countries should be able to give better value for money than a private trader, or even an association of traders, is able to obtain by its own representatives.   And
4. RELIEF OF RATES ON INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE.303. Under the Local Government Act, 1929, agriculture was entirely relieved of rates, and other rateable hereditaments, used primarily for purposes of productive industry or of freight trans-port, had their assessment to rates reduced by three-fourths at a total, estimated cost to the Exchequer of about  26,000,000 p.a. These reductions were intended greatly to reduce the adverse effects of rates on industry and were coupled with extensive changes in local government administration and with a radical reform of a large part of the system of Exchequer subventions to local authorities. The relief to agriculture only came into effect on 1st April, 1929, and that to industry generally on 1st October, 1929, and the rapid development of the economic depression in 1930 has made it impossible as yet to form any estimate of their effect on industry in this country. We doubt, however, whether anyone . would now suggest the reimposition of the rate burden even if this course were still practicable. As a matter of fact the financial arrangements under which the cost of this relief has been assumed by the Exchequer are so interwoven with other changes under the Local Government Act and form so integral a part of the elaborate new system of general Exchequer Contributions to Local Revenues that any reversal of the policy of the Act in this respect would be a matter of the greatest difficulty. This new system of State sub-ventions to. local authorities raises wide issues which are most conveniently dealt with in Chapter VII.5. MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.304. The expenditure of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (excluding the Beet Sugar Subsidy) has increased since 1924 as301. We recommend therefore that a policy of recovering the cost from those who benefit should be adopted and steadily pursued. If traders and manufacturers are not prepared to pay for the services they obtain it seems to us self-evident that they do not consider the Department of material benefit to them and no justification exists for its continuance.302. A similar policy of making the Department self-supporting should be kept in mind in connection with the British Industries Fair and other exhibition activities.

While it is true that the expenditure is set out fully in the estimates presented to Parliament, the existence of the large appropriations in aid naturally tends to soften criticism on this Vote. On the other hand when the lump sum grants to the Development Fund and the Empire Marketing Fund are under consideration no information is available on the estimates as to the purposes to which the money will be applied and detailed criticism is hardly possible. The whole arrangement seems to us prejudicial to financial control. We revert to this point later when discussing these two Funds. For present purposes we will deal with the gross expenditure.305. This shows an increase of  770,000 since 1924 and a further increase of nearly  200,000 is anticipated next year and over  100,000 the year after, apart from the cost of new legislation now before Parliament. If allowance be made for unemployment drain-age grants, met from another vote in 1924, the increase since that year is reduced to  560,000. With this correction, the largest increases have occurred in agricultural education, research and
--^^^^^ ..... .improvement of livestock ( 100,000 each), including in the last case animal diseases ( 80,000 an uncontrollable variation), agricultural marketing ( 80,000) and fishery research ( 54,000).Agricultural Education. 306. In present circumstances we are opposed to any further extension of this service and we consider that without contrac-tion of existing facilities some reduction might be effected on the Exchequer charge. The grants for agricultural education average 67 per cent, of the net expenditure, some services attracting a percentage grant of 80 per cent. We regard any percentage grant in excess of 50 per cent, as specially open to objection and we recommend that it should be the maximum grant in future for agricultural education. In view of the reduction in the general level of teachers&apos; salaries recommended in Chapter III the present moment is specially suitable for the change as the reduction in educational salaries will go some way to compensate local authorities for the loss of grant. In this connection we would refer to our recommendation in the following chapter in regard to the elementary education grants.Agricultural Research.307. Pending review of this field of expenditure by the new Eesearch Council we make no recommendation for a reduction in expenditure, although a lower level of educational remuneration will tend to reduce expenditure. We are, however, strongly of the opinion that the existing provision should be made to suffice for the next few years, the cost of any necessary new schemes being met out of savings on existing schemes.Live Stock Improvement.308. Expenditure on livestock improvement now amounts to  61,000 per annum. In so far as the expenditure is directly profitable to the industry it either ought not to be incurred by the State or it should be recovered from the industry. The passing of the Licensing of Bulls Bill should facilitate the considerable reduction on this charge which we think justifiable.Land Drainage, iWdter Supply, etc.309. Prior to 1920 the State made no grants for arterial or field drainage, but acted on the principle that the land benefited must pay the cost. Since 1920, however, the position has gradually evolved that the State is expected to contribute, not only to arterial drainage, but also to local field drainage and water-supply schemes, which are ordinary landowners&apos; improvements. These are the successive stages of evolution : (a) For unemployment purposes, temporarily, the Ministry were authorised in 1920 to make grants to drainage authorities, towards approved schemes of arterial drainage.     These, or
similar grants, have since been continued as part of the policy of reducing unemployment by State schemes of expenditure. The grants were at first 75 per cent, of the net cost, but were subsequently reduced to 50 per cent, of the net total cost or 75 per cent, of the wages bill in each instance.(b) In 1926, for the first time, the Government started a system of drainage grants, not for unemployment purposes, but for the sake of productivity, on the ground that water-logged land impedes production and that the landowners and land occupiers could no longer afford to pay the full cost of drainage works. In 1926 the Government of the day promised, inter alia,  1,000,000 over the next five years for grants to drainage authorities for approved arterial drainage schemes. The grants were fixed at first at 33 J per cent, of the net cost. (Later, in the special case of the Ouse a 50 per cent, grant of  1,250,000 was promised; but the necessary Ouse Bill was defeated in Committee, on local grounds, and no new Ouse scheme has yet been approved.)(c) Two years later, in order to encourage authorities to employ &quot; transferred labour &quot; from the depressed areas, it was arranged that the grants under (b) should be 50 per cent, in special cases where the prescribed proportion of transferred labour was employed.The estimated cost of existing schemes under (a), (b) and (e) in 1931 is  132,000.(d) As part of the Autumn programme of 1929 for dealing with unemployment, temporary grants were given to land-owners, for the first time in England, towards the cost of approved schemes of local field drainage, water-supply, etc. Those grants still continue and are normally 33J per cent, of the net cost, but 50 per cent, is paid where transferred labour is employed.   The estimated cost in 1931 is  60,000.(e) Finally, in 1930, a new Land Drainage Act, which created Catchment Boards for all the main catchment areas, gave rise to a fresh type of grant towards the cost of arterial drainage schemes. Previous grants had been temporary grants, either for unemployment purposes or for productive purposes (with,in this last case, a fixed total money limit). The grants now promised to Catchment Boards towards the capital cost of new schemes are, in effect, a normal and permanent part of the grant system. Despite the fact that arterial drain-age in the past has been self-supporting, and that the 1930 Act eases the financial difficulties of the owners and occupiers of flooded land by creating new powers of rating the whole catchment area, including the &quot; uplands &quot;, the new authori-ties have been promised a regular system of grants in future, where the need is established, towards approved Catchment
Board schemes in future. The rate of grant is not fixed but is to be determined with due regard to the rateable value of the area and to local burdens.  58,000 is provided for these grants in the 1931 Estimates; and, as schemes involving many millions of pounds may develop in the course of the next ten years, the future potential burden on the Vote is very heavy.We recommend: (a) that the scheme for grants to landowners should be terminated forthwith,(b) that the grant to any drainage schemes promoted by a drainage authority should not normally exceed 25 per cent, of the cost, this representing the estimated saving to the State in the maintenance of the unemployed. In this con-nection we would refer to our remarks below on the grants of the Unemployment Grants Committee. This would neces-sitate the abolition of the existing limit in section 22 (2) of the Land Drainage Act, 1930, on the amount chargeable on the rates, and(c) that special consideration be given to Catchment Areas in which, owing to low rateable value, the cost of a necessary major improvement would impose an excessive burden.Agricultural Marketing.310. The total estimated cost of agricultural marketing in 1931 (including Administration provided for in Subheads A and B of the Vote) is  131,000, of which amount  113,000 is to be met from the Empire Marketing Fund.  76,000 is to be spent on marketing work and  55,000 on &quot; foreground &quot; publicity&apos;. The latter sum falls really on the Exchequer, and not on the Empire Marketing Eund, as a special addition is made to the Fund for the purpose, over and above the general lump sum provision&apos; which the Marketing Board spend at their discretion. This &quot; foreground &quot; publicity has served to familiarise the public with the national mark scheme, and we think that this expenditure may now be discontinued except in so far as the producers are prepared to meet the cost.311. We consider that by proceeding on the general lines in-dicated above it should be possible to reduce the provisional fore-cast of the gross expenditure of the Ministry for 1932 by not less than  500,000. As the provisional forecast for 1932 is  183,000 in excess of the estimate for 1931 this would represent a gross total of  317,000 below that for the current year.Land Settlement.312. We have reserved till last the difficult question of land settle-ment, as the existing charge in the Vote for this service is contrac-tual in character and any alteration of policy can only affect future
growth : moreover the position is complicated by the new legis-lation at present before Parliament.   Three schemes have been operated up to the present : (1) The pre-War scheme under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908.(2) The   post-War   scheme   under  the   Land   Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919.C3) The current scheme under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1926.       &apos; 1. Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908. County Councils were first empowered to provide small holdings under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908.   Money for capital expendi-ture was provided from the Local Loans Fund at 3J per cent, interest. Schemes were to be self-supporting, and in order to facilitate this the Ministry could pay (i) the costs (i.e. legal, etc.) of acquir-ing land and (ii) half the costs of ascertaining the demand.   If &apos; in fact losses were subsequently incurred the Ministry could pay half the losses, the other half falling on County funds.   This arrangement continued in force up to 1919, when by the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act of that year the Ministry was authorised to recoup all losses reasonably incurred by Councils in the adminis-tration of the Acts.   The sums paid by the Ministry under these provisions in respect of the period 1st January, 1908 to 31st March, 1919, were as follows :   Half losses on Schemes   ...      ...      ...      ...      3,644Costs of acquisition ...      ...      ...      ...   267,678Half cost of ascertaining demand ...      ...      ...     13,712285,034Additional payments made under the Act of 1919   111 ,244 396,278To the extent to which there were losses or profits in subsequent years these were merged in the deficit under the post-war Land Settlement Scheme.   According to returns furnished by Councils at 31st March, 1926 (the latest date for which separate figures are available), the expenditure incurred and the holdings provided under the Act of 1908 were as follows : Area acquired and let or sold for small holdings at 31st March, 1926 : Acres.Acquired by purchase  ...      ...   137,212Acquired by lease       ...       ...     49,206- 186,418No. of men settled and still in occupation   ... 12,340Approximate capital expenditure    ...      ...    5,350,000Approximate   average   capital   expenditure per man settled      ...      ...      ...      ...  433
2. Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919. The post-war scheme was designed to settle ex-service men on the land. The necessary funds were advanced out of national revenue to the County Councils as agents of the State which assumed liability for all losses. Owing to the, high cost of building and the high rates of interest charged on the loans (about Q\ per cent.) these losses have been very heavy. In order to give the County Councils an interest in efficient management reimbursement to them since 1st April, 1926, has been on the basis of loan charges, etc., less estimated net income from the holdings averaged over a period of 60 years or more. Payments during the last four years have been as follows :   1927   ......      ..........    ...      ...   886,0001928  ......      .........      ...      ...   876,0001929...............      ...      ...   849,0001930  .....................   845,000The payments will gradually decrease in amount up to aboutthe year 2000 by reason of the termination of leasing schemes andthe repayment of loans.   The principal facts of the scheme may besummarized as follows : Area acquired and let or sold in small holdings at 31st March ,.1926 :-Acres.Acquired by purchase ...      ...   223,000Acquired by lease       ...       ...     33,000- 256,000Approximate No. of men settled and stillin occupation        ...      ... ... 16,000Approximate capital expenditure ...       ...    15,250,000Approximate   average   capital   expenditureper man settled and still in occupation ...  953Present    annual   loss   per   man   settled(approx.)     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...  53In order to show the part played by high interest charges in the-loss it may be mentioned that a reduction of 1 per cent, in the rate of interest would have reduced the average annual loss from  53 to  45 per annum.Under Section 18 of the Act of 1919, Councils were empowered to make or guarantee loans to their tenants to assist in the pur-chase of livestock, fruit trees, seeds, fertilisers, and implements.. The loans were repayable with interest and the position at 31st March, 1926, was as follows : :No. of loans guaranteed   ...      ...       ...      ...       1605 Amount of loans guaranteed      ...      ...      ...   175,838Amount repaid by tenants       ...      ...      ...    81,965.

In practice, however, most councils have hitherto obtained their advances from other sources.The comparatively high average capital cost per holding under the Act of 1926, as compared with the earlier schemes, is entirely due to the fact that the holdings provided by Councils since 1926 have been mainly of the fully equipped self-supporting type, whereas under the Acts of 1908 and 1919 a much larger propor-tion of the holdings consisted of small areas of bare land let with-out equipment to men resident in the locality.   The average size(a) that a large proportion of the tenants entered into posses-sion of their holdings and purchased their stock when prices were at their highest, and these men lost a great part of their capital as a result of the heavy fall in prices during the next few years :(6) that many men, including a number who were partly disabled,, were accepted as tenants although their qualifications were below the standard that would ordinarily be required.3. Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1926. Under the scheme now current the Ministry is empowered to contribute not more than 75 per cent, of the annual losses incurred by councils in the provision of small holdings under the Act, the contributions to be fixed in advance on the basis of proposals and estimates sub-mitted to and approved by the Ministry. The remainder of any annual loss is borne by the Councils. The following statement indicates the position up to the 31st March, 1931, as regards schemes for the acquisition of new land either definitely approved or under consideration : 
of the holdings provided up to 1926 was about 15 acres; since that date the average, as indicated by the above figures, has increased to about 28 acres. Under the Acts of 1908 and 1919 the propor-tion of equipped holdings was only 30 per cent, and 46 per cent, respectively; under the Act of 1926 the proportion is 70 per cent. These increases account for the increased average capital cost of the holdings, despite which the average loss per holding is lower than it was under the Land Settlement Scheme owing (a) to de-creased cost of building generally, and (b) to the lower rate of interest on loans.The total capital expenditure under the three schemes above mentioned is as follows : - Act of 1908     .........      ...      ...      5,350,000Act of 1919      .........       ......     15,250,000Act of 1926     .........      .:.      ...        997,000Total      ......    21,597,0004. Agricultural Land (Utilisation) Bill. Yet another scheme of land settlement has recently been proposed to Parliament in the Agricultural Land (Utilisation) Bill. This scheme is intended to empower the Government itself to provide small holdings and allotments for unemployed persons. The existing powers and duties of local authorities are not curtailed but power is given to the Minister to provide small holdings and cottage holdings for ordinary applicants where the County Council is not adequately meeting the demand. The financial memorandum attached to the Bill estimates the average capital cost of the ordinary small holding at  1,100, and the net return on this investment at about 3 per cent. As regards the provision for the unemployed it is contem-plated that the holdings will be of the poultry or market garden type, being provided in the neighbourhood of a man&apos;s present home. On this basis the average capital cost is put at  640, yielding an estimated return of 2 to 2^- per cent. In addition a maintenance allowance averaging  40 a case is allowed for the initial period and provision is made for loans of working capital estimated to average  275 a holding making in all a total capital provision of  955. In so far as any of these loans has to be written off the very low return on capital indicated above will be still further reduced.313. We find great difficulty in making any precise recommenda-tions on the subject of small holdings. On the one hand we appre-associate the great importance to the economic life of the country of in-
creasing the agricultural population and the home production of food : on the other hand the nation cannot afford investments that only bring in a return of 2f or 2 per cent, or less. Above all else we would emphasize the importance of making the holdings as nearly economic as possible. The first and most important step to this end is the selection of suitable men whether now in employ-ment or not for settlement. Secondly, the holding should be adapted to the kind of farming promising the best returns under modern conditions. At a time when arable production in other countries as tending towards greater and greater units with increasing mechanisation it would be throwing money away to endeavour to compete in the grain markets with units of 20 or 30 acres. Thirdly, granted the right types of holding, the size and the capital expenditure should be adjusted to those types to give the maximum possible return on the capital. Fourthly, the success of a holding of the type that we have in mind is wrapped up with efficient co-operative marketing that will secure to the small holder as large a share as possible of the retail price of the product.314. We recognize that it is easier to make such generalisations as the foregoing than to put them into practice; we believe that the best lines of development in this matter will be arrived at by a process of experiment. For this reason, and also because of the very unstable price conditions, we are opposed to any spectacular development of small holdings at the present time. Bather would we advise a policy of careful and judicious experiment on a scale wide enough to yield reliable results. One essential to success is a proper adaptation of plans to local conditions which vary so widely over the country^ From this point of view we would deprecate any policy tending to centralise the administrative re-sponsibility for small holding development in the hands of the Government. If it should be deemed essential to take power for the Government to act in default of a county council, a course some-what opposed to British conceptions of local government, such action should only be at the cost of the defaulting council; other-wise small holding development everywhere will tend to be left to the Government.315. One final comment we would make on another aspect of the Agricultural Land (Utilisation) Bill. At a time when there is grave danger of land going out of cultivation owing to the low prices of agricultural produce, the greatest caution should be used in spending the national resources in endeavouring to bring back into cultivation land which was found to be unprofitable even under the more favourable conditions of previous years. In our view land should only be acquired for reconditioning or reclamation where there is clear evidence that it can be subsequently sold without loss.

The main increases have arisen on the grant to the
317. We would refer in this connection to our comments on the expenditure of the Vote for the English Ministry of Agriculture, most of which are applicable also to this Vote, but the item, Arterial Drainage, calls for special comment. The Scottish Drainage Act makes no provision for Catchment Boards with the power to levy on local rates such part of the cost of arterial drain-age as cannot be recovered from persons directly benefiting. We can see no ground for such differential treatment. To take a drainage scheme now under consideration as an example, residents in the Kelvin Valley have obviously much greater interest in stopping the flooding by their river than have the rest of the country. We recommend, that the Scottish Drainage Act be brought into line with the English Act in this respect. Having regard to this recommendation and to our general comments on the corresponding English Vote we think that the provisional gross forecast for 1932 should be reduced by  75,000, i.e., to  682,000, which is  42,000 below the gross estimate for the current year.7.-DEVELOPMENT FUND.318. The Development Fund (like the Road Fund) was estab-lished by the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act 1909 in order to provide for grants or loans to Government Departments, other public authorities and associations of persons not trading for profit for any of the following purposes : (a) Aiding and developing agriculture and rural industries by promoting scientific research, instruction and experiments in the science, methods and practice of agriculture (including the provision of farm-institutes), the organisation&apos; of co-operation, instruction in marketing produce, and the extension of the provision of small holdings; and by the adoption of any other means which appear calculated to develop agriculture and rural industries;(b) Forestry (including (1) the conducting of inquiries, ex-periments, and research for the purpose, of promoting forestry and the teaching of methods of afforestation; (2) the purchase and planting of land found after inquiry to be suitable for afforestation) ;(c) The reclamation and drainage of land :(d) The general improvement of rural transport (including the making of light railways but not including the construction or improvement of roads);(e) The construction and improvement of harbours;if) The construction and improvement of inland navigations;ig) The development and improvement of fisheries;
and for any other purpose calculated to promote the economic development of the United Kingdom.Such grants were to be made by the Treasury on the recom-mendation of an independent body of five Commissioners each appointed for ten years, one retiring every two years.319. In 1919 the powers and duties of the Commission in regard to forestry were transferred to the Forestry Commission established under the Forestry Act 1919 and in the same year its transport functions (except in regard to fishery harbours) were assigned to the newly created Ministry of Transport.320. Under the Act of 1909 grants to the Development Fund at the rate of  500,000 per annum were to be made in 1910-11 and in each of the next four years, out of the Consolidated Fund. In addition  400,000 was provided on Parliamentary Votes in 1910-11. No further Vote was made until 1921, when, under the Corn Pro-duction Acts ([Repeal) Act 1921, a special grant of  850,000 was made to the Fund for the purpose of aiding and developing agri-culture in England and Wales in the manner specified in para-graph (a) of the original Act, quoted above. At the same time a similar grant of  150,000 was made to the Agriculture (Scotland) Fund.

We have dealt on the Votes of the two agricultural depart-ments with the grants paid by the Development Commission through these Votes. Our recommendations in that regard will have their reaction on this Vote for next year and any savings involved have already been taken into account. As there stated we do not con-sider this system of payment of grants out of a lump sum Vote through the Votes of other Departments conducive to sound financial control. The establishment of the Advisory Council for Agricultural Research will no doubt lead to the whole matter coming again under review in the near future. We would favour the association of a small executive branch with the Advisory Council to take entire charge of agricultural research including the responsibility for aiding research institutes. It should be the first duty of the new Council to review all the expenditure of the institutes in order to ascertain what savings, if any, can he effected in the large grants now voted for this service, whether by the abolition of any redundant institutes or otherwise. Agricultural education might remain within the purview of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, being entirely charged to that Vote without any appropriation in aid from the Development Fund.

This leaves practically only fisheries and fishery harbours within the sphere of the Development Commission, and highly as we appreciate the valuable services rendered by the Commission up to the present, we doubt whether it would foe justifiable to main-tain a separate organization for them alone. Fishery research is already the administrative responsibility of the two Fishery De-partments and any expenditure that is necessary might remain a final charge on their respective Votes. Fishery harbours are a transport facility and would naturally fall within the purview of the Ministry of Transport.These harbours have recently become very costly to the State, giants and loans for capital improvements at Scottish fishery harbours alone having amounted to  140,000 in 1929, and  85,000 in 1930. These figures include part of the cost of a general scheme of minor repairs and free dredging, estimated to cost  21,000 in 1931. We recommend that this scheme should be terminated forthwith and that commitments in respect of these harbours be kept as low as possible in future, any necessary maintenance work being provided for by the local harbour authorities with the aid of the local municipality as in England.8.-beet sugar subsidy, great britain.324. The Beet Sugar (Subsidy) Act, 1925, provided for the pay-ment of a subsidy on sugar and molasses manufactured in Great Britain during the period between the 30th September, 1924, and the 1st October, 1934, from beet grown in Great Britain, and at the same time reimposed the Excise Duty on sugar and molasses manufactured in Great Britain and Northern Ireland from home-grown beet. The rates of subsidy are on a diminishing scale, being at the full rate for four years, and then falling by one-third for the next three years with a further reduction of one-third for the last period of three years.   The figures are as follows :

Since the subsidy was started in 1924 the price of sugar has fallen to less than one-third of 1924 average : Annual Average Price of Raw Sugar *ex-Duty, c.i.f.

By improvements in technique and greater through-put manufacturing costs were reduced on the average by 5s. 6d. per cwt. between 1924-5 and 1929-30, but this has not been adequate to meet the difficult situation resulting from the latest reduction of the subsidy coinciding with an unprecedentedly low price of sugar and the Government has agreed to make a loam up to Is. 3d. per cwt. on 300,000 cwt. of sugar per factory for 1931-2 subject to the loan plus the price of sugar not exceeding 7s. 9d. a cwt. This loan is estimated to cost  225,000 this year.* On the basis of 96 degrees polarisation.f The figures in the above Table for the years up to 1928 are taken from the &quot; World Sugar Situation &quot; Report by the Economic Committee of the League of Nations, dated July 4th, 1929, C.303.M.104.1929.II. The figures for 1929 and 1930 are the average of market quotations.
327. If allowance be made for the value of duty preferences as well as direct subsidies, the total State assistance given to the British Sugar Beet Industry up to 31st March last is estimated at  29,710,000.During the operative year 1930-1, 3,060,498 tons of beet were grown by 40,413 farmers on 348,920 acres and the output of the factories reached 418,000 tons of white sugar and 105,300 tons of molasses, the total cost to the Exchequer being  2,670,000 in duty preferences and  6,140,000 in subsidy a total of  8,810,000. The amount of employment in field and factory provided by the industry for every 100 acres of beet is estimated at 8f man-years thus: Field about.........       ......      7-J- Man-YearsFactory about    .........       ...      1&amp; Man-Years8f Man-years the total State assistance to the industry during the year 1930-31 works out at nearly  300 per man. If the direct subsidy only be taken into account the cost for each worker was about  200 a year and with the reduction of the subsidy this year this rate has now been halved (leaving out of account the temporary loan of  225,000 previously referred to). It cannot be claimed that this was entirely additional employment; on the other hand allowance must be made in any balances of accounts for the value of the beet crop as a preparation for other crops.328. The State is obviously under contractual obligations to con-tinue existing arrangements until they are due to expire in 1934.9. FORESTRY COMMISSION.329. The Forestry Commission was set up in November 1919 under the Forestry Act 1919. Its objectives were broadly to get re-constituted the woodland areas cleared during the war, and by afforestation, to provide a reserve of timber growing in the country. The scale of operations was based on the Acland Report (Cd. 881) which recommended :  (a) The maintenance of the existing woodland area, 3 million acres, in a state of productivity.(b) The afforestation with conifers of If million acres at the rate of 1,180,000 acres in the first 40 years including 150,000 acres in the first decade.
(c) The establishment of a Forestry Fund with financial pro-vision for the first decade (1919-29) of  3,500,000 plus working receipts.330. The recommendation of the Geddes Committee that tho State afforestation be discontinued was not accepted by the Govern-ment of the day but the rate of planting was greatly reduced.331. In July 1924 the new Cabinet approved an expansion of the afforestation programme and the establishment of forest workers&apos; holdings. A supplementary estimate of  275,000 was accordingly presented and a larger programme embarked upon. The restriction of the service which had followed the recommendations of the Geddes Committee was abandoned, and in the end  3,364,012 in addition to the revenue from the sales of forest products, which rose from  33,000 in 1920 to  147,000 in 1928, was spent in the 10 years 1919-28 inclusive.138,279 acres were planted by the Commissioners, 76,736 acres by corporate bodies and private individuals under a system of plant-ing grants and 558 forest holdings were established in the same period. The amounts voted either direct for the Forestry Corn-mission or on the Relief of Unemployment Vote for forestry grants were as follows :  Forestry Commission   Relief of Un-Vote. employment Vote.   1919 ......      ...... 99,000 -1920 ............ 379,000 -1921 ............ 200,000 250,0001922 ............ 20,000 50,0001923 ...      .......... 153,000 100,0001924 ............ 453,000 30,0001925 .........      ... 300,000 -1926 ............ 385,000 -1927 ............ 595,400 -1928 ......      ...      ... 485,600 -1929 ............ 600,000 -332. In July, 1928, the then Government undertook to ask Parlia-ment to vote as grants in aid of the Forestry Fund over the ten financial years 1929 to 1938 the aggregate sum of  5,000,000 on the understanding that annual Votes should be kept as low as possible in the first years of the decennium. This provision, coupled with an estimated revenue from forest products of  1,400,000 was ex-pected to be sufficient to provide for the afforestation of 225,000 acres (as against the &quot; Acland &quot; programme of 150,000 acres Government planting in the first decennium) in addition to replant-ing of 12,000 acres of existing State forests and  140,000 for grants to corporate bodies and private owners, equivalent to about 47,000 acres of private planting.   It also included  1,000,000 for forest
workers holdings. The whole matter was again reviewed by the Select Committee on Estimates who reported in April 1929 that, on the basis of calculations made by the Forestry Commission, about 60 per cent, of their expenditure might in certain circum-stances be expected to j7ield a net return up to 3.7 per cent.; the remaining 40 per cent, would yield no return Or but a small return. It was not possible, moreover, they said, to draw a firm conclusion that 3.7 per cent, is the true return, even on the capital directly involved and securing an appreciable return, because : (a) Part of the expenditure on forest workers holdings and on education and research should be debited against the afforestation scheme;(b) The calculation of maintenance costs was prima facie too low;(c) Figures taken for acquisition costs needed recon-sideration in the light of the latest data available.They added that : (1) Whilst under present conditions of costs and prices afforestation could not prove a remunerative investment for public funds, there was a probability of its becoming one at some future date :(2) from the point of view of providing employment the results obtainable from the policy of afforestation (say up to 3 men per 100 acres) were disappointing. 333. In September 1929 in view of the growing unemployment the present Government decided that the  5,000,000 programme for the  second  decade  should  be  increased  to   9,000,000  to  be provided as shown in the table below which also gives the area to be planted each year.    New acquisition was to proceed at the annual rate of 60,000 acres plantable land and 2,500 acres of cultivable land, the latter to provide for an additional 3,000 forest workers&apos; holdings.Year.

Total...... 11,275,000334. As events have proved, the Forestry Commission^ require-ments for the first three years of the second decade have fallen con-siderably short of their programme figures : Programme Voted. figure.   1929     ...      .........     600,000 784,0001930     .............     837,800 842,0001931    ............     665,000 880,0002,102,800 2,506,000i.e., a difference of  403,000 over three years. This difference is principally due to delays in acquisition. In the 12 months ended September, 1930, the Commission acquired less than half their programme area of 60,000 acres. This has affected not only planting but also the provision of forest workers&apos; holdings.335. The estimated expenditure for the current year is  1,049,380 gross and  890,000 net. It was expected that the balance on the 1st April last would be  225,000 and an estimate for  665,000 has accordingly been submitted to Parliament as the grant in aid for the current year.336. The action taken by this country in connection with affores-tation since the War is an admirable illustration of that alternation between expansion and retrenchment referred to in our opening chapter. As an investment of the national resources an estimated return of from 2 per cent, to 2  per cent, has no attractions. As against the prospect of higher prices of timber in the remote future we would urge the probability :-(1) of substitutes for timber being developed; failing which(2) of forestry development in other lands where it can be carried out much more cheaply than in this country. Exchequer grants       ............     9,115,000Working receipts        ............     2,160,000
337. As a safeguard for this country in time of war we naturally find some difficulty in forming any idea of war conditions half a century or more hence, if unfortunately war is then still the ultimate resort of disputing nations. The probable development of timber substitutes has also to be borne in mind.338. Finally, if afforestation be considered as a means of settling the unemployed on the land we would point out that an expendi-ture of  140 per annum is required to find full-time work for one man and that the capital cost of providing a forest worker&apos;s holding wherein he can find part-time employment to supplement his work in the forest is estimated at from  400 to  600. In the great majority of cases the creation of a forest worker&apos;s holding is not required to secure the necessary labour for the forests, these being usually within -easy range of existing labour supplies.339. After weighing up all these considerations we recommend that no fresh acquisitions of land be made for the present and that no more forest workers holdings be created, but that afforestation proceed at the rate of 20,000 acres per annum for 5 years on the land already acquired. This course is estimated to save  478,000 next year and  560,000 per annum in subsequent years as compared with the present policy.10. EMPIRE MARKETING BOARD.340. The Empire Marketing Board was established in 1926 with a ministerial assurance that an income of  1,000,000 per annum ( 500,000 in ithe first year) would be provided as :a grant in aid of a Fund, from which assistance might be given towards the marketing of Empire products (including home products) in this country. The full sum has not been provided since the first year and the actual grants to the Board have been as follows :       J1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 (Est.)10905500,000 400,000 500,000 550,000 612,500 659,000b 2

After giving careful consideration to the work of the Board we feel bound to recommend its abolition. As far as grants for home purposes are concerned, the objections we have already raised to the existence of a separate Development Fund apply with even greater force to the present Fund, because it fulfils no. useful restraining or co-ordinating purpose. Bather does it lead in many cases, in our opinion, to a measure of Govern-ment assistance being granted to a service through two, sometimes three, different channels greater than would be accorded if the whole were set out on a single Vote. But apart from this, we regard the continuance of the Board as unjustifiable in existing financial circumstances. In so far as any of its activities involve definite commitments or are such as to justify continued State assistance for the benefit of home industries they should be pro-vided for on the Vote of the appropriate department. We esti-mate that the abolition of the Board will involve a saving of about  400,000 in 1932 additional to the savings already allowed for on the gross expenditure of the two departments of agriculture.
11. COLONIAL DEVELOPMENT FUND.343. The Pund was established under the Colonial Develop-ment Act, 1929, to enable advances to be made from the Imperial Exchequer to develop agriculture and industry in non-self governing Colonies and Mandated Territories and thereby to promote commerce with or industry in the United Kingdom. Advances from the Fund are made to the Governments of the territories concerned by the Treasury with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for the Colonies (or the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in certain cases), and on the recommendation of an Advisory Committee. The advances may take the form of loans and grants ahd may be applied by the Government to which they are made either directly or through any person or body of persons.344. The Fund is fed from moneys voted by Parliament, which must not exceed  1,000,000 in any one year. All sums received by way of interest on. or repayment of, advances made by way of loan from the Fund are to be paid into the Exchequer, and not into the Fund. The sum of  750,000 was voted for 1930-1. For 1931-2 Parliament is being asked to vote  750,000 which, with the estimated unexpended balance of the  750,000 voted for 1930-1 was calculated to permit of advances from the Fund up to a total of  1,000,000 in the year ending 31st March, 1932.345. Up to 31st March, 1931, the Committee had recommended assistance towards various schemes totalling  2,904,374, spread over a period of years. Of this sum,  989,935 represents free grants of capital,  1,084,909 direct loans from the Fund, and  829,530 free grants of interest upon moneys borrowed by Colonial Govern-ments to meet expenditure on approved schemes. According to the preliminary estimates furnished by Colonial Governments when submitting their applications the total assistance recommended,  2,904,374, would have been distributed as follows :      1930 ... 934,506 1933 ... 443,743 1936 ... 42,600 1931 ... 675,065 1934 ... 103,639 1937 ... 34,000 1932 ... 562,620 1935 ... 48,200 1938 ... 10,000 There has, however, been a considerable postponement of ex-penditure from 1930-1 to 1931-2 and the amounts likely to be called for in respect of schemes already approved will tend to be increased except in so far as savings may be found possible on the original estimates. We understand that in the absence of any new decision of policy the liability for 1932 and subsequent years is likely to reach the limit of  1,000,000.346. On reviewing the schemes which have so far been assisted we find that in a fair number of them the element of benefit to the trade and industry of this country which is an essential condition of advances under the Act, is somewhat remote.   Under existing
financial conditions this country cannot afford to adopt a policy of mere subsidy by relieving the local government of its obliga-tion to provide a decent and reasonable standard of administration in the matter of public health, housing, transport, etc., nor yet a policy of developments which will bring no appreciable benefit to this country for a long time ahead. We recommend that the grant to the Fund be limited to  750,000 p.a. in future and that the schemes to be aided therefrom should be those that will give the greatest and speediest benefit to this country in the near future. This will effect a saving of  250,000 per annum.12. COLONIAL AND MIDDLE EASTERN SERVICES.347. The services provided for in this Vote fall into two main groups.T. Grants for Colonial Services.1.

We have included this Vote in the present chapter because it should in our opinion be looked at primarily from the point of view of development though we recognise that as regards Middle Eastern Services the dominant consideration at the moment is Empire Defence. There has at times in the past been a tendency to call on the British tax-payer to help other parts of the Empire in their difficulties irrespective of any return to this country. Now this country itself is facing serious difficulties and we feel that a much stronger case is required to justify subsidies.349. We are informed that the economic position of British Guiana and of the West Indian Islands now in receipt of grants is being examined locally by financial Missions. A similar Mission has lately visited Palestine and all opportunities for local economies are being explored in Somaliland and Aden. Pending receipt of the reports of these various enquiries we make no recommehda-tion in respect of these grants beyond stressing the need of this country for the maximum possible relief from its burdens. As regards Cyprus and St. Helena we are satisfied that no reduction of the present subsidy is practicable. It is hoped that the finan-cial position of Nyasaland will have improved sufficiently by 1934 to permit of a reconsideration of present arrangements. Our liabilities in the Middle East as already stated-are dominated by considerations of Empire defence. Some reduction may be expected in Iraq when she is admitted to the League of Nations and the recent treaty with this country comes into force.350. The expenditure falling on the British taxpayer in the past has been enormous and we trust that no further engagements will be entered into involving this country in additional financial com-commitments in the Middle East.351. The world depression naturally bears with particular severity on colonies which depend mainly on primary products and have not been able to build up reserves large enough to carry them through a long crisis; and we are concerned lest it should be found necessary to ask the British Exchequer to come to the rescue of contribution by Palestine Government towards De-fence      ......... 55,000Contribution of India to-wards   expenditure   in aden     ......... 13,500Other receipts in Aden ... 12,770
other administrations besides those already in receipt of assistance from this vote. We are glad to learn that the Colonial Office are keeping in close touch with the Treasury in all cases where there might be a risk of this happening if the depression should continue; and we feel sure that in such cases the responsible authorities will not hesitate to take all possible steps to economize before it is too late.13. UNEMPLOYMENT GRANTS COMMITTEE.352. The Unemployment Grants Committee was originally appointed by Treasury Minute of 20th December, 1920, to make grants towards works of public utility carried out by local authorities other than road and housing schemes. The Committee were to select the schemes to be assisted and the amount of help to be given within a maximum of 30 per cent, of the wages of additional men taken on for the work and a total limit of grant of  3,000,000. In January, 1921, the maximum rate of grant was raised to 60 per cent, of wages and the Committee were allowed to assist roads not receiving grants from the Road Fund.In October, 1921, the Committee was invited to undertake the administration of a new scheme for the relief of unemployment. Financial assistance was to be given by the State to authorities putting in hand or accelerating works of public utility for the relief of unemployment on the following basis : -(a) In the case of non-revenue producing works, grants equivalent to 65 per cent, of the interest and sinking fund chai-ges on loans raised to meet expenditure on approved schemes for a period of half the term of the loan, subject to a maximum period of 15 years&apos; grant.(b) In the case of revenue producing works, grants equivalent to 50 per cent, of the interest for five years on loans raised to meet expenditure on approved schemes.Both categories of grants were conditional on the work com-mencing before the 1st January, 1922, and being completed before the 31st March, 1923.An additional condition was attached to these further schemes under which a reduced rate of wage of 75 per cent, of the Local Authority&apos;s rate for unskilled labour should be paid to unskilled men where the Local Authority carried out the work by direct labour.The previous scheme of grants of 60 per cent, of wages was continued for works financed out of revenue.Since October, 1922, these conditions of grant and both time and money limits have been revised on many occasions and almost
6every revision has resulted in their being made more generous. In December, 1925, in connection with the review of expenditure then being made by a Cabinet Committee it was decided to limit the scheme to areas with heavy unemployment and to exclude all roads from the purview of the Committee, but in January, 1929, these limits were again removed in an attempt to effect the trans-ference of surplus labour from the depressed areas.353. It is unnecessary for us to set out all the changes in rates and conditions of grant that have taken place in the past 10 years. The story is one of recurrent pressure from the central government on local authorities to put in hand works of a capital character with offers of ever increasing grants and easier conditions. The present rates of grant are as follows : A. Schemes of Work Financed by Way of Loan.Non-Revenue producing Schemes.Seventy-five per cent, of the interest and sinking fund charges on any loan raised to meet approved expenditure for the first half (up to 15 years) of the loan period, and 37J per cent, of interest and sinking fund charges for the remainder (up to 15 years) of the loan period.Revenue Producing Schemes.(i) Normal Grant.Fifty per cent, of the interest on any loan raised to meet approved expenditure for 15 years or for the period of the loan, whichever is the shorter, or, if the Authority prefez-s, 100 per cent, of the interest for five years or for one-third of the period of the loan whichever is the shorter.(ii) Special Grants for Works exceeding  100,000 and requiring more than 18 months.One hundred per cent, of the interest during construction on any loans raised as required to meet approved expenditure, and 50 per cent, of the interest after that date for the remainder of a period not exceeding 15 years in all in respect of each loan.(iii) Special Grants for selected schemes for Rural Water Supply, Public Baths, dec.One hundred per cent, of the interest for the first seven years of the period of the loan and 50 per cent, of the interest for the remainder of the period or eight years whichever is the shorter.
B. Schemes of Work financed otherwise than by way of Loan.(i) In areas where the average monthly rate of unemployment among adult males during the 12 months ended 31st March, 1931, exceeded 15 per cent., 90 per cent, of the wages of the unemployed men taken on for the work.(ii) In other areas, the rate of grant will be 75 per cent, of the wages of the unemployed men taken on for the work.354. The total estimated cost of the schemes approved by the Commitee since 1920 now amounts to  187,000,000. In many cases the State liability for grant has already been discharged in whole or in pai-t either by payment of a lump sum or by the annual con-tribution to loan charges. At 30th June, 1931, the estimated capital value of the State liabilities was nearly  40,000,000 for schemes charged on the Relief of Unemployment Vote in addition to about  5,000,000 for road schemes transferred to the Road Fund. The annual payment now being made in respect of the former by the Ministry of Labour is  3,000,000 and that from the Road Fund,  740,000. The Ministry of Labour charge in respect only of schemes approved up to 31st March, 1931, is estimated to increase to  3,690,000 in 1932,  3,890,000 in 1933,  3,850,000 in 1934,  3,880,000 in 1935,  3,870,000 in 1936; and then gradually to decline to  2,690,000 in 1940,  1,600,000 in 1945,  640,000 in 1950,  370,000 in 1960.But these figures take no account of any liabilities incurred since last March. At 31st March the Unemployment Grants Committee had 1,014 schemes to the estimated value of about  16,000,000 under consideration and local authorities had just been invited to submit further schemes to be put in hand next winter. Since 31st Mar-ch 464 schemes at an estimated cost of roughly  7,000,000 have been approved and 996 schemes estimated to cost some  16,000,000 are now under consideration.355. The circular of March last expressed the desire of the Gov-ernment &quot; that there shall be no departure from the present policy that the works shall be fully justified on grounds of public utility and economic development apart from their value as relief works and shall show substantial acceleration.&quot; To take first the latter stipulation of substantial acceleration we cannot but reach the conclusion that after 10 years of working this scheme has largely resolved itself into giving grants now of large amount to local authorities and others to carry out their normal responsibilities. If works appropriate to 1933 are carried out in 1931, those appro-priate to 1934 in 1932 and so on, the whole scheme becomes a mere grant in aid of capital expenditure by local authorities without many of the limitations usually attached to Government grants.356. How far the works are justifiable on grounds of public utility and economic development apart from the value of relief works is a difficult question to answer.   We append a statement as to the
nature of the schemes approved between 1st June, 1929, and 31st March, 1931 :-Class of Scheme.	No.	Amount.	Approximate Present Value of Exchequer Grant.

The total for electricity schemes was exceptionally increased by two schemes of the Ceiitral Electricity Board for the standardisation-tion of frequency ( 9,000,000) and the extension of the &quot; Grid &quot; ( 1,000,000) in the North East coast area. Apart from these two schemes one half of the whole is in respect of sewerage and road schemes. The value of this expenditure depends on the date at which the new works will be needed, but looking at the large amount of similar expenditure in previous years and the fact, that a State grant wforth over 60 per cent, of the capital cost had to be offered before these schemes came forward, we are inclined to regard much of the expenditure as unwise in that it has been incurred consider-ably in advance of requirements. Many of the other items in the table clearly represent amenity developments and the fact that they also have not been put forward earlier suggests that they do not rank very high as amenities.358. We cannot endorse a policy of great expenditure on capital works, irrespective of their economic value, as a means of providing work. It is too expensive. On the usual calculation of 4,000* man years of labour, direct or indirect for  1,000,000 expenditure it costs  250 to keep a man in work for one year. The saving on maintenance of the man is usually put at about  60 a year. Thus, proceeding on this basis, unless the man&apos;s work is worth at least
 190 to the nation when it is done, the nation loses economically by carrying it out.How is compliance with this condition to be secured? It is difficult for the Unemployment Grants Committee even with the aid of Government Departments to select suitable schemes for assistance. If waste it to be avoided the authorities directly con-cerned should themselves weigh up the merits of a scheme against its total cost and in order to secure this effectively the. Government grant should not exceed the saving in the cost of maintenance of the men who find work directly or indirectly under the scheme. This may be interpreted in practice as limiting the Government grant in each case to not more than 25 per cent, of the cost and we recom-mend that this course be adopted as regards all schemes to which the Government has not already definitely promised grants on a more generous basis. As far as is practicable the grant in respect of revenue producing undertakings even within this limit, should not be allowed to exceed the extra cost to the undertaking of putting capital works in hand in advance of the normal date.359. &quot;We recommend also that the Committee in future should not make grants towards road and bridge improvements. These are the concern of the Ministry of Transport and it is un-desirable to have two Departments making grants for the same purpose.14. DEVELOPMENT  (PUBLIC UTILITY)  ADVISORY COMMITTEE.360. This Committee was constituted in 1929 under Part I of the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act, 1929. Part II of the same Act gave statutory recognition to the Unem-ployment Grants Committee (referred to in the preceding section). The latter Committee had been able since 1923 to make grants to Public Utility Undertakings carrying on the same class of work as local authorities subject to certain conditions as to limitation of dividends during the time that loans or advances from the Govern-ment were in operation. Under the Act of 1929 the responsi-bility for recommending grants to Public Utility Undertakings carried on for profit was assigned to a new Committee appointed by the Treasury.361. Assistance under Part I of the Act may take one of two forms, viz. : (i) Guarantees may be given in respect of the principle and/or interest of loans raised and applied for the purpose of meeting capital expenditure on the schemes eligible. Any payments that may have to be made in fulfilment of such guarantees will be met from the Consolidated Pund.(ii) The interest on such loans may be defrayed in whole or in part for a period not exceeding 15 years; in cases whei-e the
633capital expenditure is met from revenue or accumulated funds assistance may be granted as if a loan had. been raised at such rate of interest as the Treasury may determine. 362. Instructions were issued for the guidance of the Advisory Committee by Treasury Minute of 11th September, 1929, (published in the Appendix to Command Paper 3449 of 1929).   The main purport of these instructions is that assistance is only to be given to schemes that would not otherwise be undertaken in the near future and that regard is to be had to the value of the schemes as economic development  as well as to their employment value. Provisions are also included with regard to the use of British materials on assisted schemes and regulations with regard to the labour engaged.363. The following table shows the schemes approved for grant on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee up to the 30th June, 1931. The interest grants are at varying rates not exceed-ing 5 per cent, and for various periods not exceeding 15 years. There is no uniform scale of grants : such grant is recommended as appears appropriate for each work, regard being paid to the esti-mated additional net charge on the undertaking involved in the acceleration of the scheme. Column 3 gives the present value of these grants, and column 4 states the percentage of the estimated total cost of the scheme represented by the present value of the grants.Position as at 30th June, 1931, in respect of &quot; Grant Schemes &quot;.

The total estimated cost of the electricity schemes approved under Part 1 of the Act is therefore  936,931 and the total for schemes of all classes  35,361.302.
364. It will be observed that except in the case of Water Schemes the grants recommended by the Committee have not on the average exceeded the proportion of 25 per cent, we have recommended as the level for the Committee operating under Part IT of the Act. We recommend that that limit should apply also to each scheme assisted toy this Committee. It is already the practice of the Committee to have regard to the extra cost falling upon an undertaking by reason of its proceeding with a scheme in advance of the normal date and we recommend that in this case also that limit to the grant be strictly applied as far as is practicable.chapter vi.SOCIAL SERVICES.365. The general review given in our opening chapter of the in-crease of Government expenditure since 1924 showed that of the total increases on various heads likely to reach about  130,000,000 this year, about  80,000,000 could be ascribed to developments of social services, including both those administered by the Govern-ment and those under the direct control of local authorities. As re-gards the latter class, the State contribution represents only a part of the cost and for a complete picture it would be necessary to look also at the accounts of local authorities. Indeed, as regards some social services a large part is played also by private effort.But even if we restrict our attention to public charges we are met with the difficulty of demarcation. No clear definition of the category of social services has ever been laid down and we doubt whether it is possible in this matter to do more than give compara-tive costs of selected services as has in fact been done for some years past in the Annual Parliamentary Return headed &quot; Public Social Services.&quot;366. That return includes War Pensions, but this service differs so much in origin and character from the general class of social services that we have excluded it from this chapter and deal with it in Chapter VII. Excluding War Pensions, the latest issue of this Return shows that even up to 1929 (or, in a few cases, a previous year) the total cost, so far as it comes within the purview of the Government or of local authorities, of the leading social

These figures relate to the total cost of the services as far as t is known : it is instructive to see to what extent that cost was met (1) by the Exchequer  (2) by local rates and (3) by other receipts e.g.   insurance contributions mainly by the beneficiaries or their employers, rents, fees, endowments, etc., respectively in 1911 and services had increased  as  follows from  1911.

368. Thus between 1911 and 1929 the total cost of these services grew to more than five times its former figure, the charge on rates was trebled, and the charge on the Exchequer was multiplied four and a half times. It is, however, satisfactory to note how very great has been the extension in this period of the policy of requiring contributions towards the cost of social services from those who benefit from them, directly or indirectly.Since 1929 there has been a further increase of roughly  70,000,000 in the gross cost of unemployment insurance and a steady growth of most of the other items in the table, and it is roughly correct to say that the above services in the current year are costing the country in one form or another about seven times what they cost in 1911. An increase of this charge on the country&apos;s productive capacity would have been a serious matter, notwith-standing the change in the value of money, had our trade continued to develop as in the years immediately prior to the war. Under the difficult conditions of the post war period, the increase of burden has been a grave handicap, and we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the enormous increase in the Exchequer charge for these services has been the prime cause of the present crisis in the national finances.369. Had it been possible to make sufficient reductions in other fields of expenditure we would gladly have been content with com-paratively minor adjustments in this field. No such alternative is open and we cannot escape the conclusion that, under existing con-ditions and bearing in mind the rapid downward tendency in the price level with its inevitable reactions on the cost of living and wages, the rapid growth of this expenditure should be stopped and a large reduction made in the existing charge on the Exchequer.I. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.370. The whole question of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme is at present being considered separately by a Royal Corn-mission. Nevertheless, we have felt bound to include the financial aspects of the matter within the scope of our enquiry in view of their outstanding importance to the National Exchequer. That Commission has recently issued an interim report setting out the main financial features of the present scheme and dealing with the more urgent appects of their enquiry.371. Under existing conditions, the cost of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme in 1932 is estimated (on the basis of a live register of 2,500,000) at  119,000,000, made up as follows :- Insurance Scheme   .........      ...      84,000,000Transitional Benefit Scheme ......      35,000,000Total   ...   119,000,000
372. We are in entire agreement with the majority of the Coin-mission that &apos;&apos; borrowing on behalf of the Fund should as nearly as possible cease and that the liabilities, as such, should be restricted to those which can substantially be met from its current income,&quot; and we agree also that for this purpose an average level of un-employment of 2,500,000 may be assumed. We have already indicated in the earlier part of this report our considered opinion that it would be unwise for this country to count on any substan-tial improvement in its financial and economic position for some time to come.373. The Commission recommend alterations in the existing scheme which on the basis of a live register of 2,500,000 are esti-mated to have the following financial effect : The Insurance Scheme (excluding transitional benefit).Financial effect. &apos; 1. Increase of contributions (in the case of men* to 9d. a week for the man, employer and the Exchequer) ...2. Seduction of benefits by 11.7 per cent, on the average3.

Limitation of benefit to 26 weeks in a period of12 months, representing an estimated saving of15 per cent.Thus reducing the deficit in a full year from to     ...............Transitional BenefitEstimated cost for a full yearAddition, due to 26 weeks&apos; limit, (4) above5.

To avoid complication reference is made only to the men&apos;s rate in this report.
374. On this basis while the estimated rate of borrowing is re-duced from  39,450,000 per annum to  7,650,000 per annum, the direct Exchequer charge given in the original estimates for 1931 as  45,000,000 is increased to:- Contribution to Insurance benefit   ...       ...   18,000,000Cost of transitional benefit    .........   34,000,000Total............ 52,000,000375. We approach this question from a somewhat different angle from the Royal Commission and in the course of our inquiry we have probably obtained a fuller appreciation of the grave difficulties con-fronting the Exchequer. After giving full consideration to the views of the Commission we regret that we cannot regard their recommendations as adequate to meet the situation. In our view a large reduction in the present Exchequer charge, as well as the practical elimination of borrowing for this service, are essential, and looking at the matter in the light of our other recommendations we are of opinion that these objects might reasonably be achieved on some such lines as the following. We .give these general in-dications of our views in order to show that we are fully alive to the seriousness of the issues involved, and to the extent of the sacrifices that are necessary to achieve the object we have in view. Their elaboration into a proper scheme would necessarily involve us in detailed investigations which the Royal Commission is far better able to undertake.The Insurance Scheme.376. The estimated cost of the Insurance Scheme proper in 1932-3 is made up as follows :  Benefit............ 74,500,000Administration ............        5,000,000Interest on debt      ............        4,500,000 84,000,000Towards this expenditure of  84,000,000 and the further payments amounting to  35,000,000 under the transitional benefit scheme the beneficiaries are at present contributing at the rate of about
 14,000,000 per annum or only 12 per cent. Under the recom-mendations of the Commission the expenditure on the Insurance Scheme is reduced to  61,200,000, and the income is increased to  53,550,000.377. While we concur in the proposed limit of 26 weeks on benefit, we have come reluctantly to the conclusion that on each of the other heads further action is necessary. Dealing first with ex-penditure, it is not generally realised how greatly the benefits under the scheme have improved in recent years. The original rate under the Act of 1911 was 7s. a week for men and women alike and on the extension of the scheme in 1920 this was increased to 15s. for men and 12s. for women. No special provision was at that time made for dependents. In November, 1921, when dependents were first admitted to benefit, the total benefit for a family of four (man, wife and two children) was raised to 22s. a week. In 1925 it was raised to 27s.; in 1928 to 28s. and in March, 1930, to 30s. The present equivalent in purchasing power (on the basis of the Ministry of Labour index of the cost of living) of the rates of benefit paid in previous years is shown in the follow-ing table :  Year in which, rates have been fixed.	Actual rate of benefit then fixed.	Rate of benefit now re-quired to give ths same purchasing power.	b.   d.	s.   d.1911         .........	7   0	10   61920	15   0	8 101922         .........	22   0	14   41925         .........	27   0	22   71928         .........	28   0	24 101930         .........	30   0	27 11Thus a rate of benefit of 14s. 4d. a week at the present time would have the same purchasing power in terms of commodities as the benefit of 22s. a week actually paid in 1922.In the light of these figures we do not regard an average reduc-tion, during the continuance of existing conditions, of 20 per cent., i.e., for the above typical case from 30s. to 24s. a week, as excessive.On this basis the benefit would be worth more than the benefit deemed suitable in 1925 and only lOd. a week less than that paid as recently as 1928.378. The adjustment of benefit conditions raises many intricate questions which it is not necessary for present purposes for us to pursue beyond saying that a reduction of 10 per cent, might be made by the application of special provisions to classes of beneficiaries who are at present making unfair demands upon the Fund.
Insurance Scheme would be as follows :-Cost of benefit on existing basis Eeduction of 20 per cent, in the average rate of benefitEeduction of 10 per cent, by new regulations as to beneficiariesLimitation of benefit to 26 weeks (15 per cent.)   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...Interest on debt Administration (say) 74,500,000 14,900,000 59,600,0006,000,000 53,600,0008,000,00045,600,000 4,500,000 4,500,000Total expenditure on Insurance Scheme   ...  54,600,000Before discussing the method of meeting &quot;this expenditure it will be convenient to deal with the scheme of transitional benefit.Transitional Benefit Scheme.380. The Royal Commission submit interim recommendations in regard to this scheme which have the effect of bringing the cost (which would be increased from  35,000,000 to  44,100,000 by the operation of the 26 weeks limit in benefit) down to  34,000,000. These recommendations include the introduction of a condition as to need in regard to certain special categories. We are, however, of the opinion that this condition should apply to all applicants for benefit who have exhausted their insurance rights.381. Government Departments have not the machinery for in-quiring into personal circumstances and to set up special machinery for this purpose would be a wasteful duplication of the reconstructed machinery now operating under the County and County Borough Councils as Public Assistance Authorities. At the same time we recognise the strength of the feeling against any immediate out-ward and visible differentiation against those who have fallen out of insurance. Subject to the assessment of need by the public assistance authority we suggest that it might be possible, in the case of an intermediate class of persons who are still suitable for employment to arrange for any necessary allowances to be paid by the Employment Exchanges as agents for the local authority.382. A considerable measure of State assistance to local authori-ties would at the same time be needed if an oppressive increase of burden is not to fall on the rates in many areas.   Under existing
arrangements local authorities have received an extensive relief, not contemplated when the great increase of Exchequer contributions to local authorities was granted under the Local Government Acts of 1929, and in areas with very light unemployment we see no need for attaching any State grant to the arrangements now suggested. But assistance on a scale rapidly rising with the degree of local unemployment will be necessary in other areas and we suggest that in order to leave financial responsibility with the local auhorities it should take the form of a capitation grant for persons transferred to the public assistance authorities, to be continued for such period as they are qualified to remain in the intermediate class.   The capitation payment might be on a scale which had due regard to the percentage of persons in this category to the local population. We consider that these grants to the local authorities should be charged on the Insurance Fund and that the whole cost of main-taining the fund in solvency should be borne in equal shares by the employer, the employed and the Exchequer.   This arrangement, while providing an equitable division of the burden, would serve incidentally to maintain some further connection for persons in this intermediate grade with the Insurance  Scheme.   On the best information we have been able to obtain, the imposition of a needs test under efficient local administration would probably reduce the cost of benefit to the present transitional benefit class to approxi-mately one-half the present cost.   On this basis it would be reason-able to fix the scale of capitation payments to the local authorities to cost about  12,000,000, thus bringing the total cost of both schemes up to  66,600,000.  Dividing this among the three parties would involve a weekly contribution (in the case of men) of lid. -Bach by the State, the employer and the employed person.The Extension of the Scheme. 383. While we entertain no doubt that in the present difficult world conditions an increase of contributions even to this extent would be less damaging to the national interests, considered as a whole, than an increase of general taxation, we are anxious if possible not to raise contributions above lOd. which was the amount paid by employers prior to 1925.   Two alternatives are open :  (1) to allow borrowing ; (2) to extend the area of contribution. 384. Contributions on the lOd. scale for all three parties would produce roughly  60,000,000 leaving some  6,000,000 or  7,000,000 to be borrowed with the live register as high as 2,500,000.   We should prefer to reserve any borrowing against the contingency of unemployment rising above this level for any considerable period, and we turn therefore to the possibility of strengthening the scheme by bringing within it a wider field of steady employment hitherto excluded.
3s6. There are three directions in which extension is possible to the advantage of the Fund : &apos;(a) by bringing back within the ordinary operation of the scheme the Banking industry and the Insurance industry which were allowed to contract out of the main scheme under special schemes made under section 18 of the Unemployment Insurance Act 1920. This power to make special schemes was suspended in 1924 and abolished in 1927 without prejudice,, however, to the position of those w&apos;ho had previously con-tracted out of the main scheme;(b) by bringing within the scheme certain classes of workers who have hitherto been specially excepted as not being subject in any serious degree to the risk of unemployment, e.g., State and municipal workers (including school teachers), employees, of public utility companies, especially the railways;(c) by raising the income limit for the inclusion of non-manual workers from  250 per annum to say  350 or  400-per annum.The main ground for the inclusion of persons in the first two categories is that they are themselves largely immune from the risks-of unemployment and should come to the help of their less fortunate fellows. The same argument would normally apply also to persons-in receipt of an income above the present limit, for non-manual workers, of  250 per annum. We must not, however, lose sight, of the fact that one-third of the whole cost of the scheme is being borne by the Exchequer and that the main ground of principle for this charge is that it brings to the assistance of workers who are subject to unemployment a large measure of assistance far larger than would be represented by weekly contributions at the flat rate  from the more fortunately placed body of direct taxpayers. The average married man does not, however, make any appreciable con-tribution to direct taxation until his income reaches  350 or  400-per annum, and it would not be unreasonable that the exemption limit should be raised to this figure. There appears to us, there-fore, to be a good prima facie case for bringing within the ordinary scheme all the three classes of persons referred to above.386. There is little information on which to base any sort of esti-mate of the effect of such extensions and we give figures with all reserve. Such information as there is leads us ito think that contributions by the State, employer, and employed at the rate of lOd. would produce about  7,500,000 per annum while the cost of benefits and administration might be put at  1,500,000 to- 2,000,000.   On this basis the total expenditure of our combiuedscheme would be raised to, say.......       ...    68,500,000and   the   total   revenue   with   contributions   lOd.(men) to     ............      .......    67,500,000leaving a deficiency of   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...    1,000,000The Government contribution would be one-third of the total contributions, viz.,  22,500,000.
387. The Exchequer charge for 1932 would thus be reduced:-Total       ...    90,000,000        23,500,000        66,500,000388. We regret very much that it should be necessary at a time like this to increase the burden on industry, even to the limited extent we suggest, but after giving the matter most careful thought we have been unable to find any practicable alternative open to less serious objections. Even as we have presented it, the scheme barely balances on the basis of 2,500,000 unemployed and with the prospect of a material excess over this figure during the next few months, we should be sorry to see the scheme carried on without any strengthening on the revenue side. Yet if the contributions of employers are left unaltered it will be very diffi-cult to increase those of the workers alone, while as regards the Exchequer any excess over the one third tatio, while departing from a basis of division hitherto accepted as fair, would expose the Exchequer to charges which it cannot bear. To leave all the rates of contributions unchanged would reduce our esti-mated revenue by no less than  17,000,000 per annum, and we must dismiss this possibility as fundamentally unsound.389. It is not that we regard the extra 2d. on employers as a serious charge in itself; it represents a very small fraction on the cost of production : it is rather the psychological effect of any addition to existing burdens at this moment. On this point, how-ever, we would make this to our minds very relevant observation. No small part of the present financial difficulties of the Exchequer is to be attributed to the extensive rating relief granted to industry under the Local Government Acts, 1929. That relief is costing the Exchequer  26,000,000 per annum, whereas the additional 2d. a week represents over the whole field of contributions  extended as we suggest only  4,500,000. As the charge of  4,500,000 is spread over a much wider field of employment than the relief of  26,000,000 it is clear that the amount of the extra charge falling on productive industry will be considerably less on the average than one-sixth of the rating relief that it is enjoying. And it should be borne in mind that the rating relief is per-manent, whereas we trust that the increase in unemployment insurance contributions will be temporary.390. We repeat the recommendation in our opening chapter that borrowing for the Unemployment Insurance Scheme should be dis-continued after this year. This means that any deficit on the Scheme (including the cost of transitional benefit) would have to be made good by the Exchequer i.e. until the existing debt of the Fund had been substantially reduced.Budget charge Loan chargefrom  50,000,000 40,000,000to  22,500,000 1,000,000Reduction.  27,500,000 39,000,000
2.-NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE.391. The sums payable to the National Health Insurance Funds from the Exchequer represent mainly the statutory Exchequer pro-portion of the expenditure on medical, sickness disablement, maternity, and additional benefits, and expenses of administration under the National Insurance Acts, this proportion being fixed in the National Health Insurance Acts, 1924-28.The total expenditure in Great Britain in the year 1930 out of National Health Insurance Funds was approximately as follows :- &apos;  Sickness and Disablement Benefits ...       ... 16,800,000Maternity Benefit       ............ 1,750,000Medical Benefit          ............ 10,500,000Additional Non-cash Benefits          ...... 3,000,000 32,050,000Approved   Societies   and   Insurance   Com-mittees Administration expenses ...       ...     4,400,000 36,450,000Of this expenditure  6,370,000 was derived from the Exchequer, representing a grant of l/7th of the expenditure in the case of men and l/5th of the expenditure on women. In addition the cost of central administration to the amount of  1,000,000 was charged on Parliamentary Votes of which only  100,000 was recovered from insurance funds, leaving a further net liability on the Exchequer of  900,000.392. The total expenditure for the years 1921-30 and the portion thereof derived from the Exchequer are shown in the following table : Calendar Year.

(a) The reduction in the rate of ordinary State Grant from 2/9ths of the expenditure to l/7th for men and l/5th for women, under the provisions of the Economy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1926, as from 1st January, 1926.The reduction in the grant on the estimated expenditure for the current year amounts to  2,000,000.(b) The cessation as from 1st April, 1922, of Special Grants to meet the additional cost of medical benefit (including administration) over the amount payable under statute out of benefit funds.Under the 1920 Act a sum of 10s. a year per member was payable out of benefit funds, the remainder (2s. 6d. to 3s. per member) being met by Special Exchequer Grants up to 31st March, 1922. From that date up to 31st December, 1926, the additional cost was met under the provisions of the National Health Insurance Act, 1922, and the National Health Insur-ance (Cost of Medical Benefit) Act, 1924, out of Insurance funds, partly out of benefit funds and partly out of unclaimed contributions and the Investment Account Reserve. Under the Economy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1926, a sum not exceeding 13s. a year per member was made payable out of benefit funds. This reduction in Exchequer grants amounts at present to approximately  2,150,000 a year.(c) The cessation as from 1st January, 1922, of the Special Grant to the Women&apos;s Equalisation Fund.The provisions of the National Health Insurance Act, 1918, under which this Fund was constituted, as a charge on the Exchequer, for the purpose of assisting Approved Societies to meet their liability in respect of the sickness claims of women, were repealed by the National Health Insurance Act, 1922.   The amount provided was  350,000 a year.(d) Since 1921 the Special Grant of  142,000 to the Central Fund has been suspended. This Fund is constituted under Section 68 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1924, its purpose being to make good deficiencies found on the valuation of Approved Societies which cannot be made good from the Society&apos;s Contingencies Fund. The proviso to Section 68 (1) provides that the grant shall be reduced proportionately with any reduction in the levy out of contributions. The levy has been wholly suspended since 1921, but owing to the increase in claims on the Fund it may have to be re-imposed in the near future.394. The course of health insurance finance for the five years ending 31st December, 1929, is summarised in the following table of the receipts and payments for all Approved Societies in Great Britain, as well as Deposit Contributors, members of the Navy,
Army and Air Force Insurance Fund and Exempt Persons. Com-plete figures for 1930 are not yet available but we understand that the general results of the year will be similar,to those of 1928.Receipts.	1925.	1926.	1927.	1928.	1929.Contributions...

The rates of contributions were reduced as from January, 1928, on the reduction of the age limit for (sickness and disablement) benefits from 70 to 65, under the Widows&apos;, etc., Pensions Act, 1925.
395. In explanation of these large invested funds we should ex-plain that the Health Insurance Scheme rests on the financial basis of the contributions being appropriate to persons entering insurance at the age of 16. A scheme of this nature when it had reached a normal state of affairs, would necessarily possess large reserve funds representing the excess value of the contributions made by each person in his early years over the benefits received by him. When the scheme began in 1912 these reserves were provided by paper credits in the books of societies and in the 20 years that have elapsed, these credits have in great measure been replaced by cash reserves. We understand that the ultimate figure required for the scheme on its present basis is in the neighbourhood of  140,000,000.396. Quinquennial valuations are made of the assets and liabilities of each Approved Society and where a disposable surplus is revealed the society is able to declare additional benefits. The results of the first two valuations are summarised below and the estimated payments made in respect of additional benefits are shown in the five years summary above.

The third valuations as at 31st December, 1927, 1928 or 1929 of the 7,500 Approved Societies and branches with over 16 million members are now nearing completion. The results thus far showjhat&quot;there is considerable reduction in the disposable surpluses as compared with the previous valuations which must lead to some reduction in the additional benefits payable over the next five years.We understand that certain Societies will need assistance from the Central Fund to enable them to pay the statutory benefits over the next five years.398. This Central Fund, which is a United Kingdom fund, established for this purpose in 1918, stood at 31st December, 1929, at  1,738,000.   It is fed as required by a levy of aboun 3d. a year
per member on approved societies and an Exchequer grant of  142,000 a year, but both ]evy and grant have been suspended since 1921 owing to the size of the balance. With the continuance of heavy unemployment and the heavy sickness benefit claims which have been a feature of the last few years there is, however, con-siderable prospect of this fund needing replenishment at no distant date.399. A considerable measure of assistance towards meeting losses arising from unemployment is also afforded to approved societies by the Unclaimed Contributions Account for Great Britain. To this account is credited the proceeds of sales of stamps which for one reason or another are never submitted to the Department on insurance cards. Under the Insurance Act, 1928, the moneys available on this account are to be applied in credits to approved Societies towards meeting the cost of benefits to members, in arrears owing to unemployment, for a maximum period of about two years and nine months from the termination of employment.400. It was estimated that the balance standing to the credit of the account (together with the yearly accumulation of unclaimed stamps money and interest would enable a sum of  500,000 to be dis-tributed amongst Approved Societies for the next four or five years. Owing to the abnormal rate of unemployment, however, the annual losses incurred by Societies in the excusal of arrears due to unem-ployment are now very largely in excess of the money available.401. A third way in which special provision has been made by Parliament for members suffering from prolonged unemployment is seen in the National Health Insurance (Prolongation of Insurance) Act, 1930. This Act provides for the payment from the Exchequer of 36 contributions for each Approved Society member who would otherwise, by reason of prolonged unemployment, have ceased to be insured during 1931. The estimated cost is  100,000 to  150,000 for the year, but no decision has been arrived at as to the action to be taken after this year.402. We have dealt with the present situation in regard to the Health Insurance Scheme somewhat fully in order to bring out the curious situation which is developing. While the income of the scheme as a whole is just about sufficient to finance a continuance of the present rate of expenditure (including any additional benefits that are being provided out of the surpluses of Societies) not-withstanding the serious loss of contributions from unemployment, the separate financial units comprising the scheme are showing at each valuation increasing disparities. The richer societies are becoming able to increase their additional benefits still more and even in a few cases refund to their members their proportions of the contributions, while those at the other extreme are in increasing danger of being unable to maintain even the statutory rates of benefit.   Such disparities of fortune might perhaps be
defended if it could be shown that they arise from good or bad administration. This element does undoubtedly enter into the matter, but by far the most weighty factors are the differing health and unemployment risks of the members in separate societies.403. We are fully aware that the freedom of insured persons with favourable risks to form their own societies and in time to obtain special advantages for themselves was held out at the inception of the scheme as one of its great attractions and was the answer to complaints of the inequality of charging uniform rates of con-tributions to all persons. This argument, pushed to its logical conclusion, is however destructive of national insurance in any field, and indeed strikes at the basis of all insurance, viz., the pooling of risks. However careful the selection these can never be equal for all participants in the pooling. A small element of pooling as between societies is already present in the working of the Central Fund. There is therefore no new departure of principle involved in a further measure of pooling and as long as it still leaves considerable variations in the rates of benefit offered by societies the expectations held out at the inception of the scheme are sub-stantially met. In our view the present situation demands an ex-tended application of this principle of pooling, sufficient (1) to prevent well administered societies from failing to maintain the statutory rates of benefit and (2) to enable societies to give special treatment to men suffering from prolonged unemployment to the extent provided by the National Health Insurance Act, 1928. These arrangements are so generous that we can see no adequate ground for extension of the Prolongation of Insurance Act beyond this year in so far as it concerns health insurance.404. There are many ways in which this pooling can be effected. One would be by reimposing and increasing the levy for the Central Pund and by using that fund as expended to meet the charges we have in mind. Another would be by a direct levy on the dis-posable surpluses of societies. A discussion of the relative merits of these would take us into intricate details which we are anxious to avoid. Suffice it to say that such pooling as is necessary should in our view be effected without an3&apos; additional charge falling upon the Exchequer.405.. The Exchequer grant of  142,000 to the Central Eund is open to serious objection as going to meet expenditure which will itself attract the normal State proportion. As far as finances of the scheme permit the general policy for the future should be to limit Exchequer assistance rigidly to this proportionate grant, all central administrative expenditure being charged to the scheme. The non-extension of the Prolongation of Insurance Act and the elimination of the grant to the Central Pund removes a contingent liability of about  250,000 per annum.

We have considered whether some reduction might not be made in the expenditure of the scheme as a whole to enable it to meet the cost of central administration now falling on the Ex-chequer to the extent of  900,000 per annum.407. We do not recommend any reduction in the statutory rates of cash benefits :  Sickness benefit 15s. man and 12s. woman. Disablement benefit 7s. 6d. Maternity benefit 40s.408. It is to be noted that no additional allowances are paid in respect of dependents under this scheme. The allowance to approved societies for administrative expenses shows an increase of 32 per cent, over the pre-war figure and the existing arrange -ments as to drugs enable a revision to be made after next year if prices have then fallen.409. We are however of the opinion that the payments to the doctors are too high in present circumstances. These consist of a flat capitation allowance of 9s. per annum for every insured person in a doctor&apos;s list in addition to mileage allowances in rural areas, amounting in the aggregate to  250,000 and equivalent on the average over the whole of the medical panels to about Aid. per insured person. It is common knowledge that the standard of remuneration of the medical profession has been greatly increased as a result of the Health Insurance Scheme and there has been growing difficulty in filling salaried medical posts under the Govern-ment and the local authorities at rates of pay corresponding to those in other classes of public service. In present circum-stances we should not regard a reduction of the capitation rate to 8s. as unreasonable. This would represent a saving to the scheme of about  750,000 and enable it to meet the cost of central administration to this additional amount.410. The total reduction in this field is thus brought up to about  1,000,000.3.-MATERNITY SCHEME.411. In connection with the National Health Insurance Scheme we have had our attention called to a development of the maternity service, at present provided thereunder, which has been under con-sideration for some time. Under the Health Insurance Scheme a sum of  2 is paid on the confinement of an insured woman or the wife of an insured man. In the case of a married woman who is or has recently been herself an employed contributor (some 25 per cent, of the whole) a total sum of  4 is paid.   Out of this provision
she is free to make her own arrangements as regards the attend-ance of doctor or midwife at confinement. Medical benefit under the insurance scheme covers attendance before confinement or not less than 10 days thereafter and sickness benefit may be drawn by an insured woman except for a period of four weeks following confinement.412. The total provision for maternity benefit made from insur-ance funds is about  1,950,000 per annum and the present expendi-ture is about  1,530,000 per annum, thus leaving a margin to approved societies of about  420,000 per annum. Under the new scheme it is proposed to halve the present maternity benefit and to divert half the provision (i.e.  975,000) to an extended maternity service to be provided by the local authorities. This service would cover(1) Provision in every case of the services of a qualified midwife to act either as midwife or maternity nurse;(2) provision in every case of a doctor to give ante-natal, natal and post-natal attention as may prove necessary to all cases showing any abnormahty;(3) provision of a consultant when desired by the doctor in attendance;(4) provision of hospital beds for such cases as need in-stitutional care;(5) provision of certain ancillary services (e.g. transport, sterilised equipment, laboratory facilities).413. The scheme would be operated by county and county borough councils, subject to a power to the county council to delegate all or any part of it, with prior approval of the Minister of Health, to a county district council which is a maternity and child welfare authority. The local authority would be under statutory obiiga-tion to render the above services free to insured persons but would have complete discretion in other cases as to the service to be rendered and as to the charge, if any, to be made therefor.414. The terms of service of doctors and midwives (and possibly also consultants) would be negotiated centrally with representative bodies. Such terms would include provision for securing proper service under appropriate penalty; the contract of service thus arranged to be with the local and not the central authority, as in the case of the National Health Insurance Medical Service contract. A panel of doctors, midwives (and possibly consultants) would be established for each county and county borough area to work the scheme in that area.   A woman would have power to
select doctor and midwife to attend on her, subject to their con-currence.415. We understand that it is contemplated that services (4) and (5) above would, in view of the increase of grants under the Local Government Act, 1929, be provided wholly out of rates and that any receipts from uninsured persons under the scheme generally would be retained by local authorities. The cost of (1) (2) and (3) in excess of the amount diverted from insurance funds would be an Exchequer charge. Pending negotiations with the medical profession, any estimate of the cost of these services is given with reserve, but the total figure is put by the Ministry of Health at about  2,500,000 for Great Britain of which  975,000 would fall on insurance funds leaving about  1,500,000 as the probable Er-chequer charge.416. No one can dispute the desirability of taking action to reduce the serious loss of life and health in connection with maternity and we do not doubt that it would be a definite advantage from this point of view to substitute, in considerable measure, services of attendance for the present cash payment of maternity benefit. At the same time we cannot but regard this scheme as unduly ambitious in scope; it introduces into local government adminis-tration for the first time the very undesirable principle of differen-negotiation between those who belong to the State insurance scheme and those who do not; but most serious of all is the proposed additional charge of  1,500,000 per annum upon the Exchequer. In present financial circumstances, the Exchequer cannot afford to assume this liability and in our view improvement of this service should be sought without any extra State grant.4. OLD AGE PENSIONS AND BLIND PERSONS PENSIONS (NON-CONTRIBUTORY).417. The Old Age Pensions Act, 1908, with effect from the 1st January, 1909, first introduced the scheme of non-contributory old age pensions, the broad principles of which have, with certain modi-fications, remained in force ever since.The grant of a pension was made subject to age, means, nationality and residence tests, and the maximum rate was fixed at 5s. a week if the means did not exceed  21 a year. Lower rates of pension were payable if the means did not exceed  31 10s. a year.418. In view of the increase in the cost of living during the war, an Additional War Allowance of 2s. 6d. a week was added in 1916, and as from 2nd January, 1920, under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1919, this was merged in an increase of the normal rate of pension

For a married couple living together the means of each is assumed to be one half of the total means.4.19. The Old Age Pensions Act, 1924, introduced with effect from the 7th August, 1924, an important alteration in the calculation of means by providing for a deduction not exceeding  39 a year (or  78 a year in the case of a married couple living together), from means other than earnings. This alteration was made in order to meet the plea that the means limit penalised thrift and to discourage old people from competing in the labour market. Thus it is now possible for a married couple to draw the full pensions of 10s. a week each if they have already total means (otherwise than from earnings) amounting to  52 10s. -t-  78 =  130 10s., thus giving them a total income of  182 10s. per annum.420. Apart from the alterations in the old age pension position introduced by the contributory scheme instituted in 1925 (which is dealt with in the following section), the only other important change since the War was the reduction of the age of qualification for blind persons from 70 to 50 years of age under the Blind Persons Act, 1920.The cost of Old Age Pensions since the War.421. The following table shows the costs of old age pensions (in-cluding blind persons pensions) in Great Britain for each year since 1921, together with the expenses of administration. Since 1926 an increasing proportion of- pensioners have established a title under the contributory scheme, and are therefore not subject to the means limit. Separate figures of cost for non-contributory and contribu-tory pensioners over 70 are not available but a rough estimate is given in note (c) below. These figures are, of course, quite different from the extra- cost of old age pensions due to the Contributory Pensions Scheme, i.e., of pensions to persons who would otherwiseYearly Means.

The cost of Blind Pensions, which is included in the above figures as from 10th September, 1920, has risen gradually from approximately  255,000 in 1921-22 to  585,000 in 1930-31.The Future Cost of Old Age Pensions.422. We are advised by the Government Actuary that the problem of estimating with accuracy the future cost of old age pensions isbe disqualified on the ground of means. No part of the cost of pensions over 70 given below is chargeable against contributiona under this scheme :  
rendered especially difficult at the present time by reason of the fact that the population in various age-groups, as now estimated, depends upon the enumerated numbers at the Census of 1921. Pending the issue of the detailed figures for this year&apos;s Census, he estimates that the numbers of persons in Great Britain aged over 70 years in 1930-31, 1935-6 and 1940-1 will toe as follows :-No. of personsDate. over age 70 inGreat Britain.30th September, 1931   .........      1,811,00030th September, 1936   .........      2,031,00030th September, 1941   .........      2,242,000423. The proportion of the population over 70 who have been in receipt of an old age pension in. recent years is shown in the following statement, from which persons receiving &quot; blind &quot; pen-sions have been excluded.Year, (as at 30th June).

The large increase in 1926-27 is due to the Con-tributory Pensions Act of 1925 ; here again a considerable period elapsed before the full number of claims under the Act emerged, and this accounts mainly for the further rise in 1927-28. Precise information is not available as to the number of pensions awarded under the Pensions Act of 1929, but it is thought that approximately one-third of the increase in the proportion of pensioners since July, 1929, may be attributed to this Act.424. While changes in legislation are clearly responsible for cer-tain large and well-marked increases in the proportion of pensioners
they do not appear to account fully for the persistent tendency towards an increase in the proportion which can be observed throughout the period under review. In this connection the progress of the percentages for men and women separately is of interest. Whereas, in 1921, the proportion of men over 70 in receipt of pension was nearly 25 per cent, less than the correspond-ing proportion of women, in 1930 the proportion was practically the same for both sexes. In part this feature is the result of the grant of pensions at 70 by virtue of the provisions of the Con-tributory Pensions Act of 1925, but to some extent also it may probably be attributed to the growing economic stress of the past few years which has presumably made it increasingly difficult for an elderly man to obtain a livelihood.425. Having regard to the position as indicated briefly in the fore-going paragraphs, it was assumed for the purpose of the Parliamen-tary estimates for 1931-2 that the average proportion of pensioners during that year would amount to 80 per cent, (excluding &quot; blind &quot; pensioners). The estimate of  38.2 millions makes provision accordingly. After careful examination of such material as is at present available the Government Actuary thinks it improbable that the proportion of the aged population becoming entitled to old age pensions will reach 85 per cent. He assumes that the saturation point will be reached at 82J per cent, in about five years time.Addition for blind pensioners.426. The addition to be made to the cost of old age pensions to include those payable to blind persons aged between 50 and 70 is a somewhat speculative matter. The number of such persons has grown considerably in recent years, as will be seen from the follow -ing table :  Year. (31st March). (1)	Number of persons in receipt of &quot; blind &quot; pensions in Great Britain. (2)	Column (2) expressed as a percentage of the population over age 70. (3)1921	8,900	0-61927	17,100	1-01929	20,700	1-21931	23,500	1-3427. The marked and continued increase in these numbers may indicate, in some small measure, an increase in industrial blind-ness. It appears mainly, however, to reflect the growth of activity on the part of the local authorities who administer the Blind
Persons Act to 1920 and have, in the last few years, tended to give generous financial and other assistance to blind persons who register themselves. In this connection it is important to note that the statutory definition of blindness for the purpose of the Act, viz. that the person is &quot;so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential &quot; is not altogether satisfactory, and as a result the development of an easy standard in the test for qualification, together with the lack of expert examination in many cases, may bear some responsibility for the increase.On the figures given above it was assumed that the proportion of blind pensioners to the population over age 70 would have grown to 1J per cent, by 1935 and to If per cent, by 1940.Cost of pensions in next decennium.428. On the basis described above, and making suitable adjust-ments for pensions payable at a lower rate than 10s. Od. a week, it is estimated that the number of pensioners and annual cost of pen-sions in the next decennium will be as follows : Average number Annual costFinancial of pensioners of pensions,year. during year.  1931-2       ......      1,478,000 38,200,0001935-6       ......      1,705,000 44,200,0001940-1       ......      1,889,000 49,000,000When submitting estimates in connection with the Widows&apos;, etc., Pensions Bill, 1925, the Government Actuary put the total cost of Old Age Pensions over 70 for the same years at :  1931-2 ...............   36,400,0001935-6 ...............   40,600,0001940-1 ...............   46,300,000so the financial outlook for the scheme has become appreciably more serious in the past six years. But even on the lower level of costs then adopted the total burden was estimated to increase continuously as far as the estimates were carried, i.e., up to 1965-6, for which year the cost was put at  64.4 millions. Other estimates given at the same time showed that the growth of this charge would practically neutralise the large reduction in the War Pension charge over the same period.429. Apart from the action to be taken in connection with the Contributory Pensions Scheme we do not consider that it is prac-ticable at the present time to make any reduction in this liability. As time goes on and more and more pensioners establish a title under the Contributory Scheme, the means limit will become less important.   If any substantial reduction of burden were essential,
it would in our view be necessary to reduce the basic rate of 10s. a week. As far as adjustments in respect of the altered value of money are concerned it is relevant to point out that the present rate is 100 per cent, over the pre-war standard, that it was fixed in 1919 when the cost-of-living index also was about 100 per cent, above the pre-war level, and that the increase in this index has fallen to 45 per cent. We cannot, however, overlook the change in public opinion in regard to such pensions that has occurred since the Scheme started in 1909 and the movement in favour of a more extended scheme of retirement pensions. In our view a reduction of the basic rate of 10s. could now only be effected as part of a general scheme of sacrifice all round.5. WIDOWS&apos;, ORPHANS&apos;, AND OLD AGE CONTRIBUTORY PENSIONS.430. Under the scheme approved by Parliament on the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos;, and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act, 1925, provision was made for(a) pensions for widows and dependent children, and(b) old age pensions commencing at the age of 65 instead of 70 and passing, on the attainment of the age of 70, into pensions under the Old Age Pensions Acts, freed from the restrictions and disqualifications at present applied to such pensions.Subject to the fulfilment of the statutory conditions, which in-volve a minimum period of insurance and the payment of a mini-mum number of contributions by the person on whose insurance a claim to pension under the Act is based, the following are the benefits normally payable :  (a) Widows&apos; Pensions. 10s. a week for the widow of an insured man who dies after the 4th January, 1926, and was under 70 years of age at that date, with an additional allo.w-ance for children up to the age of 14 (or 16 if remaining under full-time instruction in a day school) at the rates of 5s. a week for the eldest such child and 3s. a week for each of the other children.(b) Orphans&apos; Pensions. 7s. 6d. a week for each child of an insured man, being a married man or a widower, or of an insured widow, payable up to the age of 14 (or. 16 if the child remains under full-time instruction in a day school).(c) Old Age Pensions. 10s. a week to insured men and insured women between the ages of 65 and 70, and 10s. a week to the wives between the ages of 65 and 70 of insured men who are themselves entitled to pensions.
167848it would in our view be necessary to reduce the basic rate of 10s. a week. As far as adjustments in respect of the altered value of money are concerned it is relevant to point out that the present rate is 100 per cent, over the pre-war standard, that it was fixed in 1919 when the cost-of-living index also was about 100 per cent, above the pre-war level, and that the increase in this index has fallen to 45 per cent. We cannot, however, overlook the change in public opinion in regard to such pensions that has occurred since the Scheme started in 1909 and the movement in favour of a more extended scheme of retirement pensions. In our view a reduction of the basic rate of 10s. could now only be effected as part of a general scheme of sacrifice all round.5. WIDOWS&apos;, ORPHANS&apos;, AND OLD AGE CONTRIBUTORY PENSIONS.430. Under the scheme approved by Parliament on the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos;, and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act, 1925, provision was made for(a) pensions for widows and dependent children, and(b) old age pensions commencing at the age of 65 instead of 70 and passing, on the attainment of the age of 70, into pensions under the Old Age Pensions Acts, freed from the restrictions and disqualifications at present applied to such pensions.Subject to the fulfilment of the statutory conditions, which in-volve a minimum period of insurance and the payment of a mini-mum number of contributions by the person on whose insurance a claim ito pension under the Act is based, the following are the benefits normally payable :  (a) Widows&apos; Pensions. 10s. a week for the widow of an insured man who dies after the 4th January, 1926, and was under 70 years of age at that date, with an additional allo.w-ance for children up to the age of 14 (or 16 if remaining under full-time instruction in a day school) at the rates of 5s. a week for the eldest such child and 3s. a week for each of the other children.(b) Orphans&apos; Pensions. 7s. 6d. a week for each child of an insured man, being a married man or a widower, or of an insured widow, payable up to the age of 14 (or 16 if the child remains under full-time instruction in a day school).(c) Old Age Pensions. 10s. a week to insured men and insured women between the ages of 65 and 70, and 10s. a week to the wives between the ages of 65 and 70 of insured men who are themselves entitled to pensions.
431. Provision was also made by the Act of 1925, subject to cer-tain conditions, for pensions at the ordinary rate to widows and children of insured men who died before the commencement of the Act. A widow in this class was not, however, eligible for a pension unless there was living at the commencement of the Act at least one child of the marriage, or of a former marriage&apos;of either parent, under the age of 14. Her pension ceased six months after the youngest child attains 14. An orphan&apos;s pension is similarly pay-able to the orphan children while under the age of 14 (or 16 if under full-time instruction in a day school) of an insured man (being a married man or a widower) or an insured widow who died before the commencement of the Act.As from 2nd July, 1926, pensions under the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1924, at the full rate of 10s. a week became payable by virtue of the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act to insured persons on attaining 70, without the application of the means test. The same rights were given to the wives of insured men.432. The scheme is on a contributory and compulsory basis and is interlocked with the scheme of health insurance, combined con-tributions being made, as a rule, towards both on the same insurance card. The relation of the contributions to the benefits is based upon the principle by which the contributions have been determined in the case of National Health Insurance, viz., that the contributions are equal in value (as actuarially ascertained) to the benefits granted to persons entering into insurance at the age of 16, special arrangements being made by which, in effect, the State provides for the extra liability, over and above the pro-vision made by the contributions, arising in respect of persons entering into insurance at all ages between 17 and 70. In apply-ing this principle to the present case regard has been had to two considerations peculiar to a scheme of this kind, namely, (i) that the major part of the benefits consists of pensions for widows and allowances for children, and (ii) that the wife of an insured man will be entitled, equally with himself, to a pension when both have reached the age of 65. Insured women (who for the most part are young and unmarried) are therefore required to contribute to the scheme on a wider basis than is represented by the slight probability that they will themselves continue in insurance to the age of 65 and then become entitled to a pension in their own right, their weekly contribution being fixed at one-half of the rate pay-able for insured men. The effect is that during the period of their employment women (with their employers) will make a contribu-tion towards the benefits to which they will be entitled either in their own right or as the wives and widows of insured men.433. On this basis the appropriate weekly contributions from the age of 16 for the benefits granted by the Act up to age 70 were lOd.
for a man and 5d. for a woman. The initial rates were fixed at 9d. and 4 d., respectively, equally divided between employees and employed, but having regard to the unconditional right to old age pensions after 70 conferred by the Aot, it was provided that from 1936, 1946 and 1956 the rate contributions should be increased by 2d. (Id. for women) on each occasion thus bringing the total eventually to Is. 3d. representing the full equivalent, in the case of the person entering at 16, of all the benefits of the Act.434. As already stated the excess cost of the benefits for entrants over 16 was accepted as a liability on the Exchequer, which had in addition to meet the extra coat of the rights granted to volun-tary contributors over and above their contributions, the cost of granting pensions without any contributions to existing widows and children and the extended rights granted to Old Age Pen-sioners at 70. The capital value of the liability so assumed by the Exchequer was summarised by the Government Actuary as follows :  For employed persons entering compulsory insurance when over 16 years of age      566,000,000For Voluntary Contributors       ......        12,000,000For Widowed Mothers and Children    ...        42,000,000For extended rights to Old Age Pensionsat 70        ...............      126,000,000&apos;Total............     746,000,000435. Contrary to the principle adopted under the Health Insur-ance Scheme, no provision has been made in this scheme for build-ing up reserve funds which would in time represent the accumulated surplus of contributions by persons entering at 16 years of age. From the outset contributions have been applied as received to defray current expenditure. The actual net charge falling upon the Exchequer in any year, over and above contributions received, is therefore a gradually rising figure and for the first decennium was estimated to average only  4,000,000 per annum. The Ex-chequer grant was accordingly fixed at this figure by the Act of 1925 up to 31st March, 1936.436. In 1929 a new Act was passed extending the scheme to include : (a) pensions to widows over the age of 55 of men of the insurable class who died before the 4th January, 1926, and to widows of men who, though they survived the 4th January, 1926, were then over 70;
(b) prolongation of right to widows&apos; pensions under the 1925 Aot, until the youngest child attains the age of 16 in the case where the husband died before 4th January, 1926;(c) Old Age Pensions to the wives between the ages of 65 and 70 of men who were over 70 on 2nd January, 1928, and were entitled to old age pension under the Old Age Pen-sions Acts, 1908 to 1924, and to widows over 70 who, had they been under 70, would have been qualified for widows&apos; pension.437. The total cost of these concessions (of which (a) was by far the most expensive) in the period to 31st March, 1936, was esti-mated at  47,300,000, averaging about  8,000,000 per annum. For the next decennium the extra charge was  5,000,000 per annum, falling gradually thereafter to a minimum of  600,000 per annum. As contributions were unaltered this necessitated an increased Exchequer grant and in order to provide this and also to smooth out the sudden increase that was ito have taken place under the original scheme in 1936, the new Act fixed the charge at  9,000,000 for 1930-31 rising by  1,000,000 per annum to a maximum of  21,000,000 in 1942-3. This relates to the expendi-ture charged on the Treasury Pensions Account and does not in elude the additional cost of Old Age Pensions over 70 resulting from the Contributory Pensions Acts. The following table gives the estimated revenue and expenditure of the scheme up to 1946. As far as can be foreseen the liability after 1946 is not considered likely to rise above the sum of  21,000,000 per annum.						Balance in financial Year.	Receipts from Contribu-	Interest.

We are advised that the bulk of the excess of  680,000 in the contribution income for 1929-30 was due to the fact that the growth in the insured population during the latter half of 1928-29 and during 1929-30 was greater than anticipated. A relatively small part of the excess is to be accounted for by an improvement in the sickness experience which resulted in a smaller loss of contributions. As regards 1930-31 the contribution income cannot be considered in relation to the insured population, figures for the latter being not yet available. It is clear, however, that the excess in the contribution income which would otherwise have occurred in that year as a result of the abnormal increase in in-sured population in the preceding period was more than counter-balanced by the rapid growth in the rate of unemployment.440. It is not possible to state with any authority the manner in which the above mentioned increase in the number of insured persons has affected the age and sex distributions of the popula-tion. There are grounds however for thinking that the increase has arisen as a result of a diminution in the number of persons leaving insurance rather than an increase in the number of new entrants. Bach such additional person remaining in insurance represents a liability for benefits which  will, in due course,
probably exceed the additional amount of contributions paid on his account in the future. The excess income derived from this source cannot, therefore, pending further information, be regarded as a surplus available for disposal.441. The diminution in the contribution income which occurred in 1930-31 as a result of the rise in the rate of unemployment must be regarded as an irrecoverable loss. During that year the average rate of unemployment among persons insured against unemploy-ment was about IS per cent. The present rate is nearly 21 per cent, and it is thus to be feared that unless a rapid recovery occurs in the economic position of the country the loss of contributions due to this cause in 1931-32 will exceed that of the preceding year.442. The difference between the actual and estimated costs of age 65-70 pensions appears to be due to two causes. First, it was necessary, in the absence of knowledge of the effects of the new conditions regarding termination of insurance introduced by the Pensions Act of 1925 and the Insurance Act of 1928, to make assumptions regarding the proportions of the population which would be qualified for pension in future years. So far, only two-thirds of the increase allowed for in this respect has materialised. The non-emergence of the remaining third accounts for about  750,000 of the difference which arose in each of the two years. Secondly, the Pensions Act of 1929 relaxed the conditions as to the contributions test in the case of certain persons. On the basis of an examination by the Ministry of Health of the rejected applications in their possession provision was made for 20,000 awards under this head, of which some 90 per cent, consisted of age 65-70 pensions. So far the bulk of these additional cases do not appear to have emerged. It is estimated that the non-emergence of this class accounted for about  100,000 of the differ-ence in 1929-30 (quarter year&apos;s charge) and about  400,000 in 1930-31.443. While it is clear that the two causes mentioned above have so far resulted in a surplus of some  2,000,000 in the Pensions Accounts, it would not be justifiable to assume, on the experience off the two years&apos; working of the new benefits, that surplus of this dimension will emerge in future years. In the first place the relaxation of the contributions test covered a diminishing class since, at the outset, provision was necessary for the whole of the class concerned then aged between 65 and 70. In fact, the amount provided up to the 31st March, 1936, amounted only to  2,100,000 in total and thereafter to a relatively small annual sum. Further, experience shows that there is usually a consider-able lag in applications for a new or an extended benefit, pre-sumably due to the slow appreciation of the position on the part of the insured persons concerned.   Thus it may well be that the
proportion of claims in respect of both of the classes referred to in paragraph 442 will yet show a substantial increase.444. The foregoing considerations suggest that, at the moment, the Pensions Account appears to be suffering a loss of contribution income of at least  1,000,000 per annum as a result of the present heavy unemployment and that this loss is approximately counter-balanced by the surplus provision made for the two classes of age 65-70 pensioners referred to above. The excess of  2,400,000 in the balance in the Pensions Accounts as at 31st March, 1931, probably does contain a surplus, but it is thought that its amount is not in excess of  1,000,000 and this sum is at present not being added to. Further, if the present heavy rate of unemployment continues for long, and if, as is by no means improbable, the lag in applications for age 65-70 pensions is reduced, it is likely that this surplus of  1,000,000 will rapidly be replaced by a deficiency. It seems clear, therefore, that it would be imprudent to reduce the annual State contribution to the Pensions Account at the present time, but we are of the opinion that the situation should be reviewed again in two years&apos; time in the light of the further information then available.445. Apart from the question of a possible over-estimate of the Exchequer liability the only possibility of a substantial reduction of this rapidly growing charge for pensions lies in a reduction of the basic rate of 10s. a week. This rate is obviously linked with the rate of the non-contributory old age pension, and is therefore subject to the observations made in the previous section. It may in addition be urged against any reduction of benefits under the contributory scheme that there is an actuarial relation between benefits and contributions. We do not, however, feel that there would be great force in this contention until contributions had reached the eventual maximum of Is. 3d. a wreek (men) contem-plated under the Act of 1925. We would merely add that if exist-ing pension rates are maintained it is in our view essential to the proper regulation of this serious charge on the Exchequer to bring the increases in contribution duly into operation. Should any margin on the estimates eventually emerge it should, we consider, be applied to reducing the Exchequer charge and not used either to increase benefits or to defer the increases of contributions by 2d. a week each as from 1936, 1946 and 1956, provided for in the Act of 1925. Notwithstanding these increases it would appear that the Exchequer must look forward to a steady increase in its total liability for old age pensions of all kinds and for widows&apos; and orphans&apos; pensions to over  80,000,000 a year in 30 years&apos; time, truly a serious prospect.
6.-HOUSING. A.-ENGLAND AND WALES.446. The Estimates of the Ministry of Health for the current year make the following provision for housing subsidies : (i) Housing and Town Planning Act of 1919   6,855,000(ii) Housing Act, 1923 ............   2,510,000(hi) Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924   3,160,000 (iv) Housing (Eural Workers) Act, 1926      ...       10,000 (v) Housing Act, 1930 ............      200,000Total     ............  12,735,000(i) Housing and Town Planning Act, 1919 ( 6,855,000 in 1931).447. Apart from a comparatively small charge of  81,000 per annum in respect of 50-year subsidies to Public Utility Societies and Housing Trusts, this sum represents the annual deficit on local authorities&apos; building under this Act in excess of Id. rate which was the limit of the liability of the local authority. Owing to excessive cost, the scheme was limited in July, 1921, to 176,000 houses. The average capital cost per house built under thi? scheme was  1,011 and the total capital cost approximately  178,000,000, of which  5,000,000 is attributable to the houses built by County Councils, Public Utility Societies and Housing Trusts.The total amount paid by way of subsidies up to the 31st March, 1931, was  69,598,656, made up as follows :- Local Authorities        ............   67,681,892*County Councils ............       126,439Public Utility Societies and Housing Trusts     1,790,325 69,598,656448. It is anticipated that Exchequer subsidy will continue to be paid until the loans for building (the loan sanction period for which is 60 years) have been finally repaid. These loans will expire during the period 1980-1985. Before that period is reached, how-ever, there will be a reduction in the amount of subsidy payable as other loans are finally extinguished, the loan periods for fencing, roads, and sewers being 15, 20 and 30 years, respectively. These loans amounting to approximately  330,000,  8,500,000 and  4,000,000 are expected to expire during the periods 1934-37,* Includes  172,689 for slum clearance schemes including rehousing.
1940-45 and 1950-55, respectively. The following shows roughly the effect of the repayment of loans on Exchequer subsidy : 1933-1937,  6,720,000 decreasing to  6,690,000. 1937-1940,  6,690,000.1940-1945,  6,690,000 decreasing to  5,940;000. 1945-1950,  5,940,000.1950-1955,  5,940,000 decreasing to  5,640,000.1955-1980,  5,640,000.1980-1985,  5,640,000 decreasing to nil.449. Three other factors, however, affect the position : (a) Assuming no alteration is made in the present basis of rating, the produce of the penny rate contribution of the local authorities may be expected to increase, thus decreasing the amount of the loss falling upon the Exchequer. During the past few years the average increase in rateable value and there-fore in the rate contribution has been approximately 2 per cent., due to new constructional works, etc. This ra/e of increase is not likely to be maintained, but assuming an average increase of 1 per cent, the effect will be as follows :* Estimated increase in Rate Contribution Total Estimated      and decrease in Rate subsidy comparedYear. Contribution.        ic-ith 1931-32.   1931-1932      ...... 930,000 -1934-1935      ...... 958,000 28,0001944-1945      ......        1,058,000 128,000(b) Another factor to which reference should be made is the fluctuations in interest rates. The average annual charge on loans raised to meet capital expenditure has been 6.56 per cent, (interest 6.08 per cent., annual sinking fund for repay-ment of loan 0.48 per cent.). While approximately 50 per cent, of the loans in connection with the scheme have been raised for the full loan period, at a fixed rate of interest, the balance was raised by the issue of Stock, Local Bonds and Short Term Mortgages, for periods varying from three years to 20 years and upwards. Further savings may be expected to accrue in this way, and it is calculated that, on the basis of re-borrowing at 4f per cent., they will amount to an average of about  15,000 per annum during the next four years (total  60,000) to an average of about  45,000 per annum during the succeeding five years (total  225,000), and in the year 1940, in respect of Stocks then maturing, a further saving of  350,000 will probably accrue, i.e., a total reduction on the present subsidy of  635,000 per annum.
(c) Rents are fixed in accordance with certain Rules incor-porated in the Regulations and are dependent to some extent upon the economic conditions of the working classes and upon the existing level of rents of pre-war houses. During the last seven years the average rental has fallen from 9s. 8d. per week (exclusive of rates) to 9s. 4d. per week. Any future variation in rents will affect the amount of Exchequer subsidy fro tanto.(ii) Housing &amp;c. Act, 1923 ( 2,510,000 in 1931).(a) Housing Schemes.450. Section 1 (1) of this Act authorised the Minister of Health to pay Exchequer contributions in the form of annual payments for 20 years of  6 per house towards expenses incurred by a Local Authority : (a) in promoting by assistance to private enterprise, the construction of houses of specified type and size completed before 1st October, 1925. (This date has been extended by the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924, to 1st October. 1939) :(b) in the provision of such houses by the Local Authority themselves.The Act (Section 3) also provided. for direct payment by the Minister of contributions of like amount towards expenses incurred in the construction of houses provided under approved schemes by societies, bodies of trustees or companies, which do not trade or profit, or which pay interest or dividends limited to rates prescribed by the Treasury.451. Under the Housing Acts (Revision of Contributions) Orders 1926 and 1928, made under Section 5 of the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924, the contribution payable by the Exchequer for houses completed after the 30th September, 1927, and before 1st October, 1929, is at the rate of  4 per annum, and no contribu-tion is payable for houses completed after 30th September, 1929.452. The assistance to private enterprise towards which Ex-chequer contributions are payable could be given by Local Autho-rities in any of the following ways specified in section 2 of the Act, viz. : (a) lump sum payments after completion of the house; (6) annual payments for 20 years to the person by whom the rates on the houses are payable ; or(c) the provision during a specified period of any part of the periodical sums payable by way of interest on or repayment of loans raised to meet the cost of construction.453. The amount of the assistance given by the local authority is within their discretion but the Exchequer contribution towards such assistance is limited to the amounts stated above.   In a large
proportion of cases the assistance has been in the form of lump sum payments varying from  50 to  100. Before approving schemes for promoting the building of houses by private enter-prise, the Minister is required to be satisfied that the need for such houses cannot be met without assistance.454. By the 30th September, 1929, when contributions ceased to be payable in respect of further houses, 351,232 houses had been erected under private enterprise schemes assisted by Local Autho-rities, 73,895 under schemes carried out by Local Authorities them-selves, and 11,506 by Public Utility Societies, etc., assisted directly by the Exchequer, making a total of 436,633 houses provided under the Act. The annual Exchequer commitment in respect of these houses is approximately  2,366,000, continuing until 1943 and then gradually falling until 1949.(b) Slum clearance Schemes. 455. Section 1 (3) of the Act provided for an annual contribution not exceeding one-half of the estimated average annual loss likely to be incurred by the Local Authority in carrying out slum clearance re-housing schemes. This provision has been repealed by the Housing Act, 1930, in respect of all schemes not approved before the commencement of the Act. Under the conditions approved by the Treasury under this section, the Exchequer contribution pay-able each year during the construction period is one-half of the reasonable deficit arising during the year, and after completion of each scheme is one-half of the estimated average annual deficit as approved by the Minister arising on the scheme from the year of completion to the year in which the building loans are finally redeemed.456. Of the 124 slum clearance schemes in progress since the war, 110 are assisted under this Act, 11 being assisted under the Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c, Act, 1919, and three being carried out by Local Authorities without assistance. Of the 110 schemes under the Act of 1923 , 44 were completed at 1st January, 1931. At that date 10,151 houses had been erected as rehousing in respect of the 110 schemes.457. The total capital expenditure on completion of the 110 schemes assisted under the 1923 Act is estimated at roughly  8,400,000. The annual Exchequer contribution is estimated at  90,000 for 1931-32, at  100,000 afterwards until about 1984, then being gradually extinguished in the ensuing 10 years.The cost of the 11 schemes assisted under the Act of 1919 is included in the figures regarding housing under that Act.(iii) Housing  (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924.( 3,160,000 in 1931.)458. This Act provides that in respect of schemes approved after the passing of the Act, annual Exchequer contributions at the rate
of  9 for 40 years (or  12 10s. if the house is in an agricultural parish as defined by the Act), shall be given in lieu of the con-tributions authorised by the Housing Act, 1923, for houses pro-vided by Local Authorities themselves or under schemes promoted by them for the erection of houses by private enterprise or by Public Utility Societies, &amp;c, provided that the Local Authority (or Public Utility Society) undertake that certain special conditions (including a restrictive condition as to rents) will be observed.459. Under the Housing Acts (Revision of Contributions) Order, 1926, made under Section 5 of the Act, the contribution payable by the Exchequer for houses completed after 30th September, 1927, and before 1st October, 1929, is at the rate of  7 10s. per annum for 40 years, or in agricultural parishes,  11 per annum. The Housing Acts (Revision of Contributions) Order, 1928, made pro-vision for a further reduction of the contributions for houses com-pleted after 30th September, 1929, to  6 per annum ( 9 10s. in agricultural parishes), but this provision did not come into force, as the Housing (Revision of Contributions) Act, 1929, restored the rates of  7 10s. and  11 for houses completed after 30th September, 1929. Under Section 43 of the Phrasing Act, 1930, a further review will take place after 1st October, 1933, of the contributions to be made for houses completed after a date to be specified.460. By the 31st March, 1931, 336,282 houses had been erected by Local Authorities themselves, 5,823 by private enterprise assisted by Local Authorities, and 1,534 by Public Utility Societies assisted directly by the Minister, giving a total of 343,639 houses provided under the Act. In addition definite arrangements had been made for construction of a further 48,414 by Local Authorities, 1,475 by private enterprise, and 274 by Public Utility Societies.The annual Exchequer commitment in respect of houses com-pleted by 31st March, 1931, is approximately  2,880,000 con-tinuing until 1965 and then gradually decreasing until 1971.(iv) Housing (Rural Wokkees) Act, 1926.    10,000 in 1931.461. Under this Act Local Authorities are empowered, where applications are received before 1st October, 1931, to give assistance towards the cost of reconstruction or improvement of houses or buildings in order to provide housing accommodation for agricul-itural workers and others of like economic condition. Assistance may be given by way of lump sum grant or of annual payments for a period not exceeding 20 years. The value of the grant must not exceed either two-thirds of the estimated cost of the work, or  100 in respect of each dwelling. The application for assistance must under the Act have been made before the 1st October, 1931, but it is proposed under the Bill at present before Parliament to extend the period for a further five years.
Where assistance is given by way of grant, the Minister is authorised to pay contributions equal to one-half of the estimated annual payments falling (to be made by the Local Authority in respect of charges on loans raised for the purpose or which would have fallen to be sc made if loans had been raised.462. Up to the 31st December, 1930, assistance had been promised by Local Authorities by way of grants in respect of 4,024 dwellings to a total of  312,329. Work had been finished on the same date of 2,998 dwellings and grants paid to a total of  224,930. assuming-ing that a further 400 dwellings were completed during the quarter ended 31st March, 1931, and further grants to an amount of  30,000 paid, the annual Exchequer commitment in respect of the dwellings finished at 31st March, 1931, is approximately  10,000 for 20 years.It may be assumed that further grants amounting to  200,000 will be paid under the Act after 31st March, 1931, which will increase the Exchequer liability under the Act to a total of  18,000 per annum for 20 years.463. Extension of the operation of the Act for a further five years, will involve an estimated additional Exchequer liability of about  30,000 per annum for 20 years.(v) Housing Act, 1930-( 200,000 in 1931).464. Under this Act Exchequer contributions may be paid in the form of annual payments for 40 years towards expenses incurred by a Local Authority in connection with action taken by them under the Act for dealing with unhealthy areas or for the demolition-tion of insanitary houses or for the closing of parts of buildings, and in connection with the provision and maintenance of housing accommodation rendered necessary by such action.465. The annual contribution is normally at the rate of  2 5s. for each person displaced by action taken under the Act, in so far as suitable accommodation in new houses has been made avail-able. Increased contributions of  2 10s. per person are payable in the case of persons displaced from agricultural parishes and of  3 10s. per person where rehousing accommodation is provided in tenement buildings of more than three storeys on the site of a cleared area, or on other sites the cost (or in certain case, value) of which exceeds  3,000 per acre. Payment of the contributions is contingent on the observance of certain special conditions as to letting and as to restriction of the rents ito be charged in respect of the new houses.466. No payments have yet been made under this Act. A sum of  200,000 has been provided in the estimates for 1931-32 in respect of Exchequer subsidy.

The large increase shown for the year ended 31st March, 1928, was due to special efforts made to complete houses before the reduction of subsidy on the 1st October, 1927, under the Acts of 1923 and 1924. The increase in the year ended 31st March, 1930, similarly was due to the desire to complete houses before the termination on the 30th September, 1929, of subsidy under the Act of 1923. The number of State-assisted houses under construc-tion on the 31st March, 1929, 1930 and 1931, respectively were as follows.

Future Liability. 469. An estimate has been prepared of the capital value (on a 4f per cent, basis) at 31st March, 1931, of the outstanding Ex-chequer liabilities under the various Housing Acts, and we append it together with a statement of the number of houses covered in each case : 	Capital Value of	Housing Act of	liabilities at 31st March,	Number of houses built.	1931.		 	1919.........	111,625,000	176,0001923   .........	27,215,000	436,6331924.........	49,672,000	343,6391926  .........	127,000	3,398Total    ......	 188,639,000	959,670470. These figures relate of course to houses already built. Any estimate of the future growth of the annual charge is necessarily very speculative. The following figures have been submitted to us by the Ministry of Health on the basis of surveys prepared by local authorities under the Atet of 1930, but with housing subsidies at the present high level they may well be exceeded.Year.

We view with deep concern this steadily growing charge upon the Exchequer, and the similar though smaller charges on local rates, for the housing of the working classes. There is serious danger of the nation, gradually and without forethought, finding itself committed to the principle that a man&apos;s wages are not normally intended to enable him to pay fully for his housing. In our view such a development would be a grave mistake from every point of view, and we can see no ground of principle why it should stop at housing. We regard the principle embodied in the Housing Act, 1924, of a subsidy gradually declining with the cost of housing as thoroughly sound, and we can only regret that the Act has not been applied in accordance with the clear intentions of its authors.   We submit a table showing (i) the average cost.
of non-parlour houses for each quarter since 1925, (ii) the capita-lised value of the subsidy payable under the Act of 1924 in urban areas, and (iii) the rate charged by the Public Works Loans Board for housing loans. In explanation of the last column we would point out that the rate of interest to be paid on the capital has an important bearing on the economic rent necessary to pay for a house and therefore in the need for subsidy. On a house costing  400, repaid over 60 years, a reduction from 5 to 4f per cent, in the rate of interest is equivalent to a capital subsidy of about  17.Quarter ended	Average estimated all-in cost per non-parlour house.*	Exchequer subsidy.

It will be seen that by the autumn of 1927, when the sub-sidy was reduced in value by  26, the cost of building had fallerTby practically the same amount. In the following two years the average cost showed a further fall of over  60, and on this basis, notwithstanding some increase in the rate of interest, the further reduction of about  26 in the subsidy, which was to be made by
the Housing Acts (Revision of Contributions) Order, 1928, would have been fully justified. Before that Order could come into opera-tion, however, the proposed reduction of subsidies under the Act of 1924 was cancelled by the Housing (Bevision of Contributions) Act, 1929 (26th July, 1929), and it is significant that since September, 1929, there has been no fall whatever in housing costs in England and Wales (except in the rate of interest), and this in spite of the facts (1) that the prices of raw commodities generally have fallen heavily and (2) that there has been materially less pressure on the building industry generally during this period than in previous years. We find it difficult to resist the conclusion that the high rates of subsidy have played a part in keeping up the cost of house building.473. Be that as it may, the clear need of the moment seems to us to place the housing subsidies on a basis of principle that shall lead to their entire abolition as regards ordinary working class housing (i.e. apart from slum clearance schemes and special pro-vision for exceptional classes) when building costs (including rates of interest) have fallen to a level reasonably related to the general cost of living for the working classes. Taking as our standard type for this purpose the ordinary non-parlour house, now costing in England and Wales about  410, we are advised that a similar house would have cost just before the war about  250. The Local Loans rate of interest for housing loans was then 3?j per cent. If we take the appropriate rent of such a house (after allowing 20 per cent, for repairs, empties, etc.) as  12 10s. Od. per annum and assume a rise in the general standard of working class rents of say 40 to 45 per cent., i.e. to about  18, we find that this rent would be sufficient (assuming repairs etc. at 20 per cent, of rent and repayment of loan over 60 years) to provide an economic return on a house costing  327 when interest had fallen to 4 per cent. We suggest that these should be adopted as the standard conditions which should be held to justify the complete withdrawal of subsidies for ordinary house building and that a steady policy of adjustment of the subsidy should be followed with this end in view.474. The above rent of  18 per annum would suffice to give an economic return :  With interest at 4 per cent, on 327 4J ,, 3124J ,, 298 4f ,, 285 5 ,, 27351 ,, 262)) if
475. In the initial period of tEe Wheatley Act the average all-in cost of the non-parlour house was  510 and the Local Loans rate was 4f per cent. On the above table the appropriate subsidy would have been  510 -  285 =  225. The actual capital value of the subsidy at that time was :     s.   d.Exchequer grant Local rates (not exceeding)Total (not exceeding)......     232 10   0which shows that the above assumptions are in close agreement with the financial basis of the Wheatley Act.476. In the Autumn of 1929 with an average cost of  419 and interest at 5J per cent, the appropriate total subsidy would have been  419- 262^157. If this had been divided between the Exchequer and local rates in the original proportions, the Ex-chequer charge would have been  105 or almost exactly that contemplated in the Housing Order of 1928. ( 6 per annum for 40 years at 5 per cent. ?f  103.)477. At the present time with the interest rate again at 4J per. cent, and total costs at  419, the appropriate subsidy would be  419 -  298 =  121 of which the Exchequer share would be  81, equivalent to a grant of  4J for 40 years. In our view there-fore there is ample ground for a reduction of the housing subsidies by  2 10s. per annum and we suggest that this should be applied to all houses completed after the 30th April -next, i.e. to  5 in urban areas and  8 10s. in rural areas. A corresponding reduction should be made in the rates of grant under the Housing Act, 1930, which are based upon the subsidies payable under the Wheatley Act. It will readily be gathered from this recommendation that we should find it difficult on any of our principles of housing finance to justify an increase, instead of a decrease, in the Exchequer subsidies for housing in rural areas as contemplated in the Bill now before Parliament.478. We recommend that further revisions of the subsidies under the Acts of 1924 and 1930 should be made at two yearly intervals, the first with effect from 1st October, 1933, on the basis set out above.155 .0 0 77 10   0

Housing since the War has followed much the same course in Scotland as in England. In the main the legislation has been the same for both countries and we need only refer therefore to special Scottish features.
Total............   21,955The annual Exchequer contribution for 1931-32 is estimated at  113,657.   Houses are being built at the rate of 1,400 per annum.481. The number of houses erected under this Act was limited to 25,550 costing on the average about  900 each.  8,951,748 had been paid in subsidy up to 31st March last and the present annual charge of  976,000 is expected to fall to  954,663 in 1932-33 and to decrease to about  850,000 by 1945 as a result of repayment of loans and increase of the rate deduction. 78 per cent, of the loans are for periods of 3, 5 and 7 years and have already been renewed at lower rates of interest.(ii) Housing dc. Act, 1923.482. The Exchequer grant under this Act, as in England, was originally  6 per annum for 20 years. Owing to the slower progress of housing in Scotland and to the somewhat higher cost of building no reduction was made either under this Act or under the follow-ing Act of 1924 when the first abatements were made in England in 1926 but under the Housing Acts (Revision of Contributions) Order, 1928, made under Section 5 of the Housing (Einancial Provisions) Act, 1924, the contribution payable by the Exchequer for houses completed after 30th September, 1929, was reduced from  6 to  4 per annum.(a) Private enterprise.483. As far as private enterprise is concerned the general practice of local authorities in Scotland is to make the payment by way of a lump sum. Before the reduction of the Exchequer contribution the amount of assistance offered by local authorities varied from  75 (the capital equivalent of the Exchequer contribution) to  150 per house. After the reduction of the Exchequer contribution in 1929, the lump sum offered by the local authorities has varied from  50 to  75 or thereabouts. The amount of grant paid by local authorities in excess of the Exchequer contribution is met out of local rates.484. The position of building by subsidised private enterprise (in-cluding Public Utility Societies) at 31st March, 1931, was as follows : &apos;Houses completed   ...      ...       ...      ...&quot;      ...   19,409,,     under construction ...      ...      ...     1,424,,     approved, but not yet begun    ...      ...     1,122

Under the Housing Acts (Revision of Contributions) Order, 1928 (the Order of 1926 did not apply to Scotland) made under Section 5 of the Act, the contributions payable by the Exchequer for houses completed after 30th September, 1929, were to be reduced to  7 10s. per house per annum for 40 years, or in rural areas to  11 per house per annum. This revision, however, did not come into force, as the Housing (Revision of Contributions) Act, 1929, restored the original rates.At 31st March, 1931, the position of building was as follows : 	By local	By private		authorities.	enterprise.

Building by local authorities under this Act has ceased, as they prefer to build with the aid of the larger subsidy under the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924. Altogether local authorities have built 4,033 houses under the Act of 1923 (excluding slum clearance houses, to which reference is made in the next paragraph).(c) Slum Clearance.486. Section 1 (3) of the Act provided for an annual contribution not exceeding one-half of the average loss incurred by local authori-ties in providing houses for persons dispossessed consequent upon slum clearance schemes. This grant has been superseded by the grant under the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1930, but will continue to be paid in respect of commitments entered into by the Department with local authorities prior to the coming into force of the Act of 1930.

Up to 31st March, 1931, assistance had been promised by local authorities by way of grants in respect of 7,662 dwellings ito a total of  662,973, or at the rate of  85 per house. The annual Exchequer contribution in these cases was approximately  26,600, or nearly  3 10s. per house per annum. The Exchequer contri-bution in respect of houses covered by applications estimated to be received by 30th September next and approved for grant is  33,000. If the Act is extended for a further five years as now proposed, it is estimated that a further 15,100 houses will be improved in Scotland with the aid of grants as from September, 1931, to September, 1936. On the basis of the present grants, the average additional Exchequer liability will be about  10,000 for each of the additional five years. On these estimates, the total increase of Exchequer liability at the end of five years will be approximately  50,000 per annum, making, with the estimated annual liability of  33,000 at the end of September, 1931, a total annual liability of  83,000, declining from 1947 onwards as the loans of the local authorities are repaid. The charge on local rates will be equal to that on the Exchequer.(v) Housing (Scotland) Act, 1930.489. No payments have yet been made under this Act. A sum of  20,000 has been provided in the estimates for 1931-32 in respect of Exchequer subsidy.(vi) Other Housing Schemes.490. No further houses are now being built under the Rosyth Housing Scheme (1,702 houses) or the Steel Houses Scheme (2,552 houses).

Comparing this table with that on page 182 it will be ob-served that these figures of cost have throughout been some  50 less than the average for the English non-parlour house.496. The proportion of cost represented by the subsidy in England is now about 31 per cent. We are aware that the difference in cost is attributable to the fact that the typical Scottish house is rather smaller than the typical English house, and that the English type would actually cost somewhat more to build in Scotland. But this does not in our view warrant the present differentiation in favour of Scotland, neither can we see any good reason for giving Scot-land more &quot;favourable treatment because her local authorities may have been somewhat slower in taking advantage of the facilities available.497. In our view this disparity of treatment should be brought to an end as soon as this can conveniently be arranged. We recom-mend that the Scottish rates of subsidy under the Housing Acts of 1924 and 1930 should be reduced in respect of houses completed
after April next by the same amounts as in England, that the sub-sidy under the Act of 1923 should then be entirely withdrawn, and that as from 1st October, 1932, all subsidy rates in Scotland should be brought down to the rates applicable to houses completed after that date in England.7.-EDUCATION.498. The total net expenditure of local education authorities in England and Wales on elementary and higher education within the purview of the Board of Education has increased since 1913-14 from  30,010,000 to  83,690,000 (estimated) for the current year. In 1921-22 the total reached a maximum of  73,146,000 : it then declined to  67,602,000 in 1923-24. In the last eight years there-fore, there has been an increase of  16,000,000 and apart from the raising of the school-leaving age (which was estimated to in-volve an additional expenditure of  6,250.000 in the first full year rising to  8,000,000 in the year 1935-36) it is estimated that the total net expenditure of local education authorities will have in-creased by a further  3,500,000 by 1932.499. This is by no means the whole cost of education in this country. Assistance is given both by the State and by local authori-ties to university education and by the State to a large number of schools managed by governing bodies and the total charge on public funds for 1913-14 and for each year since 1922-23 is shown in the following table : Year beginning 1st April.

The table shows that the total cost of this service to public funds has nearly trebled since 1913-14 and that whereas the amount falling on rates has risen by 140 per cent, the amount falling on taxes has increased 220 per cent.
501. Many causes have conduced to this rapid expansion not the least of which has been the great transference of charge from the administering authorities to the Exchequer and the placing of a powerful lever in the hands of the Board of Education-in the form of percentage grants. In using this lever to urge on local authorities the Board have admittedly had behind them a weighty force of public opinion. Educational progress has been a popular plank in election platforms since the war and we fear that a tendency has developed to regard expenditure on education as good in itself without much consideration of the. results that are being obtained for it and of the limits to which it can,be carried without danger to other, no less vital, national interests.502. Since the standard of education, elementary and secondary, that is being given to the child of poor parents is already in&apos;very many cases superior to that which the middle class parent is pro-viciing for his own child, we feel that it is time to pause in this policy of expansion, to consolidate the ground gained, to endeavour to reduce the cost of holding it, and to reorganise the existing machine before making a fresh general advance.503. First among the changes that we consider necessary in the interests of efficient administration we would place the reduction in the number of authorities by the concentration of all educational functions, as far as local authorities are concerned, in the hands of the county and county borough councils. There are 317 Local Education Authorities for elementary education and 146 Local Education Authorities for higher education. The authorities for elementary education consist of London, 62 counties (excluding London), 83 county boroughs, 131 boroughs and 40 urban districts, making a total of 317. The Authorities for higher education con-sist of London, 62 counties (excluding London) and 83 county boroughs, making a total of 146.504. The local bodies which are Local Education Authorities for elementary but not for higher education are now 131 boroughs which, according to the Census of 1901 had populations of more than 10,000, and 40 urban districts which had populations of more than 20,000. (These are commonly known as &quot; Part III Areas &quot; because their duties are primarily those imposed upon them by that part of the Education Act, 1902.) Consequently the 62 counties which are authorities for elementary education do not comprise the same areas as the 62 counties which are authorities for higher education, because they only administer so much of the areas as remain after the 131 boroughs and the 40 urban districts have been taken out of them. As authorities for higher education, however, the 62 counties comprise the whole area within the county boundaries excepting only that of the county boroughs. We do not question the high efficiency in-their limited sphere of many of the minor authorities now exercising powers over some part
of the educational field, but the service is now developing under the recommendations of the Hadow Committee in a manner which is rapidly breaking down the old distinction between elementary and higher education. The dividing line of the future will be. less between elementary and higher education than between educa-tion under and over 11 years of age. As long as the Part III areas remain there will be overlapping jurisdiction, competition and confusion in the education of the older children. Another im-^ portant tendency in educational progress is towards the development of more specialised services which it would be wasteful for many of the smaller units to provide. We would further point out that the present division of the administration of the elementary educa-tion service among 317 authorities inevitably means that many of these areas contain abnormal communities, some especially wealthy and some so poor as to require an exceptional measure of State assistance. Of the 29 areas receiving the Necessitous Areas Grant (referred to below) no less than 22 are Part III areas. The action which we recommend in regard to this service with a view to increasing efficiency and reducing rate inequalities would be in complete agreement with the general policy of the Local Government Act, 1929, in regard to other services of national importance.505. It would be an essential part of this reform that the county councils and county borough councils should take over from the Board of Education the entire responsibility for supervising and helping, where necessary, private educational effort in their areas.These changes would remove the chief obstacles to bringing this service within the block grant system set up under the Local Government Act. Under that system the element of local responsibility would be increased and the Board of Education would be able to substitute a general advisory supervision of the service for its present meticulous control.506. We realise however that such reforms will take a consider-able time to effect and we accordingly submit recommendations for such temporary adjustments as seem to us desirable in the mean-while.1. Elementary Education.507. The existing main grant for elementary education is given by the formula : (a) 36s. a child in average attendance;(b) 60 per cent, of teachers&apos; salaries;50 per cent, of special services, maintenance allowances, and, as regards the period 1st September, 1929 to 3.1st August, 1932, loan charges and other ex-penditure on reorganisation and development;20 per cent, of remaining expenditure;10905 o
(d) If the result is less than 50 per cent, of the net expendi-ture the grant is made up to this proportion.This formula originated with the proposals of the Kempe Com-mittee of 1914, but the percentage element in the formula recom-mended by that Committee was limited to 40 per cent. The in-crease to 60 per cent, in the case of teachers&apos; salaries was given in order to induce local authorities to increase the general standard of teachers&apos; remuneration. That object has not only been fully achieved but in our view there is now urgent need for a reduction. We recommend in Chapter Iii of this report that this reduction should be not less than 20 per cent. Inasmuch as the increase of teachers&apos; salaries was made the occasion for raising the percentage grant towards such expenditure we now recommend that the benefit of this reduction should be secured to the Exchequer by reducing the grant to 50 per cent.At the same time the special increase of grant in respect of loan charges and expenditure on reorganization and development incurred during the three years 1929-32 should be withdrawn forth-with subject to the honouring of existing commitments.508. Were the existing minimum limit of grant of 50 per cent, (under (d) above) to continue in force, these recommendations would be inoperative in the wealthier areas of the country, because any reduction of grant thereunder in these areas would be made up under the guarantee. This would be quite unjustifiable. We understand that the 50 per cent, minimum formed no part of the Kempe Committee&apos;s recommendations. It does in fact tend to defeat one of the most important objects of the formula recom-mended by that Committee, viz., the differentiation of the grant between rich and jx)or areas, and we recommend that it be with-drawn.509. In making these recommendations, which involve loss-of grant to the richer authorities and the loss of a possible saving to all, we have taken into account the fact that the reduction of the produce of the rate of 7d. in consequence of the derating of indus-trial and agricultural property under the Local Government Act did in fact result in an increase of about  1,000,000 in the education grant, which we understand was entirely additional to the relief in-tended to be given to local authorities as set forth in the financial memorandum attached to the Local Government Bill.510. Another exception to the plain working of the elementary education grant formula is afforded by a limited group of necessitous areas. Prior to 1930, areas which after receipt of the formula grant would have had a rate burden for this service exceeding 3s. 6d. in the   were given an extra grant of 50 per cent, of the excess; the
-amount so distributed in 1929 being  250,000. Thus any addi-tional expenditure attracting the ordinary formula grant of 50 per cent, or 60 per cent, fell as to 75 per cent, or 80 per cent, on the Exchequer. It is not surprising to find that under this strong incentive to expenditure the cost of education in many of these areas has risen to a very high figure. Owing to the alterations made by the Local Government Act this basis of distribution is no longer workable and pending the formulation of a new scheme the distribution has been stereotyped on the 1929-30 basis with an addi-tion of 20 per cent. We have already pointed out that many of these areas are financially too weak to form suitable independent units of administration and the majority would be merged in larger areas under the reforms recommended above. Fending this  in our opinion the only proper remedy we recommend that any revised basis of distribution should avoid the strong incentive to expenditure contained in the old scheme. We recognize that in so doing it will in all probability be necessary to widen the field of distribution of the grant and on this account we have allowed for some increase of the existing amount of  300,000.2. Higher Education.511. Higher Education comprises a wide field of activities. In so far as these are carried on by local authorities the State contributes one half of the cost that would otherwise fall on the rates. To-other bodies the State makes various grants on a capitation basis. Complete information as to the cost of higher education in this country is not available. The net expenditure of local education authorities in recent years is shown on page 196.

512. Prior to the war the Exchequer contribution towards this expenditure was in the main on a capitation basis but under the Education Act, 1918, it was placed on a 50 per cent, basis. Up to 31st March, 1930,  807,000 of the grant was paid through the Local Taxation Account, the balance being provided on the Board of Education Vote, but since that date the whole amount has been so provided.513. The Geddes Committee commented on the &quot; extreme rapidity &quot; with which this expenditure was expanding at the time of their enquiry, the preliminary estimates for 1922-3 being as high as  16,200,000. The national movement in favour of economy brought the actual expenditure for that year down to  11,655,000, and it was not till 1927 that the expenditure of 1921 was exceeded. Since then the growth has averaged  1,000,000 a year. Part of this growth has been the result of the transfer of schools from the category of those aided directly by the Board of Education to that of schools aided by the local authority (with the assistance of a State grant). This transfer followed the recommendation of the Geddes Committee that no school should receive grant through both channels, and was effected over a period of years as is shown by the table below of grants for higher education to bodies other than local education authorities :  Grants for Higher Education to Bodies other than Local EducationAuthorities.Financial Year.

514. Under the operation of the percentage grant to local educa-tion authorities the Exchequer will obtain one half of the saving in teachers&apos; salaries (resulting from our recommendation in Chapter III) as far as their own institutions are concerned. Steps should be taken to secure a similar saving to the Exchequer as regards institutions aided by local education authorities. Grants to bodies other than local education authorities are mainly on a capitation basis. We recommend that the rates of grant be revised to give the Exchequer the benefit of one half of the saving to be anticipated on teachers&apos; salaries in these cases also. The total Exchequer saving to be made in the field of higher education from the reduction of teachers&apos; salaries we estimate at about  950,000.515. In addition we consider that steps should be taken to slow down the rapid growth of expenditure from public funds on secondary education resulting both from the provision of additional schools and also from the steady increase in the proportion of free places in such schools. Since 1920 the number of free places in secondary schools has practically doubled, while the number of fee payers has shown little change. The following table shows the position up to October 1930, the latest date for which figures are available : Date.	Pupils paying fees.	Pupils paying no fees.	Total.31st March, 1920	206,891	101,375	308,266,,    1922	221,584	133,372	354,956,,    1924...	215,128	134,013	349,141,,    1926...	217,261	143,242	360,503,,    1928...	217,187	160,353	377,540,,    1929...	217,739	169,254	386,9931st October 1930	218,961	198,024	416,985(estd.)			Plans for new schools already approved and in course of erection are estimated to bring the above total up to about 440,000, of which roughly one half will be free places.516. Taking into account the very large provision for secondary education made in institutions not aided from public funds and the certainty of a marked decline in the number of children of secondary school age in the near future owing to the heavy fall in the birth-rate since 1920, we consider that this provision should in present financial circumstances be regarded as adequate.517. We are further of the opinion that a large proportion of the total expenditure can and should be met from fees charged to parents who can afford to pay them. The present system under which certain local authorities have been allowed to free their schools entirely and, through the percentage grant, to throw one half the cost of this local benefit on to the country gener-ally, which has not adopted this policy seems to us inequitable.
This situation will be fully met by the general reform of educational administration and grants recommended above, but in the mean-time we think that the existing policy in regard to fees should be reviewed.. While local authorities should be free to charge, or not to charge, fees as they choose, we suggest that the State grant to any area with an average fee income per scholar below the national average for the preceding year should be based on the assumption that that average fee income is in fact received. We recommend further that the grant of a free place should be conditional on the parent being able to show that he cannot afford even a modified fee. In other cases the scale of fees should be increased more nearly to the standard of what the parent would be willing to pay to&apos; a private school. In these ways we consider that it should be possible to increase the total income from fees by not less than 25 per cent., or roughly  1,000,000, of which one half should be secured to the Exchequer by the operation of the 50 per cent, grant or by an alteration in capitation rates.518. Finally, reference must be made to the fact that on existing policy the Exchequer charge in respect of education is estimated to be about  2,250,000 more in 1932 than in 1931, and that amount, with a proportionate increase for Scotland, has been included in the forecast on page 9.  350,000 of this will be required for the rapidly growing charge for teachers&apos; pensions and a considerable further sum may be needed to meet other unavoidable commit-ments, but we trust that if local authorities recognize the urgent need for economy at the present time, the increase will be limited to  1,000,000.519. The financial effect of the foregoing recommendations may be summarized as follows : -England and Wales  1. Abolition of 50 per cent, minimum limit of3. Reduction of grants for higher education in consequence of(1) 20 per cent reduction of teachers&apos; ;:,salaries,     ............ 950,000(2) increase of school fees     ... 500,000 4.

The corresponding saving in Scotland will therefore he    ...      1,640,000making a total of.............    13,590,000say  13,600,000.This represents the total reduction in the first full year. As, how-ever, the education grants are paid as to 90 per cent, on account each year, the balance being adjusted in the following year, the saving in 1932 would be only 90 per cent, of this sum, but we trust that the general effect, of our recommendations would be to effect a greater reduction than  13,500,000 as compared with the ex-penditure that would otherwise have been incurred in subsequent years&quot;. The amount is large because the growth of expenditure has been large. None of the reductions we recommend involves the withdrawal of any educational facility now being afforded.Grants to Universities.520. The State grants to universities are made on the recommen-dation of a Treasury Committee from a Special Vote. In 1922 the total sum available for distribution (which had been increased from  1,250,000 to  1,500,000 in 1920) was reduced on the recommenda-tion of the Geddes Committee to the previous figure of  1,250,000, but the increase of  250,000 was again made on a review in 1925. On the next quinquennial review in 1930 the total sum was further increased to  1,750,000 for the next 5 years. We understand that in so far as the increased grants have been applied by univer-necessities to recurrent needs they have gone largely to increase salaries. Having regard to our recommendations in other fields of education we consider that this extra  250,000 should be discontinued.521. We are informed that no small part of the growing needs of the universities represents the maintenance of additional institu-tions provided out of capital benefactions. In some cases, we understand, the rule has been adopted of only accepting capital benefactions where a suitable portion of the amount has been allocated as an endowment fund, and we commend^ this rule for general adoption.
chapter vii.MISCELLANEOUS.1. WAR   PENSIONS.522. Pensions in respect of service in the Fighting Forces in the war are payable by the Ministry of Pensions established in 1916. Pensions to merchant seamen and fishermen payable under the War Eisks Compensation Schemes set up in 1915 are charged to a separate Vote-Merchant Seamen&apos;s War Pensions adminis-tered,by the Board of Trade.

Estimates prepared by the Government Actuary in connection with the Widows&apos; Orphans&apos; and Old Age Pensions Scheme in 1925 showed that the charge would not fall to one half of the present amount for twenty years and that even in 1965 the country would still be paying  10,000,000 for pensions for a war fought nearly half a century before. These forecasts are neces-sarily based on the assumption that the general principles on which the liability of the State for compensation is determined remain in substance unimpaired. The creation of any new clasa of pensioner or relaxation of the existing standards of title to pension would at once throw out these estimates, and might indeed convert a slowly diminishing expenditure into an increas-ing one.Expenditure on administration,524. At the time of the Geddes Committee on National Expendi-ture (1922) the cost of administration was  5,524,100, which was equivalent to Is. 2tyd. per   of benefit expenditure. For the current year the expenditure is estimated at  1,039,500, represent-ing SrV- Per   of benefit expenditure. Some further con-traction in the cost of administration should still be effected as the volume of the Ministry&apos;.s work is reduced.Medical Treatment.525. The medical expenditure of the Ministry has shown a sub-stantial decline and is still decreasing. The decrease of expendi-ture follows on the diminished demand for medical treatment, of which the most costly portion is, of course, hospital treatment. At the time of the Geddes Committee, 1921-22, the hospital treat-ment accounted for  5,750,000 out of a total expenditure on medi-cal treatment of  7,300,000; in the current year it is estimated to amount to not more than  1,130,000. The latter sum is made up of :  Hospitals and clinics controlled by the Ministry ...     265,000 Red Cross, and other voluntary institutions, includ-.. ing Public Civil Hospitals .........     370,000Sanatoria for Tuberculosis    ...       ...      ...      ...     100,000Public Mental Hospitals       ............     395,000 1,130,000The number of the Ministry&apos;s own hospitals has been substantially i-educed. In 1921-22 the Ministry were controlling and maintaining 67 hospitals with:a bed accommodation of 13,970 and 115 clinics. In the&apos;current year Ministry institutions number 16 hospitals with : a bed accommodation of 2,349 and 24 clinics, and by the end of the year two;-and possibly&apos;three, of these hospitals will have been closed.
The Ministry have been able to utilise the accommodation of a number of Red Cross and other Voluntary Hospitals as well a3 public civil hospitals, the accommodation of which is paid for usually by a capitation fee per case, and the Ministry have found it of advantage to use these in view of the general decline in thfi need for treatment in preference to maintaining institutions of theii own. We understand that a close watch is accordingly kept upon hospital accommodation and Ministry institutions are closed where their continued maintenance is no longer justified.526. Some further concentration of hospital accommodation may be expected, but a nucleus of hospitals, properly distributed with-regard to the needs of various parts of the country, will be neces-sary for some years to come. There will be for some time a number of wound and injury cases, of severe neurasthenic and quasi-mental cases and some other special classes whose condition will period-cally require treatment and who can be more advantageously dealt with in institutions where their case history is known.Pensions and Treatment Allowances.-527. The annual decline in the cost of pensions and treatment allowances is a net figure representing the balance between the known factors of decrease and increase. The former comprise deaths among all classes of pensioners (at present about 22,000 annually) : remarriages of widows (a diminishing number) : children ceasing to be of dependent age (16) and entitled to allowances (a substantial but rapidly diminishing factor, which will disappear by 1936-37) : and reduction of pension (a diminishing factor, though never wholly disappearing) and in the amount of medical treatment required. The factors of decrease are known and can be estimated with tolerable accuracy. The factors of increase are more uncertain, as for example fresh grants of pension to widows and dependants (at present about 2,000 a year) : fresh grants in cases of late claims for disablement a comparatively small number, which will probably diminish : increase of pension on re-assess-ment (an uncertain factor liable to be affected by climatic con-ditions, unemployment, etc.) : and minor grants of vai-ious kinds needed for education, sickness, etc.528. One factor which the Geddes Committee contemplated as operating to reduce the cost of pensions was a reduction of the rates of pension in accordance with the fall in the cost of living.529. The improved rates of pensions made effective by the Royal Warrant of 1919 were deemed to be based on the cost of living for that year (average index figure of Ministry of Labour 115.25) and Article 24A provided that such rates should be subject to increase or decrease in accordance with the increased or decreased coat of
living as compared with that for 1919. For this purpose a certifi-cate was issued by the Minister of Labour in January of each year showing the cost of living for the previous year as compared with the year 1919. The cost of living is defined to be the general cost et living of working class families.530. It was further provided that oo re-adjustment of rates should take effect before the 1st April, 1923, and then only if the cost of living for 1922 differed from that for 1919 by at least 5 per cent, of the cost of living in 1919, and similarly, subsequent annual adjustments would be made only if the variation in the cost of living since the previous re-adjustment amounted to 5 per cent, of the cost of living in 1919. Certain minimum rates, below which reduction should not be made, representing generally the rates of pension in force before the Warrant of 1919, were scheduled in the Warrant. These minimum rates are equivalent approxi-mately to the pensions payable under the terms of Article 24A when the Ministry of Labour index figure stands at 72.531. The cost of living for the year 1922 was certified by the Minister of Labour to be 85 per cent, of that in 1919 so that on the 1st April, 1923, a re-adjustment of rates to the extent of 15 per cent, was indicated, but in November 1922, in reply to a question asked in the House of Commons, the Minister stated that the Government had decided that no revision of pension under Article 24A of the Royal Warrant on account of the fall in the cost of living should be made within a period up to three years after the 1st April, 1923. During this interval the practicability of a settle-ment of pension rates on a less fluctuating basis than that pro-vided under Article 24A was engaging the attention of the Gov-ernment. In June 1925, in the House of Commons, the Minister announced that as a temporary measure, pending a more per-manent settlement, the Government had decided to extend the period of immunity from reductions in respect of the declining cost of living until at least March 1927.532. At the end of July 1925 (when the index figure of the cost of living stood at 73) this question was again raised in the House and in reply the Minister, at somewhat greater length, reviewed the essential facts from the date of the Warrant of 1919 and ex-plained that it was always the view of the Government that the operation of the Warrant in regard to rates should, in the interests of pensioners, be conditional on a reasonable stability being reached in the.cost of living. After full consideration of all the known factors, the Government of the day decided that a substantially larger measure of security than had already been announced could
be given to the pensioner and that no change in the rates then current would be made so long as the average coat of living re-remained between 60 per cent, and 115.25 per cent, in excess of the pre-war cost of living and furthermore, to give still further security to the pensioner, the cost of living would be on an average over three years instead of one year and that such averaga would not operate before 1929.533. In July 1928 a further step was. taken. The index figure of the cost of living stood then at 65 and looked like being fairly stabilised at or about that figure. The Government considered it desirable to remove both the uncertainty felt by pensioners and also, a recurrent subject of political contention, by settling finally the rates of pension. The Minister accordingly made public the Governmenfs decision that existing rates should be stabilised so far as they were dependent on the cost of living: It was, however, made a condition of the maintenance of these rates that should any substantial change be made in the principles of pension administra-tion involving the admission of new classes of pensioners, to whom the existing high rates of pensions would automatically become applicable, the Government of the day must be free to review the rates of pension in the light of its aggregate liability.534. Were the adjustment in respect of the fall in the cost of living now brought into effect the saving on the Vote for this year would we are informed be no less than  6,250,000. While it is true that at the time that the announcement in July 1928 of stabilisation was made by the late Government no one anticipated a further large fall in the cost of living we nevertheless feel that the announcement in July 1928 prevents any re-opening of this question except as part of any comprehensive scheme of reduction of pension charges of all kinds. We refer to this aspect of the matter in our concluding chapter. We must however stress the qualifying condition governing the promise of stabilisation viz., that there should be no substantial change in the principles of pension administration.2.-BRITISH    BROADCASTING    CORPORATION.535. The agreement between the Post Office, and the British Broadcasting Corporation dated 1st January, 1927, provides (clause 18) that, subject to the provision of funds by Parliament, the Post Office shall pay annually to the Corporation the following per-centages of the gross, revenue derived from wireless receiving licences

The agreement also provides that the Postmaster Genera! &quot;will consider any application made by the Corporation after 1st January, 1929, for an increase in these payments on the ground that they are insufficient for the performance by the Corporation of its obligations under its Charter and Licence.537. By a Supplementary Agreement dated 11th June, 1931 r the percentage deducted for cost of collection was reduced from 12J to 10 and provision was included for the payment, subject to the approval of Parliament, to the Corporation of an additional grant of  17,500 a year in aid of a subsidy to the G-rand Opera Syndicate.538. The principle of the financial arrangements with the Corporation is that it has no legitimate claim upon the whole or any specified part of the revenue derived from wireless licences but that it should be supplied with adequate funds for maintaining the broadcasting service. Por this purpose the sliding scale based upon the number of licences was framed and accepted by the Corpora-tion as a convenient formula to secure them an income which would expand as their clientele of listeners increased.539. We understand that at the time that the main agreement was under discussion it was generally contemplated that a revenue-of about  800,000 per annum would meet requirements. The rapid growth shown in the following table was not then anticipated : 
540. The Corporation expenditure and income during the past four years have been as follows :  Income. 	1927.	1928.	1929.	1930.Receipts from Post Office ... Publications ... Interest	  800,959 93,686 6,980	  871,800 120,600 10,100	  944,301 138,852 14,184	  1,043,023 160,209 21,122 	901,625	1,002,500	1,097,337	1,224,354Expenditure. 		1927.	1928.	1929.	1930.Programmes ...

Transfer to Reserve		10,108 100,000	34,167 100,000	36,425 110,000	4,460 180,000541. It will be seen that apart from capital expenditure amount-ing to  90,000 incurred by the Corporation for purposes other than the regional stations, and excluding depreciation reserve which now stands at about  145,000, the Corporation have accumulated a reserve fund of  490,000.542. The Corporation are incurring capital expenditure on a con-siderable scale. It is understood that at present they are either committed to or contemplate the following capital programme :;  Four regional stations at  140,000 each      ...      560,000 Broadcasting  House,   purchase  of  site  and building ...............      650,000Equipment and furnishing     ...       ...       ...      &quot;200,000Purchase  of   adjacent  site  to  Broadcasting-House   ................      ...        50,0001,460,000
.i 543. To meet this outlay they propose to draw in the first in-/Staiice upon their reserve funds and future revenue surpluses; the balance will be provided by loans, and it is understood they have concluded an arrangement for borrowing of  500,000 for the purpose.544. One cannot fail to be struck by the contrast between the general state of the national finances and the financial position of this&apos; national corporation. We believe it will be generally agreed that measured by any ordinary standards of public entertainment the facilities afforded represent good value for the small annual licence payment of 10s.545. Here is a service which by virtue of the establishment of a state monopoly enables the State to obtain much needed supple-mentary revenue without giving rise to, the sense of grievance engendered by most taxation. The principle of the State draw-ing this revenue, whether it be deemed the profits of a monopoly like the earnings of the Post Office from postal services or analogous to the, entertainments tax, is already decided. The question we ask ourselves is whether in present circumstances this revenue should not be increased instead of continuing in force the original agree-ment under which the bulk of the increase in licence fees is being assigned to improvements in the broadcasting service.546. We recognise that without at the same time a reduction of facilities, any substantial benefit can only accrue to the Exchequer if the Corporation, are enabled by some form of statutory guarantee to spread their present heavy capital expenditure over a period reasonably comparable with the anticipated effective life of the asset. As the charter of the Corporation is due to expire in December, 1936, it cannot offer security for repayment of any loan after that date. We consider that as part of the revised allocation of revenue suggested below a statutory guarantee of payment of loan charges might properly be given in respect of capital expenditure approved as reasonable by the Postmaster General.547. On the above figures of licence duties collections the pay-merit to the British Broadcasting Corporation in the next year is likely to reach  1,380,000. In addition the Corporation have a depreciation reserve of . 145,000 and other reserve funds of  490,000 -which are rapidly being added to. If capital expenditure were provided for by a definite loan charge, the interest on these funds . and the revenue from publications seem likely to bring next year&apos;s revenue tp about  1,600,000, and there is no indication as yet of a slackening off in the rate of growth.
548. On the expenditure side a maintenance of expenditure at the 1930 level would require about  1,040,000. Even if one assumes that capital expenditure to the whole extent adumbrated above were approved, amortisation of the loans on London property over 30 years and on equipment and furnishing for the four regional stations over 15 years would only require about  120,000, or a total outgoing of  1,160,000. This amount is nearly 50 per cent, in excess of the income of  800,000 originally contemplated as adequate to meet requirements. On these figures we think that the allocation of a licence revenue to the Corporation might reasonably be reduced next year to  900,000 bringing the total revenue, including  220,000 from publications, etc., down to about  1,120,000. Pending further increase of revenue the invested reserve funds would be available to meet any temporary deficits on annual working.549. We recommend that the percentages of allocation of revenue to the British Broadcasting Corporation be revised so as to yield this result by making the proportion of net licence duties (after deducting costs of collection as at present) to be paid to the British Broadcasting Corporation as follows: On the 1st million licences ...     80 per cent.On the 2nd million licences       .....      60 per cent.On the 3rd million licences        ......     40 per cent.all in excess of 3 millions.........     20 per cent.This scale calculated on the 4,100,000 licences estimated for this year would yield next year a licence revenue just over  900,000. The gain to the Exchequer would be about  475,000 for the year rising with any further growth in the licence duties.3. EXCHEQUER CONTRIBUTIONS TO LOCAL REVENUES.550. Provision is made in the Civil Estimates (Class X Votes 1 and 2) for the payment to Local Authorities in Great Britain of Exchequer Grants on the basis presciibed by Part VI of the Local Government Act, 1929, and Part III of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929. By these Acts important alterations were made in the financial relations between the Exchequer and Local Authorities, and in the administration of Local Government. The principal alterations were : -(i) Boards of Guardians in England and Wales and Parish Councils in Scotland were abolished and the administration of the Poor Law was transferred to the Councils of Counties and County Boroughs (in Scotland large Burghs) as from 1st April, 1930.   (16th May, 1930, in Scotland.)
(ii) The administration of all highways in Rural Districts and of certain highways in Boroughs and other Urban Dis-&apos; tricts forming part of Administrative Counties (other than London) (in Scotland small Burghs) was transferred to the County Councils as from the same dates.(iii) In Scotland the administration of education was trans-ferred at the same time from ad hoc authorities to the councils of counties and large burghs and there was a large measure of consolidation of the public health activities of minor authori-ties in the hands of these Councils.(iv) Part V of the English Act and Part II of the Scottisli Act contain what are popularly known as the &quot; derating provisions &quot; to which reference has already been made in Chapter V, page 110.(v) Finally the old system of Assigned Revenues was abolished and the percentage grants from the Exchequer for health services as well as certain maintenance grants from the Road Fund were discontinued as from 31st March, 1930, (or 15th May, 1930), and a new system of Exchequer grants towards local government expenses came into operation..551.   It is unnecessary for us to set out the whole of the elaborate arrangements governing the distribution of these grants but we &apos; would refer to the basis on which the aggregate is determined from time to time.(a). General Exchequer contributions.552. Each year there is to be provided by Parliament, for dis-tribution to Local Authorities in each country, a sum of money called the General Exchequer Contribution. This contribution is fixed, in accordance with a scheme set out in the Act, for a series of years, each such series being called &quot; a fixed grant period &quot;,* The annual amount of the General Exchequer Contribution for the first fixed grant period is the total of the following amounts : (i) An amount equal lo the total &quot; losses on account of rates &quot; arising from the derating provisions of the Act in the standard year, 1928-9.(ii) An amount equal to the total &quot; losses on account of grants &quot; arising from the discontinuance of the grants re-, ferred in (V) above; this also being measured by the pay-ments for the standard year.(iii) An additional amount (specified in the Act) of  5,000.000 (England and Wales),  750,000 (Scotland).The first fixed grant period is a period of 3 years from 1930 ; tho Becoud period is a period of 4 years from 1933 ; each subsequent fixed grant period covers 5 years.
553. The amount of the annual General Exchequer Contribution during the first fixed grant period, i.e., the period, of three years from 1st April (or 16th May), 1930, is provisionally estimated as-follows :  	England and WaleB.	Scotland.	Total.Losses on account of rates Losses on account of grants Additional Money	  22,600,000 16,300,000 5,000,000	  3,295,780 2,039,459 750,000	  25 595,780 18,539,459 5,750,000Total annual General Exchequer Contribution for the first fixed grant period.                          				43,900,000	6,085,239	49,985,239(b) Additional Exchequer Grants.554. Provision is made for Additional Exchequer Grants to ensure that as compared with the standard year (1928-29) each County or County Borough or Barge Burgh area obtains from the new grants a minimum advantage by reason of the Act equivalent to Is. per head of population in 1928. The amount of the Addi-tional Exchequer Grants was provisionally estimated at  550,000 for the first fixed grant period in England and Wales and  7,814 in Scotland.(c) Supplementary Exchequer Grants.555. As part of the gradual process by which the financial changes provided for in the Act are to be brought into operation, there are provisions designed to mitigate any increase of rate poundage which might otherwise arise during the first 19 years in which it is in force and provisionally estimated to cost  1,100,000 per annum in England and Wales and  184,695 in Scotland for the first five years.556. Thus the total liability under this legislation for the first fixed grant period is estimated provisionally at :  	England and Wales.	Scotland.	Total.(a) General  Exchequer Concri-butiou. (6) Additional Exchequer Grants (c) Supplementary    Exchequer Grants.	     . 43,900,000 550,000 1,100,000	  6,085,239 7,816 184,695	  49,985,239 557,816 1,284,695 	45,550,000	6,277,750	51,827,750
Of this amount  6,473,638 is at present charged upon the Road Fund under the two Acts, leaving a net amount of  45,354,112 to be voted. The actual provision in the Estimates for 1931 differs slightly from this figure by reason of it including partial payments in respect of two years.(d) The Revision of the General Exchequer Contribution.557. The Acts prescribe that for each fixed grant period subsequent to the first the additional amount of  5,000,000 and  750,000 included in the General Exchequer Contribution is to be replaced by such sum as Parliament may determine, provided that the additional amount for the second and any subsequent fixed grant period shall be such that the proportion which the amount of the annual General Exchequer Contribution for that fixed grant period bears to the total amount of rate and grant-borne expendi-ture incurred by all authorities for the last year but one of the preceding fixed period shall never be less than the proportion which the annual General Exchequer Contribution for the first fixed grant period bore to the total amount of rate and grant-borne expenditure of the first year of that period. The amount of the General Exchequer Contribution for 1933 onwards and again for 1937 onwards will therefore depend upon the extent to which the expenditure of local authorities as a whole for the year 1931 and 1935 respectively exceeds the expenditure of local authorities for the year 1930. Broadly speaking, under these arrangements strictly applied, the total Exchequer contribution will rise or fall at the periodical revisions by about one-fourth of the variation in the aggregate expenditure of local authorities.558. This establishes a general interdependence of national and local finance additional to that already existing in the grant arrangements applicable to particular services (whether these take the form of percentage grants as with education, police, roads and unemployment schemes, or grants per unit of service as with house-building), and in considering the future course of national com-commitments we must have regard therefore also to the general trend of local expenditure. Indeed any review of the burden of public expenditure would otherwise be incomplete.559. The net revenue expenditure of local authorities in England and Wales (charged on rates and Exchequer grants) reached a peak of over  243,500,000 in 1921 and then under the influence of the national pressure for economy fell rapidly.   In 1924 .i move-
ment in the reverse direction set in. The following table gives the figures up to. 1927,-8 :-        ................ - ;     ,Year- &apos;   Expenditure falling onrates and grants.

This is an increase of 26 per cent, in the space of 6 years. Estimates of the amount raised by rates, or contributed by the State in the form of increased grants under the Local Government Act, have recently been published showing an increase between 1927 and 1930 of over  11,000,000. In addition the Ex-chequer grants to local authorities for education, reads and police were all increased during these years.560. This rapid growth of local expenditure since 1923 has occurred notwithstanding that (owing ho doubt to the operation of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme) the number of persons in receipt of poor relief fell from : on 31st March, 1922  ...       ...       ...       1,465,599and on 31st March, 1923 ...       ...       ...       1,345,634to on 31st March, 1928 ......       ... 1,183,088on 31st March, 1929......... 1,106,673on 31st March, 1930 ...       ...       ... 1,047,026and on 31st March, 1931 .......... 1,029,114561. Moreover, as in tfhe case of the national expenditure, the revenue account does not show the full seriousness of the position. Between 31st March, 1921, and 31st March, 1928, the total capital indebtedness of local authorities in England and Wales (after deducting amounts standing to the credit of sinking funds) rose from  595,500,000 to  1,051,500,000, an increase of  456,000,000, or an average of  65:000,000 a year.   This represents the net excess of* Poor-law expenditure in 1926 was exceptionally heavy owing to industrial disputes.
Increased capital expenditure over repayments of. loans. The amount actually spent on capital account in 1927 was  120,000,000. We recognise that the debt1 of local authorities ic very different in character from the national debt in that it is offset in far greater degree by valuable assets. One-fifth of the increase of 456,000,000 was in respect of trading services; housing accounted for well over half the increase and the gross indebtedness of local authorities under this head alone (including  39,400,000 advanced to other parties) stood at  383,000,000 on 31st March 1928.This figure of course includes the estimated future capital liability of the State in respect of housing schemes given on pages 181 and 189. We have no reason ito think that the growth of local authorities&apos; indebtedness has proceeded at any reduced rate since 1927. Such information &apos;as is available points irather to an acceleration.562. We view with grave concern this rapid rise of expenditure of local authorities both on the capital and on the revenue side during a period of falling prices and small growth of the popula-tion. We recognise that in certain areas the movements of popu-lation have caused heavy demands on the local authorities for in-creased expenditure on municipal services and we do not question the necessity for the increased expenditure in such cases. We are also aware of the pressure that has been put upon local authorities in recent years by the Central Government to increase their ex-penditure on certain services. Nevertheless taking the country as a whole the fact remains that in the local as in the national field we have been piling up public burdens. We have been appointed only to review the national expenditure. At the same time we are glad to learn that some local authorities, recognising the serious-ness of the position, have appointed similar committees to survey their own expenditure and recommend reductions where possible. We would earnestly commend this policy to the attention of every authority in the country.563. Notwithstanding the extent to which increased State assist-ance to local authorities has contributed to the present difficulties of the Exchequer, we have endeavoured throughout our search for economies to avoid a mere transference of burden from taxes to rates, realizing full well that rates represent on the whole a less -equitable impost than the national.taxes. In a few cases, in order to achieve the object we had in view, we have been unable to avoid throwing some extra charge upon the rates, but such charges should be trivial in any but the wealthier areas and we do not doubt that if local authorities undertake a careful review of their expendi-ture suggested above, the net result will be a substantial relief to the ratepayer with beneficial reactions in the national exchequer.
chapter viii.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION. 1. Summary of Recommendations.564. In our opening chapter, we came to the conclusion that the anticipated borrowing in 1932 on behalf of &quot;the Unemployment Insurance Fund and the Road Fund should be regarded as a-revenue liability, and on this basis we estimated that to produce a properly balanced budget in 1932, including the usual provision for the redemption of debt, a deficiency of  120,000,000 had to be made good by new taxation or by economies.564a. We now summarise the financial effect of our more im-portant recommendations and indicate how far they suffice to bridge this gap.We divide our list into two parts. In the former we show the financial effect of those which will effect a reduction in charges expected under existing policy in 1932. The full effect of our re-commendations will not be felt in all cases in that year. Neverthe-less we think it better to give the saving which will be realised in the first full year of their operation. In the second part of our list, we give those recommendations whose effect will be to limit future increases of expenditure rather than to secure immediate reduction. In most cases in the latter list it is impossible to express the saving to be expected therefrom as a definite figure.Major Recommendations involving immediate saving.Saving to Exchequer -  in a, full year.Chapter III.

Conclusion.565. In submitting these recommendations for reductions of expenditure we have proceeded on three general principles which it.may be convenient to summarize here i (1) that the rise in the value of money in recent years pro-vides a strong prima facie case for the revision of money obligations fixed under other conditions. In considering the emoluments of public servants we have also had regard to the principle of &quot; fair wages &quot;.(ii) that existing financial difficulties make it necessary for the nation like the private individual to consider seriously what it can afford and not merely what is desirable. Reviewed from this standpoint much expenditure is unwarrantable at the present time, which, under more favourable conditions, we should deem justifiable and even a wise investment of the national resources.(iii) that only by the strictest regard to economy and efficiency over a long period can the trade of the country be restored to its pre-war prosperity and any substantial number of tho unemployed be re-absorbed into industry.566. Wo believe that the wfiole of our recommendations are in accord with these principles and in the terms of the resolution of the House of Commons wc regard them as&quot; practicable and
673legitimate reductions in the national expenditure consistent with the efficiency of the services &quot;. Many of them are clearly inter-dependent : even the more drastic will, we think, be accepted as fair if the whole programme be carried into effect. But if a policy of selection be adopted, if economies are only attempted where little opposition is anticipated, if certain classes are called upon in the national interest to suffer serious reduction of emoluments while large unprofitable expenditure goes on unchecked in other fields, resentment and opposition will be aroused and the eventual result in savings will be negligible; the object of our appointment will remain unfulfilled.567. What are the alternatives to the reductions we suggest? The nation can continue as at present borrowing to meet current requirements and deluding itself that by still showing a sinking fund item in the national accounts it is not .only meeting its lia-bilities but actually paying off debt. This course will lead inevit-ably to an intensification of the financial difficulties until the day comes when far greater sacrifices than those we suggest are forced upon the country. The other method is to endeavour to right the position solely by means of additional taxation, but to achieve a truly balanced budget next year in this way the extra taxation would need to be very heavy and we fear the consequences. The margin of safety is already narrow. Who knows whether the future may not have further troubles in store for us that will make that reserve of financial strength of inestimable value?568. Even under our proposals the risk of additional taxation is not entirely obviated. We set ourselves the task of covering a prospective deficiency next year of  120,000,000. The savings arising from our recommendations only total about  96,500,000 for the first year of their full operation. While their general re-actions should lead to a greater saving in later years, even this amount of  96,500,000 would not be wholly available in 1932 owing to the inevitable delay in making some decisions fully operative.569. How the gap of  20,000,000- 30,000,000 is to be bridged is a difficult question raising issues so much beyond our sphere that we cannot submit any definite recommendation. If in view of the present economic position it were possible to arrange that all classes of the Community should suffer an all round reduction of income, whether derived from earnings, in order to bring costs of production down to a lower level, or investments, we should have no hesitation in proposing that all public Servants and pensioners, Municipal as well as State, of whatever grade or kind, old age pensioners, widows and war pensioners, should share in the re-duction, including those whose pay had already been reduced in
570. Failing the economy from an all-round reduction of incomes, therefore, the alternative is some additional taxation. We do not favour imposing any further burden on productive industry (beyond the small increase in the contributions for unemployment insurance) as this would impede trade recovery, but we are not without hope that the sum required can be found by revisions of general taxation which are free from this objection. In one way or the other we trust that it will be found possible to supplement the economies we recommend sufficiently to surmount immediate financial difficulties.571. Our chief concern however is for the future. If action is limited to these adjustments of expenditure or income, experience since the War does not allow us to hope for that sustained effort for national economy which we regard as essential to the restoration of prosperity. Some further action is needed if retrenchment is not soon to give way once more to expansion as has happened twice in the short period since the War. We have no recommendations to make for improving the machinery of Treasury control. The pro-cedure of Parliament and the relation of Parliament to the Executive are matters rather outside our province and in any case are being examined by a Select Committee. We think however that it would be of definite advantage if a comprehensive review of the financial position could be given to Parliament and through it to the nation, more frequently than on the opening of the annual budget. Particularly is such a review desirable shortly, before the dissolution of a Parliament and soon after the assembly of a new House of Commons. These reviews should cover not merely the current financial year but should take account of the next few years, giving full information also as to the growth of long term commit-ments. A statement of future obligations of the State distinguishing between liabilities in respect of capital expenditure already incurred e.g. grants for housing, roads, unemployment works, etc. and liabilities in respect of continuing pension schemes including pensions to public servants and national pension schemes would be a valuable addition to the tables presented to Parliament in con-nection with the Budget Statement.572. In the case of the Cabinet we suggest that in the detailed and exhaustive consideration which has to take place before items of Government policy can be put into force financial implications should have greater weight. At present the Chancellor of tho Exchequer seems alone among his colleagues to be regarded as charged with responsibility for financial policy.   While ho doubt
he is able to enlist some&quot; support within the Cabinet no organised machinery exists whereby he can be assisted in his difficult task. We suggest that on the analogy of the Committee of Imperial Defence which is working successfully to secure full co-ordination in matters affecting the national defence, there should be a standing Finance Committee of the Cabinet (such as we understand existed under the Coalition Government) wmich would be kept fully in-formed of the state of national revenue and expenditure and wrould examine all schemes submitted to the Cabinet, which involved serious outlay, not merely on their individual merits but from the wider point of view of their bearing on national finance. We have in mind, that the Committee would, like the Committee of Imperial Defence, be elastic in its constitution to permit the calling into council of any advisers it thought fit, and that it would normally consist of the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer and a small number of Ministers selected not so much by reason of the offices they hold as of their aptitude for the difficult task of financial appreciation and criticism.5*73. But the best devised machinery of financial control will be of little avail if the will to control be absent. The root cause of our financial difficulties since the war is that the machinery has been largely nullified in its operation. It has secured the utmost regularity in Government accounting and high standards of administration and organisation, but as regards major items of policy where the real expense of Government lies the machinery of control has again and again been put out of action before it has had any chance of functioning.574. We referred in our opening chapter to the political develop-ments since the war which have resulted in Members of Parlia-ment and Governments being returned to Westminster pledged in advance to vast and expensive schemes. The electoral programme of each successive Party in power, particularly where it was formerly in opposition, has usually been prepared with more regard to attract-ing electoral support than to a careful balancing of national in-terests. When the time comes to put that programme into force, matters which had formerly appeared easy and attractive are found to involve such grave questions as whether the proposals are administratively possible, whether they will have the desired re-results, whether the country can bear the cost; whether, in short, they are really in the national interest. It is -almost inevitable that a new Cabinet should find itself driven to the conclusion that many of its promised reforms ought hot to proceed, but it has a difficult course to steer before it can persuade its supporters in the House to recognise this in view of &quot;their pledges so freely given to the electorate. The problem is a serious one and it is hardly for us to suggest a solution: yet a solution has to&apos;be found if democracy is not to suffer shipwreck on the hard rock of finance. 1

Reservation by Sir Mark Webster Jenkinson.I differ from the views expressed by my colleagues in Paras. 22&quot; and 574 that &quot; the root cause of our financial difficulties since the War &quot; is due to &quot; political developments . . . which have resulted in Members of Parliament and Governments being returned to Westminster pledged in advance to vast and expensive schemes &apos;&apos;, and that &apos;&apos; the electoral programme of the Party in power . . . has usually been prepared with more regard to attracting electoral support than to a careful balancing of national interests &quot;. -    .It is true that during recent years a tendency has grown up among all classes to rely upon the State to subsidize projects of varying National importance, and that the zeal of those who ad-vocate expensive schemes of social reform may outrun their know-ledge of the financial ability of the country to bear the burden.At the same time I have sufficient faith in Parliament to believe that no Party entrusted with the reins of Government would deliberately jeopardize the National Finances merely to honour &apos;&apos; the lavish promises contained in election addresses &apos;&apos;.The following causes have, in my view contributed to the present position: (1) Successive Governments have, without true apprecia-tion of the economic position of the country and the financial problems arising from the war and from world conditions, embarked upon expenditure on Social reforms; granted con-cessions to various classes of State employees; undertaken obligations to local authorities; and followed a course of in-creased National Expenditure, failing to take into account the cumulative financial effect of their action.(2) The rapid growth in the activities and expenditure of certain Government Departments is partly attributable to the natural desire of those responsible for the policy and adminis-tration of those Departments to attain the maximum of accomplishment irrespective of financial considerations; and as results in a Government service can only be measured by achievements and not, as in a commercial concern, by profits earned, there is no incentive to economy.(3) Although Parliament has the opportunity to review the annual estimates in the House which estimates are sub-mitted in the greatest detail instead of examining the ex-penditure proposed with a view to reduction, the occasion is used to urge the Government to further expenditure or to ventilate grievances.
The control of the National Expenditure is vested to-day in : (a) The Treasury(b) The Government(c) The House of Commonshut the supreme control rests with the last named.No Chancellor of the Exchequer, no Government Department, no Committee on National Expenditure, can secure that measure of economy that financial considerations now render so imperative unless the House of Commons is determined that the necessary savings shall be effected.M. WEBSTER JENKINSON.
minority  report.To the Rt. Hon. Philip Snowden, M.P., Chancellor of the Exchequer, Whitehall, S.W.I.Sib,1. Having regard to the measure of our disagreement with the majority of the Committee on several important aspects of public expenditure, we regret we are unable to sign the main report and feel it incumbent upon us to set forth in a separate report the reasons for these divergencies of opinion.2. We consider that in any proper estimation of the possible and actual results of the Committee&apos;s work, its genesis cannot be entirely overlooked. The appointment of the Committee arose out of the acceptance by the Government on the 11th February, 1931, of an amendment to a, direct motion of censure on the subject of public expenditure moved by the major Opposition, and the House of Commons passed by 468 to 21 the following resolution : &quot; That this House consider that, having regard ,to the present burden of Taxation in restricting industry and employ-ment, the Government should at once appoint a small and independent committee to make recommendations to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for effecting forthwith all prac-ticable and legitimate reductions in the national expenditure consistent with the efficiency of the services.&quot;3. From a reading of the debate which preceded this resolution it is apparent there was considerable doubt in the minds of many Members of Parliament as to the possibility of a Committee effect-ing any large measure of economy; and at an early stage in the work of the Committee it became abundantly clear that these doubts were well founded and accurately adumbrated the limita-tions upon securing economy in expenditure unless the enlarging policies of successive Governments and Parliaments were to be severely modified or abandoned. Since the appointment of the Committee, Parliament has approved further measures calling for additional expenditure of varying orders of magnitude. Thus the road to reduced expenditure is largely closed by policies to which the country is committed and outside that domain there remains only the narrow field of administrative and like expenditure.4. The differences apparent amongst those who comprise the House of Commons as to the sources available for effecting real
national economy were not absent from the Committee, and they involve fundamental questions of principle and of social policy to which regard must be paid if proper consideration is to be given not merely to the measure of expenditure, but equally to the manner in which it is being utilised and the extent to which it is being applied for the general well-being. Viewed from that stand-point, it is to us a matter of profound satisfaction to find that of that part of the national expenditure coming within our terms of reference there has been a growing tendency towards the applica-tion of an increasing proportion to purposes of the highest social and economic value, and with what care and efficiency on the whole the public services are being administered.5. While we fully share the desire of our colleagues to secure means for the proper control and wise expenditure of public funds, we entirely disagree with the implications contained in their review of the course of national finance since the War as set forth in section 4, of chapter 1, of the main Report under &quot; Factors, Political and Economic, in the Present Situation.&quot; We do not question the need for caution in undertaking financial eommit-ments of a continuing or other character, but we consider that their picture is over-painted and would represent a condition of financial irresponsibility which in fact does not exist. So far as their strictures concern the principle of ultimate financial responsi-bility, what they regard as &quot; undesirable,&quot; we view as consistent with the right and proper course of democratic government and progress. How otherwise shall the people obtain legislative re-dress of social and economic injustice except through those who seek their suffrage?6. The results arising from the past inequitable distribution of the national income were not generally recognised until the nation became involved in a disastrous war, when the whole resources of man-power and of material had to be strained to the utmost to enable the country to meet a grave crisis, and when it was dis-covered that despite the rapid growth of wealth and prosperity, the human factor had attained to nothing more than what was described as a C3 standard. It is a matter for gratifica-tion that in the post-war years, and despite the difficulties exist-ing, all political parties in different degrees have recognised an obligation in this respect, and that each in turn has been anxious in varying measure to show appreciation of the necessity for utilising a larger proportion of the national income for the pur-pose of remedying the evil results of past neglect. Much remains to be done, and much more might be done now but for the dead-weight burden of war debt which absorbs so large a share of the national income and the heavy expenditure involved in the apparent necessity for providing against future wars. Allowing for these, it may be truly said that in the main State policy has been one of a wise use of the funds collected by taxation.
national economy were not absent from the Committee, and they involve fundamental questions of principle and of social policy to which regard must be paid if proper consideration is to be given not merely to the measure of expenditure, but equally to the manner in which it is being utilised and the extent to which it is being applied for the general well-being. Viewed from that stand-point, it is to us a matter of profound satisfaction to find that of that part of the national expenditure coming within our terms of reference there has been a growing tendency towards the applica-tion of an increasing proportion to purposes of the highest social and economic value, and with what care and efficiency on the whole the public services are being administered.5. While we fully share the desire of our colleagues to secure means for the proper control and wise expenditure of public funds, we entirely disagree with the implications contained in their review of the course of national finance since the War as set forth in section 4, of chapter 1, of the main Report under &quot; Factors, Political and Economic, in the Present Situation.&quot; We do not question the need for caution in undertaking financial commit-ments of a continuing or other character, but we consider that their picture is over-painted and would represent a condition of financial irresponsibility which in fact does not exist. So far as their strictures concern the principle of ultimate financial responsi-bility, what they regard as &quot; undesirable,&quot; we view as consistent with the right and proper course of democratic government and progress. How otherwise shall the people obtain legislative re-dress of social and economic injustice except through those who seek their suffrage ?6. The results arising from the past inequitable distribution of the national income were not generally recognised until the nation became involved in a disastrous war, when the whole resources of man-power and of material had to be strained to the utmost to enable the country to meet a grave crisis, and when it was dis-covered that despite the rapid growth of wealth and prosperity, the human factor had attained to nothing more than what was described as a C3 standard. It is a matter for gratifica-tion that in the post-war years, and despite the difficulties exist-ing, all political parties in different degrees have recognised an obligation in this respect, and that each in turn has been anxious in varying measure to show appreciation of the necessity for utilising a lai-ger proportion of the national income for the pur-pose of remedying the evil results of past neglect. Much remains to be done, and much more might be done now but for the dead-weight burden of war debt which absorbs so large a share of the national income and the heavy expenditure involved in the apparent necessity for providing against future wars. Allowing for these, it may be truly said that in the main State policy has been one of a wise use of the funds collected by taxation.
7. Public expenditure has ample justification when it rests primarily upon the necessity for re-adjusting the use of the national income in such manner as to transfer expenditure from less essential or desirable channels into those which are designed to mitigate social injustices, or those which improve the economic structure of the nation. The growth of social services is a natural corollary to the development of industry and commerce and it cannot be denied that these have profited materially from services often narrowly regarded as amenities, and it is not an overstatement of the case to say that improved health and sanitation, better education, wider and cleaner roads, quicker communications and even open spaces and playing fields are essential to modern large scale industry.8. In this connection, it is arguable that the drift of the newer industries to the less congested South is not unrelated to the fact that these social services are more generally available at less cost than in older industrial districts still handicapped by the neglect of the past or the accumulated cost of remedying that neglect. In consequence of the re-settlement of industry now taking place and the world changes particularly affecting the basic industries of this country, a new intersection of the nation is becoming apparent, dividing on lines of comparative poverty and wealth the distressed industrial North&quot; and other parts from the more prosperous South. It is a matter for serious consideration whether money now being spent in improving facilities in the South would not be more profit-ably employed in reviving districts already possessing industrial equipment, but lacking those services and facilities which render the better designed and more spaciously planned South so powerful an attraction to those establishing new industries in this country.9. The existing social services have been slowly built up with the general approval of all citizens of goodwill and vision, and their essential value is perhaps most clearly demonstrated in the fact that their existence has materially assisted this country to withstand the shock of the unparalleled economic depression, better, perhaps, than any other country in the world. Their true worth in this con-nection will probably only be accurately appreciated when the present period of depression has passed, and it will be possible to view in proper perspective the course of present economic troubles. We can see no special reason why a period of economic difficulty should necessarily be required to bear its own financial burden at the price of scaling down social services, and we do not share the pessimism that discerns signs of only remote recovery. We cannot ignore the fact that the cost in recent years of organised development in the social, as also indeed in the industrial life of the country, largely represents the accumulated liability of an unwise economy of the past, and is only now beginning in any appreciable degree, to eradicate the disastrous consequences of neglect, and of the mal-adjustment of the national wealth during and following the 1090S H s
industrial revolution of the nineteenth century ; and, in our con-sidered judgment, to enter afresh upon a policy of cutting down expenditure which would require this and succeeding generations to pay a like ti*ibute to the cost of the industrial revolution now pro-ceeding would be to add to the burdens of the nation and not to reduce them.10. Much of the national effort is to-day being absorbed outside the realm of public control in forms of wasteful and uneconomic expenditure or in the provision of various forms of luxury which, as regards the latter, while permissible in times of prosperity, can-not be disregarded in the consideration of means to meet the present time of stress.In any event,&apos;we are satisfied that as a principle of sound national economy, before any sacrifice can be called for in a reduction of the social services which represent absolute necessities to the wOrkless citizen, the sick and infirm and the aged, before any action is taken to curtail the provision of decent housing conditions for the people or to retard the educational progress of the children of the nation, there is ample field of exploration for taxation, and for restriction of expenditure in other less justifiable directions.11. During the War many restrictions were applied and accepted as being necessary to the common interest. If to-day another emer-gehcy has arisen, then it is incumbent upon Parliament to intro-duce legislation to secure that the sacrifice necessary to meet it shall be common to all and in proportion to the ability to bear the burden.With the foregoing considerations in mind, we turn to the task placed upon the Committee.I. The Field for Economy in National Expenditure.12. The Committee were appointed on the 17th March, 1931. after consultation between all parties. Their orders of reference, in terms identical with those of the Committee on National Expendi-ture set up in 1922, and known as the &quot; Geddes &quot; Committee, were as follows : &quot; To make r-recommendations to the Chancellor of the Ex-chequer for effecting forthwith all possible reductions in the National Expenditure on Supply Services, having regard especi-ally to the present and prospective position of the Revenue. In so far as questions of policy are involved in the expenditure under discussion, these will remain for the exclusive considera-tion of the Cabinet; but it will be open to the Committee to review the expenditure and to indicate the economies which might be effected if particular policies were either adopted, abandoned or modified.&quot;13. If, as the G-eddes Committee stated, the task assigned to them was one of complexity, that placed upon the present Com-mittee has been even more difficult.   The former Committee dealt
with an expenditure which still reflected in a very considerable degree the extravagant policy and ways of the war period, as well as the hopes and expectations of the peace, stimulated by the short-lived boom of the immediate post-war years. No like oppor-tunity has offered itself to the present Committee. Of the  175,000,000 reduction the Geddes Committee were charged to secure, no less a sum than  75,000,000 was provided by Govern-ment Departments in response to a Treasury circular on the subject of the restriction of public expenditure, and the fact that the sum so saved was largely in respect of special expenditure on services arising out of the war is an indication of the resources of saving available at that time. With regard to the  100,000,000 which remained to be found, close on  60,000,000 was recom-mended as being available from the Defence Forces, the expendi-ture on which had been enormously swollen by the war.14. Since 1922, and apart from the continuous survey by th&amp; Select Committee on Estimates and the Public Accounts Committee, other Special Committees have examined many branches of national expenditure. These include the Anderson Committee of 1923 &quot; to enquire into the present standard of remuneration and other con-ditions of employment of the various classes of State servants employed in the Civil Service and in the three Fighting Services &apos;&apos;. The Standing Cabinet Committee, set up by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1925 &quot; to review the estimates of national expendi-ture with a view to making a substantial reduction in the charges on the tax payer &quot;. (The recommendations of this Committee formed, we understand, the basis of the Economy (Miscel-laneous Provisions).Act, 1926). The Colwyn Committee, appointed in 1925 to investigate the expenditure falling upon the navy, army and air force, and this Committee appointed another body to examine into the administration of the Royal Dockyards. The Colwyn Committee subsequently investigated expenditure on edu-catiori. In 1926 and 1927 the Standing Cabinet Committee con-tinued its researches, which resulted in certain departmental econo-mies. In 1927 the Committee under Lord Chalmers considered Police expenditure.15. In addition to the special investigations made by these ad hoc Committees, our enquiries show that provision has been made for a continuous check upon administrative expenditure throughout the various Departments, with the result, we are satis-fied, that effective measures are in general taken to secure the most economical administration consistent with the efficient execution of the duties and responsibilities devolving upon the Departments.16. It will thus be seen that the field of economy in State expenditure is a much trodden one, and our general conclusion is that as regards the particular classes of expenditure coming within the purview of this Committee to effect any serious decrease is10905 H i
impracticable, except by measures which are solely in the control of Parliament itself.Even so information was before us which showed that the position of national expenditure in relation to revenue is one of exceptional difficulty, and that the situation calls for careful scrutiny and super-vision.17. Without detracting from our previous remarks as to the general high standard of supervision of expenditure, we think it may well be found that within the wide and complex framework of national administration and development there are places where, by reorganisation of particular services, duplication of administra-tive costs and possibly of actual expenditure in certain directions may be eliminated without injury to the service itself or its designed object; but as regards the general limitation and re-duction of expenditure it seems to us that other and wider con-siderations arise.18. National expenditure is not necessarily wise or unwise by reference only to its amount, nor to the fact that it is public as distinct from private expenditure. The former, like the latter, must be considered not only from its quantitative but also from its qualitative aspects. It seems to us that real economy in expendi-ture is much more than a simple process of &apos;&apos; lopping-off &apos;&apos;, re-gardless of the loss to the well-being of the nation, and without estimation of whether the amount thus figuratively saved may not be exceeded in lessened national efficiency, on the one hand, or the necessity for future expenditure of an enlarged order, on the other. Thus our dissent from the general point of view expressed by our colleagues in their Report rests upon a conviction that, taking the long view, their recommendations in many respects would not, if carried into effect, achieve real national economy, although they might for the time being secure an actual reduction of expenditure.19. Turning now to an examination of the national expenditure, we find that the sum estimated to meet requirements for the cur-rent year amounts to  884,900,000, or excluding self-balancing services,  803,400,000. Of this,  312,300,000, being the sum charged on the Consolidated Eund, chiefly in respect of interest and management of the national debt, and  52,050,000 Sinking Eund, are outside the Committee&apos;s order of reference, leaving  439,016,000 of supply expenditure to be considered.2. Post-war National Expenditure compared with pre-war. 20. The introductory chapter of the main Report deals somewhat fully with the amount and character of post-war expenditure. We do not, however, feel that a proper perspective can be obtained by a comparison only of one post-war year with another. The follow-ing classification of the several heads of expenditure in comparison with the relative expenditure in 1913 will serve to indicate the directions in which large increases have taken place.

21. Prom the foregoing table, it will be seen that out of a total increase of  633,318,000, no less than  381,498,000 (60.24 per cent.) is on account of Debt, War Pensions, etc., and if there be added the increase in respect of Defence Services  33,334,000 as being generally related to like purposes, the increase is  414,832,000, namely 65.50 per cent, of the total increase. Next in order of increase are the Social Services. To the sum of  99,945,000 there has to be added  12,324,000 increase under grants to local Revenues (i.e.  38,324,000 less  26,000,000 for de-rating), showing a total increase of  112,269,000, namely 17.73 per cent. The increase on Education is  40,263,000, namely 6.35 per cent.22. In any appreciation of 1931-32 figures with those of 1913-14 regard must be paid to the present lower value of money, and the figures given in the above table of 1931-32 expenditure ex-pressed in 1913-14 prices permit of a more accurate comparison. The degrees in which specific classes of national expenditure are responsive to changes in price levels necessarily vary with their different constituents. One fact, however,, emerges, and it is, that by far the largest single item, namely that in respect of Debt Interest and Management, amounting to  302,900,000&apos;, re-mains (subject to actual reduction of debt and conversion operations) fixed in terms of money and its burden increases with any fall in price level.23. Our colleagues comment upon the degree to which national taxation now absorbs the national income as compared with pre-war years, and seek to relate this to the post-war policy of Parlia-ment in matters of expenditure.This, in our judgment, must tend to carry a wrong impression as to the nature of the burden of taxation and its causes.The following table shows :  (a) the percentage distribution of Government expenditure under the various heads for 1913/14, 1929/30, and 1931/32, and(b) the proportion of various heads of Government expendi-ture to national income for 1913/14 and 1929/30.Services	Per (	^ent. of Total.

On the Defence Services the proportion has fallen by .5 per cent. If this item be deducted, then the total increase taken into account in respect of all other services is but 2.74 per cent. On Education the increase is .49 per cent.On a fair consideration of these figures as well as of those which give the distribution of expenditure we cannot accept the view implicit in our colleagues&apos; arguments that there has been an excessive increase in the proportion of the national income applied to social services and education or that they absorb an undue share of the proceeds of national taxation.It is abundantly clear, therefore, that no appreciation of the measure of post-war national expenditure, whether in relation to national income or to national taxation, can be valid which does not take full account of the preponderate proportion of such ex-penditure which arises from the war.24. The following table shows the cost of interest on the internal portion of the National Debt in relation to Budget receipts for the
year 1913/1914, and for each year since the war. It will be noted that although the actual interest charges fell from  308,664,000 in 1920/21 to  272,995,000 (estimated) in 1931/32, the percentage of budget receipts which it absorbs has risen from 22.42 per cent, to 33.02 per cent., and that approximately one-third of all the revenue raised is required for the payment of interest on debt internally held.Internal Debt Interest in Relation to Budget Receipts.Year.

Another aspect of this heavy charge is made plain by the figures given in the further table, which show that although the actual payments of interest on the internal debt fell from  308,664,000 in 1920/21 to  272,995,000 (estimated) in 1931/32, a reduction of  35,669,000, the real cost to the nation in terms of goods and services has risen by  93,970,000, and if the reduction in the annual payment be taken into account then the burden of financing the internal debt has inceased by the equivalent of  114,658,000, or 73 per cent. :-Internal Debt Interest adjusted in Relation to Price Levels.-	Actual Cost.

The consideration of the national expenditure relating to Debt Interest, etc., was outside the purview of the Committee&apos;s work; but, having regard to the large degree in which this charge absorbs national revenue, we have felt justified in making some reference to it, and to the increasing burden which it imposes on the nation as a consequence of the fall in price levels.3. CIVIL SERVICE ADMINISTRATION.(Chapter II. Main Report.)27. We agree with the general summary of facts and the con-clusions arrived at. We have been impressed by the efficiency of the various administrative departments and the degree of control exercised to secure reasonable economy.4.-P4Y AND PENSIONS.(Chapter III. Main Report.)28. We are in agreement with this part of the main report subject to the following reservations : A. Civil Service.Industrial Employees.In the light of the facts and circumstances ascertained we are in accord with the view of our colleagues that the Award of 1924 relating to the employees in the Royal Dockyards and Ordnance Factories should be reconsidered, provided this is carried out through the recognised procedure of negotiation.29. We cannot, however, accept their conception of the &quot; fair wages &apos;&apos; basis when applied to the employees in question by a com-parison with the outside engineering industry a matter which also concerns employees of similar occupations in the public services. The general practice appears to be to regard outside rates as minima; and the &quot; fair wages &quot; principle, as we conceive it in its. application to employment by the State, is that the State as a. model employer should offer such terms as will secure the best service available, the comparison with private employment being
in relation to what the &quot; best &quot; employers in private industry are able to offer for equal service, regard being paid to security of employment and other factors. Further, it appears to us to be essential that the possibility of friction between the State and its servants should be avoided by the existence wherever practicable of an authoritative but. impartial tribunal to secure that the &quot; fair wages &quot; principle is equitably applied.30. Judged by the foregoing criteria, we feel it is open to serious question as to whether the outside engineering industry under pre-sent arrangements with its policy of force majeure as the ultimate means of disposing of questions of wage payment is satisfactory as providing a &quot; fair wages &quot; basis applicable to State employ-ment.31. We would, however, add another and general consideration, which is, that State employment implies a sense of civic respon-sibility which should reflect itself in the relationship between the State and its employees, and that if the State adopts a more liberal policy in the treatment of its servants when the national resources make this practicable, it may reasonably expect that such a policy-will find a reciprocal attitude on the part of those it employs in times of national stress such as now exists.B. Teachers.32. While we agree with the view that an adjustment of the salaries of teachers is justified, we are unable to accept some of the arguments adduced and certain of the conclusions arrived at.33. It appears to us to be perfectly reasonable that the State, being so largely concerned in the results of the settlement of teachers&apos; salaries, should be a party to the negotiations to the extent of placing before the negotiators &quot; the important national financial considerations which arise &quot;, and is entitled to expect that such considerations should be paid full regard to by the negotiating- body. With regard, however, to the suggestion of our colleagues that the pay of teachers, like that of the police, should be fixed by the State, we can see no grounds of justification for determining the joint machinery of negotiation called into existence for the purpose of dealing with the pay and conditions of service of the teachers and which appears in the whole to have worked satisfactorily. The conditions of employment of the police are not closely corn-parable with those of the teachers, having regard to the different functions they perform, and we consider that the requirements of the case would be adequately met if provision were made within the existing machinery for the proper representation of the large financial interest of the State in the pay of teachers.34. While we appreciate that in the recommendations of our colleagues for reducing teachers&apos; salaries it is contemplated that
they will still retain an equivalent to more than double the pre-war average, we think it necessary to comment upon the latter to the extent of saying that an average remuneration of  97 per annum (the pre-war figure) to a profession charged with the respon-sibility for the instruction of the children of the nation, even when regarding is paid to the contribution made by the State to the training of the teachers themselves, is an impossible basis from which to decide what is an equitable salary to be paid and to secure &quot; an orderly and progressive solution of the salary problem in Public Elementary Schools by agreement &quot;.The duties are both exacting and responsible, and in the case of certificated teachers require a training and qualifications of a standard certainly not lower than is expected of those ranks of the Civil Service who are in receipt of measurably comparable salaries.35. While it is difficult to make a close comparison between the teaching profession and other branches of public employment, it seems reasonable to take the average salary as a basis of con-sideration as in the case of the Civil Service. A comparison of all certificated teachers&apos; salaries with the third group of employees in the Civil Service (Executive and Clerical) gives results distinctly favourable to the Civil Service, namely  279 as against  281 4s. We do not, however, overlook the fact that the Civil Service is still subject to the cost of living index figure. On the other hand, the teachers contribute 5 per cent, of their salary to pension provisions. A fair examination of the whole position, with due regard to the &quot; fair wages &quot; principle, would appear to justify consideration of an adjustment of teachers&apos; salaries in the region of 12  per cent. The actual figure, however, is one to be decided through the joint negotiating machinery existing for that purpose.36. In the degree that the existing salaries of secondary and fully employed technical teachers are related to the salaries of elementary teachers, a corresponding adjustment would fall to be made..5. DEFENCE.(Chapter IV.   Main Report.)37. We are in agreement with the Main Report on the general conclusions arrived at with regard to the Army, Navy and Air Force and ancillary services; but in respect of the Naval Dockyards we cannot accept the view of our colleagues as expressed in paragraph 239 on the question of the execution of naval construction work. While it is reasonable that in considering whether such work be undertaken in the Dockyards comparison should be made with the cost if carried out by private firms, any proper comparison designed to secure savings must not overlook the fact that to the extent that construction work ceases to be done in the Dockyards the proportion of fixed overhead charges falling to be borne by the
repair work will rise, and an apparent saving in the one direction may be more than offset in the other. Moreover, the importance in case of emergency of keeping the Dockyards reasonably fully employed must not be overlooked, and if the high standard of efficiency essential in Naval establishments is to be maintained, a policy which seems to contemplate the casualisation of employment in the Dockyards ought not lightly to be entered upon by reason only that from a narrow comparison of particular costs savings may appear to lie in that direction.6. DEVELOPMENT.(Chapter V.   Main Report.)38. We differ from our colleagues&apos; point of view in regard to expenditure on development. We do not question that this ex-penditure must be fairly judged from the standpoint of economic benefit, but we disagree with the opinion implicit in their argu-rnents that economic benefit is possible only if the &quot; test of profit &quot; in the sense used by them be present, or that operations are neces-sarily wasteful where the measure of State assistance exceeds the direct saving in respect of the maintenance of the unemployed. In our qpinion, it is impossible to approve or disapprove expenditure on development by reference to these two factors alone. Other, and, to us, no less important considerations exist.39. We would ourselves judge development expenditure by the broad test of whether it is designed to add to the Capital equipment of the country, to improve its technical and industrial efficiency, and whether having satisfied this desideratum it also provides employment for persons who otherwise would be idle. Nor do we exclude in this connection the improvement of what are often deprecatingly referred to as &quot; amenities &quot;. The provision of swim-ming baths, of roads, which, among other purposes, may facili-tate holiday traffic, can be justified as conducing to economic de-velopment even on a strict utilitarian test as satisfactorily as can much of the nation&apos;s private expenditure in other directions, although this latter may easily discharge the requirement of com-mercial profitability. Nor can the value of development works be narrowly assessed on the basis of immediate or early calculable direct financial return. On the contrary, it may well be that schemes of development requiring several years to carry out and the return from which may be even more remote, will be found to be of the most nationally profitable character.We are of opinion, therefore, that expenditure on development can be justified when devoted to the removal of industrial or social defects or the creation of new capital assets and equipment which will inure to the general betterment of the economy of the nation.
40. The figures of this expenditure as given in the Main Report show it to be large and varied, embracing both Home and Empire Development, and our considered view is that on the whole it is wise expenditure of definite economic benefit. It appears to us that it is especially the time when, as now, much of the resources of the nation both of money and of man-power is compulsorily idle by reason of the disequilibrium in world industry and commerce, that the nation should utilise both money and men for the purpose of renewing its capital equipment and of improving its industrial and social structure.41. A comparison of the cost of maintaining on a bare subsistence-tence basis an unemployed man in idleness with the cost to the State of providing or accelerating work is incomplete and defective unless the value of the work as an addition to or an extension of the nation&apos;s equipment be taken fully into account.Moreover, the idle man is not only a dead loss to the productive power of the community but there is the human waste in morale and self-respect arising from long periods of idleness, the effect upon his domestic economy and the reaction upon his dependants  all of which must be placed in the scale.42. We do not overlook the limitations which exist of providing employment in this way, nor that they are inherent in the present economic system which&quot; is itself unable in times of industrial change and readjustment to provide employment for many who seek it, but we cannot subscribe to the doctrine that development in the sense used here must remain in abeyance unless and until it can be carried out on terms of commercial profitability. On the contrary, the renewal, the remodelling and the re-planning of the economic and social structure of the country is essentially a task which the State, in association with the local authorities and other large organisations, should undertake and, if this be so, it can hardly be doubted that the most favourable occasion is when money and man-power are readily available and can be utilised without the disturbing effects of the withdrawal of either from its normal em-ployment in industry.43. We consider that the &quot; burden &quot; upon industry of State ex-penditure for these purposes is commonly overestimated, and whilst the pressure upon State finances as at present regulated may be con-siderable, the objective and creative character of the expenditure must not be overlooked, nor the additional yield of taxation result-ing from the increased volume of employment provided and the lessened demand upon the State for contributions to the mainten-ance of the unemployed.44. We have referred earlier in our report to the benefits which industry draws from the provision of social services, and it draws
no less benefits from national development. Moreover, money-spent in both cases passes through industry, employs industry, fructifies industry, and there appears to us no sufficient evidence that the money so spent would, in the economic conditions exist-ing since the war, have been utilised for purposes on the whole more beneficial to industry.45. Accordingly, we are not in favour of restricting expenditure on development by reference to the tests sought to be applied by our colleagues. We are, however, inclined to the view that advantage would result from a greater measure of co-ordination of the many activities of the State particularly related to develop-ment; that steps should be taken to remove overlapping or dupli-cation of effort, and where, as is the case with the Road Fund, administrative policy is altered or normal programmes are accele-rated in order to provide employment in development work, these emergency activities should be kept separate and distinguishable from the ordinary working of the service. Indeed, it appears to us that all such activities might with material advantage both of control and of wise economy be co-ordinated into one definite service.46. With these general appreciations of the place of development in the nation&apos;s activities, we record our comments upon the several recommendations of our colleagues upon particular development services : 1. Research.47. We are in agreement with the conclusions in the Main Report so far as these are designed to secure the co-ordination of Research work and improved financial control. We also agree with the desirability of stimulating industry and agriculture to develop their own research activities.2. The Road Fund.48. We are unable to concur in the recommendation that the Road Fund should cease to be treated as a separate self-contained fund, and henceforth be voted as part of the supply expenditure. The advantages claimed for the proposal appear to us to be more theoretical than real. A fully documented report and Statement of Accounts of the fund is annually presented to Parliament : the accounts are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and also to the scrutiny and criticism of the Public Accounts Committee.49. The receipts into the fund arise from taxation originally im-posed in 1909 for specific expenditure designed to facilitate the use and development of the vehicles taxed and not in aid of the general
revenue of the country. The fact that in 1926 and 1927 the cash balances were &quot; raided &quot; to the tune of  7,000,000, and  12,000,000, respectively, for the general relief of the Exchequer did not alter the character or object of this special vehicle taxation, but rather served to emphasise it and to afford Parliament and the country an opportunity of observing that the revenues of the fund were being diverted from their intended pur-poses. The appropriation of these sums clearly cannot be dis-regarded in any consideration of the present necessity of borrowing for the fund, the need for which borrowing arises as a consequence of a definite policy of acceleration of works in relief of unemploy-ment. In addition to these raids, one-third of the taxation on ordinary motor cars and motor-cycles, amounting this year to nearly  5,000,000, has from. March, 1926, been taken as general Exchequer revenue, on the basis, presumably, of a luxury tax upon the owners of such vehicles. Of the remaining revenue, a large proportion is now allocated under Statute (the Local Government Act, 1929, in particular) or is, in effect, charged for maintenance grants, etc., to local highway authorities.50. Both the local highway authorities and the payers of motor vehicle taxation regard-and having in mind the origin and nature of this taxation are, in our view, entitled to regard the Road Fund as an allocated fund for highway and cognate purposes, and would properly object to its diversion into the general revenue receipts of the Exchequer. As a supply service, any future excess of income over expenditure would, ipso facto, be applied annually in relief of general expenditure not related to road and like improvements, and thus, pro tanto, the fund would be systematically raided in relief of general taxation. That these raids would automatically take place as part of normal budgetary operations, and would, therefore, for the most part be unnoticed, does not seem to us to make the proposal any less a fundamental departure from the purposes for which this special taxation was. originally levied and is now paid.51. Furthermore, the separate existence of the Road Fund enables the Minister of Transport, subject to exceptional circumstances, to make reasonably long-term arrangements with the local highway authorities and to encourage the &quot; Programme &quot; policy. If the fund becomes a supply service it will, presumably, be the subject of annual review and argument between the Treasury and the Minister. This, we think, would be bad from the point of view of good administration in the Roads Department : would involve uncertainties in the minds of local highway authorities : would militate against well-thought out highway policy, and would not result in ultimate economy.52. As to the proposal for a limitation of expenditure in imme-diate future years, we are inclined to the view that because, as.
we understand, road and like expenditure has been regarded as affording means of providing a greater measure of employment more rapidly than other works, the promotion and acceleration of road programmes has been looked at too much from that aspect and too little, perhaps, from that of present need or of immediate cost. While we think it would be difficult to designate any par-ticular road as serving pleasure, more than other, traffic; or, if it were possible, to say that the cost of such road is therefore uneco-nomic, we feel that there are substantial grounds for the general opinion that the development of arterial roads has reached a point where, in present financial circumstances, a slowing down might take place without serious disadvantage. The degree in which this may be possible is necessarily related to present commitments and the merits of particular schemes. It appears to us that the rapid acceleration of the trunk roads programme and the Five Year programme of works may be found to have intensified the problem of road congestion in the large Cities and Towns and their adjoin-ing Urban areas, thus accentuating the need for street improve-ment in those areas, with consequent earlier, if not, additional expenditure. We are aware that the employment capacity is much less on improvement schemes than on main road schemes in rela-tion to the total cost, because of the large compensation generally to be paid in respect of the former; but we cannot help feeling that the problem of improving traffic facilities would be assisted by a reconsideration and re-alignment of the present policy with special regard to congested areas.53. We have considered the information placed before us as to the present standard of maintenance, and we are unable to conclude that it is generally higher than is necessary. We understand that the expenditure on road maintenance is carefully checked, and every effort is made to reduce the cost within the limit of avoidance of subsequent additional expense. We doubt, therefore, whether the general lowering of the standard of maintenance of the roads would, in the long run, prove to be economical.54. Whilst we agree with our Colleagues that a more extended view should be taken of the future finance of London traffic facilities, we do not share their outlook that what can be afforded is necessarily related to a given rate of expenditure. The London traffic problem has reached a state when the direct and indirect loss arising from congestion is such as to require full enquiry whether its continuation can long be afforded. We do not ignore the fact that London&apos;s problem in this respect is not only that of London&apos;s traffic. With respect to the Charing Cross Bridge Scheme, this we think must be viewed as a part of the whole problem, but if it can be shown that the contemplated outlay could be used to greater economic advantage, whether in relation to London&apos;s traffic problem or otherwise, the Ministry of Transport and the
Treasury will have the opportunity, if and when the scheme is again submitted to Parliament, of dealing with the expenditure aspect of it, and we do not doubt that the requirements of the present financial position as well as other factors will be taken into account in the consideration by those Departments as well as by Parliament itself.55. We appreciate that in regard to the Charing Cross Bridge Scheme, the preponderate proportion of its cost will be on account of compensation and not of works, and that under existing cir-cumstances compensation is inescapably a large contributory factor in the cost of London street improvements.(3) Department of Overseas Trade.56. We agree that it is reasonable that those who utilise the services of the Department upon matters of direct and particular interest to themselves should pay for such. We understand that where the cost is capable of approximate ascertainment an appro-priate charge is made, and it may well be that this policy is capable of extension, or that the charges now made could be fairly increased, and if.so, we consider such should be done. We are in some doubt, however, as to whether the general services, the increasing value and extent of which is more and more being realised and acknowledged by the trading interests of the country, could effectively be put upon a charge basis^ or that, if they were, the revenue resulting would be sufficient to make the Department self-supporting. Bearing in mind the large measure of support and assistance given by competitive countries in the direction of fostering the trade of their nationals and the need in this respect, as well as in others of placing the traders and manufacturers of this country as nearly on a parity as is possible, we are unable to agree that it would be wise to discontinue the Department on the grounds only that it cannot be made self-supporting.(5) Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.57. We agree with our colleagues&apos; conclusions and recommenda-tkrns with the following exception :  (D Land Drainage and Water Supply, etc.Recommendation (b). We regard the proposed normal limitation of grant to the estimated saving to the State in the maintenance of the unemployed as an impossible basis of fixing State aid to drainage schemes. Nor do we think it would, if desirable, prove to be practicable.6. Department of Agriculture (Scotland).58. Bearing in mind that the Scottish Drainage Act was passed as recently as 1930, when the necessity for this differential treat-
ment was doubtless justified on the facts, and as no sufficient evidence has been submitted to us to show that the situation has since changed, we find ourselves unable to support the recom-mendation.7. Development Fund.59. We agree with the main Report on this matter.8. Beet Sugar Industry Great Britain.60. Having regard to the contractual obligations under the Beet Sugar (Subsidy) Act, 1925, which does not expire until 1934, we can only concur in the comments of our colleagues and express the hope that the whole matter may then be fully and exhaustively reviewed.61. We are unable to resist the feeling that the very considerable State assistance given by way of subsidy and duty preferences to this particular industry has failed to achieve commensurate results. While it may be that this is in some degree due to the steep fall in the world price of sugar, we consider that the reason is to be found more in the manner in which the assistance has been given and the large extent to which it has been applied towards the liberal remuneration of capital, when other important basic industries of the country have had to be content with a much lower return or no return at all.Home grown beet sugar in 1930 represented only about 20 per cent, of the total consumption of the United Kingdom, whilst about one-third was cane sugar from Empire sources. And it ought not to be overlooked that at the same time as the State, by large sub-subsidies, is stimulating the production of home-grown beet sugar, the national finances are also being called upon to provide assistance to certain cane sugar producing Colonies, where, owing to the contraction of the markets for their sugar, distress is so prevalent that local revenues, unaided, are unable to cope with it. The competition of home-grown beet sugar, assisted by large annual subsidies and other reliefs, is a factor, though perhaps a small one, in this state of affairs, and is we feel worthy of attention.9. Forestry Commission.62. This is particularly one of those forms of development which must necessarily be done by the State if serious attention is to be given to it at all. Its value cannot be judged from a purely com-mercial standpoint, and the Commissioners have ample justification for the attitude they have adopted towards their functions when they state that &apos;\the object of afforestation is not to provide a remunerative investment for State funds, but to meet certain de-ficiencies in the economic organisation of the country which other-wise would not be made good.&quot;
68763. It was represented to the Committee that one of the con-siderations in mind when the present scheme was started was the bulky nature of timber as an import and its consequent heavy demands on tonnage. As a factor to be taken into account in the event of war, the necessity to import timber would be a serious consideration having regard to past experience, which showed that as much tonnage had to be devoted to timber as to food imports.64. Another important feature, however, is that excessive forest depletion is at present going on in most parts of the world without adequate replacement by new planting, and considerable concern is felt as to the future of supplies. In Great Britain, with the break-up of estates, woods are being felled and not re-planted. That process is likely to be accelerated and the work of the Commission remained as one of the few efforts to reconstitute rural Britain.While the unplanted land already held by the Commission is 173,000 acres, in spite of this reserve their present programme of planting could only be carried on if further lands were acquired. In the absence of new acquisitions, their planting programme must fall from 25,500 acres in 1931 to 17,000 acres in 1936.The Commission are obtaining land on favourable terms and they do not anticipate that there is any prospect of a further fall in value which on that ground would make it economic to avoid further purchases at the present time.65. On the request of the Committee the Commissioners sub-mitted various schemes indicative of the effect of limiting in varying degrees their activities over the next five years&apos; period in comparison with the present scale of operations. The recommen-dations in the Main Report would, it appears, involve the gradual abandonment of any considered forest policy, and we are unable to support the same. Further, while we agree that from the point of view of providing direct employment the results obtainable from afforestation are not very substantial, it is a consideration that under the recommendations of our colleagues 1,700 workers would be paid off and to a great degree must become chargeable upon the National Insurance funds. Moreover, in that connection it must not be overlooked that this country imports timber products to a value of between  40,000,000 and  50,000,000 per annum, a large amount of which is finished material.66. The Commissioners state that the outlook with regard to production from privately-owned woods has become appreciably worse and is likely to deteriorate still further, and while we have some doubt as to the wisdom of any modification of the 10 years&apos; scheme now in process, we recommend that afforestation and the necessary acquisition of plantable land should continue as at present, but that the provision of holdings should be restricted to
not more than twenty-five per annum. This it is estimated will effect a saving of  182,000 next year, or over the period 1932-36, a reduction of net expenditure by 18 per cent, as compared with the present programme..10. Empire Marketing Board.67. We are in agreement with the main Report on the recom-mendation to abolish this Board and with the reasons given as justifying that course.11. Colonial Development Fund.68. The establishment of this Fund appears to have resulted from the recognition of the necessity for raising the economic and social level of the indigenous populations,, of non-self-governing Colonies and Mandated Territories, by assisting the provision of works designed to increase productivity, and to provide and to improve health, education and other services in these countries and thus to promote and increase the trade and industry with the U.Iv. These areas can no longer, in the present economic organi-sation of the world, be looked at only as resources of raw material, but must also be considered as potential markets for the manu-factures of this country. A reciprocal balance of trade is thus being aimed at by efforts to raise the economic level of the popu-lation, to increase their purchasing power and to extend the range and measure of their wants. This end is sought in aiding by grant or loan the construction of capital works, the provision of health services, education, transport, etc., which otherwise could not be done. The Fund was established as recently as 1929, and the Colonial authorities have been ux-ged to utilise the financial re-sources thus made available in undertaking necessary and desirable schemes of development; and, in our opinion, to reduce by  250,000, Lei., 25 per cent., the grant to the Fund, would result in discouragement to those charged with the duty of formulating and promoting schemes; would lead to widespread uncertainty as to what are the intentions of H.M. Government; would diminish the value of efforts already made, and may largely nullify the results expected from money already spent.G9. We are satisfied that the Advisory Committee exercises a wise discretion in the use of money placed at its disposal and we can see no sufficient, grounds for suddenly restricting the pursuit of a considered policy entered upon as recently as two years ago.70. We would add that to regard the grants and loans from this Fund as going to relieve local government of its obligations is, in our opinion, to misinterpret entirely the distinctive object of the Fund and the declared policy which led to its establishment.
13. Unemployment Grants Committee.71. We have already set forth our views on the question of the economic value of public expenditure for providing. work for the unemployed, and we feel it unnecessary, therefore, to say more under this head, except that we disagree with our colleagues&apos; pro-posals for the limitation of grants, as well as with the basis upon which they seek to apply such limitation.72. While we agree that care should be taken to secure that the schemes submitted have both economic and social value, no evidence was before us to show that proper discrimination is not exercised in that respect, or that the authorities directly concerned have, because of the measure of grant, been lacking in all necessary efforts to avoid waste or excessive cost.73. We agree as to the undesirability of two Departments making grants towards road and bridge improvements, and that as these are properly the concern of the Ministry of Transport, the Com-mittee should -discontinue making grants for such purpose.7 -SOCIAL SERVICES. (Chapter VI.   Main Report.)74. Earlier in our report we have expressed our views on the question of expenditure in relation to social services. We here record the extent of our agreement with or dissent from our colleagues&apos; recommendations with regard to the following : 1. Unemployment Insurance.75. We take the view that the Eoyal Commission on Unemploy-ment Insurance is the appropriate body to advise the Government on this matter. The Commission have had the advantage of hearing evidence oil the various aspects of the question and from many interested parties, including the Treasury and the Minister of Labour; they have been sitting almost continuously for some months and they have now issued an interim report.While we fully appreciate that under its terms of reference the Committee are entitled to consider and report upon Unemploy-ment Insurance, we have felt that for the Committee to do so upon a comparatively limited knowledge of the facts and of the issues involved, and in duplication of the work of a body appointed for that specific purpose, might well hinder, rather than help, the Government in any steps they might be recommended or desire to take.76. While it may be that the Eoyal Commission are limited in their consideration of national expenditure to that arising from Un-employment Insurance, whereas this Committee have been charged with the duty to review the whole field of supply expenditure in
relation to the national revenue, present and prospective; yet, having regard to the evidence tendered by the Treasury and the Ministry of Labour and the knowledge as to the national finances generally available from the successive statements made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and otherwise, we cannot share the view that the Members of the Royal Commission on Unemploy-ment Insurance are not fully aware of the whole position in these respects, or that due weight has not or will not be given thereto in any recommendations they have made or may make.For the rest, we are not in agreement with our colleagues&apos; recommendations, nor with many of the statements upon which they are based.2. National Health Insurance.77. We are in general agreement with the recommendations of our colleagues.We share their views that provision should be made from within the insurance fund itself to enable societies to maintain the statu-tory rates of benefit and also to retain in benefit members suffer-ing from prolonged unemployment where, from reasons of the heavy incidence of sickness and/or unemployment, societies yvould otherwise be unable to do so. We cannot, however, agree that the rights of unemployed members should, after the end of this year, be limited to the extent provided by the National Health Insurance Act, 1928.78. The present position of the unemployed member is that normally he retains his membership rights to full benefits for a period of eighteen months : that under the National Health Insur-ance Act, 1928, he is given a further period of twelve months at half-sickness benefit with medical and pension benefits; that at the expiration of this latter period he would have ceased to be insured but for the provision made by the National Health Insur-ance (Prolongation of Insurance) Act, 1930, under which the Exchequer undertook, at an estimated cost of  100,000 to  150,000 to pay thirty-six contributions for each Approved Society member who would otherwise, by reason of prolonged unemployment, have ceased to be insured during 1931 : his rights under the Act of 192S are thus continued for this year. We understand that no decision has yet been come to as to what action should be taken after the end of this year. If, as is recommended by our colleagues, the Prolongation of Insurance Act be not renewed, the effect will be that about 120,000 persons who have been continuously unem-ployed for more than two years and nine months will cease to be entitled to Health Insurance and Pension Benefits some time during 1932, and thereafter all insured persons unemployed for that period would automatically fall out of Insurance and Pension Benefits.
79. It seems to us that the money required to continue this emergency provision can be found from within the insurance fund without any unfair call upon the resources of societies whose members are more happily placed so far as employment is eon-cerned. The inability of members to pay contributions as a consequence of long unemployment does not arise from any moral obliquity on their part, but from circumstances and causes beyond their control which fall unevenly and inequitably upon the membership of some of the societies; and this risk, as well as the higher sickness risk, both of which, it appears, are at one and the same time being felt with increasing severity by certain societies, should be shared by all insured persons either by a re-imposition and, if necessary, an increase of the original levy for the Central Fund, or by a direct levy upon disposable surpluses of societies. Had it been the case that instead of members being grouped in separate societies they had been aggregated into one whole these risks would, in the circumstances which have arisen, have been spread over the whole field of the assured and would have been so borne. In our view, it would be inequitable in the extreme if, at one end of a national insurance scheme some societies, more fortunately circumstanced, should be able to continue, and even to increase, additional benefits to their members, whilst at the other end less fortunate societies should be faced with the prospect of having to reduce benefits to-below the statutory rates and at the same time to see a growing number of their members without title to any benefits at all.80. We feel that surpluses, which for the most part arise from differential risks, should in the first place be available to mitigate inequalities of this character. We are of opinion, therefore, that no society should, as a consequence of actually ascertained higher sickness risks, be forced to reduce benefits below the statutory rates, and that members suffering from prolonged unemployment who would, but for the provisions of the National Health Insurance (Prolongation of Insurance) Act, 1930, cease to be insured, should he retained in benefit as provided by that Act; and that the funds necessary for both purposes should be obtained by a direct levy on the disposable surpluses of societies. We consider that a direct levy on disposable surpluses possesses advantages over the proposed re-imposition and increase of the levy for the Central Fund ; the former method would, in our submission, be more equitable and would partake more of the real principle of insurance, namely, of pooling exceptional and abnormal risks. We do not, however, exclude consideration of both methods being used conjointly.81. It has been represented to us that a direct levy on disposable surpluses would present serious administrative difficulties involving, perhaps, recasting the existing Additional Benefits Schemes. We would not minimise these difficulties, but we do not feel that they
should be insurmountable. However, should they prove to be so, then we would prefer, rather than to resort only to the re-imposition and increase of the levy, that the whole question of the widening inequalities between societies should be dealt with by the method of partial pooling of all surplus funds recommended by the Eoyal Commission on National Insurance in their report published in 1926.3. Maternity Scheme.82. We have carefully examined the proposed scheme for the development of the maternity service in relation to its financial obligation upon the Exchequer, and bearing in mind the purpose of this Committee we have experienced some difficulty in fairly balancing the exigencies of the present financial position against the indisputable claims, alike on national as well as individual grounds, for the immediate provision of services which will lessen the very serious loss of life and of health in connection with maternity. This may, perhaps, be regarded as a case where the need for economy may be thought to exclude all question of the extension of a social service, however desirable such may be : that inasmuch as the nation has up to the present done without it, then its inauguration must wait over until better times. Pertinent as these considera-tions may be from the point of view of expenditure, we have been constrained to ask ourselves whether it is in the cause of wise economy in any real sense to allow over 3,000 women to die each year, and the health of many thousands more to be seriously damaged, as a result of childbirth or causes associated therewith : whether the heavy loss to the nation of lives, upon which under existing social services much money may already have been expended, or the cost in terms of future expenditure necessitated by the seriously impaired health of many of those who survive the hazards of childbirth, is not, leaving aside all other considera-tions, greater than the annual sum of  1,500,000 estimated to be necessary as a State grant to provide the contemplated extension of maternity services.83. In coming to our decision, we cannot overlook the very dis-disturbing facts revealed in the recently issued Interim Eeport of the Departmental Committee on Mat-ernal Mortality and Morbidity, and especially the statement that of the 2,000 cases of maternal mortality investigated by the Committee their finding was that not less than one-half icere -preventable. The Departmental Corn-mittee detail the services they consider essential in order to lessen the toll of maternity upon the womanhood of the nation, and we find that they generally coincide with those the scheme proposed by the Government is designed to provide. The Committee, further, indicate that they are convinced that many preventable deaths can be, in fact, prevented by such services.
84. Having regard to these weighty statements and after con-sidering the facts of the matter from the broadi aspect of national well-being, no less in terms of ultimate financial economy than of human life and health, we have come to the conclusion that the proposed scheme for the extension of maternity services is an urgent necessity, is overdue, and ought not to be delayed on any grounds of temporary and, in our view, illusory economy. It appears to us abundantly clear that so far from the scheme being unduly ambitious-tious in scope, it represents the bare minimum of requirement of any adequate attempt to avoid loss of life and injury to health known to be preventable.85. We should have wished that ways and means to provide these additional services were available without further charge upon the national finances, but if this be not the case, we cannot think that it would be wise or desirable economy on that account to postpone the provision of facilities known to be capable of appre-ciably lessening the hazards and discomforts of childbirth.86. We would add that under the Economy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1926, the Exchequer grants to National Health Insurance funds were reduced by a sum substantially larger than the annual additional charge estimated to be necessary to provide these maternity services; and that this relief to the Exchequer resulted in an annual loss to the National Health Insurance funds which, we understand,, the Royal Commission on National Health Insurance in 1926, indicated wrould have been sufficient to finance maternity services similar in character to those now proposed.4. Old Age and Blind Persons Pensions.   (Non Contributory).5. Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions.87. With regard to these sections of the main Report we only wish to observe that consideration of the rates of pension now paid can hardly be related to any fall in the cost of living either present or remotely prospective, and we feel the country generally would hesitate to contemplate making any reduction.6. Housing.(a) England and Wales. 88. We are not in agreement with our colleagues&apos; recom-mendation that the existing State subsidy under the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924, of  7 10s. in urban areas,, and  11 in rural areas, should be reduced to  5 and  8 10s. respectively, and that corresponding reductions should be made in the grants provided by the Housing Act, 1930.89. It is unhappily the fact that even with the present rate of Slate subsidy and corresponding contribution from the rates, local authorities still find it difficult, if not impossible, to provide houses for those most needing them, owing to the comparatively high
rents they are compelled to charge. The Housing Act, 1930, was at once a recognition of this and an attempt to meet the minimum requirements of those still living under conditions which are an affront to common decency and every standard of civilisation; and any proposal likely to hinder the provision of decent housing accommodation for the many thousands urgently in need of it would, in our considered view, be the reverse of sound economy  whether national or local. Under the Housing Acts (Revision of Contributions) Order, 1926, the contributions payable by the Exchequer were reduced from  9 in urban areas, and  12 10s. in rural areas, to  1 10s. and  11 respectively, for houses completed in England and Wales after the 30th September, 1927, and it cannot be doubted that this reduction resulted in a serious slow-ing down of house building by local authorities, with very ques-tionable economy on any long-range view. The following table shows, the total number of houses erected by local authorities with State assistance under the various Acts since 31st March, 1924 :-Houses built with State assistance by Local Authorities in 1925-1931.   (England and Wales.)Year ended	1919	1923	1924	1930	Total31st March.	Act.	Act.	Act.

The total built under the 1924 Act was therefore, 343,639.90. The increase shown for the year ended 31st March, 1928, is partly accounted for by the special efforts made by local authori-ties to complete houses, before the operation of the reduced subsidies under the 1923 and 1924 Acts, as from the 1st October, 1927. But the even greater rate of increase in 1927 over 1926 would seem to show that this factor may easily be over-estimated. If, in fact, it were a large contributory factor, then it seems to us open to grave question whether the rapid acceleration of housing pro-grammes chiefly to secure unreduced subsidies is likely to have conduced to economy, either in the planning or preparation of schemes or in the actual cost of the houses; and it may not be Incorrect to assume that the increase in the average all-in cost per non-parlour house from  503 in the quarter ended December,
2571926, to  518 in the quarter ended June, 1927, is closely related to the measure of acceleration that took place. If so, then it appears to us not improbable that many of the additional houses completed in 1927-28 cost from  9 to  15 more than those erected on the basis of contracts placed before ithe reduction of subsidies was announced in 1926.91. It is obvious that the economical construction of houses by local authorities is not best achieved by the sudden acceleration of programmes in one particular period, with a subsequent equal or greater deceleration, as a consequence of the alteration in the rates of the State grant. For the three years 1926-28, the total built under the Act was 176,043, whereas in the three subsequent years the number fell to 157,766 : over the seven years the average was 48.040 each year. Although the number of houses built from 1926 onwards falls lamentably short of the number assigned to each of the 15 years over which 2,500,000 were to be built Under the scheme as devised at the (time of the passing of the Act of 1924, and to secure which the financial provisions of the Act were designed, it is reasonable to assume that by 1927 the local authori-ties were getting into their stride and were planning ahead with the intention of providing houses in increasing numbers, and that for the succeeding years a progressively increasing number would have been built, but for the reduction in the subsidy as from the 1st October, 1927.92. Consideration of the weight of the financial burden arising from the building of houses under the 1924 Act, as well as a proper estimation of how far the needs of the country, as admitted in 1924, have been met will be assisted by a comparison of the figures given in the foregoing table relative to houses built under the 1924 Act, with the programme of the annual construction in mind when the scheme was promoted and approved by Parliament, as set out in the following table. To the total of 343,639 shown in the preceding table for England and Wales, there should be added 52,407 for Scotland, giving a grand total of 396,046 built under the 1924 Act up to the 31st March, 1931.Number of houses assigned to each of the 15 years under the 1924Act Scheme.Year.

93. These figures show that the scheme provided for the erection, *by the end of 1931, of 835,000 houses, excluding the 40,000 expected in 1925, under the 1923 Act. While this was doubtless a state-ment of maximum expectations, set as a goal to be aimed at rather than, perhaps, easily attainable, the fact that only 396,046 houses have been built less than 50 per cent. is to us a sufficient indica-tion that the State subsidy has not led to the wasteful or extravagant promotion of housing schemes under the 1924 Act. We consider, therefore, that no steps should be taken likely to slow down the building of houses by local authorities; that on the other hand the stimulus contained in the continued payment of the present rates of subsidy under the 1924 Act, and in the special grants for unhealthy areas and insanitary houses available under the Act of 1930, is still desirable; that the lessened housing-activities of local authorities which would inevitably result from any reductions would be deplorable, and would prove, in the very short run, not to be wise economy. It ought not to be overlooked that in the working out of the finances of the 15 year scheme under the 1924 Act, the maximum charge on the Exchequer and the local rates was on the assumptions : (a) That the full programme of 2,500,000 houses is carried out;(b) That 7J per cent, of the houses are built in agricultural parishes; and(c) That the full subsidy is payable in all cases during the whole of the period,estimated to be as shown in the following table : Year.

These give a total estimated Exchequer charge for the three years of  12,869,543 as against the original maximum estimate of  27,711,000. In comparing these figures, the reduction of the subsidy from the 1st October, 1927, must be taken into account.96. We would not, of course, contemplate that, in the altered financial circumstances, it would be desirable, even if it were possible, to stimulate local authorities to build on the scale originally planned for each year : nor would we suppose that the present state of the country&apos;s finances could support an annual charge of the order estimated in 1924 : neither do we over-look the additional provision since made under the Housing Acts of 1926 and 1930. But we think that the foregoing figures Bufficiently shbw that the housing problem of this country is not being solved at other than a minimum rate each year. .. 23,156,000* 22,828,000 22,084,000 21,251,000 20,333,000 19,329,000 18,210,000 16,961,000 15,555,000 13,976,000 12,226,000 10,332,0008,395,0006,457,0004,520,0002,583,000 645,000
97. It is regrettable, as well as significant, that since Septeni-ber, 1929, there has been practically no reduction in building costs, notwithstanding the very heavy general fall in raw commodity prices, but we consider that this important aspect of the housing problem should be dealt with by measures other than that of reducing the number of houses to be built in the hope that by lessening demand costs can be made to respond more closely to the general fall in the price of prime materials. We feel that other and better methods of reducing building costs should and can be found than one which, in effect, would condemn persons living in unhealthy and&quot; unsanitary houses or rooms to remain there in order that economic factors relative to building costs should be forced to operate : such a method seems to us to be intolerable and we cannot persuade ourselves that the resources of alternative action are so exhausted as to make it necessary.98. As to the fall in building costs since 1927, we consider it will be in the interests of the long-range policy of improvement in housing conditions in this country on economical lines that this should continue to go towards the reduction of the rents charged and chargeable for houses built under the Act, and not in reduction of the State subsidy. We have previously referred to the fact that the comparative high level of rents which have to be charged even with the existing State subsidy and rate contribution is so high as to preclude many of the worst-housed people from occupying the houses which Parliament by the subsidy provisions intended should be available for them. Moreover, the need for reduced rents is becoming more and more pressing as a consequence of the substantial and continuing fall in wages.99. We would add that any reduction of subsidy cannot fail to have seriously disturbing effects on the five-year programmes (in Scotland three-year) which local authorities have recently sub-mitted pursuant to the Housing Act, 1930, and the steps taken or to be taken to carry out such programmes. It would result in uncertainty and vacillation in the minds of local authorities : would impair their own budgetary provisions for such programmes and would throw once again the whole problem of meeting the shortage of houses into confusion. This cannot lead to sound economy, whether in administration or in expenditure.100. Finally, in any consideration of the price the country can reasonably be expected to pay for housing, the question of relative need and alternative cost, cannot, it seems to us, be excluded. The accumulating consequences of the bad housing of a vital part of the nation, in impaired health and reduced efficiency, and the cost of both to the country, are large and important countervailing factors, leaving aside all humanitarian aspects. It will sm*ely be of little avail to rationalise industry in its mechanical elements, if the housing conditions of the human element, present and
future, are to remain neglected and unimproved. A policy that would seek an improved industrial equipment for the nation, while leaving large numbers of the working population exposed to the dangers which inescapably arise from bad housing con-dilions, affecting physical and mental health, and productive and civic capacity would, in our judgment, be the reverse of economy, from whatever standpoint it might be judged.101. Under Section 43 of the Housing Act, 1930, a review of the contributions to be made by the State will take place after the 1st October, 1933, and we are of opinion that the existing subsidies under the 1924 and 1930 Acts should remain undisturbed until such review has been made.(6) Scotland.102. Our remarks as to England and Wales apply equally to the rates of subsidy payable by the State for houses erected in Scotland. We wish only to add that no sufficient evidence has been sub-mitted to lead us to the conclusion that the circumstances which called for the differentiation between the rates payable in Scotland and those payable in England have ceased to exist. We under-stand that this difference, which has operated as from the 1st October, 1927, when the original subsidies for Scotland remained unreduced, was based upon an ascertained necessity for special treatment by reason of the very low standard of housing in Scotland, even in comparison with that of England, and also because of geographical and other factors. We are not con-vinced that the higher rate of subsidy in Scotland was con-tinued only for the purpose of stimulating local authorities to the proper performance of their duties.103. While it may be that the position in Scotland will in the future warrant reconsideration and the adjustment of subsidies nearer to those being paid in England, we feel that the existing rates of subsidy for Scotland, under the 1924 and 1930 Acts, should, like those applicable to England and Wales, remain undisturbed until the general review under Section 43 of the Housing Act, 1930, and Section 25 of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1930, takes place after October, 1933.7. Education.(a) General.104. We differ fundamentally from the general outlook of our colleagues on the subject of elementary and higher education. Whether the expansion that has taken place since 1913 is properly described as rapid is a matter of approach, but in our submission, the extension of educational facilities is to be approved rather than deprecated, and it is noteworthy that this extension has had behind it the force of public opinion.   From the evidence tendered and the
information available to the Committee, we can find no warrant for any doubt that expenditure upon education generally is wisely administered with due consideration to the results obtained or obtainable. The admitted general improvement of the standard of education provided is a sufficient proof of this, and is more an occasion for appreciation than for retardation, whether, as our Colleagues suggest, such standard is in many cases superior to that which the middle-class parent is provid-ing for his own child or not. It is apposite here to state that of the 6,566.900 children in England and Wales of ages 5 to 15 estimated at 31 March, 1930, no less than 5,395,400 were being educated in State-maintained or State-aided elementary schools and the parents of the remaining 1,171,500 children are equally entitled to avail themselves of these schools for the education of their children if they choose. That for reasons of education or otherwise they do not cannot be regarded as affording any proper ground for a policy which would limit the standard of education in State-maintained or aided schools by reference to that obtainable in private schools.105. Consideration of the present cost of education in relation to what the nation can reasonably be expected to afford by reference only to the statistics of increased expenditure in comparison with early periods is incomplete, unless due weight is given to the neces-sity for improvement in the character and enlargement of the field of facilities which the additional expenditure was intended to provide. The history of educational development during the last decade has been a conscious and nationally approved policy of levelling out inequalities of educational opportunity and of broadening on well-planned lines the scope, the function and the character of public education ; and, it may here be noted, the pursuit of this policy has directly resulted in an appreciable improvement of the standard provided by private schools. In our judgment, it could not in any sense be in the interests of national economy, even in the present time of financial stringency, to seek at this stage to arrest this process; and we cannot agree to recommendations which would tend to restrict the field of educational opportunity of the majority of the children of the nation in order to meet financial necessities arising from causes for which they are not responsible, and the con-tinuing burden of which they will in their turn as adults have to bear; on the contrary, they should be given every opportunity of securing the knowledge and ability that will enable them to shoulder the load, and if not to lighten it, at all events to avoid any augmen-tation of the existing inequalities of its incidence.106. Thus apart altogether from the cultural aspects of education, to which all the children of the nation are equally entitled, a policy of - limiting educational facilities would ill-equip them as active citizens of the next generation to meet the changing and intensified
economic conditions of the world, and to take their places in the re-organised and rationalised industrial mechanism of the country. It is a truism that in business it is impossible to pause without retrocession, and it appears to us to be not less so in the important&apos; business of educating the nation&apos;s children. At the same time, any steps to reduce the administrative or other costs of education without injury to its services are not only essential in the financial exigencies of the present, but are desirable at all times; we are, therefore, in accord generally with the recommendation for securing a reduction of the number of education authorities by a concentra-tion of function in the larger local government units. We are not, however, convinced that, having regard to the national character of education, its development through the local authorities would be best continued by the State contribution ceasing to be on the basis of percentage grants and becoming merged in the general block grant system. This is a matter needing very careful con-sideration with equal regard to the finance of national and local government; and, in any event, it would seem wise, before adventuring upon this fundamental change in the financial relation-ship between the State and local education authorities, to await a fair period of experience of the working of the general block grant system for health and other services, initiated by the Local Govern-ment Act, 1929. We should here state that we do not subscribe to the opinion that the present system of percentage grants neces-sarily leads, or can be shown in any general degree to have led, to extravagant or careless expenditure on the part of local education authorities.107. If any appreciable reduction of salaries results from the re-view now taking place, we agree that there will be grounds for reduction of the State grant in respect of expenditure on salaries; but in any alteration of grants embracing a revision of the present guaranteed minimum of 50 per cent, a wider provision than is pro-posed by our colleagues should, we think, be made to adjust the in-cidence of any reduction equitably between the rich and poor authorities. An all-round reduction applicable to rich and poor dis-tricts alike would, in our view seriously affect the educational facili-ties available in just those districts where they are most needed and where owing to the consequences of prolonged industrial depression it is being found increasingly difficult to maintain even the present standard of educational facilities. Special provision should also be made for the necessitous areas at present receiving an addi-tional grant for elementary education.(b) Higher Education.108. We agree that, subject to our previous comments relative to the revision of grants, appropriate adjustments of grant for higher education should be made in respect of any reduction of teachers&apos; salaries that may take place.
109. We must, however, dissent from the views of our Colleagues relative to the growth of secondary schools and from the recom-mendations based upon them. Section 14 (4) of the Education Act, 1921, laid down the principle that &quot; children and young persons shall not be debarred from receiving the benefits of any form of education by which they are capable of profiting through inability to pay fees.&quot; The equity of the principle thus approved by Parliament is no less in 1931 than it was in 1921, and any proposals for a reduction of national expenditure involving a restric-tion of the progressive application of this principle would clearly be highly prejudicial to, and inequitable in its incidence upon, the child of poor parents. It should not, however, be concluded that the principle laid down in the Act of 1921 has even yet been trans-lated into practice in any substantial degree, for at March, 1929, the number of full-time pupils in maintained or aided secondary schools did not exceed for England and Wales 386,993, or 9.8 per 1,000 of the estimated population at July, 1928; while of the 477,828 children in England and Wales between the ages of 10 and 11 years in public elementary schools in March, 1928, only 63,055, or 132 per 1,000, were admitted into secondary schools, and of this number only about 40 per cent, secured free places. How many of sufficient mental capacity to profit thereby were denied the opportunity of secondary education because of their parents inability to pay the requisite fees, and also from a lack of accommodation, it is difficult to compute; but it is safe to say it was very greatly in excess of the number who secured entry. The number of free place pupils in secondary schools was on ,31st March, 1929, no more than 43.6 per cent, of the whole.110. Reference to the provision for secondary education made by institutions not aided from public funds seems irrelevant when it is remembered that provision by local authorities became necessary precisely because such institutions have never been, nor are they now, open to the vast majority of children, for obvious economic reasons. These institutions cannot, therefore, be regarded as offer-ing any additional accommodation to meet the needs of the child of poor parents and their existence is not a material factor in the proper consideration of the adequacy of the provision now made by the local authorities.111. Erom the information furnished by the Board of Education we very much doubt whether any worth-while economy of public expenditure is likely to be achieved by the proposals of our colleagues to raise the scale of fees at present charged to fee payers. On the other hand, the facts of the case go to show that any such increase would most probably be followed by a falling off in the number of fee-paying pupils with consequent loss of fees otherwise receivable and a corresponding loss to the Exchequer and the local authorities.   The fees charged by the different local
815authorities vary in amount with the varying social conditions and customs of the respective areas, and unless they are related to these and other local factors there is grave danger that they may fail   to   attract   fee-paying   pupils   with   resultant   unoccupied secondary school places.   If these vacant places were to become available as free places there might be something to be said in favour, but hardly on the score of economy of the nature to be sought by the Committee.   There are, moreover, very good grounds for the statement that at the present time there is a not incon-siderable&apos; number   of   secondary   school   places   unoccupied   or occupied by  elementary pupils below the age of 11,  because either the fees charged are too high to attract sufficient fee-paying pupils or the number of free places is too low, or both.   This can hardly be held to be wise economy, and any proposal for a general increase of fees to a standard more closely approximating those charged by private schools, could not fail to accentuate this state of affairs, with loss to the Exchequer, to the local authorities and to the youth of the nation as a whole.   We are unable, therefore, to support such a proposal.  We are likewise opposed to the pro-posal that an income test should henceforth be attached to the grant of free places and that modified fees should be charged to some parents.   This would inevitably result in hardship for the child of parents unable to afford even the modified fee; would in effect reduce the number of free places available and therefore add to the already large number of children who, though of mental capacity to profit by secondary education, are excluded from it by reason of inability to pay fees.   Notwithstanding the creditable fact that the school-life of free place holders is on the average con-siderably longer than that of fee-paying pupils, the measure of sacrifice of many parents in expenses and/or loss of earnings is not less, but probably more than, that of the better placed parents who either pay fees for public secondary school education for their children or send them to private schools.   It is a matter for regret that in many cases this sacrifice, though at first willingly borne in the interests of the child, often becomes insupportable owing to   adverse   economic   circumstances,    with    the   consequent premature   withdrawal   of   the   child   from   school   with   a view  to  becoming  a  wage  earner.    The  waste  of this from every point of view is too apparent to need any amplification.   We cannot persuade ourselves that the need for economy in expenditure is such that the nation would wish to raise the existing barrier of means which already completely shuts out from advanced educa-tional opportunity all but a small proportion of children, or that any real or lasting economy is to be found in that direction.112. As to the existing free secondary schools, these numbered, on the list October, 1930, only 76 out of a total number of 1,365 schools and accommodated 29,507 pupils out of a total of 416,771. These free schools, we understand, are all situated in areas of an
industrial character, and in the majority of them industrial con-ditions are at the present time notoriously bad. The upper limit for free places was raised in February, 1930, to 50 per cent., and the Board of Education retained power to grant exception in particular cases, the conditions of the exercise of which were agreed by the Treasury; and we are informed that no education authority would now be given permission to introduce free secondary education without special Treasury sanction. From this it would seem that before sanction is given to an increase of free places beyond 50 per cent, or to the introduction of free secondary educa-tion, the equities of the case as between the rest of the country and the particular area are sufficiently taken into account by the Board of Education and the Treasury. In any case, any prospective-tive saving from the recommendation of our colleagues in this respect would be of the de minimis order and would not seem likely in practice to justify itself.8. MISCELLANEOUS  SERVICES.(Chapter VII.   Main Report.)1. War Pensions.113. The general statement under this heading calls for no com-ment, but with regard to the reference in paragraph 534, that re-consideration of the rates of pension would follow from the adop-tion of the course referred to in the concluding chapter of the Main Report embracing an all-round reduction of income, in our view due consideration would in that event require to be paid to the fact that disablement is not only related to economic dis-ability but extends largely in many cases into the field of personal and social disability involving onerous restrictions and limitations upon the ordinary enjoyment of the amenities of life which cannot be related to any fall in the cost of living or be regarded as closely comparable with any loss of income to be borne by persons not subjected to such disability.2. British Broadcasting Corporation.114. We disagree with the recommendations of the Main Report in that we think the introduction of the principle that the State should guarantee the payment of loan charges in respect of capital expenditure may constitute a dangerous precedent in regard to an undertaking which, on its formation, was intended to be a self-supporting one, and opens up possibilities in our minds that the history of the Road Fund and the raids upon its revenue may, at some future date, be repeated in connection with the Corporation, and that the State may, under its guarantee in respect of capital
expenditure, find it impossible to avoid an extension of its liability, and that calls may arise on the general revenue of the country to meet deficiencies not expected at the moment. We regard the principle underlying the formation of the Corporation as a self-contained and self-supporting service as a sound one, and ought not to be impinged upon as a result of its successful operation and the unexpected growth of licence revenues as a consequence.115. Whilst it may be that entering upon large capital expendi-ture in respect of the acquisition of new premises was, in the cir-cumstances that exist, unwise, the Corporation would at all events,, under its present financial arrangements, be enabled to meet that capital expenditure out of revenue surpluses as they fell due, and without recourse to a State guarantee as proposed by our colleagues.116. If the successful operation of State enterprise, on the basis of the Broadcasting Corporation, is to be regarded as a ground for appropriation of a larger measure of its receipts than was originally intended, it cannot make for the general success of this type of State service.117. Finally, the Charter under which the Corporation at present operates is due to expire in December, 1936, and it seems to us that any revision of the proportion of the licence revenue to be re-tained by the Exchequer, as also other financial considerations in respect of the service, could most conveniently and appropriately be dealt with at that time rather than at the present time, and this would have the advantage of permitting of a wider appreciation of the financial requirements of the Corporation over a longer period of operation than is now possible.(3) Exchequer Contributions to Local Revenues.118. We agree that the general interdependence of national and local finance may have required, in any complete review of national expenditure, some reference to the finance of local authorities; but we would have wished that the&apos; Committee could have had the advantage of a fuller enquiry into this matter, including the taking of evidence and obtaining further and more exhaustive information.119. In the absence of this, we feel bound to say that, in our opinion, their somewhat summary comments upon this important aspect of the nation&apos;s expenditure are calculated to convey a wrong impression.120. Figures of the growth of the loan indebtedness of local authorities must lead to incomplete appreciations and defective con-clusions, unless they are considered by reference to the many and varied causes which have led to that growth, and unless there be also taken into account the increased value of the assets possessed by local authorities as a result of that expenditure.

Unlike most of the national debt, the debt of local authorities is represented by capital assets of very great value, including land, houses, schools, hospitals, as well as transport, water, gas, electric light and other trading undertakings. No less than  425,829,080 or 37.98 per cent, of the total represents loan debt on trading undertakings, which in the year ended 1928, earned, taken together, very substantial surpluses, some of which went to the relief of rates.123. CJearly, no proper appreciation of the growth of local ex-penditui-e can be assisted by reference to one item only of expendi-ture, such as that upon Poor Relief.   Against the growth of local
government expenditure there must be set the increase of rateable value,^ which in so far as it is in respect of new properties coming into rating, is only made possible by previous expenditure, and its continuance assured by subsequent expenditure. The opening up and development of new urban areas as a result of the outward spread of population has called for large expenditure, both on revenue and loan account, in the provision of even the minimum services imposed upon local authorities, not only by Statute, but also by the common requirements of present day society ; and a con-sideration of and judgments upon local government expenditure are incomplete which fail fully to take into account this large contri-buting factor, as well as the fact that the movement of population to housing estates publicly provided outside Cities and Towns calls for large additional outlay, without any corresponding reduction of expenditure being possible in the congested areas from which they are taken.124. We are unable, therefore, to subscribe to the view that local authorities, in their own field of public expenditure, have been &apos;&apos; piling up the public burdens &apos;&apos;; and whilst we agree that in the domain of local finance, as well as in that of national finance, strict supervision and wise economy is desirable, no sufficient evidence was before the Committee to show that in general local government finances are not well-managed, or that the publicly elected persons charged with their administration are not fully sensible of their obligations in this respect.125. Finally, it cannot be overlooked when considering present local government expenditure, that to a not inconsiderable degree it represents the liquidation of accumulated liabilities arising from an unwise and, as now appears abundantly clear, a very costly past neglect in the field of local government.9. CONCLUSION.126. In the introductory pages of our report we indicate that there are wide divergencies of opinion between our colleagues and ourselves as to the value of national expenditure and the grounds upon which it can be justified, as well as to the directions in which effective economy can be equitably sought and imposed; and the measure of our dissent from their recommendations is a reflection of our disagreement with, and the application of, the principles which our colleagues state in their concluding chapter have guided their proceedings.127. In the diversified and complex task set before the Com-mittee all members endeavoured with goodwill to secure agreement wherever possible, and although we differ fundamentally from our colleagues&apos; point of view on many important aspects of the problem which confronted the Committee, we do not in any sense question
128. Equally, we have been no less impressed by the need for wise economy; nor have we been less sensible of the requirements of the present and prospective position of the Revenue.129. We do not, however, agree that the kind of economy con-templated would be conducive to a restoration of trade or increased employment, or that a pre-war standard of prosperity could be accepted as being in any degree compatible with the enormously increased wealth producing capacity of to-day. Moreover, we con-sider that many of the recommendations of our colleagues would, in their operation, impose an unfair measure of sacrifice upon cer-tain large sections of the community, many of whom are already feeling with considerable and growing severity ithe effects of what has graphically been described as the &quot; economic blizzard,&quot; but would fail to lay under any comparable contribution others more favourably situated, many of whom are enjoying, to the extent of their fixed income, effortless benefits from the increased value of money due to falling prices. These include not only the holders of the National Debt, a large part of which was incurred when price levels were much higher than those which have for some years prevailed or which now prevail, but also the holders of the large post-war issues of Municipal Stocks, Fixed Income Debentures, etc., and of other money claims where, in general, similar factors have operated in varying, but appreciable, degrees.130. Our conclusion is, therefore, that if sacrifices are to be called for in order to maintain budgetary stability; to restore and to extend the trade of this country, and to re-absorb the unemployed into industry, then such sacrifices should be made by all sections of the community, with proper regard to the relativities of capacity to make and to bear.131. We take the view that the present financial difficulties of the country and of industry do not arise from any pursuit of waste-ful public expenditure or lack of responsible control of such, but are much more closely related to the policy of deflation followed since the war and confirmed by the return to the gold standard, and the subsequent aggravation of the burden in this respect as a conse-quence of the further fall in world prices; and that to argue that the present budgetary position, arises from public expenditure is to confuse cause with effect. The pursuit of this monetary policy and the subsequent accentuation of its effects by world causes has penalised with growing severity the productive and active elements of the nation, and at the same time has conferred fortuitous blessings on those possessed of money claims, protected by contract.132. We appreciate that the problem of meeting this situation and of securing that the burden arising therefrom shall be equitably distributed is one of great difficulty; and, so far as debt externally
held is concerned, is complicated by important international con-siderations. To the extent, however, of the internal debt and of the fixed interest bearing investments or other like money claims of those resident in this country, the problem is well capable of equitable treatment within the existing system of taxation, and whilst we do not favour imposing any further burdens upon pro-ductive industry, we should, were the matter one falling within the purview of the Committee, feel fully justified in submitting that there is ample scope for securing such additional revenue as would enable budgetary stability to be maintained, by the adjust-ment of taxation in relation to the uncovenanted benefits now being received by the holders of fixed incomes.133. Nor do we think that those more fortunately placed citizens in receipt of these benefits would upon a proper realisation of the nation&apos;s financial necessities as set out in the main report wish to withhold the comparatively slight measure of sacrifice which this additional taxation would involve, especially as it would leave them actually no worse off than they were when their title to the income to be differentially taxed originally arose, but would, perhaps, serve to assure the security of income which might otherwise be jeopar-dised by a continuance of the disequihbrium in national finances caused by changes of price level.134. While we do not wholly subscribe to our colleagues&apos; re-marks as to the inadequacy of Cabinet control of national expendi-ture, we feel that their suggestion for setting up a Standing Finance Committee of the Cabinet is worthy of serious consideration.135. In conclusion, we wish unreservedly to join with our colleagues in expressing warm appreciation of the invaluable assistance ungrudgingly rendered to the Committee by its Secretary, Mr. B. W. Gilbert, and of his unfailing courtesy, and in this appreciation we include, with equal measure, Sir Alfred Hurst who was attached to the Committee. The Committee are also much indebted to Mr. Waterfield and Mr. Morris for their very con-siderable help in the wide question of Defence and associated matters. To the heads of all Departments our thanks are also due for the ready and helpful way in which they placed at the disposal of the Committee the fullest information.Finally, we would wish to express our thanks to the other mem-bersof the Civil Service who in any way helped forward the labours of the Committee.We have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient -servants,CHARLES LATHAM.

APPENDIX II.(See paragraph 259 of Report.AIRSHIPS.Copy of Letter Addressed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.8th May, 1931.Dear Chancellor of the Exchequer,In our examination of Air Estimates we have noted that pro-vision has been made in Vote 3 in respect of Airships of  50,000 &quot; on account,&quot; pending a decision of H.M. Government as to their future policy. We understand that before taking that decision H.M. Government would be glad to have before them our views on the question of the desirability of incurring further expenditure on this account. We have accordingly obtained from the Air Ministry a statement of the proposals which they intend to lay before the Cabinet, and have taken oral evidence thereon from the Secretary of the Ministry, Mr. Bullock.The Air Ministry propose to adopt the policy of a &quot; watching brief,&quot; including the refitting andl recommissioning of B.100 and its use for short experimental flights, at a total estimated cost of  120,000, rising to  140,000 a year. This would involve a Supple-mentary Estimate of  70,000 this year, and a corresponding increase of expenditure in future years, against which the Air Ministry are unable to suggest any economies under other heads. This liability would continue until the experiments now being made in Germany and the U.S.A. have reached a point when it can be definitely stated either that there is no commercial future for the airship, or that it is worth while for H.M. Government to negotiate with outside interests for the construction and operation of airships on a commercial basis, presumably with the aid of a Government subsidy. We understand that the present Air Council do not contemplate in any circumstances a further programme of construction by the State itself.After due consideration, we think that this proposal should be rejected, for the following reasons : (1) In the first place, we consider that in the present financial stringency an exceedingly strong case would have to be made out before any new service of this magnitude could be sanctioned. In our opinion no such case has been made out in favour of the present proposal.(2) On the contrary, even if the financial situation were less unfavourable, we should regard further expenditure by the State on Airship development as extremely speculative : 
7 f) o(a) It has always been open to grave doubt whether Airships can ever be flown under the conditions of safety and regularity which are essential to a commercial service; and this doubt has obviously been increased to put it no higher  by the It. 101 disaster.(b) There appears to be no means of estimating the cost of operating such a service, including depreciation, or the probable receipts. Viewed as a business proposition, the scheme is a pure gamble; and while it can safely be assumed that a State subsidy would be needed for very many years to come, the amount required is quite uncertain.(c) H.M. Government already spend  350,000 a year on subsidies to heavier-than-aircraft services, and we understand that plans for additional services are under consideration. At the same time new fast steamship services are being promoted by several companies; while the possibilities of new develop-ments by wireless telegraphy and telephony are almost on-limited. It is at least doubtful whether the amount of fast traffic, both mail and passenger, will be great enough to support the competition of airships, which are unlikely to afford more than a compromise between the rival claims of speed, comfort, regularity and security, with these other forms of service.(3) The Air Ministry contend that it is worth while to continue to operate the E..100 because it is only by this means that a trained crew can be retained in being and the highly skilled art of airship navigation kept alive in this country. We do not over-look this argument, but we would observe that on the Air Ministry&apos;s own showing the importance of this object is relative, not absolute; they are prepared to spend  140,000 a year to secure it, but not  240,000 (if helium has to be provided). If airship development is ever revived in this country as a result of successful experiments abroad, in our opinion it is reasonable to expect that we shall be able to make a friendly arrangement with other Governments for British crews to be given the necessary training on foreign air-ships. Facilities for training in the B.N. and R.A.F. are commonly provided by H.M. Government for the personnel of other countries and we do not think it necessary to pay  120,000 a year to insure against the risk that such facilities will be denied us, provided that we are willing to pay a reasonable price for the privilege.(4) Although the Air Ministry inform us that they are deter-mined at all costs to restrict expenditure during the next few years to a maximum of  140,000 a year, we think that it may prove very difficult to adhere to this resolution, especially if, as seems highly probable, public opinion should insist on the substitution of helium for hydrogen in the Ft.100 as a necessary measure of
safety. The present Council cannot of course bind its successors. Generally speaking, we think that the existence of a nucleus organisation is a standing temptation to expenditure on further developments, which the State is unlikely to be able to afford.Even under favourable economic conditions, we think that the above considerations are such as would render very great caution necessary before further indefinite commitments were entered into by the State. Under existing financial conditions we regard them as conclusive against the Air Ministry proposal.We therefore recommend that R.100 should forthwith be sold or dismantled, that expenditure in 1931 be restricted to the  50,000 provided in the Estimates, and that expenditure in future years be kept at least within the limit of  20,000 per annum mentioned by the Air Ministry. Whether it is really necessary to spend up to that limit we have not had time to satisfy ourselves; the details would no doubt be carefully scrutinised by the Treasury.We think that there may be a good case for retaining Cardington, at any rate until a favourable opportunity occurs for disposal of the property; the question should be brought up for review after say three years.Yours faithfully, G. E. May.The Eight Hon. Philip Snowden; 2&amp;P.U0905-48a)  Wt. 6077-401 7500 7/31 P. St.  G. 335
