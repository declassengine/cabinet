&quot;fUS DCCUrEPY IS THE!&apos;. PROPERTY OF HIS BRIMNIC LIAJ3STY&apos; S GOvSRlThlSrTT.)3 G RA..P.  169 (51)COPY HO.CABINET. THE FP^NCO-AIviERIC^ AGRejEISNT ABOUT THE HOOVER PLAN.Memorandum by tho Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Press Communique issued in Paris last night shows that the United States representatives and the French Government have arrived at an agreement on the principle of the Hoover Plan, but have left a number of important reservations raised by the French Government to he discussed between France arid the other Powers concerned,      The following are the main points in this document.lo      On the question of principle, the agreement provides that payments of inter-governmental debts are to be postponed for one year.      But the German Government is to pay the full a mount of the unconditional annuities, the pasinents thus made being reinvested by the Bank for International Settlements, in &quot;Guaranteed Bonds of the German Railways&quot;.This arrangement about the unconditional annuities represents a considerable departure from the original Hoover proposal.      The unconditional annuities are obligations no more binding in character than many of the debts due to us by other Governments (for example the Relief Debts,due by Czecho-Slovalcia, Poland, Yugoslavia,  etc , and the Reconstruction debts of Belgium and the Belgian Congo) , and there was no reason why an exception should be made to the general suspension in regard to these annuities,,      It is true the payment is mainly make-believe.     The German Government has in fact no- funds where-/
with to make a real payment in foreign currencies,, What is proposed is that the G-erman Government should make a nominal payment to the Bank for International Settlements which would at once repay it - a childish enough manoeuvre which it is difficult to Believe would impress even the French Chamber.But, unfortunately there are some unpleasant elements of reality mixed up with the make-believe. The repayment is not to be direct to the German Government but to the German Railway Company which will have to give &quot;guaranteed Bonds&quot; as security.      This provision is certain to raise difficulties.    If the intention is to obtain a real charge on the German railways, the German Government will almost certainly protest against it as a violation of one of thfe cardinal principles of the Young Plan that all pledges and securities . - 7      . should be abandoned.   Again it is not clear who Is to guarantee the Bonds: but, if as we have reason to believe,  the French Government are wanting a guarantee from the Reichsbank, the proposal is one which both the German Government and the Reichsbank will be bound to resist.    It would doubtless require legislation which would be extremely difficult to obtain.So far as we are concerned, we hove no reason to support these proposals.    The German banks, including the Reichsbank, are dependent on the credits which the London market has been giving them for the wherev/ithal to meet their commercial obligations.    We can certainly not afford to continue these credits if the Reichsbank is to
start guaranteeing reparation liabilities. Further, insofar as the arrangement proposed would give these repayments a priority over the future annuities due by Germany, our prospects of obtaining payment of our share in these annuities would bB prejudiced (see next paragraph).2.   The agreement next provides that all the suspended payments shall be repaid with interest, by ten annual instalments beginning July 1st, 1933.   This arrangement apparently is to apply to all the inter-governmental payments which are postponed this year, i.. c, not only the German reparation annuities both conditional and unconditional, but also the debt payments due by the Creditor power to the United States.       Thus, the relief granted in the current year is to be counterbalanced by a very substantial addition to the liabilities of all debtor countries during the ten years 1933 onwards.This proposal seriously affects our interest in a variety of ways :-First of all, the effect on Germany is to increase her liabilities under the Young Plan during the ten years from 1933 onwards by approximately  10 millions a year.       The amount of the annuity fixed by the Young Plan was  90 millions in 1933 and increased steadily to approximately  110 millions in 1943.       These payments, which it is now evident that Germany is hot likely to pay, are to be increased &quot; :.by an additional  10 millions a year, making the total liability  100 millions in 1933 rising to  120 millions in 1943.      Similarly, our debt payment to America, which from 1933 onwards was to be at the rate of  38 millions a year, will be increased during these ten years by approximately
0 h 00 &amp; 0 4 millions a year to  42 millions a year.    Thus the effect of the arrangement vaill he to increase substantially our annual liabilities to the United States during the next ten years:   though, in theoryy these payments should he compensated by increased receipts it seems highly doubtful whether v/e will be able in fact to collect these increased receipts,Further, the arrangement hits us even more seriously if and insofar as the additional German payments take priority over the postponable part of the ordinary annuities.      It must be remembered that under the Young Plan we have on.! y an insignificant share in the first  30 millions paid by Germany (the unconditional annuities) but we are entitled to about one-half of the next . 20 millions paid by Germany on account of the conditional annuities,      We were induced to accept this arrangement, despite misgivings,  on the ground that it might reasonably he hoped that in any case Germany would he able to pay a minimum of  50 million a year,  in which case we should receive our due proportion of the total German payments.      It becomes more and more evident that the estimates of German capacity made at the time of the Young Plan were too optimistic,  and the prospect of Germany being able in any case to pay a minimum of  50 millions seems remote.      But if Germany is now to be asked to pay  10 millions a year over and above the normal future annuities and this payment is to be specially secured and rank in front of the conditional part of the ordinaryannuities we will only begin to receive any
substantial amount of&apos; reparations after Germany has paid  40 millions, and the prospect of our obtaining our full normal share will be most seriously prejudiced.The arrangement adopted in the Young Plan under which France receives a priority on the unconditional annuities was a departure from all previous inter-Allied Agreements;    and if it is now proposed to modify the Young Plan by imposing an additional  10 millions a year on Germany in front of the annuities provided in the Young Plan, we are on very strong ground in declining to assent unless the distribution arrangements are revised and the German payments are divided between the different Creditor,Powers in proportion to their respective shares of the total annuities (i.e.  the Spa percentages as modified by subsequent adjustments).It is suggested that whatever is done in regard to other points His Majesty&apos;s Government should make their acceptance of the Franco-American proposals conditional on obtaining satisfaction in regard to this point.3.      The Franco-American Agreement then proceeds to detail in a very summary fashion four points on which the French Government have made reservations.     These reservations have apparently not been accepted by the United States Government, but are left to be settled between France and the Powers concerned.      All of them raise difficulties from our point of view.      They are(a)    The principal Central Banks are to organise -5-
organise loans for the assistance of the countries of Europe which are particularly affected by the postponement of reparations,.      The countries which Prance seems to have in mind are Yugoslavia and Greece3 a s all the other minor European Creditors obtain a benefit instead of suffering a loss,, by the general suspension of inter-governmental debtSo        The main financial difficulties in Europe are elsewhere; they are in Austrias Hungary and germany      In any case there is no justification for this country, which loses  11 millions under the Hoover Plan,, to put up moncsy in order to enable the minor Allies of Prance to avoid any sacrifices,,        Moreover, the Bank of England, as is well known 9 has done very much more than, any other Central Bank to relieve the credit difficulties of Europe 0       In recent weeks it has In fact not only without assistance from Prance but despite obstacles placed in its way by France been holding up several of these countries.        It is nothing short of Impudent that the French now should attempt to compel the Bank of England to join in financing the-Lx? Allies when they refuse to assist it in maintaining the finances of other countries,,       &quot;The proposal is the more objectionable as it contemplates that the credits  should be granted by the Central BankSo So far as we are concerned;,  such credits are matter that have to be decided by the Bank of England on its own responsibility3 and it would be contrary to recognised practice for His Majesty1s Government to intervene and to press t he Bank to undertake such credits for political reasons.
(Id)      The French Government wish to obtain an understanding from the Bank for International Settlements that France should not supply the Guarantee Fund provided for under the Young Plan except by monthly instalments out of German payments,,    This is a rather complicated question on which again, the French wish to get a concession to the disadvantage of the other Creditor Powerso    Under the Young Plan, as a counterpart to    the French priority on the unconditional annuity, France had to put up a fund of  25 millions which was to be used to equalise the distribution of the German payments in the event of a moratorium on the conditional annuitieso   There is no doubt that the Plan contemplated that France should pay this Guarantee Fund over to the Bank for International Settlements in a lump sum immediately a moratorium is declared, and indeed the French Finance Minister told the Chamber so only ten days agoo    If the French wish to get out of their obligation to put up this Fund, the obvious and simple course is for them to agree  (as proposed above) that the annuities should be distributed between the different Powers in the Spa percentage and there would then be no need for any Guarantee Fund,The French have already put the question to the Bank for International Settlements and appear confident that they will get the Bank&apos;s assent to their proposal,,    If so.
Hi &amp; i*the Bank&apos; s action will he ultra vires.      The Bank for International Settlements, has no power to interpret the Plan and any questions of difference between the Creditor   Governments and/or the Bank have to he referred to arbitration,,(c)        The French Government stipulate that some arrangement should he arrived at for continuing deliveries In kind aid suggest that a Committee of Experts should he nominated to consider  -how their demands may he reconciled with the spirit of President Hoover&apos;s proposal.This is, again, a proposal which seriously affects our interests,,      For this country it is essential that deliveries in kind should he suspended if and when cash payments are suspended; otherwise a position might soon arise under which the Continental countries would he drawing all their payments from Germany as deliveries in kind whereas we should he receiving nothing.       After considerable difficulty we obtained an agreement at the Hague which entitles us to obtain, raider the so-called &quot;Separation Recovery Act&quot;, payments equivalent to approximately 30% of all d.liveries in kind, even under a moratorium.,     But we should have some difficulty in attempting to insist on the execution of this agreement in face of the Hoover proposal.        We shall be on stronger ground in insisting that deliveries in kind must he completely suspended or that,  if continued, their cash value must be paid to the Bark for International Settlements by the recipient Governments( which get the cash from their own nationals who buy the goods).        We understand that:    -   8   -
th.e United States Government entirely share our views on, this point and it will he essential forus to oh tain, a settlement of this question onthese linea.(d)      Finallys the French Government reserve the right to request from the German Government^indispensable assurances concerning the utilisation for exclusively economic purposes ofthe sums delivered to the Reichsbank&quot;*    In theorya request of this kind, is perhaps not unreasonableand in fact we have privately urged the German.Government to give such assurances.    But it Is one thing for the German Government to volunteer some statement on th3 point and quite another thing to make the suspension of payments-, which in. fact is necessary, conditional on. politicaldeclarations which will certainly be regarded inGermany as humiliating.4,      The general effect of the so proposal is very seriously to modify the intent and purpose of the Hoover Plan,,    As we understood it,that Plan contemplated a very simple arrangementvizo that all inter-governmental payments shouldbe postponed for one year and that at the endof the year the rights and obligations of thevarious Powers should be resumed from the samepoint at which they were broken, off.    The fact is that Germany is not able to pay anything atpresent and suspension of pajnrtents Is not a concession, &quot;but a recognition of this facto    Theproposal   now contemplated involving, as it does,a series of complicated settlements is certainly not likely to create the necessary confidence-9-
in Germany, and bo will defeat the main object which the President had in view.      Further,  if the French are to obtain these concessions to their point of view a host of similar1 demands will be put up by other Powers.      Belgium has already stated that the Hoover Plan cannot be accepted unless it is adopted to her special needs.      The Greeks have protested violentlyagainst the loss of some of their receipts. It remains to be seen whether Italy will not raise special demands if others do so.The policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt  seems clear.      We accepted the Hoover Proposal immediately and wholeheartedly and we have already taken steps to carry it into effect on the basis that it meant a simple year&apos;s suspension of all payments.      Y/e should,  if possible., get back to that basis which we believe to be entirely acceptable to the United States Government and to be in the best interests of the European States.      If- this is not possible, we shall have to subordinate our acceptance of the French Scheme to a revision of the distribution arrangements so as to safeguard our rights.      \7e shall have to see that deliveries -in kind are completely suspended or their value paid in cash by the recipient countries to the Bank for International Settlements for refund to Germany, As regards loans to European countries,   this is purely a banking matter on which His Majesty&apos;s Government must decline to enter into any commitments.
5The procedure to he adopted remains to&quot;be settled.xt seems inevitable now that theremust he a Conference, preceded perhaps by discussions between Experts so as to prepare the ground.      Any such Conference must obviously not be allowed to take place in Paris, and it should,  if possible, take place in London, Whether in the meantime the financial position in Germany, Austria, and Hungary can be maintained remains to be seen.P o S oTreasury ChambersJuly 7th9 1931.- 11 -
