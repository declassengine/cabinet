(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)a.SECRET,CP.  155 ( 31). COPY NO,0 A B I N B T,UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE COMMITTEE. SECOND REPORT.1. In accordance with the Conclusions reached by theCabinet on the consideration of the Commjttee&apos;s Pirst Report on June 10th, 1931 (Cabinet 32 (31) Conclusion 10), the Committee have examined the two draft Unemployment Insurance Bills, the preparation of which was authorised on that occasion.2. The first of these Bills is the Unemployment Insurance(No. 4) Bill,  1931, the objects of which are to raise the borrowing powers by  25,000,000, making a total borrowing power of  115,000,000, and to extend the transitional period for a further six months.     The cost of this extension is estimated at about  20,000,000, of which, about  5,000,000 will fall in the current financial year..3. A copy of this Bill, with a covering Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour, is attached to this Report as Appendix I.The Committee recommend the Cabinet -To authorise the introduction in the House of Commons of the Unemployment Insurance (No. 4) Bill,  1931, in the form of the draft set out in Appendix I hereto, subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable.
4. The second Bill is the Unemployment TnsAorajace-(No.  3) Bill, 1931, the main object of which is to give effect to the recommendations contained in the Committee&apos;s First Report (Paper CP. 149 (31)) as to anomalies. The Committee have had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Labour covering a first draft of this Bill. They have also conferred with a Deputation frv^m the General Council of the Trades Union Congress in regard to the proposals, and in this connection have had before them the Report of the General Council&apos;s Social Insurance Advisory Committee on the Royal Commissions recommendations.5. The Committee have given very careful considerationto the best method of making provision in the proposed Bill to give effect to the Cabinet&apos;s approval of their recommend-ations contained in their First Report (Paper CP. 149 (31)) regarding (l) intermittent workers, (2)  casual and short-time workers,  (3) married women, and (4)  seasonal workers. As a result of further examination of the problems involved and the representations made to them by the Deputation from the General Council,, the Committee have reached the conclusion that in the short time available it is not possible to make detailed provision in the Bill for dealing with the anomalies and that to attempt to do so in the light of existing information and data w^uld, whilo curing certain anomalies, in all probability result in creating new abuses and injustices.      It will, of course, be necessary to take power in the Bill to alter the existing provisions with regard to unemployment benefit so as to &quot;deal with these classes.      It will, however, be essential to secure the elasticity necessar. for administering such r estrictions as maybe imposed.
In these circumstances the Committee are of&quot;-opinion, that&quot; the best solution will he to give the Minister of Lahour general powers in respect of these classes to be exercised by Regulations made after consultation with a Central Advisory committee    That part of the Bill which deals withanomalies has&apos;accordingly been re-drafted on these lines and a revised draft of the Bill is submitted to the Cabinet as Appendix 11*6.        Attention is particularly directed to throe points arising from this method of dealing with-the anomalies. In the first place, it may be alleged that the suggestion is a reversion to the ministerial.discretion which was abandoned by the 1927 Act, following on the. Blanesburgh Committee&apos;s Report.    There is, however, a very important difference.    The old Ministerial discretion was a power to allow or disallow benefit in individual casecc    The present suggestion would not enable the Minister to do more than make general rules.    The decision in any particular case would be outside the Minister&apos;s control and would be given by the.statutory authorities. In the second place, there maybe criticism, in the House, as there has been before,..on account of what,has been regarded as a dangerous and growing tendency to legislate by means of Regulation rather than directly by specifying detailed provisions in an Act.    The answer is that owing to the great diversity of cases, that have to be covered,, any attempt to lay down rigid rules in detail in the Statute, would only result in -the creation of new anomalies.    The proper-or
procedure is for Parliament to lay down the general principles and for those principles to &quot;be worked and applied in detail with the advice of persons familiar with industrial conditions.,      this procedure alone gives the elasticity and the opportunity for periodical and prompt adjustments which are essential if such rules are to he administered with any prospect       avoiding serious hardship.      In the third place, it may he contended that what is being done  is not sufficient guarantee that the Government really intend to deal effectively with anomalies and that until some better guarantee is given the additional money required and the extension of the transitional period should not be agreed tg.      The answer to this must be that no other procedure is practicable, and this should be coupled with the assurance that the Government agree in principle with the reoommend-ations of the Rqyal Commission as regards the four classes in question, and will undertake4.
1 to press on with the formation- of.&quot;-the^would-vi-sory Commiftee and the drafting of Regulations as soon as possible after the passing of the Bill into law.7.      It is obviously impossible to say what savings will &quot;be effected by the provisions regarding anomalies until the Regulations have been made.      The primary objeet however, it to remove proved anomalies&apos; and the saving can only be the amount that can be saved without creating injustices -8.      If the matter is dealt with as suggested, it will be for the proposed Advisory Committee to deal with the various points of detail when they are considering a draft of regulations.      It will, however, be necessary for the Minister of Labour to be in a position, when dealing with the Bill on borrowing and extension of the transitional period, to indicate generally the lines on which, subject to the advice of the Advisory Committee, nh.e would propose to proceed.It is not anticipated that any serious difficulty will arise in dealing with married women and seasonal workers.      Thf? General Council do not object to the conditions which the Royal Commission thought should be imposed under these heads, provided that certain safeguards are insisted upon-    The Committee are in general agreement with the General CouncilTs views,  and, to give effect to their desire for safeguards, consider that 8. married woman should not, ap, a condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit, be required to prove that, having regard to her industrial experience and the industrial circumstances of the district in which she is residing, she can reasonably expect to obtain insurable employment in that district.
1 9 1 JAs regards workers who habitually work only two days a week in insurable employment,  the General Council are inclined to agree, and the Committee recommend, that so far as their limited working is not due to inability to obtain full-time work, they should not get benefit for any week in which they do any work.    As regards persons earning high wages for less than a full week&apos;s work,  the Committee agree that the principle should be that of deducting from the benefit otherwise due half the excess of the actual earnings of the previous week over a specified figure-.    The General Council made a proposal of their own on this point but after discussion were practically convinced that it was not really a workable one and would; we think5 bo not indisposed to accept the above principle, in default of a better^-6-
9. Clause 3 of the Bill has nothing to do with theReport of tho Royal Commissioiio      This Clause carries out an undertaking given &quot;by the Minister of labour that statutory sanction for the matters named in the Clause would &quot;be obtained.      The Committee recommend the acceptance of the Clause.10.        The Committee make the following recommendations respecting the two Draft Bills appended to this Report -(l) That the Minister of Labour should beauthorised to introduce the Unemployment Insurance (No. 4) Bill in the House of Commons in the form of the draft set out in Appendix I hereto, subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable.(2) That approval should be given to theUnemployment Insurance.--(No. 3) Bill in the form of the draft annexed hereto as Appendix II5 subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirableo(3) That the Minister of Labour should beauthorised to introduce the (No.  3) Bill in the House of Commons, if possible, before the Debate on the Financial Resolution on-the Unemployment Insurance (No. 4)  Bill, and to explain the Government&apos;s intentions on tho linos of paragraph 8 of this Report.Signed on behalf of the Committee.ARTHUR HENDERSON..Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, So V. 1. , 16th June, 1931.

Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1. Attached is a draft Bill to increase the borrowing powers and to extend the transitional period, in accordance with Cabinet 32 (31) Conclusion 10 (c) and (d).2. The first clause in the Bill raises the borrowing powers by  25,000,000, making a total borrowing power of  115,000,000.3. The second clause extends the transitional period fora further six months.      The original period governing the payment of transitional benefit,  as laid down in the 1927 Act, was twelve months after the commencement of that Act, that is, after 19th April,  1928.    This was extended in 1929 to 24 months,  in 1930 to 36 months, and in 1931 to 42 months.    As the Acts stand at present, transitional benefit begins to run out in October,  1931.    The effect of the new clause,  if it becomes law, will be that benefit will begin to run out in April,  1932.4. The cost of the provision in the second clause(extension of transitional period) may be about  20,000,000 of which about  5,000,000 would fall in the current financial year.(Intd.)
