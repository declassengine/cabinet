THE Sub-Committee met at 11 a.m., on Thursday, the 16th July, 1931, in order to consider the Government of India&apos;s proposals for the Indianisation of the Indian Army, together with a Note thereon by the Secretary of State for India.   The relevant papers are attached as an Annexure.2. The proposals, which represent the considered opinion of the Government of India, based on the recommendation of the Commander-in-Chief, are to the effect that the field of Indianisation should be extended to embrace the components of a complete Indianised War Division, with its full complement of artillery (two brigades of field artillery and one brigade of mountain artillery), engineers (sappers and miners), pioneers and signals, as well as a cavalry brigade with a battery of horse artillery, together with the necessary complement of staff and ancillary services. In addition, it is proposed to include two armoured car companies in the scheme.3. The Army Council do not feel in a position to disagree with the general principles of the scheme drawn up by the authorities on the spot, who, with the full weight of responsibility, are endeavouring to carry out what is understood to be the considered policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Sub-Committee endorse this view, but consider it their duty to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the following four questions, especially the important implication involved by the temporary reduction in the efficiency of our Forces in India.4.   Four important questions are involved :  The first is that of the arming of units; the second is that of the possible difficulties of mixed personnel in units; the third is that of the effect on War Office commitments and requirements of any temporary loss of efficiency due to the change; and the fourth is that of the establishment of an Indian Sandhurst.5. In view of the fact that the Government of India and the Commander-in-Chief personally are prepared to take such measure of risk as may be entailed by these proposals, the Sub-Committee recommend, subject to endorsement by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the matters of political principle involved in the foregoing, that general approval should be given to the Government of India&apos;s scheme, and, in particular, (a) to the proposal that the field of Indianisation during the next stage of expansion should consist of the components of a complete Indianised War Division, with its full complement of artillery, engineers, pioneers and signals, as well as a cavalry brigade with a battery of horse artillery, [5744]
together with provision for staff, departmental and ancillary appointments, and also for two armoured car companies; (&amp;) to the proposal that the annual intake into the new Indian Military College should be fixed at 60.The precise method of carrying the scheme into effect, particularly with regard to the thdianisation of such formations as horse and field artillery, will require more detailed examination; but this need not delay general acceptance of the Government of India&apos;s scheme as recommended above.W.

Copy No.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.DEFENCE  OF INDIA.-INDIANISATION.Note by the Secretary of State for India on the Government of India&apos;s Proposals oJ the iBth April 1931, regarding Indianisation in the Indian Army.1. The commander-in-Chief in India, speaking in the Council of State with the authority of the Government behind him on the 25th February 1931, stated &quot;His j\!ajesty&apos;s Government have accepted the principle of more rapid Indianisation, the Indian Government have agreed, and I as Commander-in-Chief, with all the weight ofresponsibility on my shoulders for the defence of India, have also accepted it.&quot;&apos; - -2. The Government of India had in fact already proceeded on this principle in paras. 157 to 170 of their Despatch on Proposals for Constitutional Reform dated 20th September 1930, which was presented to Parliament as Cmd. 3700. Their main recommendations are contained in paras. 160 and 161, which are reproduced in an Appendix to this Note.3. In their air mail letter of the 6th April 1931, circulated herewith, the Government of India have worked out, and in two important respects expanded, the scheme foreshadowed in their Despatch. It will be seen that that scheme contemplated the Indianisation in course of time of &quot; an officer establishment sufficient for a complete Infantry division of 12 battalions, a Pioneer battalion and a brigade of three regiments of Cavalry, together with an adecpiate margin for ancillary departments, staff and command appointments, and for wastage in premature-retirements and transfers to civil departments.&quot; The scheme now forwarded, while preserving the intention of Indianising to the extent of a division, marks a new advance by proposing &quot; that the field of Indianisation during the next stage of expansion should consist of a complete Indianisecl War Division&quot; with its full complement of technical arms and ancillary services. The proposals involve, first the extension of Indianisation to branches which have hitherto been reserved exclusively in the hands of the British Army in India, notably to Horse and Field Artillery units and Armoured Car Companies; and secondly, a more definite and speedy rate of Indianisation within the field defined above.4. The scheme thus presents two aspects, the scope of Indianisation and the rate of initial intake, and the two are not inevitably bound up with each other. It will be convenient to deal with the latter aspect first, since there is a special reason for an early decision on this point. It should be recalled that during the proceedings of the Round-Table Conference, His Majesty&apos;s Government accepted the principle of establishing a Military College in India &quot;to train candidates for commissions in all arms of the Indian Defence Services&quot; (Report of the Defence Sub-Committee, para. 4 (2) (b)).* The Government of India have already appointed a Committee of Experts in India to work out details of the establishment of such a College, and the Secretary of State has informed them, in a telegram dated 11th February 1931, that they &quot; should indicate for the guidance of the Committee what initial output from the College should be aimed at.&quot; The Committee must clearly have ,some guidance in this matter before it can begin to formulate any useful proposals. It is suggested in para. 161 of the Government of India&apos;s Despatch that the Indian College when established should be on the lines of those at Kingston in Canada and Duntroon in Australia, where the&apos;normal course of training is three or four years, and incidentally where the Colleges do not cater exclusively for the Defence Forces.   It may be(Circulated by request of the Secretary of State for India.)* Presented to Parliament with Cmd. 3772, and circulated to the C.I.D. as 177 D. 49      160   6.31
assumed, however, that the greater part of the students will look to an Army career on leaving the College. The sooner, therefore, that an annual rate of intake into the Army can be determined the better, and a decision on this point need not necessarily await a comprehensive decision on the Government of India&apos;s scheme as a whole.5. In paras. 160 and 161 of their Despatch, the Government of India estimated (I) that an intake of 20 to 25 Indian officers a year would, in course of time, supply an officer establishment for 16 units, together with an adequate margin for ancillary departments, staff and command appointments and for wastage ; (2) that if the intake were increased to 33 a year, this, on the same basis of calculation, would require 25 units to absorb it. But they also said that the rate of progress of Indianisation in Artillery, Engineers, Signals and Air units (i.e. as distinct from the outside appointments referred to above) &quot;is at present too uncertain to be included in this estimate.&quot; The calculation in both cases assumed &quot; the conversion of the officer establishment of Indian units from the existing pattern, which consists of 12 to 14 King&apos;s commissioned officers and 19 or 20 Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers, to a homogeneous cadre of 23 to 25 King&apos;s Commissioned officers.&quot; That process has been a cardinal feature of the whole policy of Indianisation since 1927 ; and it is emphasised both in the Government of Indians Despatch of last year and in their present proposals.6. They now estimate that the new Indianised Force &quot; should absorb an establishment of 874 officers, which could be built up by an annual intake of 53 in .17 years&quot;; and allowing for the training of cadets for the new Indian Air Force (which is already beginning to take shape as the result of a previous decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government) they think &quot; it would be safe to announce a round number of 60 as the annual intake that we could aim at from British India for the Indian Military College.&quot; The question whether Indian Air Force cadets should in fact be trained exclusively at the new College or otherwise is under separate consideration.   It does not affect the present discussion.7. Two questions thus arise : (1) what should be the total establishment to be aimed at ?. (2) what would be a suitable initial rate of intake based on that establishment ? As regards (1), the officer establishment of 16 units of the Indian Army taken by themselves, when converted to the new pattern, would be about 400. But the establishment eventually required for a complete war division and cavalry brigade excluding medical and veterinary services may be taken as 650. Thus the new proposals involve an increase of about 60 per cent, in officer personnel over the old.; and on this basis alone the annual intake would have to be raised from the 2o contemplated in the Government of lndia&apos;s Despatch to 40. But the estimate given in the Despatch was admittedly very tentative (for instance, it did not include provision for the technical branches of the Indian Army, and moreover much depends on the interpretation of the words &quot; in course of time &quot; quoted in para. 5 above) ; and on the estimates now given, though they must also be regarded as provisional, an increase to 53 does not in itself appear disproportionate.8. As regards the initial rate of intake, the Government of India in their present proposals have avoided the mistake too often made in the past of Lrying down an elaborate time-table of Indianisation. Such programmes may do more harm than good, since they must in any case depend on unforeseen factors such as the supply and quality of recruits and the degree in which Indianisation continues to justify itself in practice. They are useful only in so far as they give a mathematical index of the annual rate of intake to be laid down at the start ; and that is what the Government, of India now aim at determining. The estimate of 17 years for completion of the process is thus of no particular significance. The practical question is whether the Army can begin to absorb 53 Indian officers a year. As shown above, an inclusive figure of 53 for the Army would net in itself be disproportionate. It is perhaps open to doubt whether the Government of India are right in assuming that they could begin at the outset with an intake of so many as 53 into the Army or a corresponding intake of 60 into the new &quot; Indian Sandhurst.&quot; In the first place, the Government of India do not refer to the possibility that Indians may still continue to enter the Cadet Colleges in this country if they are willing and able to qualify, as recommended by the Skeen Committee in 1927. The number would probably he small, but might not be negligible even after the &quot; Indian Sandhurst &quot; has been opened. Secondly, it will take a little time before a regular flow of Indian officers from regimental into staff, command and ancillary appointments can be established
3. 1and maintained. For the first few years these officers will have to continue serving in their regiments. For these reasons the initial intake might be slightly reduced for the earlier years with the prospect that it would be readjusted whenever a higher rate is justified. But the margin of wastage from the Indian College into civil careers, &amp;c, will probably be large enough to make an intake of 60 safe, and this figure could reasonably be accepted.9. It is understood that the Indian States are likely to ask for a fairly large number of vacancies, and whatever figure may be decided, it will have to be added by the Government of India and the Committee of Experts. So far as the intake from British India is concerned, the College might be designed to accommodate 200 cadets. Allowing for a three years&apos; course, this would provide an output of 60 a year with a suitable margin for expansion in future. It is suggested, therefore, that the Government of India should be authorised forthwith to inform the Committee of Experts (1) that the &quot;Indian Sandhurst&quot; should be designed to take 200 cadets in all from British India, in addition to whatever total number may be provided for the Indian States; and (2) that at the start the intake from British India should befixed at 60.-10. At the same time it is highly important to safeguard the continuity of British recruitment for the Indian Army. A bare announcement that the new Indian Military College is to absorb 60 students a year, with the implication that most of these will pass into the Indian Army, would undoubtedly prejudice British recruitment. There was a very marked decline in 1927 during the interval between the publication of the Indian Sandhurst Committee&apos;s Report and the announcement of the Governments decisions thereon. The Government of India themselves have had it in mind to present their Committee with the entire scheme, including both the rate and the scope of Indianisation, as soon as they obtain His Majesty&apos;s Governments approval. This is not what was intended in the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of the 11th February 1931 ; and in any case it would hardly give enough time for proper examination of the whole scheme on its merits. But the Government of India should at any rate indicate to the Committee and to the public that they are proceeding in consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government on the general lines which they have already disclosed in their Despatch of September 1930, that is to say, that Indianisation is to advance within self-contained Army formations which are gradually to be developed within the Indian Army. This should serve to show that there is no intention of departing from the policy of Indianising within selected units, and to that extent to reassure British candidates for the Indian Army who would otherwise be-left in uncertainty as to their future. There was a consensus of opinion in the Defence Sub-Committee of the Round Table Conference that the recommendations of what is known as the &quot; Shea Committee&quot; of 1921-2, a summary of which has since been published in India, should be taken as the basis of Indianisation. Those recommendations- definitely provided for Indianisation within selected units.11. The chief feature of the Government of India&apos;s scheme that remains to be considered is the proposal to form units to be manned eventually by Indian officers and other ranks, in branches of the Service such as Horse and Field Artillery Batteries and Armoured Car Companies. It presents two main questions for consideration : (a) the general question of principle, (6) the particular question of the process to be adopted.12. (a) It cannot be said that there is any explicit decision on record by His Majesty&apos;s Government either in the sense that there need now be no bar to the employment of Indians in any branch of the Army or with any type of armament used in India, or in the sense that some limit must be set to their employment in this connection. For convenience of reference, a Note is appended which summarises App. II. the previous decisions in regard to Indianisation in so far as they bear on this particular question. A decision on the matter has now to be taken. The cardinal points in favour of definitely discarding any broad policy of exclusion are (1) that it would be wholly inconsistent with the principle of mutual trust which is inherent in the general policy that His Majesty Government are pursuing in regard to India, (2) that the Government of India&apos;s proposals have behind them the high authority of the Commander-in-Chief, (3) that the policy of forming an Indian Air Force affords a precedent which makes it virtually impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to say, &quot;Tims far and no further.&quot;
13. (b) The Government of India&apos;s explanation in para. 6 of their air mail letter of the process by which they intend to introduce Indianisation into these technical App. III.      branches has been amplified in the telegraphic correspondence which is appended.It may be explained that the &quot; reinforcement Artillery Brigade at Bangalore,&quot; to which the Government of India refer in the first paragraph of their telegram of the 12th May, consists of four batteries, which retain their identity in name, but are maintained at a strength below establishment and for practical purposes are merged into two batteries, although they could be re-expanded into four if occasion arose. The details of the process, and their possible reactions on the British and Indian Armies respectively, will no doubt have to be carefully considered by the experts concerned. But even if the matter should be found to present technical difficulties, their exploration need not delay a decision on the broad outlines of the Government of India&apos;s scheme as a whole.India Office,29th June 1931.W. B.
Express Letter (Air Mail) from Government of India, Army Department, No. 155, to Secretary of State for India, dated New Delhi, 2nd/6th April 1931.Reference oar telegram 441 S., dated the 14th February 1931, we submit herewith the considered proposals of the Commander-in-Chief for increase in Indianisation in officer ranks of Indian Army.2. Hitherto, Indianisation has been confined to a few individual units of Cavalry, Infantry and Pioneers, and a few individual vacancies at Woolwich and Cranwell recently opened to Indians with a view to the formation of one or two mountain batteries of Artillery, a field company of Sappers and Miners, and an Air Force unit beginning with one Flight and expanding gradually to a Squadron. No attempt has yet been made to create a recognised formation on a purely Indian basis. The Round-Table Conference and His Majesty&apos;s Government have accepted the policy that the defence of India must to an increasing extent be the concern of the Indian people. An essential part of that policy must be in our opinion the gradual creation of war formations of a strength and composition similar to the war formations of the Home and Dominion Armies, equipped and trained on identical lines, and capable of taking their place in an Imperial Field Force, and eventually of assuming responsibility for the defence of India in normal times ; for even under present conditions the army in India looks to Great Britain for reinforcement in the event of a war of the first magnitude.3. We need not emphasise the fact that a measure of reorganisation such as is now anticipated must inevitably cause considerable derangement in the organisation of the Indian Army, have varied reactions on the prospects of individuals, and tend to reduce the fighting efficiency of the army as a whole. Meanwhile, there is no guarantee that the menace of disturbances on the frontier, or even of aggression by a foreign Power, will be removed during the process, not to mention the possibility of widespread disturbances in India itself. We invite attention in this connection to the following passages from the correspondence over the Indian Sandhurst Committee&apos;s Report: (a) Para. 5 (end) of the Government of India&apos;s telegram No. 1473 S., dated the Reproduced18th July 1927. mAPP. IV.(b) Para. 13 of the Secretary of State&apos;s Military Despatch No.  6, dated the 5th April 1928.4. The method and scope of Indianisation must therefore be so regulated as. not to endanger the security of India during the process, and not to dislocate, more than is absolutely necessary, the position and prospects of individual British and Indian officers already in the service. We are thinking here particularly of the Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers, and of the sowars and sepoys who have hitherto looked forward to the Viceroy&apos;s commission as their goal.5. With these principles in mind, the Commander-in-Chief has given the most careful consideration to the whole question, and now puts forward a definite proposal that the field of Indianisation during the next stage of expansion should consist of a complete Indianised War Division with its full complement of Artillery (two brigades of Field Artillery and one brigade of Mountain Artillery), Engineers (Sappers and Miners), Pioneers and Signals, as well as a Cavalry brigade with a battery of Horse Artillery, and that recruitment of Indians should be made also with a view to completing the requisite complement of Staff appointments, Indian Army Service Corps, Indian Army Ordnance Corps, Military Engineering Services, Remounts, Farms, &amp;c. He proposes also that provision should be made in our recruitment for officering two Armoured Car companies.   We accept these proposals.6. Before proceeding further to discuss our main proposals we think it desirable to explain in detail our method of Indianisation in the technical arms, which constitute the most novel feature of our scheme. The horse and field batteries will be formed by raising batteries officered, in the first instance, by British officers who volunteer as for present mountain batteries and who will gradually be replaced from bottom, by Indiaus. The same applies to the British mountain battery which is to be replaced. Rank and. file will be found by replacement of British other ranks where required by Indian other ranks selected from existing mountain batteries and from
Indian drivers of field batteries, a quota of British non-commissioned officers bein&quot;-temporarily retained on lines now practised in Sapper and Miner companies. The remaining- other ranks when trained will be substituted en bloc for British other ranks, excluding such British non-commissioned officers as are retained. This measure will coincide with the first posting of Indian commissioned officers to the battery concerned. Horses and equipment will be taken over from the existino-British batteries. Similarly for Armoured Car companies officers will be found by secondment and personnel by selection from personnel now serving with Indian units and by recruitment. Normal process of Indianisation as in Cavalry and Infantry will be followed for Sapper and Miner companies and for Indian mountain batteries.7. It does not follow that it will be necessary to wait until the first batch of Indians commissioned under the new scheme have reached 25 or 26 years&apos; service before deciding on the next step, as has sometimes been suggested. By the time that Indian commissioned officers who have how seven years&apos; service have completed another 12 or 14 years they will be approaching the stage of command of units, while those who join now will be similarly approaching the stage of Squadron or Company Command. By then we should be able to tell with practical certainty whether they have made good or not. If they have made good it would&apos;be then possible to contemplate a farther large expansion.8. According to figures which we have had worked out, the new Indianised force should absorb an establishment of 874 officers, which could be built up by an annual intake of 53 in 17 years, unless, as suggested in the previous paragraph, the rate has in the meanwhile been increased. The first batch of entrants iuto the army under the new system should be commissioned in 1935 or 1936, i.e. three years after the inauguration of the Indian Military College. We think it would be safe to announce a round number of 60 as the annual intake that we could aim at from British India for&apos;the Indian Military College. This figure would include the Air Force cadets required for the building up of the Indian Air Squadron, but would exclude the number of cadets to be trained for Indian Slate Forces. We can only estimate the latter number when we have heard what the representatives of Indian States on the Expert Committee have to say.9. All questions relating to the method of selection of cadets, details of the-entrance examination, nominations, the curriculum, staff, accommodation and locality, &amp;c, of the Indian College must be left for the present until the Expert Committee sits.10. We turn now to the question of the conversion of the officer establishment of Indianising units to the British pattern, aud the consequent elimination of A^iceroj^s commissioned officers. In paras. 3 and 4 of your predecessors telegram No. 362G,. dated 25th December 1927, it was stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government considered that units should be organised on the model of British battalions with homogeneous officer establishments, and that it would be proper to make the consequent change to a Dominion type of commission immediately as the number of Indians holding the full King&apos;s commission was then still small. As a result of further correspondence His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed that the change in form of commission shoidd be postponed to the stage at which a steady supply of Indian officers in increasing numbers appeared to be assured and some at least of the Indianising units were completely organised on the British pattern or on a fair wray to becoming so. As we had already indicated, the reorganisation of officer establishment and change of type of commission would naturally occur simultaneously with the first output of Indian officers from the Indian Military-College. We adhere to this view, and also recommend that displacement of Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers should only begin in 1936 or 1937, when the first batch of officers from Indian Military College may be expected to join Indian units after a year of attachment to British units. We need not reiterate in full arguments previously put forward for necessity of homogeneous officer establishments in Tndianising units, but would add the following : First.-Output of about 60 Indian full commissioned officers a year from Indian Military College would compel us to extend Indianisation forthwith to approximately 50 per cent, of Indian Army units, excluding Gurkha battalions, if Indians were merely to take the place of British King&apos;s commissioned officers. This would mean abandonment of conditions laid down in para. 4 above. We need not point out that such a measure would bring to immediate end all British recruitment for officer ranks of Indian Arrny.
I 7.Second. On completion of process of Indianisation, unit officer establishment, would consist of 12 full commissioned Indian officers of various classes from Indian Military College and 19 Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers belonging to same fighting races as rank and file. Latter officers, by reason of their age, long service, military record, race and traditions, would inevitably dominate unit organisation, which is at present based on personal ascendancy of a few British officers at the top.Third. Homogeneous officer establishment is essential feature of Shea Committee&apos;s scheme, on which proposals both of Round-Table Conference and ourselves are based.At the same time we recognise the paramount importance of assuring Iudian other ranks and races from which they are drawn prospects of advancement no less attractive than they now enjoy. Postponement of reorganisation of units to British pattern until 1936 or 1937 would enable us to familiarise Indian personnel with changed conditions and to devise arrangements by which military prospects of these classes as a whole will not be seriously impaired. Commander-in-Chief wishes to emphasise that he personally could contemplate no scheme of Indianisation which involved retention of Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers.11. We have to consider the question of cost of our proposals. We must remember that schemes of Indianisation advanced in 1921 owed their origiu mainly to expressed popular desire for retrenchment of cost of Army in India, and that although national aspirations have assumed more prominent place in subsequent discussions, and although we understand feeling at Round-Table Conference to have been that questions of cost were of subsidiary importance in considering the right of India to undertake in increasing measure the responsibility for her own defence, economic arguments are from Indian point of view still an important factor, and have become particularly so in present financial position and prospects. We think it desirable to state at the outset that development of Indianisation on lines contemplated in whatever field may be selected for that purpose will lead to no appreciable economy while the process is taking place. On the contrary, as was pointed out in para. 5 of Government of Iudia&apos;s telegram No. 1473 S., dated the 18th July 1927, and endorsed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in para. 13 of your predecessors Despatch, No. 6, Military, dated the 5th April 1928, Indianisation of a portion of Indian Army will lead to increased expense if it diminishes efficiency of army as a whole for war, and thereby renders additions to strength necessary. If scales of pay for Indian officers under new S3&apos;stem remain based on British officers&apos; scales, allowing only for reduction by overseas element, cost of officer establishment of each completely Tndianised unit under our proposals would be increased by approximately Rs. 50,000 per annum. On the other hand, if new scales of pay were related rather to standard of Provincial Civil Services, cost of unit establishments could be brought down to or even below present total cost of 12 British officers and 19 Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers. We consider that whole question of future pay of Indian commissioned officer ranks should be considered in detail by the Expert Committee. Establishment of College will of coarse involve considerable capital and recurring expenditure, which must, however, be faced.12. As we have shown, our Indianisation proposals will not in themselves meet popular demand for reduction of military expenditure of India. Such reduction can only be found from other sources, e.g. by contribution of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards defence of India, or reduction in total strength of Army in India, or substitution of Indian for British troops. All these are matters for separate consideration and decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government in connection with proceedings and recommendations of Itound-Table Conference. We think it essential that they should be regarded as altogether distinct from the question of Indianisation of officer ranks..13. At a later stage, reorganisation of Indianising units on British pattern will involve questions of quartering and possibly localisation of certain units. These need not, however, be pursued at the present stage. It will be time enough to form decisions on them when the flow of officers from Indian Military College is about to begin.14. As our proposals must inevitably result, for some time at any rate, in reduced efficiency for war, in the Army in India, we desire to draw attention of His Majesty&apos;s
Government, to.para. 3 of the Defence Sub-Committee&apos;s Report, which emphasises the responsibility of the Crown through the Committee of Imperial Defence for the defence of India. The temporary inefficiency may result in the War Office having to contemplate larger reinforcements for India, in certain events, than they have hitherto thought necessary. We ask, therefore, that the proposals be referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence before His Majesty&apos;s Government give their final approval, the Committee of Imperial Defence being informed that we and the Commander-in-Chief personally are prepared to take the risk which our proposals entail.J. 11: Bl.au;, for Secretary to the Government of India.
/I 1 4 * 1 J.APPENDICES.APPENDIX I.Extract from the Government of India&apos;s Despatch on Proposals for Constitutional Reform,dated Simla, the 20th September 1930.160. Number of Indianising units required. An annual output of 20 officers with direct commissions from Sandhurst, together with an annual average of two or three Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers granted King&apos;s commissions, will in the course of time supply an officer establishment sufficient for a complete Infantry division of 12 battalions, a Pioneer battalion, and a brigade of three regiments of Cavalry, together with an adequate margin for ancillary departments, staff and command appointments, and for wastage in premature retirements and transfers to civil departments. The calculation assumes the conversion of the officer establishment of Indian units from the existing pattern, which consists of 12 to 14King&apos;s commissioned officers and 19 or 20 Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers, to a homogeneous cadre of 23 to 25 King&apos;s commissioned officers. Our scheme, therefore, at its present stage, envisages the Indianisation in all of 16 units of Cavalry, Infantry and Pioneers, in addition to such units of Artillery, Signals and Engineers as may hereafter be officered by Indians from Woolwich, and to the Air squadron which we hope to raise gradually with Indian officers trained at Granwell. The eight units hitherto set apart for Indianisation are still officered on the pattern mentioned above. But these officer establishments will in the course of time be insufficient to accommodate the increasing number of Indians commissioned through Sandhurst. It will then be necessary either to set apart more units for Indianisation or to begin the conversion of the officer establishment to the British pattern, or to introduce a combination of both these measures. We have not yet decided which procedure we shall adopt. An important factor in the decision must naturally be the necessity of securing the rights and prospects of the Yiceroy&apos;s commissioned officers, and of the sepoys and sowars who enter the army with the ambition of being promoted to Viceroy&apos;s commissioned rank.161. Question of an Indian Military College. The increasing numbers of successful Indian candidates at these examinations bring tis nearer to the point when the question of the establishment of a Military College in India must be decided. The Indian Sandhurst Committee, in para. 41 of their report, stated that according to the expert evidence they had received, the desirable number of candidates for the starting of an Indian Military College, if it were to have an efficient organisation, was. 100. They accepted that as the initial number, and proposed that the College should be inaugurated in 1933, with an intake of 33 cadets in that year. The establishment of 100 was to be reached in 1935, when the first batch of entrants would be commencing the third and last year of their course. The Committee, in their recommendations, followed the models provided by the Dominion Military Colleges, at Kingston and Duntroon, where the normal course of training is three or four years ; and we agree that the Indian Military College when established shotild be on the lines of those Colleges rather than of Sandhurst, where the course lasts for 18 months only. We also agree with the Indian Sandhurst Committee that 100 is a desirable number, though not an indispensable minimum, for the foundation of an Indian Military College. To absorb an annual output of 33 officers, if that were the figure accepted, it would be necessary in course of time to expand the number of units selected for Indianisation from 16, the number required for the present output, up to about 25. The rate of progress of Indianisation in Artillery, Engineers, Signals and Air units is at present too uncertain to be included in this estimate.APPENDIX II.Since Indians were first admitted to commissioned rank in the Army in 1918, it has never been definitely stated by His Majesty&apos;s Government that their admission to the technical branches must be circumscribed for  reasons  of  safety... Broadly speaking, the policy of His Majesty:s Government during the last 12 years has been 49 &quot; B
that Indianisation in the Army is an experiment, and that the introduction of each new si age should depend on the success of the last. There has been no clear-cut ruling to the effect that Indianisation must not in any event proceed beyond a given stage.For the sake of clearness, three alternatives may be distinguished : (A) The admission of Indians to all branches of His Majesty&apos;s forces withoutlimit ;(B) Their admission to those branches which are or may be normally employedin India ;(C) Their admission to those branches alone which form or may form part of theIndian Army and similar Indian fighting services, such as the Royal Indian Marine and the prospective Indian Air Force. In these branches the personnel is or will be ordinarily Indian.In November 1918 the Government of India stated that in their view &quot;All positions assigned to officers and those allotted to skilled non-commissioned officers and men, other than workshop ratings, should be filled entirely by Europeans, viz. Royal Air Force; Royal Engineers, other than Indian Sappers and Miners units ; Royal Artillery other that Frontier, Garrison and Indian Mountain Artillery ; Machine Gun Corps, including Armoured Motor batteries other than in Frontier Brigades ; Trench Howitzer units; and Wireless Telegraphists whether in the Civil Service or in the Indian Telegraph Department.&quot;In a despatch dated 1st September 1921 the Government of India definitely abandoned this view. They had accepted (or at least not opposed) an Assembly Resolution on the 28th March 1921 to the effect &quot; that the King-Emperor&apos;s Indian subjects should be freely admitted to all arms of His Majesty&apos;s Military, Naval and Air Forces in India and the ancillary services and the auxiliary forces &quot; ;and they made proposals to give it effect, including the admission of Indians as officers &quot;in the Royal Air Force for service in India.&quot; They thus favoured alternative (B).This despatch was followed by the Report of an expert Committee in India, appointed by the Commander-in-Chief, dated 11th January 1922. It recommended a programme of Indianisation extending over 42 years. The Report apparently, though not explicitly, proceeded on the basis of alternative (C); i.e. it recommended Indianisation in Cavalry, Infantry, Pioneers, Pack Batteries, and &quot; Engineer units &quot;  presumably Sappers and Miners. Nothing was said about Field Artillery (which is in British hands) or the Royal Air Force.Both the despatch and the Report were referred to a special Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, which at the time was considering the strength and organisation of the Army in India as a whole. The conclusions of the Sub-Committee on Indianisation, which were accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, are stated in paras. 117 to 130 of Committee of Imperial Defence, Paper No. 130 D., dated 26th January 1923. The line taken in this Report is, as stated above, that Indianisation was an experiment which must proceed by successive stages. It should he initiated by Indianising eight selected units of Cavalry, Infantry and Pioneers. The Report did not refer to the proposed admission of Indians to the technical branches, nor&apos;did it contain anything to the effect that admission to these branches must be rejected or restricted on grounds of policy. It implied rather that a beginning must be made in the Cavalry, Infantry and Pioneers alone. This was made explicit in a telegram from the Secretary of State, dated 20th February 1923: &quot; You will no doubt realise that the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding Indianisation covers all proposals made on this subject, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government are therefore unable to sanction the proposals contained in your Despatch of 1st September 1921.&quot;About this time, however, the Government of India had separately recommended the grant of a limited amount of artillery to the military forces of certain Native
States. On this occasion the proposal was rejected on the ground that the grant of modern artillery to the States &apos;: would be followed by a claim for the equipment of the Indian Army (consisting of Indian troops) with similar artillery a claim which it would theu be difficult to resist,&quot;and which presumably His Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared to admit. This decision was repeated in a despatch from the Secretary of State, dated 28th May, which added &quot; Other considerations, which I need not on this occasion elaborate, also entered into the case for example, the maintenance of the fundamental principle hitherto governing military policy in India, viz. that Field Artillery in the Army should be retained wholly in British hands.&quot;The next step as regards Indianisation was the receipt of the Government of Tndia&apos;s Despatch of the 24th July 1924, which repeated in effect the proposals of 1921, with modifications in form. This time they inclined towards alternative (Cj, i.e. the admission of Indians to exclusively Indian Services.A draft reply was prepared and approved by the Secretary of State in Council, which adhered to the decision of 1923. Once again the proposed admission of Indians to the technical branches was negatived, not because this was held to be unsafe, but on the broad ground that Indianisation must proceed stage by stage. The despatch did not, however, issue, as it was superseded by the Government of India&apos;s proposal to appoint the Indian Sandhurst Committee. This was in the summer of 1925.The Government of India made their recommendations on the Indian Sandhurst Committee Report in 1927. They again proposed the admission of Indians to the technical branches; but this time there was no ambiguity on the question whether such admission should be confined to branches of the Indian Service. The root of the policy was the formation of the nucleus of a &quot; Dominion Army,&quot; in which British Service units could have no place. His Majesty&apos;s Government accepted practically the whole of the Government of India&apos;s proposals. In doing so they recorded the following views : &quot;In principle there is no objection to the admission of a limited number of Indians to Woolwich, provided that the British standard of admission to, and proficiency at, Woolwich is rigidly insisted on.&quot;&quot; We consider that there is no objection in principle to the admission of Indians to Cranwell.&quot;   (CP. 326/27, paras. 27 and 28.)The underlying assumption was that Indians trained at Woolwich or at Cranwell would be destined for Artillery, Engineer or Signal units of the Indian Army or for a separate Indian Air Force. Again, nothing wras said to imply that the admission of Indians to these technical branches, on that assumption, must be restricted on grounds of policj7.APPENDIX III.Paraphrase of a Telegram from the Secretary of State to the Government of India,dated 2nd May 1931.1419. Indianisation of Indian Army. Your express letter dated 6th April,, para. 6. As I should like to be sure of what you intend before proceeding with discussions with War Office, please telegraph whether you contemplate (1) that certain British Service units, such as field batteries, now on Indian establishment,: should be earmarked for conversion into Indian, Army units while retaining necessary British personnel on volunteer basis, such conversion to take place at point when Indian officers are first posted to these units and Indian other ranks are substituted for British other ranks, or (2) that Indian other ranks should be selected and attached for training to British Service units now on the Indian establishment, and when trained should be formed into new units with volunteer British personnel as above, 49 C
or (3) that new units with British personnel as above should be raised outside existing establishment on analogy of new Indian Air Force.(1) would involve definite transfer of units from Imperial to Indian Army in the near future ; (2) and (3) would involve eventual withdrawal (on usual notice to War Office) of British Service units and their replacement by new Indian Army units ; (3) would involve greater initial expenditure in maintenance of units outside present establishment, as compared with cost of maintaining supernumerary personnel within the establishment.Paraphrase of a Telegram from the Government of India, dated the 12th May 1931.1318 S. Reply to questions in your telegram of the 2nd instant, 1419, is as follows: Firstly, as regards Field Artillery, we envisage formation of Indian batteries practically on lines of alternative 2 of your wire. First step is to earmark British batteries for replacement on Indian establishment by Indian batteries ; second, to attach Indian other ranks for instruction to British batteries ; third, to concentrate Indian personnel when it has been so trained into some of these batteries, retaining in them quota of British non-commissioned officers on volunteer basis; fourth, to eliminate British volunteers by substituting Indians. Stage at which new Indian unit will come into being is number 3, when simul-taneously the British battery will be amalgamated with another battery in the same brigade, Avhile such British personnel as is not retained on volunteer basis will be absorbed on same system as now exists in Bangalore reinforcement brigade. Identity of all British units will thus be retained. It will be seen that formation of Indian battery need not wait until Indian officers are actually posted. British officers will be retained on system already followed in the case of Indian mountain batteries or possibly as seconded officers.2. We propose as regards officers to start by Indianising subaltern ranks in selected Indian mountain batteries, and in the second place when Indian field batteries as described above have been formed, to replace British subalterns by transfers from Indian mountain batteries and by Indian officers from Indian Military ;Oollege. We cannot forecast the rate at which this will proceed since it will depend not only upon number of qualified candidates, but also upon flow of promotion and cadre considerations generally.As Indian Military College Committee meets on 25th of this month, we trust that a very early decision will be reached on our main proposals.APPENDIX IV.Extract from Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, dated 18th July 1927.We consider that it must be recognised from the beginning that completely Indianised units of Cavalry, Infantry and Pioneers may prove less efficient than British officered units, and, if so, that when time comes the resulting deficiency in the forces available for the defence of India must be made good, either by additional British troops or by additional Indian troops with British officers.Extract from Government of India&apos;s despatch No. 38 of 1927.18. We trust that His Majesty&apos;s Government will give early and sympathetic consideration to our proposals. The problem is one of great complexity and has remained too long unsolved. We have endeavoured to avoid the error of submitting proposals for increased Indianisation without fully estimating the implications of -such proposals. Our aim is to design a structure, based on clear principles, which will successfully function when complete, and involve a minimum of risk while it is being built up. As we observed in our telegram, if Indianisation means a loss of efficiency, that loss must be made good in other ways. Our Army at its present strength barely suffices for the external and internal defences of the country. The outlook on our frontiers is not without anxiety ; in India the communal situation has
probably never been more strained. We have received from almost every Local Government a demand for an increase of troops for internal security purposes. The Indianisation of the officer ranks of the Indian Army manifestly involves a great experiment and a great change. We cannot afford to make that experiment with the Indian Army as- a whole. By providing for the gradual evolution of a distinctive Indian officered force comprising all arms we hope not only to initiate progress upon the right lines, but also to appeal to the patriotism of Indians of the educated classes, and evoke in them a more widespread and genuine desire to bear arms in defence of their country than can be said to exist at present.Extract from Despatch to Government of India, No. 6 of 1928.13. In conclusion, I desire to record my concurrence and that of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the observations expressed in para. 18 of Your Excellency&apos;s Despatch. In particular, His Majesty&apos;s Government attach great importance to the recognition that any deficiency in the forces available for the defence of India, due to lesser efficiency of completely Indianised units, must be made good either by additional British troops or by additional Indian troops with British officers. The experiment to which we are committed is fraught with grave difficulties and it is the more incumbent tipon us to remove, as far as possible, any element of actual danger. His Majesty&apos;s Government, while not concealing from themselves that certain risks will have to be faced, are satisfied that the proposals of Your Excellency&apos;s Government afford, in the main, the most practical solution of a formidable problem. On this understanding they are willing that the experiment should go forward, as the best method of giving effect to the policy of encouraging Indians to share the burden of the defence of India to the full extent which His Majesty&apos;s Government, in consultation with Your Excellency&apos;s Government, judge to be compatible with safety at each stage.
