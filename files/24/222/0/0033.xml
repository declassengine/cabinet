THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1931.SECRET. Copy No.     5CP. 183 (31).CABINET.THREATENED INTERRUPTION OF THE OPERATION OF THE ENGLAND-INDIA AIR SERVICE BETWEEN BASRAH AND KARACHI.(A) The Present Situation.1. I FEEL it necessary to bring before the Cabinet as a matter of urgency the very difficult situation which has arisen vis-a-vis Persia in connection with the Indian Air Service. I would remind my colleagues that the air route to India is the key trunk route of the Empire, since, important as it is of itself, it constitutes also the first stage of the route to the Straits Settlements and Australia.   Its whole future is now endangered by.Persian intransigence.We have had one international difficulty after another in the organisation of this route, and it is most unfortunate that, when at length we have succeeded in negotiating satisfactory long-term agreements with Italy and Greece safe-guarding its operation across Europe, this even more serious complication should be threatening our hard-won security.2. The service is at present operated along the northern (or eastern) shore of the Persian Gulf, with halts en route at three points in Persian territory, viz., Bushire, Lingah and Jask. It was only after difficult and protracted negotia-tions that the Persian Government consented to give facilities for the use of this coastal route, and, when doing so in 1928, they insisted that their permit to Imperial Airways must be for 3 years only. They were prepared to consider the grant of facilities thereafter to operate via a route across Central Persia (though they gave no positive undertaking as to this), but declared they would in no circumstances renew or extend the permit to fly along the shore of the Gulf.The three-year period runs out in eight months&apos; time, i.e., at the end of March 1932.3. All that we seek is the right of peaceful transit for civil machines only, with but three landings in Persian territory at grounds which were originally prepared and equipped with wireless stations, &amp;c, to a large extent at our charges. The Persian attitude is, therefore, unreasonable in the extreme, though doubtless it has its roots to a large extent in their longstanding dislike of the position which Great Britain has built up for herself in the Gulf, which is now pointed by their new national self-consciousness. At all events, the Air Ministry is advised by the Foreign Office that the present mood of the existing Persian regime is such that, if they persist, we have no option but to accept the situation, seeing that Persia has never ratified her accession to the International Air Traffic Convention. Further, the Foreign Office are reluctant to approach the Persian Government at all in present circumstances, as they hold that to do so, in the absence of any lever on our side, would be to court a refusal with all its consequential embarrassments.4. I should add that the French and Dutch are also at present operating-services over the same route along the Persian coast and that their permits are due to expire 3 months before our own. The Foreign Office advise that the French and Dutch Governments should be left to take the initiative in opening negotiations with the Persian Government for an extension of their permits, and that we should not at this juncture attempt a joint demarche, as our association with them would be likely to hinder rather than help matters. It has, however, been agreed that Imperial Airways can approach the French and Dutch Air Transport Companies concerned informally and unofficially and enquire of them[5769]
what they propose doing, which may lead to some move on their part. This may or may not in due course clarify the situation, but time presses, and it is the view of the Foreign Office that, even if the French and Dutch permits are extended, it is possible, if not probable, that the Persians will refuse a similar extension to ourselves, and that, if they do so, we shall have no remedy even in the teeth of such glaring discrimination against Great Britain, in view of Persia&apos;s failure to ratify the Air Traffic Convention. We appear, in short, to be in a state of complete impotence vis-a-vis Persia.5. If a satisfactory alternative route were available the matter would, perhaps, not be of very great moment. The trouble is that there is no satisfactory alternative. The route through Central Persia has just been surveyed by a representative of Imperial Airways, and unfortunately his report is definitely adverse. He advises that it is impracticable, owing primarily to (a) the height of the mountains to be traversed and (b) the unsuitability of the route for operation in winter, whilst (c) it appears that it would be very costly to transport supplies of petrol to the necessary aerodromes. He states that Sir P. Clive expressed the view that the route was &quot;preposterous,&quot; crossing as it does high mountain ranges, entailing flight at an altitude of 13,000 feet winter and summer, and generally operation over a terrain so rough that for stretches hundreds of miles in extent there is no possibility of a safe forced landing. Nor are there any telegraphic communications available. He further reports that the head of the Persian Air Force frankly admitted to him that the route was impossible for commercial operation, and undertook to say as much to the Persian authorities. He adds that he is satisfied (and Sir R. Clive confirms) that there is no practicable alternative route across Central Persia. Lest the point be queried, I had, perhaps, better explain that the Junkers services at present in operation in Persia do not fly over this route, and that they are, in any event, able to use for their limited operations a much smaller and lighter type of aircraft which can land in a restricted space. Even so, these services suffer from great irregularity, particularly in the winter, when engines are liable to freeze up, and a machine, once on the ground, has great difficulty in getting into the air again.8. The only other route lies along the Arabian coast of the Gulf, which is for the most part barren, inhospitable and uncivilised. The terrain is more difficult and the climate is reported to be hotter in summer than on the Persian side, and generally there is, (except perhaps at Bahrein), a lack of facilities and amenities for civilian passengers, which could, however, be remedied without much difficulty. This route is at present in process of being opened up by the Royal Air Force for strategic purposes, but it is not yet fully organised, and even here potential obstacles have been encountered in the shape of opposition by at least one petty Arab potentate the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah.If Imperial Airways are compelled to use this route along the Arabian coast, it will mean, I fear, a slowing down of their existing time-table to India, with consequent loss of traffic, and it will almost certainly be necessary to operate this section by flying boats, instead of by land planes as at present, which will entail increased expense.7. Nevertheless, in the impasse in which we find ourselves, I see no alter-native, if the Foreign Office view be accepted, but to press on with the organisation of this latter route, which will take several months to prepare. But here we are faced with a new complication. The India Office, whilst fully recognising that it is essential to find some solution which will permit of the continued operation of the Indian service, are of the opinion that there are serious political objections to the use of this Arabian route for regular civil purposes. The difficulty lies primarily in that section which runs through the territory of the Trucial Chiefs. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is also opposed to the use of this route and stresses the fact that these Chiefs have always looked askance at the develop-ment of an air route through their territory, objecting in particular to the ideaof a civil air service. The India Office point out that our policy has consistently been to abstain from any commitments by land in the territory of these Chiefs. They are advised that if a civil air route is put into operation it would probably be necessary to station troops in the areas affected for the protection of the route. This would represent a very important change of policy and might have far-
,1S J? V8. In sum then, the situation as regards the only three alternative routes is as follows : (a) Persian Coastal Route.This route, which is that at present in operation, is undoubtedly far preferable to any other on grounds alike of safety, operational convenience and expense. The present permit to Imperial Airways to operate along the Persian coast expires, however, on the 31st March, 1932, and the Foreign Office have repeatedly advised that in their opinion there is virtually no hope of an extension.   They are further, in view of Persia&apos;s original warning,reaching consequences. Failing such protection, it would be impossible to guarantee the safety of the rest-house or refuelling point, and there would be the risk of an incident sooner or later which would necessitate active and armed intervention on our part. They further represent that our own position on the Trucial Coast is a delicate one, and that with the establishment of a civil air route it would be impossible to maintain our present policy of excluding foreigners or even, presumably, foreign aircraft. This is in their view an important consideration, especially as their advent would involve great additional risk of incidents and of the consequent necessity of armed British intervention for the protection of such foreigners.The India Office would therefore favour a further effort being made to secure an extension from the Persians.Quite clearly great weight must attach to the India Office view in this matter, but I would stress that, if the service is operated (as is proposed) by flying boats, it would only be necessary to have one intermediate landing place on the Trucial Coast, viz., at Ras-al-Khaimah or alternatively at Umm-al-Kaiwain, 25 miles to the South, which offers superior facilities for flying boats, but so far has not been generally used by the Royal Air Force, owing to the British agent being established at Ras-al-Khaimah. Unfortunately, the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah has been one of the most strenuous objectors to the opening up even of a military air route, though his attitude has been one of &quot;passive resistance&quot; and aircraft of the Royal Air Force have in fact made frequent use of his territory. I should hope, therefore, though I hesitate to express too definite an opinion on the point, that it might be possible to hold out to him some relatively small financial induce-ment which would cause him to modify his present attitude. I am further advised by senior officers of the Royal Air Force with first-hand knowledge of the local situation that in their view, (which, however, is not shared by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who is responsible for our relations with the Sheikhs in question), there is little danger of serious trouble, if we are prepared to take a firm line. Further, it might be possible to have as rest-house a small shallow-draught vessel, such as those already successfully employed for this purpose by Imperial Airways in the Mediterranean, which could be moored at the place selected; and in this event the Air Staff, as at present advised, consider that troops would not be required for its protection, but that a small armed guard (which could be provided at negligible cost) would suffice. In this connexion I may perhaps remind my colleagues that, after full investigation and consideration by an authoritative Committee, it has been fully recognised that a military air route along the Arabian coast of the Gulf is a vital Imperial necessity. The organisation of a civil air route would therefore have a definite strategic value. As regards the question of foreign aircraft using this route, the French and Dutch services are at present operated with land planes. If it is accepted that Imperial Airways must use flying boats for operating down the Arabian coast, the Air Ministry view, (which I believe to be shared by the Foreign Office), is that we should be justified in withholding facilities from the French and the Dutch, unless and until they also utilise flying boats. If they do this, we could hardly deny them the use of our facilities, but in view of the importance of securing at all costs the maintenance of our own Indian service, the Air Staff consider that this situation must be accepted. Indeed, if the French and Dutch desired to operate a flying boat service down the Arabian coast at their own risk, irrespective of anything we might be doing, themselves providing the very modest ground facilities required, it is difficult to see how this could be prevented.(B) Summary and Recommendations for Action.
when granting the concession, of her subsequent attitude, and of the fact that she has never ratified the International Air Traffic Convention, averse from approaching the Persians with a request of this nature, which, particularly in the absence of any lever on our side, would be certain to be refused.(b) Central Persian Route.The route through Central Persia prescribed by the Persian Government has been surveyed and reported on as commercially and operationally impracticable, and there appears to be no other inland route possible.(c) The Arabian Coast Route.This appears feasible, if satisfactory arrangements can be come to with the Sheikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah or Umm-al-Kaiwain, but to open it up may entail, in the opinion of the India Office, serious political drawbacks, whilst it is longer, on the whole, more difficult of operation, less comfortable foi passengers and definitely more costly.9. With these conflicting considerations and the divergent views held by the Foreign Office and the India Office, it is very difficult for me to present to my colleagues any clear-cut recommendation. I presume it can be premised that somehow or other the continued operation of this route must be secured; to abandon the Indian service a service which is bound to grow steadily in importance with the passage of time is, in my view, unthinkable, and would react on our prestige throughout the whole of the East. If this situation is to be avoided, some action must be taken and taken immediately. The question is what that action should be, and it is on this that I am anxious to take counsel with my colleagues as a matter of urgency. My own tentative recommendations are as under : (1) If it is not possible to take further diplomatic action with Persia at the present juncture through official channels for an extension of the present permit on a firm basis, then arrangements should be made for Imperial Airways to approach the Persian Government forthwith as a matter of ordinary commercial negotiation. It seems incumbent upon us to notify the Persian Government that a careful survey has now shown the Central Persian route to be impracticable, and, in doing so, it would appear natural and inevitable to ask for a continuance of facilities to use the coastal route. I may say that I have taken steps to secure informally the advice of Sir John Cadman on the advisability of such negotiations, in view of his intimate knowledge of present conditions in Persia. He definitely recommends such action, and has intimated that the Anglo-Persian Company will give all possible assistance to Imperial Airways, though it cannot actually negotiate on their behalf. I would emphasise, however, that, in the light of the advice tendered by the Foreign Office, I am none too hopeful of the result of these unofficial negotiations, which are likely in any event to drag on for several months.(2) Whatever action may be taken under (1) I consider that we ought forth-with to take all preliminary action for the organisation of the-Arabian coast route a course advocated by our Minister at Tehran and the Foreign Office since July 1930 despite its admitted draw-backs from the political and other aspects. It will take several months to organise, and we simply cannot afford to wait on the results of further negotiations with the Persians, whether official or unofficial. I should add that the Foreign Office incline to the view that signs of activity on our part on the Arabian side may just possibly produce a more accommodating frame of mind in the Persian authorities.Air Ministry, July 23, 1931.(Initialled) A.
