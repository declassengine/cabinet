(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET.CP. 202(31) .Copy No.CABINET,MORAY FIRTH.Note lay the President of the Board of Trade.1. I am in entire agreement with the views on this questionexpressed in the memoranda of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (C.P. 19l(3l)) and of the First Lord of the Admiralty (C.P.185(31)).    I have great sympathy with the Moray Firth fishermen, hut I cannot place their interests in front of the more important interests to which attention is drawn in those two memoranda.I would add that from the point of view of the Mercantile Marine it would he impossible to agree to any proposal which would support in any way the extension of the territorial waters limit beyond three miles.   Nothing but harm could result to one of our greatest industries by anything tending to restrict the area of free and uncontrolled sea. 2. I am not a^are of any sufficient reasons for proposing a revision of the North Sea Fisheries Convention, but I would suggest that the attitude of this country to the Netherlands project of a Conference should be decided by general considerations of fishery policy alone, and that all questions as to the extension of territorial jurisdiction should be expressly excluded from the programme of such a Conference,  if it be decided that one is to be held.Board of Trade,W.G.\
