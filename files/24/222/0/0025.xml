9 Q O *) J uPibOClBOT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS HRI1&amp;NNIC MAJESTYTS (X)VOTMENT).GABIHBT.OOPY NO,     30.P.175 (31)THE YOLuimRY SCHOOL QUESTION. Memorandum by the Presiclent of the Board of Education.1. . Before I became President of the Board the cabinet had decided to carry through the Bill for raising the school age under the Parliament Act and the Prime Minister and I have both made announcements to this effect.    This Bill contains the Scurr Amendment of sghich the broad effect is to put off the operation of the Bill until the Voluntary School difficulty is in some way settled. Under the Parliament Act the Bill must be reintroduced next session, and the Government mil have to state tshat steps it has taken to deal with the Voluntary School problem.    Immediately after the passage of the Scurr Amendment the Prime Minister stated &quot;That the Government will continue its negotiations and we will do our best to overcome the difficulty that has been put in our way by the Amendment which has been carried&quot;.    I therefore gave immediate attention to the question as soon as I was appointed and I an being urgently pressed by a large number of Members of our Party to find some solution.2. During the last few weeks I have, had unofficialconfidential talks with representatives of Local Education Authorities and Teachers, and also with the following representatives of the Churches(a) Church of England - The .Archb5 shops of canterbury and of York.(b) Roman Catholics    - Cardinal Bourne. .
ft I(c) Nonconformists  - Dr. JJ).Jones (Congregation-Nationalists),Mr. M.E.Aubrey (Baptists).Dr. Bobertson (Presbyterians)Dr. Workman and Dr.Scott Lidgei(T7esleyans).t was specially concerned to see a number of representativ Nonconformists, because, in the later stages, it was with them that my predecessor experienced the greatest difficulty.At all idie interviews my avowed purpose was to obtain the views of the representatives as to the present position and as to possible lines of advance. X deliberately refrained from expressing views of my bum.    Before going further I desire to report to my colleagues the position as I find it and to ascertain their views as to the lines of further action.It has to be recognised that the position has not become easier during the last twelve months. Nonconformist opinion has tended to harden as a result of the Catholic attitude at bye-elections and the passage of the Scurr Amendment.   Hie National Union of Teachers are likely to become more critical under the leadership of their new Secretary.    On the other hand, I am satisfied that the situation is far from being unhopeful.    As I will explain more fully below, I think there are ways in which the proposals which were considered at the Conference held by my predecessor last January might be developed and modified in such a way as to secure such a measure of general support as would justify the introduction and passage of a Bill.    Even if the prospects  were less hopeful than I believe, I think it would still be politically essential that we should make a further
endeavour to settle the.question, and that &quot;e should be able to. say that ie had done so.I think in the first place -?e should make it clear that any Concordat tiould be dependent on the passage of the Bill for raising the school age.    Llany members of our oun Party would only support a Concordat Bill on this understanding.    It is an essential condition of support from the National Union of Teachers.There are two changes which might be made to meet Nonconformist views, namely(a) to restrict the making of agreements for thepayment by Local Authorities of capital grants to the present emergency, i.e. to a period of (say) three years from the date of the commencement of the Act;(b) to restrict the extent to rrhich Local authorities might subsequently gi^e further capital aid to a school which has already received one capital grantj so as to prevent any substantial future increases in the number of its pupils. The Archbishop of Canterbury volunteered to me his readiness to accept these changes.    I cannot speak as to the attitude of Roman Catholics.    There is nothing in the changes ihich is antagonistic to their principles. On the other hand, they might regard a compromise so restricted as not good enougja.These changes would probably go far to satisfy a large body of moderate Nonconformist opinion (notably the 7Jesleyans and Presbyterians).    But as a body Nonconformists will hardly be satisfied unless some gesture is made towards meeting the grievance that Headships of all Voluntary Schools are barred to Nonconformists.    The Church of Ergland and the Roman
Catholics would certainly refuse to oonsider any statutory provision under which a grant could only be given to a school on condition that the Headship was thrown open.    On the other hand, they would probably be prepared to accept a provision under tfoich the position of the Head Teacher should be left to be settled by agreement in each case, together with a provision relieving the Managers of any obligation, that they might otherwise have under their Trust Deeds, to insist that the Head Teacher must in every case be a member of their particular denomination.    Provisions such as these would admittedly rarely be operative;   their value would be mainly declaratory, and it is not possible to say how far they would be of value in reconciling Nonconformist opinion.There are various points inherent in the proposals considered by my predecessor^ Conference last January which, in order to prevent misapprehension, it would be well to emphasize in any future discussions:-(a) Grants will be strictly confined to schools already recognised at the date of the passing of the Act.(b) Grants will not be available for &quot;black list&quot; schools as such, although if the Local Authority needs the school for purposes of reorganisation, or for raising the school age, it can be the subject of a grant/(c) In accordance with the concession offered at the Conference by the Church of England, provision shall be made for undencminational religious teaching wherever there is no effective choice of school.    Nonconformists rightly attach
great importance to this concession as mitigating the single school area grievance.    The Roman Catholics are inclined to be hostile to it, but its effect on their schools is so negligible that I think their opposition would hardly be maintained. As regards future action I propose:-(a) Now and immediately after the holidays to hold discussions with representatives of the various interests separately, and perhaps also concurrently. I should place before these conferences my personal suggestions (as indicated above) as to the lines of a possible solution.-   (b) If the results of these discussions warrant it, I should propose to ask my colleagues to authorise the introduction of a Bill, and then to allow an early opportunity for its subsequent stages.(c)   In accordance with the Cabinet decision (Cab.14(31) Conclusion 11) already announced, it will -be necessary to find time during next Session for the repassing of the School Attendance Bill under the Parliament Act.     I should, however, not desire thus to reintroduce the Bill until the prospects of any Concordat Bill are ascertainable.Last Uinter the Cabinet appointed the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Health, and the First (a\.v,ussionor of Works to be a Sub-Committee to oo-operate with my predecessor in dealing with this problem,     X should desire to keep in close contact with (hum in the course of any fur tier steps which I may take to deal with this mat-cor.H.B.L-S.14th July, 1931.
