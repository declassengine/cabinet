This paper attempts to explain briefly how Germany, notwithstanding her difficult exchange position and her shortage of raw materials, is able not only to rearm but to provide a surplus of armaments for export, from which she derives economic and financial advantages.[17159] b
Profit derived from Exports.3. It is commonly realised that Germany gains considerable political advantage through her ability to export armaments, especially to countries unable to manufacture for themselves. It is less commonly realised that the actual trans-action profits Germany financially, even if prices are cut to a level enabling her to compete successfully against her competitors, in that the countervalue, whether in exchange or in kind, obtained for the finished armament store exported may be many times the cost of that part of its raw material content which Germany had to import in the first place.4. That German export prices for armaments are low is due not to any direct State subsidy, but first and foremost to production on an immense scale. Moreover, Germany regards the export trade in armaments as one of her most important commercial as well as political assets, and gives special facilities and encouragement to manufacturers and dealers accordingly. She has derived full benefit from establishing herself in an expanding market, and has been prepared to force an entry into that market even at some initial loss; realising that in the case of armaments, more perhaps than of any other commodity, a type once adopted by a foreign Power almost certainly ensures repeat orders.5. Countries with whom Germany has had clearing agreements and with whom, by means of heavy purchases at attractive prices, she soon built up a credit balance in blocked marks, have been easily persuaded to accept armaments and -square the account. In this manner certain countries have virtually had German armaments forced upon them and have been brought further and further into the German orbit. There is no doubt that this has formed part of a deliberate commercial as well as a political policy. Armaments are regarded by Germany as merchandise which she has special facilities for manufacturing cheaply. She has also conjectured apparently rightly that in present-day Weltpolitik the successful dealer in arms can frequently uncover markets for other goods, while, conversely, a foreign contract for the erection of industrial plant frequently leads to a contract for the supply of arms.6. Germany derives other profit from exporting armaments, such as improvement in manufacturing technique, the disposal of obsolescent types at a profit, and the consequent aid to the re-equipment of her own forces with improved patterns, but in the main her export trade in armaments is due to (a) A decision to exploit her ability to export armaments as part of a general political policy;(6) The fact that in the long run, if not in respect of every transaction, the export is commercially profitable to her.7. The above conclusion is only a partial answer to the question propounded, and by itself begs the question: Hoav has Germany managed to create her prodigious manufacturing capacity ?The following paragraphs attempt to provide a brief answer to this further question. To do so demands an excursion into past history. It is misleading to suppose that Germany&apos;s rearmament effort began in 1933. True, deliveries of armaments in quantity began in October of that year, following upon a decision, taken soon after Herr Hitler&apos;s return to power in the. previous February. But no such output as was then or is now being realised would have been possible had not extensive plans for the mobilisation of Industry been already in existence when the order to re-arm was given. .2. It must first of all be emphasised that German exports of armaments, considerable though they may appear in comparison with those of other countries, are very small in relation to the total quantity of armaments Germany now manu-factures annually. Though the value of German exports of armaments of all kinds in 1937 may be^estimated at about  18 million, the value qf the armaments manufactured has been estimated at between  400 million and  500 million. In fact, the first cause of Germany.&apos;s ability to export is her ability to manufacture at a rate never before achieved by any country in peace time. Therefore, in order to show how Germany is able to export armaments as she does, it is necessary to explain how she has been able to achieve her immense output. Before attempting to do this, however, it may be well to correct a frequent misconception regarding the effect of armament exports on Germany&apos;s profit and loss account.
The Creation of German Capacity to Manufacture A armaments.A. Preparation.8. Between 1920 and 1933, at first secretly, though less so after the departure of the Interallied Military Control Commission, the mobilisation of German Industry for the production of armaments was being planned. The plans were more than once redrafted and, curiously enough, met with considerable opposition from the Fighting Forces, until the iatter came fully to realise the part that Industry and Economics must play in a modern war of national effort. Circumstances made it impossible for these plans to be tested extensively by educational orders. Nevertheless, the plans were ready when the time came and the rapidity of German rearmament has proved their value.9. In this work Industry co-operated with the Ministry of Defence, the latter laying down, the quantity of armaments of each type required, the former making hypothetical arrangements for their manufacture. Industry was, at least, an equal partner in the business a necessary situation which was probably the cause of early opposition from the Fighting Forces.10. Collaboration between these two interests would have been impossible had not German Industry already begun to form itself into an organised entity, first under the Reichsverband der Deutschen Industrie, later renamed the Reichsstand der Deutschen Industrie (thereby acknowledging the part Industry* was held to play as an &quot; estate of the realm &quot;), and now, since 1934, incorporated in the Ministry of Economics.11. Although the work of the R.V.D.I. was done before the advent of the Authoritarian State, it could not have done its work had it not acquired some measure of authority over German Industry. In point of fact this authority was very great, being derived from the composition of its Executive Committee, the members of which, corporately, were able directly or indirectly to exert executive control over the greater part of German Industry.12. It is not for a moment suggested that the necessary collaboration between the staffs of the Fighting Forces and Industry was achieved or main-tained easily, or without friction. Such friction presented less difficulty in the planning period than it did when the call for action came; but by then the Authoritarian regime with its far greater powers of coercion had supervened. However, the clues to German success in planning her rearmament programme before attempting to undertake it in practice and thereby laying a sound foundation upon which to build, and without which the present structure could not have been erected, are undoubtedly that:  (a) A group of German industrialists succeeded in rebuilding, rationalisingand organising German Industry into a corporate body.(b) Collaboration was effected on a sound basis between a single departmentof the Ministry of Defence, representing the co-ordinated interests of the Fighting Forces on the one hand and, on the other, a body capable of representing and controlling an incorporated national Industry, the two interests being supported by an undeviating long-term policy.B. Action.13. However much rearmament may have been assisted by the years spent in study, research and planning, there is no doubt that Germany has been faced with immense difficulties in the practical application of the plan. In the circumstances in which plans were drawn up on paper by the R.V.D.I. and the Reichswehr-ministerium (now the Reichskriegsministerium) there is little doubt that the plans must have included a careful study of the labour, raw materials and financial difficulties involved. Nevertheless, it- has been the almost unlimited power and authority subsequently acquired by the State which has been chiefly responsible for rapidly providing a practical answer to these later problems.* It will doubtless be-borne in mind that the term &quot; armament industry &quot; has only a specialised meaning. Under, modern conditions the whole national Industry-of an industrial country is necessary for the manufacture of armaments. ^[17159] &apos;&quot;&apos; - . -&quot; jb 2
Skilled Labour.14. No amount of Authoritarianism can reduce the hours necessary to teach the average man a skilled job, but it can, as in Germany, reduce the time-lag by abolishing trade union restrictions upon the number of hours of work per day. It can force men to take service in new districts, compel a firm to train a quota of apprentices based on the total number of hands employed,&apos; shift skilled labour from surfeited trades to others, raise men and boys.to skilled rates of pay on passing a State-controlled examination, irrespective of age, seniority or experience, and, so long as the people are ready to endure it, organise, dragoon and generally act in an arbitrary manner unbound by precedent, law or custom.15. Coercion of labour by the State has been reinforced by remarkable progress in the technique of armament manufacture. With State encouragement new manufacturing processes have been devised to suit quantity production methods; new machine tools have been designed to reduce the essential proportion of skilled labour; men have been rapidly taught to perform a single skilled opera-tion and then granted skilled men&apos;s pay, and so on. If it be possible to sum up briefly this phase of activity, it may perhaps be described as the apotheosis of modern quantity production methods encouraged by a demand for armaments previously unparalleled in peace. This huge demand followed from the policy adopted at the outset of aiming at ultimately putting into the field nothing less than the maximum Forces which the population, economy and industry of the nation can sustain.Design and Standardisation.16. A further factor assisting rapid mass production and helping also to solve the labour problem lies in the German approach to standardisation of design and manufacturing processes. Before 1933 Germany had realised the necessity of designing new types of weapons capable of being rapidly produced in quantity by Industry, and had taken action accordingly. Moreover, a design, or for that matter, a manufacturing process, perfected by one firm, once it has been accepted by the State, now becomes State property, and all other firms scheduled to produce the armament store in question are compelled to reproduce the design, and, if desirable, adopt the manufacturing process. Firms are encouraged to improve designs and processes, but no improvement is accepted by the Government unless it shows a marked advance upon the previous standard, either from a military or from a manufacturing point of view. Before accepting a new standard, the Ministry of Defence, which in respect of the provision of materiel operates through a single department on behalf of all the Armed Forces,* is careful to obtain and give as much weight to the opinions of civilian manufacturers from the point of view of manufacture as to those of the Fighting Staffs from the point of view of the efficiency of the weapon.Raw Materials.17. The explanation of how Germany has so far solved her raw material problem cannot be separated entirely from finance, but to begin with it must be pointed out that sufficient raw materials have always been-forthcoming to meet all the demands of the current programme for armament manufacture, the latter never yet having been suspended or seriously checked through a shortage of raw materials.   This has been achieved by (a) The strict rationing on wartime principles of the supply of raw materials to all consumers, and the prevention of waste in the armament industry as much as elsewhere.(b) The sacrifice of the home market for consumption goods and even of theexport market, in so far as has been considered compatible with safety.(c) The careful collection of waste and scrap by methods and to an extentcomparable only with similar activity in time of war. id) The intensive development of domestic resources of raw materials and of substitutes from other indigenous raw materials. (e) The control of foreign credits and their utilisation in the best interestsof the import requirements of the rearmament plan.* The Head of this Department, composed of Service officers and technical experts, with subordinate representative staffs in each Command Area, has direct access to the Minister of ]Oefence. His duties are co-ordination and liaison; to obtain rapid co-ordinated decisions from the staff of the Fighting Forces on the one hand and Industry on the other.
18. In this process, foodstuffs are regarded as raw materials and are controlled accordingly. Germany has, however, shown herself willing to face the resultant reduction in the standard of living in order that industrial output may he increased. The measures taken and the means adopted to this end are those normally associated with a state of war, although the resultant discomforts suffered by the German people can be alleviated by imports when it becomes essential to maintain the national morale, since an actual state of economic warfare does not exist. None of these measures could have been applied, .at least to the existing extent, without the rigid, centralised, governmental control of everything which forms the foundation of the Totalitarian State, nor could they continue to be applied without the broad general consent of the nation;19. Nevertheless, the continual complaints heard from Germany of a shortage of raw materials, which is genuine at least in so far as concerns their availability for the consumption goods industry, have succeeded, as doubtless they are intended to do, in giving rise to misconceptions regarding the true position. If figures for the period of highest industrial activity in post-war pre-rearmament Germany (1927-29) be compared with those for 1937, taking into account industrial production, imports, exports and the increase in domestic production of raw materials, it is clear that any shortage of raw materials resulting in the lowering of the standard of national life and comfort is solely due to the colossal rearmament programmed Field-Marshal Gcering&apos;s now famous alternative of cannon or butter exactly describes the position.20. Finally, therefore, the solution of the German raw material problem, disregarding for the moment the methods employed to finance that solution, has depended upon : (a) The psychology of the German nation, as it is by nature and as it wasmodified by post-war experiences under treatment from propaganda suited to it.(b) The adoption of economic measures&quot; hitherto regarded as appertainingonly to a state of war.(c) The institution of an absolute centralised governmental control of every-thing according to the principles of the Totalitarian State.Finance.21. It is not within the scope of this paper to enter into the technical devices and stratagems resorted to by Germany in order to finance her policy. Suffice to say that they could hardly have been put into operation in time of peace without State control of foreign trade, foreign exchange, foreign credits and the money market. By this means Germany has divided her financial problem into two parts, dealing with each separately and by different methods.22. Externally Germany has paid her way,t first by appropriating to the State in exchange for currency, at an arbitrarily fixed rate of exchange, that part of the wealth of the nation which had or could be made to have a value outside the Reich, thereafter restricting imports involving an outflow of exchange to balance the,counter-value which could be made available at the moment to pay for them. This course of action has been facilitated by the conclusion of Clearing, Payment and Barter Agreements with various countries. Nevertheless, she has been forced steadily to reduce her reserve of gold and foreign credit to the size of a small nest-egg, retained against the danger of loss of national morale in the -event of a bad harvest.23. The risk Germany runs is lest her foreign purchasing power should dwindle below the minimum essential to meet the requirements of her programme, the keystone of which is increased industrial production assisted by large State orders for armaments.  Hence the widespread propaganda to build up the idea that. * Industrial production in 1937 was 15 per cent, higher than in 1929. The total weight of Taw materials imported in 1937 was 50-43 million tons against 55-77 million tons in 1929, but domestic production of raw materials in 1937 greatly exceeded that of 1929, while the total weight &apos;0f exports in 1937 was only 66-60 million tons against 82-90 million tons in 1929.t It must, nevertheless, be remembered that Germany borrowed from abroad between 1920 and 1933 very large sums which have not been repaid, and with this money re-equipped and a-ejuvenated her Industry.
Germany is unfairly prevented from obtaining the foreign exchange she requires by being excluded from markets and sources of cheap raw materials, by the denial , to her of colonies, and so on.24. Internally, the core of the financial problem is, how to maintain the con-fidence of the nation while expending on her Armed Forces an ever-increasing sum which, according to the most recent estimates of the Financial Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Berlin, has amounted to a direct expenditure of Rm. 36^ milliard in the five years 1933 to 1937, with a total of about Rm. 45 milliard collected as revenue in the same period.*25. So far the answer to the purely financial aspect of the problem has been found in borrowing, which is estimated to have increased by no less than Rm. 27 milliard in the five years. It has not been difficult to consolidate a portion of this sum, there being little else into which a German investor can put his money, but the unpublished, unconsolidated portion is estimated at over Rm. 17 milliard, without counting interest or guarantees.f26. So long as Germany can meet her foreign exchange obligations and can. continue to import what is necessary to maintain the minimum essential standard of living and carry on her policy, this fact alone may suffice to secure the con-fidence of the nation. The real risk run by the Government is that some incalculable internal or external event may occur to shake that confidence. It is largely a psychological problem, but the National Socialists know the psychology of their countrymen and have taken unprecedented steps to transmute it into Nazi psychology, the essence of which is Gleichschaltung.27. If it be argued that, apart from psychological issues, mere unsoundness of the internal financial position must cause a crash, the view of the Financial Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy, Berlin, may be quoted in reply : &quot; For four years Germany has kept down wages and consumption, pre-vented the outflow of capital, and employed the labour which was surplus in 1932 to a minor extent to make export and consumption goods, and to a major extent to make arms, armament factories, roads, public buildings, &amp;c. At the same time she has managed to feed, clothe, house, and^even amuse, the workmen. Even if it is argued that this cannot go on because it has to some extent involved using up economic reserves, the answer is first that the economic reserves of a country like Germany are vastly greater than used to be supposed, and, secondly, that no very great adjustment should be required to revert to a state in which a sufficiently high proportion of the country&apos;s energy is applied to creating economic values so.as to enable reserves to be built up again. No doubt many difficult problems would have to be solved, en route, but the enormous energy, adaptability and discipline of the German people would not be found wanting.&quot;Conclusions.28. Any attempt to draw concise conclusions from this paper may be mis-leading since danger lies in over-simplifying the reply to any question as complicated as that which this paper has set out to answer. The more so in that rearmament in the unprecedented fashion described remains the focal point of the Nazi political and economic programme. By most Governments any pro-gramme of rearmament is usually regarded as a regrettable necessity and a.futile form of capital expenditure, but to Herr Hitler, faced with the urgent necessity of dealing with the problem of 6 million unemployed, a rearmament programme combined economic with political advantages, and was deliberately used by him as an instrument of national economic revival.29. Moreover, there are many facets of the problems facing Germany which have not been touched upon in this paper, while the policy itself and the methods; adopted are accompanied by serious risks and disadvantages, many of which* According to the same source, direct expenditure on defence in 1937 may be estimated&apos;at Rm. 13 milliard, with a revenue of Em. 13-8 milliard.I It is estimated that the total published and unpublished debt, including the foreign debt, but not including guarantees, will amount to Rm. 30 milliard on the 31st March, 1938.
already have been made clear. Nevertheless, if the above be borne in mind it may be concluded that the outstanding features of the action taken by Germany to rearm are : (a) German Industry was rationalised, re-equipped with the most modern plant and machinery, and organised into a corporate bd*dy with an executive council capable of acting as spokesmen for&apos;Industry as a whole and of exercising control over it when necessary.(&amp;) This incorporated national Industry, in collaboration with a single Ministry of Defence, capable of representing the co-ordinated views of the Fighting Services, planned for the mobilisation of Industry for rearmament over a period of years before the actual quantity pro-duction of armaments was required.30. The above action, taken before the advent of the Authoritarian regime, could not have succeeded&apos; had not the participants in the scheme acquired a con-siderable measure of authority. The credit of later success is due largely to the methods and organisation of the Totalitarian State, which, however, could not have acted with anything like the rapidity achieved had not industrial mobilisa-tion of the country been carefully planned beforehand.31. Finally, it has been shown that German ability to export armaments is entirely dependent on her acquired ability to manufacture them by mass pro-duction in unprecedented quantities. What will happen when, from one cause or another, the demand for armaments falls, remains to be seen. At the present rate, unless war supervenes, the German internal market must in a few years become glutted. True, Germany is already taking steps to try to capture the world export trade in armaments, but the total value of this can hardly equal that of the present German output, which by the end of 1937 was at a rate sufficient to arm and equip in the most modern fashion about 15 Divisions of the Army, and to deliver about 500 aircraft per month, while carrying out according to plan a considerable programme of naval construction.
ENCLOSURE NO.   2. THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT5Copy of a Letter from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.(No. C 1801/G)My dear Tom, Foreign Office, April 27, 1938.YOU have, no doubt, seen a paper prepared, at the request of the Foreign Office, by the Industrial Intelligence Centre on the subject of Germany&apos;s exports of armaments. It has been circulated as F.C.I. 117* and it seems to me so important that I have asked for it to be submitted to the C.I.D.The paper, as its name suggests, was intended in the first place to explain, for our benefit, how it is that Germany, without the resources we possess and, while engaged on a programme of rearmament hitherto greatly in excess of our own, can apparently at the same time export armaments, for sale in the open market and to Spain, in quantities surpassing anything we are able to accomplish even when the markets open to us include the Dominions, which in certain cases are pressing us for urgent delivery.This is a matter of serious concern to us, for the inability to export arms in adequate quantities to friendly and potentially friendly countries involves, to my mind, a very real risk that those countries will either be drawn both commercially and politically into the German orbit, or,, if they are not, will prove to be inadequately armed at a time when well-equipped allies may be essential to our own safety. In saying this I do not, of course, belittle the efforts now being made to meet the requirements of Portugal and Turkey, in so far as it is within our power to do so; still less do I suggest any modification of our present policy of looking to our own safety first, though I am not sure that the time has not come when we ought to consider once more the extensions of the Export Credits Guarantee Departments activities to export of arms. Indeed, if it were only a question of arms exports, I should probably not feel impelled, as I do, to write this letter.What does cause me very real disquiet is the light which the paper to which I have referred throws upon the formidable efficiency of the German organisation for the manufacture of arms, and the contrast, at present, between German output and our own. It is a contrast which renders the satisfactory conduct of foreign affairs a matter of extreme difficulty; for our political influence is now, and is likely to remain, largely dependent upon the relation between our armed strength and Germany&apos;s. Indeed, our relations with Germany herself are dependent upon the same factor, for I fear that we can never hope to establish stable and friendly relations with Germany unless we are at least as strong as she is. The fact that we are rearming at a (for us) unprecedented speed is, of course, some sort of reassurance to the world; but the world asks itself (and I confess,to sharing its doubts) whether the speed of our rearmament, however great the eventual strength aimed at, is in fact sufficient to ensure our safety when we are confronted with the German system of production based on the mobilisation of industry and finance described in the F.C.I. memorandum..Although the actual methods of armament production are outside my sphere, the problem is, as I have shown, one which closely concerns and, indeed, con-ditions-the foreign policy for which I am responsible: I need only instance the Chiefs of Staff recent report on the military implications of German aggression against Czechoslovakia. The purpose of this letter is, therefore, to suggest that, if there is any doubt as to whether by the end of 1939 our strength in armaments is going to be satisfactory in relation to that of Germany, then our system of rearmament might be looked at again in the light of what we know about German methods.It is, of course, clear that we cannot imitate the German system in its entirety. Not only are we obliged in the nature of things to dispense with the long period of preparatory planning described in paragraph 7 of the paper to which I have referred, but we are also precluded from the complete regimentation of finance,* Printed as an Enclosure to C.I.D. Paper No. 1426-B.[17212]    ,
industry and labour upon which the German system is based. Nevertheless, it seems to me, as a layman, that there are certain factors in the German system which, subject to appropriate modifications, we might well be able to adopt in so far as we hav* not already done so or begun to do so. I am thinking particularly of the measures described in paragraphs 9, 10, 11, 12 and 16 of the F.C.I. paper. Whether it is, in fact, possible for.us to take, any of these steps, is, of course, hardly for me to say; my interest in the matter is, as I. have indicated, only to ensure that, in an international situation where force is once again the deciding factor, our own strength should not be inferior to that of the most powerful of our potential enemies.(Signed)      HALIFAX.

Paper No. 1426-B.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum prepared by the Department of Overseas Trade (Industrial Intelligence Centre) on the Export of Armaments from Germany (Enclosure to Annex to C.I.D. Paper No. 1426-B).Mr. MORTON, introducing the Memorandum, said that there were two additional points which might be thought worthy of note. Firstly, the German potentiality for affording long-term credits to importing countries for example, 7 years in the case of Afghanistan and 5 years in the case of Bulgaria and Greece. Secondly, it was becoming increasingly clear that the Germans paid much more attention to the quantitative than to the qualitative aspect. They clearly held the view that large numbers would always defeat smaller numbers despite any technical superiority of the latter.Mr. HORE-BELISHA suggested, and THE COMMITTEE agreed, that the Paper should be forwarded to the Cabinet.  It was an impressive and illuminating x document which gave an answer to the oft repeated question of how Germany managed to do all that she does without going bankrupt.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART suggested, and THE COMMITTEE agreed, that a letter* dated the 27th April, from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence on the same subject, should also be remitted to the Cabinet at the same time.Mr. MORTON informed the Committee that Great Britain&apos;s exports of armaments for 1937 amounted to  8-2 million, compared with the figure of  18 million for Germany, the figures for the export of warships being omitted in each case. Referring to paragraph 31 of the Memorandum, he said that the German output, which was stated to be at a rate sufficient to arm and equip about 15 divisions, was the annual output.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed That the Memorandum on German exports of Armaments prepared by the Industrial Intelligence Centre (Department of Overseas Trade) (C.I.D.
