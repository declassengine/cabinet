CABINET. \THE REGULATION OP WAGES AND CONDITIONS OP EMPLOYMENT IN&quot; &quot;oiiB&quot; TRANSPORT OP GOODS BY-ROAD.&quot;&quot;Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.     As my colleagues v/ill recollect, a Bill to regulate wages and conditions in the transport of goods by road was promised in the King&apos; s Speech at the opening of the Session.     On 2nd December, 1937, I circulated a memorandum (CP. 293/37) on the subject, together with a summary of the principal recommendations of the Baillie Committee.     In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet (Cab. Conclusions 46/37) 1 have been preparing the necessary Bill in conjunction with the Minister of Transport and I circulate a copy herewith together with a summary of its provisions.2*     Discussions have taken place with the National Joint Conciliation Boards for the Road Transport Industry in England and Wales and in Scotland, and, as regards C licences in particular, with representatives of employers in ten important industries, and with the Confederation of Employers Organisations   .;-and the Trades Union Congress..     The objection felt by organised trades to the Baillie Committee&apos;s proposals., as regards C licences has been met by a modifica-tion under which complaints as to non-payment of fair wages in industries with effective voluntary machinery for settling such disputes will be referred to such machinery.     The Conciliation Boards have no objection to this modification but would like to strengthen the Baillie proposals as regards unorganised employers by requiring them, if they are not paying rates settled by some appropriate trade union agreement, to pay the rates fixed for A and B licence holders;    this desire is not met in the Bill but they will not press it to the point of prejudicing the Bill though they may move amendments on the point in Committee.3.     Another matter which caused some difficulty was the desire of the majority of the Scottish organisations to have an entirely separate Board for A and B licence holders in Scotland.     A compromise lias been reached under which there will be one Area Board for Scotland covering the two Traffic Areas and this Area Board will have the right to initiate proposalsj a right not possessed by other Area Boards.
4.     Subject to the above modifications the Bill is based generally on therecommendations contained in the Baillie Committee Report (Cmd. 5140).Any industry in which the wages of transport workers concerned are or willbe fixed by statute, e.g. Trade Boards, will automatically be outside the &apos;it &apos;scope of the Bill.     Railway workers whose wages are determined byagreement between the companies and the railway trade unions are also outside its scope.     With regard to the classes covered by the Bill, it is proposed to include, in addition to drivers and statutory attendants, workers, such as vanboys and &quot;mates&quot;, who travel on the vehicle in connection with the carriage of goods.     As regards conditions of employ-ment, the power of regulation is confined to those which ordinarily form part of wage-fixing machinery (e.g. over-time rates, waiting time, etc.) and to holidays with pay.5.     The discussions have emphasised the necessity for immediate legislation and have made it clear that it is essential to deal with C licensees as well as and at the same time as A and B licensees.     Moreover, the recent threatened stoppage in the industry indicates the danger of delay.     I accordingly ask for authority to introduce the Bill before the Easter recess, subject to reference to the Home Affairs Committee and subject to any minor or drafting amendments that may be necessary.(Intd. )   S.

Also, the Industrial Court is required in fixing the statutory remuneration to define the employment in respect of which the remuneration is fixed.The decisions of the Industrial Court are to remain in force for a period of three years in the case of all workers employed by the. employer concerned on the work to which the decision applies, the employer and the worker concerned or his trade union having a right to apply for a review of the decision at intervals of not less than three months.     The Court is given power to make the decision retrospective for a period not exceeding six months.It is also provided that in any proceedings on a reference to the Industrial Court, a right of attendance shall be given to any organisation of employers or trade union which, by reason of their membership, appear to the Court to be interested in the question referred.
GENERAL.Duty to pay Statutory Remuneration and remedies for default.Clause 6.This clause makes it an offence to pay remuneration at less than the^statutory remuneration and provides for the imposition on summary conviction of a fine not exceeding twenty pounds and the payment of arrears of remuneration &quot;by the employer for a period not exceeding two years.
