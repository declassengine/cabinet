4   -SECRET.I.-INTRODUCTION. The Progress of Provincial Autonomy.1. At the end, of . January Ministries had been in power in four Provinces (Assam, Bengal, Punjab, and Sind) for ten months ; in six others Congress Ministries had been in power for over six months; and in one (North-West Frontier Province; for five months. It is now possible-to give some estimate of the working of Provincial Autonomy.In the four Provinces which are being administered by non-Congress Govern-ments no great change from the conditions of the old regime is visible. In Assam a strong Congress opposition has occasionally forced the Ministry to a line of action which they would not otherwise have adopted ; the Bengal Government, which is particularly obnoxious to Congress, has given no important concessions except in the release of detenus which was arranged only with the consent of the Governor ; the Punjab Government is still held up by Congress as an example of a reactionary force calculated to hamper the aspirations of those who are fighting for independence ; and little is heard of Sind. In these Provinces the Ministries have inherited pre-autonomy methods, noticeably in regard to the maintenance of law and order, which they still employ to good effect. Relations between the Governors, the Ministers, and the officers of the services are satisfactory, and there is no cause for anxiety that any Ministry is likely to make a step so false that it will lead to disaster. At the same time, and though (except in Assam) these Ministries seem firm in the saddle, &quot; responsibility &quot; has produced some weakening of authority. It is not&quot;only that the Opposition, even where as in the Punjab-it is numerically weak, can by clamour influence the Ministry&apos;s action ; the necessity of obliging the supporters also is apt to be a source of indecision.In the Congress Provinces there can be no doubt that experience of power has increased the love of it and diminished the likelihood of Congress returning to the wilderness of non-co-operation. Even Jawaharlal Nehru, who was at first an uncompromising opponent of office acceptance by Congress, claimed in November that the step had everywhere &quot; strengthened the freedom movement in India &quot; an equivocal phrase which is at any rate evidence of acquiescence. In those Congress Provinces where a sane right-wing element predominates it may be said that Ministries, in spite of having introduced several measures of doubtful wisdom, have, on the whole, acquitted themselves well. That a Congress Ministry can show genuine strength in action appears from the example of Madras, where Rajagopala-charities, the Premier, shows himself as little susceptible to public criticism as any bureaucrat.The necessity for leaving the ultimate decision on certain subjects in the hands of Governors has been amply justified ; Ministries have for the most part avoided a clash with the Governors&apos; authority. Where the Ministry is controlled by, or dependent on, left-wing support, the situation is less reassuring, and Governors have been called upon to bear a heavy strain of responsibilit37; they have on occasions had to decide whether an assertion of authority was so imperatively required as to face the risk of resignation of the Ministry and the consequent - suspension of the Constitution, with the added knowledge that a crisis in one Province might easily mean the resignation of all the Congress Ministries and an upheaval over the greater part of British India. It is perhaps doubtful whether in any conflict arising up to the end of January the Congress High Command would have permitted a Ministry to resign ; but the risk has more than once been substantial. The attitude of Congress towards law and order and violent speaking has so far provided the most dangerous possibility of a constitutional collapse, but the great influence of Gandhi has been thrown into the scale of order. His precarious state of health during the past three months has been the cause of anxiety, giving rise to speculations about the future policy of the Congress Party if he ceased to exercise his still supreme control over the Working Committee. There is reason to surmise that as soon as Gandhi goes the difference1 of opinion between the right and left wings will widen into an irreconcilable breach.Inside the Ministries, the stature of Rajagopalachari (Madras) has grown and that of Pant (United Provinces) has diminished. In most of the Provinces it can be said that, at any rate for the Premiers and their more active colleagues, the task of administration has proved onerous. The physical and mental strain has been great for men, some of whom are not in perfect training and some of whom are not
5171accustomed to live excessively laborious days. In the Congress Provinces acceptance of office has for some Ministers meant a considerable sacrifice of income. That in spite of the fatigue and penalties of an administrative career the Congress Premiers have become more tenacious of office is a hopeful sign./*- II.-CONGRESS PROVINCES.(a) Ministries : Stability and Reputation.2. Bihar. The Premier, Sri Krishna Sinha, has shown himself to be a man of no personality and little courage, and the general opinion of the Ministry is poor. Although internal dissension is not marked, it is said that Dr. Mahmud, the Education Minister, does not get on well with Sinha, and that Jaglal Chaudhuri, who represents the depressed classes, is frequently left out in the cold. It is recog-nised that a Ministry of four cannot cope with the work, but no addition can be made until a suitable Muslim is found and at present there appears to be none. In the Legislature the Ministry can be sure of only about 35 of their followers, though the strength of the Congress Party is over 90. The main anxiety of the Ministry is the strength of the Kisan (agrarian) movement in this Province.3. Bombay. The Ministry have earned a reputation for pursuing moderate courses, and their prestige is high among all classes; the Premier (Kher) is respected and the team is a fairly happy one. Desai, the Revenue Minister, remains unreasonable and requires firm control, but the Finance Minister (Latthe) has fortunately proved sound and balanced. The Home Minister (Munshi) has shown courage and common sense in matters of law and order; but though he goes in fear of Communist activities, recent events suggest that he accepts their declarations oil good faith with unjustifiable optimism. Though the initial excitement of holding-office has given place to a realisation of the burden of work which it means, the Ministry appear to be keen on retaining their position. Recently Kher, the Premier, has shown signs of being overworked ; he has little time to study his colleagues&apos; problems and consequently has less control over them than could be desired.4. Central Provinces.-Although individual Ministers are not devoid of talent, internal dissension in the Cabinet is so rife that the position of the Premier is threatened and the Ministry are not pulling their weight. In November Misra, who is in charge of local self-government, had a difference of opinion with the Premier, Khare, over the publication of a scheme for reforming local- bodies; piqued, apparently, by the general disapproval with which nearly every responsible person from the Governor downwards greeted his scheme, Misra started conspiring against his leader, and eventually combined with Shukla, Minister for Education^ in opposition to the Premier. Khare&apos;s position has been weakened by this&apos; alliance, and he can put little faith in Sharif, Law Minister, who is generally considered unreliable, or in Gole, the Revenue Minister. In recent elections to the Ail-India Congress Committee Khare succeeded in getting a place with difficulty ; his position is shaky, but it is likely that wider considerations of Congress Party policy will prevent the danger of creating a definite breach by overthrowing Khare. Individually he is shaping well and if he has to go the Province will suffer.5. Madras. There is little to be said of any of the Ministers individually except Rajagopalachari, the Premier, whose outstanding personality rules and guides his colleagues to such an extent that he is said to do most of their work in addition to his own, without arousing dissatisfaction or dissension in the Cabinet. The Premier is a man of courage and determination, and his pioneer work in putting into practice his conception of the Congress ideals has to some extent set the pace in other Congress Provinces. Where convinced of the Tightness of his measures he has shown himself prepared to carry them through in spite of considerable opposition. In November the Ministry earned a good deal of unpopularity by their &quot; repressive &quot; prosecution of a seditionist; Rajagopalachari, backed by Gandhi, confounded his critics and got his action endorsed by an overwhelming majority in the Madras Legislative Congress Party. Certain proposed legislation and the orders for cuts in salaries have not added to the Ministry&apos;s popularity, yet their position is as strong as ever.6. North-West Frontier. The Ministry has made the most of its opportunities to consolidate its position.   The Congress Party strength in the Legislature when 7143 B
Congress took office was little more than that of the Opposition, who were for some time optimistic of turning the Ministry out. The death of Sir Abdul Qaiyum, the leader of the Opposition, was a blow to their hopes, and from that time the Opposition has declined until it is now an ineffective body able to rely on only about ten votes. Attempts have been made by certain Muslim organisations to form a real opposition, but they have petered out. Khan Sahib, the Premier, is conspicuous for his friendliness to British officers ; he is sound but not spectacular. He has been accused of pro-Hindu feeling and is not popular in the capital; Bhanju Ram, Finance Minister, is said to resent the fact that his colleagues sometimes ignore him, but internal dissension is not noticeable.7. Orissa. The Ministry, composed of three Congressmen with right-wing sympathies, is steady and fairly stable. Kanungo, the Revenue Minister, is recognised to be the ablest, but all the Ministers are held in good esteem by the public. There is said to be some jealousy of the Premier, Biswanath Das, who belongs to one of the districts which were separated from Madras Presidency when the new Province of Orissa was formed, so that the native Oriyas are inclined to resent the stranger&apos;s intrusion ; but this has so far given no cause for anxiety or trouble.8. United Provinces. The Ministry is an unimpressive body, leaning towards the left wing, on whose support it is largely dependent. Individual Ministers count for little except Pandit Pant, the Premier, who carries nearly the whole weight on his own shoulders and naturally finds the burden a heavy one ; he has shown littJe strength of character, being anxious to avoid giving offence and yet able to satisfy no one. He feels his position to be insecure, especially as Nehru disapproves of him, but the support of the majority of the Working Committee has persuaded him to remain. He has had to contend with many difficulties, largely due to his own vacillations, and cannot always be depended upon to face the facts and take firm action when it is required ; his inclination is to gain his ends by persuasion rather than by use of the powers provided by law. Pyare Lai Sharma, the Education Minister, is an oldish man who has never settled down happily in his job, and is likely to resign soon. The only woman Minister in the country (Mrs. Pandit, sister of Jawaharlal Nehru) has made a good impression.(bj Ministries&apos; Programmes.9. Bihar. The Ministry spent November and December conducting prolonged discussions on various Bdls intended for the Legislature, including a Tenancy Bill, a Bill to control sugar factories, and an Agricultural Income-Tax Bill. In January they were said to be contemplating the separation of the judicial and executive functions of magistrates a vexed question which has not yet come to the forefront, though periodical agitation for it is conducted in the Press. They also had under consideration a comprehensive scheme of rural development, and proposals for the introduction of &quot; prohibition &quot; in industrial areas at an estimated costof 6 lakhs of rupees ; they were engaged in rushing through the framing of the Sugar Factories Control Bill with almost indecent haste. If the Ministry succeed in putting into practice all the measures which they are contemplating, one result will be the necessity for an army of additional Government officials to cope with the extra work.10. Bombay. Late in November the Ministry decided to abolish the system of Honorary Magistrates throughout the Presidency except in Bombay city itself with effect from 1st January. This system has served two purposes in India : it has created a staff of unpaid magistrates to cope for the most part with a mass of petty litigation, and it has been used as a method of rewarding loyalty or meritorious service, as the recipient of an Honorary Magistracy invariably considers the honour well worth the trouble of the little work he has to do. On the other hand the system has been abused to some extent: Honorary Magistrates&apos; courts are generally somewhat inefficient, and they are not always free from corruption. Congress is also opposed to the award of titles or honours of any sort. The Bombay Governments decision was therefore welcomed in many quarters. In December the Ministry were framing their budget proposals but had some difficulty in deciding on their policy. They began to formulate hesitant proposals for cuts in salaries, but were waiting for the publication of the Madras proposals before committing themselves. In January the budget was formulated and proved to be reasonably founded on the principle of limiting expenditure to available income.
Out of an opening balance of 50 laths for financing new schemes, the Ministry-propose to spend 15 lakhs on irrigation works, 6 lakbs on village pancbayats, and 28 lakhs on education. The budget includes provision for a scheme of &quot;prohibition &quot; which is estimate&apos;! to cost 30 lakhs. The Ministry also propose to introduce a Bill for the reform of local bodies whereby the system of official nominations will be abolished ; there is some Muslim opposition to the proposal, but the Ministry have undertaken to provide adequate representation for minorities.11. Central Provinces. In November the Minister for Local Self-government surprised everybody, his colleagues included, by producing a scheme for the reform of local bodies of such an advanced nature that it was greeted with disapproval both by the Cabinet and by members of the Legislature. The Governor had to persuade him to drop it, and it has so far not been raised again. The scheme is described fully in paragraph 51. The Economy Committee submitted its report, in which the need of Commissioners was recognised, and the chief recommendation, which has not yet been acted upon, was the abolition of Financial Commissioners in favour of a Board of Revenue. In December the Ministry decided to follow the Bombay Governments lead by effecting a clean-up in the system of Honorary Magistrates ; all persons judged to be incompetent magistrates are to be weeded out, and it is expected that 60 per cent, will have to go. In January &quot; prohibition &quot; was introduced in selected areas. The Law Minister, Sharif, introduced sweeping changes in the Law Department, most of which are clearly designed to give Congress an opportunity for patronage; they include the abolition of the post of Government Pleader and the dismissal of all Public Prosecutors preparatory to appointing new ones on new scales of pay ; it is suspected that Congress nominees will occupy many of the new posts.12. Madras-.  The Ministry had proposed to introduce a Moratorium Bill to stay suits for certain debts pending the passage into law of a complicated Bill for the relief of agricultural debt. In November they were compelled to drop the Moratorium Bill owing to the strength of the opposition to it, whereupon the Premier suggested that he might get the moratorium enforced in the form of an Ordinance in order to avoid criticism in the Legislature. Ultimately he dropped this proposal also. In the same month the Ministry formulated their proposals for cuts in the salaries of the Services, about which, after several weeks of discussion, orders issued in January. This subject is discussed in detail in paragraph 46. In December the provisions of the Madras Agriculturists&apos; Relief Bill were published and aroused a storm of opposition among interested sections of the population. Many of the Congress members of the Legislature are opposed to it because they are creditors and expect to be adversely affected, but for the sake of party discipline they have to submit to it. The Ministry are expected to make many concessions to the opposition in passing the Bill. The Ministry also put forward a proposal to restore such village officers as were dismissed during the civil disobedience movement, and intend to restore them all unless any special reasons prevent it in individual cases.Following the example of the United Provinces Government, the Madras Government have been considering a jail delivery on a large scale. Their original proposals were very indiscriminate and have since been considerably modified ; the present intention is to release only such prisoners as will not be a danger to the public peace, and the advice of the Inspector-General of Police is being taken in each case. Although the original suggestion appeared alarming, the present scheme is comparatively innocuous, and the main purpose of it is economy. Lather less than 2,000 prisoners are expected to be released.The preliminary budget statement for the next finencial year has recently been drawn up ; the present year will close with a surplus of 14J lakhs and a surplus of 11-1- lakhs is estimated for the next year. The Premier intends to introduce new taxation on tobacco and agricultural incomes to make up for the loss sustained as a result of the enforcement of &quot;prohibition,&quot; which he hopes to extend to another district in October next.13. North-Wesb Frontier.-ln November the Ministry made themselves unpopular by penalising six journals on the ground that they had deliberately misrepresented and attempted to discredit Government. This was subsequent to the issue of a Press note condemning the deliberate distortion of the truth in certain sections of the Press. In December the Ministry were contemplating an extravagant scheme of remissions of land revenue and water rates on the sugar-cane crop ; later
they came to the conclusion, on the representation of the Finance Secretary, that the remissions were too extravagant to be practicable, and they are now faced with the problem of reducing the rates of remissions without antagonising those people whose expectations of substantial relief are high. The Ministry propose to abolish the system of watch and ward by which villagers are entrusted with the protection of their villages^ but the possible effect on&apos; crime has still to be considered. Discussions are in progress about the enforcement of &quot;prohibition,&quot; but so far no concrete scheme has been evolved.14. Orissa. The Ministry have spent some time considering possible reforms in tenancy legislation, and are said to be proposing to introduce &quot;prohibition&quot; soon; they have chosen for this purpose an area largely populated by aboriginals, where drinking is particularly prevalent, so that hopes of making it a success are small.15. United Provinces. In November the Ministry considered the question of jail reform, and decided to release a large number of prisoners to ease congestion in jails and as a measure of economy. The principles on which releases were ordered were not unsound and no convict got a remission of more than one year of his sentence; about 3,000 convicts were released by early December. A scheme with dangerously subversive possibilities was invented in November and has recently been put into action ; it goes by the harmless name of Rural Development, but involves the employment of a small army of Congress workers in Government service all over the Province. The scheme and its possibilities are described fully in paragraph 51. In December the Ministry produced another proposal which may prove to have dangerous implications ; it is the reform of the system of Honorary Magistrates, and differs from the Bombay proposals in an important particular. The United Provinces Ministry intend to dismiss all Honorary Magistrates in February, but they will appoint new men under new rules to take their places. There is reason to suspect that this is a deliberate move to enable Congress nominees to wield power which they may well abuse throughout the Province. The Ministry intend to introduce &quot;prohibition&quot; in two comparatively unimportant areas as an experimental measure.(e) Legislatures : Events of the Sessions.1(5. Bihar. The Legislative Assembly sat from 1st to 23rd December, and passed the first Tenancy Amendment Bill and the Sugar Control Bill. The former excited keen controversy, but was finally accepted as revised - by the Select Committee.   The Upper House subsequently passed both Bills.17. Bombay. The Legislative Assembly met on 10th January and was still sitting at the end of the month. A resolution declaring that Federation is unacceptable to the House was introduced by the Premier and passed by an over-whelming majority, and was subsequently passed by the Upper House also. Another resolution passed in both Houses recommended the abolition of the system of awarding honours and titles. A Bill has been moved to reform local bodies, including in its provisions the abolition of official nominations to such bodies. It is believed that the Government will introduce a Bill to enforce a moratorium for one year, to benefit all small landowners with holdings of five acres or less.18. Central Provinces. The Assembly had a session lasting from the 7th to 16th December. They passed the Tenancy Amendment Bill, but Government were taken aback to find that a definite and self-assertive opposition hampered many of their intentions. The Prohibition Bill was introduced, but the Opposition succeeded in getting consideration postponed ; similarly when Government tried to get a Land Revenue Amendment Bill referred to a Select Committee, the Opposition compelled them to circulate it for opinion.19. Madras. The Legislative Assembly met for a short session on 20th to 21st December, to introduce the Madras Agriculturists&apos; Relief Bill. The Upper House met on 21st December, and with their consent the Bill was referred to a Joint Select Committee of both Houses. The motion for reference was vigorously attacked but was carried easily.20. North -West Frontier Province. There have been no sessions of the Legislature. The Private Bill to repeal certain repressive sections of the law has emerged unchanged from the Select Committee ; the Premier admits that it is a bad
Bill and may succeed in having it withdrawn. A District Boards Amendment Bill has also come unchanged from Select Committee ; it seeks to abolish nominations, official presidents and the oath of allegiance of members.21. Orissa. The Legislative Assembly commenced a session on 24th January. Its activities up to the end of January deserve no special mention.; 22. United Provinces.-The Legislative Assembly met on 17th January and the Upper House on .21st January. Both Houses were still sitting at the end of the month. Resolutions were passed in the Assembly condemning Federation aud the award of titles, similar to those passed in Bombay. A Sugar Control Bill and a Bill to amend the United Provinces Court Fees Act were referred to Select Committee.(d) Relations of Ministers with Congress Central Command.23. The measure of control to be exercised by the Congress executive over Provincial Ministries was the subject of discussion at the Working Committee meeting at Calcutta at the end of October. The general feeling of Ministers was that their position was unenviable, their scope being limited on one side by the Governors powers and on the other by the criticism of the All-India Congress Committee. Gandhi contended that Ministers should be subjected to less criticism and allowed to use their discretion in dealing with local questions, particularly those affecting law and order. As a result the attitude of the All-India Congress Committee was modified to this extent, that they decided to keep control of policy in their own hands but to refrain from too much interference in administrative details. The Bombay Ministry appear to have convinced the leaders of the Congress that the use of emergency powers might be justifiable in the event of a serious strike in Bombay city. Rajagopalachari seems to have little respect for Central authority, Gandhi excluded ; it was he who surprised and silenced those who would have criticised the repressive measures taken against violent agitation, by delivering a stirring speech at the Bombay meeting of the Working Committee in January, in defence of those measures and against the spirit of lawlessness being spread abroad in the country.24. At the same time individual members of the Working Committee are still exercising their influence; in Bombay Vallabhai PateFs orders are faithfully executed by Desai, the Revenue Minister, so far as he is able, and Nehru has a close connection with affairs in the United Provinces. When the Governor of the United Provinces announced his ultimatum in the case of the prosecution of Parmanand for sedition, the Premiers first reaction was to consult Nehru and the Working Committee.25. The influence of the Working Committee in non-Congress Provinces is not much in evidence. In the Punjab there is a split in the ranks of the Congress Party and Nehru&apos;s attempts to heal it were a failure. His instructions that members of the Assembly should pay half their allowances to party funds were received writh no enthusiasm and as far as is known have not been obeyed. The Congress members of the Assembly in Sind ai*e said to resent interference by the Provincial Congress Committee. Nehru&apos;s tour in Assam, designed to win over that Province to Congress, is said to have had little result, and Congress manoeuvres to form a coalition Ministry in Bengal have proved a failure. The Congress leaders are so preoccupied with many pressing problems in the Congress Provinces that they can spare little time for their adherents in non-Congress Provinces where hopes of Congress success are remote.(e) Relations of Ministries with Governors : Social Contacts : Special Responsibilities.26. There is little doubt that most of the Congress Ministers realise the value of maintaining good relations with Governors and have a sincere desire to return the courtesy which they invariably receive. They disapprove of the Working Committee&apos;s ban on attendance at official functions of any kind, which has been characterised as &quot; shortsighted.&quot; Three months ago Gandhi, when asked for a ruling, said that it was clear that so long as the ban remained no Congressman could attend farewell parties given in honour of Governors or officials, and Ministers were timid in accepting invitations to any sort of formal or informal function at which the Governor was to preside, although there is every reason to believe that it 7143 C
was not their own inclination but the Working Committee&apos;s ban which held them back. In November, Jawaharlal Nehru wrote to the Premier of Bombay to say that the ban was not being strictly observed, but the Premier demanded a less strict interpretation of the rule and Nehru had to agree that a certain amount of latitude should perhaps be allowed. In accordance with this tendency, Ministers have gradually been relating the rule. *In Bihar, Bombay and the Central Provinces little progress has been made in social contacts so far ; when the Governor of Bombay toured in the Gujarat districts in December, Congress leaders took no part in official functions, though they made it clear that they were simply obeying orders and did not intend any discourtesy. In the United Provinces Mrs. Pandit, the Minister of Health, accepted the Governors invitation to an informal lunch party, but Ministers absented themselves from an Investiture darbar held by the Governor in December. In Madras, on the occasion of the Proclamation parade on 1st January, the Governor was surprised to see the Premier and some of the Ministers sitting in his private enclosure to watch this &quot; Imperialistic &quot; display. Yet when the Viceroy visited Madras 10 days later the Ministers only consented to be introduced at Government House before the inspection of the guard of honour and refused to be present at the quayside to meet His Excellency on arrival. In Orissa the three Ministers consented to dine with the Governor in November, but they refused to attend a darbar held by the Governor in January. It is in the North-West Frontier that the most satisfactory progress has been made ; the Premier has shown himself increasingly affable to British officers. (It will be recalled that he was once in the Indian Medical Service.) At the end of October he accepted an invitation to an Investiture at Government House on behalf of himself and his Ministers ; they would have attended had not Nehru turned up at the critical moment and forbidden them to go. Since that date the Premier has opened a calling book at his house and has exchanged calls with the District Commander and the General Officer Commanding.27. In the sphere of official as opposed to social relations, there have been instances of disagreement between Governors and Premiers, and Governors&apos; special responsibilities have been called into play behind the scenes. They have been used in most cases to prevent rather than to compel; and Ministers have always given way rather than bring on a breach. At the same time Governors have sometimes had to allow things which they would prefer to have prevented, such as the release of certain prisoners with dangerous records or reductions of salaries and allowances, because although these have been undesirable they have not been so serious as to necessitate an open breach. Most Ministries appear to have appreciated the need of mutual accommodation ; and the statement made by Subhas Bose, the new Congress President, that Congress Ministers make no secret of the fact that they apprehend friction with Governors has been denied by Ministers in Madras, Bombay and the North-West Frontier. In the Central Provinces the Governor on one occasion felt that it would be safe to absent himself from a Cabinet meeting, and the news that the Premier had presided was hailed as an example of the excellent relations existing between Governor and Premier. The Governor of Bombay has also recently been able to allow his Premier to preside over a Cabinet meeting.Only in the United Provinces has the Governor had to - use his special responsibility for the maintenance of public tranquillity to compel his Ministry to take action. He had to insist upon the prosecution of a seditionist (Parmanand) for a particularly objectionable speech containing incitement to violence; the Ministry took a serious view of his intervention and there was a possibility of their resignation until a compromise was reached.&apos; This incident is described in paragraph 57. Subsequent information has gone to show that the Congress leaders thought that the Premier was wrong in precipitating a crisis on this issue, but the incident shows that the active employment of the powers vested in Governors by the Act may lead to an open breach if Ministers choose to be unreasonable.(/) Relations of Ministers with their Secretariats.28. In some Provinces Ministers have not yet realised the limitations of their authority and have been inclined to interfere in matters which experience will doubtless teach them it is better to leave alone. This is probably due partly to ignorance or tactlessness, and partly to the desire to get quick results and make their power felt. In the North-West Frontier Province and Orissa, Ministers have been interfering in the transfers and appointments of subordinate officials; one
Minister in the North-West Frontier Province directed a head of a, department to advise junior revenue officials to &quot;improve their reputation for integrity.&quot; In Orissa the Minister for Education rejected the D.P.I.&apos;s proposals for postings without giving any reasons for so doing, apparently because he was approached by members of the Legislature. The result is that the D.P.I., a British officer, has applied to be permitted to retire on proportionate&apos; pension; the Premier is distressed at the loss of a valuable officer and has tried to persuade him to remain. This is the most serious result of ministerial interference in any Province, and it may prove to be a lesson to Ministers in general.29. Ministers have not infrequently adopted the method of issuing orders direct to subordinate officials and thus short-circuiting the Secretariat, particularly in Bihar and Orissa. In Bihar this practice led to an incident which achieved great notoriety in the Press. The Chief Secretary addressed a circular letter to Commissioners for communication to district officers which included the following-remarks :  &quot; An order of Government must be signed by the Secretar3r, Under Secretary or Assistant Secretary to Government, and no order which is not so signed is an authoritative order of Government. An officer who in an important matter acts on an order which purports to be issxied under any other authority does so at his own risk.&quot;This circular represented the correct position faithfully and has probably had the right effect, but it unexpectedly came to light and evoked an outburst of indignant disapproval, culminating in a motion of adjournment in the Bihar Assembly which was withdrawn when the .Premier said that investigation was proceeding. There is no information to show how the contents of the letter leaked out. The Chief Secretary explained that he had written it in his private capacity, but the Ministry were not satisfied until a second letter was issued withdrawing the first as being unofficial and unauthorised. The incident has not affected the relations between the Chief Secretary and the Premier.In Bombay, Ministers occasionally show signs of resenting legitimate criticism of their proposals by Secretaries. There appears to be a feeling in the Secretariat that Ministers have spies in the offices, and there is some reason to believe that Ministers have been &quot; getting at &quot; certain officials to supply them with information. There have been instances in which departments have not been consulted in the preparation of Bills which concern them ; the Premier has readily agreed that this rule of business must be kept.III.-NON-CONGRESS PROVINCES.(a) Ministries: Stability and Reputation.30. Assam. The Ministry have never enjoyed any feeling of security, and the pessimism which they felt three months ago has been justified ; they are now chiefly concerned with maintaining their shaky position. Apart from Saadulla, the Premier, the Ministers are not conspicuous for ability. The Cabinet&apos;s stock went down in December after a Government defeat in the Assembly, and at one time there were rumours of a motion of no confidence being moved against them. As early as November the Premier was considering the replacement of the Ministers for Education and Agriculture, Wahid and Ali Haidar, and subsequent events have forced him to decide to get rid of them, it appears that they neglected their work and were of little use in the Legislature. In December, 13 members of the Assembly demanded their resignation, and the rumours connected with their probable dismissal led to a split among the Muslims. A section of Muslim members of the Assembly profess to be satisfied with the Ministry as it is, amongst them being th&amp; two Ministers concerned ; the Premier is faced with the loss of the support of this section. Confronted with this difficulty the Premier has conceived the idea of purchasing a group of Hindu votes by creating a sixth Ministership, which will be given to a representative of the depressed classes, who will bring four certain votes with him. The Premier believes that he will then be able to count on 60 votes in a house of 108, and that this arrangement will give him security an opinion which the Governor does not endorse. There are objections to the appointment of an extra Minister : it is justifiable neither on administrative
mgrounds nor financially, but it is hoped to overcome the financial difficulty by persuading the new Minister to accept a lower salary and the other Ministers to contribute partially to it. The alternative to an extra appointment might be the resignation of SaaduhVs Cabinet, when Congress would come in.31. Bengal. During November there was much speculation as to the formation of a Coalition CabiSet in Bengal with several Congress members included in it. There were definite intrigues to form such a Cabinet, and its composition had actually been decided six Muslims and three Hindus. Congress efforts were directed at winning over Sarkar, the Finance Minister ; Fazlal Haq, the Premier, had earned considerable unpopularity by his alliance with the Muslim League and by some intemperate speeches, and the attitude of the Press and Congress to the Ministry was uncompromisingly antagonistic. In spite of this &quot; scare&quot; the intrigues failed and eventually died down, and at present there appears to be no danger to the Ministry. The main threat to the stability of the Ministry in the quarter arose from the agitation over the terrorists in the Andamans, and the allied agitation for the release of detenus, but this lost strength with the repatriation of the terrorist convicts.32. Punjab. The Premier&apos;s decision to join hands with the Muslim League caused surprise and some consternation at first; it is said that he did not appreciate the importance of the step he had taken for some time, and that he had not consulted his colleagues about it. The various parties in the Legislature were expecting a statement to clarify the results of the decision, but the Premier has not yet made one, and actually the results of the decision are practically none ; not a single member of the Unionist Party has joined the League, apparently because Jinnah is nowhere trusted and his &quot; negotiations &quot; with Congress are viewed with dismay.Governments position is still secure, though their organisation is inferior. Ministers have complained that their supporters are restive at the absence of spectacular measures; they are inclined to rush proposals through with insufficient consideration, and the Governor finds that he is giving advice more and more frequently as time goes on. Permanent Secretaries are dismayed at the lack of political sagacity displayed-by Ministers, who give insufficient attention to legislative measures and seem to have no time to attend to party organisation. The Premier&apos;s attitude to law and order is satisfactory, and Government show no signs of yielding to the demands of the hunger-striking convicts or the Shahidganj agitators two cases which are described more fully in paragraphs 68 and 53.33. Bind. The Ministry is still in office in spite of its previous insecurity. In October the only Hindu Minister, Govind Ram, in charge of Public Works, resigned. He was pursuing an active business career, unknown to the Governor, and was in fact managing partner of a firm engaged in cotton transactions. He lost six or seven lakhs in the business and applied to the Revenue Commissioner for protection under the Sind Encumbered Estates Act. At this point the Governor, the Premier and Govind Ram came to the conclusion that he must resign. In his place another Hindu was appointed, Dr. Hemandas Wadhwani, and though this led to a split in the ranks of the Hindus, Government were not perturbed by the loss of a few votes, and there no indications of insecurity or dissensions in the Cabinet.(b) Ministries&apos; Programmes.34. Assam. As a result of a resolution moved in the August session of the Assembly, the Ministry had to set up a Committee to enquire into the possibility of reduction in land revenue. The Committee recommended an all-round reduction of 33^ per cent., which will involve a loss of 10 lakhs, to which the Ministry have had to agree reluctantly as they realise that the Province&apos;s finances can stand the loss with difficulty. The Ministry are also contemplating the introduction of &quot; prohibition &quot; in one district, but the proposal is not yet concrete.35. Bengal. The Ministry have been largely concerned in escaping from commitments made too hastily during the Assembly session, which would cause financial embarrassment. They set up an authoritative Committee to consider tenancy questions. Their proposed Secondary Education Bill has earned a great deal of criticism. In November they decided to release 1,100 detenus, and have since been trying to solve the problem of finding them employment ; this subject
is discussed at length in paragraph 62. The Ministry&apos;s proposal to introduce &quot;prohibition&quot; in one district has been the subject of some amusement, as they are accused of choosing a district which returns the smallest amount of Excise revenue. Their attitude to law and order is satisfactory.36. Punjab. The Ministry are considering a bold and ambitious constructive programme of expenditure for the next financial year. The problem of giving substantial relief in lancPrevenue as a political move without ruining the financial prospects of the Province was under consideration, but they have decided that no relief is necessary in 1938-39. They are, meanwhile, exploring possibilities of new taxation. A surplus of 34 lakhs for the last year and an estimated surplus of 24 lakhs next year make budget prospects satisfactory. The Ministry hope to resist the demand for land revenue reduction by appealing to the public imagina-tion by constructive efforts, and propose a generous programme of beneficent activities and a special five-year programme of rural development costing 10 lakhs per annum. So far no proposals have been put forward for the introduction of &quot; prohibition.&quot;37, Sind. There is nothing particular to record.(c) Legislatures : Events of the Sessions.38. Assam. The Legislative Council sat at the end of October to discuss the Ministers&apos; and Members&apos; Emoluments Bill, and carried an amendment to the effect that each member should draw a monthly salary of one rupee only and a daily allowance of 10 rupees, compared with the monthly salary of Rs. 100 and daily allowance of five rupees passed by the Assembly. The Assembly met on 8th December, and on the 14th the Premier moved that the amendments in the Bill be taken into consideration ; this motion was defeated and the Bill now goes back to the Upper House.The most important event of the Assembly session was the action taken in respect of the Commissionerships. In the August session the Opposition had procured a cut in the budget of Rs. 75,000 for Commissioners&apos; staff, and three months&apos; notice had to be served on the staff concerned. On 18th December the Assembly agreed to a supplementary demand to cover the staffs salary up to 31st December, which meant that from 1st January there would be two Commissioners, but no staff. On the 21st December, therefore, the Governor, having failed to persuade the Premier to do any more, put in a further supplementary demand to cover the staffs salaries to the end of the financial year. The Speaker then ruled that there was no provision in the Assembly rules by which the demand could be considered and voted on the same day, and as the 21st December was the last day of the session the demand could not be voted. In this dilemma the Governor decided to leave things as they were and carry on the establishment without laying on the table any schedule of expenditure. To certify the expenditure the same day would have caused much resentment and there were many objections to prolonging the session. The Government have put forward a proposal for the abolition of one Commissionership, which is under the consideration of the Secretary of State.39. Bengal. -The Legislative Assembly commenced a session on 24th January. Nothing has yet occurred which deserves mention.40. Punjab. The Legislative Assembly held a special session on 10th January to 29th January to introduce the Rules of Procedure for the House. Slow progress was made with the rules and the House adjourned before they were all dealt with; they will be taken up again at the next session.   Government suffered no defeats.41. Sind. There have been no meetings of the Legislature.IV. CHIEF COMMISSIONERS&apos; PROVINCES.t.42. In these centrally-administered areas there has been little activity worth recording. In and concerning Ajmer-Merwara there has been some agitation as the result of rumours published in the Press that the Central Government was bargaining with two Indian States, offering them parts of the Province in exchange for a promise to join the Federal scheme. Jawaharlal Nehru gave impetus to the agitation in the preceding quarter ; and the published explanation that the villages 7143 D
to be restored to the administration oi tbe two States have never been a part of British India, but have been under British management for reasons which no longer exist, has not altogether stopped the controversy. In December the liajputana Provincial Muslim League passed a resolution suggesting that a new Province be created with its capital at Delhi and including Ajmer and certain districts of the Punjab and the United Provinces, the real purpose of the resolution lying in the last sentence, &quot;Imd that the people of the new Province may enjoy the privileges of the new Constitution.&quot; Agitation for reforms attracts little public response and a Students&apos; Conference organised for January fell flat, as no important Congress leader could be persuaded to attend. At the end of January, Bhulabhai Desai, the leader of the Congress Party in the Central Assembly, presided at the Ajmer Political Conference, which adopted a resolution for amalgamation of the Province with the United Provinces. This is no new proposal; but is strongly urged by Congress politicians now that the United Provinces are under a Congress Ministry.43. There is also some agitation for reforms in Coorg and Delhi. The Legis-lative Council of Coorg passed a resolution expressing dissatisfaction at the failure to respond to the repeated demands for further progress towards responsible government demands which fail to take into account the Province&apos;s inability to meet the cost of its present administration. Delhi has come into the limelight owing to the action taken by the Chief Commissioner in serving the revolutionary prisoners released in the United Provinces with a notice to quit the Province at once when they endeavoured to join the agitation for the release of terrorist prisoners in India, and in arresting them when they refused ; this action was condemned as another example of the Central Governments ruthless repression.44. The Central Government have hitherto been acting as jailors for Provincial Governments both in the Andamans and in Ajmer-Merwara. In the Anclamans about 300 terrorist convicts, mostly from Bengal, have been confined in the Cellular Jail; at Deoli, in Ajmer-Merwara, about 400 Bengal detenus were accommodated in a temporary jail built for the purpose. This arrangement involved a division of responsibility, the inconveniences of which, after the advent of Provincial Autonomy, were foreseen by the Central Government.; and these became very apparent when the hunger strike in both jails brought pressure from, different angles to bear on the Central Government and on the Provincial Govern-ments concerned some of which, as regards the terrorists in the Andamans, were Congress in complexion. With the abandonment of the hunger strike both the Cellular Jail in the Andamans and the Deoli Jail in Ajmer-Merwara were evacuated, and the prisoners transferred to their Provinces. There remain in the Andamans over 6,000 convicts, of a casual and not professionally criminal type, who have been transferred there at their own desire and with the consent of the Provincial Governments. This arrangement is of benefit to all concerned  to the Central Government since the Andamans administration needs the labour provided by tbe convicts, to the Provinces since they are relieved of the cost of accommodating and maintaining these prisoners, and to the convicts since in the Andamans they live a practically free life, with every facility for development into law-abiding and self-sufficient citizens on their return to India after their sentences have expired. Some of the Congress Ministries have made requests indicating a desire to terminate the arrangement ; they have withdrawn them on the benefits of the system being explained, but it is probable that they will refrain from sending more prisoners to the Andamans, and the progressive fall in the number of the convicts in the Settlement will force on the Andamans administration a problem of man-power which may not be easy to solve.V.-GENERAL SUBJECTS.to) Treatment of the Services: Service Feeling: Services&apos; Pay and Allowances.45. In non-Congress Provinces ^relations between the Services and Ministers and the public call for little remark, conditions having altered very little since the introduction of Provincial Autonomy. Congress workers have made occasional attempts to stir up feeling against the police in the Punjab with little success ; in Assam the feeling against Commissionerships represents a desire to effect economy rather than any anti-service antagonism.
15176In the majority of Congress Provinces some improvement in the attitude of Congress to the Services is noticeable. The position in the United Provinces will be treated separately. The feeling of apprehension which was prevalent, especially among Indian officers, is gradually being dispelled ; special mention has been made of the happier atmosphere prevailing in Bihar and the North-West Frontier, while in the Central Provinces Ministers are said to be agreeably surprised by the co-operation of Government officials, and the Premier has insisted on proper courtesy being shown to them. The police are still meeting with some opposition and criticism; in the Central Provinces irresponsibles have made speeches minimising the authority of Government servants and abusing the police ; in. Bombay Congress workers have made sporadic attempts to interfere with police work and have indulged in abusive language against the force, but the authority of the service has not been impaired; certain officers are said to feel that they are marked men and are afraid of the vindictive wrath of the Revenue Minister. In the North-West Frontier the Red Shirts have formed a sort of village police organisation, and though they have instructed it to assist the ordinary police the latter are hardly reassured. When Abdul Ghaffar toured the Province in November, though he advocated assistance to officials the general result of his speeches was an enhancement of Congress prestige vis-d-vis that of Government officers. Respect for the police is said to have decreased in this Province, but the Premier continues to sing their praises. In Bihar the police are said to be getting help rathpr than hindrance from Congress workers, and Ministers do their best to check any violent speaking against the Services-In the United Provinces it cannot be said with any certainty that improvement is yet established-. Largely as a result of the lack of control over forces of disorder and to the relaxation of the orders requiring speeches to be reported, irresponsible agitators seized the opportunity to indulge in speeches directed against the Services, especially the police. With the professed object of improving relations between Congress and Government servants, the Government in November issued a circular letter to all district officers. The circular stated that complaints had been received about the unsatisfactory relations existing between the two sides, and that the time had come for Government officers to &quot; establish relations of mutual confidence with the district leaders of Congress organisation.&quot; It emphasised that Congress was the party on which the present Government relies for support, and went on to say that Government is interested in seeing that &quot;malpractices and cases of neglect of duty on the part of public servants should be enquired into and corrected &quot; ; and it observed that it is the duty of Government servants to give due attention to such cases, so that the establishment of relations of confidence and harmony was essential. The circular was naturally criticised as treating members of Congress as synonymous with the general public; and members of other parties (e.g. the Muslim League) resented the omission of all mention of parties other than the Congress. It is also open to the interpretation of requiring Government servants to adopt a conciliatory attitude towards Congress workers without en joining-reciprocity. The effect on the public can hardly have been to dispel the impression that as a medium of obtaining redress the Congress organisation is specially privileged. This circular was followed by another couched in similar terms addressed by the Provincial Congress Committee to all district Congress leaders. The effect of these communications on the morale of the services cannot yet be properly estimated. On the one hand, recent reports indicate that there is no hostility towards officials among the. common folk, and that Government officers are in many districts regarded as the one reliable element in an unstable situation. On the other hand, the effect on some officers may be reflected in a circular issued by one Superintendent of Police to his subordinates and immediately published in a newspaper, which betrayed a most unfortunate attitude.For the time being disrespect for and abuse of the police in the United Provinces&apos;appear to have increased. Released convicts who toured the Province in October and November delivered speeches in which the prevailing idea was inculcation of active hostility to the police and the British Government generally. This agitation culminated in an &quot; anti-police day &quot; in Cawnpore at the end of October, which was organised by local Congress leaders; the local Congress President made a speech marked by filthy abuse of the police and other speakers advocated murder and pillage. The speeches were not reported so no action could be taken against the offenders.
In November two attacks were made on policemen effecting arrests; in Allahabad a constable executing a warrant was obstructed by Congressmen; a Communist leader advised an audience in Lucknow to resort to anti-police agitation as an easy method of rousing public sympathy. Similar cases of abuse and interference were reported in January. The Premier&apos;s own attitude is equivocal; at avpolice parade he delivered au unnecessarily critical homily, and though he seemed to be impressed by good police work in the labour troubles at Cawnpore in November, in more recent speeches he continues to harp on complaints received against the police and to advise them to regain the confidence of the public. It remains to be seen whether the prestige of the police in this Province has suffered any permanent injury.46. Services&apos; Pay and Allowances. When the Premier of Madras found himself obliged to give up his proposal for a voluntary cut in Services&apos; pay, he took up the question of a compulsory cut in the pay of Provincial and subordinate service officers. In November he was planning to reduce the pay of all members of the Provincial Services, those holding existing posts as well as future entrants, and had drafted a letter to the Government of India containing a request to move the Secretary of State to sanction the application of the cut to those existing holders of posts whose salaries could not be touched without his sanction. The letter even held out a threat of resignation if sanction should be refused. The Governor, in consultation with the Governor-General, persuaded him to abandon these ideas and to submit a memorandum conveying his views for transmission to the Viceroy.The point at issue was the application of the cut to existing holders of posts ; the policy decided in consultation with the Secretary of State was as follows. Provincial Governments undoubtedly have the power to reduce the salaries of officers who were recruited after 1st April 1937, and there is held to be no ground for objecting to this reduction being applied (generally speaking) to officers who were recruited before this date on their promotion to superior grades. But there are no good grounds for effecting economy by the drastic method of reducing the pay of existing holders of posts, and it was decided that any proposal of this nature must be flatly refused by Governors, even if it meant a complete breach with their Ministers, in the exercise of their responsibility for safeguarding the legitimate interests of the Services. The possibility should not be excluded of reducing the pay of existing holders of posts in the event of grave financial stringency, but even in such a contingency any reduction would have to be justified on merits ; and the. possibility was not to be brought to the notice of Ministers, since an artificial financial crisis could be created.Meanwhile the Madras Premier was working out, with the Governors consent, the new scales of pay to apply to new entrants, and in the middle of December he suddenly dropped his proposal to apply them to existing holders of posts, and the problem was solved. Care was taken to ensure that the orders to be issued should contain precise and proper definitions of the posts which were to be affected. The orders were issued on 31st December to take effect from 1st January. The scale of reductions is as follows : On salaries of Rs. 200 and below 5 per cent.On salaries of Rs. 200-300 &quot;i\ per cent.On salaries of Rs. 300-50O 15 per cent.On salaries of Rs. 500-1,000-20 per cent.On salaries of Rs. 1,000 or over 30 per cent.The new scales will also apply to officers promoted to the posts affected.47. At about the same time as the Madras Ministry were formulating their first proposals, the Bombay Ministry announced that they wished to impose a graded cut up to 25 per cent, on all salaries over Rs. 100 of officers of the Provincial and Subordinate Services ; by the middle of December certain modifications had been s, made, but the Ministry&apos;s decision to get the cut applied to existing holders of posts remained unaltered. On 31st December the Governor, in accordance with the Viceroy&apos;s instructions, informed the Premier that he could not agree to reductions in the salaries of staff recruited before 1st April 1937. The Premier accepted this decision, though with the observation that it might cause grave difficulties. As soon as Madras orders were published and fully understood, the Bombay Premier similarly dropped the idea of applying a cut to the existing staff, and the problem in Bombay is now the comparatively straightforward one of working out the scales for new entrants.
The Premiers of the North-West Frontier and the United Provinces have occasionally mentioned that they are considering pay cuts ; no proposals have been put forward, though it is probable that many of the Provinces will follow the lead given them by Madras. No overt attack has been made on the pay of the Secretary of State&apos;s Services.48. Reduction of Allowances. The problem of reducing travelling allowances in Bombay, which was undecided at the end of October, was settled early in November, the Governor agreeing to the Ministry&apos;s proposal for an all-round reduction of 10 per cent, with a proviso that if any officer found himself out of pocket as a result, he could apply for reimbursement of legitimate expenses; this arrangement was only temporary pending an enquiry into the subject, which has not yet concluded. The Finance Minister promised to apply the proviso reasonably and his ultimate proposals are not expected to be drastic.Later in November the Central Provinces Ministry formulated tentative proposals for reduction of travelling allowances. They intended to reduce the daily allowance of senior touring officers from its. 5 to Us. 4, and junior officers&apos; allowance on a graded scale. These proposals were not unreasonable, but they also intended to allow 1st class railway fare only to the most senior officers such as High Court Judges, Financiai Commissioners, Commissioners, Heads of Departments and Secretaries to Government; Deputy Commissioners were to be allowed only 2nd class fare along with all officers earning Rs. 250 or more. The proposals have not yet been more definitely pressed.49. In the North-West Frontier a small reduction in road mileage allowance has been made. In the United Provinces there is some talk of the abolition of special pay and compensatory allowances attached to certain posts. In Madras the Premier has under consideration a proposal to abolish enhanced pensions which are awarded to officers holding certain high positions who have a meritorious record of service. He intends to abolish all such pensions for future incumbents of posts which are now held by members of Provincial Services, as well as future Provincial Service incumbents who are appointed to such posts now held by All-India Service officers. The All-India Services are thus not affected by the proposals.(b) Interference with the Administration : Signs of Parallel administration in the Districts.50. Instances of actual interference with the administration have been confined to two Provinces, the Central Provinces and the United Provinces. Congress workers recently made an attempt to interfere in a police investigation in the Punjab, but this was resented by the public.Reports were received from the Central Provinces in December that attempts were being made to form a parallel administration. In one district a speaker advocated the submission of all grievances through Congress village committees, and the Revenue Minister made a public promise that complaints regarding forcible recoveries of Government loans would receive immediate attention if they were sent through Presidents of local Congress Committees ; he promptly received a number of complaints against the Revenue staff and the police. Instanpes of similar advice being given in speeches were reported in other districts. Though the prestige of Government officers naturally suffers from this form of propaganda, the effect in this Province has not been serious.In the United Provinces there have been a number of instances of interference. In November cases were reported of Congress workers interfering in police investigations by taking down statements before the police arrived, by shadowing the police to such an extent that any private conversation with possible witnesses was impossible, and by obstructing officers attempting to execute warrants. These activi ties depressed the police, who found themselves continually on the defensive against the possibility of charges being made against their methods. Bad characters were reported to be less under control, as they expected that Congress would support them against the police. In Bihar a so-called &quot; Congress Police Force&quot; has been created; its purpose and the extent of its activities are being investigated.51. In addition to the instances given above, a more deliberate approach to parallel administration has come to notice in the past two months in the form of two schemes for which Ministers in the same two Provinces are responsible.  In the
United Provinces a programme of rural development has been put into force, under which the Province is divided into divisions in charge of Superintendents who control a number of districts, each district having a special committee appointed by Government. The whole organisation is under the control of a Rural Development Officer, and suspicion was at once aroused when Government appointed a no^prious left-wing Congress agitator to the post. The scheme naturally requires the employment of a large number of subordinate officials, for whofie instruction training camps were opened. A description of one of these training camps revealed that the training was political rather than agricultural, and there is little doubt that Congress nominees will occupy the majority of the posts, with the result that a large organisation of Congress workers, paid by and under the orders of Government, will exist in every corner of the Province, with unlimited powers of spreading partly propaganda and exalting the Congress regime. The Muslims of the Province have already expressed their dismay at the possibilities inherent in the scheme, and their views were given publicity in the Assembly.The other scheme is one for reform in local self-government. In the Central Provinces Misra, the Minister for Local Self-Government, without consulting his colleagues, worked out an elaborate scheme, whereby each district in the Province was to have a council with control over nearly all the district officer&apos;s activities, including the collection of land revenue, and excluding only his judicial functions. The district officer, whose authority was to be reduced to a minimum, was apparently intended to be a sort of secretary to the council, which was to have an elected president. This scheme was so revolutionary and so impracticable that the Governor and the rest of the Ministry agreed in condemning it, and the Governor persuaded Misra to drop his intention of introducing it ; Misra is expected to revive it some day in a modified form.In the United Provinces a committee of &quot; experts &quot; was appointed to examine and suggest amendments in the Local Self-Government Act. Their suggestions, as reported in the Press, include the formation of elected local boards with a chairman exercising magisterial powers in cases arising out of the Act, the removal of all judicial functions under the Act from the authority of Commissioners and District Magistrates, and the elimination of all official control over the boards, who shall be allowed a measure of control over the police. These revolutionary ideas have not been considered by Government and the proposals are only in their initial stage, but if they have been correctly reported they may indicate roughly the sort of &quot; reforms &quot; which Congress extremists would like to introduce.(c) Parliamentary Secretaries.52. The Premiers of seven Provinces appointed Parliamentary Secretaries in 1937, but it was evident that in some Provinces there was confusion about the correct allocation of duties to them and a tendency to give them functions which they should not exercise and which encroached both on the field of the permanent secretariat and on the authority of the district staff. - The Premier of Bombay confessed that he was not sure what a Parliamentary Secretary&apos;s duties were; in Bihar a Parliamentary Secretary interfered in an investigation connected with law and order ; in the United Provinces Ministers have expressed a desire to delegate part of their authority to Parliamentary Secretaries, who have also been agitating for wider powers, and Ministers have been inclined to hand over to these Secretaries any jobs which they are unable to undertake personally.The importance of checking such tendencies and of defining the nature and extent of the duties of Parliamentary Secretaries was soon realised, and the Governor-Geueral, in consultation with the Secretary of State and Provincial Governors, has now laid down certain principles to be followed. Functions of Parlia-mentary Secretaries should be confined as far as is practicable to the Parliamentary field and they should not be encouraged to do any more administrative work than is essential. By degrees when Parliamentary Secretaries have gained experience they might, be permitted to do some administrative work, but the limits within which such functions can be exercised are to be defined as precisely as possible. Governors are advised in the course of their discussions with Ministers to emphasise that the Ministers alone are responsible for their departments, that they alone can advise the Governor, and that the position of Permanent Secretaries is provided for in section 59 of the Government of India Act, so that there can be no question of a Parliamentary Secretary discharging a duty which has been assigned to a Permanent Secretary.,
19178Eight Parliamentary Secretaries have been appointed in Bihar, six in Bombay, four in Orissa, three in Sind, and thirteen in the United Provinces ; appointments have also been made in Madras and the Punjab, but none in Assam, Bengal, the Central Provinces or the North-West Frontier Province.(d) Attitude of Ministries to Law and Order; Reporting of Speeches ;,&quot; Repressive &apos;Legislation and Restrictions, &amp;c.53: The attitude of non-Congress Ministries to the maintenance of law and order has undergone no great change ; its basic idea is the prevention of anything which will disturb public tranquillity.   Assam and Sind have had no serious troubles ; in Bengal the only disturbing feature is a hunger-strike of terrorist prisoners, which began in Dacca in the last week of January, as part of a concerted all-India attempt to force Governments to release all such prisoners. This is discussed in paragraph 68. It is sufficient to say here that the Bengal Government, which successfully met the hunger-strike of Andamans convicts in August, does not intend to yield to their demands.   In the Punjab a similar hunger-strike is in pi-ogress, and the same firmness is being displayed by that Government.   In December a section of militant Muslims known as the Ahrars resuscitated the agitation for the restoration to the Muslims of the Shahidganj mosque, which is at present under the control of Sikhs.  The agitators adopted a form of civil disobedience, parties of five volunteers marching daily to the mosque in contravention of restrictive orders, and being duly arrested and jailed.    Up to the end of January nearly 200 persons had been arrested, 158 of whom were convicted.   This agitation is almost entirely political and is intended to embarrass the Muslim Ministry, as Ahrar sympathies are pro-Congress and it is generally believed that Congress funds are assisting the agitators.   Government have not yielded ; arrests and convictions have been going on regularly and there is little public response to the agitation.   Recently the High Court announced its judgment in the civil suit lodged for possession of the mosque, and decided it in favour of the Sikhs ; the effect of the judgment remains to be seen, but it is believed that the agitation will spread, although up to the present it has had little effect.54. In Congress Provinces there has been a widening breach between the forces of order and disorder., the followers of non-violence and the left-wing extremists. The history of this important development is discussed more fully in paragraph 82 ; events in the various Provinces will be described here.55. Bihar. Government have had to deal with violent agrarian agitation, which is described in paragraph 71. They have raised no objection to coercive action by the police and magistrates, and they passed special orders requiring agitators&apos; speeches to be reported verbatim, but the strongest controlling influence was the Provincial Congress Committee, which denounced the agitation and banned any participation in it.56. Bombay. Governments attitude to law and order has been satisfactorily firm; Communists have never relaxed their efforts to create labour trouble, and engineered a strike in Ahmedabad which had dangerous possibilities. Government wasted no time in issuing restrictive orders and controlled the situation successfully (see paragraph 78). In Sholapur in November Communists started agitation in a settlement of criminal tribes, to whom they represented that they were not criminals but honest citizens reduced to their present condition by the dictates of British Imperialism. They soon aroused a spirit of insubordination by means of violent and objectionable speeches; as soon as the first signs of violence appeared Government brought the situation under control by the issue of restrictive orders and the despatch of armed police to the settlement. The Bombay Ministry are alive to the dangers of Communism, and have hitherto resisted the temptation to repeal the Emergency Powers Act, which is an effective weapon in dealing with severe^labour trouble.No trouble has arisen in the Central Provinces, Madras (where the Premier is an ardent upholder of the policy of non-violence), or the North-West Frontier. The Orissa Government (with the consent of the Governor) have repealed the Bihar and Orissa Public Safety Bill so far as it applies to Orissa. In November a member of the Assembly made a seditious speech for which he deserved prosecution ; the Premier was unwilling to take action and an unconditional apology and promise of good behaviour were accepted instead.
57. United Provinces.  Pandit Pant, the Premier, who is in charge of the law and order portfolio, showed indecision in dealing with problems of exceptional gravity. Although he was aware of the subversive activity and propaganda of extremists and Communists in many parts of the Province, he could not be persuaded to take firm action and contented himself with trying the effect of persuasion and negotiation, while the labour trouble in Cawnpore and the agrarian agitation (which are described in paragraphs 79 and 72 respectively) developed to a dangerous point.In December matters came to a head. The released ICakori convicts had been touring the Province, making revolutionary speeches which Government made no real attempt to check. When they visited the western districts they were accompanied by one Parmanand, an ex-revolutionary convict from the Punjab, who, at Dehra Dun on 15th November, delivered a most objectionable speech containing clear incitements to murder and violence. On receipt of reports of this speech the Governor informed the Premier that a prosecution muse be launched, but the Premier, declined to take the responsibility, whereupon the Governor insisted in the exercise of his special responsibility for the maintenance of peace and tranquillity. . The Premier unwillingly complied, making it clear that it was a matter of such grave importance that he must consult the Centre and might be forced to resign. In the meantime Parmanand and bis companions had been arrested on a separate charge in Delhi, where they deliberately disobeyed restrictive orders imposed on them. Pant took advantage of this to urge that the other prosecution should be dropped, though there was no connection between the two cases ; he also refused to demand any assurance of good behaviour from Parmanand before dropping the prosecution, and refused to issue a general warning as a preliminary to future prosecutions, insisting that individual warnings must precede prosecution in each case, which meant that every revolutionary agitator would be entitled to commit one offence with impunity.Pant&apos;s attitude created a problem of considerable difficulty, as his resignation would have produced an awkward situation. Finally, after Parmanand had been convicted and sentenced in Delhi, a compromise was effected in consultation with the Secretary of State ; the prosecution for the Dehra Dun speech was given up on the condition that the Premier issued a severe general warning against seditious speaking, in which was included a statement that no further individual warning-would be given as a preliminary to prosecution.58. Reporting of Speeches. The accurate reporting of speeches at political . meetings has always been considered an important part of police work, any failure or relaxation in the system being an open invitation to agitators and irresponsibles to indulge in seditious or otherwise objectionable speaking. Orders issued by Ministries in certain Provinces relaxing the strictness of the procedure for obtaining such reports are therefore disturbing, and in the United Provinces have had serious results. Before Congress Ministries took office adequate orders on the subject existed all over India, and no changes have been made in the existing practice in any non-Congress Province.Instructions of varying importance (intended to relax the strictness of the procedure) have been passed by every Congress Ministry except in Bihar, Orissa and the North-West Frontier Province. In Bihar the Ministry have discouraged detailed reporting, though no orders have been issued, and the result is that in practice speeches are not reported or are reported briefly. In September the Ministry, alarmed at the agrarian agitation, ordered verbatim reports to be made of the speeches of certain listed agitators. In Bombay the Ministers apparently thought that their dignity and that of Congressmen generally was threatened by the presence of reporters ; they were, however, persuaded to issue no orders beyond instructions that the police should &quot;act with circumspection&quot; when collecting information. Ministers&apos; speeches are not reported. In November the Ministry-required full reports of speeches made by members of the Muslim League. In the Central Provinces the system-of reporting has practically been destroyed by orders to the effect that reporters should rely on their memory save in exceptional cases. One of the earliest acts of the Madras Ministry was to order that speeches at Congress meetings need not be reported in future, though speeches by revolutionaries and irresponsibles are to be reported as in the past. In the North-West Frontier no changes have been made in the existing system, and in Orissa the only difference is that speeches of Ministers are not reported.   The United Provinces Ministry
reversed all previous orders by issuing instructions in September that speeches at ordinary political meetings need no longer be reported at all, and by laying down an elaborate procedure to be adopted by district officers who considered that reporting was necessary in special instances. Events in Cawnpore and the series of objectionable speeches made by released convicts induced a modification of these orders, and in December District Magistrates were given full discretion to order reports to be made whenever they apprehend any trouble.59. Restrictions on the Press. Since the acceptance of office by Congress the Press has enjoyed greater freedom in Congress Provinces ; the Governments have cancelled many of the securities which had been deposited under the Press Act, and have refrained from demanding securities from new ventures, in accordance with the Congress ideal of liberty of speech. In the United Provinces particularly publishers have taken advantage of this freedom to publish newspapers on which restrictions in non-Congress Provinces would still be imposed. The clearest case is that of the Kirti, the organ of the revolutionary Sikh-Ghadr Party, which ceased publication in the Punjab in March 1937 owing to restrictions placed upon it, and restarted in November in Meerut, where no security was demanded, and the case, was not even referred to the police for advice. In Madras a new organ of the. Communist Party called the New Age has appeared, and though the police have referred it to Government twice no security has been demanded.(e) &quot; Political &quot; Prisoners and Detenus.60, The problem of the release of revolutionary and terrorist prisoners may be divided into three parts. Bengal has its own problem of detenus as well as other &quot;political&quot; prisoners, which is considered in paragraph 62. The second part of the problem, relating to the terrorist convicts from the Andaman Islands, has recently been brought to a conclusion by the repatriation of the last batch of these convicts to India in the middle of January; they are all now lodged in jails in the various Provinces, the majority in Bengal. The third category comprises all terrorist prisoners at present in jail and includes the repatriated convicts ; this is an all-India problem, and the situation in each Province will be described below. A hunger-strike, which has recently been started in several Provinces almost simultaneously, will be described separately in paragraph 68.61. Assam. The few repatriated Andamans convicts who are in jail in this Province demanded better treatment and threatened hunger-strike in case of refusal; they were allowed the benefits of &quot; B &quot; class treatment in October last.62. Bengal. Agitation for the release of the several hundred detenus in camps in Bengal had been in progress for some time before Gandhi decided to ask for an interview with the Governor in November. After this interview, which took-place on 9th November, the Bengal Government issued a statement on 18th November stating that in view of the improved atmosphere and of gandhis assurance that he would do his best to create a non-violent atmosphere in the Province, they had decided to release 1,100 detenus subject only to the requirement that changes of address be communicated. They added that they proposed to take up the cases of the remaining 450 detenus in the near future ; Gandhi intended to interview them and if he succeeded in obtaining satisfactory assurances from them Govern-ment hoped to be able to release them also. The statement poiuted out that the success of this policy must depend on public co-operation in &quot; maintaining an atmosphere in which subversive movements will find no encouragement.&quot;This statement had a mixed reception ; Gandhi took exception to the phrase &quot;subversive movements,&quot; and held to the formula that a released detenu would not take part in &quot; secret conspiracies or movements other than those openly sanctioned by Congress,&quot; to which the Home Minister agreed. The Press apparently expected more than Government were prepared to give and complained that the cases of the other 4p0 detenus had not been considered and that terrorist prisoners in jail were not mentioned. The Home Minister yielded no ground. Gandhi fell ill shortly afterwards and his task of interviewing the remaining detenus had not yet been commenced ; the Home Minister does not approve of the suggestion that Sarat Bose should be allowed to deputise for him, as assurances given to Bose would be even less credible than those given to Gandhi. At the end of January the ministry^ decided to proceed with progressive relaxation of restrictions on the remaining detenus without waiting for a visit from Gandhi.
The Ministry&apos;s policy regarding other terrorist prisoners is to stand firm against any demand for release ; a few sick convicts and a few whose sentences had almost expired have recently been released.The history of those detenus who have been released is interesting. Government considered the problem of finding them suitable employment and decided to give them allowances of Rs. 15 per mensem where necessary. The commercial com-munity of Bengal were asked to employ them if they could, and a &quot;certain number have obtained, jobs, but they are said to be thoroughly dissatisfied with then-position and craving the comforts they received while in detention. Reports indicate that, though efforts have been made to enrol them in Communist or revolutionary organisations, there is little danger of their taking to terrorism. On the other hand their leaders who are still detained are more dangerous, and there is little likelihood that they have abandoned their terrorist outlook.63. Bihar. The Premier&apos;s policy on the subject of releasing terrorist prisoners appears to be ill-defined and dictated by fear of criticism. At the beginning of December his attitude stiffened and he was in favour of a general release without discrimination ; but he was persuaded to examine individual cases, and after the release of two sick convicts in December he let the matter drop. In the middle of January a hunger-strike began, and the Premier was strongly in favour of releasing the prisoners if the hunger-strike was called off. At the end of January he was still pressing the Governor for permission to do so. The hunger-strike, still in progress at the end of the month, is described below.64. Bombay. At the end of December the Ministry put forward a proposal to release a dangerous terrorist, Sadashiv Malkapurka, who was convicted for complicity in a bomb case, on the ground that he had abjured violence and served two-thirds of a long sentence. The motive underlying the proposal is in part a desire to forestall&apos; left-wing criticism of the dilatoriness of the Bombay Government. The proposal is unwelcome because Malkapurka is a resident of the United Provinces and is likely to return there, where released convicts&apos; activities have been particularly objectionable.   No decision had been reached at the end of January.65. Madras. No serious problem has arisen; two sick convicts were released in December.- 66. Punjab. The hunger-strike, affecting three Provinces, originated here ; it is described below.67. United Provinces. The objectionable activities of released prisoners in this Province (described in paragraph 57) had the effect of slowing down the Premiers proposals for further releases. During the last three months no releases have been made, and it is only very recently that the Premier has returned to the charge.There are no terrorist prisoners in the Central Provinces, the North-West Frontier Province, Orissa or Sind.68. The Ranger-strike. On 20th November a notorious terrorist who had been repatriated from the Andamans and was lodged in Mullan jail (Punjab) and one other convict in the same jail started a hunger-strike to secure the unconditional release of all &quot; political&quot; prisoners. No difficulty was experienced in feeding them and the matter attracted no attention. In the middle of December certain terrorists in jail in Lahore announced their intention of starting a hunger-strike on 10th January to coincide with the opening of the session of the Assembly if they were not released. A Political Prisoners&apos; Release Society has been formed with the object of rousing public opinion against the continued incarceration of political prisoners; Gandhi asked the would-be hunger-strikers to refrain, and public opinion all over India is believed to be against this form of attempted blackmail. However, on 10th January the convicts began the strike, and since that date nine more have followed suit. There was little public interest evinced until 24th January, when the Release Committee organised a meeting and procession of some 20,000 persons who tried to stage a demonstration at the Assembly Hall in Lahore and had to be controlled by the police, who were subjected to much abuse and a shower of brickbats. The Government show no sign of yielding to the demands of the prisoners.On 17th January eight &quot; political &quot; prisoners started a hunger-strike in Bihar and the number has now risen to 14. The Premier is so much in fear of criticism that he is inclined to give an assurance that their cases will be considered, a
proposal which the Governor is strongly discouraging, not only because of the undesirable effect of yielding in the smallest degree to hunger-strikers, but also because of the reactions any. concession will have in other Provinces. The Premier has spoken indefinitely of resigning, but it is considered that even the resignation of the Ministry should not be allowed to alter the policy adopted towards hunger-strikers. ^ ,The third hunger-strike commenced in Dacca Jail (Bengal) on 25th January, the second day of the session of the Assembly. Nine terrorists struck, one of whom has since died. The Home Minister is prepared to take a firm stand, but has agreed to allow Sarat Bose to interview other terrorist prisoners in Ahpore Jail to prevent them also starting a strike, on condition that Sarat Bose publicly states that there is no question of his negotiating on behalf of Government.It is probable that these hunger-strikes are all part of a pre-concerted plan to attempt to force Governments hand. Action taken by one Government must have immediate reactions in other Provinces, so that the situation requires careful watching and control. All the hunger-strikes were continuing at the end of January and no concessions have been made.(/) The Agrarian Situation. :69. The agrarian trouble which was brewing iu Bihar and the United Provinces at the end of October increased in those Provinces and spread in a minor form to. other Provinces. Madras, the North-West Frontier, the Punjab and Sind have escaped, and agitation for tenancy reform in Bombay and the Central Provinces has been confined to mammoth demonstrations of peasants outside the Assembly Halls during the sessions of the Legislature, which dispersed quietly after their respective Premiers had made sympathetic addresses. In Assam a January report stated that the progress of revenue collection was causing anxiety, as an impression had sprung up that Government will be disinclined to take any strong action against defaulters in view of the new order of things existing in India. In Bengal sporadic efforts to start a no-rent campaign were reported in December and the Revenue Minister was apprehensive of the effect on tenants of the general anti-Government propaganda, A circular was issued to explain the benefits accruing from the new Tenancy Bill. In January a few cases of crop-looting and tenants&apos; agitation were reported, but there is not yet any widespread trouble.70. In Orissa agitation was conducted amongst tenants in December, when the Government issued a communique pointing out that they were proceeding with legislation to benefit the peasants and that they would not countenance any propaganda directed against the payment of legal clues by tenants to landlords. The agitation in this Province has been fairly intensive, but has led to no cases of violence ; there have been indications that landlords intend to oppose any agrarian legislation adversely affecting their interests.71. In Bihar the agrarian problem has been a continuous cause of grave anxiety during the past three months. In November the strained relations existing between zamindars and tenants were giving rise to agitation and lawlessness, the Kisans trying to force their demands for relief on the Government by violent methods. The Congress Ministry, while feeling sympathy with the landlords, were anxious to keep the Kisans quiet and were considering legislation to benefit the Kisans at the expense of the landlords, whose reaction was an allegation that Government were yielding to the Kisan&apos;s demands to a dangerous extent. A notorious Kisan agitator, who was also a member of the Provincial Congress Committee, Swami Sahajanand, led the agitation on behalf of the tenants, and they were led to hope that all arrears of rent would be cancelled. At the end of November a big Kisan rally in Patna, with Sahajanand as the moving spirit, openly accused the Ministry of doing nothing to help them. In this month the Ministry ordered that the speeches of certain dangerous Kisan agitators should be fully reported.By December the agitation had reached such a pitch that the local Congress leaders took alarm, and it was their action which has done much to keep the situation under control. While the police and the magistrates were taking all the necessary steps to ensure that the peace was kept as far as they could, the Congress Party condemned the spirit behind the agitation and withdrew the support of Congress workers from the Kisan movement. Sahajanand was indulging in wild speeches directed against the Ministry, and the results of his propaganda were
often seen in acts of lawlessness on the part of the Kisaus. The local Congress committees of two districts therefore warned their workers not to participate in his activities and advised Sahajanand to cancel his proposed tour in their areas. It is said that two prominent Congress leaders, A^allabhai Patel and Rajendra Prasad, had a conference with the Premier of Bihar, the result of which was that the Provincial Congress Committee endorsed the action taken in theftwo districts and adopted a resolution condemning the propaganda and directing Congressmen to-keep aloof from Kisan activities. This led to a complete breach between Congress and the Kisans ; Sahajanand resigned from the Provincial Committee after endeavouring in vain to defend his actions, and the All-India Congress Working-Committee endorsed the Provincial Committee&apos;s action at their meeting in January, in accordance with the principle that open violence is against the Congress creed and cannot be tolerated. Meanwhile, in December, there was serious unrest in G-aya district, where extra police had to be sent and proceedings were taken against 25 Kisan leaders ; in Patna and Monghyr murders were committed shortly after inflammatory agitation by Kisan speakers.Thanks to stern measures by district officers and police and to the Congress decision, much support has now been withdrawn from the more violent form of agitation, the difficult period of the rice harvest has passed, and the situation is easier.72. The problem in the United Provinces has been chiefly confined to difficulties in persuading tenants that the moratorium announced by Government did not mean that current rents need not be paid. Communists and released convicts did their best to stir up trouble by inciting tenants against their landlords, and extremist Congress . workers joined in the agitation. The Executive Committee of the provincial Kisan organisation includes two Communists, one released terrorist, and several Congress Socialists, an impressive body of left-wing workers. The collection of rents was progressing so slowly as a result of the propaganda being spread that the Ministry eventually woke up to the realisation that steps must be taken ; towards the end of December they issued a strongly-worded communique pointing out the meaning of the moratorium and explaining that current rents must be paid. Members of Government toured the Province appealing to tenants to pay up, and the Revenue Minister stated publicly that if tenants did not pay their rents Government would either have to adopt coercive measures or resign. The effect of widespread pro-Government propaganda has apparently been salutary, and tenants are alleged to be realising slowly the unpalatable truth that current rents have to be paid.(g) Communism.73. The month of November saw the widespread success of Communists&apos; subversive activities, particularly in Bombay Presidency and the United Provinces, where their hold over Labour led to serious trouble which brought home to all responsible leaders in the country the fact that the Communist challenge repre-sented a menace which Provincial Governments could not afford to ignore. Labour disturbances in these two Provinces are described in paragraphs 78-79. The Bombay Ministry tackled the menace boldly with the moral support of Vallabbai Patel and the Congress Party ; though Nehru had pressed the Ministers to relax restrictions on Communist leaders and repeal the only remaining effective law to deal with strikes, the Premier and the Home Minister resolutely opposed him, and the events of November vindicated their policy and impressed upon them more deeply a genuine fear of Communism. Since November, Bombay Communists have been lying low, having discovered that the opposition to their activities was sterner than they expected ; this apparent inactivity, together with a recent declaration of their sympathy with the Congress Ministry (probably a tactical move), has had the effect of lulling the Ministry into a security which may prove to be false.*74. Although Communists direct their strongest efforts to causing disturbances in the labour field, they are always ready to convert any form of discontent into a revolu-tionary movement: a case in point is the Sholapur trouble, which has already been described. (See paragraph 56.) They have also been in close communication with released terrorists and Kisan agitators, and their latest move is to endeavour to infect the police force in Bengal with the germ of disaffection by publishing a pamphlet outlining the pitiful conditions of constables and inviting them to form unions for the redress of their grievances.
There is a close connection between the extremist section of the Congress Party and the Communists ; Communist leaders have made outspoken attacks on the conservative attitude of the right wing towards Jaw and order. Nehru has been in a position of some difficulty as his well-known sympathies with Communism have been subdued by the control of Gandhi and the right element in the Working Committee of which Nehru is President. The ultimate aim of the Communist Party is the overthrow of all Imperialist and capitalist elements, which of course includes the expulsion of the British from India, by means of revolution. &quot; Russian Revolution Day &quot; was celebrated in Bombay and Calcutta on 7th November.75. Since the relaxation of Press restrictions in Congress Provinces, Communists have been able to recommence the publication of their newspapers, marry of which had been forced to suspend publication owing to the strict measures taken against them. Several papers have reappeared in the United Provinces ; in Madras an organ of the Party has been published called the New Age, which frankly reflects extreme Communist opinion; in Bombay a new English weekly entitled The National Front is expected to issue in February to coincide writh the next session of the All-India Congress Committee.(7i) The Labour Situation.76. The efforts of Communists in India have been directed primarily towards the creation and fostering of trouble among labour. Bombay and Calcutta are their main centres, but they have spread far and wide through Bombay Presidency and into the United Provinces, and it is not unlikely that they were responsible for a short strike in Coimbatore (in Madras Presidency) in November, which involved some 12,000 workers in mills, and was settled by the intervention of Government. There has been no trouble in any other Provinces except Bengal, Bombay and the United Provinces, which will be considered separately.77. Bengal. In November Communists were active in stirring up discontent among dock-workers and later on in the jute mills, but their efforts were unsuccessful. In December the Negotiations Committee, which had been set up to try to settle the problems connected with the threatened strike of workers in the Electric Supply Corporation, was inclined to think that no solution could be found, and its failure made the workers restive again. They talked of sabotage in the event of a strike, and a Communist member of the Legislature encouraged them to &quot; down tools.&quot; In January the Committee succeeded in getting the parties to agree to some form of provisional settlement, and for the present the threat of a strike has been averted.78. Bombay. In November, when the threat of a general strike in Bombay city was very real, the Home Minister set up a Committee to arrange for carrying on the essential services during a strike and was considering ways and means of augmenting the police force.A Textile Enquiry Committee has been deliberating for several months, and it seems probable that Communists are awaiting its verdict before deciding whether to call workers to strike ; the Ministry have directed all their efforts to prevent one, and these efforts, coupled with lack of funds and general Congress opposition, have given, a temporary check to Communist designs in Bombay city. - Recently the Communists have made a declaration of their loyalty to Congress and intended co-operation with the Ministry; it is difficult to see how they reconcile this with their avowed intentions, but the Ministry appear to be so well satisfied of their good faith that they speak of repealing the Emergency Powers Act, which is their chief weapon against a strike.The most serious trouble occurred in Ahmedabad, where a large number of textile mills employ many thousands of workers. In 1935 financial stringency led the millowners to impose a wage-cut which increasing prosperity has now rendered unjustifiable. As soon as agitation for the abolition of the cut began Communists took charge. A strike began on 6th November, and in a short time 37 mills were affected, involving some 3D,000 men,- with Communist agitators hampering all negotiations. The Ministry received a severe shock, and took firm measures to prevent disorder. Extra police were drafted to the city, and restrictive orders were issued without delay. Vallabhai Patel came out openly against the Communists and the whole weight of the Congress Party was thrown into the struggle. By December the rnillowners and Communists were persuaded to enter into negotiations
and when the wage-cut was eventually abolished the strike came to an end. These affairs in Ahmedabad had the salutary effect of demonstrating yet again to the Ministry the dangers of Communism and also the value of the police.In January Communists engineered a strike among agricultural labourers on a farm in Ahmednagar district; the strike was short-lived and peaceful, but is worth mentioning liecause the district is normally backward and quiet and without Communist interference there would never have been any suggestion of agricultural labour unrest; a79. United Provinces. During most of November the situation in Cawnpore was quiet and practically all mills were working, though unrest was not far below the surface. At the end of November a loyal Muslim overseer of the Elgin Mills was suddenly murdered, there being indications that he was the victim of vindictive strikers. The District Magistrate of Cawnpore took immediate steps to prevent an outbreak which might easily have developed into a communal riot as Muslim feeling was running high against the Hindu Congressmen. Orders prohibiting speeches and publication of pamphlets were served on 16 Communist leaders ; security proceedings were taken against the Secretary of the Labourers&apos; Union, and a number of arrests were made on suspicion in connection with the murder. The Premier was actually present in Cawnpore at the time of the murder; he was not, however, consulted about the issue of orders, though he was informed of them, and later at a meeting of the Congress Party of the Legislature he accepted full responsibility for the measures adopted. Undoubtedly they prevented the threat of a grave disturbance.The situation in Cawnpore is now quiet and the restrictive orders have been to some extent relaxed.(i) Terrorism.80. Although there have been no active manifestations of terrorism in India for some time, it cannot be said that the cult is dead. Believers in non-violence are apt to be unduly optimistic in their trust, that a terrorist prisoner who gives an assurance that he has abandoned terrorism immediately becomes a reformed character. The activities of released terrorists go a long way to show that their mentality has undergone little change in jail, and that if and when the time is ripe they are ready to forget their promises and revert to revolutionary practices. Speeches made by ex-Kakori convicts in the United Provinces have contained many references to bloodshed as being a necessary preliminary to the ejection of the British from India. There is reason to believe that Gandhi was astonished at the mentality of violence permeating the ranks of Bengal terrorists, many of whom are said to have congratulated themselves on evading the issue when Gandhi asked for assurances that they had abandoned the cult of violence. Abjuring terrorism did not necessarily mean abjuring violence, and might be compatible with abandoning isolated attacks in favour of the more fashionable cult of violent revolution. At the same time there is no reason to suppose that a number of less determined terrorists may not be genuinely impressed by the earnest appeals which Gandhi has made for a change of heart.(?) Communal Trouble.81. There have been few outbreaks of communal trouble during the period under review, though tension between the communities has been reported periodically from several districts in the Central Provinces and the Punjab. A small Hindu-Muslim affray occurred in a Bihar village in December resulting in some 20 injuries. Two Hindu-Muslim riots took place in the United Provinces; early in November at Aligarh a Muslim protest against music being played a3 a procession passed a mosque led to a disturbance in-which one man was killed and 65 were injured. At Dadir fair in December Hindus attacked local butchers to prevent them slaughtering cows, and one butcher was killed and some 40 persons injured, including eight policemen. An enquiry is being conducted into the November riots in Jubbulpore in the Central Provinces.Two Congress Ministries have taken steps to minimise the danger of communal disturbances. A circular was issued in the Central Provinces to all District Magistrates in December, allowing full and accurate reports to be made of speeches likely to increase communal tension, and informing officers that they could rely on Governments support in any measures which they had to take to keep the peace.
27182The United Provinces Government also sent a circular to District Magistrates in November which, while imputing to Government servants a failure to observe an impartial attitude in communal matters, enjoined on district officers the necessity for immediate action to check communal trouble. Relations between Congress and Muslims will be discussed in paragraph 91.VI.-POLITICAL MOVEMENTS.(a) The Congress Party.82. Attitude to &quot; Repression.&quot; An interesting feature of the past three months has been the crystallising of the Congress leaders&apos; attitude towards violence and the advocacy of violence. When Rajagopalachari ordered a prosecution for sedition in Madras in October he started a controversy which on the theoretical side is between those who uphold the Ganclhian doctrine of non-violence and those who maintain that &quot;civil liberty&quot; requires that the individual is entitled to say what he likes with impunity; and on the practical side ranges the Congressmen responsible for administration against those who desire no restriction on agitation. At the end of October Gandhi wrote : &quot; Civil liberty is not criminal liberty ... it means full liberty to say and do what one likes within the ordinary law of the land. It has been suggested that Congress Ministers who are pledged to non-violence cannot resort to legal processes involving punishment. Such is not my view of non-violence accepted by Congress. They cannot ignore incitement to violence and manifestly violent speeches.&quot; When the action of the Madras Ministry came up for review at the Working Committee meeting at Calcutta in the last days of October, it is said that Nehru was very critical of the Madras Premier&apos;s policy, but that Gandhi and the right-wing members overruled him and persuaded the Committee to endorse the action taken. When the All-India Congress Committee met a few days later, Nehru stood by this decision; and during a discussion on a resolution raised by the left wing &quot; viewing with apprehension the action taken under section .124-A,&quot; he argued that though all Congressmen were seditionists and would continue to be so, they had to draw a line of demarcation on the question of violence ; and that, though it was the duty of Congress Ministries to try the method of persuasion first, it could not be said that they should not prosecute in a case where violence was involved. . In a long statement on the subject, Nehru remarked that &quot;if a person clearly incites people to violence, he must be prosecuted and it is the duty of those who are sincere about non-violence to support such a Ministry.&quot;This controversy gained importance and publicity from subsequent events in various Provinces violent speaking by released prisoners in the United Provinces, by Kisan agitators in Bihar, and by Communists in Bombay Presidency. These have all been described in the course of this survey. Congress leaders have made a series of statements more or less on the lines of Gandhi&apos;s article quoted above, one of the most definite being that of Satyamurti, deputy leader of the Congress Party in the Central Assembly, that &quot; even under the Congress regime if individuals preach violence, violence ought to be naturally met with violence.&quot;Nehru reiterated his previous statement when asked for his opinion as to the prosecution of Parmanand in the United Provinces ; the breach between Congress and the Kisans in Bihar has been described; the unrest at Ahmedabad and Oawnpore called forth a strong article from Gandhi about the uncertain control of Congress over forces of disorder. &quot;In my opinion,&quot; he wrote, &quot;if forces of disorder cannot be controlled without the police and the military, acceptance of office loses all force and meaning and the sooner the Ministries are withdrawn the better.&quot;83. At present the right wing still has the Working Committee Under control, thanks largely to Gandhi&apos;s dominating influence. It is believed that when the Committee pet again in Bombay at the beginning of January, Nehru was jplanning to pass a resolution condemning the repressive action of Congress Ministries; Gandhi was too ill to attend, but he summoned Rajagopalachari from Madras to champion the right-wing cause, which he did so vehemently that he silenced the opposition, and the resolution which was passed said that it was necessary &quot; to adhere to the Congress policj7 of non-violence and discourage all incitement to violence. Congress Ministries must guide themselves by the principles of civil liberty and democratic approach by means of persuasion rather than coercive action, but . , .
coercive action may become necessary, and in such cases Ministries inevitably will have to undertake it.&quot; The resolution also condemned the activities of the Kisans, with which, it said, Congress could not associate itself.84. Subhas Bose, the newly-elected President of Congress, has pronounced left-wing ideas ami is more of an extremist than Nehru ; Rajagopalachari has privately expressed the view that the election of Bose is a great mistake, but he is confident that the right wing in the Working Committee will be able to control Bose&apos;s left wing activities and guide him in the direction they desire. An indication of the respective strengths of the right and left is provided by the recent elections to the All-India Congress meeting to be held in February ; the right wing has gained ground and the majority of left groups have been heavily defeated by Gandhi&apos;s disciples, in most parts of the country.85. President of the Congress. Subhas Chandra Bose, the newly-elected President of the party, is a Bengali of about 40 years of age. After being expelled from his college in Calcutta in 1916 in connection with an assault on a professor he successfully competed in the Indian Civil Service examination in England in 1919, but he threw up his appointment in sympathy with the non-co-operation movement. While in Europe he was closely identified with Indian revolutionaries both in England and in Germany, and on his return to India he plunged into revolutionary politics and in October 1924 was arrested and confined as a State prisoner for his connection with the terrorist movement in Bengal. On his release in May 1927 he resumed his political activities and in January 1930 was sentenced to one year&apos;s imprisonment for sedition. Again on release he recommenced his revolutionary activities and in 1932 he was considered so dangerous that he was again interned as a State prisoner. During his internment he devoted his time to the preparation of a militant revolu-tionaryprogramme. In 1933 he was released on the ground of ill-health and was allowed to proceed to Europe. In the winter of 1935-36 he paid a flying visit to India, during which he was subjected to restraint, and when he returned to India again in April 1936 he was once more interned as a State prisoner as his activities abroad had shown him to be a ruthless and dangerous revolutionary. In March 1937 he was finally released from restraint, and, ostensibly to recuperate his health, he visited Europe again in November 1937 and after paying a brief visit to England returned to India in January 1938.Subhas Bose is first and foremost a Bengali. All his sympathies are towards the left, although he has given an undertaking to Gandhi that he has renounced all belief in the doctrine of violence as a revolutionary method. He is regarded generally as a weak character and his personality is unimpressive. The main reason for his election as President is probably the desire to strengthen the Congress position in Bengal ; but he could not have been chosen without the approval of Gandhi, and it is believed that Gandhi wanted a young man for the position and is confident of his own power over Bose to prevent him from leading the Congress Party in the direction which is most obnoxious to the majority of the Working Committee.86. Attitude to Federation. The All-India Committee passed a resolution at Calcutta in November reiterating their &quot;emphatic condemnation and complete opposition to the scheme &quot; and their decision to combat it in every way open to them. There is reason to think that no detailed plans for combating it were then drawn up, and that the Working Committee accepted the view that the resignation of Ministries on this issue would be fruitless. The general opinion, was that the only effective method of preventing Federation was to compel Governors to suspend the Constitution, which is a policy favoured by no one as the Congress Ministries have not had time to implement their election promises. At the end of January there was still no clear indication that Congress would uncompromisingly fight the Federal scheme, though they would certainly not accept some features of it, and thev numerous resolutions in condemnation of the scheme passed unanimously in Congress Legislatures under instructions issued by the Working Committee maintained the attitude of theoretical opposition. :87. Congress has expressed its antagonism to the awarding of honours and titles in any form by a resolution at the All-India Committee in Calcutta and similar resolutions in various Provincial Assemblies.88. Attitude to Minorities. The Committee attempted to placate Muslim opposition by repeating that the Congress policy was to protect minorities&apos; rights ;
i&apos;9133Nehru made a statement in January that Congress was prepared to go beyond justice to the minorities in order to inspire confidence. There still appears to be little likelihood of a Muslim Congress rapprochement. The relations existing between the communities are discussed in paragraph 81. Another attempt to disarm criticism of the predominantly Hindu complexion of Congress was the adoption by the Working Committee of a recommendation that only the first two inoffensive stanzas of the song &quot; Bande Mataram &quot; should be sung.89. Attitude to States. Another cause of friction between Gandhi and the left wing was the passing of a resolution at Calcutta condemning the repressive policy of the Mysore State Government for taking restrictive action against a Congress agitator, and appealing to the people of British India to help the people of Mysore. The policy of Congress has in recent times been to refrain from any interference in the States, a policy dictated by Gandhi some years ago. This new resolution was against established policy and was moved and passed by left-wing tactics before the right wing fully realised what was happening. Gandhi afterwards described the resolution as &quot; offensive &quot; ; its effect has been negligible.90. &quot; Independence.&quot; A new &quot; independence pledge &quot; has been recently published, containing most of the objectionable features of the previous one, which was banned in most of the Provinces before the advent of Provincial Autonomy. The ban on the old pledge has been removed on the advice of the Central Government because with Congress representing the Government in seven Provinces the proscription of the pledge was considered to be anomalous.91. Gandhis health has given cause for anxiety since the beginning of November, when he broke down after the strain of the Working Committee meeting and his negotiations&apos; with the Bengal Government for the release of detenus. He has taken no overt part in politics and could not attend the meeting of the Working Committee at Bombay, though he was easily accessible at a neighbouring seaside resort. He has now returned home to Wardha in the Central Provinces, where the Working Committee will meet in February. Jawaharlal Nehru toured Assam at the end of November but created little impression and found that subscriptions to the Congress funds were disappointing; he has recently been touring the North-West Frontier Province. It is well known that his sympathies are to the left, and he is said to have announced his intention of concentrating on that wing after he lays down the office of President in February.(b) The Muslim League.92. Since the important conference at Lucknow in October, the League has been gaining strength, and the Congress Party&apos;s conciliatory attitude to Muslims indicates that they realise the danger of the League becoming an effective counter-organisation. In spite of attempted approaches the League and Congress remain mutually suspicious and hostile, and Jinnah, the League President, in recent utterances has been as strongly denunciatory of Congress as ever.The Lucknow Conference undoubtedly reawakened a dying enthusiasm. A Congress success in a League versus Congress struggle for a bye-election in Bijnor (United Provinces) intensified the activity of the rival parties and the League&apos;s reviving influence was demonstrated by their candidates winning three subsequent bye-elections contested by Congress. The League&apos;s organisation has been extended and its membership increased ; of about 174 new branches formed since the conference 90 belong to the United Provinces and 40 to the Punjab, while all the Northern Provinces claim a certain number. A lakh of new members are said to have been enrolled in the United Provinces alone.Congress made a half-hearted attempt to keep the Muslim community quiet by means of the Working Committee&apos;s Calcutta resolution, which repeated the Congress Party&apos;s determination to see that justice was done to minorities, but they did not succeed in lulling their suspicions, largely because the Congress practice of &quot; mass contacts &quot; continued unabated. It soon became clear that this policy had miscarried, and Congress leaders decided that an effort must be made to conciliate Muslim sentiment by negotiation. To this end Nehru issued a statement from Bombay in January which was intended to pave the Avay to further negotiations, but Jinnah&apos;s reply was not encouraging and expressed a doubt as to the sincerity of Congress and its ability to give adequate assurances of safeguards to minorities.
Although it is questionable if Jinnah has the personality required for the leader of a League uniting the Muslims of all-India, he is greeted everywhere with great enthusiasm by Muslims, who realise that he is actively trying to bind their forces together and is the spokesman of their dislike and distrust of the Hindu Congress Party. Jinnah, however, has little influence in the predominantly Muslim Punjab, though any suggestion of &quot; flirting &quot; with Congress is in that Province viewed with the gravest misgivings.(c) Other Opposition to Congress.93. Anti-Congress opinion in the Congress Provinces remains unorganised and ineffective. The land-owning interests, though nervous, have failed to act. as an opposition of weight, and there are still no signs of any other conservative interests causing concern to Congress. In Madras, for instance, the once-powerful Justice Party is sunk in dejection and personal rivalries. It does not appear likely that in any Congress Province the dominance of the party will meet with any serious challenge from the right till vested interests are sufficiently alarmed to make a fight.VIL-SPECIAL PROBLEMS, (a) Palestine.94. The original outburst of indignation with which Muslims in India greeted the recommendations of the Royal Commission has led to no important results and has to a great extent subsided ; agitation from time to time in the Press and statements by Muslim leaders criticising the policy of the British Government are now the only indications of any interest in the subject. Muslims resent the recommendations as likely to harm the cause of their brethren in Palestine, and the Congress Party have taken this opportunity to protest against one more demonstration of Imperialistic repression and at the same time to woo Muslim feeling by assuring that community of the Congress Party&apos;s sympathy. A resolution passed by the Working Committee at Calcutta in November protested against &quot;the reign of terror that is being established in Palestine by British Imperialism,&quot; and assured the Arabs of the &quot; solidarity of the Indian people with them in their struggle for national freedom.&quot; A &quot;Palestine Council of Action&quot; held a meeting in the Punjab on 20th December, at which only five members out of 21 were present; it was decided that agitation would embarrass Congress Ministries and should, therefore, be confined to Delhi and the - Punjab until Congress were prepared to co-operate. Nothing has been done to put this policy into practice.(b) &quot;Prohibition.&quot;95. It is too early to judge whether prohibition is a successful experiment in Madras. The Premier, who was responsible for the measure, professes to be satisfied with the results, but reports in the Press suggest that illicit distillation is increasing and that the cost of enforcement is high. Local officers are com-paratively optimistic but have not yet committed themselves to a definite opinion. &quot; Prohibition &quot; has been introduced in only one other Province so far, the Central Provinces, where two industrial areas were declared &quot; dry &quot; on 1st January. It has attracted little attention, and the Prohibition Bill has not yet become law under the terms of which Government will enforce it in Saugor district, and will have powers to extend the Act elsewhere. Europeans have been exempted from the provisions of the Bill by the special request of the Governor.The Assam Government are considering a scheme of total &quot;prohibition&quot; in the district of Dhubri; the Bengal Ministry intend to introduce it in Noakhali district from 1st April; this district is said to return an insignificant excise revenue. The Bihar Ministry are contemplating a Bill to enforce &quot; prohibition&quot; in certain industrial areas, and the North-West Frontier Ministry propose to introduce it in Dera Ismail Khan district during the next financial year. The Orissa Govern-ment are said to be considering the introduction of &quot;prohibition&quot; in a district which is largely populated by hard-drinking aboriginals where prospects of success are remote.The Punjab and Sind are not yet contemplating it. The Government of the United Provinces put forward a comprehensive scheme in December, involving a loss of at least 32 lakhs, but budget considerations watered, down their proposals
31184and they now intend to make a start in two districts only, Etah and Mainpuri. All these measures are intended to be experimental only in the first place, and further extensions will depend on their success.(c) Gujarat Lands (Bombay).96. Although the immediate problem of the confiscated lands in G*ujarat was temporarily settled by a compromise in October, the difficulties are by no means over, owing largely to the unreasonable and vindictive attitude adopted by Morarji Desai, the Revenue Minister. In accordance with the solution reached, twro Commissioners have been negotiating with the owners of the lands ; about half the owners are prepared to part with their holdings at a fair price and might be ready to accept half the price they actually demand, which is the most that the Ministry are likely to offer. There are, however, a number of owners who are refusing to give up their land on any condition.One of the greatest difficulties with which the Commissioners have to contend is the. position taken up by the Revenue Minister, who is determined that the lands shall be restored to their original owners, even if he has to enforce it by legislation, and at the same time proposes to offer quite inadequate prices to the present owners. Behind the Minister stands Vallabhai Patel, whose determination is equally firm. It is true that many owners are demanding fantastic prices, but the prices offered by the Ministry are equally unreasonable. Desai&apos;s motive is partly, at any rate, a desire to mete out retribution to the &quot; unpatriotic &quot; owners who purchased the lands when they were forfeited by offenders in the civil disobedience movement. Patel has been trying to force certain reluctant owners to sell by the subtle method of threatening to release the Dublas a class of labourers on whom landowners rely largely for their agricultural work from the economic serfdom in which they are bound, thereby depriving owners of their labour and forcing them to sell or leave their lands uncultivated.These are the difficulties with which the Commissioners are contending, while their sole aim is, without breaking the pledge given in 1931 that the buyers should never be required to surrender the lands, to secure a reasonable price for them. The proposed figures have recently been reported to Government, who are con-sidering them, but it is considered unlikely that a final settlement will be reached for some time to come.(d) The Congress Flag and &quot;Bande Mataram.&quot;97. While the Congress Party continue to claim that their flag is the national emblem,&apos;Muslims refuse to recognise it as such. There have been no attempts to eliminate the Union Jack in its favour, and very few incidents connected with it. The Governments of Madras and Sind have issued instructions permitting the flying of the Congress flag on local board buildings, with the proviso that it shall not be flown at the same time as the Union Jack. The Governor of the United Provinces was confronted with an awkward situation when, having agreed to preside over the Jubilee Celebrations of the Allahabad University, he learnt that certain extreme elements in the University insisted on flying the Congress flag; fortunately, wiser counsels prevailed, and the Governor had a reassuring reception.98. The Congress Working Committee adopted a resolution at Calcutta in November that only the first two stanzas of the song &quot; Bande Mataram&quot; should be sung in order that Muslim susceptibilities should not be offended, those stanzas being considered inoffensive. The recommendation has not been followed, and in some instances Muslims have walked out of the Legislative bodies as a protest against the singing of the song before the opening of proceedings. The Working Committee also appointed a sub-committee to examine all current national songs and to submit for consideration those which were worthy to fiud a place in a collection of national songs. This resolution was not discussed by the All-India Committee, and nothing more has been heard of it. &apos; Muslims continue to regard the song as yet another indication of the &quot;purely Hindu complexion and aspirations of Congress.(e) Speakers&apos; Conference.99. At the beginning of January the Speakers of Provincial Legislatures held an informal conference in New Delhi with Sir Abdur Rahim (President of the Central Assembly) presiding; proceedings were confidential and no decisions were
announced, but the conference is said to have been useful and instructive. One result has come to the notice of Government in the shape of a proposal to arm Speakers with greater powers than they enjoy under the Government of India Act ; the restriction imposed by subsection (3) of section 71 on the punitive and disciplinary powers of Speakers is regarded by them as giving them inadequate protection against irresponsible criticism outside the Legislatures.(/) Anti-War and Anti-Recruiting Propaganda.100. The Congress Party is firmly opposed to war of any kind on the principles that war is antagonistic to their belief in non-violence and a manifestation of Imperialistic aggression. Japan has been universally condemned for her attack on China, and comparisons have been drawn between the Imperialist designs of Japan and those of Great Britain. In accordance with these principles, Congress workers have been freely condemning war at public-meetings, announcing that in the event of a war in which Britain is involved they will give no assistance and discourage recruitment to the Army. There have been many instances of such propaganda, for the most part in the United Provinces and the Punjab (which provided the greater part of the Indian contingent during the Great War), but it is believed that little effect has been created, because those classes which have a tradition of army service are unimpressed, while the others need no encouragement to keep out of the way of the recruiting officer. It is not possible to check these activities of Congress workers, which are within the law, except by counter-propaganda. There have been no instances of direct interference with recruiting, and the flow of recruits is said to be continuing satisfactorily.There have been half-hearted attempts to extend the opposition of Congress to the elaboration of &quot; passive &quot; defence against air raids a subject which is under consideration by a Committee set up by the Governor-General and which is interesting vulnerable areas ; but the lessons of China and Spain are likely to have more effect than doctrinaire theory.VIII. THE CENTRAL LEGISLATURES.(a) The Council of State.101. A special session was held from 15th November to 25th November to consider the Insurance Bill as passed by the Central Assembly in October. After a number of amendments had been made, the Bill was passed on the last day of the session. The amended Bill will be considered by the Assembly at its budget session. An adjournment motion to discuss the Wheeler Report on the Reorganisation of the Government of India Secretariat was talked out.(6) The Central Assembly. 102. The Assembly began its budget session on 31st January.7143      Wt 8043/RDP 4   85   4.38   (Conf. 47)
