238Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1938.Copy No.   40CABINET.CONVERSATIONS WITH Mr. de VALERA.SECRET. CP. 108 (38).Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.MY innumerable conversations with Mr. de Valera during his recent visits to London were taken up almost entirely with the matter of the Agreements which have since been concluded and signed. I need not trouble my colleagues with any account of these. But I think it is worth recording (as an indication of Mr. de Valera&apos;s mind) that, in addition, I took various opportunities to make the point that, if agreement were reached, and Eire therefore received in full the benefits (such as Imperial preference) of membership of the British Common-wealth, of Nations, we on our side would expect that the Dominion was ready to recognise the obligations as well as the benefits of membership. I said that I hoped that Mr. de Valera himself would, as time went on, place more and more emphasis in speeches on his country &apos;s membership of the Commonwealth, and also that he and his colleagues would become less shy about making public acknowlegement-ment of the position of the King and the Crown in the Commonwealth.Mr. de Valera said that this would be possible, but that it would be a slow process. He would have to be very cautious about his expressions in this respect. His people would have to be educated up to a recognition of the situation, and their prejudice could only very slowly be removed.I said that I could appreciate the importance of this matter being handled discreetly for some time to come. But there would be occasions even in the comparatively near future when the Government of Eire would have to demon-strate definitely whether their country belonged to the Commonwealth or not. For instance, in the next three or four years there would no doubt be another Imperial Conference. I presumed that, if we could settle the matters at present under discussion between us, he and his colleagues would come to the Conference.Mr. de Valera said that they would certainly come.I then said that as he knew the first action of the Conference was the sending of a message of loyalty and greeting to His Majesty The King. We did not want any scenes at an Imperial&apos; Conference. Could I assume that he would support that message ?Mr. de Valera replied that he thought it would be impossible for him to be associated publicly with such a message whilst the Partition of Ireland continued. He would invite such criticism from some of his own supporters that a very unpleasant controversy would arise in Eire which would be damaging to the position of the Crown itself. He thought therefore that in those circum-stances he had better find some excuse for missing the opening session of the Conference.I asked him whether, if Partition did not exist, he would be able to support publicly a message of loyalty to the King. He answered at once : &quot; If we had a United Ireland my position would be exactly the same as that of General Hertzog.&quot; He went on to say that he could support messages of loyalty and join in drinking the toast of &quot; The King,&quot; and so on.M. M.Dominions Office, May 1, 1938.[17144]
