THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT     A printed for the Cabinet.   April 1938.SECRET. Copy No. 3 8CP. 88 (38)CABINET.SPAIN.Questions arising from the Refugee Problem in Spain. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT will be recalled that my predecessor was authorised by the Cabinet on the 22nd December last to inform the International Commission for the Assistance of Child Refugees in Spain that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to contribute  25,000 to that organisation, as soon as they were satisfied that the remainder of the sum necessary to support the scheme for giving assistance to child refugees in Spain and to maintain it for four months ( 147,000) would be available from other quarters, including preferably foreign Governments, and that the scheme would be administered on a genuinely international basis.Up to date the Commission have obtained promises from other Governments, which are mostly subject to the same conditions as those attached to the United Kingdom grant, which amount to a total of about  12,000, with prospects of a further  5,000 to  10,000. It is therefore clear that the Commission have no prospect of satisfying the conditions attached to the United Kingdom grant.At the same time, I am satisfied that the Commission have made a genuine effort to put their scheme on an international basis by obtaining conditional offers from eight Governments, including three Dominion Governments, with a prospect of grants from five others, and that a proportion of such sums as are available will be utilised for the relief of children on the Nationalist side, thus ensuring the impartial character of the scheme. I am also satisfied that the urgent need which led to the launching of the appeal still exists, and that the scheme continues to deserve the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Further, I am informed that the original proposal to feed a quarter of a million children for four months at a total cost of  147,000, was based on the Commission^ estimate of the maximum need in Spain, and that even if only a very much smaller amount were available, the Commission would nevertheless be able to put into immediate operation arrangements for the feeding, for a period of not less than a hundred days, of between 80,000 and 90,000 of those children who are in most immediate need of food.It is accordingly suggested that: (a) The original offer of His Majesty&apos;s Government should now be withdrawn. \b) In its place His Majesty&apos;s Government should offer to contribute  10,000, ^ on condition that an equivalent of this amount is available from elsewhere.(c) Over and above this amount His Majesty&apos;s Government should offer to contribute, up to a maximum of  10,000,  1,000 for every  2,000 collected elsewhere. This proposal, which provides that the British contribution shall in any case not exceed half the total of the contri-butions, is designed to encourage further contributions and to preserve as far as possible the international character of the scheme.9811   [16989]
sat  the same time it will be recalled that His Majesty&apos;s Government contri-buted last September  5,000 to the International Red Cross Society for the purpose of Spanish relief, and I have now received a report in which it is stated that the work ofj-he International Red Cross in Spain is likely to be severely restricted through lack of funds. This work does not conflict in any way with that of the International Commission for the Assistance of Child Refugees, as the International Red Cross confine themselves to the provision of medical relief, the visiting of prisons and the organisation of information and evacuation services. As His Majesty&apos;s Government are specially interested in the work of the International Red Cross in virtue of the fact that they are a signatory to the Geneva Convention, it is suggested that a renewed contribution of  5,000 should be made for the present year, subject, as before, to the condition that His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that a reasonable number of contributions are still being received from other Governments.The total amount which it is now suggested should be contributed to the International Commission for the Assistance of Child Refugees and to the International Red Cross, even provided that all the conditions required are -complied with, does not exceed the amount approved by the Cabinet on the 22nd December last.H.Foreign Office, April 2. 1938.
