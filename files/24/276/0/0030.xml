COPY   NO.   .       . . .105 .C A B -I N E  T.LEGISLATION AMENDING - MENTAL DEFICIENCY ACT,  1913. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH..1.     As a result of the Judgment of the Court of Appeal In the case of REX v. BOARD OF CONTROL Ex Parte WINT.5RFL00D,  a position of considerable legal and administrative difficulty has arisen which I am afraid can only be remedied by a short Amending Bill,  if my Colleagues will agree to its introduction.2.      The case arises on the interpretation of Section 11 of the Mental Deficiency Act,  1913:-(a) This Section provides that an Order for the detention of a defective shall,  in the first instance, be operative for one year.      The Board are empowered to make - and for the convenience of the local Visitors  (i.e.,- the visiting Justices) they have made - a General Order providing that, in the case of defectives sent to Institutions, these Orders shall expire on the Quarter Day next after the date on. which they would otherwise have expired.      Section 11 further provides that the Detention Order shall remain in force for one year after the date &quot;when it would have expired, and thereafter for successive periods of five years,  if at that date and at the end of each period of one and five years respectively the Board of Control,  after considering the Special Reports and Certificates prescribed by the Section, consider that the continuation of the Order is required and make an Order for the purpose. ...-  -
Ill(b) There are thus three processes involved: -The Board of Control must (i)  consider the Special Reports and Certificates;     (ii) satisfy themselves that the continuation of the Order is required;     (iii) make an Order for the purpose.      If the words &quot;at that date and at the end of each period&quot; are to be interpreted as meaning a moment of time - e .g., midnight of Quarter Day - it is manifestly impossible for all these processes to be performed at the given moment.     The Board of Control have proceeded on the view (based upon the advice of their Legal Adviser)  that the processes  (i)  and (ii)  should be completed by. Quarter Day, but that the sealing and issuing of the Order can be completed as soon as is administratively practicable thereafter.      (It should be explained that about 3,000 patients now have to be dealt with in each Quarter entailing a review of about 6,000 documents.)(c) A Rule Nisi was obtained against the Board of Control to show cause why awrit of Habeas Corpus should not be       -issued against them in respect of a defective named HORACE WINTEftFLOOD,  on the main ground that in 1931 the Order purporting to continue his detention from the24th June was in fact dated and sealed the 29th June and was, therefore invalid.      A Divisional Court of the High Court, consisting of The Lord Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Humphreys, and Mr. Justice du Parcq, upheld the Board&apos;s interpretation of Section 11 of the Mental Deficiency Act and discharged the Rule.v(d)  The Court of Appeal, however, consisting of Lord Justice Slesser, Lord Justice Clauson, and Mr. Justice Goddard, have reversed this Judgment, and decided that Orders of the Board continuing Detention Orders must under the Section be issued by Quarter Day.   . Lord Justice Slesser and Mr. Justice Goddard in their Judgments both
2S4alluded to the possibility of great admisistrative difficulties flowing from this Judgment and indicated that that would be a matter for the Legislature.3.      The Judgment of the Court of Appeal will have two results: -(a) It is anticipated that vVinterflood will now bring an Action for damages for wrongful detention.(b) The Judgment technically invalidates a very large proportion of the current Orders under which mental defectives are detained.      If Winterflood succeeds in obtaining damages,  it is certain that a number of other similar Actions will be brought.     Moreover,  in view of the decision as to the invalidity of Orders made after Quarter Day, the Managers of Institutions may be disposed to release defectives for whose detention they can argue there is no legal warrant, notwithstanding the fact that for the public safety it may be imperative that they should be detained under care.4.      To prevent this situation arising,  I would a3k my Colleagues to authorise the preparation of a short Bill which, I suggest, might conveniently be introduced in the Lords. This Bill would have a twofold purpose: -(a) It would amend Section 11 of the Mental Deficiency Act so as to simplify the procedure by bringing it into line with the procedure which has operated satisfactorily for the continuation of Detention Orders for persons dealt with under the Lunacy Act of 1890.     Under that procedure the receiptof adequate certificates has automatically the effect of continuing the Order for Detention without the necessity for the issuing of Continuation Orders by the Board.(b) Secondly,  the Bill would provide that, notwithstanding anything in Section 11 of the Mental Deficiency Act,  any
nistry of Health;April 28th, 1938.Order made by the Board of Control before the passing of the Bill should not be deemed to be invalid, by reason of the fact that it was made subsequently to Quarter. Day,, and should be&quot; deemed to have been mad.e on that &quot;day.5.      For the reasons which I have indicated, the matter is one of urgency, and,  if my Colleagues agree,  I would endeavour to have a Bill prepared for the consideration of the Home Affairs Committee at an early date.K .
