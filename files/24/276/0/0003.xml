Sub-Enclosure.THE French Government have recently, on a number of occasions, reaffirmed in public the obligations they have assumed towards Czechoslovakia, and have asserted that those obligations would be faithfully carried out if the need arose. M. Delbos, when Foreign Minister, was good enough to explain to the Prime -Minister and the late Foreign Secretary, during his visit to London with M. Chautemps in November last, his conception of the operation of the Franco-Czechoslovak Treaty of 1925 in such an event. M. Delbos said that if there were no act of aggression the treaty would not come into operation, but, if there were armed intervention by Germany, it was evident that the treaty would apply. He observed that, in practice, the matter would depend upon the gravity of the facts. The incursion of one or two armed men over the frontier would not necessarily mean aggression. But if the aggression were real, whatever form it took, the treaty would apply. Again, on the 15th March, the French Ambassador, in a conversation with Lord Halifax, said that the latter would have seen the statements made by M. Delbos a few days previously as to the immediate action France would take in the event of any aggression being perpetrated on Czechoslovakia.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government have given anxious consideration to the situation created by the incorporation of Austria in the German Reich, and, in particular, to the possibility of German action in Czechoslovakia similar to that already taken in Austria. They fully share the preoccupations of the French Government at the present time, and although neither the French Government nor the Czechoslovak Government have requested from them any declaration of the attitude they would adopt in the event of an unprovoked attack being made upon Czechoslovakia, His Majesty5 s Government have carefully reviewed their present- commitments in the light of the present situation, and have earnestly considered whether it is in their power to give any further undertaking which might help to stabilise the position in Europe.3. The French Government are, of course, aware of the extent of the under-takings by which His Majesty&apos;s Government are at present bound. Their obliga-tions to Czechoslovakia are those of one member of the League to another. His Majesty5si;Government maintain, and intend to maintain, their membership of the League, and will do their best to fulfil their obligations as a member of the League, within the measure of their capacity, and to the extent to which common action can be secured. His Majesty5s Government have acknowledged that in present circumstances the ability of the League to fulfil all the functions originally contemplated for it is reduced; but this is not to be interpreted as meaning that His Majesty5s Government would in no circumstances intervene as a member of the League for the restoration of peace or the maintenance of international order if circumstances were such as to make it appropriate for. them to do so. The French Government will remember that the late Foreign Secretary, in his speech at Leamington on the 20th November, 1936, defining the uses for which British arms might be employed, said that they might be used in bringing help to a victim of aggression in any case where, in our judgment, it would be proper under the provisions of the Covenant to do so.4. The specific obligation of His Majesty&apos;s Government to France, apart from the obligation of one member of the League to another, is that contained in the Treaty of Locarno. This obligation was reaffirmed in the arrangement drawn up in London on the 19th March, 1936, and His Majesty5s Government wish to take this opportunity once again to reaffirm that the obligations and guarantees undertaken by them as regards France in the Treaty of Locarno Subsist in their entirety, and that they will accordingly come to the assistance Of France in the event of an unprovoked act of aggression upon her by Germany. His Majesty5s Government wish at the same time to inform the French Govern-ment that, with a view to making further arrangements as regards the technical conditions in which these obligations should be carried out in the case of unprovoked aggression, they propose at an early date to authorise confidential communications on a technical -footing between the British and French Air Staffs. They will make a further communication to the French Government on this subject in due course.
&quot;6o    His Majesty&apos;s Government would not, however, pretend that,  where peace and war are concerned,  legal obligations are alone involved, and that if war broke out it would be likely to be confined to those who have assumed such obligations.    It would be quite imnossible t.o say where it might end and what Governments might become involved.    The inexorable pressure of facts,  revealing threats to vital interests, might well prove more powerful than formal-pronouncements,  and in that event it would be &quot;well within the bounds of probability that other countries, besides those which were parties to the original dispute,  would almost immediately be involved.    This is especially true in the case of two countries with long associations of friendship like Great Britain and France, which are devoted to the same ideals of
5. These are the obligations which His Majesty&apos;s Government have assumed, and His Majesty&apos;g Government intend to abide by them. Those commit-ments are, in their view, no mean contribution to the maiiitenarice of peace in Europe, and, though they have no intentipn of withdrawing from them, they cannot see their way to add to them. His Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciate the anxieties of the Frefteh Government and their wish for further assurances, but they are confident that the French Government will appreciate in their, turn the reasons which have always precluded this country from entering in advance into new and more extensive commitments in respect of the European continent! His Majesty&apos;s Government have frequently had occasion to state that, for reasons connected both with domestic politics and with their association with other parts of the British Commonwealth, which preclude His Majesty&apos;s Government from surrendering their liberty of decision in advance, it is impossible for them to assume any further commitments in Europe beyond those embodied in the Treaty of Locarno and the Covenant of the League: In particular, as was stated by the Prime Minister to M. Chaiitemps and M. Delbos during their conversation in London on the 29th November last, His Majesty&apos;s Government could certainly hot go so far as to state What their action might be in the event of an attack upon Czechoslovakia, by Germany, They are accordingly hot in a position to undertake an obligation in advance to render military assistance to France in cases and circumstances not covered by the Treaty of Locarno.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government would not, however, pretend that, where peace and war are concerned, legal obligations are alone involved, and. that if war broke out it would be likely to be confined to those who have asjskmed such obligations. ^It would be quite impossibk^tSTsay where it might nc^eiia and what Governments might not become invojve^. The inexorable pressure of facts, revealingj*fe1*eats to vital interests, milght well prove more powerful than formal pronpHncements, o^cl sad it would be**probable that a Government, though not partv ,,bo the original c dispute, wgurla almost immediately be involved. This is especially true in the case of two countries with long associations of friendship like Great Britain and France, which are devoted to the same ideals of democratic liberty and are determined to uphold them.7. In What has been said above,.His Majesty&apos;s Government have naturally not had it in mind to offer advice to the French Government as to their own conduct in these matters, or to question their right to decide for themselves, if the case arose, Whether or not their obligations to Czechoslovakia had become operative, and if so, in what manner those obligations should be fulfilled. But in considering what their owh policy should be in the present situation, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are entitled, and indeed bound, to review the position as they see it. And they would be lacking in the frankness which happily accompanies the complete confidence that marks the relationship between the two Governments, if they did not express to the French Government the misgivings which the present military situation arouses in their minds.8. It is undeniable that the military position of Czechoslovakia lias been seriously weakened by the incorporation of Austria in the Reich. The absence of fortifications along the former Czechoslovak-Austrian frontier lays the heart of Czechoslovakia open to German attack. There is little hope, therefore, that mili-tary operations against Germany by the two countries which have given Czecho-slovakia pledges of assistance, namely,. France and the Soviet Union, could be made effective in time to prevent the military occupation of Czechoslovakia if and when Germany decided to make an attack upon her. The restoration of Czecho-slovakia would therefore have to await the conclusion of a victorious campaign against Germany by those who had taken up arm  in CzechoslovakiaV defence. The war in any case would be likely to be a long one, and if His Majesty&apos;s Governr ment became engaged, they would not be in a position to contribute at the outset such forces as would help to secure an early victorious conclusion. Their main contribution, in the early stages of the war, would be exercise of economic pressure, by means of sea power, and this, as experience has shown,; is slow in operation and tardy in its effects. , His Majesty&apos;s Government do not press for any answer to the question which Lord Halifax put tti M, Corbin on the 12th March as to what would, ih the French view, be their method of rendering [16916] ...-------  b 2
assistance to .Czechoslovakia if the need arose; this is, however, a problem upon which His Majesty&apos;s Government have been reflecting, and they cannot say that the result of their reflections is encouraging.9. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel, therefore, that every possible step should be taken both by the French Government and by His Majesty&apos;s Government to help remove the causes of friction or even of conflict by usuig their good offices with the Government of Czechoslovakia to bring about a settlement of questions affecting the position of the German minority. His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that it is possible to find such a solution of German minority questions as would be compatible with ensuring the integrity of the Czechoslovak State, while retaining that minority within the frontiers of Czechoslovakia. The-Czecho-slovak Government, in view of the relations of confidence which they enjoy with the Fmmh Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government, have never resented or questioned the interest taken by those two Governments in minority questions arising within the boundaries of Czechoslovakia. His Majesty&apos;s Government would therefore urge that this matter, along Avith the question of other steps that might be taken, is one for joint and early consideration between the two Govern-ments. His Majesty&apos;s Government take this opportunity of assuring the French Government of the high importance which they attach to the closest collaboration between the two Governments, and of their conviction that in their continued collaboration in the pursuit of the ideals which they equally share lies the best hope of establishing peace and confidence in Europe.ENCLOSURE 2.Viscount Halifax to Sir E. Phi-pps (Paris). (No. 95.  Most Immediate.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, March 23, 1938.   &apos;MY despatch No. 581 of 22nd March : Czechoslovakia.We recognise that some disappointment will probably be felt by French Government at aide-memoire which you have been instructed to present, and that theyijmay be reluctant to accept our conclusions.There are certain other arguments which we have hesitated to commit to paper, but which you may perhaps be able to use orally.It has been urged, both in this country and in France, that, rather than to wait upon events, it would be better at once for France and Great Britain to indicate clearly that they would take action against Germany in the event of the latter being held to have violated Czechoslovak independence. As against that, it (may be questioned whether any advantage is to be derived from uttering a warning against action which the German Government have declared that they -do not contemplate. I do not wish to attach any undue value to the assurances given by Field-Marshal Goring regarding Czechoslovakia. At the same time, if we treat them as of no worth, would that not encourage the German Government to consider that they were entitled lightly to withdraw or to ignore them?Our other objection to uttering a warning, or a threat, arises from our doubt as to our ability, or the ability of France and Great Britain combined, effectively to enforce it. Our effort in rearmament has been considerable, but we are only approaching the stage where production will give us a return on the expenditure on which we have embarked. Quite frankly, the moment is unfavourable, and our plans, both for offence and defence, are not sufficiently advanced.We have dealt, in our aide-memoire/with the precarious military situation of Czechoslovakia. We have not added the consideration that Germany now &quot;controls Czechoslovakia^ only effective communication with the rest of the world and could easily establish an economic strangle-hold which, even without military action, could bring Czechoslovakia to her knees in a short time. Any reinforce-ment of the military guarantees which Czechoslovakia already enjoys might, in fact, therefore tempt Germany to achieve her object by means of economic pressure alone. We did not wish to set out the whole weakness of Czechoslovakia^ position in a document which suggested that that country should make every
effort to bring about a settlement of questions at issue with Germany.. That would have suggested too plainly that Czechoslovakia was at a disadvantage in dealing direct with Germany. But it is a point which the French Government and Flis Majesty&apos;s Government should have in mind.Finally, I should like to make it clear that, if a settlement is to be reached of the problem of the German minority in Czechoslovakia, it will be necessary at some stage to bring thewGerman Government into the negotiation. In our aide-memoire we have spoken of the French Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government-&quot; using their good offices with the Government of Czechoslovakia to bring about a settlement of questions affecting the position of the German minority.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government do not doubt that the Czechoslovak Government will take all possible measures to do justice to their German minority. But evidently the establishment of good relations between Czechoslovakia and Germany depends on the latter being satisfied as to the regime provided by the Czechoslovak Government for that minority or at any rate being deprived of legitimate grievances in relation thereto. It will therefore, sooner or later, be necessary to approach the German Government in this matter. No mention is made in the aide-memoire of any approach to Germany, as that can only come at a later stage. But if we ever reach that stage, I should hope that the French Government would not be able to say that we had given them no warning that we contemplated bringing Germany into discussion, and I should be glad therefore if you would make it clear to them that in our view, if things go well, that will at some stage be inevitable.You should still await further instructions before acting on my despatch No. 581 and on the present telegram.ENCLOSURE 3.Viscount Halifax to Sir E. PhijJps (Paris). (No. 96.  Most Immediate.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, March 23, 1938.YOU are now authorised to take action on my despatch No. 581 and my telegram No. 95 of 22nd and 23rd March : Czechoslovakia.If convenient, you should see Minister for Foreign Affairs this evening. - If this is not convenient, you should see him as early as possible to-morrow. I should like the French Government to be in possession of our communication as Ljng as possible in advance of statement of policy which is being made in Parliament on afternoon of the 24th March, One possible advantage of making communication to-morrow would be that it would in that event more or less synchronise with communication which His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Prague is being instructed to make to the Czechoslovak Government. Copy of the instruc-tions which are being sent to him come to you by bag to-night.If Minister for Foreign Affairs should suggest that French Government would have liked to be consulted by His Majesty&apos;s Government before latter came to decisions set forth in their aide-memoire, your answer might be that had French Ministers come to London before His Majesty&apos;s Government had made up their minds, it would have been embarrassing for us; and that since His Majesty&apos;s Government could have come to no other decision than that which they have now reached, it would have been embarrassing for French Ministers to go back to Paris with nothing better for their pains.Finally, you will, of course, impress on the French Government the necessity for keeping the terms of our communication secret, except in so far as they may be made public in statement of policy which is being made in Parliament to-morrow afternoon, the 24th March. In particular it is quite essential that there should be no leakage as regards air staff conversations.
