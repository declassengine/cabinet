(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ) .C OPYNo . _U&quot; secret.CP. NO. 104.CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, &quot;by . the Government of India,  dated 21st May, 1938.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
2 S confidential appreciation of the Political situation in India, dated the 21st May, 1938 issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1.     ,      Provincial Ministries.    The ministerial crisis in Orissa,  the genesis of which was described in the last appreciation, assumed increasing importance as the date of the Governor&apos;s departure on leave drew near.    Public statements made by Mr.  Gandhi and the Congress President towards the end of April threatened repercussions throughout India if Mr. Bain&apos;s appointment were not cancelled.    It is probable that the Premiers of Congress Provinces had not been consulted on their willingness to implement this threat:    hut they would not have been likely to disobey an order to resign..   The crisis ended with the Governor(s announcement  (made on the eve of the date fixed for his departure) that he had been permitted to cancel his leave, and had decided to take that action in the interests of the province owing to the instability of the political situation.    This result was received with general relief.    Though Congress naturally regard it as a triumph, comment has for the most part been restrained.    Moslem opinion has, with rather less restraint, condemned it as a surrender to Congress dictation.    In spite of&apos; the answers given to the questions in the House of Commons,  the opportunity has been seized by the politicians to demand that officials should not in future be appointed as Governors of Provinces.In the Central Provinces the Congress Ministry has been tottering and does not yet seem, safe from collapse. The enquiry into the scandal mentioned in the last appreciation has concluded.    The verdict has not yet been
announced .by the Congress Working Committee;    but meanwhile the dissensions in the ministry led to the resignation of three ministers.    It is still not clear whether the team -with or without Shareef, the erring law Minister - will be reassembled through the efforts of the Working Committee.Another cause of trouble in this Province is an enquiry which has been set up into what is known as the Bilaspur election, at which Mr. Raghavendra Rao (who was at the time of the election a member of the Governor&apos;s Executive Council) scored a substantial victory over his Congress opponent.    Using a provincial enactment passed early this year, the Government appointed a tribunal, with a High Court judge as president,  to examine allegations of corrupt practices and undue official influence.    To watch the interests of the officials involved counsel were appointed:   but when the enquiry recently began the Government cancelled the appointments on the ground that theytore concerned in the matter under enquiry.    This action elicited a vigorous protest from the tribunal, but other counsel have now been appointed.&apos;   At present the enquiry has only reached the stage of argument on a preliminary question of jurisdiction.In&apos;the North West Frontier Province the Ministers&apos; presence at functions held in honour of the visit of His Excellency.the Viceroy in April was considered to be in defiance of Congress orders forbidding attendance at functions of the kind.    Mr. Gandhi visited the Province at the beginning of May;    the Congress party has since passed a vote of confidence in the Ministry and the Premier has publicly announced his submission to the Congress Central command. -i&apos;-r
2-6 in Sind it is reported that one of two new Moslem Ministers 4aas signed the Congress pledge.    The only &quot;Political&apos;&apos; prisoner in the Province was prematurely released on 5th May.The Bengal Legislature has recently passed a Tenancy Bill of a contentious nature.    The Premier has publicly stated that, if assent is withheld by the Governor or Governor-General, a grave crisis will ensue. The Tenancy Bill recently introduced in the United Provinces Legislature is meeting with strong opposition from the landowners.    ^he Bihar Ministry have been concentrating on a &quot;mass literacy&quot; campaign.    &quot;Prohibition&apos; has been started in parts of seven Provinces;    in Madras (the first Province to introduce the measure) the Government profess to be well satisfied with the results, but a verdict on its success would be premature.Nearly all the budget sessions of the provincial legislatures have concluded.    Agrarian legislation to benefit tenants at the expense of the landlords has occupied a prominent place in the business of a number of Provinces.    -Among the measures passed by the Bombay Legislature is one securing to the Commissioner of Police the power to extern hooligans from the city;    and a Trade Disputes Bill was introduced late in the session, intended to make the strike weapon illegal until various stages of arbitration have been tried.The&apos;Congress Party.    Subhas Bose, the President, made a somewhat ineffective tour of Assam in April,  and Mr.  Gandhi toured the North West Frontier Province for nine days early in May.    Attention has recently been focussed om. a conference of all Congress Premiers at
4.Bombay which was convened on May 12th in order to co-ordinate the policy of Congress Provinces.    No official reports of the decisions have been published.    On one matter of some importance - the rights and duties of Parliamentary Secretaries - the decision is said to be unfavourable to the pretensions put forward by and on behalf of these functionaries in some provinces.    The Working Committee commenced a session on 15th May in Bombay.    The chaos in the Central Provinces Ministry is one of the subjects under its consideration.In furtherance of the cause of Indian clove merchants in the Zanzibar dispute, a boycott of cloves imported from Zanzibar at major Indian ports has been sponsored by Congress Party;    the controversy has been ended by a recent settlement, and the Working Committee has called off the boycott.3. The Moslem League and Congress.      On 17th April -18th April a special session of the Moslem League was held in Calcutta, ostensibly to consider its attitude- towards the Lahore Shahidganj dispute. &apos;. Having expressed its approval of the Punjab&apos;s action,  the session proceeded to attack the Congress party,&apos; and passed resolutions&apos; congratulating the ministers in Assam and Bengal on their firm stand against Congress intrigues, and condemning the failure of Congress Ministries to safeguard the interests of minorities, particularly during communal disturbances.A topic of great interest has been the negotiations between Congress and the Moslem League.-   This began with correspondence between Mr.. Jinnah and Pandit Jawahar Lai Nehru, and continued with conversations between Mr.  Gandhi
2T704.Bombay which was convened on May 12th in order to co-ordinate the policy of Congress Provinces.    No official reports of the decisions have been published.    On one matter of some importance - the rights and duties of Parliamentary-Secretaries - the decision is said to be unfavourable to the pretensions put forward by and on behalf of these functionaries in some provinces.    The Working Committee commenced a session on 15th May in Bombay.    The chaos in the Central Provinces Ministry is one of the subjects under its consideration.In furtherance of the cause of Indian clove merchants in the Zanzibar dispute, a boycott of cloves imported from Zanzibar at major Indian ports has been sponsored by Congress Party;    the controversy has been ended by a recent settlement, and the Working Committee has called off the boycott.3. The Moslem League and Congress.      On 17th April -18th April a special session of the Moslem League was held in Calcutta, ostensibly to consider its attitude towards the Lahore Shahidganj dispute.    Having expressed its approval of the Punjab&apos;s action,  the session proceeded to attack the Congress party, and passed resolutions congratulating the ministers in Assam and Bengal on their firm stand against Congress intrigues, and condemning the failure of Congress Ministries to safeguard the interests of minorities, particularly during communal disturbances.A topic of great interest has been the negotiations between Congress and the Moslem League.    This began with correspondence between Mr. Jinnah and Pandit Jawahar Lai Nehru, and continued with conversations between Mr.  Gandhi
21 iand Mr.  Jinnah in Bombay on 28th April, and with further conversations between Mr. Jinnah and Subhas Bose (the Congress President)  in Bombay in the middle of May.No announcement has been made of positive results. The desire of Congress to secure united opposition to the federal scheme and its concern over the increasing influence of the Moslem League, and over the inconvenience caused to Congress Ministries by communal disturbances, make it probable that an earnest attempt has been made to meet Mr.  Jinnah&apos;s claims:    but,  in view of the wide gulf between the two parties, and jealous fears of himself in Bengal, and of Moslems generally,  some scepticism as to the likelihood of a settlement is justified.      The Congress bid is likely to be placed before the Council of the Moslem League shortly. 4. Communal trouble.    Although there have been nofurther disturbances between the Hindu and Moslem&apos;communities, loss of life and injuries have been caused in a riot in Lucknow between two sects of Moslems known as Shias and Sunnis.      These have recently reopened an obscure dispute which began in 1905,  and which goes by the name of the Madh-e-Sahaba dispute.      The point at issue is the right of the Sunnis to recite certain verses which give offence to the Shias.      An official committee was set up in June 1937 to investigate the rights of the parties;    its report, with the resolution of United Provinces Government accepting its findings, was published at the end of March;    this gave no satisfaction to the Sunnis, who attacked a Shia procession in Lucknow on 22nd April;    the riot which ensued was responsible for 10 deaths and 160 injuries.      The police had to open fire to restore order but caused no casualties. Restiveness amongst the Sunnis then took the form of civil
T1Xdisobedience:    but conciliation has for the time being brought the trouble to an end.As a result of frequent communal disturbances in the United Provinces, the Government have taken, steps to prevent the dissemination in the Press of matters likely to embitter communal relations.The Shahidgunj Dispute is again before the courts, an application having been made for leave to appeal to the Privy Council against the decision of the High Court which went in favour of the Sikhs,      Meantime the show of civil disobedience has subsided.The Hindu Ha-hasabha,  a purely communal organisation opposed to any conciliation of the Moslems and differing, from the Congress Party on some important points of principle, has recently shown signs of renewed activity under the leadership of Y.D. Sararkar who has been touring the North-Vfesterh Provinces of India and making speeches calculated still further to embitter the relations between the communities.5. Communism.      The annual conference of the CongressSocialists in Lahore in the middle of April was attended by as many communists as socialists.      The policy of working under the shelter of Congress was voiced in professed appreciation of the work of the Congress Ministries in ful-fulfilment of their election pledges.      It was stated that the socialists would net deliberately create difficulties for the Ministries but would serve as  &quot;a corrective to mistaken policies of Congress&quot;.      Jealousies over leadership and group rivalries are as keen as ever in the left wing and the question whether communists should be allowed to join the Congress socialists was left undecided.
6. Labour.     Serious trouble is again threatening inCawnpore.    The Labour Enquiry Committee has, after a prolonged silence, published its recommendations, which include an increase in wages for all workers,  a minimum wage, and other proposals favourable to the workers.      The workers have accepted the recommendations.      The employers have rejected them.      On May 16th, 15,000 mill workers went on strike,  and the number has now risen to 30,000.      The peace has not yet been broken and every precaution is being taken;    but, if no way is soon found to a settlement, the danger of disturbance is grave.. An unusual situation arose in the Madras Presidency, when the management&apos;of a European-owned mill in Madura,  at which a lock-out had been declared, decided to reopen the mills on April 20th without taking back some 2,000 men previously employed.      Apprehending rioting and disorder, the Government demanded that the men should be re-employed as a condition precedent to the opening of the mills;    the management refused.      The Government, thereupon instructed the police to apply to the local magistrate for a prohibitory order to restrain the management from opening mills,  and this  order was issued.      The management then agreed to refer the dispute to arbitration and to reinstate the old employes&apos;.      The mills reopened on 2.4th April. The use of  a prohibitory order for this purpose is novel: and it ia interesting to find a. Congress Ministry finding a new use far a provision of the law which Congress has professed to regard with disapproval.In Bombay all employers have agreed to accept the recommendations of the Enquiry Committee lor an increase in wages,    and the situation is  quiet.? * Economic.        There has been no improvement in the
conditions of severe scarcity in three districts of the Madras Presidency;    elsewhere harvesting of spring crops has heen in progress and prospects are satisfactory. 8. Waziristan.    The situation in Waziristan has deteriorated and hostile acts have been numerous.    These have, however, mostly been the work of individuals or small gangs instigated by the Faqir of Ipi, and there is no general tribal unrest.    The Faqir of Ipi is  still in or on the border of Madda Khel country.    That tribe having failed to turn him out or control him, is being held responsible for hostile acts committed at his instigation, and air action against the tribe is about to take place after due warning to the population to evacuate the areas concerned.    The most serious incident during the month was an engagement which took -place at Dargai Sar in South Waziristan between scouts and a large hostile gang under Mulla Sher Ali.    The scouts suffered 14 casualties including one British officer killed, and the enemy casualties are believed to have been considerably heavier.As a result of this incident, air action was taken against 3 small valleys in South Waziristan, from which the gang originated.    On April 30th, a Muhammadan subordinate official was shot dead near Shahur Tangi on the Jandola-Sarwakai Road.    In Worth Waziristan, G-agu and his gang have been active, and on two or three occasions have fired on scouts patrol parties, but have cuased no damage.    The planting of bombs continues without serious effect except in one case at Mir Ali when 3 Indian Other Ranks were wounded and some mules were killed or wounded.    On two occasions attempts have been made to contaminate the water
supply in Worth Waziristan with picric acid, a new feature in tribal warfare.    There have been two more raids in the Bannu District,  resulting in the kidnapping of 4 Hindus and 1 Muhammadau..    2 Sikhs have a],so been kidnapped in the Dera Ismail Khan District.
