IIS DOCUMENT IS&apos;THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMLNT. ICRET.P. 114(58). COPY NO.   40Q-A J I NET.*r -      -    -...... fPRODUCTION OF OIL PROM COAL: Falmouth Committee&apos;s Report. Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate to ray colleagues a memorandum which has been prepared &quot;by the Secretary for Mines, after consultation with the Departments concerned,  on the action to he taken in regard to the recommendations in the published edition of the Report of the Falmouth Committee (Cmd.5665).The recommendations in a summarised form are set out on page 1 of the memorandum;    and I propose, with the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that all the recommendations should he accepted,  with some reservation on recommendation 11(2) which concerns the proposed extension of the scope of the tests carried out by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research on low temperature carbonisation plants (see page 10 of the memorandum).The first and main recommendation is that which proposes&apos;that a preference at the rate of 8d. per gallon should be guaranteed for a period of twelve years from 1938 on motor spirit and diesel oil for use in road vehicles, manufactured from coal,  shale or peat, indigenous to the United Kingdom,  or from products produced from those substances (see Section l(l) of the British Hydrocarbon Oils (Production) Act, 1954).    This recommendation involves legislation; and the question whether it should be dealt with in the Finance Bill or in a separate Bill is under examination.t I understand that those recommendations of the Falmouth Committee relating mainly io Defence, which are included in their full Report /5.I.D. Paper 272-A;    Annex I to C.P.19(38j/ and were referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence /Cahinet 4(38), conclusion 9/, are still under consideration.O.F.G.S.Board of Trade,13th May, 1938.
SECRET.FALMOUTH COMMITTEE&apos;S REPORT.*r Consideration of Recommendations * included in published Report (and. 5665).Memorandum by the Secretary, for Mines. The recommendations of the Committee are set forth in full on pages 62 and 63 of the Report (Cmd. 5665). Briefly summarized they are as follows:I. Extension&apos; for further period of Guaranteed Preference.That the present guaranteed preference of 4d. per gallon on motor spirit should be raised to 8d.  and to he operative for 12 years from 1938;    the guarantee being extended to diesel oil for use in road vehicles.,  the benefit of the preference being available,  as at present, equally to all processes.II. Low. Temperature Carbonisation.(l) That assistance to this industry should be limited to participation in the benefits to be derived from the guaranteed preference;    the grant.of direct financial assistance for the establishment of further plants cannot be justified.(2) That the facilities provided by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for carrying out, free of charge,  tests of low temperature carbonisation plants should be, continued;    and extended to cover all technical points.111* Synthetic Processes.That it would be of considerable advantage if the establishment of a plant to work the Fischer process could be secured (by private enterprise);    with the possibility of some Government financial assistance for carrying out approved items of research work.IV. Scottish Shale Oil Industry.That the grant of the further guaranteed preference proposed would be of great assistance in encouraging the development of this industry.-V. Research.In the body of the Report there is a recommendation on the importance of continuing research on an -adequate scale (paragraphs 252/3).I. Extension for further period of Guaranteed Preference.This is the most important recommendation made by the Committee.      In paragraph 268 the Committee remark that in putting forward this form of assistance they are advocating the adoption of a long-term policy, which they believe,  in the circumstances, is the correct policy to adopt.
Except for the possibility of the grant of some financial assistance in connection with research work of an approved character, which might &quot;be carried out in connection with a plant to work the Fischer process, the Committee are opposed to the grant of Government financial help for the establishment of oil from coal plants.      But the Committee are clearly impressed with the serious work which-is being carried on, and with the future possibilities- of these processes.In Section III of their report, the Committee deal at some length with the reasons which in their view justify their recommendation for continued Government assistance by means of the guaranteed&quot; preferenceo      Briefly these may he summarised as follows;-(a) This country is still without sufficient experienceof the working of oil from coal processes on the commercial scale, particularly those designed primarily for the production of oil, to enable definite conclusions to be drawn as to whether these processes are likely, within a reasonable period, to be economically exploited.(b) That with the high rate of expenditure during the early years of development, commercial interests cannot be expected to undertake the exploitation of these processes unless there continues to be available a measure of assistance which, will give a prospect of a reasonable financial returns(c) That future developments in these pro cesses are unforeseeable,and that great improvements in technique, as a result of further experience may result in lowering costs and improving the yield and range of fuels produced.(d) This country cannot afford to lag behind o,ther countriesin the accumulation of technical data in connection with the treatment of coal and in the training of scientific personnel.(e) Without assistance of the kind proposed the present scale of home production would decline, a step which the Committee would regard as a retrograde one.The Committee recognise that the measure of assistance they propose is a very substantial one, amounting to something approaching a 200 per cento protective tariff, and they point outthat if this incentive fails to achieve.results, then it would onlybe reasonable to conclude that these processes, particularly the
hydrogenation and synthetic processes which are designed primarily for the production of oil, are at present so far removed from economic success, that any other form of assistance would not he justified.In face of the conclusions of the Committee that at present oil from coal processes do not offer any great prospects of providing new openings for employment on any substantial scale, and that in general a policy of depending on imported supplies with adequate storage is the most reliable and economical means of providing for an emergency, it may well he asked whether the Government would be justified in accepting this recommendation.The Committee themselves provide one answer to this in paragraph 41, where after reviewing the situation in regard to supplies and possible price movements of natural petroleum, and reaching the conclusion that the position is a satisfactory one so far as the next few years are concerned, they remark&quot;Nevertheless, the situation may change, and if this should happen within- a period of even ten or fifteen years from now, it must he recognised that a considerable number of years would he required in which to establish a new industry on the scale necessary to meet the needs of this country,&quot; In paragraph 259 the Committee state that they have given the most careful consideration to the action which they consider should he taken in order to secure the maintenance of the present interest, and that measure of further development which in their view is called for.     The result is the recommendation for the extension of the guaranteed preference.*While it is recognised that Governments are not bound to accept the recommendations of Committees which they appoint, it seems only too likely that the non-acceptance of the main recommendation of this Committee will give rise to a good deal of political feeling, which will not be limited to the Opposition,As the grant of a guaranteed preference of so large,an amount for a period of 12 years might conceivably result in a
material reduction in trie amount of revenue obtained from the import duty,  the Committee recommend certain safeguards to the Exchequer. Paragraphs 272 and 275 contain the specificsafeguards suggested, viz.:-(a) If the average declared c.i.f. value of motor spiritor gas oil in 1941, or any subsequent year, exceeds the average for 1957 by Id. per gallon or more, the guaranteed -preference on motor spirit or road diesel oil respectively should be reduced by  d. per gallon for the first Id. of the excess, and by a further id. for each additional ^d. of the excess.(b) If production from home sources of motor spirit or roaddiesel oil in 1941 or any subsequent year reaches 20 per cent, of home consumption, the guaranteed preference on the product concerned should be reduced by Id. per gallon, with a further reduction of Id. per gallon for each additional 5 per cent.rThe Committee state that they appreciate that numerous alternative sliding scales could be framed, and they have submitted those suggested as a basis for consideration.      They also draw attention to the steadily increasing consumption of imported oils which, unless a very lc,rge increase in home production of oil were to take place, might mean that there would be no actual reduction in the amount of revenue received by the Exchequer.The suggestions made bjr the Committee for safeguarding the Exchequer appear to be reasonable and workable and, if the main recommendation is accepted, they might be adopted.On the other hand, the Committee point out that certain factors, such as a decrease in the price of imported oil, or increases in the cost of materials (including coal) and v/ages in connection with oil from coal plants, might operate to cause the present margin in favour of imported oil to increase still further.     The Committee add that it would only be possible to meet such a contingency by the grant of direct financial assistance, which the Committee do not recommend,  and they are of opinion that the risk is one which those who may undertake the development of oil from coal processes will have to face. There is no reason to disagree with this view.
Since the Committee reported, however, the tax on motor spirit and diesel oil for road vehicles has been increased from 8d to 9d per gallon,  and this may cause the question to be raised whether the arrangement provided for in the British Byd.rocarbon Oils (Production) Act, 1934, for shortening the -period, of the guarantee,  if the preference actually granted exceeds the amount of the guaranteed preference,  should not be continued.     The Committee did not specifically deal with such a contingency for they assumed that there was little likelihood of the tax of 8d per gallon being increased but it can be said that they attached great &apos;importance to the maintenance of the period of the guarantee. This would leave any excess of actual preference over the guaranteed amount to be dealt with;   if it is considered necessary, by means of an excise,   in the same way as it may prove necessary to apply&apos; the safeguards already referred to.The Committee&apos;s proposal to extend the guaranteed preference to diesel oil for use in road vehicles is a reasonable one.    It is important,  if the further development of the shale oil industry is to be secured (for diesel oil for road vehicles is now the main product of that industry), and also to the establishment of a Fischer plant,   in view of the claims made that a good diesel oil can be produced.As to what further development is likely to be obtained if the Committee&apos;s recommendation for an e:xtention of the guaranteed preference is accepted,  the Committee point out in paragraph. 260 that most of the proposals submitted to them involved a large measure of Government assistance,   including both, an extension of the guaranteed preference for a number- of years, and-some form of provision of capital.      The Committee,  as already pointed out, reject the idea of direct financial assistance by the Government for the establishment of further plants.    Nevertheless the Committee hope that, with a guaranteed preference of 8d for a r-ieriod of 12 years, private enterprise may be encouraged to embark on further development within that period.. &quot;They remark, - however thai
experience may show that a guaranteed preference, even of a larger amount than is at present afforded, will not result in further plants being built.    If that should prove to be the case, the Committee add that then there will be no further loss of revenue to the Exchequer; if, on the other hand, there &quot;should be some further foregoing of revenue, it will be because private enterprise has been willing to do its part in attempting to carry further these important developments.Dealing with the three methods which are concerned primarily with the production of oil, the evidence submitted to the Committee on possibilities of developments may be summarized as follows:(a) Scottish Shale Oil. Industry.In the course of two or three years the production of shale might be doubled.   On the basis of production of oil products in 1957 this virould give a production of some 40,000 tons (12 million gallons) of motor spirit, and 100,000 tons (26 million gallons) of diesel oil for road vehicles.    This would mean an add.itional production of about 70,000 tons, which on the basis of 8d. a gallon would represent about  650,000 in revenue.    The production of diesel oil would represent about one-third of the current consumption of road diesel oil.   The consumption is however steadily increasing,(b) Hydrogenation,LCI. Limited, informed the Committee that even if the guarantee of protection were unlimited, they would not,extend their hydrogenation commitments for at least another two years (from July, 1937), when they would have derived full benefit from the Billingham experience.    The current rate of production from the plant is approaching its rated capacity and there would therefore appear tovbe little prospect of any material additional output from this process for some time - a new plant would take at least two or three years to build.As *ne same time it is known that the Company have beenspending considerable sums in improvements in the existing plantwhich experience has shown to be necessary.    Unless there is to toe ah extension of the guarantee it is doubtful whether further-6-
expenditure of this kind would be incurred, although the plant may continue working as long as a preference is actually continued on the present scale, although not guaranteed. (c) Synthetic -processes.The Committee state that it is clear from the evidence obtained that a considerable measure of assistance in some form from the Government would be required before any commercial concern would contemplate the erection of a plant.    As regards the question of the guaranteed preference, the period suggested was usually about 12 years, although a period of 20 years was also mentioned.    One witness appeared to be confident that if a guarantee of 8d. per gallon for 12 years were given, private enterprise could find the capital for a plant of a commercial scale - which the Committee understood would not be less than 20,000 tons and might be as large as 60,000 tons of primary product.    The quantity of refined products would depend on the products made, but would be less than the quantity of primary product.    On the higher of these figures the revenue involved would represent about  ,\ million.    The plant would take two to three years to establish.In the case of the carbonisation industries there might be some further production of benzol at gas works.    It is not possible to give an estimate of the quantity&apos;, but it would not be large.There seems little likelihood, therefore, that for several years there would be any further serious inroad into the revenue received by the Exchequer from oil import duties.In view of the very definite expression of opinion by the Committee that a guaranteed preference of at least 8d. per gallon is required under present conditions there seems little object in discussing any alternative proposal and the
issue therefore appears to he either acceptance of the Committee&apos;s proposal or allowing the present guarantee to run its course, which would, under- conditions which obtained before the present Budget, be completed in September, 1939. (Unless an excise duty is imposed the recent increase in the duty from 8d.  to 9d. per gallon will still further shorten the period.)The question may be raised whether, even if a guaranteed preference of 8d. is necessary for the processes primarily concerned with the production of oil, it is essential that the by-product industries should receive assistance on this scale. The Committee, received evidence which indicated that while the larger coke ovens and gas works could extract benzol at perhaps 4d,  a gallon, some could not make it pay at 8d.  a gallon;     In paragraph 274 the Committee give their reasons for not favouring discrimination and as the quantities of oil products which can be produced by the carbonisation industries are limited by the demand for their main products, there would seem to be good grounds for accepting the view of the Committee.On the question whether difficulties might arise in 1950, when the guaranteed preference would come to an end, the answer would appear to be that&apos;either the degree of development will still be of such small proportions that the problem will be little different from that which has now to be faced;    or, if there has been development on a large scale, then the extent of the guarantee will have been reduced under the safeguards proposed by the Committee, and it will be possible to review the situation without any serious difficulty arising. H*    Low- Temperature Carbonisation.(a) Grant of direct financial assistance.The Committee give considerable attention to this subject in view of the claims which have been made that a large
development of low temperature carbonisation processes would &quot;be of great value from an employment point of view, and would result in a substantial production of oil.     The&apos; Committee were not satisfied on the employment claim and in paragraphs 119-125 they give their reasons why they consider that a really large scale development of low temperature carbonisation is unlikely to be secured within a reasonable period.     They therefore conclude that low temperature carbonisation must, in the light of existing information, be ignored as a possible major source of indigenous oil supply.The Committee draw attention to the large number of methods of operating the low temperature carbonisation process and point out that while there is some variation in the yields of liquid products obtained by the different methods, the extent of the variations does not represent more than a few gallons per ton of coal carbonised.    Accordingly the Committee conclude that there is no single process which they could advise should have special consideration on account of the quantity of oil products obtained.     The Committee state that to the extent that low temperature carbonisation can develop on normal.lines it will, like the other carbonisation industries, make a contribution to the problem of smoke abatement and efficient fuel utilisation, and at the same time provide some addition to the country1s supplies of home-produced oil.The Committee see no reason why in these circumstances direct Government financial assistance should be given to the development of low temperature carbonisation.i There is no reason to disagree with the conclusions of the Committee and accordingly their recommendation can be accepted.The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research suggest that in view of misconceptions which have gained some currency, it should be pointed out that the Committees, conclusions should not he read as indicating that low temperature carbonisation
processes are, as ordinary commercial undertakings, undeserving of public - as distinct from Government - support, or that they can make no contribution to the national economy.The acceptance of the Committee&apos;s recommendation will not mean that applications for assistance in erecting low temperature carbonisation plants in the Special Areas will not he considered on the same basis as applications made in connection with other industrial undertakings.      This matter^ has already been considered, in the light of the Committee&apos;s recommendation by the Departments concerned and a Note of the procedure agreed,upon is set forth in the Annex to this Memorandum.(b) Extension of scope of official.....tests of low temperaturecarbonisation plants.The Committee comment in paragraphs 104-106 on the tests of low temperature carbonisation plants carried out by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and consider that these facilities should he continued.      They suggest that, the reports issued could he made of still greater value if they dealt with all technical points connected with the operation of, and the products of, the process as well as the carbonisation aspect of the process.     The Committee are opposed to an extension of the investigations to embrace economic factors.The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research feel that there is some ambiguity about the Committee&apos;s recommendation for an extension of the investigations already carried out and that, for example, a detailed examination of thevpossible methods of utilising the products might entail prolonged investigation and would make it impossible to complete the test within a reasonable time.      The Department feel that there is little more that can usefully be done in the tests they carry out, which they consider are quite exhaustive.      The
matter is one for administrative action and in announcing acceptance of the Committee&apos;s recommendations in regard to low temperature carbonisation it will be well to make some reservation orr this point, in a form to he agreed, with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. 111* Synthetic Processes.The Committee are impressed with the desirability of obtaining the establishment of a Fischer plant on a commercial scale in this country.      They point out that until this has been secured it is impracticable to assess the claims made for this process, or to test its suitability and value to this country.      The views of the Committee are summarised in paragraph 318.The Committee refer to the efforts which have been made by the C-overnment to bring together certain important commercial undertakings which had shown an interest in the possibility of establishing a plant in this country.     They took evidence from each of these concerns, represented by Lord Cadman, Sir Stephenson Kent and Colonel Appleyard,      The hope which the Committee express that, if their recommendation for an extension of the guaranteed preference is accepted, one or more industrial concerns may be induced to undertake the erection of such a plant, rests mainly on the evidence of Colonel Appleyard.      Sir Stephenson Kent who at^ne time had indicated the possibility of finding some portion of the capital if the Government found or guaranteed the major part, changed his views and in a letter to the Committee,  sent after he had given evidence, gave it as his considered opinion that the provision of capital for such a venture was not likely to attract outside investors.      Colonel Appleyard is apparently still of the opinion that capital will be found for a commercial scale plant on the strength of a guaranteed preference of 8d. for 12 years.
The Committee&apos; s proposal that the Government might, if requested to do so, give financial assistance in connection with approved research work undertaken in connection with a commercial scale plant was put forward &quot;because the Committee felt that it would he desirable to encourage research in certain special directionse     Among these are the method of making the synthesis gas, an examination of the types of coal that could be used in the process, the possibilities of diesel and lubricating oil production, and an examination of the utilisation of the gases for the production of high octane fuels.     what the Committee had in mind was that the Government might usefully spend  100jCOO on such work, the programmes to be approved by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research as being of national interest.If iDrivate enterprise will find the capital for establishing a commercial scale plant there is a good deal to be said in favour of the Committee&apos;s proposal to help on the research side. It remains to be secn3 however, v/hether capital will be forthcoming for the establishment of a plant.The Committee also refer, though in much less detail and   &apos;without recommendation, to the process of Synthetic Oils Limitedwhich is similar in character to the Fischer process.     A plant for this process is under construction in Scotland and isexpected to be completed by July, 1938.     If assistance for research is to be made available in relation to a&apos; British plant for the Fischer process it may be necessary to consider theextension of similar assistance to Synthetic Oils Limited andconceivably to other processes having similar objects, whichmight emerge in the future, if similar considerations arise, dIV, Scottish Shale Oil   Industry.There is little that need be added to what has been said already on this subject under Heading I.The representative of Scottish Oils Limited, who gave
evidence before the Committee, indicated that the possibilities of securing an expansion of the shale oil industry were being actively considered, but the expansion was dependent on the maintenance of a preference of the order now enjoyed, viz., 8d0 a gallon.     This industry at present offers the best possibility of obtaining a home-produced supply of diesel oil in material quantities, a matter of some importance. V, Research,This recommendation again calls for little comment, as there is no indication that the Government is not prepared to continue the work on fuel research to the required extent..,H a C eMines Department10th May, 1938,
ANHEX,Note of Procedure agreed between the Departments concerned for dealing with applications for assistance in erecting low temperature carbonisation plants in the Special Areas.That in view of the facts brought out by the Falmouth Committee that there is no substantial consideration of public interest involved in the development of low temperature carbonisation as a means of producing oil or motor spirit from coal,  the Government is not to be expected to grant any assistance on that account (apart from preference and the assistance already available through the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and referred to in (4) below) to its development outside the Special Areas.     Any such assistance would need legislation.That within the Special Areas any schemes coming forward should be considered on their merits in the same way as industrial developments of any other kino.    If they passed this test the Commissioners for the Special Areas and the Treasury would be able to assist them under existing legislation.The most important form of assistance is the finance which can be found by the Treasury.      The Treasury act on the recommendation of an Advisory Committee.      The Mines Department and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research would, if approached in specific instances, assist the Committee by their advice, the one on the commercial and the other on the technical aspects of particular processes.     The Committee would then be able,after taking into account the prospective employment value of the scheme,  to form an opinion of its attractiveness in connection with Special Areas policy.There was in any event no case for assistance by way of loans from the Treasury under the Special Areas (Amendment) Act to processes which had not evolved beyond the laboratory or semi-commercial stage.      If a laboratory process was sufficiently promising the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research had the necessary authority to help to the stage of proving the technical possibilities of the process:    if a plant exists of such a size that its performance is comparable&apos;with that of a similar plant- operating on a commercial scale,  the Department is empowered to test and report upon the plant free of charge tinder conditions which have been generally published.The Advisory Committee would not recommend, nor would the Treasury give capital help to any business v/hich had not a reasonable chance of ultimate commercial success and this would necessarily involve previous development to the commercial stage.
