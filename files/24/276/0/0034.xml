SIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT, EGRET. COPY NO. 4 6,P. 107(38)CABINET. . UNITED KINuDOM-AUSTRALIAN TRADE. Notejoy the Minister of Health.The notes by the Lord Privy Seal relating to his visit to Australia which have been circulated by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs with Cabinet Paper 96 (33) contain, in section 4, some paragraphs relating to trade.In viev; of the probability that the Australian Ministers now in this country may mention trade questions in conversation with my colleagues during the next few days, I am circulating for information,  in the absence of the President of the Board of Trade, some observations by the Secretary, Department of Overseas Trade, on certain points arising from the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s notes.K.W.Board of Trade,29th April, 1958.
MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF OVERSEAS TRADE.The notes by the Lord privy Seal (CP.96) on his recent visit to Australia include a section on trade, with particular reference to the development of secondary industries.    I think Ministers should be informed on certain points arising therefrom lest there should be any misunderstanding as to our position.The main object of the present visit of Australian Ministers is to negotiate with us a revision of the Ottawa trade agreement of 1932.      Under that Agreement we secured certain safeguards for our export trade in the form (a) of undertakings for the examination and review of protective duties by the Australian Tariff Board in accordance with certain general principles;    (b) of guaranteed margins of preference.    I understand that the Australian Delegation, contrary to the impression which they gave to Lord De La Warr,  intend to seek drastic revision of these safeguard-s and in particular to ask for greatly increased freedom to impose protective duties against United Kingdom goods.    They offer no counter-concessions.    It would be most unfortunate if the impression were&apos;to be created, in advance of the negotiations, that we would find no difficulty in meeting these demands and were,  in fact, willing to do everything possible to encourage the development in Australia of industries competitive with essential branches of our export trade.     Ministers are probably aware that there is more widespread dissatisfaction in this country with regard to the Agreement with Australia than with regard to any other of the Ottawa Agreements;    and that this dissatisfaction arises mainly on account of the attitude of the Commonwealth Government in interpreting their obligations under the Agreement... We ought not,  therefore, to give any indication to Australian Ministers that we are pleased with the working of the Agreement or are likely to he forthcoming in the direction ef
0 ijsatisfying the demands they are going to make on us0I have no wish to imply that secondary industries should not be developed in Australia or that United Kingdom industry should not co-operate intheir development.&apos;    But it is important to distinguish between industries which ares uited to Australian conditions and which have a r easonable chance of establishment on a sound economic basis and industries which can be developed and maintained only behind the shelter of a prohibitive tariff.During the period immediately prior to Ottawa there was a tendency to set up new industries in Australia under cover of excessive protection without any regard to their suitability to Australian conditions.The Tariff Board provisions included in the Ottawa Agreement were designed to check that tendency and thus to safeguard the legitimate interests of our export trade.     The negotiations for revision of the Agreement are not likely to start for some weeks and I am not in a position at this stage to indicate what line we should follow in dealing with the . Australian proposals for revision;    these have not yet been formally submitted and will require careful consideration. But it must clearly be our aim to maintain adequate safeguards for our export trade in any revised agreement and we should be courting disaster if.we encouraged Australian Ministers in the belief that the policy of developing secondary industries, without regard to practical possibilities and without regard to the interests of Australia&apos;s largest market, was one that could receive the wholehearted and unqualified support of the United Kingdom Government.As regards the Australian account of what happened in regard to motor cars and aeroplanes, Ministers will, I am sure, realise that a very different story is available at this end.R.H.28th April,  1938.
