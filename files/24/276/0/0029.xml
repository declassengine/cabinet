254CONFIDENTIAL. A.C._BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL STATS OP TRAPS - MARCH. 1938,Summary of reports submitted &quot;by Members of theBoard of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in somecases with statistical information from other sources). ____i_____-___u__________i___OVERSEAS TRADE.    Imports in March at  84.9 million were  2 million more than in March, 1937;    imports of food, drink and tobacco were  1.8 million more, and raw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured were  0.97 million less. Exports of United Kingdom products,  42.2 million, were  1.3 million less, and re-exports,  5.5 million, were  1.2 million less.RAILWAY TRAFFIC In the 4 weeks ended 27th March railway traffic receipts decreased by  248,000 (2,07$) as compared with the corresponding period of 1937,      The value of passenger traffic decreased by 10.76$;     merchandise, minerals and livestock increased by 5.42$ and coal, coke etc by lo80$.      These comparisons are affected by the incidence of the Easter holidays which fell earlier in 1937 than this year.       As from 1st October last charges were increased by shipping.    There was a further slight fall in tramp shipping freights;    the Chamber of Shipping Index No.   (1935 = 100) was 127.5 compared with 129,5 for February and 158.9 for March,1937. Owners, although reluctant to lay-up vessels, were being compelled to do so and laid-up tonnage on the 1st April was 339,000 tons as compared with 175,000 tons on the 1st January.SHIPBUILDING-.    Shipowners were somewhat hesitant in placing orders and figures for tonnage under construction at 31st March while remaining slightly higher than a year ago show a reduction as compared with the previous quarter.     A number of yards have sufficient naval work, however, to keep them occupied for some time,
255BANKING.   Money continued plentiful throughout the month. The average Treasury Bill tender rate fluctuated &quot;between 9s.llo31d. - 10s,1.54d.    The gold market was active, and the price rose from 139s06;5d. - 140s.5-g-d.    The silver market was firm during most of the month, but later dropped sharply owing to the U.S. Governments refusal to buy Mexican silver. FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD. .BELGIUMa    The belga was under pressure during March, but its range of movement was kept within 29*36 and 29.65.DENMARK.    The year closed with a small budget surplus although expenditure for the year was greatly increased. Foreign trade in February showed a reduction as compared with January.    The Krona remains pegged at 22c40.FRANCE.    Political uncertainty and the recurrence of strikes had a depressing effect on the Bourse.    The franc fluctuated violently falling on March 15th to 167^-; later it improved, and by the end of the month reached 161^.HOLLAND.    The florin rose at one time to 9,00f in terms of sterling mainly owing to withdrawals of refugee capital.    There was little export of domestic capital and the rate closed at 8.96^.    Share quotations showed falls.JAPAN.    Imports exceeded exports in March by 19,000,000 yen. Exports for the first quarter of 1938 were IVfo in value below those of a year ago.U.S .A.   Business continued depressed in spite of a slight seasonal expansion.   Early in the month prices of securities and commodities touched low levels equivalent to those of 1932. The dollar was in demand owing to the influence of the European political situation and touched 4.95 on March 19th. The market quietened later, the closing rate on March 31st being 4,96i*
GOAL.    Production for the 13 weeks ended 26th March showed an increase of 2% as compared with a year before.      Employment in the industry was 4$ higher than in the corresponding period of 1937.      Coal exports for March amounted to 2.97 million tons as compared with 3.04 million tons a year ago.     Shipments increased to Italy, Germany, Egypt and Spain, while exports declined to France, Denmark, Belgium, the Argentine andrPortugal.IRON AND STEEL.      Although markets were quiet, production continued at a relatively high level.      Demand for finished materials was rather irregular and the lighter branches were less well placed for work than the heavy steel makers.      Pig iron output (714,600 tons) was 5 per cent,  greater than in March, 1937.      Eight furnaces ceased operations and two resumed production.      Crude steel output (1,115,800 tons) was slightly more than in March, 1937..     Exports of iron and steel during the first quarter (524,000 tons) were 123,000 tons less than a year before hut the value rose by  1.1 million. Imports (816,000 tons) were 556,000 tons more, due mainly to higher imports of pig-iron and billets, blooms and slabs.ENGINEERING-.      The general recession in activity continued in February and March:    the decline is due almost entirely to a fall in civil demand.     Exports of machinery in March amounted to  5.36 million as compared with  3.&apos;89 million in March,  1937.      Imports ( 2.23 million) were  313,000 more.NON-FERROUS METALS.      Metal prices remained fairly steady except that the price of tin dropped sharply at the end of the month.      Sustained Russian buying supported the markets. United Kingdom demand continued quiet.MOTOR INDUSTRY.      The number of motor vehicles newly registered in February (27,468) was 2,744 less than the year before-.     The decrease in private cars was 3*852.      Sales of commercial vehicles were well maintained.      Production in both
the United States and Canadian automobile industries is well bolow that of a year ago hut production in Germany continues te increase.    Imports of German cars were 2-,339 for January and February as compared with 118 the year before.    The United -Kingdom industry has made progress in the sales of higher, powered cars and heavy commercial and passenger vehicles in overseas markets.ELECTPIPAL INDUSTRY.   Manufacturing activity in recent months has ceased to expand.   At the end of March the volume was slightly below that of March, 1937.   At present however, there are signs of a slightly more confident outlook.    The mild weather has adversely affected sales of some domestic appliances, the increase in units generated was 1*Q% as compared with over 10$ in February and over 13fa for 19KV.    Exports of electrical goods for March ( 1.9 million) wore 88*3$ more than a year ago.COTTON.    The level of production and new business in March was lower than for many years, and there were no signs of re c o ve ry.Stocks were still Increasing and the volume of new orders, was small.    The daily yarn output index was 92 in March (1935 s 100) compared with 117 in March, 1937.    After a slight recovery in February, prices of raw cotton continued to fall during the greater part of March,.Yarn exports at 13*1 m-c lbs. were 3.1 m. lbs. more than in the previous month, but 2d ma lbs. less than in March, 1937.Exports of piece goods at 128.7 m. square yards were 11.5 m. square yards more than in February, but 49.9 m. square yards less than in March, 1937.W0.3L.    There was a further recession in general activity affecting nearly all departments of the woollen and worsted sections.    The decline was most marked in woollen weaving. Machinery activity in February, though slightly higher than in January, remained considerably below a year before.   Exports of tops and yarns in March were higher than in February, but export j of tissues declined.
258HOSIERY.      There was no improvement in any section of the industry, and it was reported that conditions in the underwear section were worse than for t:en years.HIDES AND LEATHER.      There was no sustained improvement in the trade during March.     prices fluctuated hut there was still lack of confidence and in general markets were easier.     Business in most sections of the Leather Industry continued to he restricted.CHEMICALS.      The heavy chemical trade continued to he depressed, although demand was satisfactory in some products. The view is now taken that depressed conditions may continue longer than was anticipated.     Home deliveries of alkalis and chlorine products showed satisfactory increases in March over the previous month, hut sales of dyestuffs were lower than in the first two months of the year, the decline being most marked in the cotton and wool sections of the textile trades.     Export sales of fertilisers increased substantially particularly to Japan,POTTERY.      Employment in February was less than a year before.     The demand for general earthenware and china showed no improvement.     There was some falling off in the demand for tiles and a reduction in home and export sales of sanitary earthenware.      Orders for electrical fittings were Appreciably lower than a year before.BUILDING-.      Employment in March was higher than the year before, but.the figures were affected by the state of the weather when returns were compiled.     Building plans approved by local authorities for the six months ending February, 1938,  showed a decline as compared with the figures for a year ago.     These returns exclude work on Government contracts.
2 e3 9RETAIL TRADE.      The money value of daily retail sales in February was 4.4$ higher than in February, 1937, as compared with an average rise of 7.6% for the preceding 12 months. Sales of food and perishables increased in value by 8.1%; sales of non food merchandise declined by 0.4^.      Preliminary returns for March indicate a substantial decline in daily sales compared with March, 1937, but the incidence of the date of Easter affects the comparison.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE (SCOTLAND).      The trade in the furnishing section remained steady during the past 3 months.     Factories still obtained orders but the prices of certain raw materials tended to fall.      There was a lack of demand in the drapery trade.      Employment in the tailoring factory was very good but allied factories were less active.COLONIAL TRADE.      During the last quarter the course of prices of the commodities exported by the Colonial Empire (such as rubber, tin, vegetable oils and oil seeds, and sisal) was almost uniformly downwards,  markers  being affected by the recession in the U.S.A.      Prospects for British trade in these markets are less favourable.      The cocoa hold-up continued on the Gold Coast and in spite of the withholding of one-third to one-half of the normal world supplies, the price showed little or no improvement.CANADIAN TRADE.      The trend of economic conditions in February was slightly lower than in January.     The index of the volume of business fell from 112 to 106.7.     Exports of zinc, asbestos and nickel decreased after seasonal adjustment!    gold shipments were the highest for any February on record.    Newsprint production was practically maintained after seasonal adjustment and exports of wood pulp and shingles increased.     Activity in the iron and steel and automobile industries declined.
AUSTRALIAN TRAPS.      Bales of wool received into store awing the eight months ended 28th February were 2,601,000 compared with 2,494,000 a year before, quantities sold or shipped being 1,776,000 and 2,077,000 respectively.     Wheat and flourSr tshipments between 1st December and 30th March equivalent to 48.6 bushels compared with 38.4 bushels in the previous year. Butter    exports from the 1st July to 26th March are 71,000 tons compared with 58,000 tons the year before.      Meat exports were the highest since the war.     Imports of merchandise in February amounted to 11.3 million pounds (Australian currency) compared with 7.7 m. pounds in February, 1937.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.     Exports, other than gold, during January were 24.8$ less   and imports 13.8$ more than a year ago.   , The trend in February was similar, exports (except gold) showing a decrease of 20.8$ and imports an increase of 8.9$ as compared with the corresponding month of 1937.     Declines were recorded, in both months, in exports of wool, hides and skins and diamonds, but shipments of fruit, sugar and copper increaser Gold exports in January and February were very substantially higher than a year ago, an increase of more than 100$ being recorded in each month. SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.ARGENTINA.     Exports showed an unfavourable tendency in the first quarter of 1938 and exportable balances for cereals were less than a year ago owing to adverse climatic&apos;conditions. Meat shipments were well maintained and secondary exports were relatively favourable.    For the first two months of 1938, exports were $284.1 million less than a year earlier.     Imports continued at a high level, the total value for January and February being $74.3 million greater than a year earlier. Thus the favourable trade balance for January and February was reduced to $2.7 million compared with $361.1 million the year before.      Imports from the United States, especially in machinery, rose sharply in the first two months of 1938.      The
free peso-sterling rate fell from $16.-8 to $20.10;    the exchange surcharge payable on imports without a &quot;prior permit1&apos;1 was reduced from 20^ to 10$.BRAZIL.     The allocations for Public Debt in the 1938 Budget make it probable that some  2.8 million will be available for service of external loans compared with  24 million necessary for full payment.     The favourable trade balance fell from  9.0 million in 1936 to  1,9 million in 1937. Germany continued to displace the United States as chief supplier to the Brazilian markets.   .  Coffee exports recovered., partially but foreign buyers were still withholding orders in. expectation of lower prices;    the long term statistical position, however,  showed considerable improvement.CHILE.      Total foreign trade for 1937 increased by 52.%. over 1936,  imports being 24^ more and exports 68^ more.      The United States regained from Germany the position of chief supplier.      Imports from the United Kingdom were 3% more than in 1936 and exports to the United Kingdom were considerably more.      There are so far no signs of recession and the outlook remains satisfactory.
