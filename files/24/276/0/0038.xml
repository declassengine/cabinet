(THIS document IS  THE PRCPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET . Copy No . . . W.Hfi .. &apos;CABINET.CP.  Ill   (33)BAKEHOUSES    BILL. (Baking Industry  (Hours of Work) Bill)..Memorandum by trie Home Secretary.This Bill was considered by the Cabinet on the 16th March with reference to my Memorandum CP.62(38), when it was decided that the Government should reserve freedom of action in Committee Stage while lending assistance towards making the Bill a workable measure,  and should if necessary review the position again after the Committee Stage had been concluded.The Bill has now been reported from Committee and the . Report Stage is expected to be taken on Friday,  the 13th instant, (it will not be Pirst Order on the Paper but appears likely to be reached fairly early in the day).      The Bill has been so materially changed in Committee that I suggest that the Government should reconsider its previous attitude.It became apparent at an early stage of the proceedings in Committee that there was a strong feeling among Members on both sides that if possible some compromise should be reached which would enable the Bill to go forward, and after much informal discussion the Bill has been extensively recast.      It is not now a Bill to prohibit night work subject to some exceptions to be granted by the Secretary of State but, as the change in the long title shows, rather a Bill to restrict and regulate night work.     In substance the Bill provides that employment at night, ive. , between 11 p,m. and 5 a.m., may only take place to the extent and subject to the conditions authorised under one of three systems.      Under the first system employment throughout the night is permissible, but no individual may be employed in the factory on more than five nights in the
week  (as compared with, the  six nightb men usually work at present).      Under the second system the workpeople may he employed on -Friday night and after 4 o&apos;clock (instead of 5) on other mornings,     Under the third system men.may he employed at night on alternating shift systems so arranged that no individual works at night in more than half the number of weeks. Then there is a further very important new feature relative to the coming into operation of the Act,     In effect, the Bill now provides that if a Trade Board has been established before the 1st January,  1940,  the Act shall not come into operation without positive resolutions from both Houses, who would have before them the considered views, of the Trade Beard,The various amendments to give effect to these new proposals were moved by Mr, McCorquodale who t with my approval.1., was assisted by Parliamentary Counsel in framing a workable scheme on the lines of the compromise which the parties appeared to desire;  . and they were accepted by all sides without a Division.The Bill in its new form is not entirely acceptable to all classes of bakers nor can it be said to have the official support of the Master Bakers&apos; Association.     On the other hand the changes go far to meet the views of master bakers and the amended Bill will no doubt meet with a large measure of support both in the House and outside,I should have preferred that there should have been no legislation on the matter until the Trade Board has been set up and has had an opportunity of considering it, iC-Z this apparently is still the offioial attitude of the Master Bakers&apos; Association; but seeing that the amendments made.,  together with the inclusion of the above mentioned safeguard as to its coming into operation, meet to a very large extent the criticisms of the Bill as originally introduced3  and having,&quot; regard&apos; to the
large measure of agreement reached,  I do not think that the Government ought to oppose the Bill further.In all the circumstances I suggest that the Government, while not going so far as to treat the Bill as  -entirely acceptable,   should take the line that it has been greatly improved in Committee and that they will not offer any further opposition to its proceeding through its remaining stages in substantially its present form.S . H.6th May,  1938 .
