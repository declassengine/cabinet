The Cabinet at their meeting on 14th March had under consideration the possibility of further Defence Measures (Cabinet 13 (38) Item 3).    The Secretary of State for Air submitted a plan under which a first-line bomber strength of 1,320 and a fighter strength of 544 aeroplaneswith a total metropolitan first-line strength of 2,182 machines would be provided by March, 19390    Pull reserves approximately would be provided by March, 1940.    These results were only possible if labour and materials were forthcoming. This plan has become known as Scheme L and was intended to be an acceleration of Scheme K (CP. 65 (38))*    The Cabinet came to no conclusion as to approving Scheme K or the accelerationJcnown as Scheme L.    I was, however, directed to investigate further the proposals of the Secretary of State for Air in consultation with him and the Minister of Labour.2. -   Later in the same day, 14th March, an examinationof the proposals of the Secretary of State for Air was made in accordance with the Cabinet direction.    It was stated that Scheme K would cost  567 million,,    Discussion took place as to labour requirements and the necessity for further capacity.    I have since besn furnished with the details of labour require-ments.    Meanwhile the secretary of state for Air has been
w   102preparing to carry out his plan for acceleration^ (Scheme L) on the assumption that it would receive Cabinet approvals&apos;3o On 11th March-I had in connection with my review of.-       -     &quot;   - . -defence expenditure asked the Secretary.of State for Air to draw up his programme on the basis of certain, provisional allocations to his Department over the next four yearss Similar letters were sent to the First Lord and the Secretary of State for War and it was proposed to hold an early meeting of the Defence Ministers to discuss the various allocations of the total sum available fixed by the Cabinet at  1,570 million.,    Meanwhile the events took place in Europe which led to the discussion at the Cabinet on 14th March above referred to0.   . .-4c - On 29th March I wrote to each of the defence ministers making certain suggestions with a view to preventing misunderstanding as to the effect of acceleration on the measures in progress for bringing expenditure within the total of  1,570 million,,    In a &quot;reply dated 30th March the Secretary of State for Air asked for a clear understanding as to the plan to which he was to work and suggested that this should be Scheme L, first-line strength plus the reserves put forward under K*    I now submit the programme of the Secretary of State for Air for a decision by the Cabinet^A memorandum prepared by the secretary of State for Air fully explaining his proposals is annexed05c At the Cabinet Meeting on 14th March I said that theadoption of Scheme K would wreck the scheme recently adopted iby the Cabinet after consideration of my further Report on expenditure,    I am satisfied that this is the case, assuming that the total sum available is  1,570 million.    Scheme L as,&apos; -      .
stated in the annexed memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air in fact goes a little beyond a mere acceleration of Shcme/K. This fact still further increases the difficulty amounting to impossibility of bringing Scheme L within the Cabinet decision on defence expenditure.    On the other hand the view taken by the Secretary of State for Air on the advice of the Air Staff that Scheme K which it is proposed to accelerate and slightly increase as Scheme L is necessary to provide a safe Air defence against Germany.    I am not in a position to contest this view.    If, however, the Cabinet accept it, it will be necessary to add whatever sum is necessary for this purpose to the  1,570 million.    If on the other hand Scheme K as accelerated is not approved on the score of finance, the Air Ministry will be required to prepare proposals which fall below the level of safety, as viewed by the Air Staff.    I should regret very much any decision which threw into the melting pot the whole question of defence expenditure.    It is important in my submission to maintain the Cabinet&apos;s decision as far as at all possible.    The addition above proposed in a certain event will not I hope, if approved, be regarded as reopening the cabinet&apos;s decision as to the sum available. The provisional allocations to the defence departments will still have to be settled on the basis of the sum already approved together with any addition involved in the approval of the present proposals of the Secretary of state for Air.(infld) T. W.  H.   1*tehall Gardens, 8. W. 1. t April, 1938,
I Should remind the Cabinet that Scheme K, which was put forward by the Air Ministry and dealt with in-D.P.  (P) 16, was based as regards first-line strength on the minimum response which the Air Staff advises it would be safe to maice to Germany, on known German intentions of expansion.      It must, however, be remembered that this first-line strength could not in normal con-ditions be attained with personnel and reserves until 1941, while the corresponding German expansion will be complete by the end of 1938.     Moreover, Scheme K provided for reserves on a scale lower than the Air staff considered necessary to enable the Air Force to operate fully during the period, vrtiich must necessarily elapse before war production could reach a scale to keep pace with wastage.The programme is based on the assumption that the labour will be forthcoming which is necessary to achieve the maximum of acceleration possible.     Broadly, it may be said that the aircraft industry,  including . the shadow factories, has been extended and equipped on a scale which will take very large reinforcements of labour.Detailed figures have been supplied by the industry and the Air Ministry showing as nearly as con be estimated the amount and character of the labour required, and the approximate dates at which it could be absorbed in the different works.      I need not go into details, but the total reinforcement ultimately required is in the region of 100,000.ANNEX.
Assuming the labour is forthcoming as required, both in numbers and in time, it should he possible to accelerate the Air Force programme in the manner shown in the attached table.It will be seen that on this assumption by the 31st March 1940 we should achieve a metropolitan first-line strength of 2,373 aircraft with reserves on the scale envisaged under Scheme K.     This would enable us to bring the programme forward by a year during the period up to 31st March 1940.      The Air Staff should be authorised to utilise personnel and aircraft in the manner which in their opinion will conduce best to the efficiency and war readiness of the Force as a whole.      I lay stress on the importance of the Air Staff being accorded this general discretion, because I feel that while every effort must he made to secure the most rapid rate possible of output of aircraft and intake of personnel, it is vital that these should he used by the Air Staff to maintain, throughout this dangerous period, the most effective fighting force possible. During the third year, the process of re-equipment of part of the Force would he carried out as envisaged under scheme K, but at an earlier date.     Broadly, therefore, assuming the labour can he provided,* we should he able to accelerate the programme by .at least a year.It is necessary to give a general authority for the full programme, because the effect of acceleration (achieved not only by double shifts but also by expansion of capacity where practicable) will he to bring existing contracts to an end more quickly, and therefore necessitate an early placing of new orders to avoid gaps in production.
Ip  therefore, propose that the Air Ministry should he authorised to enter into contracts during the course of the current financial year which will cover the whole scheme.     But in all aircraft contracts they will, of course, include the break clause,  to enable such contracts to be terminated or reduced if the international situation permits.It is a necessary corollary of this recommendation that the Air Ministry should have authority for the personnel and works required to keep pace with this acceleration, and to increase their building programme and their recruiting programme to keep pace with the accelerated output of aircraft.I ought to explain that there is a slight dis-crepancy between the figures set out in the table and the figures in scheme K.      It will be seen that there is a slight increase in fighter first-line strength.     This is due to the fact that although the number of Squadrons remains the same (38), it has been found strategically and tactically desirable to increase the strength of a Fighter Squadron from 14 to 16*I think the best estimate of cost I can give remains of the order of  567 million over five years as set out inparagraph 28, D.P.  (P)  16*      I give this figure withreserve because I feel that it is almost impossible at this moment to estimate with precision the cost of acceleration.There may be some increase in works expenditure and personnelcost on the Service side.     On the supply side there will be van extra labour cost in working a double shift:    on the other hand there should be a set off against this by over-head charges being more widely spread, and by contracts
covering a larger number of machines of the same type than would have been the case under a programme taking the five years to complete.     At the same time,  it will, of course, be realised that a far larger proportion of the total expenditure will fall to be borne in the earlier years of the programme.
