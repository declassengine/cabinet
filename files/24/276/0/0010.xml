THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   March 1938.SECRET. - Cob/&apos;&quot;&apos;No. 43COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Draft Minutes of the 316th Meeting, held on March 31, 1938.(1)-PROTECTION OF RESERVES OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.(OLD. Papers Nos. 1414-B and 1413-B.)(Previous reference :  OLD. Minutes of the 300th Meeting, Minute 2.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence on the Protection of Reserves of Petroleum Products (OLD. Paper No. 1414-B); also a Memorandum by the Oil Board on the building up of civil oil stocks to three months&apos; rationed level (OLD. Paper No. 1413-B).SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that his Memorandum arose out of the anxiety expressed by the Committee of Imperial Defence as to the safety of the oil reserves in process of accumulation by the oil companies and the security of oil stocks generally. The approval of his proposals would represent a further step towards alleviating that anxiety. Civil oil stocks had been under consideration for the past two years, and the measures which would be necessary to bring reserve stocks to the three months&apos; level recommended.by the Committee of Imperial Defence were put forward in the Memorandum by the Oil Board (OLD. Paper No. 1413-B).Part 2 of his Memorandum showed that the new tankage in the Thames area was in substitution of tankage previously hired at Thameshaven. Para-graph (6) on page 2 showed what was being done by the Oil Companies to build up their stocks to three months&apos; normal consumption. The Shell-Mex and B.P. Group would have completed their programme in about a month&apos;s time, but the Anglo-American Company were waiting for the proposed amendment to the Petroleum Bye-law to be confirmed before proceeding with their scheme for tankage at Purfleet.Part 3 of the Memorandum dealt with the different types of protected storage. The type described as Type II would provide protection against light incendiary bombs and anything except direct hits from heavy bombs.. Its cost would be about  4 a ton. Underground storage to give complete protection against a 25 lb. bomb would&apos;&apos;cost as much as  9 a ton. The Shell-Mex and B.P. Group were prepared to consult the Mines Department on the details of all new schemes, and similar arrangements should be made with other companies operating on a substantial scale. He would like to see a general principle, placed on record, that all oil stocks should henceforward be placed in protected storage.In raising their stocks to the level equivalent to three months&apos; normal consumption the companies considered they were going as far as could be expected at their own expense, and he concurred with the Secretary of Mines that this position should be accepted. The question then arose as to what could be done to implement the decision of the Committee of Imperial Defence. The figures which were given in the Oil Board Memorandum (OLD. Paper No. 1413-B) were based on the provisional assumption that only 55.per cent, of stocks should be regarded as relatively secure. The estimated cost of making good the shortage in above-ground tankage was  4,100,000, and he recommended that a scheme should now be drawn up and commenced for a total expenditure of  1-1 million. This, he added, Avas a purely arbitrary figure. He had also recommended that protected tankage of Type II should be accepted, and that the whole reserve should be in Area B. It would be necessary for the scheme to be worked out in consultation with the oil companies, as their assistance would be needed in its execution., .      [16980-1]    - , &apos;
2- SIR SAMUEL 110ARE said that the Report revealed a most disturbing situation. The Shell Mex and IIP. Company had installed a considerable amount of unprotected storage in the last six or seven months. Their programme was practically complete, and it was too late now for protective measures to be taken. From the poin^of view of air raid precautions it was slightly,less vulnerable than -previous storage in that it was dispersed to a greater extent, but it was most unfortunate that these increases had been made without the protection which the Home Office felt was absolutely essential, and which they had been advocating for many months. The Anglo-American Oil Company had held up their plans with a view to installing protected tankage as soon as the amendment to the bye-law was confirmed. He suggested that it was not only desirable but vitally important, that oil stocks should be placed in protected storage.LORD HALIFAX wondered whether the steps taken by the Shell Mex and B.P. Company were the result of a failure of liaison between Departments or whether they were taken before the policy was decided.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that, as a result of representations from the Secretary for Mines, the main companies had undertaken to increase their stocks to three months&apos; normal consumption. The Shell Mex and B.P. Company were, just about to complete this undertaking. There had been no engagement to provide protected storage.SIR ALFRED FAULKNER added that the Oil Companies had undertaken to put as much as possible of their increased reserve in Area B. He added that the Service Departments were laying down unprotected storage in that Area, and it did not seem consistent to press the Companies to go further than the Service Departments.LORD HALIFAX said that it appeared that the standard of safety considered necessary had altered. He thought that in the future whatever steps were necessary for the security of oil reserves must be taken.SIR THOMAS INSKIP pointed out that the Government had no compulsory -powers.   Fie agreed with Sir Alfred Faulkner that it would be difficult to press the Companies to go further ,of their own free will than the Service Departments.SIR SAMUEL HOARE remarked that the Service Departments were pro-viding protected storage for a proportion of their reserves, and he suggested that the Companies might be pressed to do likewise.SIR MAURICE HANKEY remarked that there was no fixed proportion for each Service; the War Office, for instance, were relying on dispersion.SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested that, as the Anglo-American Company were installing protected storage at their own expense at Purfieet, the other Companies might do likewise if the bye-law was altered.SIR ALFRED FAULKNER pointed out that the Anglo-American Oil Company anticipated saving on their cost of distribution more than the extra cost of the protected storage. -It was, in fact, an essentially business proposition for them.; SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that a suggestion for the amendment of the bye-law had been turned down ten years ago, but circumstances had altered a good deal, and though certain additional risks would be entailed if the bye-law was altered, the advantages of the Anglo-American Company&apos;s scheme, which depended upon the amendment of the bye-law, justified the acceptance of these risks. As a result of a great deal of negotiation with local authorities and other interests, the proposed amendment had now been published, and it was hoped that ^t would be confirmed in about three weeks&apos; time.&apos; ! As regards other Companies installing protected storage, it must be remem-bered that without statutory powers traders could not be compelled to do things at their own expense. The lesson to be learned was that it was necessary to be more particular than in the past in making representations to the Oil Companies.&apos; SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that, though he did not here and now suggest that compulsory powers should be taken, he thought they would eventually benecessary: ,UVV7 :vy,policy,&amp;.:h.i&amp;&amp; Sl:UlilA-respect Lll ii-li^i if-, &apos;Si.(J::l ;-;SIR ALFRED FAULKNER raised a point in connection with the installa-tion of any new storage at Government expense.  The scheme for the distribution
of imports had shown that there was a necessity for additional tankage in the West; and in the event, therefore, of the diversion of traffic to West coast ports, tankage in the West would be more valuable than in the Eastern districts of the&apos;country. . *  ^ . &apos;y--&quot;:-yAs regards the taking of compulsory powers, the Government in the past had successfully helped Companies to resist demands in both Japan and Germany that they should lay in war stocks at their own expense. If compulsory powers were taken in this country, parallel action was sure to be taken abroad.LORD SWINTON thought that the possibility of foreign reactions might be over-rated. He thought that the Government had a strong claim on the Companies. They were admirably placed in peace-time, and in war they knew that they would have the Government behind them; in fact, it might be said that they had a greater degree of insurance for their continued commercial activity in war-time than anyone else. He thought that we should concentrate on the proposal put forward by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to lay down additional stocks at Government expense, while pressing the Companies as far as possible to lay down protected storage at their own expense.Mr. BRUCE asked how urgent the matter was. If air raids came to-morrow and the position was that all Oil supplies could be wiped out, it seemed to him that a decision must be made to take whatever steps were necessary to improve the position, irrespective of commercial or other reactions.SIR ALFRED FAULKNER pointed out that, in conjunction with the work which was being done by the Oil Companies for the Service Departments, it was probable that the present proposals would absorb all available tank-building capacity for the next two years.LORD SWINTON deplored that it should take so long. He felt sure that, if the country were at war, and Ave concentrated on the building of tanks, the programme could be completed in a shorter time. He suggested -that the Service Departments, in consultation with the Mines Department, should exert all possible pressure to accelerate matters.SIR SAMUEL HOARE remarked that the Anglo-American Company had estimated that, as soon as the amendment to the bye-law was confirmed, they could complete their tankage at Purfleet Avithin a year.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that, from his discussions with representa-tives from the Oil Companies, he was sure the time could be cut down.SIR ALFRED FAULKNER asked whether the Mines Department should concentrate on the &quot;accumulation of the more dangerous materials, petrol and kerosene, and omit fuel oil.SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested, and the Committee agreed, that reserves should be built up in the proportion of 70 per cent, motor spirit, and 30 per cent, fuel oil. ,SIR JOHN SIMON, referring to the proposed expenditure of  1^ million, suggested that this was not a restrictive figure, but as much as could usefully be made the basis of a scheme at the present time. When the scheme had been completed the position could be reviewed. &apos;SIR THOMAS INSKIP suggested that Cabinet approval should be sought for an expenditure of  1^ million on a scheme of Type II tankage to be built as rapidly as possible, the tanks to be filled as soon as they were ready, the cost of the oil being additional to the scheme. He added that this expenditure would come out of the  20 million which had been set aside for passive defence measures.LORD DE LA WARR suggested that the Oil Board should be instructed to consider whether a scheme costing more than  1^ million could not be implemented equally quickly. He assumed that the Oil Board were to work on the accelerated basis desired by the Cabinet, and asked that this might be put on record. rr;, SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested that the question of transport should be borne in mind, especially in the light of the possibility of the diversion of imports.SIR ALFRED FAULKNER said that this question was being dealt with by. another Sub-Committee. , &quot;  t      &quot; .-. .
LORD DE LA WARR asked whether the principle of protection for oil-stocks was to be applied to Service as well as to Civil reserves.SIR THOMAS IN&apos;SKIP suggested that the Service Departments should consider the matter and report.SIR MAURICE HANKEY suggested that the Secretary for Mines might be asked to report on the question of compulsory powers.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the nature of the compulsion would clearly be that no one would be at liberty to store oil of more than a certain quantity without licence. The difficulty would be in laying down the conditions for the granting of the licences.SIR ALFRED FAULKNER added that the effects of legislation on the cost to the consumer would have to be borne in mind. He undertook to arrange for a report to be prepared on the whole aspect of compulsory powers.LORD SWINTON suggested that the Service procedure was the logical one with regard to oil storage in general, namely, that in Area A the whole of the supplies should be protected, and in Area B a certain proportion.SIR MAURICE HANKEY suggested and the Committee agreed that the Minutes of the discussion and the conclusions reached should be forwarded for the information of the Cabinet.Conclusions.&quot;The Committee oe Imperial Defence agreed:   .(a) That subject to approval by the Cabinet, a scheme for the installation of Protected Tankage for Civil Oil Reserves should be drawn up and commenced on the basis of an expenditure of  1^ millions.(b) That the &quot; protected tankage&quot; as contemplated in (a) above should be &apos;      Type II protection, viz. :-4,000-ton pressure tanks with Concrete sides and roofs, earth top cover and earth side fillings to normal slopes.(c) That the tankage as completed should be filled with petroleum productsat a cost additional to the  l-g millions mentioned in (a) above, on the basis of 70 per cent, motor spirit and kerosene, and 30 per cent, fuel oil. ,(d) That, as a general principle, it is of vital importance that oil stocks for civil and industrial purposes should be placed in protected storage of the type defined in (&amp;) above.(e) That the Service Departments should consider and report to what extent the principle laid down in (d) above should apply to their reserves.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   March 1938.SECRET. Copy Nol 11414-B.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.THE POSITION IN REGARD TO CIVIL OIL STOCKS. (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1413-B.)Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.1. Introduction.WHEN, on the 20th January last, the Committee of Imperial Defence* had before them the Interim Report of the Sub-Committee on the Protection of Vital Services (C.I.D. Paper No. 276-A), anxiety was expressed as to the safety of the oil reserves in.process of accumulation by the Oil Companies, and the security of civil oil stocks generally. It was agreed that, in consultation with the Secretary for Mines, I should arrange to see the heads of the Oil Companies with a view to the adoption of better arrangements for the storage of civil oil reserves, and should report back to the Committee of Imperial Defence.The Secretary for Mines and I have had conversations with Mr. Fraser and Mr. Godber of the Shell-Mex and B.P. Company (representing the Anglo-Iranian and Shell Oil Companies), in which, on the one hand, we have emphasised the vulnerability of oil stocks and their national importance, and oh the other ascertained more definitely their views on the extent of the contribution which the Companies should make in the interests of national security. I have not myself approached the Anglo-American Company or the smaller Companies in the oil trade. The Secretary for Mines is in constant touch with these concerns and will continue the work already in hand as described below. I have added in Section 5 of this memorandum some observations on the question of building up a Govern-ment reserve of oil products, which is dealt with in the memorandumt of the Oil Board covering a memorandum of the Sub-Committee on Petroleum Products Reserves.2. Recent Developments in Oil Storage.The Committee of Imperial Defence were apprehensive that the present unsatisfactory disposition of oil stocks, resulting from their growth in the $ast in large, concentrations in dock areas, was being aggravated by the erection of further unprotected tankage adding to the density especially in the Thames Estuary.The following are particulars of tankage recently erected and proposed to be erected by the Oil Companies (a) to meet their commercial requirements; and (&amp;) to implement the undertakings which they have given to the Secretary for Mines to build up their stocks to the level equivalent to three months&apos; normal consumption.(a) it*has hitherto been the practice of the Companies to hold substantial quantities of oil in the storage installations at Thames Haven of the London and Thames Haven Oil Wharves, Limited; for commercial reasons they have been terminating this arrangement arid erecting storage of their own. elsewhere. In accordance with the new policy the Shell-Mex and B.P. group have erected 56,000 tons of tankage of improved type for motor spirit in the Isle of Grain, and 33,000 tons at Shell Haven which adjoins Thames Haven. The Anglo-American * C.I.D./307th Meeting, Minute 2. f C.I.D. Paper No.&quot; i4i3-B.[16919] - ft;&quot;
2Company are proposing to erect 127,000 tons of protected storage at Purfleet, a large proportion of which is to -be in substitution for tankage now hired at Thames Haven; this scheme is held up pending the proposed alteration of the Port of London by-law. I gather that unless some unexpected new opposition appears the alteration will be made within the next month or six weeks. The Company has other schemes in hand to supplement their stocks.Another scheme is that of Trinidad Leaseholds, a smaller Company which has contemplated putting 80,000 tons on the Medway mainly in substitution for existing stocks at Coryton, another storage depot near to Thames Haven. The Company have, at the request of the Departments, deferred the commencement of this scheme; the tankage and the plans generally are now being reconsidered.The general result of this policy is not to increase the stocks in the Thames Estuary, but to some extent to disperse them, which is in itself an improvement. (b) The programme of the Shell-Mex and B.P. group for building up their stocks to the level equivalent to three months&apos; normal consumption will be completed in April. Their additional tankage for this purpose will be as follows : For motor spirit 20,000 tons at Hamble, in Area A, and 39,000 tons at a variety of depots in Area B; for fuel oil a total of 87,700 tons, of which 51,700 tons are in Area A.The Anglo-American Company stated that on the basis of stocks at the end of June 1937, the additional quantities which they required to bring their stocks up to the three months&apos; level were 59,000 tons of motor spirit and 101,500 tons of fuel oils. This would involve new tankage of about 75,000 tons and 125,000 tons respectively. For motor spirit they are erecting 24,000 tons of tankage in Area A and 65,000 in Area B. Part of these erections may represent normal expansion. In the case of fuel oil tankage their plans have not yet made much progress. Up to the present 3,300 tons have been allocated to Area A and 2,900 tons to Area B. The position of the Company is compli-cated by their large bunkering business, which is subject to wide fluctuations over short periods, and negotiations are proceeding between the Mines Department and the Company in this regard.It is particularly important to make early arrangements for the storage of the reserve to be laid down by the Anglo-American Company. The Mines Department are also negotiating with several other Companies next in order of importance in regard to their programmes.The Mines Department will ask all Companies carrying on business on any substantial scale for undertakings that they will not erect further tankage without consulting them. They will then examine each case, on the lines set out below, with a view to introducing greater security than has been provided in accordance with commercial practice hitherto.3. Measures to improve the Security of Oil Stocks.The most urgent task is to install reasonable passive precautions in existing installations. The Mines Department are now examining possible methods of passive defence in consultation with the Oil Companies and a representative of the Home Office. In the first instance these measures should ensure against fires spreading or damage otherwise being caused by the outflow of oil to adjacent property or waterways. They should, however, lead on to wider measures within the installations to restrict the damage to tankage and the consequent Joss of stocks. The Mines Department will report as soon as possible through the Oil Board. These precautions must be expected to involve the Companies in Considerable expense as well as to make demands on their labour for some time to come.  It may be that the question of Government assistance will arise.It is probably true that no above-ground tankage can be regarded as secure, especially in the more vulnerable areas. By taking passive precautions and reducing the density of installations, losses may be restricted. On the other hand, to provide protected tankage involves considerably higher expense. The Oil Bo^rd has considered various types of protected tankage and concluded that
a reasonable degree of security would be afforded by 4,000-ton pressure tanks with concrete sides and roofs, earth top cover and earth side fillings to normal slopes. This tankage referred to as Type Il^-can in suitable places be partially sunk in a hillside and then covered to&apos;conform to the slope of the ground. In other cases it would appear as a grass-covered mound. It would afford&apos;protection against light incendiary bombs, and anything except direct hits from heavy bombs. The cost is about  4 8s. a ton, as compared with about  2 10s. a ton for commercial tankage of the most up-to-date pattern hitherto used. Under-ground tankage to give complete concealment and protection against a 25-lb. bomb would cost about  9 a ton.The Companies have hitherto taken the view that these costs of protected or underground storage are higher than is warranted by commercial requirements; they add, moreover, that, if they incurred them in this country, they would be expected to do the same abroad. I think that, in the immediate future, schemes must be considered individually in the light of local conditions. Some additional security can be given, in the lay-out of installations, by a wider spacing of tanks, making use of natural features so as to render them less conspicuous and arranging tanks having regard to the probable direction of air attack. Such measures are likely to involve additional expense, but as a general rule they do not go far enough. Consideration should be given to the possibility of siting-installations some distance from the ports, involving the use of pipe lines. It may be possible to devise schemes similar to that of the Anglo-American Company at Purneet, which provides tankage approximating to Type II, but at an estimated cost of  3 15.?. a ton, and is regarded as a commercial proposition as the higher cost&quot; of construction is offset by the lower cost of distribution. On other schemes of this kind facilitated by the local terrain, part of the compensating advantage in distribution may be obtainable.Mr. Fraser and Mr. Godber assured me that their group wrould be prepared to Consult the Mines Department on the details of all new schemes. The same arrangement should be made with other Companies operating on a substantial scale. As a general principle, it is desirable that oil stocks should henceforward be placed in protected storage; the Mines Department will press all Companies as far as possible to install protected tankage, suitable to the local circumstances, at their own expense. I do not think that we can as yet decide definitely upon any permanent standards of storage or methods of introducing or enforcing them.The security of oil stocks, however, depends on their distribution over the country as well as on the tankage and local dispersal. It is inevitable that oil stocks should be concentrated in or near the deep-water ports, which can accommodate the large ocean-going tankers; this system actually provides for the rapid discharge of tankers, a matter of major importance in time of war. The quantities in each area are determined&apos;by the commercial demand, from which it follows that the largest stocks are in the Thames Estuary. Elsewhere the largest concentrations are, in order of magnitude, on the Mersey, at Swansea, Southampton, Avonmouth, Humber and Grangemouth. It may be possible for the Companies, as they build further tankage in future to provide for increasing consumption, to stretch their commercial practice by giving a preference wherever possible to Western Ports. Mr. Fraser and Mr. Godber have assured me that this is the intention of their group.It must be borne in mind that much of the existing tankage in the country-is out of date in its spacing, &amp;c., compared with the best contemporary practice, but as it suffices for ordinary use the Companies would not in the normal course replace it. I doubt whether it is possible to press a general programme of replace-ment of existing storage upon the Companies. It would involve very heavy expense, and would take many years to carry through. For the present at any rate their available resources might be put to&apos;better use, yielding quicker results, in other Svays. But the question depends on the efficiency of the methods which can be adopted for the protection of existing depots, and I think that the desirability of replacing some of the existing tankage should be further considered when the investigations into passive precautions are more advanced.4. Commercial Stocks.It has been the opinion of the Mines Department, which has been accepted by the Oil Board, that in raising their stocks to the level equivalent to three months&apos; normal consumption *;he Companies are building them as hio-h as can [16919] r 2 &quot;
be expected at their own expense. Stocks of this size, as Mr. Fraser and Mr. Godber informed me, are the maximum, or even more than the maximum, consistent with commercial requirements. The cost to the Companies of the additional stocks and of the tankage is estimated by the Mines Department to be of the order of  2^ millions. But it is more than a matter of cost. The Companies believe that, if it became known abroad that they had exceeded in the United Kingdom the level of commercial practice, their position would be prejudiced, i.e., they could no longer maintain against the pressure of foreign Governments that their functions should be limited to meeting commercial requirements.This is a factor peculiar to the Oil Companies. I concur in the opinion of the Secretary for Mines that the position should be accepted. Mr. Fraser and Mr. Godber informed me that, in the event of the Government deciding to lay in stocks of oil, their group would be willing not only to assist in carrying out the scheme, but to undertake so far as possible as part of their operations the care of the stocks and any necessary turning over, assuming that the units are located in the neighbourhood of their depots. I assume that it would be possible to obtain the assistance of the other more important Companies in the same way.5. Desirability of creating a Reserve of Oil Products.   &apos;The Committee of Imperial Defence have had before them on previous occasions the question of building up at Government expense a reserve of oil products. On the 28th October last* they invited the Oil Board to formulate proposals, to implement the previous recommendation of the Committee of Imperial Defence that three months&apos; &quot;relatively secure&quot; stocks on a rationed basis should be held, on the provisional assumption that in present circumstances only 55 per cent, of total stocks can be regarded as &quot; relatively secure,&quot; The estimates are given in the enclosure to OLD. Paper 1413-B. If may assist my colleagues if I offer some observations on this matter.The danger arises mainly from the fact that the greater proportion of oil ^stocks (87 per cent.) is held in the ocean installations. About 45 per cent, of total stocks are held in these installations in Area A. As, however, the range of aircraft increases, less reliance can be placed on concentrations in above-ground tanks in Area B.Allowing for some progressive improvement in future in methods of storage, I thiiik it is inevitable that in general oil stocks will have a relatively high degree of vulnerability. Apart from the possibility of a temporary interruption of imports, we must assume that the large concentrations would be chosen as objectives of air attack. I think that the risks are too heavy, and I recommend that the Government should reinforce the position by laying in a reserve.If this view is accepted in principle, the amount of the reserve must be considered in relation to the other calls on our resources. As shown in C.I.D, Paper 1413-B, taking the year 1940, the shortages, on the assumption that 55 per cent, of total stocks can be regarded as &quot; relatively secure,&quot; and the estimated cost of making them good in above-ground tankage are : Tons.   million. 275,000 2-4250,000 1-450,000 -34 if protected storage of Type II is adopted for motor spirit and kerosene, the additional cost would be  600,000. v The hypotheses, however, on Which the calculations have been made, areinevitably arbitrary. It is, not necessary to settle immediately a final scheme. No doubt it is easier to plan knowing the full objective, but it is only practicable to go by stages. I recommend that a scheme should now be drawn up and commenced within a total expenditure of  1-5 millions. I suggest the following as considerations to be borne in mind.&apos; * O.T.D./300th Meeting, Minute 2. :Motor spirit ... Fuel oil Kerosene
A reserve of this character should in principle be given the highest degree of security. In view, however, of the long time required to install underground storage as well as the heavy cost, I suggest that protected tankage of Type II should be generally accepted.   All the reserve should be in Area B.It is desirable to pro-vide as wide dispersal as practicable. This definitely precludes location in dock areas in close proximity to the existing coastal installations. On the other hand there is advantage in having the tankage so sited that it can be refilled rapidly. It will be remembered that one of the reservations to the practicability of the scheme for the diversion of shipping, out-lined in the Report of the Sub-Committee on the Distribution of Imports in Time, of War (C.I.D. Paper No. 252-A), concerned the very large shortage of tankage outside the danger area. This is an important matter in the problem of maintaining supplies. It may be possible to ease this situation by siting the new tankage a few miles from oil docks, connected thereto by pipe-lines.The fact that the shortages have been calculated on the basis of rationed stocks implies that consumption which is not essential has already been eliminated. Detailed examination should, however, be given to questions of priority, as between one product and another, according to its use and the present level of stocks. It may also be desirable to plan at this stage a greater proportion of the expenditure on tankage than on oil, since greater time, is taken in providing tankage than filling it.Assuming that in time of war the supply and distribution of oil would be controlled by the Government, the reserve would be regarded as a general ultimate reserve for all purposes. In planning it some account should be taken of the disposition of the reserves which are being provided for the Services. For instance, the plans for the location of the 70,000 tons of motor spirit in the War Office reserve, this being the balance for which arrangements have not yet been completed, and the plans for the civil reserve should be co-ordinated.It will be necessary for the scheme to be worked out in consultation with the Oil Companies. Their assistance will be needed in its execution, but it should be laid down that the work should not be allowed to interfere with the work which they are doing on behalf of the Air Ministry. The Oil Board at their last meeting-agreed that, in view of the paramount importance of expediting as much as possible the accumulation of the reserve of aviation spirit for the Royal Air Force, the Air Ministry should be given priority as regards the use of the technical staffs of the Oil Companies. The Oil Companies should be pressed to undertake the care of the stocks and any necessary turning over without repayment. As stated above, I anticipate that they will be willing to do this.If the Committee of Imperial Defence approve a scheme on these lines, the Secretary for Mines and I will make the necessary arrangements for the preparation of detailed plans.(Initialled)      T.

(209)) as to the quantity of civil stocks which is to be assumed to be &quot; relatively secure,&quot; the Oil Board set out the position and asked the Committee of Imperial Defence for instructions on the question (O.B. 217).*2. The memorandum by the Oil Board was considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their 300th meeting, held on the 28th October, and the following conclusion! was reached, inter alia: (a) That the Oil Board should be authorised to formulate proposals to implement the recommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence that three months&apos; &quot; relatively secure &quot; stocks on a rationed basis should be held on the provisional assumption that, in present circumstances, only 55 per cent, of total stocks can be regarded as &quot; relatively secure.&quot;Cost of Building up Stocks to three months&apos; level on rationed basis.3. It was pointed out in the Seventh Report of the Petroleum Products Reserves Sub-Committee that, taking as a basis the distribution of stocks in Areas A and B as they existed at the end of December 1936, and assuming that the oil companies built up their stocks to three months&apos; normal consumption, with the additional stocks, distributed in Areas A and B on the same basis as existing stocks, there would be a shortage of 250,000 tons of motor spirit, 200,000 tons of fuel oil and 33,000 tons of kerosene to bring the commercial stocks to the level of three months&apos; rationed requirements on a 55 per cent, &quot;relatively secure&quot; basis. These figures assume that all these extra stocks would be placed in Area B. If the figures are-related to the year 1940 (the basal year adopted for all calculations), the shortage&apos; would amount to 275,000 tons of motor spirit, 250,000 tons of fuel oil and 50,000 tons of kerosene. (When the estimates of the consumption during the year 1937 and the particulars of stocks at the end of the year are available, it may be that the above figures will have to be revised.)4. The capital cost of putting down these additional reserves, including tanks and ancillary pipes, &amp;c, was referred to in the Seventh Report, but it was pointed out that certain annual charges, which could not then be estimated, would be incurred. The principal oil companies have now furnished the Petroleum Department with a detailed statement of the capital cost and the annual charges, including interest on capital and the additional cost of &quot; turning over&quot; the stocks, of putting down in the &quot;relatively secure&quot; area stocks of motor spirit and fuel oil equivalent to one month&apos;s consumption of their group. The details are set out in Appendix I attached. These costs are in respect of above-ground tanks conforming to the best current commercial practice, and,* Also C.I.D. 1363-B.t C.I.D. 300th Meeting, Conclusion 2 (a).

As already indicated, the additional stocks would all be placed in Area B.. If they are dispersed and the most modern methods of above-ground lay-out adopted, as has been arranged for the whole of the War Office reserve of motor spirit and a proportion of the Air Ministry reserve of aviation spirit, the question arises whether protected storage would be necessary. If it should be decided that the civil reserve should be given a measure of protection, it may nevertheless be thought unnecessary to provide protection in the case of fuel oil. The additional capital cost, so far as it can be estimated without knowledge of particular sites, would be as follows, for alternative types of storage and for the quantities of motor spirit and kerosene shown in paragraph 4 in respect of the year 1940 : Capital Costadditional to that shown in paragraph 5.Type (i). The provision of 4,000-ton pressure tanks without steel roofs, but with concrete side walls and roofs, to give protection against small incendiary bombs, splinters, &amp;c. They can be effectively camouflaged if located in natural depressions, &amp;c. : Cost of tanks and protection, about  3 10s. per ton ... 270,000*Type (ii).--The provision of 4,000-ton pressure tanks without steel roofs, but with concrete sides and roofs, with earth type filling and side earth fillings to normal slopes, to give protection against light incendiary bombs and against any- &apos; thing except direct hits from heavy bombs: Cost of tanks and protection,about  4 8s. per ton      .......      ... 620,000*Type (iii). Underground tank to give com-plete concealment and protection against 25-lb. bomb : Cost of tanks and protec-tion, about  9 per ton   ......      ...      2,320,0004,500,0004,850,0006,550,000* In these cases individual retaining walls or bunds would not be necessary, and allowance has been made for this in the additional capital required.[16929]b 2
j.^ 7. iIn. all the above cases of protected storage, the loss of spirit due to evaporation would be negligible and therefore the annual charges for such losses  between  30-40,000 would be saved; as would also be the maintenance of the tanks, the cost of which is not available. On the other hand, an allowance would have to be made for the interest on the additional capital required, which, at 6 per cent.,&quot;&quot;would be about  16,000 per annum for type (i),  37,000 for :type (ii), and  139,200 for type (iii).8. It would be desirable to consult the oil companies as to the most suitable sites, in order that the costs of laying down and turning over stocks should be reduced to a minimum.9. It will be seen that the cost of providing underground storage giving protection against 25-lb. bombs has been taken at about  9 per ton, which is the figure adopted by the Air Ministry for the storage of aviation spirit. It includes the cost of the necessary steel lining.10. The Admiralty have investigated several schemes for the storage of fuel oil in underground concrete lined reservoirs. Apart from the site at Rosyth, where a quarry is being used, the reservoirs are being placed in the sides of sandstone hills, by which means protection against any type of bomb is secured. The estimated cost of this type of storage is about  6 per ton. If all the fuel oil were placed in this type of storage, the total capital cost would be about  7-4 million. To place the fuel oil in storage of types (i) and (ii) would give a total capital cost of  4f million and  5^ million respectively.11. A scheme is contemplated by the Anglo-American Oil Company for the storage-of commercial stocks of motor spirit at Purfleet in covered tanks. The scheme provides for the complete concealment and protection of the tanks against light incendiary bombs, isolation of the tanks against fire risks, and a great measure of security to surrounding property. It is estimated that it will cost  3 15s. per ton of product stored. This type is closely allied to type (ii) in paragraph 6.12. In considering the question of the type of storages to be adopted, it will be remembered that the Camouflage Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence have drawn the attention of the Oil Board* and the Reserves Sub-committee to their view that, so far as can be foreseen at present, any great measure of success in protecting large tank farms is improbable by camouflage methods. They also mention that their attention has been drawn to the method adopted by the Air Ministry for the storage of aviation spirit in earth-covered reinforced steel-lined tanks (referred to in paragraph 6 as type (ii)), which they point out &apos;&apos; affords protection against ordinary bombs, and also is a very effective means of camouflaging the tanks themselves.&quot;13. Inasmuch as the additional civil reserves would be placed in Area B and dispersed, the need for active defences might not be considered essential, and some saving on this account may be possible.Summary.1. The cost of providing the fuel and above-ground tanks for the additional civil reserves estimated to be required to build up civil stocks to the three months&apos; rationed level on the basis that 55 per cent, of the stocks in the country are considered &quot; relatively secure,&quot; assuming that the oil companies build their stocks up to three months&apos; normal consumption, a position which has not yet been attained, would be about  4,230,000, with an annual charge of  558,000.2. If these stocks were dispersed in Area B and the layout based on the most modern above-ground lines similar to that adopted for the War Office stocks of motor spirit and part of the Air Ministry stock of aviation spirit, it may be considered that protected storage would not be necessary.3. If protected storage were provided for motor spirit and kerosene, the additional capital cost of providing protection would vary according to the type of protection required from  270,000 to  2^ million, making a total capital cost varying from  4-1 million to  6-1 million. If fuel oil were protected on the same lines, the total figures would range from  4f million to  7^- million.2 Whitehall Gardens S. W. 1, February 2, 1938.* O.B. Paper No. 213.f O.B. (P.R.)
