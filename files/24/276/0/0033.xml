Paper No. 1421-B.)(Previous reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 298th Meeting, Minute 5.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a memorandum on the German Army Its Present Strength and Possible Rate of Expansion in Peace and War prepared in collaboration between the General Staff (War Office) and the Industrial Intelligence Centre (Department of Overseas Trade) and based on information available up to the 1st January, 1938 (C.I.D. Paper No. 1421-B).Me. MORTON in the absence of Mr. St. Quintin Hill, Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries, introduced the Report. He explained that since it had been written the &quot; Anschluss &quot; between Germany and Austria had taken place, and that it was therefore proposed to submit a further report at an early date which would take into account the effect of this coup on the strength of the German Army. He added. that reliable information had just been received from a prominent industrialist in this country, to the effect that plans for the rationalization, expansion and mobilization-tion of Austrian industry by Germany had been in preparation for some years, and that these plans were put into operation four days after the German occupation of Austria.LORD GORT, referring to the figures of strength quoted in Paragraph 2 (e) of the Report, said that 4 Army Group H.Q. had now been increased to 5, including one Austrian; there were now 19 Army Group HQ. instead of 15; and 43 Infantry Divisions 36 German and 7 Austrian, instead of 36. The Mountain Brigade, which was the only force which entered Austria with all the precautions of war and moved up to the Brenner Pass, had now been expanded to a Mountain Division this was very significant. The Light Brigade had been expanded to a Light Division, although very little was known about this at present.Mr. HORE-BELISHA observed that the Memorandum under consideration (paragraph 6) put the force which Germany could put into the field at 108 Divisions, whereas the French estimated it at 120 divisions.[17128-1]
In reply to a question by Sir Maurice Hankey, Mr. MORTON said that Messrs. Skoda&apos;s armament works were situated not actually in, but very near to, the German part of Czechoslovakia-in the West. Subsidiary factories had been set up in the East of the country, but, generally speaking, it could be said that, if the Western end of Czechoslovakia were lost, practically the whole of the industry of the country would go with it.

SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested, and SIR THOMAS INSKIP agreed, that the Paper on the German Army, together with the Minutes of the discussion thereon, should be submitted to the Cabinet.

CONCLUSION.

THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed :-

That the Memorandum on the German Army, prepared in collaboration between the General Staff (War Office) and the Industrial Intelligence Centre (Department of Overseas Trade) (C.I.D. Paper No. 1421-B), together with the above Minutes, should be remitted to the Cabinet.

Enclosure to Annex. [F.C.I. 115] t -   ^.The :German Army/ its Present Strength and Possible Bate of Expansion -&apos; in Peace and War.   .. ,.Memorandum prepared in collaboration between the General Staff (War Office) and the Industrial Intelligence Centre (Department of Overseas Trade).THIS memorandum, prepared in collaboration between the General Staff (War Office) and the Industrial Intelligence Centre (Department of Overseas Trade), is one of a regular series in which is reviewed the information available regarding the strength of the German Army as on the 1st January, 1938, and its possible rate of expansion in peace and war.* The last Paper in this series was prepared in July 1937 (C.I.D. Paper No. 1345-B).1. Strength of the German Army in July 1937. In July 1937 the strength of the German Army was estimated at (a) Peace-time strength.36 active infantry divisions, 3 armoured divisions,2 independent brigades (1 cavalry and 1 mountain), all fully armed and equipped.(b) Possible war-time expansion.In addition to the above, it was estimated that Germany could have put into the field in July 1937-(i) 7 reserve infantry divisions, armed on the same scale as the active divisions, or a greater but indeterminable number armed on a lower scale; and(ii) 21-24 Landwehr divisions,, equipped generally on a lower scale than the above formations and deficient in artillery.2. German Policy for Further Expansion..The aim of the German Government is to be able to mobilise on the outbreak of war the largest Army which the economy and man-power of the nation are capable of sustaining.Our previous report expressed the view that this objective would now gradually be achieved mainly by the creation of reserve and Landwehr divisions, without adding greatly to the strength of the active peace-time army.Recent information, however, suggests that the possibility of an increase in the strength of the active Army cannot be ruled out, although the present evidence points, on the whole, to an accretion of strength due to increasing the size and striking power of existing active divisions and of Corps and Army troops rather than to any addition in the number of active divisions.The secrecy surrounding the German Army, however, makes it increasingly difficult to obtain accurate information about the progress of its expansion, and an actual increase in the number of active divisions is not an impossible contingency.It will be recalled that Herr Hitler has stated that the German peace-time active Army would consist of 36 divisions, and that subsequently the explanation was tendered that this figure referred to infantry divisions and did not include armoured divisions. The appearance, therefore, of a fourth armoured division, of a fourth Army Group Headquarters and of two new Army Corps Head-quarters (XIV and XV; XIII had already appeared at the date of our last report) would presumably not be held by the German Government in any way to contravene any pledge given or implied by the Fiihrer.&apos; ;; * Note. Since this paper was-written, the &quot;Anschluss &quot; between Germany and Austria&apos;has taken place.-       . &apos;   -1*, ;     i ,      ,   /; &apos; :   . ...:. ,The ,former Austrian Army, has been incorporated into the German Army and is being , reorganised into two corps, each of-three divisions, and an armoured formation, of which no details are at present available.
3. Strength of the Peace-Time German Army in January 1938. :.  *    i1 : Thus, although the strength of the peace-time; (active) German Army in January 1938 may appear at first glance to.be much the same as it was six months previously, the striking power of this force has been, or is being, Increased in several ways, of which the following are the more important;-- ,x,.: \\\.       (a) Motorised divisions.Four of the 36 infantry divisions are now reported to have been completely motorised (i.e., all the personnel is normally carried in motor vehicles and all transport and ancillary troops are mechanized), and it is believed to be the intention to motorise two more.(b) Formation of &quot; Light Brigades.&quot;One powerful motorised reconnaissance unit, capable of great speed and having a wide radius of action, but having no tanks, known as a &quot;Light Brigade,&quot; has been formed, and it is reported that the formation of a second is contemplated.(c) Increase in tank strength of armoured divisions.Apart from reports that Germany now possesses four armoured divisions in place of three, the intention is reported to increase the number of tanks in each armoured division from 400 to about 600.(d) Additional tank battalions with infantry Corps, or divisions.Confirmation has been received of the creation of tank battalions, which may eventually comprise up to 200 tanks apiece. It was previously supposed that one battalion was to be attached to each infantry corps, but recently a battalion with the number 32 has been identified, whence it may be the intention to increase the strength of each active infantry division by the addition of one such battalion.(e) Motorised machine-gun battalions.In addition to including a machine-gun company in each, infantry battalion, Germany was known to be forming separate motorised machine-gun !   battalions.  Whereas it was first thought that one of these was to be attached to each Corps as Corps troops, necessitating a maximum of 13, a battalion with the number 35 has recently been identified.A realistic comparison between the reported active peace-time German Army of to-day with that-of six months previously would therefore be : July 1937. January 1938.3 Army Group H.Qs. 4 Army Group II.Qs.13 Army Corps H.Qs. ,      13-15 Army Corps H.Qs.,3 armoured divisions. 3-4 Armoured      divisions      (tank- 36 infantry divisions. strength to be increased by independent brigades (1 cavalry and 50 per cent.).1 mountain). 36 infantry divisions (4 motorised).2 independent brigades (1 cavalryand 1 mountain). 1 light brigade.Up    to   32 . independent   tank battalions.v Up to 35 independent motorised\ machine-gun battalions. -&apos; &apos; 4. Reserve and Landwehr,Divisions.The formation of reserve and Landwehr divisions which do not form part of the active peace-time Army continues, and it is believed to be the German intention eventually to form from men up to 35 years of age two reserve divisions for each active infantry division and 36.Landwehr divisions of- &quot;men over 35. which, with the active Army, will probably;be the maximum whichthe manpower of Germany will allow. &apos;&quot;-.&apos;*[170611 b 2
The number of reserve divisions in existence is not accurately known, buti it&apos; must depend primarily on the availability of armaments. The number of trained! men available for incorporation in reserve divisions exceeds, and will probably1 continue for some time to exceed, the number which can be armed on a scale comparable tq,that of the active divisions.   - &apos;    -   &apos;The number of Eandwehr divisions formed is believed to be 21-24, but these divisions are equipped on a much lower scale than the active divisions and lack artillery. -      ; : : -      -    &apos;5. Factors limiting Expansion on Mobilisation.Whereas the size of the active German peace-time Army is of importance, that of the Army which Germany could put into the field on mobilisation is even more so.  This will depend upon (a) the number of trained men available;(b) the rate at which additional officers and non-commissioned officers canbe trained;(c) the rate of output of armament stbres;of which (c) is by far the most important limiting factor.Our last report estimated that stocks of armaments in Germany sufficed fully to arm arid equip the active peace-time army and 7 additional divisions in the most modern fashion, save that no medium or heavy tanks had been issued to units. It was further believed that very considerable stocks of small arms were held, over and above what would be necessary for this force. The rate of output of armaments was calculated to suffice fully to equip 15 extra divisions per annum.. It has since been learnt that the Ministry of Economics attempted in April 1937 to cut down the allotment of raw materials to armament firms by 20 per cent, or 30 per cent, in the interest of the export trade. The German military authorities contested the execution of this decision, and up to the end of August, at any rate, the output of armaments had riot been reduced, but had even slightly increased, compared with the corresponding eight months of 1936. Moreover, no subsequent information received suggests any serious alteration in the rate of output up to the end of 1937. ;,       ,, It is estimated that Germany held on the 1st January, 1938, sufficient stocks of armaments to enable her, in the event of war in the immediate future, to mobilize not only the whole of her active army, but also fifteen reserve divisions or possibly a larger number of reserve divisions equipped at a lower scale than the active divisions.Such a force would, however, lack any considerable war reserve of armaments and would depend for its maintenance from the outset on the delivery of armament stores direct from Industry. Although German Industry may be regarded at the moment as partially mobilised for the production of armaments, there is room for doubt that it could respond with sufficient rapidity to so heavy a demand, though here again the nature of the demand would depend entirely upon the strength of the opposition encountered by the- German Armies. The most that can be hazarded is that, on the balance of evidence available, German Industry, though continuing to deliver armament stores at a rate previously unprecedented&apos; in any country,in peace, is riot yet ready to stand the strain of a war involving the active employment of an Army of 55 divisions or more against an enemy fully armed and not taken by surprise and therefore not overcome with comparatively little resistance.In fact, Germany might irideed mobilise and fully equip in the first instance an Army of some 55 divisions, but it would be very doubtful if she could maintain so large an Army in the field for long, as things are at present.6. Future Expansion in War.The supply of armaments and all that that involves, e.g., stocks of raw materials, reserves of skilled labour, &amp;c.j is the factor which will continue to limit the potential expansion of the German Army in war.By January 1942, but not before, if the rate of output continues as at present, Germany should be able to mobilise and fully equip a further 57 infantry divisions; making a total of 108 divisions; that is to say, she will be able in war to triplicate her present peace-time Army of 36 infantry divisions, which in point of fact will
probably be the maximum of which the man-power of the nation is capable. Even so, however, the mobilisation of the whole 108 infantry divisions, with 4 to 6 armoured divisions, corps and Army troops, &amp;c. (without counting such Landwehr divisions, as;may by then&apos; be available), will probably absorb1 practically the whole of the -vvar reserve, of armaments. It is not possible&apos; at this date to prophesy the extent to which German industry will by then be in a position to supply this vast army direct from output. , Even though the German policy of spreading educa-tional orders to additional firms may by them have greatly increased potential&apos; capacity, the value of this capacity will depend on a number of unknown factors&apos;; of which perhaps the most important is the size of strategic reserves of raw materials. &quot;&apos;  &apos;This forecast must of necessity be highly speculative. Alteration in the. rate of output of armaments, which may, for example, between now and 1942, be: reduced owing to financial difficulties, or not impossibly-^-may ,even -increase,, will, of course, produce a corresponding lengthening or shortening of the time-lag before Germany is able to arm her whole available man-power.7. Conclusions.Erom the foregoing it may be concluded that :  ; ,.(a) The aim of the German Government is still to be able to mobilise on theoutbreak of war the largest Army which the economy and man-power of the nation are capable of sustaining.(b) Although the number of infantry divisions in the active peace-time Armyremains the same at the moment, viz., 36, there are signs of the. creation of a fourth armoured division, while the strength of the peace-time Army is otherwise being increased by :- 1(i) the motorization of four of the 36 infantry divisions; (ii) the creation of additional tank battalions and motorised machine gun battalions to the active corps or divisions; . i(iii) an increase in the tank strength of the armoured divisions;.....(iv) the formation of one or more independent &quot; Light Brigades.&apos;&apos;. .;-(c) There is no evidence as yet of the slowing down of the rate of production of armaments for the Army, and the present output, which is estimated to be sufficient fully to equip 15 new divisions per annum, is being mainly devoted to equipping the additional units in the peace-time Army or being stored with a view to equipping reserve divisions on mobilisation.id) Should Germany go to war in the near future, she could mobilise three or four armoured divisions and 51 infantry divisions, of which 15 would be reserve divisions, apart from some additional formations, and 21 to 24 Landwehr divisions which would, however, only be equipped with infantry weapons. &apos; &apos; &apos;*&apos;-(e) If the output of armaments in Germany continues at the same rate as at present, Germany should be able by January 1942, but not before, to mobilise the maximum land forces of which the national man-power and economy is capable, that is to say that she could put into&apos; the field from 4 to 6 armoured divisions and 108 infantry divisions, apart frOm independent units and a certain number of Landwehr divisions, though the last-mentioned w^ould still be deficient in artillery. There is reason to doubt, however, that, even so, German Industry would be able to maintain so large a force in the absence of a considerable w^ar reserve of armaments. *   &quot;War Office, S.W. 1, March 20. 1938.
