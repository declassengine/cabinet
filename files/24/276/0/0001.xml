THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY..0 R E T,It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.p 74 (381 Copy No.   (lST^CAB 1MB.....T.ACCELERATION OF DEFENSIVE pr3parat IONS BY CIVIL DEPARTMENTS.,Note &quot;by the Minister for Co-ordination of DefenceoIt will &quot;be remembered that at the Cabinet Meeting held on the 14th March, 1938,  (Cabinet 13(38) Conclusion 3(b))., I was asked to take up the question of the. acceleration of the Defence Programme in regard to aircraft and anti-aircraft guns.      This is in hand. 2. In reviewing our war preparations as a whole,       . .however, I have reached the conclusion that there is a corresponding need for hastening our general war preparation in other spheres,  including more particularly those which are the responsibility of Civil Departments. 3. Perhaps  the obvious example is that of Air RaidPrecautions..      In this matter, however, . special machinery has been set up by the Home Office.      Plans are already in an advanced stage of development, and good progress is being made.     Even in this region,-however, it is.possible that acceleration may be practicable.4o        * Other spheres susceptible of more definiteacceleration would appear to include -(a)    In.the Board of Trade -(i)    The building up of civil stocks of . oil t-o a reserve of three months&apos; supply.(ii)   Measures for increasing the security of existing stocks of oilo, -1- :&apos;-       HI
(iii)    The provision of additional tankers. -(b) In the Ministry of Health -(i)    Precautions in respect of water supply.(11)   Arrangements for the provision and distribution of medical personnel.(iii)   Measures for the&apos; safety of the sick.(c) In the Ministry of Transport -(i)    The co-ordination of transport requirements.(ii)   A decision regarding the questionof the responsibility for the ..cost of war precautions, e.g., at ports.(d) In several Departments -The completion of plans for the exertion of economic pressure on our potential enemies.5. I raise this question in.no spirit--of-..critic-ism.I am aware that in some matters (e.g. the question ofa reserve of food in time of war) lack of progress isdue to delays in reaching decisions on policy.     Apartfrom this, however. I have the impression that in somecases the war    work of Civil Departments is retardedby competition between war preparation and current work.If the same man is to do both, the curx^ent work tends to come first and the war preparation second.     Thetwo are often so closely related that the same man or typeof man is needed for both.    In normal time    this coursemay be unavoidable, but the times are not normal and I suggest that war preparation should now be given equal priority with current work.6. I, therefore, ask that the Cabinet should issue a general directive to all Departments in the sense that -(i)   War preparation work is to have equal priority to civil work.(ii)    That the aim must be to complete it asfar as possible by say,  the 31st July, 1958, except in so far as it involves work of construction which cannot be finished by then and
(iii)    That Civil Departments should tell off the staff required to produce these results even if it should mean a readjustment of their present organisation and a temporary increase of staff.(Intld.)    ToV/-. H, I,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I., 22nd March, 1938.
