ANNEXCONCLUSIONS OF THE 519th MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE HELD ON THE 11th APRIL, 1958.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed: GENERAL.(l)    To approve the assumptions in Paragraph 4 of the Chiefs of Staff Report (D.P.  (p) 24) in the following fornu-(a) That the first communication to the French Government of the limitations on the extentof our co-operation., especially by land forces, will be made through Ministerial or Diplomatic channels before the Staff Conversations begin.(b) That the Conversations are undertaken on the basis that we are called upon to fulfil the undertaking to go to the assistance of Prance (Belgium) in the event of unprovoked aggression by Germany, given in the Treaty of Locarno of 1925, and reaffirmed in paragraph 3 of the Agreement drawn up in London on March 19th, 1936, after the occupation by Germany of the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland, which reads as follows:-The Representatives of Belgium, Prance,  the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Italy&quot;Declare that nothing that has happened before or since the said breach of the Treaty of Locarno can be considered as having freed the Signatories of that Treaty from any of their obligations or guarantees and that the latter subsist in their entirety,,Undertake forthwith to instruct their General Staffs to enter into contact with a view to arranging the technical conditions in which the obligations which, are binding upisn them should be carried out in case of unprovoked aggression.&quot;    (cmnd 5134/36);and&apos; that the Conversations are undertaken without any reference to the two alternatives suggested in our report on Military t,, Implications of German Aggression againstCzecho-Blovakiao    (D.Po  (P) 22)(c) That Italy is neutral.(d) That the intention is that any Conversations with the French may also be extended to the Belgians.     Any communication to the Belgians on secret matters should be made through Staff channels.,
(2)    That the initial cooinrnunication to the FrenchGovernment referred to above, besides containing the notification that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to authorise Staff Conversations, should also include the following points, which are dealt with in greater detail belows*-(a)   The scope of the Conversations (Conclusion (3)(b) Our conception of the character of the war (Conclusion (4));    and(c) The nature and extent of our co-operation at the outset of war (Conclusion (6)).The necessary material for Ministerial or, alternatively, for Diplomatic use in connection With this communication will be furnished to the Foreign Office by the Defence Departments concerned.(3)    That, in view of the satisfactory progress made in the Conversations with Italy and the great importance of doing nothing calculated either to jeopardise the conclusion of an Agreement or to weaken it thereafter, It is undesirable to extend the scope of the Conversations to the Mediterranean. Also, in view of the extent to which Japan is committed in China, it is unnecessary at present to extend them to cover the Far East.     For the present, therefore, the political assumptions on which Staff Conversations should be founded should be a strict interpretation of our Treaty obligations to France and Belgium,&quot;    that is to say,. Germany alone should be assumed as the aggressor? and the Conversations should not be permitted to comprehend the extension of war to other nations, whether as potential enemies or alliesb     The British representatives, if pressed by the French Staff representatives to extend the scope of the Conversations to embrace wider political assumptions, must be careful to avoid, giving a rebuff, and should explain that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, after -careful consideration, did not consider any further political assumptions necessary or desirable at the present time (4)   That the military background of the conversations should be, not, a repetition of 1914, but war of the character envisaged by the Committee of Imperial Defence, in which the course of action most likely to be adopted by Germany is believed to involve an attempted knock-out blow.      In view of the strength of the Maginot Lines this is less likely to be directed against France than against the industrial and other resources of this country, which are especially vulnerable to air attack.
Naval.(5)       that Naval Conversations should not be held at present34 for the following, reasons:-(a) the contingency which is to form the basis of the Conversations (see Conclusion   (TL) above)/.,   namely, an aggression by Germany, which does not involve either Italy or Japan, does not call for any re-distribution in time of peace of the British and French Fleets:(b) plans for the effective oo-operation of these Fleets could be concerted very quickls^ after the outbreak of war:(c) if the fact of our having entered into Naval Conversations with the French were to become known to Germany, she might make it an excuse to denounce the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of July 17, 1957, to the maintenance of which the Admiralty attach great importance.Army(6)      that,in view of our conception of the most probable course of the war (see Conclusion [(A)   above^, and the recent  decisions as to the Role of the Army, which follow from it, the probability of our being able to send an expeditionary force to France or Belgium at an early stage of the war is so slight that Military Staff Conversations are unnecessary^o      It should be emphasised .in the communication to the French Government referred to in conclusions (1) and ( 2.)   above that our assistance to France will take other forms:    that His Majesty&apos;s Government had felt that it would be unfair to the French Government not to notify them of this:    and that the French General Staffs would accordingly be well advised to base their.plans on the assumption that, in the early stages of a war at any rate, it will probably not be practicable for us to send a military expeditionary force to the Continent.This recommendation involves a reversal of Cabinet conclusion 18 (38) 7 (a) of the, 6th April, 1938, when it was decided that the proposed Air Staff Conversations should be extended to the Naval and Army Staffs also.
-   117Air Force.That, as recommended by the Chiefa of Staff Committees the scope of the Air Staff Conversations should he as follows(a) A general discussion as to the plans of the two Air Forces.(b) A frank interchange of information as to the capacity of the two Forces at the present time and the extent to which this may be expected to develop as time goes on,(c) Detailed plans for the co-operation of the two air striking forces, together with the administrative details necessary to enable British Air Forces to operate from French soil.(d) The co-ordination of the three Air Defence Systems, including the linking-up of the observation and warning systemso(8)   With reference to Conclusion (?)(c) above, alternative plans for our own Air Striking Force should be prepared, first to deal with&apos; the case of the main German air attack being directed against this country, and secondly, to deal with the case of the main German air attack being directed against France.      In accordance with our general conception of the probable course of the war, it should be frankly explained to the French that the primary object of our Air Striking Force is &quot;  . the defence of this country, but the Conversations would natural!?/ bring out the fact that any action which we might take to reduce the scale 03? attack on- the British Isles would be a substantial, albeit indirect, contribution towards the Defence of France.(9)    That the Secretary of State for Air should&apos; give further consideration to the risk of Germany&apos;accusing the Air Staffj in the event of Conversations,;, of a breach of the under-taking given by the Chief of the Air Staff and his predecessor not to divulge to the French information or German air strength, which had been given to them by the German - Air Staff and which on the first occasion proved inaccurate.- and 0:0. the second occasion was already known to usb      If it is considered that such a risk is a real one, it should then be considered by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Air whether notification should be made to Germany of the Conversations,  and an assurance given as to the observance of the under baking above referred to,     A similar point will arise in the event of Naval Conversations being taken up later.(?)
(10)   That if it is decided to make a communication to the German Government on the proposed Conversations with the French and Belgian Governments, it should he made clear that the Conversations are merely a continuation of the contacts between General Staffs announced in -wApril, 1936, after the German re-o&apos;ccupation of the Rhineland (Cmd. 5149/36, No. 2 and No..5).(11)   That the question of whether the Conversations between the British and French (and Belgian) Air Staffs should be conducted through the channel of Air Attaches and occasional interchanges of visits, as previously contemplated (Cabinet 5 (38) Conclusion 12), or whether they should be brought on to a higher plane as decided in principle by the Cabinet (Cabinet 18 (38) Conclusion 7 (a)) should be reserved for the present.(12)    That the report by the Chiefs of Staff, together with the above Conclusions thereon, and the Minutes of the discussion, should be circulated to the Cabinet for consideration at its next regular weekly meeting.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.-ANNEX II.SECRET. &apos;* COPY NO.COMMITTEE OP IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 319th Meeting, held on 11th A-pril. 1938.(1)    STAFF CONVERSATIONS WITH FRANCE AND BELGIUM..(Paper No. D.P.(P) 24).(Previous Reference:    Minutes of C,I.D,/310th Meeting,Minute 5).THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report36 by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the subject of Staff Conversations with France and Belgium (Enclosure to Paper No. D.P.(P)  24).LORD CHATFIELD, on the invitation of the Prime Ministerto introduce the Report, asked that he might be permitted to confine himself to certain observations- of a general character, and to an explanation of the Naval section ofthe Report;    and that the Chief of the.Imperial GeneralStaff and the Chief of the Air Staff should deal with theirrespective sections. -Basic . The Committee would observe that in paragraph 4, the assumptions.Chiefs, of Staff had asked for confirmation of four assuming;ptJLaiaS% The first of these implied that it would not be for the respective Staffs but rather the responsibility of Ministers to break any unpalatable news to the French.    The second * assumption had been inserted in order to make sure that the conversations now contemplated should not be related to the possibility of German aggression against Czechoslovakia, upon which the Chiefs Of Staff had recently rendered a Repo rti*36 Paper No. CO.S. 707./zf Paper No.. D.P.(P) 22. -1-
-  148and in which it had &quot;been envisaged that we might be rangedin alliance with a number of central European countries.The Scope Turning to the naval aspect, it would be noted thatof NavalConversations.-     in paragraph 8, the Chiefs of Staff had&apos;considered that- the scope of Staff conversations should embrace an exchangeof information on proposed naval dispositions for war. For instance, the French might wish to redispose certain units of their Fleet now situated at ports in the North West of France to ports in the South, such as Toulon: similarly we might move a portion of our Mediterranean Fleet to Home waters as we did in 1914.     We should also have to arrange with the French for the disposition of our respective cruiser squadrons for the protection of seaborne trade     Another important question to be discussed would be that of command.      It might, for example, be found appropriate, as in 1915, to turn over the naval command in the Mediterranean to the French. -Alternatively, the French might be willing to place certain of their Naval forces, which would work in the Atlantic and in the Home area, under British command. In the event of Italy being hostile, the French might move some of their native troops from their African colonies via West African ports through the Atlantic to a port in Northern France such as Boulogne.      In this event, we might be asked to arrange for escorts.The possible In paragraph 9, an important question was raised,effect of NavalConversations on namely the risk of Germany denouncing the Anglo-German the Anglo-german naval Agreement. 35% Naval Agreement, if the Naval Conversations were tocome to their knowledge.      This would have very serious consequences, and involve a reconsideration of the whole naval position.
He recalled the basis on which the Agreement had been made, and quoted the following extract from a statement made by Herr von Ribbentrop at the opening of  he Naval talks which lead up to its conclusion:-&quot;The necessity for protecting Germany and her maritime communications on the one hand, and the recognition of Great Britain&apos;s historic claim to naval supremacy on the other hand,, led the Germai Chancellor to fix the German requirements of warship-tonnage at 35$ of the British total tonnageo     The German Chancellor could not have contemplated this voluntary limitation, by a sovereign state, of its naval defence if he had not, once and for ever, excluded Great Britain as a possible enemy from all considerations of German defence0The German Government express the hope that this broad-minded decision of the Chancellor &apos;  will be fully appreciated as a German contribution of the greatest historic importance toward the future development of the relations between our two countries and the pacification of Europe.In these circumstance it should be superfluous for the German Delegation to point out that they can only hope for success of such negotiations, and that they can only enter into these conver-. sations3 which they think would be extrememly useful, if the British side recognise also for their part the ratio ICO/Great Britain: : 35/Germany as an unalterably fixed relation. But in order to avoid, from the very outset, any possible misunderstanding on this point, the German Delegation would be very grateful to the British Delegation for a confirmation ast o the agreement on this principle.The advantages which such a permanent settlement of the ::.aval problem would involve for our two countries cannot be over-estimated.A senseless naval rivalry between the two countries,- which is justified by no political necessity, and which would only involve further tremendous financial burdens and necessarily produce a fresh estrangement between our two nations, would be definitely excluded,,Great Britain&apos;s naval supremacy, which is an indispensible and vital necessity for your country, and i/fo ich Germany fully recognises, would be secured, as well as German naval defence requirements9&quot;If we told the Germans that we were concerting naval measures w ith t he French, this might give them
-   15.1the excuse that she might be seeking to denounce the agreemen to      In these- circumstances, would it not perhaps be possible for the Naval conversations either to be excluded or at least to be kept secret?LORD HALIFAX interpolated that no decision had yet been reached as t o whether there was t o be any announcement to the Germans in respect of the proposed conversat ions0the Conversations should cover.The areas which LORD CHATFIELD, continuing, referred to paragraph310 in which the areas9 which it was suggested the Naval conversations should cover, were set out.      If it was to be assumed that Italy might come in against us, then the opposition of Japan would also have to be taken into account.     In that event, we might have to leave the French to look after the Mediterranean and, indeed, we should have to rely upon their help to hold the position.in the Home area also.     When discussions took place, the implications of Japanese intervention should be clearly put before the French.ArmyConversations.Assembly Areas.LORD GORT summarised the main points in paragraphs 11 to 18-,       He invited particular attention to the suggestion that conversations should only cover the movement of any expeditionary force which it might be possible to despatch to the Continent up to and including the assembly area, and   should not extend to the concentration areas,    as was done in the pre-war conversations.       As a result,    the British Expeditionary Force in 1914 was committed
The size ofField Forceavailable.The impli-catlpns of the  despatchof a field force,;;Base and Lines ofCommunicationUnits.to concentrations in the Maubeuge area, contrary to the wishes and intention ot backward Asquith and Lord Kitchener0Paragraph 14 contained a short review of the forces which could he made available at the present time and in April .1959 and 1940 0In paragraph 16,  it was stated that over and above the field force no other regular- or territorial army formations could proceed .overseas, properly equipped for twelve months or more,  after the outbreak of war.      The reason for the words &quot;or more&quot; was that, if a reduction in the Army Rearmament Programme was imposed,  there would be no equipment available for the reinforcements in question for over a year.Paragraph 1?- drew attention to the fact that the French General Staff would&apos; expect that once we were committed to military co-operation we should,  in fact, be committed to the ultimate despatch of a National Army on the scale of 1914-1918.        It was of great *  . importance that the General Staff should have clear instructions as to the limitations of our cormmitments on land.In paragraph 169  it&apos; was pointed out that,  if the Advanced Air 8&apos;triking Force - was employed in the same area as the Field Force, the same base and lines of communication troops would be available and adequate for both force so      If, on the other hand, the Advance Air Striking Force and the Field Force were to operate in different theatres, additional units would have to be foimied for which no provision existed, at the present
Information of German Air Strength provided in confidence by the German Air Staff,&quot;Air Conversations. SIR CYRIL NEu/ALL,  referring to paragraph 6,  onthe subject of our information as to the strength of the German Air Force, said that this paragraph as drafted contained an over-statemento      The facts of the case were as follows.      In January,.  1937, General Milch gave Air Vice-Marshal Courtney,, the late Deputy Chief of the Air Staff,  information as to the number of German squadrons in the German Air.Force at 9 machines each, on the understanding that this information should not be divulged either to the French or to Parliament.    The information was accepted on those conditions.      It subsequently proved to be untrue.,      General Milch had also told Air Vice-Marshal Courtney that the Germans-would reach a certain strength by the end of 1938, The Air Staff had estimated that they would reach that strength by the end of 1937,      In October, 1937, General Milch had told him (Sir Cyril Newall) that the Germans, had then reached the strength which he- had told Air Vice-Marshal Courtney they would, reach at the end of 19380      This confirmed, the Air Staffs disbelief in General Milch&apos;s statement, but the latter explained the discrepancy by saying that, when he gave the figures to Air Vice-Marshal Courtney, he also Indicated that the Germans would go faster if they could, and they had in fact done so.      The only other contact with the Germans on the subject of Air strength.took place in December, 1937, between our Air Attache at Berlin and General Milch, when the latter had stated that all the German squadrons were at a strength of IS aircraft,
a fact of which we were already fully aware. To sura up, the first information supplied had proved incorrect; the second was superfluous, except as a cross-check, because we knew it already.The fact remained, however, that, even if we were guilty of no breach of confidence, the Germans would almost certainly so regard iteInformation of LORD CHATFIELD said that the Naval Staff wereGerman naval strength. confronted with a similar problem,.     The Admiraltyat present received from the Germans complete details of their ship construction which included the size of guns, the tonnage of the ships and their speed. This information, unlike that supplied to the Air Force, invariably proved to be correct.      If, in the course of conversations with the French, we&apos; gave it away, the Germans would naturally resent it.LORD HALIFAX inquired whether the information received by the Air Staff from German sources came in at regular intervals, or only spasmodically. If the information was only received infrequently, -presumably it soon became out of date?LORD SvYINTON replied that the Air Staff did not receive a regular supply of information from the Germans
but  on the other hand the information&apos;-from-Secret Service sources was most accurate and efficient.    The only value o  the German statements was by way of a check on this other information.The Scope SIR CYRIL NEWALL continuing said that paragraphs of AirConversations. 19 - 27 contained a summary of the scope and general lineon which it was proposed the conversations, between our Air Staff and the French should be conducted.    In paragraph 20 the point was stressed that the primary role of our Air Force was the defence of the United Kingdom, and that for some time to come we should have no margin of air power in hand to enable us to assist in the defence of France, except in so far as any action to reduce the scale of attack on England would automatically contribute to that defence. He hoped that the Air Staff would be authorised to make this perfectly clear to the French In any conversations that might take place.    In paragraph 21, it was proposed that there should be a frank exchange of information as to the relative efficiency of the respective Air Forces.    The preparation of detailed plans for co-operation referred to in paragraph 22. would include&apos; the necessity for discussing the selection of. objectives, and on this there might be a conflict of principle with the French Air Staff.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that he had taken the Chair, at the meeting at which the chiefs of Staff had discussed their report.-   The assumption made by the Chiefs of Staff that conversations should be based on our
Locarno obligations to Prance and Belgium, and should not he related to the possibility of German aggression against Czechoslovakia seemed to him to accord with the prime Minister&apos;s observations in the Cabinet to the effect that it would be anomalous for us to accept obligations, and not at the same time to place ourselves in a position to fulfil them.    The impression that he (Sir Thomas Inskip) had gained from the report was that the seope&apos; of the conversations as contemplated by the Chiefs of Staff went rather further than preparation for the fulfilment of our obligations to Prance and Belgium, and in effect envisaged an alignment of Europe into two opposite camps and a world war.    It might of course be that the outcome of a war which started strictly from a Locarno basis would he a world war.The political THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if once we were tobasis of theReport. visualise going beyohd our Treaty obligations, it wouldbe necessary to take into account not only our political enemies, but also our political friends.    The report seemed to go rather further than the Cabinet had in mind when the question of staff conversations was recently discussed.    Prom a practical point of view, there were advantages in approaching the problem on a rather narrower basis, i.e. that Germany was the aggressor against Prance or Belgium, that we came in in accordance with our Locarno obligations, and that the rest of the world was neutral.    Once the simple setting was exceeded,
.157a number of hypothetical and highly speculative -alternatives came into the picture      For instance; it was now an unnecessary complication to assume the hostility of Italy. Six montfes ago this might have been necessary:    but not to-day.      Similarly,  the hostility of Japan was by no means certain..    If Japan were to be included as an enemy, then the attitude of the U.S*S-R. and the. U.S.A. would be pertinent factorscLORD SwIITTON considered that the Chiefs of Staff had faithfully carried out their instructions from the Cabinet, but cordially supported the proposal that the jjossibility of a hostile Italy, should not be taken into account.     Even if the agreement with that country, which now seemed to be in sight, did not work out in practice, it seemed illogical to assume beforehand that it would not.      If Staff Considerations were conducted with the French on the assumption of a hostile Italy, this would be almost bound to come to the knowledge of the Italians,  and the Agreement would be wreckedo      The practical policy would be to tell the French that we were not considering Italy as potentially hostile in the event of war against Germany, but as a neutral.SIR SAMUEL HOARD said that he would like to go further. The impression made upon him by the report
was that it did not envisage the kind of war that seemed most probableo      In a war against Germany our own home defence would be the crucial problem,,      The French would take up a defensive &quot;position behind their Maginot line&quot;.    Their Air Force was of low efficiency.    The problem before us was to win &quot;the war over London&quot;0    In order to do so we might have to station certain squadrons of our Advanced Air Striking Force in Franceo He   (Sir Samuel Hoare) viewed the prospect of the despatch of a field force with the gravest misgivings.    We should need, at any rate in the initial stages^, all our available troops to assist in the defence of this country. He  shared the anxieties of Lord Chatfield as to the effect of the possible denunciation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement,      In his view, the conversations should be limited to the discussion of requirements in connection with aerodrome accommodation for our Advanced Air Striking Force in France.LORD HALIFAX expressed entire agreement with the proposal to exclude Italy from the scope of the conversations.      Italy would act in accordance with her own interests, and we could not, of course, rely implicitly on her friendshipo      Nevertheless Mussolini was undoubtedly anxious to achieve agreement with us;    and things were going well.      It would be most unfortunate if, while the wax was still fluid, anything should be done at the present moment to prevent it setting firm.      It would only need a spark at the present time to rekindle all Italy&apos;s former mistrust and hatred.      As stated in the report,  the principal reason for extending the talks&apos; to the Mediterranean was the possibility of trouble, with Japan,    The picture which he had in his mind of Japan at the present   time was that    she was
sprawled over China, hut in no shape to promote trouble with the British Empire.Conclusion  - THE PRIME MINISTER said that there appeared to heas to thepolitical general agreement that the political assumptions on- which thebasis of conversations, conversations should he based was a war which arose out of our treaty obligations with Prance, Belgium and ourselves againstGermany,  and the rest of the neutral world.    On the subjectof the despatch of the field force, the same thoughts had occurred to him as had been expressed by the Secretary ofState for Home Affairs.    He was impressed with the point madein paragraph 17, that the French would expect a great dealArmy &apos; larger military force than we were prepared to afford.    ItConversations.would.be unsound for this country to. start conversations on the pre-war basis and to be committed to any military co-operation on the Continent.    It was indeed difficult to see into what strategical plan our small field force would fit.    The most probable eventuality seemed to be a German air attack against the United Kingdom, while the French Army remained behind the Maginot line, with the German Army facing them.    In these circumstances we could scarcely contemplate the, despatch of our small field force to assist, in the defence of that line.    He favoured telling the French that we could not commit ourselves to the despatch of any military force to the Continent, except such formations as were required for the lines of communication and protection of our Advanced Air Striking Force.   We should impress upon them the importance of both countries safeguarding their brain centres and their wealth.S SIR JOHN SIMON thought that the Chiefs of Staff had gottheir setting somewhat wrong.    His interpretation of what the Cabinet had in mind was that the French should he informed of the recent decision as to the role of the British Army,  and -   that the maximum force which at the present time could, in any
circumstances, be sent to the Continent at the outset would be two divisions.    Conversations on the scale proposed by the Chiefs of Staff might well be regarded by the French as a pledge of assistance on a large scalettSIR THOMAS INSKIP observed that the Chiefs of Staff were well aware in preparing their report that the scope of the conversations would be conditioned by political actione It was the task of the Committee of Imperial Defence to put the information which the Chiefs of Staff had prepared into its right setting,,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the remarks he had put forward were not in any way to be taken as criticising the report by the Chiefs of Staff, which in his view was an illuminating documentoMR. DUFF COOPER suggested that there was,  in fact, no need for conversations between the General Staffs, but that a communication as to the role of the Army should be made between the two Governments0SIR JOHN SIMON referred to paragraph 2 of C.I.D. Paper No,  1405-B (passage side lined A) in which the Cabinet had authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform the French Government confidentially of the role of the British Army, and as to the maximum force which&apos;our present organisation would enable us to despatch to the Continent,,MR. HORE-BELISHA said it was not only an obligation of honour, but also a counsel of expediency that - we should inform the French of the recent decision as to the role of the British Army.    In point of fact, we should have to tell
them not what we could do, hut rather what we could noiThe channel of initialcommunicat ion.do.     We could lighten the blow by informing them of other compensating measures which we could take at sea, in the air and in the sphere of trade.      It was open to doubt, therefore, whether there was any necessity to discuss the question even of assembly areas.LORD GORT agreed.      The number of men involved did not amount to more than 5,000;    and the French accustomed as they were to moving large masses would make light of this problem when it arose.   .MR. HORE-BELISHA suggested that one advantage in telling the French of the limitations in our Army , co-operation might be to expedite their completion; of the Maginot line,LORD HALIFAX expressed agreement with the views put forward by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs. 1  We should aim-at getting the French to think along more realistic lines as to how a Continental war might develop, i..e., not the 1914/18 conception of trench warfare, but of war in the air.     He (Lord Halifax) was as anxious as anyone that the field force should not be sent, and he was strongly opposed to any corollary involving the subsequent despatch of a national army, but he hoped that we should not categorically say that in no circumstances would a field force be sent to the Continent. We should merely inform the French of the recent decision as to the role of the Army, and explain that any military contribution which we could make was so small that Staff Conversations between the General Staffs were unnecessary. He asked how it was proposed to make the initial communication to the French Government.
THE PRIME MINISTER thought that,  if French Ministers visited this country;, this should he done through the ministerial channel;    if not through the diplomatic Continuing lie suggested that the Committee should confirm the assumptions in Paragraph 4(i),  (ii) and (iv), and dissent from that in paragraph 4(iii)0 -LORD HALIFAX said that he had a legal point in connection with assumption (ii) which he would communicate to the Secretary0     With regard to (iv) there would he advantages in communieating with the Belgians through military,,, rather than diplomatic, channels. He assumed that the necessary material for the comraunication to the French Government, whether through ministerial or diplomatic channels, would he&quot; drafted &quot;by the appropriate departments0THE PRIME MINISTER thought that-the Committee; should now address themselves to the Air Staff Conversations,,      According to the Chief of the Air Staff the dilemma referred to in Paragraph 6 was not so rigid as it- appeared,,LORD HALIFAX enquired whether it was the intention that we should tell Germany of these conversations orwhether we should endeavour to keep &apos;them secreteThe latter course a-ppealed to him if it were jjracticable.If a leakage took, placey we could in perfect truthtell Germany that we were merely following up the conversations which took place in 1936c (ISIR CYRIL HEWALL recalled that when Monsieur Pierre Cot visited this country, it was immediately &quot;bandied around Prague that Staff Conversations with the French had &quot;been instituted.

had at once sought an interview with him, and he had been able to deny the rumour.LORD SWINTON said that the German Air Attache would be sure to get wind of any collaboration with the French, and that we should therefore have some formula prepared for this eventuality.MR. DUFF COOPER suggested that so long as the conversations could be maintained on the plane of service attaches, it would probably be possible    to keep them secret.     But once French Ministers were brought in, there was no hope of secrecy.There was some discussion as to whether the Germans, if they came to hear of the Conversations, would accuse us of a breach of faith in divulging to the French the information of the German Air Strength which they had imparted to us in confidence.LORD HALIFAX thought it most important that we should not give them any ground for making such an accusation. It was agreed that the Ministers concerned should consider how this difficulty might be resolved.LORD SWINTON in reply to a question by the Prime Air ForcePlans. Minister regarding Paragraph 20 of the Report, said, thatthe primary   object of our Air Striking Force, was the defence of the United Kingdom.      The,use of French advanced air bases was required solely to further our own counter offensive schemes, and it was of great importance that any squadrons based in France should not be drawn into any French plan which might divorce these squadrons from their primary role.      At the same time any action which our Air Striking Force might take to reduce the weight of German air attack on England would indirectly contribute to the Defence of France.      In addition, we would
have alternative plans to meet the contingency of the main German air attack being directed against france.sir CYRIL NEWALL in reply to a question by the Prime Minister on the possibility of a leakage of the information as to our weaknesses (para.21), said that the Germans were not aware of all of our weak points.      He added, with reference to the question of objectives (para.22), that the French would be anxious for us to give air support to their army.      He earnestly hoped that we would not give way,  and that the Air Staff should be given definite instructions to concentrate on objectives which are calculated to---reduce the scale  of aic attack on this country.Naval THE PRIME MINISTER returning to the question ofC onv e sforza t i ons.naval conversations, said that, in his view, there was certainly not so urgent a need for them as for the other two services.      He was to some extent influenced by the fact that they might involve a denunciation of the Anglo-German Naval Treaty.   -(Paragraph 9).      At the same time he had little doubt that the Germans would denounce the Treaty as and when it suited them, irrespective of any excuse.      He did not think,  however,  that they were quite ready to do so at present.LORD CHATFIELD said that there were two advantages in naval conversations:    first, to reassure the French, and secondly, to ensure that antecedent arrangements v are co-ordinated.      If,  however,  the possibility of war
with Italy were to he excluded,  the need for naval conversations- with the French was far less pressing. Against Germany alone we could bring an overwhelming naval force, and it would take very little time to co-ordinate our naval measures with the French after the outbreak of war, if. necessary,,SIR JOHN SIMON felt that the cases for the three Services were all different.      In the case of the Army, it was a question of disillusioning the French as to the question of our co-operation.      With regard to the Air Force, all that was required was a discussion as to aerodrome and other administrative facilities.MR.  DUFF COOPER said that if one of our objectives was to reassure the French,  it seemed doubtful if the scope of the conversations now contemplated would have that effect.       They would take little-comfort from the information which we had to give them as to the role of the Army, and we were not apparently to be forthcoming over air co-operation.      With regard to the Navy,  the general opinion was that no conversations were required. In his own view, we should not be able to escape,  in the event of war against Germany, sending a field force to the Continento     It was impossible to contemplate France with her back to the wall and three million young men in this country in plain clothes.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had never been dogmatic as to the possibility of our ultimately having to send a large army to the Continent.     But we should not base our plans on that possibility.      The object of the Conversations,  as he saw it, was not so much to re-assure the French as to place ourselves in the best position possible to discharge&apos;our Treaty obligationso

(Previous Paper No. C.O.S. 680.)REPORT.IN accordance with instructions* from the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, we have been asked to submit, with all possible despatch, recommenda-tions as to the scope of Staff Conversations with the French and the forces and areas to which they should apply, for examination by the Committee of Imperial Defence (D.P. (P) representation).2. Our examination of this question has been based on the following decision recorded by the Cabinet at their Meetingt held on the 6th April:- The Cabinet agreed : &quot; (a) to approve in principle that the proposed conversations between the British and French Air Staffs should be extended to the Naval Staffs and Army Staffs and should not be limited to the channel of Service Attaches.&quot;*M. J/, Ji, JA, M.. *7v* -TV3. In view of the urgency of the matter, we have not found it possible to formulate detailed proposals, and the recommendations which follow are, therefore, couched in general terms.4. We have made the following assumptions, for which we ask the confirmation of the Committee of Imperial Defence :- (i) That the first communication^: to the French Government of the limitations on the extent of&apos; our co-operation, especially by land forces, will be made through Ministerial or Diplomatic channels before the Staff Conversations begin, (ii) That the Conversations are undei taken un the basis Lhat we are oajjger&quot; upon to fulfil the undertaking given on the 1st April, l^^fSuie French (and Belgian) Governments immediately aftjn^fcfc &quot;&apos;re-occupa-tion by Germany of the demilitarised zone intJie-^Knineland, namely,, that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the^jy^rited Kingdom &quot; Will immediately cor d-*ft5*the assistance of your Govern-t ment in accordance^wjUJ^Cne Treaty of Locarno, in respect of any measures whieh-eiaylbe jointly decided upon &quot; (Cmd. 5149/36),and withoujMSny reference to the two alternatives discussed in our Repopi^on Military Implications of German aggression against eWoohoDlovakiu.

2; 5.   If staff conversations between potential allies are to be effective, the first essential is a frank exchange of the general outline plan for the employment, in . the initial stages of war, of the navies, armies and air forces of the countries &quot;concerned, together with an exchange of views as to the most likely action by the enemy. . - :It is only when these plans are known that adjustments and co-ordination can be discussed and details worked out.       &apos; &apos; &apos;6.   There is one point in connection with the proposed exchange of views as- to the most likely action by the enemy to which it is necessary to invite attention. At the present time, the Chief of the Air Staff receives strictly confidential information of the strength of the German Air Force, under a promise that he will not divulge this information either to the French or to Parliament. This places us in a quandary : either the Chief of the Air Staff must break his word to Germany, or the exchange of views as to enemy action, which must necessarily include estimates of enemy strength, will have to be conducted on an entirely unreal basis. We ask for guidance from the Committee of Imperial Defence as to how this difficulty should be surmounted......7.   In subsequent paragraphs we consider the scope of conversations with . the French and Belgians, and the forces and areas to which they should apply from the naval, military and air point of view.Navy.8.   Scope. From the naval point of view it is considered that the scope of .; the Staff Conversations should embrace an exchange of information with regard to:-(a) Proposed dispositions for war.(&amp;) Dispositions for the protection of seaborne trade throughout the world.(c) State of forces now in commission and reserves.(d) Availability and defences of ports, r.     (e) Communications and signal codes.- &apos; /   (/) Liaison Officers.(g) Questions of Command.9. Forces. The Conversations should include the present and future : strengths of all naval forces in commission and in reserve of Great Britain and France, and of potential enemies, not excluding serious consideration of the consequences of Germany possibly denouncing the Anglo-German 35 per Cent., naval agreement as an outcome of the conversations now proposed, which would also affect France.i! 10. Areas.--Commencing with a consideration of.the situation arising in Western Europe should Germany attack France, the naval areas involved would be the North Sea, English Channel and Atlantic. Assuming then that Italy joins Germany, the Conversations must include the Mediterranean and Red Sea areas. And finally, in view of the radical nature of the redistribution of our naval forces necessary if Japan should turn hostile, and the much greater extent to which, in these circumstances, we must rely on France in European waters, it will be desirable to extend the conversations to include Jhe possibility of a&apos;hostile Japan.Army.11. Scope.-The French should be informed of the priority of Army com-commitments as approved by the Cabinet (CP. 316 (37)). It should be made clear that our first and main effort must be directed to Home Defence and the preser-vation of the trade routes, which implies the defence of British territories overseas; only when these objectives have been secured can the Continental commitment be considered. As far as the employment of any forces, which may be available, is concerned,. the scope of conversations could only cover the. move-inent up to and including the assembly area* and would include the following administrative questions:-,     (a) The facilities that will be given at the ports of disembarkation in France, .. , and if possible what ports would be available.   It is desirable that they should be, as far as possible outside the range of sustained ... . German air attack.- * Assembly Area. The area in which personnel, vehicles and equipment re-unite after independent shipment to, and disembarkation at, base ports.
1(b) The road and railway facilities from these ports upon which we can rely for the movement of our formations to assembly areas.     ,    ::(c) The allotment to the field force of alternative assembly areas andarrangements for billeting therein. ii &apos;12. The actual concentration area cannot be decided in peace time and must depend on the general strategical situation at the time of its despatch.13. In the Mediterranean area the main basis for conversations would be operational. We should wish to know what French action is proposed, in a war with Italy, against Libya, and what troops might be available from Syria to co-operate with us in Egypt or Palestine. . -14. Forces. With regard to the size of the forces we could send abroad, the situation is as follows : (a) Present situation (April 1938).We can put into the field two divisions only, with an incomplete quota of corps troops, and deficient of many types of equipment essential for war under modern conditions. Arrangements are in hand to land this force in France within 14 days from the date the decision is taken to despatch it..  (b) Anticipated situation (April 1939).We should be able to put into the field an additional two divisions, but these would have an incomplete quota of corps troops and still be deficient of many types of equipment and reserves essential for war under modern conditions. The portion of this force additional to the force in para-graph 14&apos; (a) above would be ready to embark in 40 days.(c) Anticipated situation (April 1940).The Mobile Division would be available in addition to the four divisions. Generally speaking, the force would be provided with up-to-date armament and equipment, with the important exception of medium and heavy artillery, but two out of the four infantry divisions will only have reserves on a scale considerably lower than that regarded as essential for war under modern conditions.15. It is important to emphasise that, if any or all are used on the Continent, they will be capable of holding a defensive sector and of local counter-attack to maintain their positions, but they will not have sufficient resources or reserves to take part in any offensive action for a considerable time.16. Under present arrangements no further Regular or Territorial Arhrj formations can be ready to proceed overseas, properly equipped and with the necessary reserves for war against a first-class enemy, for 12 months or more after the outbreak of war.17. We must draw attention to the fact that the French General Staff and nation, as in 1914, will expect that, once we are committed to military co-opera-tion, we shall, in fact, be committed to co-operation on a far larger scale. If the original forces should be wiped out or prove insufficient, it is difficult to see how this is to be avoided, and this is a point on which the French General Staff, with their logical minds, will seize. We.ask for clear instructions as to whether, at the present stage, the representatives of the General Staff are to. adhere strictly to the maintenance of the original forces mentioned in paragraph 14 above and to discourage all idea of any further expansion.. 18; A^reas. The conversations should include north-east France, southern France, North Africa and the Mediterranean basin. If an advanced air striking force is employed in the same theatre as the FieM Force, the base and L. of C. units required by the former can be found within the existing resources of the Army. If, on the other hand, the advanced air striking force and the Field Force have to operate in different theatres, additional units must be formed, for which no provision exists at present, in order to meet the needs of the Advanced Air Striking Force. : -: I:* Concentration Area.

19. The scope of the conversations, as far as the air is concerned, should include- (a) A generaL/liscussion as to the plans of the two air forceps. 15(6) A frank interchange of information as to the capacity of the two forcesat the present time and the extent to which this may be expected todevelop at as time goes on.(c) Detailed plans for the co-operation of the two air striking forces, togetherwith the administrative details necessary to enable British air forces to operate from French soil.(d) The co-ordination of the three air defence systems, including thelinking-up of the observation and warning systems.(e) Co-operation throughout the world of British and French Air forces with the naval forces of the two Powers in the protection of seaborne trade.General Discussion of Air Plans.20. With regard to paragraph 19(a) above, we have already expressed our view that an essential preliminary to any conversations must be that we should know and approve the French plan. We shall, therefore, be bound to disclose our own plans in general terms to the French. In doing so we shall have to make clear that the first commitment of the Royal Air Force is the defence of this country against air attack. We have already stated in our Report on the Military Implications of German Aggression against Czechoslovakia, the extent to which the Metropolitan Air Force at present falls short of the standard which will be necessary to enable it to conduct effective operations on a major war scale, and in our Appreciation of the Situation in the Event of War in the Mediterranean and Middle East* we made clear our numerical inferiority vis-a-vis Italy in North Africa. The result of this will be that in the near future, and for some time to come, the whole effort of our air striking forces at home and in the Middle East will be confined to action to reduce the scale of attack oh this country and on Egypt respectively. We are at present, and for some time are likely to remain, too weak to defend ourselves effectively; we shall, therefore, have no margin of air power in hand to enable us to assist in the defence of France, except in so far as any action to reduce the scale of attack on England will automatically contribute to the defence of France. We shall in any event be in no position to co-operate in any offensive operations that the French may be contemplating.Existing Capacity and Rate of Development of the two Air Forces.21. With reference to paragraph 19 (b) above, it follows from&apos;the above that it would be essential for each side to the discussions to be thoroughly acquainted with the present strength and efficiency of the other&apos;s air forces and the resources behind them. In particular, the offensive action of the two Air Striking Forces could not be usefully discussed without a complete knowledge of the numbers and capacity of various types of aircraft of each Air Force, and the consequent scale of attack which they might be expected to develop against objectives in enemy country. We think it possible that the French may have an exaggerated idea of our present real strength in the air, and, in informing them of the strength and efficiency of the Air Force at the present date, we should inevitably reveal a number of weaknesses which will not be eliminated until our expansion has been completed and deficiencies in personnel and equipment made good. The risk of leakage of information of this sort to the enemy is one which would have to be faced. We consider it essential that each side should have no illusions as to the real state of the other&apos;s forces, or the period for which their scale of reserves will enable them to carry out operations.Detailed Plans for Co-operation. . ;22. With reference to paragraph 19 (c) above, an extension of the scope of the conversations to cover the co-ordination of plans instead, of a mere inter-; change of information as to aerodrome and other facilities, introduces the* Paper No. C.O.S. 691.
necessity of discussing the selection of objectives and the allocation of those objectives as between the two air striking forces. This is a subject which the French have long been pressing us to discuss, and on which they have already expressed definite views. v.:The interchange of information as to targets in Germany has been going on for some time and has made good progress; and, subject to the general condition stated in paragraph 20 above, that the objectives selected will have to be those calculated to reduce the scale of enemy air attack on this country, we consider that a discussion on the selection of objectives will be essential.23. For some time to come we shall have a number of squadrons with relatively short range, which can only develop their maximum effort if they are based or have facilities for refuelling on French soil. Owing to certain shortages of personnel and equipment we shall be unable to send the complete Advanced Air Striking Force of 20 squadrons to France if war should come in the near future. But we shall have to send as large a proportion as we can maintain overseas as well as certain army co-operation squadrons.; and for this reason we must ask the French to place at our disposal as many aerodromes as they can make available, and to give us such other administrative assistance and facilities- such as transportation, accommodation, labour, signal communica-tions, medical and non-technical services as may prove requisite and possible.24. It is hardly necessary to point out that the possibility of despatching any advanced air striking force to the Continent is dependent on the full co-operation and assistance of the Army. It will be necessary for the War Office and Air Ministry to work out the details of the administrative requirements involved.Co-ordination of Air Defence Systems.25. With reference to paragraph 19 (d) above, it will be necessary to concert arrangements, as far as possible, for the co-ordination of the three air defence: systems. This includes arrangements for connecting the systems of air raid warning and intelligence; methods of routeing French and British bombers through defended zones; and a system of recognition to be used by French and British bombers operating in the area or in the vicinity of each others, or of Belgium&apos;s fighter zones or ground anti-aircraft defences.Co-operation in the Protection of Seaborne Trade.26. With reference to paragraph 19 (e) above, it will be necessary to make a thorough survey of the extent to which the air forces of each Power engaged in trade protection can best co-operate with each other and with the naval forces in the protection of shipping, not only in European waters, but in the Mediterranean and in the Far East, should Italy and Japan respectively enter the war against us.Co-operation in the Mediterranean and Middle East.27, We have so far dealt mainly with the co-operation of the two air forces in Western Europe. Should the war spread to North Africa, which we should make every effort to avoid, the necessity for close co-ordination between the action of the two air forces does not seem very likely to arise. It may, however, be desirable to discuss the extent, if any, to which French air forces in Syria could co-operate with us in the defence of Palestine or the Suez Canal.Belgium.28. Belgium has no naval forces and no exchange of information on naval matters would be necessary. The Belgians have already communicated to us unofficially the outline of their army plan, the method of employment of their small air force, and of their air observation system.The despatch of our field force to France would not necessitate the provision of either port or transport facilities in Belgium, but we should give &quot;Belgium similar information as that imparted to the French referred to in paragraphs 14 and 15 above.
We should require information as to the aerodrome accommodation which; could be put at our disposal in the unlikely event of our requiring to base certain fighter squadrons in Belgian territory. ,; , ,29. Owing to the short time available for completing this report, we must reserve the rigjit to make minor corrections, if necessary, before it is submitted to the Cabinet.(Signed) CHAT FIELD.C. L. N.
