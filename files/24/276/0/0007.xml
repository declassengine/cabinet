HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.) E CRET. v Copy No.  . .K. .p. 80(38).&quot; CABINET.AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS:    PROTECTION OF VITAL SERVICES. Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary.1.     At its meeting on 15th December last, the Cabinet authorised me to announce that the Government had accepted the principle of a contribution towards expenditure by public utility undertakings on air raid precautions additional to those falling on industry generally.  (Cabinet 47(37)Conclusion 7Q)2.      The Hopkins Committee (which I understand will shortly send in recommendations for safety precautions in regard to water supplies similar to those made for gas and electricity) has recommended grants, broadly speaking, of 50 per cent, of approved expenditure.       They recommended also that in assessing the need for, and degree of, protection for particular installations, regard should be paid to such factors as vulnerability, the impox-tance of the supply to vital industries and the size and density of the population sex-ved0       Difficulties experienced in subsequent negotiations with the gas and electricity industries have suggested that it would be best if the grant could be limited to undertakings in a cex*tain number of ai*eas (of which a provisional list of a dozen has been drawn up), selected for their importance from a defence point of view03.      For my part, I am px-prepared to accept this scheme of fixing upon selected areas provided that it is not so presented as to suggest that it is the Government&apos;s complete and final solution of the public utilities&apos; problem.       When the   i
2cnecessary Bill is introduced into Parliament (if not sooner)? there is certain to be considerable controversy over the proposed geographical limitation of grant, and I do not think it would be possible to hold to a position in which wq said that public utility undertakings outside the selected areas would not at any time or in any circumstances receive any assistance. I think that this controversy can only be successfully dealt with on the following lines:-(a) The    schemes of public utility undertakings are different from those of local authorities.    The local authorities ax*e concerned with measures for the prevention of panic, the avoidance of unnecessary loss of life and the arrangements for dealing with casualties.        These are measures fox* which provision must be made all ovex* the country.The special measures to be taken by public utility undertakings (as distinct from the measures which they, in common with industx-y genex-ally, ax&apos;e expected to take) consist of measures for keeping their services going, e.g, by, the px*otection or replacement of plants      The importance of these measures must obviously vax*y as between one area and anothex&apos;,, not only on account of varying degrees of vulnerability of different districts and works, but fox&apos; a variety&apos;of other reasons alsoe(b) The preparation of schemes to embody these measures will be a long and complicated business and, apax*t from financial considex*ations, will make considtex*able demands on labour and material and the most practical method of tackling the problem is to deal with those
3.parts of it which are the most urgent,(c) The Government have made a careful survey of the whole position and have drawn up a list of ares which,       from the point of view of national defence, it is most important to deal with urgently.(d) The Government hope that the work will be put in hand in these areas immediately with a view to the necessary schemes being begun in 1938.(e) For this purpose it has been decided to allot certain total sums fox* the assistance of gas, electricity and water undertakings respectively in th&apos; se areas.(f) As regards undertakings in other areas, the Government do not at present ask that any special measures should be taken, but they rely on the undertakings to proceed with the measures which are expected of industry generally.S.H.1st April, 1938.
