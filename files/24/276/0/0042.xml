-     THIS DOGTJMEIJT IS THE PROPERTX OP HIS BjffiFAMKEO HftJ3BTr&apos;g GOVERNMENT.SBCjKBT. &quot; &apos; Oo-jXY No.^t*CP. 115 (38)CABIEEI NURSING- HOMES REGISTRATION (SCOTLAND) BILL.1. This Bill, which was introduced by Sir Douglas Thomson, provides for the registration and inspection of nursing homes in Scotland by local authorities.     The Bill follows closely the lines of Sections 187 to 195 of the Public Health Act, 1936, which empower English local authorities to register and inspect nursing homes?,2. In Scotland maternity homes are already registered and inspected by local authorities under the Ilidwives and Maternity Homes (Scotland) Act, 1927. Since the Bill covers all nursing homes, including maternity homes, it repeals the relevant provisions in the Act of 1927.3. A number of representative bodies in Scotland are in favour of the Bill and there is no doubt that it is desirable to give Scottish local authorities the same powers to register and inspect nursing homes as are already possessed by English local authorities.4-. The Bill has received an unopposed Second Reading, and I do 5iot escpect that there will be any serious opposition to its further progress. I should accordingly be glad to have the authority of ray colleagues to adopt a friendly attitude during the Committee Stage of the Bill, arid to facilitate, as far as possible, its further progress,,VT.E.E..12 th Nay, 1938
