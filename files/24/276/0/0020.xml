THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVj3BNMSNT. SECRET. COPY NO. ^JL 3IO.P.93(5B)CABINET.AMENOEMT OF HERRING INDUSTRY ACT, 1955.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Home Secretary.1.     The Herring Industry Act, 1935, provided for the appointment of a Herring Industry Board   to.administer a scheme for the re-organisation, development and regulation of the industry Vvdth financial aid from the Exchequer.     In some respects improvement has resulted, but it is generally agreed that the Act has proved inadequate to meet the difficult conditions of the industry and we have reached the conclusion that an amending Bill is necessary.     The existing arrangements-were the subject of strong criticism from all sides when the Herring Industry Vote was deTsated on 22nd July, 1937.2.     The industry is mainly dependent on foreign markets and our herring fichermenand other sections of the industry are having a hard struggle to maintain a footingin those markets in the face of severe competition and restrictions of trade.3.     The decline in the industry is shown &quot;by the following figures:-Total Catch Number of Steamowts. Drifters.1913 11,763,000 14701929 8,264,000 11621934 4,794,000 -    9941937 5,515,000 747Thus in the bast three years the Steam Drifter Fleet has diminished &quot;by one quarter and there has been hardly any new construction.4.     Heavy wastage will continue because many of the vessels are over twenty-five years old*,     Moreover, tkey are now further handicapped by heavy costs for operation and repairs.     If the wastage continues unchecked it may &quot;become altogether excessive, and we consider that some steps towards a more up-to-date fleet are essential,     We do not, however, consider that the. construction of steam drifters
-   140should &quot;be encouraged:     they cost sver  10,000 to &quot;fcuild, a prohibitive figure., under present conditions.     In our opinion the new construction should consist of motor boats.     These cost only from  3,000 to  3,500 to build.     They are more economical in running costs and they are &quot;better able t.6 find employment, especxally in Scotland, in ether kinds of fishing in the intervals between the herring seasons.5.     The Act of 1935 envisaged the construction of new &quot;boats by means of loans. A scheme was accordingly issued by the Herring Industry Board in 1937 but attracted no applicants.     After carefully examining the position, we are satisfied that the fishermen, who have become impoverished during the long depression, require aid by way of grant as well as of loan.6.     We therefore propose, as an emergency scheme limited to a period of five years, that power should be taken to make grants to fishermen which would represent not more than 33-^ of the cost of new motor herring boats.     The scheme would provide that not more than 250 new boats should be built in the five years.     At  1,000 per boat, the estimated cost would &quot;be  250,000 spread over five years.     The proposed grants would not be available for Companies which own fleets.7.     In order to secure the further reduction of catching power which is necessary owing to /the ^contraction .of foreign markets, we propose that new motor boats    -should only be built pari passu with the elimination of steam drifters, i.e. one motor boat may be &quot;built as against each steam drifter eliminated after 1st January, 1938.     As the motor boat has only about 6C70 of the catching power of a steam drifter the scheme would automatically reduce the total catching power. 8.     The period during which loans, can be issued under the Act of 1935 for new construction and other purposes expires at 31st March, 1940.     We propose that it should be extended to an appointed date in 1943.     Out of the original loan fund of  600,000 about  107,000 has been issued, of which  61,000 has already been repaid to the Exchequer,     While the existing balance of  493,000 willm^et th  needs for loans for new construction and other purposes for about three more years further provision for loans may then be required.     We propose that the &quot;Bill should authorise such provision to be voted, as required, up to a total not exceeding  150,000.     It is estimated that before any Vote to the Fund is
is required, an equal or greater amount will have been repaid by the Board into the Exchequer.9..     In addition to these financial provisions, we propose t,o take power to reconstitute the Herring Industry Board which at present consists of three independent members and six trade members, all appointed by Ministers. The inclusion of trade members has given rise to difficulties, mainly because those members have considered on too sectional a view the questions dealt with &quot;by the Board.     lie propose that in future the Board should be composed of three independent members and that the trade members should be replaced by an Advisory Council drawn from the different sections of the industry.     This change is in harmony with the expressed views of the industry itself.10. - Hitherto 90% of the administrative expenses of the Board and the whole of their expenditure on advertising, market development, research and experiment have been met out of grants under the Act of 1955 within a statutory limit of  125,000 in three years.     We propose that grants.for these purposes should be continued for a further period of five years but at a reduced rate.     The maximum provision proposed for the five years is  125,000 of which  60,000 may be applied towards administrative expenses. The grant towards advertising etc., would be limited to a contribution of 50% of expenditure, the remainder being met from levies paid by the industry. 11.   Minor amendments which experience has shown to be desirable would also . be made in the proposed Bill.12.    The proposals have been discussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer who has assented to them.13.   We ask for authority to prepare and submit to the Home Affairs Committeea Bill giving effect to the proposals referred to in this Memorandum.- W,E*E. W.S,M.
