IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS britannic majesty is GOVERNMENT).s C R E T. i COPY NO,   ^ Q  &quot;lp.   82 (38)aCABINET.RESERVE STOCKS OF POOD AND FEEDING-STUFFS.Memorandum by the Minister for the Co-ordinationof Defence^1. At the meeting of the Cabinet on Slat July, 1937,I submitted for the consideration of my colleagues, proposals by the Board of Trade for food storage legislation (CP.  192 (37))o    The Cabinet decided, however,  to postpone a decision on these proposals until my review of expenditure on Defence Programmes had been completed,.2. .  I subsequently received the approval of mycolleagues for an interim scheme whereby Unilever would - maintain a minimum stock, of whale oil at Brorriborough for 12 months ending. 30th April. 19390    The arrangements which the Cabinet approved have since been completed with Unilever and are now only awaiting the drafting of a/formal contract,3o It will be remembered that in my memorandum of the26th January last (CVpo 15 (58)) dealing with the whale oil proposals I expressed the hope that it world be possible to negotiate arrangements with ether food trades in such a.   way   as to avoid   the need for the Government becoming a large operator on world markets,-    I have since had interviews with leading members of the flour milling industry and the sugar industry, and I am confident that satisfactory
agreements can be made to secure adequate increases of stocks of wheat and sugar without the Government itself coming into the markets as the purchaser of the additional stocks.4. Negotiations with Flour Millers. Leadingrepresentatives of the milling industry, including theCo-operative Wholesale Societies, with whom I have dis-cussed. the subject, prepared, at my suggestion, a plan for the industry to hold, in addition to their normalx.stocks, 400,000   tons of wheat so as to provide, including commercial stocks, a minimum sufficient for 14 weeks&apos;  consumption of flour.     The minimum would be reached in July immediately before the United Kingdom harvest at the end of which the stocks in this country, including the 400,000 tons, would he equivalent to 26 weeks&apos; normal consumption and about 30 weeks if the rate of extraction were raised to 85% as was done in the Great War.5. The plan prepared by the millers may &quot;besummarised as follows:-(a)     An ad hoc Committee would be set up consisting of Mr. Arthur Robinson (Robinson Brothers (Rotherham) Ltd.) as Chairman, Mr. J.V. Rank (J. Rank Ltd.), Sir Norman Vernonx This is a larger quantity than was originally-provided in plan II which was submitted with CP. 68 (57) of the 20th February 1937.      That plan included only 188,000 tons of wheat (and of flour in terms of v/heat). As a result of further consideration this quantity, i.e. about l^r weeks&apos; consumption, appeared to he too small. Corresponding reductions will be made in other items so as to keep within the same total.
(Spillers Ltd*), Mr. J. McFadyen (Director ofthe Co-operative Wholesale Society), andMr. Neil Beaton (president of the Scottish Co-roperative Wholesale Society), who would under-take the purchase of the wheat and arrange for its storage in this country throughout the whole duration of the scheme.     The meetings of the Committee would &quot;be attended by a representative of the pood (Defence plans) Department as liaison&apos; officer,(b) The actual purchase would be made on behalf of the Committee by Mra Rank and Mr. Bracey, who is the principal buyer for the Co-operative Wholesale Society.     The members of the Committee are unanimously of opinion that the whole purchase should be completed within a period of 24 hours.(c) One-half of the wheat would be purchased for delivery before the end of July next, and the other half for delivery before the end of December.(d) The whole of the 400,000 tons would be stored under the supervision of the Committee in three equal portions divided among j. Rank Ltd., Spillers Ltd.,, and the Co-operative Societies.The places where the wheat is to be actually stored would be subject to the   approval of the Government.(e) The whole Opcr-^ + ion throughout the entire run of the scheme would be carried out by members of the Committee on a non-profit making basis, thev   Board of Trade undertaking to repay actual out-of-pocket expenses for storage,  insurance and handling, and to accept the risk of market fluctuation either up or down.     The firms with whom the wheat was stored would provide the services of -their technical experts free of cost,
6D The representatives of the milling nja&amp;industry..with whom I have discussed the matter are strongly, of opinion that the present is a suitable time to make a purchase of the order contemplated,,    They attach, however., great importance to secrecy, and,  in their view,  it is essential that no indication that such a purchase is to be made should become known to anyone other than the firms with whom I have been in negotiation until after the purchases have been completedo7o Other Foodstuffs.    It is; I think, practically .certain that arrangements, similar to those above described in the case of wheat., could be made in respect-of sugar and some of the other commodities included in plan IIo    But if, as seems probable,  it is found necessary to make provision for&apos; special emergency food for use in areas which have suffered from serious .aerial, bombardment,  such, food may have to be manufactured in advance specially for the Government?80 legislation siat ion.    It: has hitherto been assumed that legislation would be necessary before .any commitment could be incurred on behalf of the Government in respect of additional food stocks, &apos;   My discussions with the representatives of both the milling arid sugar industries have confirmed ray view that this procedure would be certain to have a very disturbing influence on the food markets;    would increase the price of food to consumers generally;    and would be regarded by the leading members of the food trades as extremely undesirable,,    1^ am, therefore,  strongly of opinion that in the special circumstancesP no announcement of the Government?s intentions should be made in Parliament or
otherwise until arrangements with the various trades concerned have &quot;been completed, and all the essential purchases made.X9o If my proposals are approved by the Cabinet on 6th April, it should I think be possible within a period of about one month to complete the arrangements for the purchases by the food trades concerned.    An announcement could then be made in the House of Commons to the effect that action had already been taken which would ensure that there would be in this country substantial additions to the normal stocks of essential foods and feeding-stuffs, and that a Bill would be introduced as soon as practicable to regularise these proceedings.    In the meantime, arrangements would have to be made to enable the trades.concerned to raise the money required from the Banks.    If, as I hope, the Bill receives Royal Assent before the end of July, the Bank loans could be repaid within a period not exceeding four months in any case and in the majority of cases not longer than a few weeks.10e When the announcement is made, it will be necessaryfor the Government to give to the House an indication of the total amount which they are proposing to spend on food purchases.    If the amount is left vague, it will have a very unsettling effect on the,commodity markets and Would undo the advantages to be obtained from secret purchases in advance. The Cabinet must therefore reach some decision as to the scale of expenditure contemplated.    In my Further Report on Defence Expenditure I allowed  20 millions for the period up to 31st March, 1942, on civil defence measures (including food storage) other than Air Raid Precautions.    I consider that  15 millions of this could properly be allocated to food
storage, of which about  12 millions would be for purchases and about  3 millions for handling and other charges during the period up to 1942o    It may be anticipated that figures of this order will be criticized as inadequate by advocates of a large scale policy,,    It will, however, be impossible to conceal the figures or to leave them too vague, both for the reasons given above, ana because a supplementary estimate disclosing the figures of actual expenditure will have to be introduced as soon as the necessary powers have been obtained.    I should propose therefore to mention a figure of  20 millions for Civil Defence purposes (including food storage) other than Air Raid Precautions.SUMMARY.I recommend for the approval of the Cabinet:-(i)    that I be authorised to inform the representatives of the milling industry that, in accordance with the proposals outlined in paragraph 5 of this memorandum, they may purchase 400,000 tons of wheat, one-half for delivery in this country not later than the end of July next and the remainder in December next?(ii)    thatthe Board of Trade, in consultation with the Treasury, complete the arrangements with the representatives of the milling industry for storing this additional wheat and turning it over as necessary from time to time; v (iii)   that the Board of Trade negotiate and complete, subject to Treasury approval, contracts with the remaining food trades concerned to make approved additions to their normal stocks;
(iv)    that the Board of Trade, subject to Treasury-approval, arrange to purchase any food supplies required for special emergencies which cannot be provided under the previous sub-paragraph; (v)    that the expenditure upon the purchase (including freight) of all the additional stocks and for storage and handling charges over the period up to 31st March, 1942, should not exceed in the aggregate  15 m.    This figure is within the allowance of  20 m. which I made in my Further Report on Defence Expenditure in future years for civil defence measures other than Air Raid Precautions; [C^ -2-^/3$)) (.vi)    that a Bill be prepared forthwith to regularise these proceedings; (vii)    that I be authorised to make an announcement in the House, as soon as the need for secrecy has passed, to the effect that the Government have already taken steps for additional food storage and that a Bill to regularise these proceedings will be submitted as soon as practicable, the terms of this announcement to be agreed in advance with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade.(inVld) T.
