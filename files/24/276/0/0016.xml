THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT    4 Printed fdr the Cabinet.   April 1938.SECRET. Copy No. 42CP. 89 (38).CABINET.GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.   : )I THINK my colleagues may be interested to see the attached copies of a letter from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin and of the reply which, after consultation with the Prime Minister, I have sent to Sir Nevile Henderson.foreign Office] April 4, 1938.Sir N. Henderson to Viscount Halifaoc.Dear Secretary of State, Berlin, March 30, 1938.GENERAL TEMPERLEY, who is paying a short visit to Berlin, was asked to-day by Weizsacker (who will succeed Mackensen as No. 2 in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs) if we were prepared to go on with our conversations, as the German Government, for their part, did not regard what had happened in Austria as having affected those negotiations. Temperley replied that he knew nothing about it.I have, of course, not mentioned the subject of colonies to anybody since the 3rd March, and, unless otherwise instructed, I do not propose to do so. The next move lies in any case with the German Government, who have undertaken to put their views on our colonial proposal in writing. I imagine that we neither wish to prevent them from expressing those views nor to encourage them to do so.If I am approached on the subject, my normal reaction would be to say that I am waiting for the promised written reply, while adding that, after Germany&apos;s last display of jungle law, I find it difficult to believe that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be in the mood to think about colonies.Do you agree ? Hopeless though it looks, I would rather not bang the door, as we may one day wish to reopen it in connexion with Czechoslovakia.Yours ever,NEVILE HENDERSON.Viscount Halifax to Sir N.&apos;Henderson.My dear Henderson, ,    Foreign Office. A y?fil 4. 1938.THANK you very much fOr your letter of the SOth1 March regarding the possibility of a renewal of our conversations with the German Government;I agree that the next move lies with the &quot;German: Government. The Chancellor promised a written reply on the colonial question/and we must clearly await its receipt. I would not, however, remind the German Government of that 9815   [16995]
fact, nor press for the written reply, as I think the prospect of any action of the kind we were contemplating in the colonial sphere has necessarily receded, under the influence of recent events. The Germans, of course, do not understand-or affect hot to understand what difficulty we should, in any case,, have had with our public opinion. over the question of colonial restitution in any. form.&apos;, ,Ih present circumstances, I very much doubt whether it ,would be practical politics, unless, indeed, the German Government was prepared itself to make some real make-weight contribution. And this does not look very likely now. The line of reply, therefore, that you suggest seems the right one, if you are approached on the subject.But I should nevertheless hope that you might be able to make it in such form that would not shut the door and make it more difficult than it anyhow must be to get going again. I do not think that we ought to give up the idea of getting on to terms with them, difficult as it no doubt is. Too much depends on the chance for us to let it go, until we are quite convinced that the attempt is hopeless.There are, as I see it, two kinds of difficulty :; (1) That involved in the resumption of conversations at all in the present state of British feeling; and \  (2). That which, in any circumstances, would be created by approaching a colonial settlement in isolation.These really hang together, inasmuch as they would both be greatly eased if the Germans were really willing to aiscuss other matters. If, for example, they were prepared to talk about Czechoslovakia, and encourage us to use our good offices for a reasonable settlement, it would obviously be of great assistance. Is there any chance either of this, or of their being willing to talk seriously about clisarma-ment ? If there were, I should certainly feel it might be worth trying and we might then conceivably get to something not wholly unlike the general settlement we have always worked for. If there isn&apos;t and I fear this will be your reply  I think the only thing we can do is to prevent our relations with them getting any worse than we can avoid, do the best we can at Prague to get Benes to accept the settlement thatHenlein (on behalf of Hitler ?) would accept, and hope that later on the way may be clear, if it should still seem desirable, to deal with the colonial issue.&apos;        Yours, &amp;c.HALIFAX.
