SECRET. COPY NOC. P. 101( 38). OA BINE T.INT^KPI&amp;TIONAL LABOUR. OONVaimONS AND RECQMMEMDaTIONSj Memorandum by the Minister of labour. 1.     It has been customary to inform Parliament by means of a White Paper what action the Government proposes to take with regard to the Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference.     The last such Paper was published in March, 1936.     During the autumn I was asked five questions on the subject, and in reply to the last I promised to issue a further White Paper.2.     The most important of the outstanding Conventions concern the question of the reduction of hours of work.     A Draft Convention of principle was adopted in 2935, which requires members who ratify it to declare their approval bf the principle of a forty hour week applied in such a manner that the &quot;standard of living&quot; is not reduced in consequence, and to undertake to apply this principle in industries on which subsequent Conventions may be adopted.     Applying the principle of - this Convention the Conference adopted in 1935 and 1936 Draft Conventions concerning the reduction of hours of work in glass bottle works and in Public Works.     As my colleagues are aware the question of ratifying these Conventions has been the subject of debate in the House on more than one occasion and it has been made clear that H.M. Government is not prepared to ratify these Conventions.     It is unnecessary to reiterate arguments with which my colleagues are familiar.3.     As regards the Draft Convention regarding the hours of work in coal mineswhich was adopted in 1935, a Convention on this subject was originally adoptedin 1931 and efforts were made to arrange for its simultaneous ratification bythe seven principal coal-producing countries of Europe.     Certain technical difficulties, however, prevented its application in this and other countries andit was revised in 1935 in such a way that these difficulties were removed in sofar as this country is concerned.     It has already been stated in the house that the Government is prepared to ratify the Convention at the same time as theother six principal coal-producing countries, but in view of Germany&apos;s resigna-tion from the International Labour Organisation there, is-vary little prospect1.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVIRMiENT
-  24?of this at present.     All that seems necessary at the moment is that the White Paper should repeat that the Government is willing to ratify the Convention in the circumstances mentioned.     A Tripartite Technical Meeting on the subject of conditions in the Coal Mining Industry is at present being held in Geneva, having commenced on 2nd May.4.     A Convention dealing with the regulation of the recruiting of native workers was adopted in 1956 and the Secretaries of States for the Colonies and Dominions agree with me that we can proceed to ratify it forthwith.     A supplementary Recommendation can be accepted with certain reservations with regard to African dependencies.5.     A lengthy Recommendation regarding Unemployment among Young Persons was adopted in 1935, and, while in certain respects it either goes beyond what is- at present possible in this country or makes impracticable suggestions on points of detail, we can express a substantial measure of agreement on most points.     I propose to submit to the International Labour Office a detailed report which I have prepared in collaboration with the Departments concerned and to indicate in the White Paper that this will be done.6.     There remain two Conventions and a Recommendation with regard to which afinal decision is not at present possible but on which I think&apos; it desirableto publish a statement of the present position.     In 1929, a Convention dealingwith the marking of weights on heavy packages transported by vessels was adopted.Certain technical difficulties with regard to the interpretation of its provisions have arisen which the International Labour Office is at presentinvestigating.     In 1936, the Conference adopted a Convention and Recommendatiorconcerning annual holidays with pay.     As the report of the Committee which Iset up on this subject is at present under consideration, the White Paper need only state that on these two Conventions and the Recommendation a decision must be deferred, v7.     I ask for authority to issue a White Paper as attached.     This White Paper includes the decisions taken by the Cabinet on six Draft Conventions and two Recommendations adopted at two special Maritime Sessions of the Conference in 1936 (Cabinet 37 (37) Conclusion 13).(Intd.)
