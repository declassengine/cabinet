TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,   . ^&quot;   jIt is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.[ilS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC n/uTSSTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT E C R E T. COPY NO.43------ *r -;-;-,P. 92/38.CAB I N S T. NAVAL REARMAMENT PROGRAMME.Measures of acceleration proposed in consequence of the International Situation.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.On 12th March the Cabinet decided that in any expansion or acceleration due to the international situation priority should be given to the Air Force and to anti-aircraft defences.In conformity with this general decision I now submit for urgent consideration five measures of defence against air attack which are of the first importance from the naval point of view.(a) Underground storage of oil fuel;(b) Underground storage of ammunition;(c) The re-arming of certain old cruisers and destroyers with anti-aircraft armament for trade protection;(d) The conversion of old 12 pdr.  guns into highangle armament for the.defensive equipment of merchant ships.(e) Duplication of the R.N.Cordite Factory.It would be difficult to imagine any measures of more vital importance to the safety of the country than the first two enumerated above, since without fuel and ammunition the Navy cannot operate and the country must starve.    Equally Important is the proper anti-aircraft protection of merchant ships.The present position with regard to all these t ems/
-  13&apos;items is as follows:-(a) Underground storage of oil fuel.From many quarters the Admiralty and the Government have recently been criticised for relying on imported oil as the motive power of the Navy.     There is a good case to meet this criticism but this case depends on the assumption that an adequate safe stock of oil is available in this country:    to-day such a safe stock is not available.      To provide such a stock the Admiralty originally put forward in C.I.D. paper No. 1286B, Annex 1 a scheme for a total storage capacity of 1,932,000 tons at an estimated cost of  14 to  16 millions. The first stage of this scheme as recommended by the Chiefs of Staff in C.I.D. paper No. 1300 B, enclosure 2 comprised storage for 1,040,000 tons at an estimated cost of  7g- to  8-g- millions,    It was decided, however, that the firm orders to be placed in the first instance should not exceed a total of  3^ millions and the Admiralty thereupon prepared an initial scheme whereby they hoped to provide, within the sum mentioned, storage for 545,000 tons. As the various initial schemes have been drawn up the estimates of cost have naturally become somewhat altered. The latest estimate of the cost of the full scheme has- been decreased to  13-g- millions and that of the first stage to  7^ millions, i.e. the lower of the two estimates given in C.I.D. &quot;paper Ho. 1300B. Thefirst/
first part of the first stage,  however,  i.e.   that which the Admiralty planned to do under the  3-g millions limit is now expected to cost  4-1- millions and we have recently asked the Treasury to increase the limit to this latter figure.      So far,  however,  this has not been agreed to.      There is one other point of importance. As it has now become clear that we should save a good deal of time by putting the whole of the first stage in hand simultaneously we have warned the Treasury that we intend in the near future to ask for authority to incur commitments up to the total cost of that stage as now estimated, namely  7-g- millions.In view of the vital importance to this country and the Empire of a safe supply of oil fuel for the Navy,  approval is requested to proceed at once with the whole of the original stage I of the Admiralty oil fuel proposals.(b) Underground storage of ammunition.At their 42nd meeting on the 22nd July last the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements approved in principle the underground storage of ammunition in the United Kingdom, Malta and Gibraltar and authorised the investigation of sites.      We have not yet reached the stage of asking the Treasury for approval to incur any actual expenditure but we expect to be in a position to do so in the near future.      When this happens it is highly desirable that we should beab le/
able to^ proceed at once with the work.      ,(c). The re-armament of certain old cruisers and destroyers with anti-aircraft&apos; armament for trade protection.The work of re-arming certain old cruisers and destroyers to convert them into escort vessels for the protection of our trade against air attack is entirely governed by the production of the necessary guns, mountings and fire Control instruments.      Our unreadiness in respect of these measures for the protection of merchant shipping from attack by aircraft was recently stressed by the Chiefs of Staff in their paper concerning guarantees to Czechoslovakia (0.0.8.  698).It is consequently of great importance that the production of guns, mountings and fire control instruments should be accelerated as much as possible. . This can only be done by making extra skilled labour available so that the system of shifts may be worked.I would also point out that at their 40th meeting on the 24tn last, the Sub Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements approved the programme of anti-aircraft re-armament of the Navy as set forth in Paper D.P.R. 196, subject to the Admiralty obtaining Treasury sanction to the expenditure involved in Class II of the programme.      Class II re-armament which consists of the re-arming of old cruisers, destroyers and escort vessels referred to above, has not yet received the approval of the Treasury for the scheme as /
as a whole.     I ask for the authority of the Cabinet toproceed with the work as rapidly as possible.(&amp;) Conversion of old 18-odr- puns into high angle armament for the defensive equipment of merchant ships.The Treasury have withheld approval from the Admiralty proposal to undertake a long term programme for equipping merchant ships with H/A guns by converting old 12-pounders, which is planned on a mass production basis.     They have only agreed, at the moment, to the Admiralty arranging for production of a relatively small quantity (250 guns out of 2,200).     Apart from the fact that this piecemeal policy is more expensive than would be a comprehensive programme of conversion, we are confronted with a real difficulty in relation to the gun mountings.     If our orders are limited to what can be done in 1938, which is the most that the Treasury will agree to, without any guarantee to the firms concerned that further orders up to the full amounts tendered for will be placed, our plan to give the work to five firms working on a mass production basis is bound to fail.     It will in fact be difficult to get the firms, all of which are not normally engaged on armament work, to come in at all.     I therefore seek Cabinet authority to placing orders for gun mountings involving a commitment of  925,000 in addition to the  75,000 included in the 1938 Navy Estimates.
X   3The/(e)    Duplication of the Royal Naval Cordite Factory.Those of my colleagues who are members-of theCommittee of &quot;imperial Defence will remember that thisquestion was before the Committee on December 16thlast and was remitted for further consideration to theauthorities concerned.    The present position is thatthe Admiralty are anxious to establish an alternativeCordite Factory at Caerwentthat money has been takenJin the current Navy Estimates for the purpose, but that financial approval to the expenditure has not yet been given. I understand, that the matter was submitted to the Chancellor of the Exchequer by the Treasury some weeks ago, and there the matter at present rests.      In asking that a decision in this matter should be given,  I would emphasise that our present peacetime policy of relying upon one source of production may well prove fatal, in war.Frequent attention to this matter has been drawn in recent Admiralty Progress Reports presented to the C.I.D.The last measure to which I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues is not concerned with anti-aircraft defence but it is a matter of no less importance, namely the modernisation of capital&apos; ships.
The number of battleships -which have been withdrawn from service for the essential process of modernisation is and will be a source of naval weakness for the next 18 months    The dates of completion of the ships could be accelerated by some three to six months if the labour for.continuous shifts could be made available now and materials and equipment accelerated.    In the view of the Admiralty this is the outstanding naval contribution which could be made to the speeding up of our re-armament and to our strength in the immediate future.    Not only would the action proposed increase our numbers of capital ships by 25f&amp; during 1939, but our strength in this category would be increased to an even greater extent.The question of additional labour will -doubtless receive consideration in the course of the enquiry which the Minister for Coordination of Defence and the appropriate supply officers of the three defence services are now making and my only purpose in mentioning this vitaL question now is to give my colleagues a,complete picture of the immediate measures which can and ought to be taken so far as naval service is concerned.I attach a statement showing the financial Effect of these proposals.All these measures are of such vital importance &apos;that I consider that the necessary/financial
financial provision must be made irrespective of the figure proposed for the Admiralty ration as to the inadequacy o  which I have already made representations to the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.(Intd.)    D.CADMIRALTY.8th April-,. 1938.
