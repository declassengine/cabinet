THIS   DOCUMENT   IS   THE   PROPERTY   OF   HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY fS   GOVERNMENT.SECRET. COPY WO,CP. 97(38). CABINET.UNEIvgLOYIvlENT   ASSISTANCE. .Increase in allowances on account of the increased priqe of commodities during the Tifinter - proposed withdrawal.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.      In October last the Unemployment Assistance Board decided to authorise their officers to deal by way of increased allowances with any cases of hardship among applicants for unemployment assistance which might otherwise arise owing to the increased price of commodities and the coming of winter. As the result the allowances to some 260,000 out of about 550,000 persons were increased by an average amount of about 2/- a week - the increase not exceeding 4/- a week in any class of cases.     The increased allowances were in practice confined to cases in which a household was mainly deioendent upon unemployment assistance.2.     The Unemployment Assistance Board have no legal power to continue these increased allowances;    of the two factors which justified them, one - the winter - has passed, and the other - the increased price of commodities - is passing,     The cost of living&apos; index number stood at 151 in November 1936, when ; the Board1s Regulations came into operation and at 160 when the increased allowances were made in November, 1937.     The figure for March 1938 was 156 and for the 1st April was 154.    ,3.     In these circumstances the Unemployment Assistance Board propose to withdraw the increased allowances during May.     A copy of tine instructions upon this point to the Board1s officers is attached.4.     The Board have also informed me that they are prepared to propose a new Regulation to enable them to make appropriate increases during the winter months in future years.     Such a Regulation, without in any way prejudicing their, existing discretionary powers, would empower the Board in appropriate cases to grant increases of such amounts as appeared to be reasonable to meet special needs of a seasonal character arising out of winter conditions. 5.      In my view we should concur in both these proposals.     The alternative to a withdrawal of the existing increased allowances would be the addition to the Board1 s existing Regulations of a new Regulation under which the increases could.
A. Li It?be continued indefinitely.     There is no justification upon merits for such a step and if it were taken it would necessarily be followed by the grant of increased allowances on a much wider scale than at present.      It is, moreover, of interest to observe that if taken it would make permanent the present situation in which so large a proportion as two-fifths of the applicants for unemployment allowances receive payments at rates above their respective rates of unemployment benefit.     Nor would such a step avoid the recurrent and reasonable pressure for some permanent provision in the Board&apos;s Regulations for winter allowances to avoid hardship.     While it is inevitable that the withdrawal of the increased allowances should provoke emphatic protests I believe that the policy will be accepted as necessary and sensible.     Moreover,&apos; I should expect that the proposed Regulation (to enable the grant of winter allowances in future) will take much of the sting out of opposition.
ANNEX. A. /5al 3 0UNBtigLOrMBNT   ASSISTANCE   BOARD   CIRCULAR   INSTRUCTION.   . Adjustment of allowances.In October last the Board directed the attention of officers to the circumstances likely to be created in certain households by the approach of winter combined with the fact that the prices of certain commodities were going up, and instructed them to have regard to these circumstances in considering cases as they fell due for review.Officers-must necessarily have regard to the circumstances obtaining at the time when they are dealing with new cases or periodically reviewing current cases in which additions have been given.     The winter season has now come to an end and the price of commodities has been falling for some time.      Additions solely on the grounds referred to in the preceding paragraph would not therefore now be justified.This instruction, however, does not affect the general discretionary powers which officers always retain to adjust allowances to meet the special circumstances of the individual case and officers should have careful regard to such circumstances when considering on review cases in which an addition has been made.     There will no doubt be cases where on such review the officer will be justified in maintaining the existing allowance or in reducing it by less than the full amount of the previous addition.The Board desire that applicants should be given an explanation of the grounds of any adjustment made under this instruction.     At least one week&apos;s notice should normally be given before any addition or part of an addition previously made is withdrawn under&apos;this instruction so that applicants may have opportunity to appeal to the Appeal Tribunal if they so desire.The additions made normally range in amount from Is. to 3s.     Exceptionally in a few cases additions in excess of 3s. have been made, the maximum addition in any case being 4s.     The withdrawal of additions of 2s. or more should in general be spread over a period of not less than two weeks after the notice referred to in the previous paragraph has been given.28th April,  1938. H.Q.900-65 D.H.
