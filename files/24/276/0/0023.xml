THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT185Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1938.SECRET. CP. 96 (38).CABINET.VISIT TO AUSTRALIA OF THE LORD PRIVY SEAL.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I AM sure that my colleagues will be interested to read the enclosed notes sent to me by the Lord Privy Seal regarding his recent visit to Australia, when he represented the Government at the celebrations connected with the 150th Anniversary of the founding of New South Wales. His suggestions are receiving-careful inter-departmental consideration, and some are already being acted upon.M. M.April 12, 1938.Visit to Australia, 1938.I ARRIVED at Fremantle on the 11th January and left Darwin on the 21st February, and during that time I paid visits to each of the Australian States and also to Canberra. The tour was, therefore, hurried; but I naturally.met a great number of people of all types and classes, and had an opportunity of forming a number of impressions. It is, however, a number of impressions that I venture to offer, rather than an official report.If their tone is sometimes critical, it is only because it is more useful to draw attention to weaknesses rather than to concentrate on praise.1. Foreign Affairs.Interest in foreign affairs seems to be increasing. There are, for instance, a fair number of societies such as branches of the Institute of International Affairs in most of the capitals, and this year a summer school was held at Canberra, where Ministers and others spoke on the international situation. The newspapers generally contain full reports of foreign events their news is frequently published by arrangements with English papers such as The Times or The Telegraph. I think this arrangement is to be welcomed, as it ensures that Australia^ foreign news is accurate and is received from British sources. It was interesting that, even in country districts, people almost always asked me to speak on the international situation.Australians have a genuine fear of Japan and of her turning her attention to Australia if only in the somewhat distant future, and this has developed a healthy realisation of Australia^ dependence on outside help. The question was often asked &apos;&apos; How long will England go on tolerating Japanese insults ? &quot; But, while the average Australian is, perhaps, rather puzzled at the present state of affairs, he shows no strong disposition to criticise our policy, but rather a desire to understand it and support it where possible.Less interest is naturally taken in European matters; Australians generally are vaguely in sympathy with efforts to meet Germany&apos;s &quot;legitimate&quot; claims, including the return of some of her former Colonies, provided, of course, there Is no mention in this connection of New Guinea. On the other hand, there if [17049] ijCopy No.46
2a section of opinion urging that a strong stand should be made against the dictators and that no concessions should be made to them. , Mr. Hughes is the mouthpiece of this section, and indulges on occasion in indiscreet references to the &quot;robbers,&quot; which causes his colleagues some embarrassment.Particular interest is. taken in the Dutch East Indies, ,which are regarded as the first line of Australia^ defence against Japan. The Dutch are nervous and are making rapid progress with their armaments. Thereare reports, which seem to be well-founded, of wholesale penetration by the Japanese in the islands. The Australians are most anxious to co-operate with the Dutch, and for this reason they attach special importance to Lord Gowrie&apos;s forthcoming visit to the Netherlands East Indies, to the presence of the Dutch ships at the Centenary celebrations and to the grant to the K.N.I.L.M. of facilities for the operation of an air service to Australia.Unless there are strong reasons against it on other grounds, co-operation between the military, and even more the air authorities at Singapore and in the Dutch East Indies, would be most welcome; in fact, I understand that Air ViceTMarshal Tedder (who is in charge of the Royal Air Force station at Singapore) may be suggesting methods for increased co-operation, particularly with regard to the procedure for permission for flights of service aircraft.At the last election the Labour party advocated the policy of &quot; Isolation.&quot; This plank was, however, adopted by the Labour party caucus nearly a year before the election, and it had no chance of popular support at the time when the election was held. I had some talks with Labour leaders; they did not seem to show any enthusiasm for the policy, and were as anxious as Ministers to co-operate with us in matters of foreign affairs and defence.2. Defence.Australia has, as you know, been working at the problem of defence, but the rate of progress has been slow. Little has been done, and it will be a long time before the present programme is completed. For example, it will be another three years before the Lithgow arms factory will be turning out Bren guns; Darwin at present only has 6-inch guns, and, even so, when the visit of the Dutch warships was being arranged it was a matter for speculation whether the guns would be able to return the salute. It will be two years before the 9 - 2-inch is ready. There has also been a serious delay in the production of aircraft.The poor standard of the Royal Australian Air Force and the small number and inadequate character of their machines were painfully obvious at the review of the military forces held at Sydney.I visited the arms factory at Lithgow, which is under an excellent and enthusiastic manager and is efficient at its present somewhat limited tasks. But at present they only work one shift a day and 44 hours a week : 500 men are at present employed where there is room for 2,000. There is, moreover, a shortage of skilled labour, and the result is that the output is very slow. On the other hand, the factory appears to have a good supply of small arms, and it is.satisfactory to note that they are furnishing both India and New Zealand with service rifles.There is a tendency among Australians, with their habitual optimism, to be content with the present defences, but a number of Ministers, particularly Mr. Lyons, Mr. Hughes, Mr. Menzies, Mr. Casey and Mr. Thorby, are seriously disturbed at the position and anxious to expedite the programme. I had a good many talks with them all, and tried to impress upon them that time was the important factor. Casey eventually said that he would be prepared to go up to  15 million, if not to  20 million, next year.Air expansion is held up by the difficulties in delivery from the United Kingdom, and the delay which will take place before the local factory will be producing machines on an appreciable scale. It might be helpful for the ^Commonwealth Government to send more personnel for training and service in the United Kingdom and Singapore, and to build up a large and properly trained reserve of flying officers in Australia greatly in excess of needs based on the actual number of machines at present available. In the meantime, we really ought to send them a few, at any rate, of the latest type of British machines as also some of the latest type anti-aircraft guns (either 3-7 or 4-5). Thorby would be delighted to stop making the N.A. 33, and would do so if we would tell them what to make and let them have the prototypes. I place great emphasis on the point.  Our inability to send them anything is doing great political harm, and the
sooner we can let them have something, the better. I know the position here at home. On the other hand, prototypes would be of great value, as they have productive capacity which might be utilised at once. It does seem a tragedy if productive capacity, either in aeroplanes or in A.A. guns, is not to be used in full.A suggestion that some Australian unit, whether infantry, an anti-aircraft, battery, or one or more squadrons of aircraft should be stationed at Singapore deserves sympathetic consideration. This would be most valuable from the psychological point of view, and the arrangement would certainly be welcomed by some of the Australian Ministers, and all, I think, of their Services. It will make them feel that they are part of the larger show.3. Migration.Largely for defence reasons, but partly also because of the return of prosperity, most Australians are anxious to see a revival of British migration in some form or other. There is, however, strong opposition to any scheme for wholesale settlement, and an insistence that &quot; this time &quot; migrants must be very carefully selected before they leave England. In many quarters, where a vague enthusiasm is shown for restarting the flow of British migrants, questioning reveals that they are only in favour of migrants in very small numbers and in certain very limited categories such as children as farm workers, skilled workmen or domestic servants.It is satisfactory to note that, in spite of the lack of co-operation from some of the States, migration is a matter in which the Commonwealth Government are prepared to take a lead and that they do not propose to make the constitutional difficulty an excuse for inactivity on their part.There is still a tendency for the average Australian to think of migration as a favour to this country. The line, therefore, that I took was that migration must be regarded as part of the wider problem of how the Empire&apos;s white population -both rural and urban should be redistributed, and should not be thought of as a question of sending out surplus population from the United Kingdom. In fact, that surplus does not exist and, in particular, it is difficult for us to spare skilled workers at this stage, though naturally we should always want to help them.Three suggestions might perhaps be worth considering :Firstly, could not a determined effort be made to recapture some of the old colonising spirit of past generations % It would not necessarily be easy and would need a strong dead and something like a real campaign in our schools and universities. But at the present moment so many young men leave school or university in this country and then go into wretched jobs in the city or on the Stock Exchange, young men who could lead far fuller and more useful lives in a country such as Australia. They would bring in capital and employ labour, and their presence should, therefore, not be resented. It would be a distinct advantage if they could receive a university or at least an agricultural college training, and they might thus act as a leaven on the rest of Australian society.Secondly, United Kingdom industrialists might be further encouraged to set up secondary industries in Australia and to offer appointments to persons from this country.Thirdly, could not Australia help both herself and central Europe by taking more migrants from such countries as Poland, Jugoslavia, and to-day from Austria1?      -4. Trade.The development of secondary industries in Australia has already gone some way, and should receive every encouragement from us. The attitude of pained surprise that Australians should be so unpatriotic as to wish to make things for themselves instead of buying them from the United Kingdom still obtains to a surprising extent among United Kingdom industrialists. A number of United Kingdom firms have established factories in Australia, but very few are far-seeing enough to wish to work in with Australian industry instead of against it and thus extract advantage instead of disadvantage -from the rapid industrialisation which is now taking place.One obvious case of failure to co-operate is afforded by the motor-car industry. Some twelve years ago the Commonwealth Government decided to encourage the establishment of a body-building industry in Australia, and imposed substantial [17049] B 2
duties on imported bodies. The only existing body-building plant in Australia shortly afterwards got into difficulties. Thebusiness was offered at a very low price both to Austin and to Morris; but neither firm would consider the proposition. Shortly afterwards it was bought up by General Motors. General Motors are believed to have lost very heavily during the firsts few years; but they &quot;have by now not only recovered all their losses, but made very large profits. There is now no concern in Australia capable of turning out bodies for United Kingdom cars at anything like the price for which General Motors, owing to their large output and the fact that much of their overhead is carried in the United States, can turn out bodies for American cars. Although, therefore, the United Kingdom manufacturers have a large and effective preference on the importation of chassis into Australia, all, and more than, this advantage is lost by having to pay either heavy duty on an imported body or else more than the exporter of American cars has to pay for bodies manufactured in Australia.If the United Kingdom industry had shown even half as much initiative, enterprise and readiness to invest money with a view to the future as their American rivals have done, they might have held as predominating a position in this very important market as the Americans now do. It is true that they were handicapped by the fact that the type of car suitable for use in the United States was equally suitable for use in Australia, whereas the British car of ten or fifteen years ago could not stand up to Australian conditions. The fact that some United Kingdom firms have for the last two years been producing cars which easily compete on merits (but not on price) with any comparable American car suggests that this difficulty need not have been insuperable. Indeed, had it been possible for two or three of the leading firms to co-operate, it would probably have been well worth their while, for a market which now absorbs 60,000 new cars per annum, to have jointly manufactured a special car for export. But apart altogether from the question of type, there is the lack of service from British firms. I heard the same story in East Africa and also in Scandinavia. And in every one of these countries they want to buy British. One Australian farmer told me that he had never had a foreign car before, but that at last he had been driven to it by lack of service. The matter might seem trivial to us, but it had been a real blow to him and he resented our traders having driven him to what he obviously felt to be an act of disloyalty! Here, again, the Americans were ready to invest what was no doubt a very considerable amount of capital to establish a complete service and spare-parts organisation throughout Australia, and they have reaped their reward. If it was beyond the financial capacity of any single United Kingdom firm to do the same, it would surely not have been impossible for two or three firms, however much they might be rivals in the home market, to co-operate with a view to establishing a joint service organisation.It is no use for United Kingdom industry to say that it cannot give service because it has not got the market. The answer is that it will not get the market until it gives service.Similar considerations arise in the case of the aircraft industry. Douglas Stinson and Lockheed aircraft are finding their way into the Australian service, with monotonous regularity., There is, moreover, no representative of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors in Australia who could even give the appearance that a serious co-operative effort was being made by British aircraft constructors in face of the severe competition which they have to meet.The lesson that United Kingdom manufacturers must learn from this is that they must seize now the opportunity which is rapidly slipping from their grasp to establish themselves in the Australian market before it is too late. Co-operation between individual United Kingdom manufacturers is essential for this purpose. It should be impressed on motor manufacturers here that unless they are prepared to make a really serious effort at co-operation in supplying the Australian motor i, car market, then we shall not be prepared to support any more of their representa-tions to the Commonwealth Government for tariff concessions.5. Government Houses.The Governors in Australia are generally most popular and are doing excellent work..&apos; There seems to be little real feeling outside the platform of the Labour Party against the system of &quot;imported&quot; Governors. It should be remembered, however, that the more thoroughly the State Governors do their
job, the more stress they inevitably lay on State rights and the more difficult becomes the task of making Australia an effectively united nation. Should they not be given some guidance on such a matter ?Government Houses are at present partly a Government Department and partly an island for an English clique, to a certain extent divorced from the life of the people. It struck- me rather forcibly that they must try and make for themselves a new position more in sympathy with the democratic conditions of Australia, and that this implies perhaps more adjustments affecting their staffs rather than any great alteration of the attitude of the Governors themselves. In spite of the difficulties referred to below, we seem to have a first-rate lot of Governors. But none of the Governors is able to live on his emoluments, and the passage allowance paid by the United Kingdom Government is quite inadequate to meet their costs. An increase in this allowance would be one way of helping them, as it could be done without asking more from the Australian authorities or creating constitutional difficulties by making direct payments from United Kingdom funds to their salaries. Another would be to reduce the cost of A.D.C.&apos;s by allowing them to continue to draw their service pay. (I understand that in India the A.D.C.&apos;s are not paid by the Governors, but from the Military Secretary&apos;s grant.)The present system of appointing A.D.C.&apos;s from the Services is not good. It tends to produce an unsuitable type by selecting a man who has no permanent interest in the country, and only regards his service as a pleasant interlude in his Army career. On the whole, the average A.D.C. seems to have little contact with the life of the town in which he lives.At the present moment not only are we missing the chance of making the most of our Governors and of Government House as a centre of life in the Capital city of each State, but a certain amount of active harm is being done. Incidentally, I wonder they get any A,D.C.&apos;s considering what they are paid  e:g.,  200 or  250.6. Celebrations.The Celebrations were well done; the authorities concerned did not make the mistake of making them too pretentious, and the result was that they compared favourably with anything of a similar character in this country, such as the Silver Jubilee or the Coronation festivities. The landing of Captain Phillips was performed with excellent taste and obvious care for historical accuracy. It could easily have been a fiasco, but was, in fact, first rate. The pageant of Australia^ march to nationhood was really admirable; it had&quot;colour, imagination and dignity.The Commonwealth Government did everything possible to make my visit enjoyable and a success. They attached a senior and most helpful member of the Prime Ministers Department for the whole of the tour, and appointed a Federal Minister to be in attendance in each State. I cannot express too highly my gratitude to the Commonwealth Government for all the arrangements made; they spared neither trouble nor expense.7. General.One cannot help being impressed by the many English qualities of the Australian people and at their pride in being British. On the other hand, one finds quite a number of signs of American influence; especially in Sydney. On the trade side, as I have already said, this is mainly our own fault. And we should remember that Australia is a materialist country, and that the next stage to being forced to buy American is to think and feel American.The visit of the Imperial Airways Flying boat &quot; Centaurus &quot; was warmly welcomed in all the States &quot;in Australia, and was in many ways a great success. There was^ however, universal criticism by all those who were taken for flights at the lack of ventilation. It was explained to me that the ventilation apparatus had been taken off in order to increase the fuel-carrying capacity of the plane. This was not, however, made clear to the passengers themselves, and the incident seems to me yet another example of our national characteristic of poor showman-ship. The less said about the five R.A.F. Flying Boats the better. But no cruisers and five Flying Boats that were always going wrong was not very impressive.
Australians have had a hard struggle. Unless they came of tough stock!, they could never have prevailed over the conditions they have had to face; Their courage and vitality are wonderful. But both circumstances and the stock that was needed to meet those circumstances have combined to produce a nation that lacks culture to an appalling degree. The interest of life is in the daily struggle, or in^the amusement that is the escape from that struggle.And yet I could not help feeling frequently a real hunger for something more. The extent to which they apologise for their accent or their crudity, press one to read any book that seems to try to understand them and the reception that they give to visiting artists I mention Malcolm Sargent as an example all this shows that they are in a state of mind to be helped. Anything that we can do to help or encourage their students or graduates to come home, or to send our schoolmasters or dons to them, would be worth while considering. We might also usefully examine the possibilities of exchanging civil servants on a temporary basis. And finally, anything that we can do to help in arranging visits from artists, musicians, lecturers, going as lowr as scientists or politicians, would be immensely worth while. The British Council has an organisation for this kind of work and its terms of reference include the Dominions. I would suggest that a special grant should be allotted to the Council specifically for this. Australia is essentially a country well worth taking trouble to help to the next and, I hope, rather less purely material stage of her development.
