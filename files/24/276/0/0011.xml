Paper No. 1407-B.)(Previous reference : OLD. Minutes of the 279th Meeting, Minute 4.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note by the Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries, covering a Memorandum prepared in collaboration between the Air Ministry (Intelligence) and the. Department of Overseas Trade (Industrial Intelligence Centre) on the German Aircraft Industry (OLD. Paper No. 1407-B).Mr. St. QUINTIN HILL, at the Chairman^ request, introduced the Memorandum. He said that information received since the preparation of the Memorandum tended to confirm its accuracy, and, in particular, the surmise that the maximum rate of output had not yet been reached. There were indications of further rationalization of the industry, whereby only firms selected by the German Government would in future be permitted to design and submit new types of military aircraft, other firms being compelled to produce types designed by the selected firms and approved by the Government. If this reorganization were effected it might at first slow down the rate of output; but this result would only be temporary, since the firms reported to have been selected as designers all held a considerable number of spare sets of jigs and gauges for types already approved.SIR THOMAS INSKIP drew attention to the conclusion in paragraph 8 (b), which stated that &quot; the apprentice training system adopted in Germany to increase the reserves of skilled labour is taking effect in reducing one of the most serious obstacles to the industry&apos;s further expansion.&quot; We, in this country, had no similar system for training apprentices. He had recently received suggestions, one of which came from the Engineering College at Loughborough,,regarding the importance of instituting some system of this kind in order to increase the skilled labour in the aircraft industry. He himself thought such a scheme was eminently desirable, having regard to the big gap between the capacity resulting from the Deficiency Programme and that required for the War Potential.LORD SWINTON pointed out that all the large aircraft firms in this country had their own arrangements for training apprentices, and he gave figures of the numbers of apprentices under training at certain big firms. Every man who was trained was being rapidly absorbed and he considered that a Government scheme for training apprentices would cut right across the excellent work now being,-.done by the firms. He explained that in Germany the mechanics for the Air Force were trained by firms, and that no institution equivalent to the Halton training establishment existed.Mr. ORMSBY GORE suggested that full particulars&quot; should be obtained as to the number of apprentices being trained by aircraft firms.SIR-SAMUEL HOARE agreed that this ought to be done.   He drew attention to the large discrepancy between our own and the German aircraft production; the latter being about 500 air frames and 1,000 aero engines a month, [16980-2]
whereas our production figures for last month were only about 118 air frames and about 250 engines.Mr, HORE-BELISHA considered that the situation was most alarming. We had now decided to place production practically on a war footing, and in due course Parliament and the country would wish to know, the result of our efforts. He believed that the increase in German production not only affected aircraft but other armament store, e.g., guns. It would be seen from Appendix III of the Report that it had been possible for Germany to double her production within a year, and from paragraph 4, that the figures of labour employed in aircraft production had been increased by 22,000 in about ten months. We, however, were told that it was not possible to bring new capacity into production, even if the designs were approved, within a period of two years.LORD SWINTON remarked that aircraft production in this country could be increased, if labour could be arbitrarily transferred from one place to another, as was done in Germany.Continuing, Mr. HORE-BELISHA drew attention to the enormous building programme being undertaken in Germany. This had been, and was being, carried out with speed, despite the fact that we were always being told that Germany was short of raw materials. He could not understand why in this country new production could not be got into being in less than 2 years. It seems that our organisation was not resilient.LORD SWINTON pointed out that our figures for airframe construction had recently come down owing to the change-over to new types. He raised the question whether the figures given in paragraph 2 of the Report represented actual output or capacity. He understood the German figures to represent a single shift capacity. ;Mr. St. QUINTIN HILL and Mr. MORTON explained that the German figures represented actual deliveries on a single shift basis.SIR THOMAS INSKIP quoted from the letters he had received regarding the necessity for instituting an apprentice training scheme in this country, and LORD SWINTON undertook to ascertain, in consultation with Sir Bruce Gardner, the exact position as regards training apprentices by aircraft firms.SIR THOMAS INSKIP thought it would be useful if the Secretary of State for War would also ascertain the -position as regards the training of apprentices in the Munitions Industry.Further discussion ensued on the present disparity between our own and the German aircraft production.LORD SWINTON, in reply to a question by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, explained that, assuming skilled labour to be available, our output figures would rise to 500 a month in about 12 months&apos; time. The figures of actual output at one time had been over 250 a month, and the recent drop was due to a change-over of types.Mr. ORMSBY GORE said that the fact that it took 2 years to bring new production into being was no excuse for doing nothing at all.Mr. HORE-BELISHA thought that we should be quite candid in regard to our own deficiencies, in view of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement as to the intensification of our own efforts and the assurance of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that this would not be held up by finance. He understood that, even if all the labour was available, we could not get additional new production into being for 2 years.LORD SWINTON said that.this was not so in the case of aircraft. Labour was required to man the factories and plant already in existence, and it was not a case of erecting and equipping new factories.SIR THOMAS INSKIP agreed that the Report on the German Aircraft Industry was startling as showing the degree to which production had been accelerated.
- Mr. BRUCE said that Australia was vitally interested in this&apos; question: They had embarked on a Defence Programme at a cost of  43,000,000 and when the Australian Defence Council had met recently, they were, appalled at the -delays being experienced in obtaining certain equipment from the United Kingdom. For example, Australia had ordered 50 aircraft from, the United Kingdom for delivery this year, but had been informed that this type&apos; had been! scrapped and deliveries of another type would not be possible until next, year and these even only at the expense of the United Kingdom requirements. Again, a great deal had been spent on coastal defence artillery, but, the equipments; supplied could not be used owing to the delay in getting instruments from this country. -The atmosphere in the Australian Defence Council had been that it was futile to spend large sums of money on equipment which did not materialise. From the Australian, as well as from the Imperial point of view, the position was terribly serious.SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested that the Report on the German Aircraft Industry now under consideration should be reported to the Cabinet.SIR THOMAS INSKIP agreed, and considered that the Minutes of the discussion should also be sent forward.Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed :-(a) That the Memorandum on the German Aircraft Industry, prepared in collaboration between the Air Ministry (Intelligence) and the Depart-ment of Overseas Trade (Industrial Intelligence Centre) (C.I.D. Paper No. 1407-B), should be remitted to the Cabinet.(b) That further consideration should be given to the question of anapprentice training system with a view to increasing the supply of skilled labour. As a first step, the Secretaries of State for War and Air should ascertain and report the present position as to training of apprentices by munitions and aircraft firms respectively.* * *        *   * / * *&apos;jiB.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, March 31, 1938.

[F.C.I. 112.]ENCLOSURE TO ANNEX.&quot;   German Aircraft Industry.Memorandum prepared in collaboration between the Air Ministry (Intelligence) and the Department of Overseas Trade (Industrial Intelligence Centre).I. Estimated Activity in April 1937.Our last report estimated the rate of output of the German aircraft industry at the end of April 1937 at About 445 airframes per month. About 890 aero-engines per month.Since the above report was compiled very valuable information has been received from a highly qualified English engineer who visited some of the chief German factories in the summer of 1937. His observations and views on the condition and output of the industry support the general accuracy of these estimates.2. Estimated A ctivity in December 1937.Although somewhat less information than usual has been received on the activity of the industry subsequent to our last report, it has sufficed for a revision of the tables of output by factories, which have been brought up to date and are attached as Appendices I and II to the present report. From these Appendices it appears that the rate of output at the end of December 1937 may be estimated at About 500 airframes per month. About 1,010 aero-engines per month.These figures, which include all types of aircraft, may be conservative, since there is no information upon which to base an estimate of the output of two important factories assembling complete aircraft built recently which are believed to have begun delivering complete aircraft of military types.3 Past Development of the Industry. - &quot;A chart is attached to this report as Appendix III illustrating the growth of output of the German airframe and aero-engine industry since this series of reports began in 1933. It shows the steady increase in production which has continued without interruption, save during the first six months of 1936, when a set-back occurred, now known to be due to difficulties in regard to engine design and production, which have since been overcome.4. Labour Employed. ,The German system of manufacture of airframes by major components for assembly at one or more central factories in each group,&apos; which has now been universally adopted in principle for the manufacture of military types, and the difficulty of separating apprentice learners and hands engaged on design and experiment from those actually engaged in the production of aircraft for immediate delivery makes it very hard to give a figure of labour employed which can usefully be compared with the estimated output.In our last report the labour employed was estimated at On Airframes   .......      ......      (c.) 48,500On Aero-engines ...      ......      (c.) 18,850Total        .............      (c) 67,350Based on the same principles of calculation and analysis of reports received, the figures of labour employed on the 1st January, 1938, were : On Airframes   ...      ...      ...      ...      (c.) 62,950On Aero-engines ...       ...       ...      (c) 26,050Total ......      ... (c.) 89,000
These figures, however, do not include the labour employed at several factories, about which no recent reports have been received, and there is little doubt that the total labour in the airframe and aero-engine factories of Germany, including apprentices and designing staff, is now in the neighbourhood of 100,000.It is by means of the apprentice learners included in this figure that Germany is beginning to build up arr important reserve of skilled labour, the shortage of which has, up to now, been a factor limiting output in emergency. It is not suggested that Germany has completely solved this problem, but, in the aircraft industry at least, she appears to have found through her apprentice system a method which is giving satisfactory results.5. Expansion of Industry.It is not yet possible to record that Germany has called a halt to her expansion of capacity. The existence of several new factories, either under construction or about to enter into production, has been credibly reported since April 1937, while the existence of others has been reported but not yet confirmed.A noticeable feature of building policy appears to be the standardisation of production units of moderate size employing 4,000 to 5,000 hands. It is unlikely, for instance, that units of the size of the Junkers complex at Dessau will be considered, in future plans.Again, the policy is being developed, though not yet, it is true, carried out in many cases, of confining the work of each firm in experiment and design to a separate establishment, leaving factories engaged in production free to concentrate on the special technique of rapid and economic output. This principle is known to be the ideal aimed at in regard both to airframes and aero-engines.6. Raw Material Supply.Whereas it is impossible entirely to disregard all the reports received that mention a shortage of raw materials of various kinds at aircraft factories, it is not apparent that output has suffered to any appreciable extent as the result of such a shortage. There have been recurrent difficulties in obtaining certain ferro-alloys for engine manufacture, but it is probable that in most cases delays in supply have been due to the cumbersome machinery of the control commissions rather than to an actual lack of the materials in question, while in other cases it is possible that the weapon of withholding raw materials has been deliberately used to bring pressure to bear on firms showing reluctance to fall in with Govern-ment policy.7. Manufacture for Export.German trade returns for 1937 show the figures for the export of aircraft in such a way as to make it impossible to deduce accurately the quantity and value of aircraft and components exported. Moreover, exports to General Franco or on account of German air units operating in Spain have clearly been omitted.It is, however, possible to estimate from the trade returns that German exports of complete aircraft and accessories, excluding spare engines and exports to Spain, during 1937 were valued at something under  3 million as .against about  1-J million in 1936. The chief recipients of these exports are stated to have been, in order of value, Turkey, Austria, Union of South Africa, Japan, Hungary, Roumania, United States of America, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Brazil, Norway and the Netherlands.The total United Kingdom exports of aeroplanes and parts thereof, except magnetos, for the whole of 1937, is stated by the Customs and Excise Department to have been  3,676,493, compared with  2,924,720 for the whole of 1936. Thus, whereas the value of United Kingdom exports is still above the value of similar exports from Germany, the increase in value in 1937, as opposed to 1936, appears to be much greater in the case of Germany than in the case of the United Kingdom.8. Conclusions.On the present evidence, therefore, it may be concluded that (a) The rate of output of aircraft of all types in Germany on the 1st January, 1938, was about 500 airframes per month, 1,010 aero-engines per month,[16775] &apos; b 2
on the production of which at least 89,000 hands were employed. The total labour employed in the airframe and aero-engine factories of Germany, including apprentices, designing staffs, &amp;c, but&quot; excluding those employed on accessories, cannot be much below 100,000. (6) The apprentice training system adopted to increase the reserves of skilled labour^is taking effect in reducing one of the most serious obstacles to the industry&apos;s further expansion.(c) There continues to be an expansion of manufacturing capacity.   new factory building follows the established policy of mass production by assembly of major components at certain central factories. For defence and technical reasons, a moderate-sized productive unit, employing from 4,000 to 5,000 hands, seems to be becoming standard. The separation of factories engaged on development work from those engaged on production is also a part of present policy.(d) The general restriction in the supply of raw materials for industry hashad no appreciable effect on the rate of output of aircraft.(e) Whereas German exports of aircraft cannot be ascertained with com-pleteness, such figures as are available indicate an increase of at least 85 per cent, by value over last year.
