1ST)UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   Afrit 1938.Copy No.57OFFICIAL SECRETS ACTS.CABINET.ISMemorandum by the Home Secretary.LAST June the Daily Dispatch published an article which contained an almost exact reproduction of a confidential police document circulated by the -Chief Constable of Southport to other forces for the purpose of securing the arrest of a man charged with fraudulent conversion. The document described the man and his modus operandi.2. There have been a number of cases where publication of confidential police information has put criminals on their guard or otherwise hindered the course of justice. In these cases it is probable that police officers are bribed, and it is important that every effort should be made to trace and deal with the policeman responsible for the disclosure. For this purpose it was decided in the Southport case to make use of the special powers of section 6 of the Official Secrets Act, 1920. This section makes it a criminal offence to refuse to give, on the demand of a responsible officer of police, information relating to an offence, or suspected offence, against the Official Secrets Act. The managing editor of the Daily Dispatch, under protest, supplied the name of the writer of the article, but the writer of the article refused to give any information. He was prosecuted under section 6 and fined  5. He appealed to the High Court, the main ground of the appeal being that the Official Secrets Act applies only to the divulgence of confidential information &quot; by a person holding office under His Majesty,&quot; and that a member of a borough or county police force is not such a person. The Divisional Court dismissed the appeal and held that a police officer is a person who holds office under His Majesty within the meaning of the Official Secrets Acts.3. There have been a number of articles in the Press, including such papers as the Manchester Guardian, the Scotsman, the Yorkshire Post and the Birmingham Post, contending that &quot; legislation devised to counter espionage should not become an instrument of inquisition and punishment in trifling matters in an ordinary journalisfs everyday work,&quot; and a Question has been addressed to me in Parliament asking whether I will consider the advisability of amending the Official Secrets Acts so as to confine their operation to espionage and to other actions which are prejudicial to the safety of the State.4. This is not the first time that the Official Secrets Acts have been criticised on the ground that they could be used in a manner injurious to the liberty of the Press. There was a similar agitation in 1930, and an Interdepartmental Conference was called to consider the question. The view taken by all the Government Departments was that the powers conferred by the Official Secrets Acts must continue to apply to all kinds of unauthorised communications, and could not properly be restricted to the disclosure of Naval or Military secrets. It was, however, recognised that the special power of requiring persons, under penalty, to give information in accordance with the provisions of section 6 of the Act of 1920 should only be used &apos;&apos; sparingly and where serious issues were involved.&quot; The then Attorney-General, Sir Willam Jowitt, made an announce-ment to this effect in reply to a Parliamentary Question.    He also met a[17122]b
deputation of representatives of the Press, at which he gave an undertaking that these special powers would not be used against the Press in. regard to matter which had already been published, except with the express approval of the Attorney-General or Secretary of State.5. In defending the necessity of special powers of this kind, the then Attorney-General referred to the need for exceptional powers for tracking spies, especially at times when war might be imminent. Although it was made clear to the Press that these special powers could not be confined to Naval or Military secrets, but must extend to other confidential information, I think the impression then left on the minds of the representatives of the Press was that these powers would only be used where the information disclosed was of such a serious character as to raise issues affecting the interests of the State.6. The statement made in 1930 that the special powers of section 6 would be only used &quot; sparingly and where serious issues were involved &quot; left the question of what was meant by &quot; serious &quot; in some ambiguity. From the point of view of those concerned with departmental administration or police administration the improper disclosure of confidential information is never unimportant. If an officer improperly discloses confidential information, even if the information is not of itself of great importance, the disclosure is serious because it shows that the officer cannot be trusted, and if he is not detected he may subsequently give away more important information.7. If, however, I understand aright the view of the Press, it is that, while they recognise the necessity of provisions penalising officials who disclose confi-dential information, they maintain that such an offence should normally be treated in the same way as any ordinary offence is treated; that in normal cases the prosecution should be left to get whatever information they can without having resource to the specal powers of compelling persons, under penalty, to answer police interrogation, and that the special powers of section 6 should only be used when the disclosure involves important Military or Naval Secrets or arcana imperii. For this view there is, I believe, a large measure of support. Public opinion recognises that there is a great distinction between (a) the grave official secrets to which the special procedure authorised by section 6 of the Official Secrets Act is appropriate, and (&amp;) confidential information of a less important character, such as information of which the premature publication may put an ordinary criminal on his guard.8. To make any concession to the Press in this matter of the use of the power of interrogation under section 6 of the Act of 1920 is open to the objection that bribery of public officials is notoriously difficult to detect and prove, and that, if the press had no reason to fear interrogation in the case of leakage of unimportant confidential information, there would be every inducement to certain newspapers to persist in practices which frequently hinder the detection and prosecution of criminals and which are carried out in many cases by corruption of police officers. &apos; Attached is a confidential memorandum prepared by. the Director of Public Prosecutions giving particulars of cases in. which publications in the press have been detrimental to the investigation and prosecu-tion of criminal offences. These instances are striking illustrations of the extent to which certain sections of the pj-ess will go in their efforts to secure &quot; scoops &apos;-&apos; and to get the better of their rivals. Mischievous as these activities undoubtedly are, it does not seem to me that the use of the power of interrogation under section 6 of the Act of 1920 is the right method of tackling the problem. This special power of interrogation is a weapon likely to break in the hand unless it is used only in special cases when public opinion recognises that exceptional procedure is necessary in the public interest. When a journalist publishes information which may hinder the police in bringing an offender to justice, it will, I fear, often be useless to ask him under threat of prosecution to disclose the source of his information. If such journalists frequently prefer the kudos of a prosecution, the result will be to bring section 6 into disrepute and to weaken the Governments position when in some really serious case it is necessary to approach a responsible Editor and say : &quot; The matter is so grave that we must in the national intej-est ask. you to depart from your usual practice of not disclosing sources of information, and we must call on you under section 6 of the Official Secrets Act to aid the State by giving information.&quot; .  .
Z&quot;7[17122]9. If this analysis is correct, I think that some concession must be made as regards the use of the special power of interrogation under section 6 of the Act of 1920, and, subject to the views of my colleagues, I would propose that this power should be used, not in every case where it is regarded as important from the point of view of public administration or the integrity of the public service to detect the source of the leakage, nor in every case where press disclosures tend to hamper the detection and prevention of crime, but only in exceptional cases where the information disclosed is in itself, in the judgment of the Attorney-General or the Home Secretary, of specially serious importance. If this general principle commends itself to the Cabinet, I think that the best way of dealing with the agitation would be for me to invite representatives of the Press to a Conference, at which the following points would be emphasized : (1) The use of the special provisions of the Official Secrets Acts cannot be limited to cases of espionage. There are other cases where the disclosure of official secrets may be gravely prejudicial to the national interests. Foreign Office or Cabinet secrets may be even more important than naval or military secrets.(2) It is impracticable to define by statute the circumstances in which the use of these special powers is warranted. The question whether a particular disclosure is or is not liable to be gravely prejudicial to the national interests is one which must be left to the judgment of the Attorney-General or a Secretary of State.(3) An undertaking was given in 1930 that these special powers should only be used after authorisation by the Attorney-General or the Secretary of State. We are prepared to renew that undertaking and to remind all Chief Constables thereof.(4) The recent High Court case is the only instance since 1930 of the use of these special powers, but this case is by no means the only case where there has been improper disclosure and publication of official informa-tion which comes within the definition of official secrets, and reference to the fact that these powers are available was made in a case in 1937. (A few of the more glaring examples (see Appendix) would be quoted.) That case may be regarded as a test case which has now settled the doctrine that a police officer is a person who holds office under His Majesty. The Government do not intend to use this power as a matter of routine, and are prepared to amplify the undertaking given in 1930 by saying that, save in the most exceptional circumstances the consent of the Attorney-General or Secretary of State will only be given to the use of the power of inter rogation conferred by section 6 in cases where the information disclosed is itself of serious public importance. At the same time the Government cannot given an absolute pledge and must reserve to itself the right to use this power if leakages of confidential information of an official character became so frequent or so notorious as to create a public scandal. The Govern-ment, therefore-looks to the press to co-operate by itself taking more adequate steps to stop the obtaining of &apos;&apos; official secrets &apos;&apos; from the police and other public servants, and by exercising greater responsibility in connection with the publication of matter relating to the investigation and detection of crime.10. I should like to make it clear that the action taken by the Attorney-General in the Southport case was taken with my knowledge and assent, and this memorandum has been prepared in consultation with him.11. I should be glad to obtain the approval of the Cabinet for dealing with the problem on these lines.S. H.Home Office, S.W.1,April 29, 1938. .
Memorandum of Instances in which Publications in the Press have been - Detrimental  to  the  Investigation  and  Prosecution  of . Criminal Offences.The Financial Telegraph Case.TOWARDS the end of 1930 confidential investigation was proceeding in connection with share-pushing frauds engineered by four men named Kennedy, Bowering, Godfrey and Tanfield. It was of the utmost importance that news of the investigation should not reach any of the defendants. On the enquiries being complete, a member of my Professional Staff, together with the Police Office]&apos; concerned, attended at the Guildhall on Wednesday, the 3rd December, 1930, and a private application was made to the Alderman for Warrants of arrest against three of the proposed defendants. In the issue of the Daily Mail of Thursday, the 4th December, 1930, in a prominent place appeared the following notice:  Share Pushing Charge in City.Three Warrants Issued.Early arrests are expected to follow the issue at the Guildhall, E.C., yesterday of three warrants against men accused of share pushing.Senior City of London detectives recently completed enquiries into the complaints of a large number of persons who made grave allegations against a business controlled by the three men.Before the application was made at the Guildhall the detectives attended at the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and shortly afterwards the application for the warrants was made.A large sum of money is involved in the case.City of London detectives began yesterday a search for the suspects, one of whom is believed to be in Ireland.The form of this notice would afford a distinct warning to any of the proposed defendants that he was in jeopardy, and, although in fact none of the men fled the country, there was considerable danger that they might have done so in the sense of having adopted this newspaper caution.While the issue of a Warrant of arrest may not come within the category of official secrets, it is tolerably clear (a) that the information upon which this notice was founded was corruptly obtained, and (b) that it is highly undesirable in the public interest that premature notice of the issue of a Warrant of arrest should come to light.The Drinan Case.John Drinan, an eccentric recluse, possessed of a considerable fortune, died in Nice on the 6th January, 1931. He was in all probability murdered by or with the connivance of one Joe Haiat. He left a former will by which, after some provision had been made for his only daughter, the residue of his fortune was bequeathed for the benefit of the Poor Boxes of the Metropolitan Police Courts. Haiat and his son and a Consular Officer at Nice named Charles James Beale had probably all been instrumental in forging a later will and in forging authorities for the transfer of a large portion of his stocks and shares, which forgeries were in the act of becoming effective shortly after Drinan&apos;s death. The then Public Trustee, Sir Oswald Simpkin, intervened in a civil action, which took the form of an inter pleader, and shortly after his intervention got into communi-cation with me because it appeared that serious criminal charges might arise in connection at least with the forgeries. To anticipate matters, I ultimately succeeded in securing the extradition of Beale, and he was eventually convicted in July 1932 and sentenced to 15 months in the Second Division. . &apos; On the afternoon of Wednesday, the 11th February, 1931, the Public Trustee spoke to me about the case on the telephone. I had no knowledge of the case, and after some conversation I suggested to him that it would be of great assistance .:if he could spare me a set of the papers, so that I might give a preliminary consideration to any action which could be taken by way of a criminal prosecution.APPENDIX.
&quot;V::.   5He promised to do this, and at about 5 15 that evening the papers were sent down to me in an envelope marked &quot; Personal and Confidential.&quot;These papers did not pass through my Registry on that day, and, in fact, owing to pressure of work, I did not open the envelope until about 5-45 that evening.   I left the office at about 7 p.m. and locked up the papers.On Thursday, the 12th February, 1931, in a prominent page of the Daily Mail of that date appeared the following notice : Drinan Fortune Mystery. Public Prosecutor calls for all Papers.The Daily Mail understands that the Public Prosecutor has called for all the papers in the official inquiries into the death and estate of Mr. John Albert Drinan, the 83-years-old London recluse, who was found dead in his lodgings at Nice on the 6th January last year.Mr. Drinan left the bulk of his fortune to the poor-boxes of the London police courts. His will was proved at.  76,000, but it is known that he was worth about  250,000, and efforts have been made to trace  100,000 said to have been deposited in an American bank.I did not actually pursue the enquiry as to whether or not this notice was repeated in the Paris edition of the Daily Mail, but it is quite obvious that if any of the conspirators had occasion to read it they became acquainted at a very early stage of the enquiry that some, at least, of their acts were regarded officially in this country as being of a criminal nature.Only one possible conclusion can be come to as to the manner in which the Daily Mail secured the information as to my private telephone conversation with the Public Trustee, and that is that the line had been tampered with at some part of it and that somebody had sold the information to the Daily Mail reporter. Close enquiry in my Department convinced me that the fault did not lie with any of the persons employed here.It is scarcely necessary to point out the grave damage which might be caused by a premature publication of such confidential matter, and the extraordinary lack of any decent spirit in the newspaper proprietors in not seeing that the public interest should have some weight as opposed to publications which have: a supposed &quot; news value.&quot; .--Rex v. Avis and Bushell.This was a prosecution for offences against the Coinage Offences Act, 1936, and the process of counterfeiting coins adopted by the prisoners was of such an unusual character that at the opening of the case the Common Serjeant requested the reporters present in Court not to disclose in the press the manner in which the coins had been made.One of the exhibits in the case was an album of four photographs, including three of the premises concerned and one of the implements used by the prisoners in the process of making the coins. Copies of these photographs were available for the use of Counsel, the Judge and the jury.The trial was concluded on the 9th July, 1937, and the prisoners were sentenced to 5 and 3 years&apos; penal servitude respectively. Although the following facts turned out not to be capable of strict proof, except for the subsequent publication in&apos; the Daily Express, a free-lance reporter of the Daily Empress, by name Joseph Leslie Wood, stole my file copy of the photographs from the table at the Central Criminal Court, and on Saturday, the 10th July, three of these photographs were published in the Daily Express, although one of the , three photographs had been cut so as not to exhibit some of the implements. A short article, with a portrait of Mrs. Avis, described the result of the trial and. made some remarks as to the illustrations.One of the elements in the ingenious process of coining was the provision of brass blanks which were punched from strips of brass and subsequently covered with the moulds and plated impressions of genuine coins. One of: the photo-graphs clearly showed the strips from which the blanks had been cut. :     -  .I submitted a case to Treasury Counsel with a view to prosecuting Wood for larceny and the Daily Express for breach of copyright, but I came to the conclusion that, if the charge of larceny could not be satisfactorily proved,- it&apos;was
scarcely worth while pursuing.a prosecution for breach of copyright, since by Section 11 of the Copyright Act, 1911, the maximum penalty which could be inflicted in connection with this particular prosecution was Only  50. Counsel advised me that the case against Wood, although affording grounds for grave suspicion, was not one in which he could recommend me to institute a prosecution.This case affords not only the most flagrant instance of the general disregard of the public interest, but also of a gross disregard of the public recommendation as to the case made by the Common Serjeant, which, as far as I am aware, was faithfully lespected by all the other newspapers who had occasion to publish reports of the actual trial..&apos; Rex v. James Williams.This case was referred to me by the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police on the 12th July, 1937. It involved an allegation that the defendant had been attempting to murder his wife by administering arsenic to her. On the 16th June, 1937, the wife, who had suspected these attempts at poisoning, succeeded in transferring the contents of a cup of coffee, which she suspected was poisoned, to a bottle and this coffee upon test was found to contain a considerable quantity of arsenic. There had been a prior history of sickness which indicated arsenical poisoning. Mrs. Williams consequently left her husband and by arrangement with the Police was treated at an address unknown to her husband.Police enquiries which followed the analysis of the coffee involved a confi-dential requisition being sent to the Police Divisions in the Metropolitan Area asking that special search should be made of the Poison Registers at Chemists&apos; shops throughout London. This requisition contained the name of the suspected husband and a description of him.It appears that there was a leakage of this confidential requisition which came to the knowledge of the Daily Mail, the News Chronicle, the Daily Herald, the Sunday Dispatch and the Daily Express. It was of the utmost importance that Williams should not suspect that active police enquiries were in train because it was desired to ascertain the source from which he obtained his supplies of arsenic. In fact, by an extremely good piece of police work, not material to the present issue, a man named Lee, who had been in the employment of some wholesale chemists, made a statement to the Police which, while implicating himself, made him a necessary witness for the prosecution as having supplied the arsenic to Williams.Williams was arrested on the 8th July, 1937.On the 2nd July, 1937, the Daily Mail reported an intensive search of poison registers at chemists&apos; shops throughout London for the purpose of^ tracing a purchase of strychnine by an elderly man. A similar publication was made on the same day by the News Chronicle.On the 3rd July, 1937, a similar publication was made by the Daily Herald.On the 4th July, 1937, the Sunday Dispatch published a report of a Police search of poison lists in an effort to trace a sale of weed-killer to a man answering-a particular description.On the 5th July, 1937, a reporter of the Daily Express, in total disregard of any police or public interest, interviewed the suspected husband, who explained that his wife had been ill for the past three months and that she had left him. He said that a few days before a man had come to his shop and told him that his wife had been poisoned, but that he could not understand the suggestion because his wife was perfectly fit when she went away and, although she had written to him twice since her departure, she never mentioned anything of the kind in her letters. After a few other irrelevant remarks, he furnished the reporter with a portrait of his wife.A report of this interview, with a photograph of the wife, appeared in the Daily Express of the 6th July, 1937, with the caption, in large letters, &quot; Husband tells of poison story about his wife.&quot;It was only to be expected that, after the arrest of Williams, a search of his premises for the purpose of finding arsenic, or some other poison, was entirely fruitless.This possibly is the worst example which has come to my notice of press publicity interfering with police investigation. Even if the details of. the requisition had come rightly to the notice of any persons connected with the
in )Vpress *and this in the present ease is open to grave doubt it would require the slightest degree of imagination on the part of an)&apos; pressman to realise that in an enquiry of this character publicity given to the identity of a suspect could only be gravely detrimental to police investigation into the case.The case affords a striking illustration of the point that where information has some &quot; news value &quot; of a sensational kind it is to be published in the most, complete disregard of the public interest.It was fortunate in the present case that, notwithstanding the press interference, it was possible to prove a conclusive charge against Williams, and he was sentenced on the 8th September, 1937, to 5 years&apos; penal servitude. On the other hand, action of a similar character in another case might well lead not only to the suppression of vital evidence, but also to the escape of a plainly guilty person.The Daily Herald Case, December 1, 1934.This case is not of a similar character to the foregoing illustrations, but it possesses some interest from the wider point of view of the publication of false news. In this issue of the Daily Herald on the front page there appeared a report of an interview between Mr. Ramsay MacDonald and Prince Paul of Yugoslavia. Sir Thomas Inskip, who was then Attorney-General, brought me this report and invited my opinion as to whether any proceedings could be taken upon it in view &apos;  of the following circumstances : It appeared that the report had had wide circulation by way of quotation in Eastern Europe. Not only were all the statements in the alleged interview completely false, but in fact no such interview had ever taken place. I was obliged to express an opinion to the Attorney-General that in view of the fact that none of the statements attributed to Mr. Ramsay MacDonald. could, be held to be libellous there was no law, as far as I could ascertain, which made it a. criminal offence to publish false news. I had in mind the possibility of instituting pro--ceedings for a, public mischief, but the Courts in recent decisions did not appear to have been favourable to any extension&apos;of the doctrine of public mischief which had been discussed before them, more particularly in connection with the useless expenditure of the time of the Police in investigating concocted stories of alleged crimes.   .In addition to the above, in the Daily Herald of the 24th February, 1937, details appeared with regard to a very confidential investigation which was being made as to charges of possible corruption in the City Police. The statement referred, to the examination of banking accounts, which had been allowed by the Banks under the strictest confidence, and can only have been obtained as a result of some improper disclosure in the first instance of some obviously highly confidential information. The Editor was interviewed and expressed his regret. \^ He stated who was the writer of the article, and the writer of the article, after benj^-remiiided of the provisions of Section 6, after some hesitation gave the name of the pc^soil from whom he had received the information. The person in question was not aNrei.ular member of the staff, nor was he one of the officials concerned in the investigation. He was a free lance journalist of some kind, and the writer of the artrcle1*3d not know his address and doubted whether we should be able to trace him.       ^^s.
