Printed for the Cabinet.. May 1938. - m   &apos;/   .-SECEET. ^ -Copy; No,CP. 112 (38). ^CABINET.CREDITS FOR TURKEY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.General.I HAVE recently discussed with the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister in charge of the Export Credits Guarantee Department (who also represented the Board of Trade) a question which has been causing me much anxiety, namely, that of assisting Turkey to buy warships to the value of about  6,000,000 in this country.. , 2. This question is closely connected with &quot;that of certain industrial credits which Turkey also wishes to obtain in this country and a Turkish Economic Mission has been in London for several weeks seeking to obtain, with the help of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, credits for at least  10,000,000 for industrial purposes.3. It is unfortunately apparent that the security which the Turkish Government can offer is inadequate to support credits extending to  16,000,000 in all, although opinions differ as to the extent of this inadequacy. I am, never* theless, convinced that for the reasons given in the following paragraphs they are essential on political grounds.The Political A sped.4. On account of her strategical position, Turkey&apos;s friendship or enmity is a vital factor for this country, above all, now that the implementation of the Balfour Declaration regarding Palestine may inevitably cost us the friendship of the Arab countries which flank our communications with India. The present Government of Turkey has deliberately chosen British friendship as the policy which best accords with their own international interests. But it is obvious that, if :His Majesty&apos;s Government wish this policy to continue, they cannot accept it passively, but must make every reasonable effort to reciprocate, the most important field in which it is open to them to reciprocate being to give Turkey the utmost possible economic assistance in her schemes of defence and industrial development.5. Furthermore, the position has recently been radically changed for the worse by the German absorption of Austria. Germany is now a direct neighbour of one of Turkey&apos;s associates in the Balkan Entente, Yugoslavia, while nothing but a friendly, or at any rate a docile, Hungary separates Germany from another of Turkey&apos;s associates, Roumania. As things stand at present, it is difficult to see what is going to stop the expansion of German influence over and through these two countries to the boundaries of an equally docile Bulgaria, and over and through Bulgaria to the boundaries of Turkey.6.   Beyond Turkey, again, lie the lands of the Middle East (Syria, Iraq* Palestine,. Saudi Arabia, Egypt) through which run our sea or air communication with. India.   The maintenance of our influence in those regions is not a simple matter at the best of times.  Palestine is, of course, making it much more difficult; 9866   [17193]
and I can say without hesitation that without a friendly Turkey it would become quite impossible. If Turkey fell, however reluctantly, within the German orbit-and the fact that Germany has been taking about 40 per cent, of Turkey&apos;s exports is a;formidable factor in the situation rGerman influence would spread freely through^the Middle East, encouraging our enemies in thqse regions and, above all, making good the lack of cohesion and organisation which is their principal weakness. ;;;%.). /^^i7. It is therefore scarcely too much to say that Turkey has become not the main, but the only, obstacle to the Drang nach Osten.8. This being so, it seems to me that the case for giving Turkey assistance is overwhelming, and in particular I endorse unhesitatingly the words of our Ambassador in Angora in a very confidential letter in which he recently said : &quot;It would seem dismally unfortunate if the financial difficulty stops their order (i.e., the Turkish warship order) being placed. Are we really debarred from using our tremendous money resources, one patent and tangible superiority that we possess over our European rivals, for helping our friends^ for creating employment at home, for building up in this instance a friendly navy in a region which represents for us a particularly high degree of political and strategical importance, for aiding Turkey to reach a military strength which virtually renders her immune from aggression, and strengthens her influence in the direction of peace and lawful behaviour throughout the Balkan Peninsula and eastwards to Iran and Afghanistan ? - . &quot; Cannot this problem be viewed from the point of view of finding a way-to surmount the difficulties ? We know all about these: but their mere restatement, however convincing, will get us nowhere. There is so much to gain by letting the Turks have British ships; there is so little to lose-a relatively inconsiderable sum of money, barely the cost of one day&apos;s war  and even that loss is by no means a certain one.&apos;&apos; My arguments apply as much to land and air as to sea armaments. But the sea armaments are now the most pressing, and, as between Turkey and ourselves, the most symbolic.&quot;9. Moreover, assuredly, if we do not help Turkey, Germany will, and an interesting example of what she is prepared to do in cases of this kind is afforded by her offer to Portugal for the supply of artillery..10. I cannot, of course, guarantee that the grant of these credits will infallibly attain our object of keeping Turkey indefinitely out of the German fold or even that the object will not be attained without them. It may even be that if the Turkish Government are given credits here they will also seek and obtain similar credits in Germany. In either case, if the point were put to the Turkish Government I expect that they would say that, much as they regretted the necessity of placing their armament orders elsewhere, it made and would make no difference whatever to their policy, which was, by cultivating the closest friendship with His Majesty&apos;s Government, to keep themselves, and as far as possible the other members of the Balkan Entente, outside the orbit of Germany or any other designing Power.11. But what I fear is that circumstances may be too strong for the Turkish Government or the Turkish people. No one can read the future, but, looking at the problem as one not on by of to-day, but of to-morrow, it seems to me inevitable that, however conscious the Turkish Government may be at this present time that their interests coincide with those of this country and however sincere their friendship for His Majesty&apos;s Government may be in consequence, the dominant position which Germany has now won in Central Europe, and which she is likely to improve and expand as the years go by, must suoner or later begin to affect, perhaps, unconsciously, the attitude and policy of the Turkish Republic. The present rulers of Turkey are not immortal, and if it seems to the Turkish; public as time passes that Germany is becoming more and more the Power of the. future, the effect of public opinion, however inert, cannot fail in the long run to. encourage the rise to positions of influence of those elements in the country which are. favourably disposed towards Germany,.or at any rate less resolutely determined than AtatUrk and his advisers to oppose her domination.
- .-.12. For this reason, and given the strategical and political importance of Turkey, I feel very strongly that no means must be neglected which&apos;may have1 the effect not only of strengthening the present Turkish Government in their attach-ment to a pro-British policy, in their resolution not to be tempted or forced into a position of dependence on Germany-or for that matter Italy or even the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics -and in their ability to follow with confidence the path they have chosen, but also of showing the Turkish people that there are material as well as moral advantages in the friendship of this country and of ensuring, so far as any action taken now can ensure the future, that Turkish policy will continue on its present lines whatever influences may make themselves felt.13. I do not rely unduly upon international gratitude, but I do feel that, taking into account the fact that Turkey will not owing to the necessity of spreading the armaments orders reap for some five years the full benefits of any credits she may now receive, a grant of substantial armaments credits, over and above substantial industrial credits, may have a powerful, and possibly a decisive, effect in keeping Turkish policy on its present lines for the next ten years. :,.14. My conclusion therefore is that Turkey ought to be given a credit of  6,000,000 for armaments purchases over and above her industrial credits of  10,000,000, subject to the conclusion of an agreement to improve the position of the Anglo-Turkish clearing on lines already under discussion with the Economic Mission. I naturally reaoh this conclusion with reluctance and hesitation. No Minister can lightly suggest at such a juncture in the national finances that His Majesty&apos;s Government should voluntarily incur a possible, though not a certain, loss of some millions of pounds, even though the loss would be spread over several years. But the times are exceptional and call, I am convinced, for exceptional measures.Legislation.15. No legislation is necessanr for the industrial credits, since these can be given without further Parliamentary sanction under the Export Guarantees Act, 1937. But if my colleagues agree with my conclusion a special Act of Parliament will be necessary for the warships credits, since the Export Guarantees Act does, not extend to &quot; munitions of war,&quot; and serious objection is seen in many quarters to any attempt to amend the Act by omitting this reservation.16. The form which has been proposed for such an Act is one which in its recital would refer to the conclusion of two Agreements with Turkey, one for industrial credits, which might already have entered into force, and one for warships credits, the text of which latter agreement would be attached as a schedule, and which would only enter into force after the Act had become law. This Agreement, after referring to the mining, &amp;c, programme of Turkey, would probably say that the United Kingdom would advance any sums, not exceeding  6 million in all, which might be payable by Turkey under any contract concluded with the approval of the United Kingdom for the purchase in the United Kingdom of warships and munitions of war, and then specify the terms of repayment. The terms of repayment should, it is suggested, be that repayment should begin after the industrial credits repayments had been effected, i.e., some-where about 1950, after which they would be repayable in a suitable number of annual instalments with interest at 5^ per cent. The operative part of the Act would briefly confirm the schedule and authorise the necessary payments out of the Consolidated Fund:17. So far as criticism on political grounds is concerned it should not, I feel, prove too difficult in the present temper of the House of Commons to secure the passage of a Bill designed to assist, even with arms, a State which has been a fervent supporter of the League of Nations and which is anxious to keep itself independent of the dictator Powers, although it would not be desirable for the Government spokesmen to stress the latter aspect of the question: There will also be criticism on financial grounds to be faced, and here the postponement of the payment of the first of the instalments due for the armaments credits until after the industrial credits had been repaid would make the defence of the proposals , easier. r;!l&apos;;-!:&apos;:i:cr:!i    &apos; :&quot;x&apos;&apos;l&apos;&apos;.n-. \       &quot;;&apos;-
18. It will&apos;not be possible to conceal the fact-that the grant of credits to Turkey has a political value. The position is also bound to be obvious to other Powers/including Germany and Italy. But although these Powers may draw their own conclusions, I think that so far as possible the commercial objects of the proposal should ,be stressed.Conclusion. - ,,&apos; 19. In view of the foregoing explanations, I ask my colleagues to agree that the necessary steps should be taken for the grant to Turkey of the credits indicated in this memorandum.Ff.Foreign Office, May 7, 1938.
