This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, May, 1938SECRETCopy No..,CP. 110 (38)THE cabinet war DEPARTMENT  PROPERTY  bill memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. Since I have been at the War Office I have found that a disproportionate-tionately large amount of the time of the Secretary of State is taken up in signing documents of various kinds which in other Government Departments are executed by permanent officials on behalf of the Minister or Board concerned. An examination of the classes of documents in question has shown that in some cases their personal execution by the Secretary of State has been a matter of custom rather than of legal necessity, and I have already made arrangements, with legal advice, to delegate some of this work. There remains, however, a large number of documents, mainly relating to the acquisition, management and disposal of property, the execution of which I am advised that I cannot delegate without legislation. The position of the Secretary of State for War, in this matter, must be now almost unique. In the case of the Admiralty there is statutory provision for the execution of deeds, etc., by any two of the Commissioners. In the case of the Ministers of Health, Labour and Transport, statutory provision is made for the adoption of an official seal, the affixing of which can be attested by the signature&apos; of certain officers of the Ministry, thus avoiding the necessity of personal execution by the Minister. The position of the Secretary of State for Air was practically the same as that of the Secretary of State for War prior to the Air Navigation Act, 1936, but the inclusion of Sub-section 4 of Section 26* in that Act removed the difficulty in his case.2. At the present time, when extensive purchases of land are being made by the War Office, the number of vesting deeds requiring signature is unusually large, and it is anomalous that the Secretary of State should have to sign all these personally just when the pressure of other more important business gives him less time than usual in which to do so. No War Department legislation is in sight which would provide an opportunity of dealing with this as a subsidiary matter. I accordingly ask my colleagues&apos; consent in principle to the introduction of a &quot; one clause &quot; Bill with the object of relieving the Secretary of State for War of the necessity of personally executing instruments to which he is expressed to be a party, to the same extent as Section 26 (4) of the Air Navigation Act, 1936, provides relief for the Secretary of State for Air.3. It has been suggested by Parliamentary Counsel that the opportunity should be taken to effect the desired result by amending the law as to the holding of property acquired for the War Department, which is not at present consistent* Section 26 (4) of the Air Navigation Act 1936, reads as follows : &quot; Any instrument in connection with the acquisition, management or disposal of any land or other property, being an instrument to which the Secretary of State for Air is expressed to be a party, shall be deemed to be validly executed by him if it is executed on his behalf by the Under Secretary of State for Air, the Secretary of the Air Ministry or any other person authorized in that behalf by the Secretary of State, and any such instrument purporting to have been executed as aforesaid on behalf of the Secretary of State for Air shall, until the contrary is proved, be deemed to have been so executed on his behalf.The method provided by this sub-section for the execution of such an instrument as aforesaid shall be in addition to any other method available by law for the execution of such an instrument on behalf of a Secretary of State, and this sub-section shall not be construed as affecting the validity of any method by which other instruments may be executed on behalf of a Secretary of State.&quot;
with the true constitutional doctrine as to the position of the Secretary of State. This, however, would involve a larger and more elaborate Bill creating a departmental corporation in which, instead of in the Secretary of State, War Department property would be vested,. Analogous provision would have to be made with regartl to Air Ministry property. It would be liable to be misconstrued at the present time and regarded with suspicion, with however little reason, as an endeavour to circumvent parliamentarjr criticism and control of the extended programme of compulsory acquisitions. I am not therefore in favour of it. I am anxious that, in order to render it non-contentious, the Bill should be kept as short as possible and should follow closely the corresponding provision in the Air Navigation Act which was passed without criticism.L. H.-B.The War Office, 6th May, 1938.&quot;(b38/8) 70 5/3s w.6.p. 1872
