-  118IIFIDENTIAL A.C. 408BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL STATE OF TRADE - FEBRUARY 1958    -Summary of the Reports submitted by Members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEA TRADE.      Imports in February at  75.7 m. were  4.0 m, more than in February 1937;.   over 70% of this increase was in food and raw -materials.    There was a total increase of  0.9 m. in manufactured goods.    Imports of iron and steel manufactures increased by  1.5 m. and of oils., fats and resins by  0.4 m,    Imports of non-forrous metals and manufactures declined by. 0.4 m.    Exports of United Kingdom products,  57.5 m were- 1.0 ku less and re-exports,  5.5 m. , were  1.4 m. less.EMPLOYMENT*- The estimated number of insured persons, aged 16 to 64 in employment (excluding agricultural workers) at 14th February was 11,324,000, which was 15,000 more than in January and about 20,000 more than in February, 1937.    There was in improvement in employment between January and February in building and public works contracting; in the clothing, boot and shoe, wool textile, pottery and furniture industries; in shipping service and in agriculture.    Employment declined in the cotton industry;  the silk and artificial silk industries;    tinplatc, metal goods and electrical apparatus manufacture;    motor vehicle and cycle industries;    general engineering, the distributive trades and.dock and harbour service.The total number of unemployed persons on the registers at 14th February - 1,810,421 - was 17,186 less than at17th January.Changes in the various divisions were:-London ..ooooo.0.0o. -3,497       N.Western ..... h-8,253S.Eastern .......... -4,394       North      ....... -2,982S.Western .......... -2,882       Scotland ....... -6,774Midlands .......0...

**&quot;   119BUILDING. Returns received from 142 Local Authorities show that the estimated cost of buildings for which plans were approved was  7.7 million - 26.8$ less than the figure for February 1937.    There were decreases of 69.4$ for factories, 11.0$ for dwelling houses and 33,1% for all other buildings or alterations of existing buildings.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.    In the four weeks ended 27th February Railway Traffic Receipts increased by  313,000  (2.75$) as compared with thecorresponding period of 1937.    The value of passenger traffic increased-       - -   - &apos;by 1.38%:   merchandise, minerals and livestock by 2.53% and coal,coke, etc. by 5.08%. These increases were partly due to increased charges which became operative on the 1st October last.SHIPPING.    There was no improvement during February.    Freights remained weak in most markets and at levels little above bare running costs.   Laid-up tonnage is increasing but owners in long distance trades 11were reluctant to lay up ships in the hope that demand would broaden.The Chamber of Shipping Index number of freights  (1935 ^ 100) was 129.5 as compared with 138.2 in January and 157.9 in February 1937.SHIPBUILDING. Steel makers in February made efforts to remove complaints of belated deliveries.    There were some signs that the present decline in new orders is merely temporary.   Naval construction, however, continues at a high level of .activity.BANKING.     Money continued to be plentiful during February.    Theallotments of Treasury Bills decreased and competition for them wasvery keen, the average rates varying between 10s.0.89d. to 10s.l.39d*The price of gold was steady between 139s.7d.  and 139s.l0-gd.    The15silver market was firm and the spot price fluctuated between 19jgd.and 20fd. with a premium of about ^ d. over the forward rate.    the dollar declined early in the month owing to fears of an inflationarypolicy, but strengthened later.    The disturbed international situationand fears of an internal political crisis unsettled the franc, whichfluctuated between 151^ and 154f.      The three months forward ratevaried from to 6f and the exchange required considerable support16from the authorities.
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD,Belgium. Money conditions remained easy.    The belga was steady between 89.50 and 29.62 and forwards remained at a slight discount *France. The effects of the world recession are being felt and unemployment has risen.    Rents weakened during February and the tendency in the share section was uncertain.Germany.    Exports fell short of imports &quot;In January by  3 nio owing principally to a steep fall (partly seasonal) in exioorts of manufactured goods.    It is difficult to assess Germany&apos;s capacity to withstand a recession in world trade, but it is significant that taxation now absorbs 28% of the total national income,,Holland.    The success of the conversion accelerated the decline in interest rates.    The guilder moved little from the pegged price of 8.96f.Italy.    The adverse balance of trade in 1937 (exclusive of trade with colonies) rose to  60 m.  (valued at average exchange rate for the year). Measures are being taken to curb-imports while the Government is proceeding with the programme of self-sufficiency.    In spite of controlled prices the rise in cost of imports has depressed, the standard of living. Exchange control maintained the lira at 19 to the U.8.A. dollar throughout 1937.Japan, Government Bonds were in good demand.    The stock market remained steady and commodity markets quiet,Switzerland, The migration of funds into Switzerland continued in January and February leading to a further vreduction in long-term interest rates.    The Swiss franc was steady between 21.58-g- and 21.63,U.S.A, The situation showed no pronounced change.    Steel production at 50% capacity was below consumption but buyers were limiting their purchases.   Retail prices generally are
declining.    The volume of stock exchange business was reduced by 4-0% compared with January.    The new capital market was 11% below January and 57% below a year ago.    The dollar&apos;fell to 5.03-g on February 16th but closed at about 5.02.  &quot;Forwards were, unchanged.GOAL.,   Production for the 13 weeks ended February 19th continued to show an increase as &quot;compared with a year ago. Unemployment in January was 11.3% as compared with 15.2% in January, 1937.    Exports of coal for February amounted to 2.61 m. tons, a slight increase over February, 1937.    Shipments increased to Italy, Spain and Germany while exports to France, Belgium and Denmark declined.ENGINEERING. There was a further slight decline in the volume of new civil business but current order books were so good that general activity was well maintained.     The decline in demand, together with increased output of iron and steel, has removed the difficulties of the supply position..    Exports of machinery in February amounted to  4.56 m. as compared with  3.46 m. in February 1937.    Imports were  137,000 more.MOTOR INDUSTRY. The number of motor vehicles newly registered in January (35,371) was 3,773 less than a year before.   The decrease in private cars was 3,962.    The production of private cars in December was 31,552 (8.1% less than in December 1935), and of commercial vehicles&apos;8,170 (19.6% less).    Exports of new private cars and chassis in February amounted to 7,329, an . increase of 19*4% compared with February 1937.    Experts of new commercial vehicles and chassis were 1,371, a decrease of 26.8% compared v/ith a year before.    Imports of new private cars were 1,81*2 compared with 1,427 in February 1937.NON-FERR0US METALS^ Metal markets remained fairly steady in spite of continued lack of interest by consumers in this country a Improvement in the copper position still awaits larger buying in the United States.
ELBCTRIGAL INDUSTRY. Reports for the year 1937 indicate a new high level in employment and in home demand.    Exports rose by 22fi, mainly to Empire countries, and imports&apos;by. lh$.    Reports for January showed that consumers tended to defer purchases of goods not urgently required.    Most sections of the industry remained fully employed with existing orders, hut if present conditions persist the position will be much less favourable in a few months time.    Electrical exports for February ( 1.7 million) were 29.1$ more than a year ago.    Electricity generated was 10.3^ more.IRON AND STEEL * Although markets were somewhat quieter than a few months ago, heavy tonnages were still going into consumption and a high level of output was maintained.    Pig iron output at 693*300 tons was 89,600 tons more than in February, 1937.      Owing to increasei&quot;! output and arrival of supplies from abroad, it is becoming possible to replenish stocks and reline furnaces.      Crude steel production at 1.057*600 tons was 61,700 more than a year before...- Adequate   &apos; supplies of serai-finished steel were available for all consumers.    Exports of iron and steel (157,000 tons) were hh.,000 tons less and imports (230,000 tons) were 11+8,000 tons more than in February, 1937.    It is hoped that recent meetings between the British cartel and U.3.A.  representatives will improve the export outlook.SCOTLAND. Works claimed to have enough orders on hand to occupy them until the third quarter- of 1938.    Shipbuilders continued to absorb large quantities of steel, but there was a lull in new orders for merchant shipbuilding.NORTH EAST COAST. Consumption of hematite remained heavy and stocks were still by no means large.    Heavy steel manufactures were overcoming arrears in delivery, but anticipate a fresh advance in orders shortly.      Local supply of semis was plentiful.
3HEFFIBLD- Arrears in pig iron delivery are now fully overtaken.   All steel works were busy and trade in stainless steels was fully maintained.SOUTH i&apos;&apos;/AL33. Large accumulations of orders enabled heavy steel manufacturers to maintain operations, though market conditions were quieter. - Sheet and tinplate manufacturers were obliged to restrict activity.COTTON. The decline in activity continued during February and was felt in all important overseas markets.    With a temporary recovery of cotton prices there was some improvement in the volume of new business booked, *but deliveries on account of old orders were still slow.    The daily yarn output index (1935=100) fell.from 102 in January to 97 in February, as compared with 111 In February 1937*    Yarn exports at 10.0 m. lbs, as compared with 10.8 m.  lbs in January and 12.6 m. lbs a year ago, were the lowest for 3^ years.      Exports of piece goods at 117 m.  square yards, compared with 138 m.  square yards in January and 160 me square yards in February 1937* were less than recorded in any month for many years.    The cocoa hold up in West Africa was partly responsible, exports to that market having fallen by 2m.  square yards since January.    The decline compared with January was spread over all important markets except Ceylon, British Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, U.S.A., Sweden and Norway, the largest relative deline being in British West Africa, Canada and Switzerland.W0QL. The slight improvement shown in general activity in . February as compared with the previous month was mainly in the preparatory departments of the worsted and woollen sections and did not extend to the weaving sections.    There is still a tendency not to place bulk orders..    There was a further substantial fall in raw wool prices.    Exports of tops, yarns and tissues declined in February compared with the previous month.HIDES AND LEATHER. Hide markets were rather erratic in February, and although at the close of the month values on some
classes had improved slightly, there was still lack of confidence in the future.    Business in most sections of the leather industry was difficult owing to continued uncertainty of raw material prices.CHEMICAL3. The volume of sales for most heavy chemicals continued to decline.    Deliveries of alkali were considerably less than in January,    Deliveries of chlorine products were slightly less but a little above those of February 1937.    The depressed condition of the textile industries continued to affect sales of dyestuffa.    Exports of fertilisers increased substantially, mainly to Japan and Empire markets.    Wood distillation products were in fair demand and business in pharmaceutical chemicals was steady,HOSIERY. The falling off of trade in some sections of the hosiery industry was severe.    In the underwear section conditions were worse than for many years.    The fine gauge full fashioned hose section is suffering from import competition.    Seamless fine gauge hose is still affected by the forward purchases made by consumers in anticipation of the price control scheme which was put into operation on the 1st January.RETAIL TR/JJB.    The money value . of retail sales in January was 6,2$ higher than in January 1937, &quot;s compared with an average rise of 7.7$ for the previous eleven months, February to December inclusive.    Sales of food and perishables&apos;increased in value by 8.2^ and of non-food merchandise by h.T$.    Preliminary returns for February indicate a much reduced increase in value of sales with perhaps an actual decline in Central London.CANADIAN TRAPS. The trend of economic conditions in January showed an improvement over- the preceding month.    High grade bond prices advanced and wholesale prices wore maintained.    The moderate improvement in speculative and financial factors, however, was partially offset by the decline in the index of physical volume of business to 112,0 in January.    Exports of
JL hi Ocopper exceeded those in any January in the post-war period, Exports of nickel, while greater than in any other January5 declined^compared with December, after seasonal adjustment. Zinc shipments increased and gold shipments were the highest for any January on record.    The manufacture of foodstuffs was of smaller volume than in the previous month, steel production rose slightly but pig iron output receded. Newsprint production and shipments of wood pulp fell considerably as compared with December.    New business in the construction industry was less than normal.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.    Bales of wool received into store during the seven months ended 31st January were 1,546,000 compared with 2,1+29,000 a year before, the quantities sold or shipped being 1,1+51,000 and 1,713,000 respectively. Wheat and flour shipments between 1st December and 21st February were equivalent to 30.8m. bushels as compared with 27,3 m.&apos; bushels in the previous year.      Butter exports from the 1st July to 26th February were 62,000 tons compared with -51,000 tons a year before..    Imports of merchandise in January amounted to  II.I4. m.  (Australian currency) compared with  9.5 m.  in January 1937.
