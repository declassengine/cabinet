THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S -GOVERNMENT.CAB I N ESECRETCP.91 (58).NATIONAL   REGISTER.COPY NOMemorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.     For some time past the question of creating a Voluntary National Register has been actively canvassed in various quarters and in various forms. The prevailing suggestion appears to be the issue of an appeal on a large scale to the nation at large, inviting men and women who wish to do so to enrol themselves for one or other of a specified list of public services.    It would, under this scheme, be left to the volunteer to indicate what   work he or she would undertake, though   presumably some proof of qualification would accompany the offer.2.     There are, in my view, a number of reasons why it is inadvisable to embark on such a scheme.    It would inevitably be so defective that the ultimat disappointment o:f hopes created by its establishment would outweigh any advantages which the scheme may be supposed to offer.Any voluntary register would necessarily be incomplete.in various vital particulars.    It would only cover a portion of the nation.    The result of such a partial enrolment, so far from impressing foreign opinion favourably, would probably have the opposite effect.Moreover, even if clear indications of the work to be done were given, it is certain that considerable numbers of people would volunteer for work . for which they were unsuited and without giving any clear indication why they regarded themselves as qualified for it.      The double result of this would be that a large number of volunteers would be disappointed and that, on the other hand, the value of the register for any practical purpose would be laxgely nullified.A^register which can actually be used for allocating men and women to appropriate work, must not only be compiled by highly skilled persons with a wide knowledge of industry, but must be kept continuously up to date.    A--  - -       ----- . -  ,     . .-&apos; &apos;.    -   ..- -  -      &apos;voluntary National register, compiled on the insufficient data afforded byvolunteers would, in addition to its other deficiencies, have no effectivevalue unless revised at three-monthly intervals.
What has been said refers only to a Voluntary, and therefore partial register. The question of the necessity of a complete National Register, compiled under compulsion and a carefully devised system for war purposes is a different one. Here the whole ground has been explored and plotted out by an expert Committee.It should be borne in mind, however, that even this Register, though of great value for food-rationing if that should become necessary, and perhaps for other purposes, could not be used for the day to day placing of individuals in employment.    This must necessarily be a matter for the Employment Exchange system with its detailed knowledge of individual capacities and its expert local staff.3.     In my opinion, therefore, a voluntary register of the kind apparently contemplated can serve no practicable purpose.    There is, however, some action of an analogous kind which has already been taken and other action which might with advantage be put in hand.So far as the fighting forces are concerned, the Service Departments are steadily increasing their establishments, and a noticeable improvement in the intake has shown itself during the last month or two.    I understand that particular care has been, and is being, taken so far as the Territorial Array is concerned, to see that discrimination is exercised in the selection of men for enrolment so that the output of munitions should not be prejudiced.    It may be noted at this point,that this is in anticipation of an elaborate and precise scheme which is in existence and would, on the outbreak of war, be applied to prevent the misuse and misdirection of man-power which proved so grave an embarrassment during the last war.    This scheme is designed to secure that there shall be a proper and reasoned distribution of men as between the forces and all. forms of industry vital to munitions and to the national existence during war.So far as Air Raid Precautions is concerned, enrolment is taking place actively and on a wide scale.    Here also preliminary discussions between the War Office, Home Office and my Department have taken place with the object that in the selection of men and women regard will be had to the competing claims of the Forces and munitions production.
i*i aIn the case of medical services, plans are I believe well advanced for the allocation and direction of doctors and nurses in consultation with the British Medical Association and the Nursing Associations.Finally, as regards munitions production, it must be remembered that with the exception of domestic workers, all industrial workers (including those employed in agriculture) are compulsorily insured.    This means that, through the Employment Exchanges, the Ministry of Labour are already in possession of much detailed information as to the distribution of labour. This information is acquired through the Unemployment Insurance Scheme and through the general work of the Employment Exchanges in meeting demands for labour.    It has recently been amplified.     An analysis has been made of all employees in each establishment separately in the shipbuilding, engineering and iron and steel trades, and in the metal trades generally.    This gives as at a recent date the numbers of workpeople classified according to their precise occupations.    It can thus be seen that the Ministry has in its possession knowledge of the distribution of each grade of labour employed in all branches of the munitions trade.4.     The arrangements I have outlined go a long way towards meeting our immediate needs.    There is, however, further action which I suggest we could usefully take at the present time.    I think we should take steps:-(l) to survey the field and see whether there are any other requirements for which volunteers should be enrolled now or, possibly, for which members of the public should be encouraged to prepare themselves; (2) to take the necessary action for obtaining enrolment and givingadvice in any such cases; and (3) to co-ordinate all these activities.The responsibility for suggesting fresh areas of enrolment and for taking executive action will, I presume, belong to whatever Department is primarily concerned in the particular form of activity.   For the purpose of co-ordination, and to some extent also of stimulation and advice it seems to me that it would be advisable to set up a Committee of Departmental representatives covering the Departments likely to be chiefly concerned.    If desired, I should be prepared to provide the Chairman for such a Committee from my Department.    This course may be desirable not only because of theSsmamuMB&apos;.....        &apos; 1Li&quot;ifiWmn
general interest which the Ministry of Labour has in the whole subject, but because the activities in question are closely related to those which may have to be performed in time of war by the proposed Ministry. of National Service, of which the Ministry of Labour is the parent Department.    The intimate knowledge which certain of my officers have of the plans made in that connection will enable them to avoid any unnecessary divergence from those plans in the arrangements which have to be made to meet the existing situation.(Intd.)
