THIS DOCUMENT IS TEE PROPERTY OP EES BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVmwmmJSCABINET. .   /iGRETo COPY NO. fL*\Tll6(38). &quot;&apos;UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE - WINTER ADJUSTMENTS.i PROPOSED NEW REGULATIONS.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OE LABOUR.1.     The Cahinet decided (Cabinet 21 (38)7) to assent to the withdrawal by the Unemployment Assistance Board of the additions to their allowances made last winter, and also to approve the suggestion by the Board that a new Regulation -should be made authorising them to make appropriate increases in allowances during the winter months in future years. 2.     I have now received the draft Regulation from the Board.      Its operative section is as follows:-&quot;Without prejudice to the generality of any power of adjustment conferred by the Principal Regulations, the amount at which the needs of an applicant for an allowance under the Act -would be assessed in accordance with these Regulations may, in a case where special needs -due to winter conditions exist, &quot;be increased to meet such needs by such amount as is reasonable in all the circumstances of the case&quot;. . 3.     I propose to approve the draft Regulation   which follows very closely the forecast which I gave to the Cabinet on 21st April (CP.97(38)).      It will need to be confirmed by Resolution of both Houses and I ask for authority to put down the necessary Resolution at the earliest convenient date.    . I should mention that the Debate in the House of Commons cannot, as I am advised, he confined to the change to be made by the Regulation but can range over practically the whole field bf the Unemployment Assistance Board&apos;s administration.(Int.) E.B.15th May, 1958.H.Q. 764-70, E.H.
