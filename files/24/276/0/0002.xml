;S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIT.;^NIC MAJESTY&apos;S QOVE.HNI.iBNT) ! G.R^E JT.75 (58)Q COPY-NO c   ^- &quot;CABINET.THE SITUATION, IN CENTRAL EUROPE.. CZECHOSLOVAKIA note &quot;by the Secretary of 3.tate. for Foreiffl jtf fairsoIn accordance with Cabinet 15(38)9 Conclusion 1, I circulate for consideration at tomorrow&apos;s meeting of the Cabinet the accompanying revised draft of the Statement to be made in Parliament(Intldo)       H,oreign Office, Se,Wol0 22nd March, 19380
His Majesty&apos;s Government have expressed the view that recent events in Austria have created a new situation and think it right to state the conclusions to which consideration of those events has led them0They have already placed on record their judgment upon the action taken by the German Government, and to that they have nothing to add0     The consequences of the action however remain 0     There has been a profound disturbance of international confidence0     In these circumstances the problem before Eu.rope, to which, in the   opinion of his Majesty1 s Government, it is their most tirgent duty to direct their attention? is how best to restore this shaken confidence and seek peaceful solutions to questions thatcontinue to cause anxiety0 ___...Of these the one necessarily most present to many minds is that concerning the relations between the government of Czechoslovakia and the German minority in that countryj    and it is probable^ that the solution of this question, if it could be achieved, would go far to re-establish a. more normal situation over an area wider than that immediately concernedoAccordingly, His majesty&apos;s Government have given special attention to this matter and, in particular, they have fully considered the question whether the United Kingdom, in addition&apos;to those obligations by which she is already bound by the Covenant of the League and the Treaty of Locarno, should, as a further contribution towards preserving peace in Europe, now undertake a new and specific commitment in relation to Czechoslovakia,,
It is right that I should here remind the He what our existing commitments are which might lead to the use of oxxr arms for purposes other than our own defence and the defence of territories of other parts of the British Cormrionwealth of Nations,, They are first of all the defence of France and Belgium against unprovoked aggression in accordance with our* existing obligations under the Treaty of Locarno as reaffirmed in the arrangement drawn up in London on 19th March, 1936,     His Majesty&apos;^ Government have also obligations by treaty to Portugal, Iraq and Egypt.     those  are our definite obligations in relation to particular countries.     There remains another case in which we may have to use our arms, . a case which is of a more general character but which may have no less significance.     This is the case arising under the Covenant of the League which was accurately defined by the former Foreign Secretary when he said:-&quot;In addition our armaments may be used in bringing help to a victim of aggression&quot; (and this might, of course, include Czechoslovakia) &quot;in   any case where, in our judgment, it would be proper under the provisions of the Covenant to do so.&quot;     The ex-Foreign Secretary went on to say:-   &quot;I use the word * may5 deliberately, since - in such an instance there is no automaticobligation   to take military action.     It is moreover right that this should be so for nations cannot be expected to incur automatic military obligations save for areas where their vital interests are concerned,&quot;
HoMa Government stand by these declarationss  and I 1 cannot but feel that the knowledge that any such actions which it may be within the power of Great Britain to take5 will be determined by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the da^ in accordance with principles laid down in the Covenants will not be without its influence upon the course and development, of any dispute.,  should such vr..&apos;aappily arise..The question now arises whether we should go furtherc      Should we forthwith, give an assurance to France thats  in the event of her being called upon by reason of German aggression on Czechoslovakia to imp 1emenb her obligations under the Franco-Czechoslovak Treaty9 we would immediately employ our full military force on her behalf.     0rs alternatively.,  should we at once declare our readiness to take military action in resistance to any forcible interference with the independence and integrity of Czechoslovakia.,  and invite any other nations;, which might so desire^ to associate themselves with us in such a declaration&apos;?    &apos; &apos; &quot;  -The first thing that emerges from a consideration of these two alternatives is that under either of them the decision as to whether or not this country/- should find itself involved in war would be automatically removed from the discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Government? and the suggested guarantee would apply irrespective of the circumstances which brought it into operation., and over which His Majesty&apos;s Gct/ermient might have been able to
exercise no control. - -This position is not one that His Majesty&apos;s Government could see their way to&apos;accepts  in relation to an area where their vital interests are not concerned in. the same degree as they are in the case of Prance and Belgium?    it is certainly not the position.that results from the Covenant;.;  and His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot conceal from themselves that to accept such a position would he likely to involve the risk of grave divergence of .opinion in this country and throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations at a time when it must he a primary purpose of any Government to maintain the greatest measure possible of national unity as well as -of unity within the Empire.^ (There is also another coasidsration which has /weighed with His Majesty1 s Governments  and which it is right to state with complete frankness..      It is not neeessa.ry for His Majesty&apos;s Government to emphasise how great is the importance that they attach to the maintenance of the most close and cordial relations with the French Government..     But they cannot doubt that anything would more unhappily affect these relations,  than if the people of Great Britain, had occasion to feel that their own participation in war was in fact,  owing to such guarantee,  dependent upon the prior decisions of the French Government*)
For these reasons His Majesty&apos;s Government feel   : themselves unable to give the prior guarantee suggested. But while plainly stating this decision I would add this, V/here peace and war are concerned,  legal obligations areinot alone involved,  and,  if war broke out,  it would be unlikely to be confined to those who have assumed such obligations.    It v/ould be quite impossible to say where it might not end and what Governments might not become involvedo    The inexorable pressure of facts, revealing threats to vital interests, might well prove more powerful than formal pronouncements, and it would be probable that a Government, though not party to the original dispute, would almost immediately be involved.    This is especially true in the case of two countries with long -associations of friendship like Great Britain and France, which are devoted to the same ideals of democratic liberty and are determined to uphold them0It remains for His Majesty&apos;s Government to state their attitude in regard to the proposal made by the Government of the U0S,S0Ro that an early conference should be held for the purpose of discussion with certain other Powers of the practical measures which in their opinion the circumstances demandB    His Majesty&apos;s Government would warmly welcome the assembly of any conference, at which it might be expected that all European nations would consent to be represented,  and at which it might therefore be found possible to discuss matters in regard to which anxiety
is at present felt.    In present circumstances however they are obliged to recognise that no such expectation can be entertained and the Soviet Government do not in fact appear to entertain it. This proposal would appear to involve less a con-sultation with a view to settlement than a concerting of action against an eventuality that has not yet arisen.    Its object would appear to be to negotiate such mutual undertakings in advance to resist . aggression,  as I have referred to, which for the reasons given His Majesty&apos;s Government for their part are unwilling to accept.    Apart from this, His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that the indirect, but none the less inevitable,  consequence of such action as is proposed by the Russian Government would be to aggravate the tendency towards the establishment of exclusive groups of nations, which must in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government be inimical to the prospects of European peace,--His Majesty&apos;s Government have repeatedly asserted the principles on which they consider the peace of the world depends and they do not believe that any stable order can be secured;, unless by one means or other general recognition can be won for what seems to His Majesty&apos;s Government to be the essential conditions of it.    The first is that differences between nations should be resolved by peaceful settlement and not be,methods of force.    The, second,  of no less importance, is that a. peaceful settlement, ,to be enduring, must be based on justice.
Holding diese views3 successive British Governments have accepted the full obligations of the Covenant of the League of Rations, and done their best to die charge- them; they have acceded to special instruments designed to pledge the nations afresh to refrain from resort to aggressive war;    and they have reinforced the general obligations thus undertaken by specific undertakings within, the frame-work of the League towards countries., with whom they enjoy special relations or in which they have special interestoOn the other side they have constantly lent., and are prepared to continue to lend, their influence to the revision of relations between nations, established by treaty or otherwise, which appeared to demand review0 They will continues., whether by way of action through the League or by direct diplomatic effort, to exert all their influence on the side of bringing to peaceful and orderly   . solutions&apos;any issues liable to interrupt friendly relations between nations,    ..So far as Czechoslovakia is concerned, His Majesty5s Government have been glad to take note of, and in no way underrate, the definite assurances given by the German Government in this regard^ and they will at all times be ready to render any help in their power,-by whatever means might seem most appropriate, towards the solution of questions likely to cause difficulty between the German and Czechoslovak GovernmentsuTo sum up. His majesty&apos;s Government accept theobligations which already rest.....upon them, and.have made and are making the maximum effort to place themselves in a position adequately to fulfil theme
^Acceleration of Rearmament^?.His Majesty&apos;s Government do not differ from those who feel that the increase of armaments alone is no sure guaranteedor peace.    They earnestly hope that it may yet he possible to arrive at a reasonable balance of armaments by agreement rather than by free and unlimited competition.They have on the other hand felt   it -right to make their view known that in the present state of the world, reliance upon the assertion of loyalty to the principles of the Covenant was not enough,  in the absence of practical strength by which those professions might be supported. Accordingly the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government recognises, and is based upon, the necessity both of working untiringly to strengthen the cau.se of peace, and also of taking all steps requisite to make this country strong enough to meet whatever call may be made upon it. In their view the knowledge in all parts of the world that such steps are being taken with determination and despatch . will be a valuable contribution  towards international reassurance.His Majesty&apos;s Government have sought to give to Parliament and to the world as full an indication as possible of their attitude upon the large matters and causes which are at present occupying the thoughts of all nations.      They.are fully sensible as I have said of the extent to which international confidence has been shaken and of the consequent apprehensions existing in many quarters.    They would,nhowever, deprecate the use of language here or elsewhere which can only have the effect of exacerbating the situation, and of exciting fears which
it is permissible to hope that the event will prove unfounded.    The only result would be the creation of an atmosphere in which the elements essential to wise judgment would be dangerously obscured.These conclusions have only been reached by His Majesty&apos;s Government after full and most careful review of all relevant facts and considerations, and with a keen sense of the great responsibility that rests upon them.     His Majesty&apos;s Government do not believe that any difference of opinion exists in any quarter as to the broad purposes of preservation of peace, and the association of peace with justice, to which the policy of this country should be directed, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have reached the clear conclusion that the course they have decided to pursue provides the best means by which this policy can be made effective.
