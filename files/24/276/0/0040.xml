(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY7 S GOVERNMENT), SECRET.CP, 115 (58)* * &apos;COPY NO.CABINET.SUPPLY OP WAR MATERIAL TO PORTUGAL. Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,As my colleagues are aware, the question of the supply of war material to Portugal has recently received a great deal of consideration.    A proposal was made that in return for a guarantee of her defence by H. M. Government, Portugal.would wait for the war material she wants.    This is now definitely unacceptable to Portugal,    Her requirements, so far as they are at present Known, are almost entirely guns, A Report has been made by the Chiefs of staff Sub-Committee as to the possibility of providing the types and number of artillery equipments required by Portugal,    xit the present moment, as I am informed by the Foreign Office, Germany is prepared to supply Portugal with all she wants and on favourable terms as to payment.    Dr. Salazar has, -however, undertaken to wait for a few days before deciding to accept the German offer in order that he may know whether H. M.  Government can supply the Portuguese requirements. The types, numbers and cost of guns required byPortugal are as followsr-- &amp; -&apos;$Jl .5*45&quot;: 204 4,000 each /   v,r$,,6&quot; howitzers 40 4,000    &quot;     jE^&apos;*&quot;60-pdrs. 48 6,000   &apos;**            5,7&quot; A.

A* guns (2 pdrs. ) butit is understood that the Portuguese do not now wish topurchase these equipments from this country, as these gunsn  are on a fixed mounting and the Portuguese desire a mobilev A
mounting which can he obtained from Messrs. Bofors in Sweden, Ammunition is also required for these and other guns.    There is no difficulty about supplying the ammunition,,    The whole trouble arises about the guns*It has been suggested that toicen deliveries might he made at a comparatively early date and that the rest of the requirements should he completed with due regard to the other commitments of Ho Mo Government and to our own requirementSo    At present priority in respect of some of the guns in question has heen assigned to Egypt, India and certain of the Dominionso    If Portuguese requirements are to he met before any deliveries are made to these Governments and if, as I understand to he the case, the Admiralty are prepared to defer their demand for a certain number of 3o7&quot; equipments, the following deliveries of 3o7&quot; guns will he possible.No delivery can be made up to the end of this present year, but on the above assumptions a token delivery f&quot;of 4 equipments might be released early in 19390    The li  &quot;balance of the Portuguese requirement of 36 could he met j  hy deliveries proceeding thereafter at the rate of 3 per I_month.    The War Office, however, are strongly of opinionj   that the existing policy of giving the air defences of GreatII   Britain priority over everything else, so far as 1939 atI  least is concerned, should stand, and that only a tokenI/j   delivery of 4 guns should he promised in 1939*    In 1940, on the other hand,  there should he no great difficulty in arranging for the completion of the total of 36cAs regards 3o45,f, there is no possibility of deliveries commencing &quot;before the end of 1939o    It will then he possible to offer a token delivery of,  say, 4 equipments*
As regards &quot;bulk deliveries, they could &quot;begin in June. 1940, at the rate of 12 a month, provided the A^TL-G^Tia^j gun-paao-geaHffae-wa-s postponed to enable, these deliveries to be made to Portugal.    The war Office do not like any such delay in respect of A* D. Go B. and take the view very strongly that the most that should be delivered is 4 per month from June 1940 to the end of the year and three times/vjUwXtkat amount in 1941. i^/^JwtV^u- I am informed by the Treasury that in order tolilHiidpostpone payment for these deliveries, if made, it will be necessary to pass legislation^With regard to 6&quot; howitzers and 60-pdrs., no forecast can yet be made as to when these are likely to be available.If it is decided to offer to provide Portugal with 3.7&quot; and 3.45u on the above conditions as to delivery with easy terms of payment,, it is possible that Portugal will agree to take her requirements from us instead of from Germany.(Infld) T.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ---!-!-----I-&apos; &quot;-;-&apos;-Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   May 1938.SECRET. Copy No. gD.P.R. 267.(Also Paper No. CCS. 717.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.SUPPLY OF WAR MATERIAL TO PORTUGAL. (Previous Paper No. D.P.R. 260.)Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.WE have had under consideration the question of the supply of armaments to Portugal in accordance with the request contained in Foreign Office letter No. W. 4782/75/36 of the 21st April, 1938, reproduced as an Annex to this report. It will be seen that the Foreign Office are anxious that a special effort should be made to meet the wishes of the Portuguese Government, and that they invite attention to Dr. Salazar&apos;s intimation* that the most urgent Portuguese require-ment is for certain types of arms for instructional purposes, and for the equipment of the covering troops on the frontier. They, therefore, suggest that a fresh effort should be made to ensure that at least some part of the artillery contract be placed in the United Kingdom, even at the cost of some delay in meeting our own requirements, and that steps should also be taken to allow the immediate supply of a certain quantity of arms for instructional purposes.2. It will be remembered, that, as recently as the 22nd March, 1938, the Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Armament Orders from Foreign Countries reportedt to the Committee of Imperial Defence that the commencement of delivery of the Portuguese Artillery order:): &quot; before 1940 could not be approved, without certainty of very grave damage to the Defence Programme, more especially in respect of (a) Admiralty gun requirements, (b) requirements for the rearmament of the field artillery.&quot; Nothing has happened since the, above recommendation was put forward to justify its reversal. It is an unalterable fact that the Portuguese demands cannot be met on any substantial scale without grave and from the military point of view, unjustifiable detriment of our own rearmament programmes.,3. It might perhaps be possible to keep Portugal within our orbit by supplying token equipments at as early a date as possible, with promises of more to follow. There are, however, certain considerations in connection with this suggestion which must be borne in mind. In the first place, it seems to us doubtful whether the Portuguese Government could be kept out of the arms of Germany by^merely token deliveries from this country, since Dr. Salazar talks of immediate deliveries of artillery equipment not only for instructional purposes, but also to arm their ^troupes de couverture. Secondly, we are informed by the Director-General of Munitions Production that token deliveries to Portugal could* See Enclosure 1 to Annex, paragraph 2.f Paper No. D.P.E, 260 and C.I.D. Minutes of 314th Meeting, Minute 5 t Paper No. D.P.R. 260, Appendix to Enclosure.[17152] b
not commence before 1939 at the earliest, and that even then they could be made only if His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to accept a rather slower rate of delivery not only to our own forces, but also to the Dominions and to certain foreign countries, some of whom have definite contracts in this matter. This is illustrated by the figures quoted in the paragraphs that follow.4. The types and numbers of Artillery equipments required by Portugal are  &apos;/3-45-inch 6-inch- howitzers60-pdrs.....3-7-inch A.A. . 40-m.m. A.A..204 40 48 36 36In addition to the above, Messrs. Vickers have been informed that the Portuguese Government are genuinely interested in and seriously contemplate the purchase of a number of 2-pdr. anti-tank equipments.5. Of the above equipments, only the 3-45-inch (25-pdr.), the 3-7-inch A.A. and the 2-pdr. anti-tank equipments can be considered for the purpose of token deliveries, since none of the other equipments are available.6. The following figures will convey an idea of the extent to which token deliveries of four of each of the above equipments to Portugal would slow down our own rearmament programme :  3-45-inch equipments :   One month&apos;s  delay-    (These  could not  be delivered earlier than the end of 1939.) 3 - 7-inch equipments : Two weeks&apos; delay. 2-pdr. anti-tank equipments : Four days&apos; delay.7. But, apart from the effect of token deliveries on our own programme, it must not be overlooked that the Dominions, India and Egypt also have require-ments of the particular equipments in question, and that their orders have been allotted the following priority :  Equipment.	Country.	Numbers.	Forecast made.-8-45-in. (25-	Egypt	56	Late 19.40.pdr.)	India	350	Commence end 1940 and			complete in 1942.	Canada	Unspecified 16	1940-41.3-7-in. A.A	Admiralty ....		2 in October 1939; 14, no			date.	Egypt	51	Deliveries may begin early 1940.	India	Unspecified	1940-41.	Canada	Unspecified	1941.2-pdr. A.T	Egypt       ....	86	14 in.1988-89,23 inl939-40,			59 late 1940.	Canada	34	4 in September 1938, 30 in 1940.	South Africa	4	1938-39.	Ireland	1	September 1938.	Australia  ....	Unspecified	1940-41.8. If the Committee of Imperial Defence think that token deliveries would satisfy the Portuguese Government, and that the political advantages to be derived from this expedient override not only the military risks involved in the slowing down of our own programme, but also the disadvantages of the disappointment which a further delay in the delivery of Avar requirements would arouse in the Dominions and Egypt, it would be for them to determine the precise quantities of equipment to be given, and the precise degree of priority to be accorded, to Portugal.9. There is another proposition which may be thought worthy of considera-tion. It is true that the Portuguese Government are insistent on having the most modern type of British equipment, but, if their armament position is as grave
as they make out, it seems possible that they might be prepared to accept some 18 pdr./25 pdr. converted artillery equipments. If so, a token issue of say 4 of these guns could probably be given somewhat before the end of 1939, and the delay on our own programme would not amount to more than a fortnight. We suggest that this proposition be put to the Portuguese Mission which&apos;is visiting this country in May for the purpose of witnessing trials of the 3-7-inch A.A. and 3-45-inch guns.10. In conclusion, we invite attention to Dr. Salazar&apos;s suggestion^ that British firms might be induced to accept delayed payment in respect of Portuguese armament orders. This is clearly a question on which we are not in a position to advise.(Signed)      CHATFIELD.C. L. N. NEW ALL. GORT.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.

ANNEX.Copy of a Letter dated April 21, 1938 (No. W 4782/75/36), from the Foreign Office to the Deputy Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence.MAY I refer to our official letters^ W 4594/75/36 and W 4782/75/36 of the 9th and the 21st April, covering copies of correspondence with our Ambassador at Lisbon about the proposed exchange of assurances with the Portuguese Government.You will see from our telegram No. 481 of the 20th April that, although we have asked Sir Walford Selby to try to persuade Dr. Salazar to reconsider his attitude towards the proposal, we have very little hope of this step proving successful. I do not need to repeat the reasons for which we feel that some special effort should be made to meet the Portuguese Governments wishes in questions of rearmament, for I know that the Committee of Imperial Defence share our view on the subject, and we much appreciated the expeditious and favourable consideration which they gave to the original proposal for an exchange of assurances. For these reasons we are reluctant to acquiesce in a situation which may have the serious consequences for Anglo-Portuguese relations of which we are all aware, -without one more effort to see if His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot, after all, satisfy the Portuguese wishes at any rate to some extent.* There is the further consideration that, if during the next few weeks the contract is definitely awarded to Germany, the position of our Mission in Portugal will be made extremely difficult, since such a development would be taken, with whatever justification, to be a sign of failure on their part.The most hopeful way in which the whole problem could, be freshly approached seems to us to lie in Dr. Salazar&apos;s intimation, reported in paragraph 2 of Sir Walford Selby&apos;s despatch No. 1091. of the 5th April, that the most urgent Portuguese requirement is for certain types of arms for instructional purposes and for the equipment of the covering troops on the frontier. We feel very strongly that HisMajest)^ Government should be prepared to make a fresh effort in order to ensure that some part of the artillery contract at any rate be placed in the United Kingdom, even at the cost of some delay in meeting their own requirements, and we would, therefore, urge that, if possible, steps should be taken to allow the immediate supply of at least a certain quantity of arms for instructional purposes. This might well mean that only a relatively small consign-ment of arms need be furnished now, but that the eventual orders would cover a large range at a time when the United Kingdom arms industry is in a better position to supply them. We also feel that Dr. Salazar&apos;s suggestion, recorded in paragraph 4 of Sir Walford Selby&apos;s despatch under reference, about facilities for delayed payment in respect of Portuguese arms orders, deserves the most serious examination.I should be very grateful if you would have these suggestions urgently considered, and let us know the views of the Chiefs of Staff on the subject as soon as possible.I am sending copies of this letter to Troup, Pownall and Boyle, and to the Ambassador at Lisbon.(Signed) GEORGE MOUNSEY.* Not. reproduced, f Enclosure No. 2.

Enclosure No. 1 to Annex.Copy of a Despatch No. 109, dated April 5, 1938, from His Majesty&apos;&apos;s ambassador at Lisbon to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. My Lord, *- &apos;WITH reference tq my despatch No. 101 of the 31st- March last and my telegram No. 45 of the 30th March, I have the honour to inform Your Lordship that Dr. Salazar received me this afternoon in order to give me his reply to the suggestion for the exchange of notes between the two Governments concerning armaments and defence.2. It was obvious that he had considered the problem very deeply as he was furnished with voluminous memoranda. He opened the conversation by saying that he attached the greatest importance to removing any possibility of mi sunder-standing between the two Governments, and this was the reason why he proposed to cover a somewhat wide field in his explanations. He said that, in the first place, he would explain to me the position as regards Portuguese armaments; The old material in the possession of the Portuguese Army was perfectly useless, and some of the material for which tenders had now been asked was for instructional purposes, and to arm the &quot;troupes de couverture&quot; upon the frontiers in the event of any sudden land attack on Portugal. The possession of such material was absolutely vital for Portugal, even if war was distant. He wished to arm four divisions. Naturally he would like to obtain his material from Britain, since in the event of a war it would probably be to that source that he would have-to turn for supplementing his reserves of arms and ammunition after mobilisation, especially in certain categories of arms, where he admitted British superiority over- that of foreign manufacture. From this point of view he was anxious for British armaments and ammunition. He thought that in the policy which he had pursued since he had come into office he had shown his anxiety to make purchases in England, and instanced the purchase of warships in 1930 and 1932, even though the price asked by other countries was very much lower than that demanded by British firms. He had recently bought aeroplanes from England, but they were unquestionably dearer than those which he could have purchased in other quarters. At the moment, &quot; a third Power &quot;-I took it Dr. Salazar was referring to Germany had offered him material to arm a whole division, but he had up to the present refused this offer on the ground that he wished to maintain uniformity in the rearming of the Portuguese forces, and did not wish to accept an offer which might involve a departure from this principle. The foregoing was evidence of his attitude towards acquiring armaments in England.3. Dr. Salazar reminded me that it was he alone who had embarked on the policy of acquiring armaments in England, since up to the outbreak of the Great War, Portugal had, for the most part, acquired her armaments elsewhere; up to 1900 in Germany and Austria, and from then on in France and Germany. When the war broke out, the Portuguese Army was for the most part armed with French and German material. At this point Dr. Salazar again emphasised the need of urgency for the armament of the Portuguese forces for instructional purposes, and. said that if, of late, he had been compelled to change his course of purchasing armaments in England, it was simply because he could not afford any longer delay, especially in view of the developments in Spain.4. There were, however, other reasons why some purchases had been made in countries other than England. For certain categories of armaments British material was unquestionably the best, but in other categories it was out-classed by material provided by other countries. In some respects British armaments did not always best respond to the needs of Portugal. Dr. Salazar mentioned mountain artillery and said that for mountain artillery the Italians were ahead of us. Then there was the question of price. British armaments were very expensive. In the case of the Breda aeroplanes recently purchased from Italy (see Mr. Bateman&apos;s telegram No. 195 of the 25th November last), the price was exactly one-third less than that offered by the British manufacturers. The question of payments also came into the picture. England followed her classic practice of cash payments and had not as yet adopted the compensation system, as, for instance, Germany had. He added that he was at the moment negotiating
a compensation with Italy and mentioned, in connection with the purchase of the Breda aeroplanes, that the Italians had agreed to leave part of the purchase price available in a bank in Portugal for the purchase of Portuguese goods. Moreover, I must remember that Italy and Germany were both debtors to Portugal and he*must contrive to see that the debt was liquidated in one manner or another. At the present moment there was a large amount of German Marks standing to the credit of Portugal in Berlin, and he must obtain the equivalent of his money somehow. At this point Dr. Salazar asked whether British firms interested in these armament contracts could not be induced to accept delayed payment, thus placing British facilities on the same basis as those which Germany and Italy were ready to provide.5. Dr. Salazar went on to refer to the export permit difficulties which he had encountered in England last year. He said that he did not wish to stress the point, as these difficulties had now been overcome, but in the case of Italian and German arms contracts they did not arise, nor had they ever arisen. He mentioned an experience that he had had at the hands of the French. He had ordered some mortars in France and at the last moment, when delivery was due, the French export permit had been refused. The same had occurred, as I might remember, recently in the case of Czechoslovakia, He could not afford, in the position in which he found himself placed as regards Portuguese armaments, to run any risk, if an order had been placed, of an export permit being refused at the last moment. He said he had only mentioned this, for it referred to the past, as there were no difficulties with England at the present moment.6. &quot;Coming to the question of the proposed notes, Dr. Salazar said that he hoped the many reasons which he had given me and which he was most anxious I should bring to the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government, would explain why the guarantee proposed in the notes would not cover the question or urgency which he had emphasised.   It was his sincere intention to do everything possible to obtain such armaments, as he might require as near like the British as possible, but he could not commit himself to make a definite promise to purchase all arma-ments in England with no certainty that he would be able to provide himself with what was absolutely essential for preparing for the defence of Portugal in the event of some unforeseen and sudden contingency arising.  At this point, as I had done with Dr. Sampayo, I reverted to the manner in which the notes had emerged and impressed upon him that it arose out of views expressed by General Miranda Cabral to the members of our Military Mission.   Dr. Salazar said he regretted very  much  if  there  was  any  misunderstanding   due   to  anything  which General Miranda Cabral might have said, as General Miranda Cabral was certainly not authorised to speak on his behalf, for the fundamental reason that his terms of reference confined him to exploratory conversations.     The Mission had no competence to touch upon matters which entered into the political field.     Dr.   Salazar   went  on   to   say   that  he  wished  to  express   his most sincere thanks to His Majesty&apos;s Government for the manner in which they had come forward in the matter of the guarantee and appreciated all the importance of what they were prepared to do.  At the same&apos;time no guarantee by His Majesty&apos;s Government at the present moment could overcome the difficulty with which he was confronted.   Moreover, he felt compelled to ask himself the question whether the new guarantee might not prove a source of ambiguity.   The Anglo-Portuguese Alliance was a defensive one, and hitherto, even within its terms, each Government retained a certain liberty of action as regards decisions in the matter of the casus fcederis.   He presumed that the new guarantee meant that during the period of the arms deliveries His Majesty&apos;s Government were ready to waive this right.   In any case, he felt that further study of this aspect of the matter was required.  He emphasised all the importance which he attached tb throwing no doubt whatsoever on the existing commitments between the two countries, and he rather apprehended that any fresh pronouncement might have this effect.  However, that issue could be postponed for the moment since no fresh guarantee of any kind could overcome the difficulty which he had explained to me as regards the necessity of the immediate rearmament of certain Portuguese divisions.7. I thanked Dr. Salazar for his long and obviously very carefully prepared answer to the proposals of His Majesty.&apos;s Government, and said that I would not fail to report to them what he had said.   I presumed that I might take it that.
for the time being, he was not prepared to enter into the proposed exchange of notes. Dr. Salazar said that that was so, but at the same time he begged me to give his full reasons to His Majesty&apos;s Government, as the last thing in the world which he wished was any misunderstanding between the two Governments.8. In conclusion Ftoid Dr. Salazar that I understood that no final decision had been taken as regards the artillery and other contracts which the Portuguese Government were proposing to place. Indeed, I had learned from Vickers&apos; agent that he had been informed by the Under-Secretary of State for War that it was the intention of the Portuguese Government to send a new mission to England to test the British material. Dr. Salazar said that that was the case, but he here referred to the long delays which had occurred in the tendering of Vickers&apos; contract. Within three weeks he had received from Krupps and the Swedish works of Bofors a definite offer to provide the material required by the Portuguese Government, Bofors having undertaken to execute the contract if His Majesty&apos;s Government could be induced to agree to the postponement of certain orders which His Majesty&apos;s Government had placed with that firm. So far as Vickers were concerned, he was still awaiting their final tender and had not, up to the present, been able to obtain it. I told Dr. Salazar that on this aspect of the question I was compelled to make an observation. He must realise that the condition he had attached to the Vickers contract was that the material to be supplied by that firm was to be of the latest design adopted in the British Army. He would appreciate that something was involved in the matter of the divulgation of secrets. I knew that we were at all times ready to place the utmost confidence in our Portuguese ally, but military secrets were of such a character that even among our own people the utmost circumspection had to be exercised. ,^Dr. Salazar said that he perfectly appreciated that point and did not wish to ask His Majesty&apos;s Government for anything unreasonable. He did not want their secrets, but in placing orders for artillery and other arms he must have some idea as to performance, and it was that for which he asked.9. I perceived that no purpose would be served in pursuing the argument further with Dr. Salazar at that moment, and said that I would retire to consider what he had told me. He said that, if there were any points on which I required further elucidation, I had only to refer to Dr. Sampayo, who was fully empowered to give me all the information which I might require. In conclusion, I again thanked Dr. Salazar for his very lengthy and careful exposition^ while he again begged me to place his reasons faithfully before His Majesty&apos;s Goverh-ment, as the last thing that he wished was any misunderstanding between himself and London.10. In the meantime, the Military Mission is absent on a tour in the north of Portugal and Admiral Wodehouse does not return to Lisbon until Thursday week. At one point in our conversation I indicated to Dr. Salazar it might be well to consult the Mission, but Dr. Salazar seemed to think there was no urgency on this particular point. He said be would speak to General Miranda Cabral on his return to ascertain what he had said. I will also not fail to explain the developments to Admiral Wodehouse.11. To this conversation with Dr. Salazar I have little to add in the way of comment, except that I was impressed with bis anxious desire to furnish^His Majesty&apos;s Government with the fullest explanations in regard to his attitude towards the arms contracts, and I feel that these explanations are deserving of the closest attention. It is, of course, most unfortunate that any misunderstanding should have arisen due to General Miranda Cabral having exceeded his authority, but little harm has, in my opinion, been done, since in the first place it has given me a renewed opportunity of impressing on Dr. Salazar&apos;all the importance His Majesty&apos;sv Government attach to the Portuguese Alliance, and, arising out of that association, our deep interest in the allocation of the arms contracts; and in the second place, Dr. Salazar has provided us with a full expose of his own point of view as. regards Portuguese rearmament.12. In conclusion I desire to draw particular attention to Dr. Salazar&apos;s reference to the question of payments, since much is involved in the direction in which these arms contracts are eventually allocated from the point of view of the undermining of our position in this country. Numerous are the observers who consider that undermining, particularly by Germany, has gone quite far enough,
and that the time has come to arrest it, even to the extent of calling upon our formidable financial resources for assistance to counter the expedients resorted to by our competitors in the furtherance of their trade and the spread of their propaganda. It is impossible to overlook the fact that a section of Portuguese opinion, especially among the youth of the country, is deeply impressed with the seeming success of the policy of the Dictatorships as opposed to that of the western democracies, and, this being so, there would seem to be every reason why we should endeavour to prevent any further incursion of influences potentially hostile to us through the channel of Portuguese rearmament, with all that must entail in the extension of influence in the Portuguese Army and in other Portuguese circles.I have, &amp;c. (Signed) W SELBY.Enclosure No. 2 to Annex.Copy of a telegram from the Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Lisbon,No. 48, dated April 20, 1938.Your despatch No. 109* and your telegrams Nos. 46 and 47 [of the 5th and 6th April : Proposed exchange of assurances regarding Portuguese rearmament].There need be no fear of any misunderstanding regarding Dr. Salazar&apos;s reception of this proposal, originating as it did from conversations between the Mission- and their Portuguese colleagues, and not from His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment, who, on the contrary, appreciate the sincere and straightforward way in which Dr. Salazar has explained his position.In the circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not wish to insist on their proposal. After careful consideration, however, they are not fully convinced of the soundness of Dr. Salazar&apos;s case. He fears an immediate attack on Portugal, but by whom? PortugaFs only land neighbour, Spain, is in no position to attack anyone, either now or in the near future. Even assuming that she were in such a position, surely the proposed exchange of assurances would be the most effective deterrent. Entirely apart from the progress made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in their programme of military rearmament, the Royal Navy is in good condition and no Spanish Government is likely to wish to. be exposed to-the damage which could be done by the exercise of British control at sea.Please approach Dr. Salazar again on these lines and endeavour to induce him to reconsider his decision.Eor your information, I appreciate that this step is not likely to be successful. But I am reluctant to drop without further discussion the proposed exchange of assurances, which seems to me to be our best hope of keeping any foothold, as against foreign competition in Portugal, in the matter of Portuguese rearmament.If, however, you are satisfied, as a result of further conversation with Dr. Salazar that there is no prospect of persuading him to reconsider his decision, you may inform him that his proposals regarding the artillery tender are receiving renewed and urgent consideration. You should express the hope that no decision will be taken to place the contract elsewhere until His Majesty&apos;s Government have had time to come to further conclusions which will be communicated to you with least possible delay.Enclosure No. 1 to Annex.
