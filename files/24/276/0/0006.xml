(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJES TY&apos; S GOVERNMENT ) .COPY No38-SECRET.CP. No,  79/38.CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the. Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 20th March, 1938.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated the 20th March, 1938,issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1*      &quot;Ppliticjal&quot; prisoners and a crisis.    The last appreciation narrated events which led the Congress Ministries of United Provinces and Bihar to tender their resignations because they were not permitted to order the immediate and indiscriminate release of the  &quot;political prisoners remaining in jail in those provinces.      For some days the result of this action was in doubt, and in particular the possibility of all Congress ministries being required to resign in sympathy was canvassed with interest throughout the country.      The ministers of the two provinces went off to Earipura (a village in the province of Bombay), where the all-India Congress Committee was to hold its Session.      The Session ended on 21st February.    &apos; On &quot;the 22nd the Governor-General issued a firm but conciliatory statement.      The ministers, on return to their two provinces, resumed work and the crisis was over1..From the somewhat tangled background to these events,  it seems possible to draw the conclusions that Congress Working Committee had never- intended the ministries to press the issue as far as resignation,  and, certainly did not intend the other Congress ministries to resign in sympathy, but welcomed a situation through*&apos;which,  on the eve of a session where the left wing contemplated a strong attack on the moderate policy of the Working Committee, they were enabled to evade that attack and claim credit for a resolute stand on behalf of the -prisoners and against the interference of the Governors&apos; and the Governor-General in the ministerial
field.      As a result,- the left- wing was silenced at Haripura, and now probably suspects that it has been o ut-raano e uvr e d.As regards the prisoners, the Governors undertook to consider their early release after individual examination;    and in fact they hare agreed to release 22 out of 23 &quot;political&quot; prisoners in Bihar, and II out of 14 in the United Provinces.      Many of the released prisoners have made statements abjuring violence, and the releases have so far had no bad result In other Provinces, the policy of examination of individual cases&apos; has proceeded,  and a number of prisoners have been released.      The hunger strike in the Punjab jails was abandoned on February 26th,  on the persuasion of local Congress leaders.A crisis, which for a few days seemed to have dangerous possibilities, has in fact had salutary effect the good relations of /the two revolting Ministries with their Governors have not been impaired.      While the impression has been dispelled that the administration of the Ministers is liable to wanton or capricious -interference,  it has been made clear that any attempt to thwart the safeguards in the constitution will be checked.In future the resignation &quot;bluff&quot; will not be lightly attempted - especially as on this occasion sous other Congress ministries let it be clearly understood that they did not prorjose to come out in sympathy.      The Congress right wing has gained ground at the expense of the extremists.      The Moslems are.said to have been encouraged by an assertion of authority, and gratified that Congress intransigence has not gone unopposed.2*      The Congress Party.    The&quot;crisis describedv
3.above overshadowed all other subjects at the All-India&apos; Congress session at Haripurn.      The Working Committee met on February 14th to prepare resolutions for the open session, which was held from February 19th to 21st. From the spectacular point&apos; of view the session was a successi    some 120,000 persons are estimated to have attended.      But the expenditure of rupees 7^- lakhs on a vast camp equipped with modern conveniences scarcely fulfilled the idea of a conference in simple village surroundings, and has been criticised by Gandhi.Subhas Bose, the new Congress President, is said not to have made a favourable impressionj    he is regarded as unstable and of mediocre talent and personality, but he appears unlikely to be dangerous, which one might expect from his past record of subversive activities.      His presidential speech combined prolixity with a poor deliveryj    it was an exposition-.of his own ideas rather than Congress policy, and can hardly have been appreciated by the predominantly moderate Working Committee.      The official resolutions . had an easy passage and all but one were adopted without amendment.      Congress repeated their opposition.to war and their refusal to allow the resources of India to be exploited by British imperialism in support of Fascist powers.      The federal scheme, was once more condemned, but in terms which leave the door open for further, negotiations. Prompted no doubt by opprehension at the continued antagonism of the Moslem League,  a resolution again assured minorities of Congress sympathy and protection.The right wing attitude towards violent agitation produced a resolution whTeh stated that Congress,while sympathising with the Kisans  (peasants),  cannot&apos;.
countenance any activities, which are opposed to Congress principles, thereby endorsing a decision of the V/orking,* Committee announced in January.    The extremists are said to have pressed for more forcible action in the Indian States, but the resolution on this subject asserted that, though it is the policy of Congress to work for the attainment of full responsible government in the States, they are not in a position to do so &quot;effectively in existing circumstances:    for the present, Congress Committees in States are to be under the control of the Working Committee and are not to engage in &quot;parliamentary activity&quot; or &quot;direct action&quot;.    A long-winded resolution on the ministerial resignations authorised the &quot;Working Committee to take such action as is considered necessary.    In general,  it may be said that the Session took its tone from the moderate elements and strongly reinforced the authority of the Working Committee3.      The Central Legislature.    The central budget &quot; -.. was presented in the Assembly on February 20th.    It has been possible to provide the cost of introduction of provincial autonomy and the separation of Burma as well as the expenditure on the W&amp;ziristan operations and at the same time to show balanced budgets both for 1937/38 and for 1938/39, without imposing any new taxation.    A small surplus of 9 lakhs is estimated for 1938/39.    The presentation of the budget led to an unfortunate demonstration, which contrasted with the dullness of the earlier stages of the session, when many Congress members were away at Haripura.    A perusal of the budget papers revealed to members a departure from previous practice in
that a demand for payment of civilian clerks in the Defence Department was excluded from the vote of the Assembly.To mark their displeasure at what they represented as a wanton withdrawal of a former privilege, all organised parties in the Assembly, with the exception of the elected European group, combined in refusing to take any part in the general discussion or in the discussion of demands for grants or of the Finance Bill: and announced that they would vote against all demands for&quot;grants and against the Finance Bill at its second reading.    The parties combining in this line of action commanded between them an assured majority, and their programme was duly put into execution.    The wholesale rejection of all demands for grants forced the Governor-General in Council to exercise his statutory power to &quot;restore&quot; grants rejected by the Assembly, and the rejection of the Finance Bill forced him to resort to his special powers to secure the enactment of the Bill.    In the Council of State, which does not vote demands for grants and was therefore not directly affected, the only two organised parties associated themselves with,the grievance voiced in the Assembly and combined in a &quot;walk out&quot; during the general discussion of the budget.The legal background of the change in practice which evolved these developments may be shortly stated. The provisions of the old Constitution Act, which the new Act continues in force during the transitional period pending the establishment of Federation require the proposals of the Governor-General in Council for
3-7V    : ;      6.   :.appropriation of revenue to &quot;be submitted to vote of the Assembly in the form of demands for grants save in the case of proposals relating to certain specified heads of non-voted &quot;expenditure, one of which is &quot;expenditure classified by order of Governor General in Council as defence&quot;.    In previous years the expenditure involved in the demand for the pay of civilian clerks in the Defence Department was not classified as &quot;Defence&quot; and consequently did not enter the non-voted field.This year, upon a-review of the classifications of expenditure consequential on the commencement of the Government of India Act 1935,  the Governor General in Council was led to the conclusion that he was constitutionally bound to make an order classifying the relevant expenditure as &quot;defence&quot; - particularly in view of a provision in the Act which requires charges for civilian personnel to be treated in the same manner as charges for military personnel.    The expenditure therefore entered the non-voted field.    Apart from the constitutional aspect,  it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the grievance of which so much was made was purely artificial. It was open to the opposition to censure the defence policy of the government&apos;by moving a cut on the votable demand relating to the Executive Council.    It is permissible to conjecture that the opposition parties were eager to grasp an opportunity to create an atmosphere of excitement in the Central Legislature in the hope of refuting the general impression that with the shifting of political interest to the provinces, the Central Legislature affords no scope for any vital form of. political, activity.
4.      Provincial Legislatures.      Of the budgetstatements which have been presented in all the provincial Assemblies,, five show an estimated surplus and six a deficit.      The deficits are small, except in Bombay, where it is estimated at 40 lakhs of rupees.      The budgets are, on the whole, not spectacular and reflect a sound financial policy.     No further suggestions have been made for drastic methods of retrenchment such as attacks on the salaries of the services.      New taxation is to be imposed in two provinces only, Bihar and the Central Provinces.      Madras and the United Provinces have announced their intention of further borrowing in the open market toward capital expenditure for national development. The Central Provinces Assembly has jjassed the Prohibition Bill and a similar bill has been introduced in Bihar.The I\Torth West Frontier Province Assembly has distinguished itself by passing   a private Bill to repeal &quot;repressive&quot; laws, including the law punishing sedition. The (Congress) Prime Minister acquiesced in its enactment, though he has admitted in private that he does not wish it to become law and depends on&apos;the Governor to withhold his-- assent,5.      Communal troubles.      The simultaneous observance of the great Muhammadan Festival of Muharram and the equally important Hindu Festival of Holi has led to serious communal tension in many districts, chiefly in the Punjab and the. United Provinces.      Absolutely necessary precautions, including- the promulgation of restrictive orders and.the drafting of additional police, had to be taken in,a number of important centres.      In Allahabad
tension was so acute that troops patrolled the City. These measures,  together with official appeals and negotiations among the two major communities, prevented any very serious trouble at the time, but there have/ since been outbreaks in various places, including Allahabad, which have caused loss of life, and at the moment the tension between the communities is generally critical.The long pending dispute between Sikhs and Moslems over possession of the Shahidganj mosque in Lahore has grave possibilities of disorder;    the dispute lay dormant while the case was under litigation:    but the finding of the High Court (by a majority) in favour of the Sikhs has led to. attempts in the Punjab Assembly to upset the decision by legislation:    and it is still uncertain whether violence and a severe blow to the stability of the ministry can be averted.6.      Economic situation.    Apart from, the continuance of scarcity conditions in certain parts of Southern India, the economic situation is generally satisfactory and prospects for the coming harvest are good.    A cyclone which visited part, of Assam on March 7th was responsible for some 60 deaths, a number of injuries, and serious, damage to property.An explosion on 13th March in a colliery in Hyderabad State caused the death of 47 persons, including the European general manager.7.      Waziristan..    The situation in Waziristan is not yet stable.    The Madda Khel failed to comply with orders to expel the faqir of Ipi or accept responsibility for
9.his behaviour and punitive action has in consequence*r:&apos; &apos; &apos;been taken against them.    The effect of this action is not. yet known.    The Fa air of Ipi is at present believed to be in a remote valley on the edge of Madda Khel country and close to the Afghan border.    Elsewhere in Waziristan there have only been a few minor incidents.
