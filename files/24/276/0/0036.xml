Roland de Margerie (French Embassy).FIRST MEETING, APRIL 28, 10-30 a.m. Preliminary.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN opened the proceedings by saying how delighted he and Lord Halifax were to meet M. Daladier and M. Bonnet, the latter of whom was an old friend. He hoped, and confidently expected, that these conversations would find the two Governments in complete agreement. He recognised that the agenda was long, and time was short. He would not, therefore, waste any time at the opening, and enquired whether the agenda which had been drawn up (Annex I; was agreeable to the French Ministers, and whether they had any observations regarding the order in which the subjects should be taken.* These notes were made for information only and do not constitute an agreed official record.9856   [17137] copy No.6 printed for the use of the Foreign Office. -
M. DALADIER wished to assure Mr. Chamberlain and His Majesty&apos;s Government generally of their gratitude for the cordial reception they had received. His first words, therefore, were to thank Mr. Chamberlain and congratulate him on his realism in concluding an agreement of the greatest importance for European peace. The French Government fully appreciated the value of the **Anglo-Italian Agreement. As regards th&apos;e question which Mr. Chamberlain had asked, the French Ministers gladly accepted the agenda as a basis of discussion, and had no observations to offer in that connexion.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN suggested that it might be convenient to take Items 7 (contacts between the British and French Air Staffs) and 8 (purchase, perhaps on a joint basis, of supplies such as food-stuffs and petrol in time of war) after Item 3, instead of as they were placed on the agenda. He thought it would be advantageous to make this rearrangement.M. DALADIER agreed.1. Anglo-Italian and Franco-Italian Relations.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN suggested that it would be most convenient if he asked Lord Halifax to open this question.LORD HALIFAX did not think it was necessary to say a great deal regarding the Anglo-Italian Agreement, as His Majesty&apos;s Government had kept the French Government fully informed of the events leading up to the signature of the agreement, and the terms had been in the hands of the French Government for some time. It was a matter of profound satisfaction to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to have beard M. Daladier&apos;s recognition of the importance the French Government attached to the agreement which His Majesty&apos;s Government had reached with the Italian Government. His Majesty&apos;s Government had also warmly welcomed the intention of the French Government to conduct the conversations upon which they had embarked with the Italian Government, with a view to arriving at a similar conclusion. His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed at some convenient moment during the forthcoming session of the League Council to make a statement on the outcome of our recent conversations in Rome. They would stress-a point to which M. Daladier had drawn attention the contribu-tion which this agreement represented towards appeasement in international affairs. He hoped that perhaps other States represented on the Council would be ready to express their satisfaction at the results obtained. As the French Government were aware, the entry into force of the Anglo-Italian Agreement had expressly been made dependent upon a settlement of - the Spanish question. This would be discussed later in the conversations, together with the action we proposed to take at a later stage in regard to the recognition of Italian sovereignty over Abyssinia. If and when His Majesty&apos;s Government made a declaration on the lines outlined above at Geneva, it would be very valuable to His Majesty&apos;s Government if the French Government felt able on that occasion publicly to express their satisfaction. Perhaps also, although the French Govern-ment would be in the best position to form a judgment on this point, such a declaration might also help the French Government in the conversations upon which they had embarked with the Italian Government.M. BONNET said that the French Government had, in fact, opened negotia-tions with the Italian Government. In these negotiations the essence of the French Government&apos;s requirements was that the , Italian Government should give guarantees of appeasement similar to those contained in the Anglo-Italian Agreement. As His Majesty&apos;s Government were aware, the French Government would have liked to be associated with the Anglo-Italian negotiations. This had not been possible, but on learning of the happy conclusion of these negotia-tions, the French Government had then indicated their desire to open negotiations themselves. He wished to point out that it seemed to him important, in the interests of the Anglo-Italian Agreement itself, that the present negotiations between France and Italy should reach a successful conclusion.The French Government attached special importance to one point in their negotiations. They were asking Italy to recognise her readiness to negotiate the convention about Tunisia and the position of Italian subjects in Tunisia, fore-
shadowed in the Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935; there was nothing new in this demand, and the French Government did not think the Italian Government should properly raise any objections, especially as the latter had in 1937 already recog-riised the 1935 agreement. This was an essential point to which the French Government attributed^he greatest importance. It would be extremely dangerous if Italy would not agree to this point, since this would indicate that Italy might have ultimate designs upon Tunisia, and especially upon the Port of Bizerta; there could not then be any real peace in the Mediterranean. He wished- to make it clear that Italy had not yet made any reservations on this point, but it was a question of capital importance. Apart from this he did not think there should be any difficulties, and the French Government had already received indications that the Italian Government were ready to accept the French requirements in other respects. He wished to express the hope that in the event of the Italian Government raising difficulties in regard to Tunisia, His Majesty&apos;s Government might be prepared to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome to do what he could to help the French Government in this particular respect. Without an agreement regarding Tunisia, he feared that the whole work of pacification, repre-sented by the Anglo-Italian Agreement and the present Franco-Italian conversations, would only be a dead letter.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN took note of M. Bonnefs statement and recognised its importance. He said that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to do anything they could through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome in this connexion if there were any occasion for such assistance. He could not believe that this was a matter which would raise difficulties from the Italian side.LORD HALIFAX agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government would, of course, do all they could if opportunity offered. There was, however, a point which he thought the French Government should bear in mind. Whilst we would, of course, do all we could to meet the French Governments request, it had to be remembered that the Italian Government had been rather difficult when; in the course of our own negotiations, we had tried to get them to agree to giving similar assurances about Syria to those which they were prepared to give in respect of Palestine. The Italian Government had then taken the line that Syria was a matter for the French rather than for ourselves, and they had rather resented the suggestion that we were trying to do the business of the French. Subject to this reservation, we should, however, of course, do all we could to help the French at Rome.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN suspected that the Italian Government considered that there might be some hard bargaining in their negotiations with the French, and had therefore wished to give nothing away in advance,M. DALADIER expressed his agreement.M. BONNET wished to add a word regarding certain reserves which he had formulated in connexion with the Anglo-Italian Agreement to prevent any doubt being left in the minds of the British Ministers. The French Government were not attempting to raise any difficulties regarding the sections in the Anglo-Italian Agreement concerning the Red Sea. But France was closely interested in the Moslem world and therefore in the two Holy Places of Islam. She also had certain interests in connexion with islands in the Red Sea. He did not anticipate any difficulties in the Franco-Italian negotiations in protecting French interests in these connexions, but France, as a great Mediterranean and Moslem Power, would have to insist on engagements similar to those which Italy had given to Great Britain also being given to France. It was in this spirit that he was formulating these reserves, and they did not in any way diminish French satisfaction at the conclusion of the Anglo-Italian Agreement.Mr. * CHAMBERLAIN thought that M. Bonnefs remarks had a close bearing on the general idea which His Majesty&apos;s Government had in mind in their negotiations with the Italian Government. The fundamental purpose of these negotiations was not to obtain advantages for Great Britain, but rather to do something which would mark a step forward in the direction of European appeasement. The efforts of His Majesty&apos;s Government would therefore be incomplete if they were confined to an Anglo-Italian understanding. The circle must be widened., His Majesty&apos;s Government would have been glad if it had been [17137] &apos; b 2
possible for the French Government to have been associated with them in their negotiations with the Italian Government. This had not been possible; we had to advance step by step. He believed that an important step forward had been taken. He would like to see the process carried further through the conclusion of a Franco-Italian Agreement. He fully appreciated the reservations which M. Bonnet had made and wished-to see a full agreement reached between France and Italy. This would be entirely in accord with the objects of His Majesty&apos;s Government in opening negotiations.M. BONNET said that what France desired in connexion with the Red Sea was for France to adhere to the sections of the Anglo-Italian Agreement concerning that area. The French Government had intimated their wishes to the Italian Government, who had replied that this question interested the British as well as the Italian Governments. Therefore, if the British Government agreed to the French demand it would obviously be easier to obtain the Italian agreement.LORD HALIFAX considered that it was a question of tactics and procedure, of which the French Government must be the best judge. So far as Great Britain was concerned, he saw no objection to the French Government saying to the Italian Government that Flis Majesty&apos;s Government had no objection to the French Government being invited to adhere to the Anglo-Italian Agreement over the Red Sea.M. BONNET thanked Lord Halifax.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked whether there were any other points which the French Ministers wished to raise before passing on to the next item.M. BONNET raised the question of the entry into force of the Anglo-Italian Agreement and enquired what was meant exactly by a settlement of the Spanish question, on which this entry into force was made dependent.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that this would be dealt with under Spain on the agenda.2. Abyssinia.LORD HALIFAX suggested that the main reason why this question should be introduced from the British side was that His Majesty&apos;s Government were responsible for placing this item on the agenda of the next Council meeting The position of His Majesty&apos;s Government was, he thought, similar to that of the French Government on this question. They had hitherto considered that the recognition of Italian sovereignty over Abyssinia was the concern of the League of Nations. Many other members of the League had, however, taken the view, and acted upon it, that their obligations had come to an end with the adoption of the Assembly resolution of the 4th July, 1936. In placing this item on the agenda of the forthcoming Council meeting His Majesty&apos;s Government had taken steps to ascertain the views of other members of the Counpil, and also of some members of the Assembly. The response had been generally favourable and no objection had so far been raised that the Council was not competent to deal with this question.In examining this question His Majesty&apos;s Government had been sensible of the great importance of avoiding placing the Council, or other members of the League, in the position of having to take a decision of principle. They considered, and he understood, that the Secretary-General of the League, M. Avenol, agreed with this view, that it would be better to find a solution on a purely practical basis. They thought, therefore, that the best plan would be to persuade the Council to pass a resolution that this question was one that each member of the Council should decide for itself in the light of its own particular position. His Majesty ^Government had prepared a draft resolution (Annex II) for submission to the League, copies of which were now communicated to the French Ministers. He hoped that the French Government, after studying the draft resolution, would in due course feel able to express their views on it.If, however, it was found impossible to get such a resolution through the Council, His Majesty&apos;s Government would then propose to fall back on an alternative solution. His Majesty&apos;s Government would themselves make a state-ment, based entirely on the facts of the situation, recording their opinion that they
thought it would not be inappropriate for each member of the League to act as it thought best on this question. There would then be a general discussion in which he hoped the British thesis would be supported by several States. His Majesty&apos;s Government hoped that this discussion would then be wound up by the President, on the lines that no formal resolution would be put, but that the President might express the general sense of the meeting as freeing members to act as they thought best without, any disloyalty to the League.To sum up, their first aim would therefore be to secure a resolution, but if this were not possible, His Majesty&apos;s Government would fall back on the alternative solution of a discussion which, it was hoped, would be summed up by the President in a sense favourable to the British thesis.One other point which he would like to mention was that the Negus, he believed, had already announced his intention to send a representative to take part in the Council proceedings. The first question that would arise was whether his representative should be permitted to sit or not. It would be necessary to consider whether the Negus could give credentials to a representative at Geneva, and some discussion must be anticipated in this connexion. The answer would, of course, largely depend upon the question of fact, i.e., was the Negus in a position to exercise effective sovereignty over Abyssinia? In such an event, His Majesty&apos;s Government would propose to say, in their capacity as a limitrophe State, that although it was true that sporadic resistance to the Italian Government existed, that did not affect the main question that the Negus had lost his effective sovereignty and could not be restored to it except by the use of external force. The fact &quot;that the Negus did not exercise effective sovereignty could not, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, be disputed. He suggested that the French Government, as a limitrophe State, might perhaps be able to take the same line on this question of fact. In addition, some States on the Council who had recognised Italian sovereignty might feel difficulties about accepting a represen-tative of the Negus. In these circumstances, the President might declare that agreement had been difficult to secure on this question, and the following compromise solution might be adopted. As an act of courtesy the Negus&apos;s repre-sentative might be allowed to address the Council, but not to vote. Such a compromise would be agreeable to His Majesty&apos;s Government and might present the best solution. Those were the lines on which it was proposed to handle this question.M. BONNET pointed out that if the resolution were to be adopted there must be unanimity on the Council. Did Lord Halifax think such unanimity could be secured %LORD HALIFAX hoped it might be possible, but he was rather doubtful. The States who might raise difficulties were China and the U.S.S.R.M. BONNET presumed that the resolution would only be presented to the Council if it were certain that unanimity could be secured. Otherwise he feared it would have a very bad effect.LORD HALIFAX agreed and informed the French Ministers that he proposed to go to Geneva a day before the Council Meeting in order to take soundings on this question. If these were unsatisfactory, the proposed resolution would not be put on paper by Flis Majesty&apos;s Government, who would fall back on the second alternative which he had outlined above.THE FRENCH MINISTERS expressed their agreement with this proposal.3. Spain.LORD HALIFAX reverted to M. Bonnet&apos;s previous question as to how we interpreted the condition we had made that the entry into force of the Anglo-Italian Agreement was dependent upon a previous settlement of the Spanish question.M. BONNET said that he wanted to know what exactly we had in mind by the words &quot; a previous settlement.&quot; Did we understand by this the definite withdrawal of foreign volunteers and material, or only an agreement in principle reached in the Non-intervention Committee. In the first case, there would obviously be considerable delay before the Agreement could enter into force.
In the latter case, the Agreement could, of course, enter into force at an early-date, but he feared there would not be any early evacuation of foreign volunteers or material from Spain.LORD HALIFAX said that he would explain what we originally had in mind at the end&apos; of February and before the beginning of the Anglo-Italian conversations. We were then in a position in which the Non-intervention Committee were about to discuss the British formula, one of whose main features was the execution of the following two essential conditions : (1) A substantial withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain, and (2) the subsequent grant of belligerent rights to both sides. It was considered that one of the principal obstacles to this formula which might be encountered was likely to be the. raising of difficulties in one form or another on the Non-intervention Committee by the Italian representative. The British plan would then have been held up, and the present unsatisfactory and dangerous state of affairs in Spain would have continued on account of Italian obstruction. His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore had in mind that the Italian Government should give their word that, so far as they were concerned, they would be as helpful as possible on the Non-intervention Committee with a view to the British plan being brought into operation. He therefore thought that it was clear that the answer to M. Bonnet&apos;s question was that His Majesty&apos;s Government certainly had then in mind the effective evacuation of foreign volunteers from Spain. On the broad questions put, the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government was still certainly that there must, on the Italian side, be real performance as distinct from mere promises. He thought he ought to point out, however, that we had never expected from the Italian Government any unilateral action, quite apart from whatever might be done by others, since this would not make for a settlement.Events had unfortunately developed in a way which differed from these anticipations. For one reason or another difficulties had arisen in connexion with the work of the Non-intervention Committee. One such difficulty had arisen in connexion with the basic figures regarding the withdrawal of foreign volunteers. Other difficulties of which the French Government were, of course, aware had arisen in regard to the reimposition of control on the Spanish frontier and to bringing into operation the machinery for the withdrawal of volunteers. His Majesty&apos;s Government had fully realised the difficulties of the French Government in this connexion, and had appreciated their willingness to help in finding a solution for them. His Majesty&apos;s Government thought that a solution could be found if a greater measure of co-operation were forthcoming from all the Goverh-ments concerned. The Italian Government had given certain assurances and undertakings which His Majesty&apos;s Government, on the information available to it, accepted, being convinced of Italy&apos;s spirit of accommodation. He thought that provided that action could be taken by all the countries concerned, the Italian Government did, in fact, now want to withdraw from Spain. It was more difficult to estimate German intentions, but he thought that the attitude of the German representative on the Non-intervention Committee would be based upon that of the Italian representative.From this point of view His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore welcomed the negotiations which had been opened between the French and Italian Governments, because any hope of progress in regard to Spain really depended upon better relations between France and Italy. His Majesty&apos;s Government were disposed to think that the latest proposal of the French Government regarding a time limit for the restoration of observers on the Spanish land frontiers might be acceptable, if the French Government did not insist on all its details being applied too rigidly. His Majesty&apos;s Government would recommend these proposals to the Non-intervention Committee, but would ask the French Government to refrain from pressing for full satisfaction on other points of less importance to the general scheme.  He thought an agreement on these lines would improve the atmosphere.Nevertheless, as practical people they must recognise that the prospects of any rapid advance in the Non-intervention Committee were not bright. Everyone was anxious to see the Spanish question settled and a danger which occupied our minds constantly thus removed. His Majesty&apos;s Government thought the French Govern-ment also had been searching for ways and means in which to speed up a settle-ment. He therefore wished to suggest that, provided some degree of progress were possible on the committee, it might be possible for progress also to be realised outside the committee.   For example, might not the French Government in their
discussions at Rome consider the possibility of reaching a more limited agreement direct with the Italian Government, which would be of such a kind as to relieve the situation in Spain? He did not propose to develop this idea further, but if the French Government approved of the suggestion, His Majesty&apos;s Government would, of course, be read$,r to help with their good offices if the French Government thought this might be useful. It seemed to His Majesty&apos;s Government a difficult, dangerous and melancholy situation if, the minute one side in Spain made an advance, support to the other side was immediately increased. There was thus a constant ebb and flow resulting in an increased loss of human life, but he doubted whether it would have any effect on the ultimate solution.M. BONNET pointed out that in reality it was clear from French customs figures that very little material had passed over the French frontier into Spain in recent weeks.LORD HALIFAX replied that it was, of course, quite impossible for him to express any useful opinion on this point. A great deal of evidence had been presented to His Majesty&apos;s Government, but he realised that much of this might be incorrect, and he was, of course, only too glad to attach the fullest weight to M. Bonnet5s statement. It remained, however, an incontestable fact that in one way or another the Spanish Government had in recent weeks been receiving supplies of material, and wherever such supplies came from and to whichever side they were sent, they could only prolong the struggle.M. BONNET pointed out that General Franco had received more than his full share of such supplies from abroad.M. DALADIER said he fully understood and sympathised with the principle of non-intervention which was expressed in the phrase &quot; Spain for the Spaniards,5&apos; and he agreed that it was for the Spaniards to decide what policy and what Government they wanted. The principle of non-intervention, if applied exactly and completely, would therefore certainly localise the conflict, and on such an assumption the only contribution of the Great Powers would be to offer their good offices with a view to a termination of the civil war. Unfortunately, this picture did not represent the true facts. The Spanish question was regarded differently in different countries, and he must emphasise the preoccupation of French public opinion over this question. Spain was a neighbour of France, and France had fought for centuries to prevent Spain falling into enemy hands. The present situation was that, even if certain countries might be reproached for helping the Spanish Government, General Franco would never have been able to continue the war without the help he had received from Italy and Germany, which amounted to thousands of soldiers and hundreds of aeroplanes.The formula of the Non-intervention Committee would be satisfactory if the withdrawal of volunteers were accompanied by the withdrawal of material. The. withdrawal of men was, in the French view, not enough. It was true that the Spanish Government had the international brigades on their side, but these now only numbered about 5,000 or 6,000 men. On the other hand, it was clear from Signor Mussolini&apos;s messages of congratulation to General Franco that a real Italian army was fighting on his side; whilst he also had at least 700 Italian and German aeroplanes. The Spanish Government, on the other hand, only had 150 aeroplanes, and this largely explained the Republican defeats. General Franco5s success had been due to his superiority in artillery and aircraft, and not to the superiority of his troops. If we only agreed to withdraw a few volunteers as a sort of symbolical gesture, and if this were immediately followed by the closing of the land frontiers and the granting of belligerent rights to both sides, M. Daladier feared that French opinion would be seriously ^alarmed and would ask whether anything had been done as regards material. If, therefore, an impartial and loyal settlement were to be reached, the French Government considered that material as well as volunteers should be withdrawn.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN was not disposed to deny the truth of M. Daladier&apos;s statement that the only satisfactory and impartial solution would be the complete withdrawal of foreign material as Well as of foreign volunteers, but as a practical man he foresaw only too clearly that we could not get such a solution. If we were to attempt to insist on the withdrawal of material pari passu with the
withdrawal of volunteers, such insistence could only block all further progress. Whilst fully appreciating the force of M. Daladier&apos;s remarks, and understanding the natural preoccupation of French public opinion over this question, he felt that it was better, from the purely practical point of view not to lay down in advance conditions which it was clear could not be satisfied. He would, therefore, prefer that both Governments should address themselves to bringing about a satisfactory solution by friendly discussion, and he hoped that on these lines some practical results might be obtained.M. DALADIER agreed that the practical difficulties were very great. He had no intention to complicate further a situation which was already sufficiently complicated; but, whilst recognising these difficulties, it seemed to him very important, if any real degree of pacification was to be reached in Spain, at least to include aviators under the heading of volunteers. In his view the term &apos;&apos; volunteer &quot; should not only mean certain brigades to be designated, but should also include volunteers in the technical arms, such as aviation, artillery, anti-aircraft, &amp;c, whom he would designate as specialist volunteers. Without wishing to complicate matters, he would therefore propose that the formula regarding the withdrawal of volunteers should be enlarged to include such technical or specialist volunteers. It was, in fact, the question of categories in which he was especially interested.LORD HALIFAX said that, in general, he did not differ from the view expressed by M. Daladier. Obviously, aviators should, in his view, be included under the general heading of volunteers; but this was not the real difficulty. The real difficulty lay in procedure by categories. It was clear to everyone that one aviator was worth many infantrymen, but if the matter were treated simply on the basis of man for man, the aviator at once became kidentical in value with the infantryman. This difficulty had been examined at great length in the Non-intervention Committee, and they had felt obliged to depart from the suggested procedure of withdrawal by categories because of the difficulty of enforcing or checking such a procedure. It would clearly be impossible to prevent the shifting of individuals from one category to another, and every sort of evasion might be practised. This procedure by categories was no doubt the best and most complete plan, but even if it were possible to go back to it, in spite of the.difficulties to which Ire had drawn attention, it would mean great delay, and would therefore be contrary to what he understood was the desire of the French Government that the commission should proceed to Spain in as short a time as possible. It would also mean much greater expense. He made these observations without wishing in any way to contest the force of M. Daladier&apos;s remarks, and he would add that British public opinion on this question was similar to French public opinion. He still felt, however, that it was better to work for some result which was practically possible, even if it presented a less satisfactory solution, in the hope that from this start might be developed a wider agreement to cover the technical services, material and the question of categories.M. DALADIER expressed himself as in agreement with the spirit of Lord Halifax&apos;s proposals. He agreed that it was perhaps better to seek a less complicated solution at present, keeping in mind the desirability of proceeding at a later stage to secure some agreement on withdrawal by categories after the present more limited agreement had been put into execution.LORD HALIFAX enquired whether he was right in understanding that M. Daladier agreed that it was desirable to put the present limited scheme immediately into execution without worrying further about the question of categories, and then, without prejudice to the execution of that scheme, do our best, in the improved atmosphere which would then exist, to formulate a wider scheme for dealing with the question of categories.M. DALADIER expressed his agreement.M. CORBIN explained that the French Government were anxious lest a limited agreement for the withdrawal of volunteers having been approved without any reservations on the question of categories, it might not be difficult to reopen the question at a later stage and propose widening the agreement to include categories.   Therefore, the French Government had in mind as their
objective a very simple resolution regarding categories which would not give rise to the objections which Lord Halifax had mentioned, that is to say, greater expense and increased delay.Me. CHAMBERLAIN said he would be very glad to see such a simplified resolution, but he could *not help feeling that it would be very difficult to draft. If, however, such a resolution could be produced from the French side he would gladly examine it. The difficulty which he saw was, of course, that if the with-drawal of volunteers began on the system at present envisaged, and not by categories, such withdrawal would naturally begin with old, tired and useless people. But he felt that even this would be valuable in itself. He would regard even the withdrawal of useless non-combatants as of some use as a practical test. He was anxious, above all, to avoid spending weeks, and perhaps even months, in discussing arrangements which would be extremely difficult in practice to work, and it was generally acknowledged that the operation of a scheme based on with-drawal by categories would be extremely difficult. After all, if aviators or artillerymen were put into the uniform of infantrymen, what check could be devised on this? He was anxious to find a solution of these difficulties, but he hoped that we should not be prevented from taking a first practical step by attempting to arrive at a perfect solution which would be extremely difficult to reach.M. CORBIN explained that the position which the French Government wished to take up in this connexion was that there were three essential questions to be considered  (1) The time limit for the restoration of land control.(2) The question of categories.(3) Reinforcement of naval control.As regards the first question, delay in the restoration of land control, the French Government would be ready to admit a formula, substantially equivalent to the British formula. They had, however, reached the maximum of concessions which they were prepared to make, and they could only envisage such alterations of form as might make the scheme more presentable. They had already agreed to an extension of the time limit from fifteen to thirty days, and they might agree to a supplementary margin if necessary. In fact, in general, they were in full agreement with the British proposal.As regards the third point, naval control, although the French Government naturally desired to reach a satisfactory solution, which would reassure French public opinion, they would be willing to agree to a formula acceptable to the British Government which was calculated to show that naval control was being effectively reinforced.As regards the second point, categories, the French Government did not wish this question to be neglected or ignored in the formula approved by the Non-intervention Committee, although they fully appreciated the difficulties to which the Prime Minister had alluded. Even if the withdrawal of aviators and other technicians was not insisted upon as an essential preliminary or as a measure to be carried out simultaneously with the withdrawal of other volunteers, some formula must be found to reassure the French public, and he thought also, the British public, that in our efforts to reach agreement upon a formula, such essential considerations were not being overlooked.LORD HALIFAX recognised the desire of the French Government to achieve some real progress in this extremely difficult matter. If he had understood M. Corbin aright, the point of view of the French Government was that they would not regard as impossible an increase in the time limit for the restoration of land control.As regards the question of naval control, he understood that the French Government wished to arrive at a formula showing that naval control was.being effectively reinforced. Would not this, however, mean the re-establishment of observers in Spanish ports ? This suggestion had been made before, but he under-stood that it had never been acted upon because of strong objections raised from the Spanish side.As regards the other question of categories, and the French desire to arrive at a formula covering this question, the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government was that they would be very&apos;willing to see the Non-intervention Committee invited to [17137] c
re-examine this question, and see if agreement could be reached upon any formula which the French Government might wish to put forward. It would, however, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, be very regrettable if this further examination resulted in further delay in making progress in any part of the wide field to be covered. He enquired whether the French Government could make it plain whether, in their view, it would be possible first to achieve progress on the lines hitherto envisaged in the Non-intervention Committee, and simultaneously to examine whether a;further and wider formula could be approved on the question of categories; or whether, in the view of the French Government, they considered that progress &quot;on the lines hitherto envisaged should be held up whilst an effort was made to reach agreement on the wider formula. If the second alternative represented the view of the French Government he could only regret it.M. CORBIN explained that the spirit in which the French Government&apos;s views had been advanced was essentially to facilitate the conclusion of an agreement. The French Government had no wish to raise any difficulties to prevent this. In order to reply to the precise questions which Lord Halifax had just asked, he suggested that the best course would be if the French Government were in the very near future to communicate to the British Government a note laying down very precisely the French views in regard to categories and the reinforcement of naval control. The French Government thought that progress could be made on these different points simultaneously with the successful execution of the more limited formula presented by&apos;Lord Plymouth, and that no delay need necessarily arise inthe latter respect.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN thought it was clear that it was not possible at this table to solve questions which had been remitted to the Non-intervention Committee, but he suggested that if understanding could be reached here, the work of the committee would be facilitated. He would be glad to see the proposals which the French Government would put forward in the manner suggested by M. Corbin. He would, however, express the hope that this note would hot be too precise on the question of categories. He was afraid that too great precision would only result in further haggling and boggling in the Non-intervention Committee, which could only delay the achievement of practical results. He would like to revert to Lord Halifax&apos;s previous suggestion, that if this question could be discussed direct between the French and Italian Governments in the course of the conversations which had been begun in Rome, this might be found to be the shortest way out of these difficulties.M. BONNET pointed out that in the instructions sent to the French Charge d&apos;Affaires at Rome&apos;, M. Blondel, the latter had been told to aim at a formula equivalent to the British formula which Would render the entry into force of the Franco-Italian Agreement, if and when this was concluded, dependent upon a prior settlement of the Spanish question. M. Blondel had recently informed M. Bonnet in Paris that Count Ciano had informed him semi-officially that he might make reservations in this connexion; although the French Government had only suggested such a clause in order to make the Franco-Italian Agreement correspond generally with the Anglo-Italian Agreement. In view of Count Ciano&apos;s attitude, he feared therefore that difficulties might be raised from the Italian side. ! &quot;    -----Mr. CHAMBERLAIN suggested that although no doubt reservations were being made beforehand by the Italian Government, if the latter really wanted to come to an agreement too much importance should not be attached to such reservations.M. BONNET pointed out that the conversations between Count Ciano and the French Charge d&apos;Affaires indicated that the Italian Government intended to ask France to be content with the assurances which had already been given to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Italy therefore appeared to intend the Spanish question to be settled between Great Britain and France.LORD HALIFAX said that the Ambassador in Paris had given His Majesty&apos;s Government similar information; but it had notleftthe same impression on their minds. He suggested that the Italian attitude might be that: in&apos;so far as they had already given explicit assurances to His Majesty&apos;s1 Government, if the French Government insisted on a repetition of the same assurances; this
might give the impression to the Italian public. that the French Government were casting doubt on the assurances given to the British Government. He suggested that a solution of this particular difficulty might be found in the French Government refraining from asking the Italian Government for new assurances to which the latter might raise objections, but taking note of the assurances given to. His Majesty&apos;s Government on a question which was of vital importance to the French Government.M. BONNET thought that the explanation suggested by Lord , Halifax was not the correct one, for on many other points in the proposed agreement the Italian Government had-agreed to repeat to the French Government the assurances already given to His Majesty&apos;s Government. There could not, therefore, be any objection of principle to giving the same assurances twice. If, therefore, the Italian Government were raising difficulties only over repeating their assurances regarding Spain, he thought the reason lay rather in the Italian Governments view that the French Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded the Spanish question from rather different angles. Nevertheless, to avoid raising any further difficulties he would be ready to agree to a formula on the lines suggested by Lord Halifax.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN suggested that the matter might be left on the under-standing that the French Government would very shortly present a note containing their suggestions on the three points mentioned above, i.e. : (1) restoration of land control; (2) categories; and (3) the reinforcement of naval control.LORD HALIFAX considered, however, that the French and British Ministers were already in general agreement, and that it was of great importance to make rapid progress in some effective fashion. What M. Bonnet had said regarding the attitude of the Italian Government on this question confirmed in his view that much good might come from direct contacts between the French and Italian Governments since both were in a better position to contribute effectively to a solution than His Majesty&apos;s Government who had neither sent volunteers to Spain nor had any land frontiers with Spain.M. CORBIN, in reply to an enquiry from the Prime Minister, said that the French note would be sent on the next day if possible.7. Staff Conversations.LORD HALIFAX suggested that it was important to review, very briefly, past history:. On the 24th March His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris informed the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, with reference to the obligations assumed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom towards France under the Treaty of Locarno, that with a view to implementing their obligations in the case of unpro-provoked aggression, His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed at an early date to authorise confidential communications, on a technical footing, between the British and French Air Staffs. His Majesty&apos;s Government promised to make a further communication to the French Government on this subject in due course.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom had now given further consideration to this question, and they desired to take this opportunity of explaining in greater detail what they had in mind.His Majesty&apos;s Government considered that the communications that will now be undertaken between the British and French staffs should be regarded as arising out of the second paragraph of section III of the arrangement reached in London on the 19th March, 1936, after the occupation by Germany of the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland, and as being covered by the understanding reached between the two Governments at that time, as expressed in the notes exchanged on the 1st Apml, 1936, that such contacts between the two staffs should be clearly under-stood on both sides not to give rise in respect of either Government to any political undertaking, nor to any obligation regarding the organisation of national defence. His Majesty&apos;s Government would also wish it to be clearly understood that the contacts now proposed will not give rise to any obligation regarding the employ -ment of defence forces.His Majesty&apos;s Government would suggest that the political assumption upon which the proposed staff contacts would be founded should be confined to the [17137] c 2
obligations undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards France and Belgium under the Treaty of Locarno; and by France towards the United Kingdom in the statement made by M. Delbos on the 4th December, 1936, as reaffirmed by the French Government in their memorandum of the 9th April, 1938. Germany alone wtould be assumed to be the aggressor, and the contacts would not envisage the extension of war to other Powers, whether as potential enemies or as potential allies. His Majesty&apos;s Government, after the fullest consideration, did not consider that any political assumptions going beyond this were either necessary or desirable at the present time.His Majesty&apos;s Government also took this opportunity to inform the French Government what, in their judgment, would in present circumstances be. the character of their participation in a war arising in the circumstances outlined above. So far as His Majesty&apos;s Government were concerned and this would also, he imagined, be true of the French Government the first and main effort of each of us must be directed to home defence. His Majesty&apos;s Government were, more-over, compelled to ensure the preservation of the trade routes, with all that that involved. This implied the defence of British territories overseas. His Majesty&apos;s Government were, as the French Government were aware, at present engaged in the reorganisation and re-equipment of their land defence forces. As a result of these two considerations, His Majesty&apos;s Government had come to the conclusion, which would be no surprise to the French Government, that the form which their assistance to France on the hypothesis we were contemplating would chiefly take, would be by sea and in the air.As regards naval contacts, in view of the fact that the effective co-operation of the British and French fleets could be concerted very quickly after the outbreak of war, and since the political assumption which he had mentioned earlier and which formed the basis of this communication did not call for any redistribution in time of peace of the British and French fleets, it was not, in our judgment, necessary to hold naval staff conversations at present.So far as the air position and the contacts between the two air staffs were concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Government would propose that confidential communica-tions should be conducted on a technical footing between the British and French air staffs, and that those conversations should have the following scope : (a) An interchange of information as to the capacity of the two air forcesat the present time, and the extent to which this may be expected to develop in the future;(b) Plans for the movement to France on the outbreak of war and the subse-quent maintenance and protection in France of a British advanced air striking force. Full discussion regarding the aerodromes and other facilities which would be required in France for this purpose;(c) The co-ordination of the two air defence systems, including the linking-upof the observation and warning systems. Arrangements for the passage of Royal Air Force bombers, both home based and advanced, over the territory covered by the French air defence system;(d) A general discussion of the methods by which the two, air forces mightco-ordinate their operations in war, due regard being paid to the fact that the primary duty of each country is to provide for its own defence.His Majesty&apos;s Government would propose that in the first instance these communications should be opened through the respective air attaches, and that they might be pursued in connexion with the exchange of visits by air force officers which might take place from time to time. It might also be found desirable at a later stage for British air force officers to visit French aerodromes.So far as purely land forces are concerned they had &quot;reached the conclusion that in present circumstances, with the best will in the world, the greatest measure of help that they could in present circumstances immediately hope to contribute, if the Government of the day, after considering their other military commitments at home and abroad to which he had alluded, should decide to despatch a military force to France, would be two divisions. The War Office had intimated, however, that these divisions would not necessarily be completely equipped with material regarded as essential for modern war, and they might also be short in certain effectives. This force could be landed in France within fourteen days from the date on which the decision was taken to despatch it. His Majesty&apos;s Government would emphasise that the statement which they were now making referred to the
situation as it existed at this moment. His Majesty&apos;s Government would keep the situation under review, and, if in course of time any modification of this statement was called for, His Majesty&apos;s Government would make a further communication to the French Goverment.His Majesty&apos;s Government would accordingly be glad to learn from the French Government &quot;whether the establishment of contacts betv/een the two air staffs on the basis outlined above would be acceptable to the French Government.There was one other connected matter to which he wished to draw attention. His Majesty&apos;s Government had given some thought to the question whether both sides should agree to keep the suggested conversations secret or treat this matter differently. His Majesty&apos;s Government were inclined, subject to the views of the French Government, to think it would be wiser to forestall any undesirable reactions in Germany or in Italy by telling the German and Italian Governments frankly that we were having air staff Conversations, if it were so decided, and telling them on what basis these were being held. His Majesty&apos;s Governments anxiety lay in the fact that it would probably not be possible, and might not even be desirable, to keep these conversations secret. If they became known, feelings of suspicion or resentment might well be generated in Germany or Italy which a preliminary communication might obviate. He had, therefore, drafted a telegram to the British Ambassadors in Berlin and Rome, but before sending off this telegram he would appreciate the views of the French Government as to whether they concurred in the proposed telegram.(Copies of the draft telegram (Annex III) were communicated to the meeting.)The French Ministers said they would like to consider this telegram before the afternoon session.(The meeting then adjourned.)SECOND MEETING, APRIL 28, 2 45 p.m. 7. Staff Conversations (continued).M. DALADIER thanked His Majesty&apos;s Government, and in particular the Prime Minister and Lord Halifax, for the extremely interesting communication made to them before lunch, containing detailed and precise proposals on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government. He wished to state frankly and loyally that, as regards the general policy of the two countries, both Governments would no doubt have to consider very carefully their views on the general situation. We were arriving at what might be termed almost a dramatic moment in the life of Europe. But for the present he did not wish to enlarge on these general considerations, and preferred to keep strictly to the precise technical considerations advanced in His Majesty&apos;s Governments communication.(a) The Air. As regards the co-operation of the air forces, the&apos;ideas of His Majesty&apos;s Government were, in general, perfectly satisfactory to the French Government and would provide for a very useful co-ordination of the forces of the two countries which should be sufficient to form an important contribution to general pacification.(b) The Army. He felt, however, that the defence of a country&apos;s territory demanded the co-operation of all its armed forces. From this logical premise the French Government had set up a Ministry of National Defence. In England we had in Sir T. Inskip a Minister for the Co-ordination of National Defence. In Germany Field-Marshal von Blomberg&apos; had exercised control over the whole national defence, and he, M. Daladier, exercised similar powers in France. It was extremely difficult to separate the component parts in the national defence system without serious disadvantages, endangering their harmonious co-operation. He therefore considered it indispensable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to analogous steps being taken in the case of the two armies to those which were proposed for the two air forces. The air force and the army had to work in the closest co-operation. The arrangements necessary for air bases and for the linking-up of the observation and. warning systems would necessitate the
closest co-operation between the army and the air force, He. considered that it would be extremely.useful if, at the beginning of a conflict, Great Britain could send two divisions to France. He fully appreciated that Great Britain had many Other demands.,which she had to meet, and it would not therefore be right to ask for more than this. But he considered that these two divisions would be more useful, if they, were: both motorised divisions. The French Government under-stood that in view of the great efforts Great Britain was making on sea and in the air, she could not do anything on the same scale a,s regards her land armaments. But two motorised divisions were surely not too much to ask. It was, after all, not a question of effectives, but of material, and he thought it ought not to be beyond the capacity of British industry to equip these divisions accordingly. He knew that British . industry could construct extremely well tanks and other requirements of mechanised troops. The French Government would therefore welcome a decision to motorise these two divisions, and so make the British military effort on the outbreak of war of much greater utility. To sum up, as regards land armaments, the French Government would be glad if the British Government could agree to (1) Motorising the two divisions to be sent to France. (2) Certain contacts between the Army Staffs.(c) The Navy. As regards the navy, M. DALADIER wished to point out that the French navy had two main tasks. The first and. most important was the defence of French interests in the Mediterranean and in North Africa. But an Atlantic fleet was also necessary, especially in view of recent events in Spain. The Mediterranean route might be interrupted, and it might therefore be necessary to send French colonial contingents to France by the Atlantic route. Provision was being made in the French budget for important improvements in the port of Dakar, with a view to bringing troops from Dakar by the Atlantic route in time of war. The French navy had these two essential roles, and he repeated that the role of the Atlantic fleet was of particular&quot; importance after recent events in. Spain. He fully appreciated the position of the British Admiralty, and did not wish to wound the Admiralty&apos;s susceptibilities in any way, but he thought it^, should be possible for. the Admiralty to make a gesture and agree in time of peace to effect the contacts which would immediately become necessary in time of war.He would finally emphasise in all good faith that he felt it was wrong to . regard national defence as something which could be cut up into sections.  On the contrary, the co-operation of all the national forces was essential for the defence of a country.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN thanked M. Daladier for his frank and loyal exposition of French views on this important question. It was, of course, impossible to deny the logic of the views he had expressed regarding the inseparability of-the different parts of a country/s defence forces. But His Majesty&apos;s Government considered that if these conversations-were to be useful it was essential to be frank. There was a difference between the position now and the position in, 1914. Conditions had greatly changed, and, in particular, the air force was on a completely different scale. In Great Britain an air force of a very formidable character was being built up, and His Majesty&apos;s Government anticipated that this air force in case of war would play a part out of all propor-tion to that played by the British air force in the Great War.The fact must, however, be faced that, although our resources were great, they were not unlimited. Not only had His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider the demands on industry which were being made in connexion with the air force, but ^they also had to consider, the position as regards munitions.. Here again there had been an important change since 1914. For example, it was no longer possible confidently to count upon being able to purchase munitions, from the United States to the same extent as had been possible during, the Great War.Mr. Chamberlain felt he was at some disadvantage in discussing technical military questions on which M. Daladier was an expert; but, judging from the advice they received from their technical advisers, His Majesty&apos;s Government had to contemplate that, in the event of.war arising with Germany, that country would endeavour to bring about a decision at the earliest possible moment by what has been called &quot; a knock-out blow.&quot;   Germany was well aware that in a long war
her chances of final victory were much smaller. Therefore, it was to be expected that she would make a very great effort in the first days of a war. It was therefore necessary to be prepared to resist attack on a tremendous scale in the early days. So far as this country was concerned, the only possible form of attack was from the air. It was for this reason that His Majesty ?s Government were paying such great attention to the air force, and were developing it to the extent which was well known to the French Ministers.His Majesty&apos;s Government also had to bear in mind that the demands upon their resources arising from wastage in the early days of the war would be extremely great. A war potential was, therefore, being built up in the shape of factories which would not normally be in operation, but which would come into operation as soon as the crisis arose. It might be necessary to produce munitions, under which term he included every kind of military equipment, on a scale much larger than in the Great War, because we might in a, future war be entirely dependent upon our own resources. In this connexion, His Majesty&apos;s Government also had to consider the question of man power. It would obviously not be possible successfully to fulfil the industrial considerations to which he had just drawn attention, and provide equipment, &amp;c, to the required extent and at the same time send a British army to serve abroad on the same scale as in the Great War.These limitations had been readily recognised by M. Daladier, who had stated that an expeditionary force such as that mentioned by Lord Halifax would be extremely useful if it were motorised. He was not quite sure exactly what was meant by the term &quot;motorised.&quot; Although the British divisions would, of course, be mechanised to a much greater extent than they had been in 1914, he admitted that they were not at present fully mechanised in accordance with modern conceptions. He must, however, emphasise that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment found.it difficult to commit themselves at this stage to sending even such a comparatively small force to the continent in certain eventualities. He could only say that the Government of the day might decide to do so, or they might not. In these circumstances he was doubtful how far conversations between the Army Staffs of the two countries, such as M. Daladier had proposed, could be really useful at this stage. They could only be conducted on the hypothetical basis he had explained; He would be glad if conversations on such a limited and hypothetical basis were thought useful, but, in his view, the military participa-tion of Great Britain in a war on the Continent would not be on a sufficient scale to justify conversations between, the Army&apos; Staffs on the same lines &quot;as those envisaged between the Air Staffs. The British effort in the air would be much greater and would be rendered immediately. He wished the French Government to have all these facts clearly in their minds.In reply to a question from M. Corbin, Mr. Chamberlain stated that he saw no particular objection of principle to conversations being opened between the Naval Staffs, but His Majesty&apos;s Government could not help feeling that there was really nothing special requiring discussion so far as the two Navies were concerned. He fully appreciated the remarks M. Daladier had made about the use of the Atlantic route for French reinforcements, but he doubted whether this made special conversations between the two navies necessary.M. DALADIER clearly understood the special difficulties which would be created by German aggression. Germany had the advantage of being able to prepare her aggression in advance and to open an offensive without warning. France and Great Britain, on the contrary, were peace-loving nations and would certainly not be the first to strike. It was therefore very likely that they would have to be prepared to receive the first shock. In his view this was, however, an additional reason for co-ordinating our forces well in advance and preparing our resistance so far as it was possible to do so. He did not believe that great nations could be put out of action by a sudden sharp attack. In modern war the power of the defensive remained extremely strong, i&apos; This had been illustrated in the Spanish war.&apos; On many occasions a weak screen of machine guns behind barbed wire had often resisted much more numerous and well armed troops. Provided all the armed forces of which the two countries disposed could be co-ordinated, he did not doubt our capacity successfully to resist aggression.. M. Daladier fully appreciated the great effort which Great Britain was making in respect of her air armaments. So far as France was concerned he could state quite definitely that the French army was certainly in a condition in which it could confront the German army victoriously.  He admitted that the
French air force was unfortunately not in an equally good state of preparation and was, in many respects, behindhand. He could, however, assure the British Ministers that great progress had been made in recent months. Four milliard francs were being devoted to the production of aircraft an$ 1 milliard francs to the equipment of air factories. The French difficulties did not lie in individual types, since the French types were, in many cases, faster than the German types. The French weakness lay in the transition from the production of types to industrial production on a large scale. The French aircraft industry had remained an industry on an artisan basis, which had been frightened of embarking on any great expenditure or large-scale production. The aircraft which had been invented as long as three years ago were, in themselves, fully equal to the German aircraft. But mass production was not yet taking place on a sufficient scale. The French Government had concentrated upon the eradication of this main weakness by developing the aircraft industry and improving its equipment to facilitate mass production. The Air Minister, M. de la Chambre, had already achieved considerable progress and, by the end of the summer, the French Govern-ment hoped to double their present production. He had explained the position quite openly to the British Ministers and admitted that it was still necessary to make a considerable effort.He considered, however, that aviation by itself, could not win a war. The cohesion and co-ordination of all the component parts in the national defence system was essential and, in his view, the army remained the predominant factor. Nevertheless, he fully realised the importance of the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks regarding industrial production, and agreed that it was necessary to make a great effort in this respect in France, and also, he thought, in Great Britain. In this connexion he could not help&quot; feeling that the potential resources of French and British industry were much greater than they had been in 1914, since immense progress had been made since that date. He would recall that already, at the end of the war, French aircraft construction had reached the figure of 3,000 a month, and it was certain that the means of production had greatly increased since 1918.He went on to suggest that it would be a wise measure to approach American industry now in regard to munition supplies without awaiting for the actual outbreak of war, and so obtain supplies and establish contacts capable of further development when needed. The French Government had already sent a mission to the United States to purchase American aeroplanes; somewhat to his surprise the mission had discovered that it seemed possible to obtain immediately the French Governments particular requirement, i.e., 100-150 Curtis fighters. Fewer difficulties had been encountered in this respect than he had expected. He repeated, therefore, his suggestion that American industry should be approached at this stage and that the way should thus be prepared for enlarging the. scope of our demands upon American industry should need arise. Fie also thought it important not to neglect the Netherlands as a potential supplier of aeroplanes. He considered that the Fokker aeroplanes were as good as any others. It should not be forgotten that Fokker had offered his aircraft to France in the Great War, and when she had refused them, they had been accepted by Germany, with the result that for six months these Fokkers maintained complete air superiority over the British and French air force. There were, in his view, great possibilities for arranging sales and contracts with the United States and with the Nether-lands, and perhaps also with other countries. Collaboration between France and Great Britain could also be organised and developed. For example, France could give to Great Britain certain of her tank designs, which were stronger and better than any others. She could also communicate particulars of her armoured plate, in which she had made great progress.v M. Daladier then turned to the question of collaboration between the two armies. If two British divisions were sent to France, even though these divisions were incompletely equipped, measures must be taken in advance for the disembarkation of these divisions and for their installation in France. Contacts between the two staffs were therefore necessary with this object in view in time of peace, and some conversations must take place, as it would be impossible oh the outbreak of war to improvise the necessary arrangements for dealing with such a delicate and complicated matter.He thought that it should not be impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to meet the difficulties of mechanising these two divisions.   France, had already
motorised ten divisions. He would suggest that it might be easier for a great industrial country like Great Britain fully to motorise these divisions and so to economise in men, taking advantage of the fact that in modern war improvements in material permitted an economy in man-power, which could only be welcome to His Majesty&apos;s Goverament. &apos;As regards the question of naval contacts, if he had understood Mr. Chamber-lain correctly His Majesty&apos;s Government did not see any great objection in principle to the establishment of contact between the Naval Staffs, but were uncertain by what practical means and for what purpose such contacts should be established. He would suggest that if no difficulty in principle existed it should not be impossible to devise means for establishing such contacts which would be essential in time of war. In his view it would therefore only be wise to consider the problem beforehand in time of peace. To sum up, M. Daladier wished to emphasise that whatever importance was attached to any one factor in the general scheme of national defence it remained true that war represented one single complex problem and required that all the resources of a country should be brought into operation for the national defence.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN felt that this conversation would have helped to clarify the situation. He would deal first with the question of air forces. What M. Daladier had said regarding the French air forces was not news to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and he was delighted that such great and successful efforts had been and were being made to increase the efficiency of the French air force. In Great Britain a great air force was now being built up in the shortest possible time, and His Majesty&apos;s Government had for their part been impressed with the great difficulties, often quite unexpected, which arose in the course of such an effort. In spite of the efforts which were being made it must, however, be some time before the two air forces would be in a completely satisfactory condition. M. Daladier had suggested that the industrial resources of France and Great Britain were now much greater than they had been in 1914. This was no doubt the case, but, on the other hand, a modern aeroplane was a very much more complicated and expensive machine than those which France had been able to produce at the rate of 3,000 a month in 1918.He had been glad to learn that the French Government were investigating the possibility of filling up gaps in their air defence from sources of supply outside France. His Majesty&apos;s Government had also recently sent a mission to the United States of America not in order to purchase machines but to investigate the possibilities of making use of the American aircraft industry. He thought that collaboration between the French and British Governments would be desirable in order to avoid any overlapping in this connexion.He wished to put forward another consideration. M. Daladier had very justly emphasised the great power of the defensive in modern warfare and illustrated this by the example of the Spanish civil war. Although he was not himself an expert in these matters, he had formed the same impression, that the power of the defensive was generally on the increase. It had been shown that forms of attack previously considered irresistible could be met if the defence was sufficiently organised. It must, however, be admitted that Great Britain and France had been to some extent caught unawares by developments in Germany. The power of the offensive had been developed in Germany at such a rate that our own defensive measures had not kept pace with it. Our policy must, therefore, aim at securing a respite to develop our defensive resources to such an extent that, even if the power of the offensive on the other side had meanwhile developed at an increasing pace, we would then be able to regard it calmly and to resist an offensive victoriously if necessary. At the present moment we were, however, very far from this position and were extremely vulnerable.The a^bove considerations had a bearing on the question of staff conversations. They had seen recently the development of increasingly intimate relations between Germany and Italy. This had not got to the stage of an alliance, but until quite recently the Berlin-Rome axis had grown continuously stronger. The results of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, followed up by the Franco-Italian conversations, should presumably be to weaken the axis to some extent, but, in view of the weak-ness at present of our defensive position, he thought it necessary to be very careful not to undo any good which had been achieved by these conversations with Italy by exciting Italian or German suspicions that we were now devising fresn military, naval or aerial combinations designed to injure those two Powers. [17137] ^ i)
. He thought it most important to bear this consideration in mind. He agreed that contacts between the two Air Staffs were essential if we were to carry out our obligations under the Treaty of Locarno. But he did not think there was the same urgency in regard to naval conversations. He feared that these might still arouse Italian suspicions. Although, therefore, he would repeat that His Majesty&apos;s Government had no objection of principle to such naval conversations, he would suggest that it would be better tactics to begin with the air conversations and leave naval contacts to a later stage. He did not wish to be dogmatic in this respect, and was ready to consider any proposal which the French Ministers might wish to make. He wondered whether there was really any urgency about naval contacts. For example, it seemed to him that the Atlantic problem to which M. Daladier had alluded was really a matter for the French fleet, and not for co-operation between the two navies.As regards the army, he was not himself sufficiently familiar with the details of army equipment to say exactly what would be required to convert two British divisions into fully motorised divisions. They were, of course, already mechanised to some extent. This point could, however, be discussed la/ter when conversations took place. He wished, however, to make it clear at this stage that His Majesty&apos;s Government had no desire to commit themselves to sending two British divisions to France on the outbreak of war. The most he could definitely say was that this possibility was not excluded if the Government of the day decided accordingly. During the course of the war we might, of course, send more than two divisions. The British public were, however, very nervous about land commitments, and His Maj-esty&apos;s Government were anxious to avoid being drawn unconsciously and against their will into any engagements regarding the assistance they could render on land in a continental war which might prevent them utilising British armed forces in the way considered most desirable in the national interest on the outbreak of war. Therefore, to undertake to equip two divisions specifically for a war on the continent, rather than for the general purposes which His Majesty&apos;s Government at present envisaged, would be, in fact, a commitment which His Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared to undertake. If, however, the above considerations were clearfy understood, he would not see any objection to conversations being opened between the two army staffs in regard to the arrange-ments necessary for disembarkation and installation on the purely hypothetical basis that the two British divisions might be sent to France within fifteen days of the outbreak of war if the Government of the day so decided. He did not, however, want the French General Staff to draw up their plans on an assumption which might not be borne out in the event of war.M. DALADIER appreciated that His Majesty&apos;s Government found it necessary to avoid alarming British public opinion, and he understood their reluctance to risk strengthening the bonds between Germany and Italy by taking indiscreet or inopportune measures at this moment. Nevertheless, it was essential for the French authorities to study in advance how they were to, organise the disembarkation in France and the installation of two British divisions on French territory. Two divisions would not, of course, be a contribution of. capital importance in the event of war, but they would have a great moral importance. For example, they might influence Belgium in deciding whether to remain neutral or not, and their presence in France might permit the French Government to remove troops from the northern frontier, and to concentrate them on the eastern frontier. He thought that if the military attaches could be authorised to consider how to effect the transportation and installation of these divisions, this would be sufficient for the present. As regards naval conversations^ he suggested that contacts through the naval attaches might be envisaged after the proposed contacts had already been established between the Air Staffs.LORD HALIFAX said that if he had rightly understood M. Daladier, the following conclusions had been reached :  (1) As regards air contacts, the two Governments were in agreement;(2) As regard army contacts, His Majesty&apos;s Government recognised the force of what M. Daladier had said regarding the moral importance vis-a-vis other countries of. having even so small a force as two British divisions on French soil. Subject to a . full appreciation of Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s statement on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the effect that they could not be under any definite commitment to
send even two divisions to France on the outbreak of war, although, circumstances might no doubt develop in such a way that more would, in fact, be sent later, and on that understanding His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be unwilling for the military position to be examined%rin the manner contemplated by M. Daladier.&apos; It would be convenient if such contacts were established through the medium of the military attaches, as was already contemplated for the first stage of the air contacts.&apos; Mr. CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that such contacts would include the exchange of information about material, e.g., tanks, &amp;c.LORD HALIFAX said that as regards naval contacts, it would be satisfactory to His Majesty&apos;s Government, as he understood it would also be satisfactory to M. Daladier, that this matter should be examined by the two Governments, and that their views should be exchanged at a later stage without prejudice to the air and army contacts which would begin immediately.- M. BONNET was under the impression that Mr. Chamberlain had been more positive as regards the navy and had accepted an arrangement which would give greater satisfaction to the French Government. If he had understood Mr. Chamberlain aright, a decision should be taken at this meeting for the establishment of contacts between Naval Staffs, although such a decision would only be put into execution at a later stage. Lord Halifax&apos;s suggestion differed from his understanding of the position, in that further conversations would still be required before such a decision of principle could be reached, whereas in the view of the French Government this should be decided at these conversations, even if the actual establishment of naval contacts was deferred until a more opportune moment. He pointed out that the opportunities for conversations between British and French Ministers at which such decisions could be taken were not very frequent.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN wondered whether . such a decision was really important in practice. British objections to the establishment of naval contacts were based not on principle, but only on expediency. Circumstances might change; but we could not determine in advance when they would so change. He would therefore suggest that it might be left open to decide at a later date the moment at which it would be desirable to begin naval conversations. In a week or so Herr Hitler would be meeting Signor Mussolini in Rome and that seemed to him a reason for not arriving at any definite decision at this moment. It was, after all, necessary to be extremely prudent to avoid any possible misunder-standings in Rome or Berlin.M. BONNET suggested that such considerations need not prevent a definite decision of principle being reached at this meeting, which could be made public at a later and more favourable moment, e.g., after the Rome meeting, to which Mr. Chamberlain had just alluded.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN preferred to leave it on record that His Majesty&apos;s Government raised no objection of principle to the opening of conversations on naval matters; but he left it open to determine, in further discussion between the two Governments, the date on which such conversations should be opened.M. DALADIER expressed his agreement with such a formula.LORD HALIFAX explained that there was no real difference between the British and French sides. There was certainly no question of principle dividing them. They understood each other&apos;s minds and His Majesty&apos;s Government had implicit confidence in the French Government, as they hoped the latter had in His Majesty&apos;s Government, but if anything were done at this table, which, if it became public at a later stage, could plausibly give the Italian Government the impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government had agreed to naval conversations at a moment when the sealing-w^ax was scarcely dry on the Anglo-Italian Agreement, this might have the most dangerous results. He would therefore prefer not to go beyond the position that no decision had actually been reached, but that there was a common understanding that both Governments could communicate with each other as and when the moment appeared opportune.[17137] r. 2
M. DALADIER expressed his agreement and added that when it was a question of mutual confidence, as in this case, no possible difficulties could be raised from the French, side.Some discussion ensued regarding the establishment of contacts between the two Army Staffs. The conclusion reached was that the British Ministers agreed to the opening of contacts between the two Army Staffs,, through the respective militarjr attaches, for the purpose of determining the arrangements that would have to be made in the event of British forces being sent to France, taking into account the general observations as to the absence of any definite commitment made by British Ministers in opening the discussion.In the course of the general discussion, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN made it clear that two divisions would be the maximum military force which could be sent to France on the outbreak of war, if the Government of the day decided in favour of sending a force. The possibility was not, however, excluded that at a later stage even more divisions might be sent. At the present moment, however, it was only possible to envisage conditions at the outbreak of war and two divisions repre-sented the maximum which&apos; could be sent at that moment.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN enquired whether the French Ministers had any observations to make on the proposed draft telegram to Berlin, of which copies had been communicated to them at the morning meeting (Annex III).M. BONNET said that the French Government had no objection to the first part of the telegram. They would, however, prefer to omit the last sentence of paragraph 3, as they considered it sufficient to refer to the Locarno obligations and thought that any reference to the notes exchanged in April 1936 would be unnecessary. They would also prefer to leave out the last four lines of para-graph 4, which would therefore end at &quot; .... . well known to the German/Italian Government.&apos;&apos;&quot;M. LEGER explained, in connexion with the last sentence of paragraph 3, that the negative reference to the organisation of national defence should be left out because it conveyed an impression which was not in accordance with the facts, since this subject had, in fact, been discussed during the conversations.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN did not anticipate that he would find any difficulty in accepting the proposed alterations, but wished to examine the matter further.LORD HALIFAX said that if agreement was reached he proposed to send off this telegram to Berlin and Rome early on the 29th April, so that the necessary communication might be made to the German and Italian Governments before the final press communique was issued on the termination of the conversations.8. The Purchase, perhaps on a Joint Basis, of Supplies, such as Food-stuffs and Petrol, in Time of War.LORD HALIFAX stated that the French Government had placed us in possession of their general views on this question. Fie understood they had in mind informal talks between the two Governments concerning the following six questions : (1) Oil.(2) Non-ferrous metals.(3) Tonnage (especially tanker tonnage).(4) Textile raw materials.(5) Food-stuffs and fodder.(6) Coal.He understood that the French Government thought there would be advantage in avoiding competition between the two Governments in effecting purchase of the above commodities in time of war and that it would therefore be desirable to make arrangements in advance covering the supply and purchase of these com-modities. If these were in fact the wishes of the French Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government saw no objection in principle to these proposals. So far as the fifth item (food-stuffs and fodder) was concerned, he understood: that con-versations were proceeding satisfactorily. He thought, however, that if con versa-tions were held on the lines desired by the French Government, they had better be
21300informal and should not lead to any precise commitments nor involve any financial outlay. He thought the question should be handled by establishing confidential personal contact between the experts of the two Governments and, in general, the conversations should be pursued on the lines which had already been adopted as regards food-stuffs and fodder. He hoped that such discussions would provide a basis for reaching speedy decisions in the event of war. He had in mind a general enquiry into the position rather than definite commitments of a precise character.M. DALADIER expressed his agreement with Lord Halifax&apos;s views on this question.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN expressed the hope that nothing would be said by either side to their press about the discussion regarding Staff conversations until a formula had been agreed upon at the meeting on the 29th April.A preliminary press communique (Annex IV) was agreed upon for issue to the press at the conclusion of the second meeting.(The meeting adjourned at 4-45 p.m.)THIRD MEETING, APRIL 29, 10-45 a.m. Preliminary.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN had noticed that their efforts to keep the press within bounds had not been entirely successful, and most imaginative accounts of yesterday&apos;s-discussions had appeared in this morning&apos;s press.4. Czechoslovakia.LORD HALIFAX presumed that on both sides there was a full appreciation of the urgent gravity of the question of Czechoslovakia which they were about to consider. He would therefore not occupy time in trying to develop considerations which were present in all their minds. His Majesty&apos;s Government had raised the question of Czechoslovakia on two occasions recently with the French Government, and there was no subject to which they had looked forward more anxiously for a full and frank discussion.His Majesty&apos;s Government were impressed by the danger of the situation which existed1 in Czechoslovakia. This situation had, of course, been greatly affected by what had recently passed in Austria, and the effect of Austrian events had immediately been strongly felt among the German minority in Czechoslovakia. According to information at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the German minority were forming themselves more and more closely into a compact body under the leadership of Herr Henlein. They were clearly in a state of great exaltation, in so far as could be judged from recent manifestations of Sudeteii opinion. Their general outlook was rapidly changing, and their demands were perpetually growing, not he supposed ^without certain contact with Berlin. That seemed to be the present position so far as the Sudeten districts were concerned., On the other side of the frontier German opinion was also in a high state of exaltation, and the momentum generated by events in Austria might well, in certain circumstances, carry the German Government forward to further operations where, obviously, as we knew, the risk of disturbance to the peace of the world would be much greater than in the case of Austria. In these circumstances it might, in our view, require only one serious incident in the Sudeten German country to precipitate very grave events. His Majesty&apos;s Government had in mind, and fully Tinderstood the position of the French Government, bound as they, were by very precise engagements towards Czechoslovakia, His Majesty&apos;s Government had made their position plain in the speech made by the Prime Minister the other day in the House of Commons, in which he frankly stated what we must all realise to be the fact, that in the case of two countries situated as our two countries were, relations between them might have the effect of producing a situation in which the pressure of events was much stronger than any formal pronouncements. His Majesty&apos;s Government/on their side, regarded the future with an anxiety and a concern which was hardly less than that of the French Government. His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore felt and they had no doubt that the French Government would also feel that every step that was possible must be taken to avoid an outbreak which, as things now stood, might
carry with it a very considerable risk for both France and Great Britain. He would not be speaking with the frankness which characterised the relations between the two countries if he did not make it plain that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment regarded the military situation, viewed specifically from the military angle, with considerable disquiet. Not only was the military situation of Czechoslovakia exceedingly weak; His Majesty&apos;s Government could not regard the position of France and Great Britain as very encouraging in the event of a German attack upon Czechoslovakia, in consequence of which France might feel it her duty to take the offensive against Germany, and as a further consequence of which Great Britain might find herself involved in the ensuing war.For their part, Flis Majesty&apos;s Government were ready and, indeed, anxious to lend the fullest support in their power to whatever might make for European peace. They were not, however, able, as the Prime Minister had explained in the House of Commons, to assume fresh military commitments. The Prime Minister had given reasons for this in the House of Commons, and there was also this additional reason : When recent events had occurred in Austria, His Majesty&apos;s Government had instructed their Chiefs of Staff to make a full examination of the Czechoslovak problem from the military point of view. The result of that examination, which he did not think necessary to examine in any detail, was to reveal what an extremely difficult military problem, if viewed from the purely military angle, the defence of Czechoslovakia presented, and the difficulty increased in proportion as Germany proceeded with the refortification of the Rhineland.They also had to bear in mind such deductions as they had been able to draw from their information on the present position in Russia and Poland. As regards Russia, &apos; recent events, such as the execution of many members of the Higher Command of the army, and the general state of internal unrest in that country, made it extremely doubtful whether Russia could be counted upon to make any great contribution, if, indeed, she could make any contribution at all, to the protection of Czechoslovakia if that country were attacked by Germany. The position of Poland was, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, uncertain, and at best it would not be possible to count upon any help being forthcoming from that quarter. His Majestj^s Government had only recently made representations at Warsaw in the sense of exhorting the Polish Government to endeavour to be more helpful in her attitude towards the difficulties of Czechoslovakia. Although he hoped that these representations might have some effect, he did not think it would be such as to alter his general appreciation of the position of Poland in regard to the main issue with which we were concerned.It therefore followed, in the judgment of His Majesty&apos;s Government, if he might be allowed to state the problem quite crudely, that the result of their combined military and political examination of the issues at stake was that, if the German Government decided to take hostile steps against the Czechoslovak State, it would be impossible, in our present military situation, to prevent those steps from achieving immediate success.Regarded purely as a. military proposition, any re-establishment of the Czechoslovak State would have to wait the issue of a war in which we had been victorious. It might be necessary to&apos; wait a long time before &apos;such a conclusion had been reached, and it was perhaps impossible to exclude from our minds the question whether, even at the end of a victorious war, it would in fact be possible to re-establish the Czechoslovak State on its present basis. It therefore seemed to him absolutely essential and necessary for all of them to face this problem in a spirit of complete realism. In these circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded it as essential that both Governments should agree that every effort should be made by Dr. Benes to reach a settlement of the German minority problem in Czechoslovakia in negotiations with representatives of that minority,&quot; and that both His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government should use all their irifluence, preferably jointly, to further such a settlement. He regarded it as essential that such a settlement should be reached in direct negotiations with Herr Henlein&apos;s party.It was difficult to foresee how events would develop, but it seemed to His Majesty&apos;s Government that there should be two elements in the joint action which was proposed : -In the first place, the German Government ought not to be encouraged to think that they could impose any settlement they would on Czechoslovakia by
force or by threat of force. It was for this reason, among others, that the Prime Minister in his speech in the House of Commons on the 24th March spoke about it being well within the bounds of probabilit)^ that other countries, not parties to the original dispute, would ultimately be involved in any war which might issue from it. His Majesty&apos;&amp; Government would anticipate that it might be desirable at some stage for a direct approach to be made to the German Government on that subject and in that sense. It was not, however, in their mind to make any approach to the German Government at the present moment.Secondly, it should be made very clear to the Czechoslovak Government and to Dr. Benes that they must seize this opportunity, which might be the last, to make a supreme effort to reach a settlement on this question. How far distant and how difficult an agreement at the present moment might be was shown by a comparison of the outline of the proposed &apos;&apos; minorities &quot; or &quot; nationalities &apos; statute which the Czechoslovak Government had communicated to London and Paris on the one hand and on the other by the demands formulated in Herr Henlein&apos;s speech at Karlsbad. His Majesty&apos;s Government had not been able to give the proposed statute anything more than a preliminary study, but they doubted very much whether it did in fact go far enough to constitute an adequate basis for the compromise they were seeking.It also seemed of great importance to His Majesty&apos;s Government that, while on our side we should do all we could to prevent Germany thinking that she could act as she wished, and at the same time bring pressure to bear on Dr. Benes with a view to reaching a real settlement of the minority problem, we must also exercise caution to see that we did not put ourselves in the position of being possibly embarrassed at a later stage by the consequences of our taking any responsibility for proposals made by Dr. Benes which we should not be able finally to support and render effective.The British representative at Prague had recently had long conversations with Dr. Benes and the Foreign Minister. It was not necessary to describe at any length or in great detail the course of these conversations, but he would mention that Dr. Benes had made it clear that he had long held the view that it was impossible for Czechoslovakia to remain what he termed a national State. Dr. Benes appeared now to be thinking in terms of a State composed of different nationalities rather than a single State, including certain minorities.Lord Halifax thought it might be possible to build something on such a conception. His Majesty&apos;s Government felt there was certain difficulty in pronouncing upon the intrinsic merits of any scheme which Dr. Benes might produce and might even put before them, but at the same time he doubted whether it would be possible, and it might not even be right, to avoid expressing our views, even if they were purely tentative, on such a scheme. In attempting to formulate our views he would suggest that two tests should be applied : (1) We should be guided by the intrinsic merits of the scheme, and (2) we should face fairly and squarely the disagreeable fact that what he would term the settlement value of the scheme must also be borne in mind.His Majesty&apos;s Government would be grateful and glad to learn the views of the French Government on the points of view he had outlined above. In particular, they were anxious that the French Government should agree with His Majesty&apos;s Government to make a joint or concerted approach to the Czechoslovak Govern-reassessment  at the earliest possible date in some such sense as His Majesty&apos;s Government had indicated. He would like to add that for this very reason he had been concerned to see from a telegram which had come into his hands in the last day or two, that there appeared to be some danger that the negotiations between Dr. Benes and Herr Henlein&apos;s representatives might be suspended until after the municipal and communal elections which take place in Czechoslovakia, that is to says- until next June. In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government it would be in the highest degree unwise to allow-matters to rest where they were for so long a period at the mercy of unforeseen incidents which might arise. He hoped that the French Government would agree on the desirability of bringing pressure to bear on the Czechoslovak Government to continue their efforts to reach a comprehensive settlement with the Sudeten Germans, probably on a much broader basis  than they had hitherto envisaged, and so avoid the very grave dangers which now confronted Europe.
M. DALADIER said that he wished to approach the problem of Czecho-slovakia in the same spirit as the British Ministers, ignoring ideological considerations and with a lively sense of the realities of the situation. He would remind the British Ministers that in the Anglo-French conversations in London in November 1937, M. Delbos, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, had been asked, during his forthcoming visit to Prague, to urge Dr. Benes to agree to further concessions to the German minority. After M. Delbos&apos;s visit the Czechoslovak Government announced certain concessions, and recently they had gone even further in a new plan, which had been communicated to the French Government, and also, he believed, to the British Government. He was of the opinion that Czechoslovakia had done more for the minorities than any other European State. He had himself visited Czechoslovakia several times. He had been to the Sudeten districts and everywhere he had seen German schools and German officials. If, therefore, Czechoslovakia was compared with other countries, it must be recognised that nowhere else had greater concessions been made to minorities. He agreed, however, that both Governments should make an effort to persuade Dr. Benes to go even further in his concessions to the German minority, but he could only agree on certain conditions. He was himself convinced that Herr Henlein was not, in fact, seeking any concessions, and that his real object was the destruction of the present Czechoslovak State. This, he thought, was clear from Herr Henlein&apos;s Karlsbad speech, as it had been reported in the press, whose character was violent and entirely negative. It was interesting to note that Sudeten circles had tried to create the impression that the published text was not accurate and that what Herr Henlein had really said would only be known .in a fortnight. He thought that this clearly indicated the true character of the speech. He repeated that Herr Henlein&apos;s real object was the destruction of the Czechoslovak State. Dr. Benes, however, whose wisdom he would be the first to recognise, had nevertheless indicated that he was ready to continue negotiations. Lord Halifax, for his part, had said that his information indicated that Dr. Benes might be prepared to go much further in the direction of a State of nationalities. If Dr. Benes&apos;s views had been accurately reported, certainly the French Government would not wish to raise any objection to such a policy, and they would support everything which Dr. Benes could do in the hope of pacifying the European situation. But if the French Government were to agree to intervene yet again at Prague with a view to persuading the Czechoslovak Government to make further concessions to their German population, then he thought it was essential to say quite frankly that if such concessions were not accepted, then we should be prepared to support the Czechoslovak Government and prevent the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Otherwise he feared that the proposed demarche in Prague could only be humiliating and even dangerous. He agreed with the British Government that our support for the Czechoslovak Government should, of course, be made dependent upon the latter adopting a reasonable policy, but at the same time it would, in his view, be dangerous to bring pressure to bear upon Dr. Benes, which might well have the effect of disquieting Czechoslovak public opinion, if we were determined not to accept the responsibilities implicit in the action we had taken.M. Daladier considered, however, that it was not really at &quot;Prague that it was necessary to bring pressure to bear. He was convinced that the Czechoslovak Government would take whatever action we indicated to them. The danger, in his view, lay outside Czechoslovakia. The recent Sudeten Congress at Karlsbad and the agitation among Sudeten Germans illustrated only too clearly the dramatic situation of Europe. We should be blind if we did not see the realities of the present situation. We were confronted by German policy readily translated into action, designed to tear up treaties and destroy the equilibrium of Europe. In his view, the ambitions of Napoleon were far inferior to the present aims of the German Reich. One had only to consider recent events, First, there had been the occupation of the Rhineland. On this occasion France had taken no action. He realised that it was not usual to -criticise the action taken by a previous Govern-ment, but he wished to state quite frankly that if he himself had been in power at that time he would have opposed the German occupation of the Rhineland, by force, if necessary. Secondly, there had been the question of Austria. We had. talked a great deal of the necessity of maintaining the independence of Austria, but nothing had been done. He realised that there had been an obvious objection to any action.   The Austrians were of German race, and there had been a move-
ment in favour of the &quot; Anschluss &quot; in Austria, nevertheless prepared by Nazi propaganda. To sum up, the independence of Austria had been destroyed, and all we had done was to offer our condolences. To-day we were faced with the question of Czechoslovakia. To-morrow we might be faced with that of Roumania. King Carol had recently arrested M. Codreanu, chief of the Roumanian Iron Guard, and documents hacLbeett found showing that the action of the Iron Guard had been carefully co-ordinated with the Nazi party in Germany, with a view to introducing a form of Nazi rule in Roumania. He thought it was clear that, if and when Germany had secured the petrol and wheat resources of Roumania, she would then turn against the Western Powers, and it would be our own blindness which would have provided Germany with the very supplies she required for the long war which she admitted she was not now in a position to wage.M. Daladier agreed that every effort should be made to avoid war, but he could only profess his profound conviction that, confronted as we were with such a situation, war could only be avoided if Great Britain and France made their determination quite clear to maintain the peace of Europe by respecting the liberties and the rights of independent peoples. If we were to act accordingly and show that we were ready to take action to save the independence of Czechoslovakia, if need arose after she had made such concessions as we considered necessary to the German minority, then he felt an improvement would take place in the European situation. Only then could we expect to see Yugoslavia, over whose policy Great Britain could exercise great influence, Roumania and perhaps even Poland, change their present attitude and give us their support in the cause of peace. If, however, we were once again to capitulate when faced by another threat, we should then haA^e prepared the way for the very war we wished to avoid.He realised that the British Ministers had raised objections concerning the military situation. They had suggested that we were powerless to act effectively in support bf Czechoslovakia, and that it would, therefore, be useless to make any general declaration. If he felt that this was really the case, that we were in fact powerless to act, then he would agree that the only course was to resign ourselves to the inevitable. But he could not agree to such a proposition. In his view the Czechoslovak army was by no means to be despised. On a peace footing, it numbered 180,000 men, and on mobilisation it could be enlarged to 500,000 men, well trained, well equipped, and animated by a public spirit. He admitted that the Czech fortification system could now be turned as a result of the &quot; Anschluss,&quot; but it should not be impossible for Czechoslovakia so to effect a redistribution of her means of defence as to improve her present situation. If, therefore, we took action in the sense he had suggested, then he felt convinced that Roumania, Yugoslavia, and perhaps even Poland, would change their views on the European situation and reaffirm their old friendships. This would, after all, be in their own interests, since he could not believe that these countries could suppose that Germany would respect their independence once she had achieved her other aims. In his view the military situation was really determined by the political situation, and could be decided by the determination shown by statesmen.Fie felt it would be wrong to believe that Germany was now in a position to meet every kind of military requirement. So far as France was concerned, she had her obligations which were contained in her treaty with Czechoslovakia, to whom she had promised her support. This treaty had been signed, not by a chauvinist, but by M. Aristide Briand, whose whole life-work had been devoted to the pacification of Europe. France regarded this treaty as vital, and considered that it must be respected and executed. This would be done by concentrating against France the main strength of the German army in case of war, and this he considered was a form of assistance which was by no means negligible. He would refer to Russia, since Russia had been mentioned by Lord Halifax. He agreed that Russia must have suffered from the brutal and summary executions which bad taken place in the ranks of the Higher Command of the Army. On the other hand, Russia still possessed the strongest air force in Europe, comprising 5,000 aeroplanes. Her potential war resources were extremely great and could easily be brought into play, since the Russian workers were now organised under the system known as &quot; Stakhanovism,&quot; which had been shown to produce impressive results. He, therefore, believed that if Great Britain and France were now to declare that they would bring pressure to bear on the Czechoslovak Govern-ment with a view to securing reasonable concessions for the German minority, at [17137] e
the same time declaring that they could not permit the destruction of the Czecho-slovak State, then the peace of Europe might be saved.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said he had listened with great attention to M. Daladier&apos;s remarks. This subject was perhaps the most important with which they had to deal. M. Daladier had begun by saying that the Czechoslovak Government had made greater concessions to its minorities,than had any other Government in Europe. He did not himself know enough about the details to express any opinion on this, but he was, of course, prepared to believe that this was in fact the case. He had, however, been told by friends of his who had recently visited Czechoslovakia, that the Czechoslovak Government had promised rather more than they had, in fact, carried out. He had observed that, however violent Herr Henlein&apos;s Karlsbad speech had been, he had not, in fact, demanded the &apos;&apos; Anschluss &apos;&apos; with Germany. He had been told by a friend, who had recently come to see him and who had just spent some time in the Sudeten districts, talking to the villagers and representative local Germans, such as mayors and innkeepers, that all the Sudeten he had met had said definitely that they wanted the &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Germany. If this friend&apos;s impression was correct, then Herr Henlein was not at present putting forward his full demands on the lines which his own followers would seem to desire, and which had no doubt been put into their heads by what they had just seen happening in Austria. He wished M. Daladier to understand quite clearly that he was not in any way attempting to justify the policy or activities of the Sudeten Germans, nor of Germany herself But if we were to understand the position correctly, we must try to imagine how things appear to the other side. We were faced with a practical problem, that of trying to save something of Czechoslovakia, and in particular to save the existence of the Czechoslovak State. We must try to picture to ourselves what was the policy of those who were threatening the independence of Czechoslovakia, if, indeed, they did so intend to threaten it.A large part of what M. Daladier had just said had been founded on his view of German aims and ambitions. Mr. Chamberlain would return to that question presently, but for the moment he preferred to consider the problem he had just stated, that of trying to save the existence of the Czechoslovak State. For this purpose there were two things that had to be borne in mind. In the first place, if his - information was correct, Germany had it in her power to impose upon Czechoslovakia such a degree of economic pressure as would, in fact, be irresistible. If Germany adopted this course, no casus belli would then arise under the terms of the Franco-Czechoslovak treaty, and Germany would be able to accomplish everything she required without moving a single soldier. If this view was correct, we were confronted with a very formidable situation. He would, however, leave that on one side for the moment and go on to consider the proposition put forward by M. Daladier.He understood that M. Daladier contemplated doing everything possible in order to avoid war and that he Avas prepared to go so far as to urge Dr. Benes to make further efforts to meet the reasonable demands of the Sudeten Germans. But M. Daladier had made the reservation that, in his opinion, we could not honourably urge Dr. Benes to accept demands, some of which might well threaten the whole structure of the Czechoslovak State. He understood M. Daladier to have gone on to suggest that, while representations should be made to Dr. Benes with this reservation in mind, a declaration should also be made to the German Government, making it quite clear that there was a point beyond which they could not go with impunity. Mr. Chamberlain would like to say that, so far as representations to Dr. Benes were concerned, he would agree generally with M. Daladier. He thought we could ask Dr. Benes to go as far as he possibly could towards a settlement of the Sudeten question, and thus, avoid putting her allies in a position which, to say the least, must cause them intense anxiety. We would not, in our representations at Prague, press Dr. Benes to accept terms ^ which, in effect, meant the destruction of his country. Mr. Chamberlain would propose to tell Dr. Benes plainly what he could expect from us and what he could not expect. He thought it would be the worst possible service to Dr. Benes at this juncture to lead him to suppose that he could count on greater support from us, in the event of certain circumstances arising, than would, in fact, be the case, and so disappoint him at a later stage. In Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s view we should indicate plainly to Dr. Benes the limits within which he. could count upon us.
If he had understood M. Daladier correctly, the latter was of the opinion that, if, at this juncture, we were to speak to the German Government with sufficient firmness, then there would be no war, for either Germany would not be able or would not care to brave the united forces of France, Great Britain and Czechoslovakia, and such assistance as might be obtainable from outside sources. He considered that this was what the Americans in their card games&apos;called bluff. It amounted to advancing a certain declaration in the hope that that declaration would prevent the events we did not wish to occur. But it was not a certainty that such action would be successful. It might be true that the chances against war were 100-1, but so long as that one chance existed, we must consider carefully what our attitude must be, and how we should be prepared to act in the event of war. He himself had considerable sympathy with the views which M. Daladier had expressed, and he had even asked himself where the present course of events was likely to stop. He had considered whether there must not be some moment at which it was necessary to put down one&apos;s foot and take all risks to prevent-a further deterioration in the situation. With the problem of Czechoslovakia especially in his mind, he had thought long and anxiously whether we could make the sort of declaration which M. Daladier had in mind. But when he had examined the military situation, he had been assailed by serious doubts. If a war arose after such a declaration, he himself could not see any possibility of saving Czechoslovakia, of avoiding the destruction of that country, or of its being overrun by the aggressor. The Czech army was no doubt a good one, as M. Daladier had indicated, but the latter had admitted that Czechoslovakia^ fortifications had been turned as a result of the &quot; Anschluss.&quot; One had only to look at the map. Czechoslovakia was surrounded by German territory on three sides. He could not help thinking of the extreme rapidity and the efficient organisation with which 3,000 armed men had been landed by Germany near Vienna in half an hour. In such circumstances, how would it be possible to save Czechoslovakia ? In such a situation, were we to say to Germany that we would not tolerate her continued progress in Europe and that the moment had come to call a halt; and that, if Germany were to take certain steps, we would then declare war ? We would then be casting the die and deciding that, in our view, this was, from the military point of view,- the opportune moment to declare war on Germany with the object of bringing about her defeat. When listening to M. Daladier, he had himself felt corresponding emotions. It made his blood boil to see Germany getting away with it time after time and increasing her domination over free peoples. But such sentimental considerations were dangerous, and&apos; he must remember, as M. Daladier would also have to remember, the forces with which we were playing. Whatever the odds might be in favour of peace or war, it was not money but men with which we were gambling, and he could not lightly enter into a conflict which might mean such frightful results for innumerable families, men, women and children, of our own race. We must therefore consider with the greatest care whether, if the attitude he had just outlined towards Germany were adopted, we and in this connexion he was thinking of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government, since we could not count on any outside support were sufficiently powerful to make victory certain. Frankly, he did not think we were.&apos; He fully agreed with the remarks which M. Daladier had made yesterday on the power of the defensive, and he thought that a time would come when a gamble on the issue of peace or war might be contemplated with less anxiety than at present. At this moment he was certain public opinion in Great Britain would not allow His Majesty&apos;s Government to take such a risk, and it was no use for this Government, or indeed for any other Government, to go beyond its public opinion with the possible effect of bringing destruction to brave people. Great though his sympathy was for the views expressed by M. Dadalier, his cool judgment told him that the moment had not come when it was safe to adopt such an attitude.Mr. Chamberlain had asked himself whether the picture was really so black as M. Daladier had painted it. For * his part he doubted very much whether Herr Hitler really desired, to destroy the Czechoslovak State or rather a Czecho-slovak State. He doubted whether at the present moment he wished to bring about the &apos;&apos; Anschluss &apos;&apos; of the Sudeten districts with Germany, and he thought that the reason why Herr Henlein had not in his speech demanded this &quot; Anschluss,&quot; which was desired by his own followers, was that he had received advice from Berlin not to do so.  He agreed,&quot;however, that this might only mean.[17137] ^ e 2
a temporary suspension, and that a demand for the &quot; Anschluss &quot; might reappear in the future. He thought, however, that it should be possible for Dr. Benes to put forward such proposals which, although they would alter the character of the Czechoslovak State, as we had known it hitherto, would not bring about its destruction. I  Germany did decide to destroy Czechoslovakia, he did not see how this could be prevented. But, for his part, he did not believe that such a decision had been reached.Mr. Chamberlain agreed that meanwhile we must watch very carefully what was going on in other States bordering upon Czechoslovakia; in particular, Roumania, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Poland. He suggested the wisdom of trying to put oneself into the skin of one&apos;s opponent, and he wondered if we need necessarily read into what M. Daladier had said about the discovery of German intrigues in Roumania a definite determination on the part of Germany to obtain control in that country. He would suggest that this might merely represent preparations against the encirclement which Germany undoubtedly thought she had to guard against and against which she required to take every possible precaution. His Majesty&apos;s Government had had to take into account similar considerations before embarking upon their conversations with the Italian Government. There had been certain hostile Italian activities, of which His Majesty&apos;s Government were very well aware, but they considered that these activities might well be the Italian response to suspicions regarding the future intentions of Great Britain, rather than a definite indication of- aggressive intentions on the part of Italy towards Great Britain and British interests. He&apos; claimed that the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government had been justified by the &apos; results of the conversations. He agreed that it was Germany and not Italy which now. had to be considered, but in this case, also, he thought that a less menacing interpretation might be placed upon the facts than that which M. Daladier had suggested. He thought it important not to forget the great improvement which had taken place in the relations between Great Britain and Italy, and if we played our cards carefully and wisely he thought we might still do a great deal to keep the States of Central Europe and the Balkans out of the German orbit . and to exercise the deterrent influence on Germany which we all considered to be necessary.In conclusion, Mr. Chamberlain had never excluded the possibility, for no one in his position could do so, that at some time we might be compelled to go to war. Circumstances might arise in which things more precious would be at stake than wealth, or life, or property; but he could only agree to go to war in the very last resort and could not envisage such a possibility as something to be undertaken lightly. He had himself seen war and had seen how impossible it was for anyone engaging in any war like the last war to come out of it stronger or happier. Therefore only dire necessity would ever persuade him to wage a preventive war. He was against preventive-war. But however dangerous the present situation might be, he did not think that we should lose heart or regard it as^ impossible to improve the situation in the next few years without running the frightful risks of the course which M. Daladier had urged should be adopted.M. BONNET, without wishing to reply to Mr. Chamberlain, wished to return to the consideration of immediate realities. He thought that very soon, in the weeks ahead of us, perhaps within the next month, we might probably be faced with the Czechoslovak problem as a result of an act of force on the part of Germany. The telegrams which the Quai d&apos;Orsay had received from Berlin were not in entire agreement with the views expressed by Mr. Chamberlain. On the contrary, there were indications of a strong tendency on the part of such prominent German leaders as Herr Hess, Field-Marshal Goring and Dr. Goebbels, not to wait any longer to profit from the present situation and what they uegarded as the weakness of the Western Powers, and to confront the Czechoslovak Government with conditions similar to those which had preceded the disappearance of Austria. It was not, therefore, correct to say that Herr Hitler and his immediate entourage favoured the conversation of a Czecho-slovakia transformed into a neutral State on a federal basis. This might be the view of the German Foreign Office, but it was certainly not the view held by those close to the Fiihrer. They had noted the success wuth which the swift use of force had met in the occupation of the Rhineland and in Austria. In their view it was simply a question of removing Czechoslovakia from the map of Europe: the German parts of Bohemia would go to the Reich and Teschen to
Poland. Slovakia would be attached to Hungary with some degree of autonomy. The Czechs would constitute a small State which would necessarily be in the German orbit. He must repeat that he thought we should be confronted with some such situation in the near future. It would be dangerous not to reflect on this situation in advance, before a further violation of treaties on the part of Germany. ^ ,On this hypothesis what line would the French Government adopt? M. Daladier had explained that France would scrupulously respect her obliga-tions, which were contained in the 1935 treaty. France must respect her signature and Great Britain, whose school-children were taught the importance of honouring their promises, would readily understand the attitude of France.Lord Halifax had asked earlier in the conversations how efficacious were the measures which the French Government could take to oppose German action. Obviously their efficacity would be partly dependent upon the support which might be forthcoming from His Majesty&apos;s Government. If France remained alone, the situation must be uncertain; but if solidarity existed between France and Great Britain they could ensure the success of their views. On any hypothesis such solidarity between the two Governments should be reached in advance. Mr. Chamberlain had explained with impressive arguments the difficulties of defend-ing Czechoslovakia. But the problem would remain the same. After we had made our demarche in Prague and after the Czechoslovak Government had agreed to make further concessions, if these were rejected and even at this stage there were no solidarity between the French and British Governments in support of Czechoslovakia, then he was convinced that Germany would be in.a position to remove. Czechoslovakia from the map of Europe, which was obviously a solution she would prefer to the half-way solution which had been mentioned, and which Germany would have to accept if the views of the French Government and the British Government were completely at one. Therefore, a joint firm attitude, accompanied by the determination not to depart from such an attitude in any circumstances, seemed absolutely necessary under any hypothesis, whether on the French hypothesis that France was compelled to respect her obligations and honour her signature, or on the British hypothesis regarding the probable course of events which Mr. Chamberlain had explained. His view was that we could only succeed if we agreed in advance upon our policy in the face of German intentions, which were publicly announced to every traveller who passed through that country.(M. Bonnet left the meeting at 12-30 p.m.)LORD HALIFAX, in reply to M. Bonnefs observations, was sure that the British Government agreed with the sentiments expressed by M. Bonnet, as to the importance of obtaining, so far as this was possible, such a close understanding of each other&apos;s minds as would enable us to act in future with the greatest possible degree of solidarity between us. As he saw it, the great difference between the two points of view was this : M. Daladier had said, and M. Bonnet had suggested the same thing, that the military situation was dependent upon the political situation. On the British side, the problem was viewed from another angle, and the political situation was considered to be dependent upon the military situation. The British Ministers were disposed to the view that diplomatic efforts were most likely to be useful, and that it would be necessary to rely particularly upon these. It would not be safe to rely on the use of force, as Mr. Chamberlain had explained. It would represent a gamble, and he thought Mr. Chamberlain had been abundantly right when he said that this was a course which he thought this country would find herself unable to adopt.If at this stage we agreed together to make the fullest use of diplomatic means, he thought it would certainly be desirable and, , indeed, in his view essential, for the two Governments to join in making the strongest possible representations to the Czechoslovak Government. He would suggest that both the French Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government should now consider whether, if a point were reached at which private information was received from Dr. Benes that he might be prepared to consider such and such a solution which would go a long way to remove the dangers of the present situation, it might not then be possible to approach the German Government through diplomatic channels, and say to them that it had occurred to us that it might be possible to arrive at an agreement on the Sudeten question on the lines of such and such a
formula as suggested by Dr. Benes. If the German Government would agree, this would then be a basis on which His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government could bring pressure to bear on the Czechoslovak Government to accept such a solution. He was not certain whether it would, in fact, be prudent to act on such lines, but he thought the course he had suggested merited consideration. ^ ,There was, of course, a great deal that we could do in various directions with regard to the countries in Central Europe and the Balkans bordering upon Czechoslovakia. His Majesty&apos;s Government already had this question in mind, and they would not be slow to seize any opportunity offered to encourage the feelings of considerable anxiety in these countries which, according to their information, had been generated by recent events in Austria, and to reinforce their desire to find means to strengthen themselves in view of those, very events; He thought it should be possible for our two countries, not necessarily acting on the same lines since the ways in which they might help necessarily varied, to contribute to stabilising the scales in those parts of Europe.M. DALADIER fully understood and, in fact, shared the sentiments expressed by Mr. Chamberlain in condemning war. For his part, he was convinced that we ought all to endeavour to avoid war, which we condemned as something monstrous. He had gone through the last war for four years as a combatant, and had served as an infantryman from the Somme to Alsace. He had seen the destruction of the ten richest provinces of his country. He had seen his best friends killed around him, and after such an experience one&apos;s only thought could be to do everything possible to avoid a repetition of such atrocities. Consequently, he could not allow it to be supposed that he was in favour of a preventive war, the very idea of which he regarded as criminal.. But he was in a position in which he had to meet obligations which were of a purely defensive character, and respect the terms of a treaty which menaced no one, and which only protected an independent people against unprovoked aggression. This was the situation as regards Czechoslovakia, and the relations between France and Czechoslovakia. The problem was how to avoid war. He could not help thinking that if the common policy of France and Great Britain was inspired by sentiments of weakness, if we submitted on every occasion before violent measures and the use of force, the only result would be to precipitate renewed violence and ensure further success for the use of forceful methods. If, on the other hand, our general policy, however wise and pacific, were also inspired by firmness, and this were generally known and appreciated, then he thought a European war might be avoided. Otherwise we should only be advancing towards the troubles we feared. He thought that the policy we had advocated could only have fortunate results throughout Europe, and especially at Berlin. Mr. Chamberlain had suggested that this was a policy of bluff. M. Daladier did not intend any bluff. German policy, on the other hand, was one of bluff, or had certainly been so in the past. When Herr Hitler had ordered the reoccupation of the Rhineland, this policy had been opposed by the German Higher Command, who feared its possible consequences. He had himself been informed by two German generals that they had given their advice against this operation, but Herr Hitler had bluffed and had reoccupied the Rhineland. He had used this method and had succeeded. Was there any reason why he should cease to use such methods if we left him an open road and so ensured his success ? As regards the suggestion of encirclement, he did not himself believe that Germany was really worried about encirclement. After all, who was encircling Germany? In the west she had reoccupied the Rhineland. She had recently occupied Austria. She had forged the Rome-Berlin axis and established satisfactory relations with Poland. She was now considering the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia, and if she succeeded in this, she would then set about realising the dream of William II of a Mitteleuropa under German dominance. Where was there any question of encirclement in this ? He could only see in all this a very disturbing manifestation of the dynamic force of modern Germany. We were at present still able to place obstacles in her path, but if we failed to do so now, we should then, in his view, make a European war inevitable in the near future, and he was afraid that we should certainly not win such a war, for once Germany had at her disposal all the resources of Central and Eastern Europe, how could any effective military resistance be opposed to her? In such conditions the German Empire would be inevitably stronger than that of Napoleon.
It had been suggested that efforts should be made to induce the Government at Prague to make further concessions to the Sudeten Germans. He agreed to such a course, but if the result of such representations would only be that after such concessions had been offered the road would be open to Germany, who would be given a free hand to act as she wished, then we should only have precipitated a catastrophe instead of preventing it. He regretted that he must say that the French Government could not agree that German policy should be allowed to continue to develop freely. It was his belief that, if no warning were given to the effect that justice and the public law of Europe must be respected and German policy continued to develop on its present lines, we should soon be faced with even greater dangers. He feared that time was not on our side, but rather against us, if we allowed Germany to achieve a new success every month or every quarter, increasing her material strength and her political influence with every successful advance. If this continued, countries which were now hesitating would feel compelled to submit to the hegemony of Germany and then, as we had been warned in Mein Kampf, Germany would turn to the west. He feared that, if the opposite thesis to that which he had summarised was approved, if there were no signs of a determined policy and a common agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government, we should then have decided the fate of Europe, and he could only regard the future with the greatest pessimism.(The meeting was adjourned at 1 p.m.)FOURTH MEETING, April 29, 2-45 p.m.7. Staff Conversations (continued).Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that before returning to the subject under discussion at the morning&apos;s meeting, there was one matter which he would like to mention. He had had an opportunity during luncheon of exchanging a few words with M. Daladier regarding naval conversations. He had gathered that his French friends attached more importance to this question than he had hitherto appreciated. He had already explained that any objections on his part were based on expediency, and not on principle, and if the present position/was that the French Ministers would find it more agreeable to arrive at some more positive conclusion than had been agreed at yesterday&apos;s meeting, he would be prepared to accept what M. Bonnet had proposed, namely, that both Governments were agreed in principle to naval conversations being held, but that these should only be taken up as soon as opportunity offered. For example, he would suggest after Herr Hitler&apos;s visit to Rome.M. DALADIER expressed himself in agreement with this suggestion, which corresponded with the views of the French Ministers.44. Czechoslovakia (continued).LORD HALIFAX said that both sides had had an opportunity of considering further what had passed at this morning5s meeting. He thought that a good deal of what had been said, both by M. Bonnet towards the end of the morning&apos;s meeting and by M. Daladier at an earlier stage, did involve the suggestion that at some point or other His Majesty5s Government should combine any advice which, in conjunction with the French Government, they might give to Dr. Benes, with a guarantee to Dr. Benes that if he accepted our advice and acted upon tit, he could then count upon full British support if the German Government rejected his proposals and Czechoslovakia were a victim of German aggression. He was fully sensible of the force of what M. Daladier had said in the morning regarding the importance of doing everything we could to check Germany in her process of absorption, and to prevent the establishment of a German hegemony in Europe as a result of the absorption of one unit after another. He fully realised the exact implications of what M. Daladier had said, but he could only remind him that for the reasons already given by Mr. Chamberlain it was impossible for His Majesty5s Government to contemplate
going any further in the way of commitments than had been indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s speech in the House of Commons on the 24th March. A further consideration which had not been mentioned, but which would no doubt be present in the minds of the French Ministers, was that whatever might be the attitude of this country and it was at present as the Prime Minister had described it  His Majesty&apos;s Government also had to take into account the attitude of the Dominions on a question of this kind in which they might well become involved as a consequence of whatever decision was taken now. He could, therefore only repeat the statement made by Mr. Chamberlain at the morning meeting regarding the impossibility of making any further commitments.This being the case, they had been asking themselves what further help they were in a position to give with a view to relieving the common anxieties felt by the French Government and also by His Majesty&apos;s Government. From their point of view they had re-examined the possibility)&apos;-, which had already been suggested, of making some approach both to Prague.and also to Berlin. When discussing at the morning session the question of approaching Prague, M. Daladier had said, very properly, that it was not only a question of Prague, and that it was not less important also to take steps elsewhere. It was therefore for consideration whether a useful purpose might be served if we also made an approach to Berlin, and what character such an approach should take if it were decided upon. It was possible that the German Government might take the line that the Sudeten question was their concern and not the concern of His Majesty&apos;s Government or of the French Government. We should, however, then be able to reply that Field-Marshal Goring had given His Majesty&apos;s Government certain assurances in respect of Czechoslovakia after the German absorption of Austria. Although it was true that Great Britain was not directly interested in the lot of the Sudeten Germans, she was closely interested in the peace of Europe, and it could be pointed out to the German Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government had made it plain to them that if the problems of Czechoslovakia were handled unwisely, this might lead to a European war.The British Ministers had been wondering whether it would be wise.to make an approach to Berlin in some such sense; and, if it were considered wise to act on these lines, which of two alternative courses should be adopted. The first alternative would be to approach Dr. Benes in the first place, and find out from him the utmost concessions which he was prepared to make. An approach could then be made to Berlin, in which His Majesty&apos;s Government would inform the German Government of the measures which they thought Dr. Benes might be willing to take if he were satisfied that on such lines a settlement could be reached which might be expected to endure. They would then be able to judge from the reactions to this approach what were the real. intentions of Germany. Alternatively, it might be considered better to approach Berlin in the first place and say to the German Government that they had on many occasions represented that the treatment of the Sudeten Germans by the Czechoslovak Government was a matter of the gravest anxiety for them. We could say that we were also concerned over this problem in so far as we wished to see it handled in such a way as would not involve, the possibility of war. We could ask the German. Government to suggest what they considered to be the best means of relieving these anxieties, and of remedying what they alleged to be maltreatment of their people in Czechoslovakia. He had a feeling that German claims were rather like mushrooms, in that they grew in the dark, and if we could succeed in bringing them into the open, though there might be dangers and disadvantages in so doing, we should at least know where we were; and we should know what claims were really being made, and be on firmer ground on which to decide what action should be taken. If some such methods were considered useful, His Majesty&apos;s Government might go on to suggest to the German Government that they should look at the position in the following light. It was possible that if His Majesty&apos;s Government could persuade Dr. Benes to move so far in the direction of further concessions, the German Government might obtain 60 per cent or 70 per cent, of their complete demands by pacific methods. If, however, they rejected such a compromise and insisted on the full 100 per cent, of their demands, then there was the gravest risk that they could only achieve their object by war, and in that event the position of the British Government had been quite clearly defined for all to read by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons ou the 24th March.  He felt that something on the above lines offered
the best solution, and, in fact, the only compromise between M. Daladier&apos;s very natural request for a firm British commitment, which it was, however, quite impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to give, and the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government having regard to public opinion in this country and in other parts of the Empire. ,M. BONNET said that there was one question he wished to ask. If we accepted as a hypothesis that such a demarche were made in Prague and that the Czechoslovak Government agreed to offer further concessions, at that moment and under those particular circumstances would the British Government then be prepared, to affirm its solidarity with the French Government with a view to the maintenance of a settlement on the lines agreed upon with Dr. Benes \ He felt it was essential that when such a point had been reached we should no longer remain in the present state of uncertainty.LORD HALIFAX said that, if he had rightly understood M. Bonnet, the latter had asked whether, after Dr. Benes had informed His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment of the concessions which he was prepared to make, and the latter had found them reasonable, His Majesty&apos;s Government would then be prepared, in the event of the rejection of these concessions by Germany and of a German attack on Czechoslovakia, to accept an obligation to defend Czechoslovakia against the results of such German aggression. If this was M. Bonnefs question, he could only answer that, for the reasons already given, it would be impossible to accept such a commitment.He thought, however, that it was perhaps worth mentioning at this stage that in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government it would be going a long way if, as he had suggested, we were to repeat direct to Herr Hitler the words which Mr. Chamberlain had already pronounced in the House of Commons regarding the attitude of this country in certain eventualities. He felt there was a great difference between repeating such words direct to the German Government and so giving it a particular application, and pronouncing them in the House of Commons primarily for our own people, even if the German Government naturally knew of them.M. DALADIER wished to recall exactly what the position of the French Government was, and to make certain concrete proposals. They considered that solidarity should be established between France and Great Britain and any other countries which were ready to join them, and we should then pursue a policy aimed at reconciliation in Czechoslovakia. It was, of course, legitimate -as the Prime Minister and Lord Halifax had suggested first to inform ourselves and find out how far Dr. Benes&apos;s proposals were calculated to bring about a degree of appeasement desired on both sides in Czechoslovakia. If, however, the Czecho-slovak Government were ready to make concessions on a reasonable scale, then he felt it was essential, as a minimum, to obtain assurances from Berlin that Germany would not resort to arms with a view to solving this question. She might be reminded of Field-Marshal Goring&apos;s assurances to the British Ambassador in Berlin that Germany had no intention of resorting to force in this connexion. He did not think there was anything in such an&apos; approach of a nature to arouse German susceptibilities. But it should be clearly realised that if, after such demarches had been made at Berlin and Prague, and in spite of the assurances given by Field-Marshal Goring, which he would probably be prepared to renew, Germany nevertheless resorted to force to settle the Sudeten question, then the British and French Governments would have to draw the obvious conclusions.&quot; He had framed concrete suggestions on these lines with a view, as Lord Halifax had suggested, to preventing. the German mushroom growing too rapidly. There was nothing in what he had suggested to offend any Government, particularly the German Government, if their policy was loyal and sincere and they really wished to maintain the peace of Europe. He suggested that it might be possible to agree on action on these lines, and he added that the suggestions already put forward by Lord Halifax were in many respects calculated to -give satisfaction to the French Government.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN realised that there was naturally some difficulty in reaching agreement on this question, but he was not quite clear as to the precise form of the demarche suggested by M. Daladier.   If he had understood him aright, he had seemed to commit both the British and French Governments to a &apos;[17137] f
particular Czechoslovak plan of concessions which might not prove acceptable to the German Government. If we were then to ask the German Government for an assurance that they would not resort to force, it was doubtful whether we should get such an assurance in the form we required. Supposing, however, that the German Government did, for the time being, accept the Czechoslovak proposals, although they did not think that they were in every way satisfactory, it would be only too easy for them at a later stage to stir up disturbances in the Sudeten areas and then intervene, saying, as they had done in the case of Austria, that they had no intention of using force, but had been compelled to take action in order to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. He was thei-efore a little uncomfortable of accepting M. Daladier&apos;s proposal at this stage without trying to obtain first from Germany some indication of what the German Government would be prepared to accept. If therefore an approach to the German Government by His Majesty&apos;s Government was desired by the French Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government would prefer to make such an approach simultaneously with their representations at Prague. His Majesty&apos;s Government would then be in a position to say that they, for their part, were doing their best to bring about a peaceful solution by representing to Dr. Benes the necessity of his contributing to such a solution. The British Government could then add that it took two to reach an agreement and ask the German Government what their position was. We would be able to suggest to them that, in view of the representations we had made in Prague, there was no need for Germany to take any hasty action, and we should then try to ascertain from the German Government what was their idea of a peaceful settlement. The answer of the German Government might be that they required what Herr Henlein had demanded in his Karlsbad speech. We might then suggest that in our view certain of these demands might be obtained, but that we regarded other demands as being unreasonable. If then the German Government refused to move from their position, His Majesty&apos;s Government could then say that they had done their best, and if, in spite of the representations they had made to the German Government, the latter nevertheless insisted in having recourse to force, they must realise what the dangers were. It must be clear to them that the French Government were bound by their treaty obligations to support Czechoslovakia, and the German Government must realise that His Majesty&apos;s Government had not said that they would risks^come in, too. At this point a communication would be made to the German Government on the lines of the speech he had made in the House of Commons on the 24th March, 1938. He would like to know whether his French friends would regard the course of action he had just outlined as a possible line of approach. M. Daladier said he would like to examine this suggestion rather more closely with his colleagues of the French delegation, but at first sight it seemed to him to mark a rapprochement between the British and French views. It was clear to him that there was no difference of view as regards our general ideas and the objects we both had in mind. The differences had only arisen in regard to the means by which these objects could be achieved. These differences mainly arose from the difference in the circumstances of the two countries.(The meeting was then adjourned for a few minutes.)On the resumption of the conversations, M. BONNET said that, in order to avoid confusion, he had recapitulated in a short note his understanding of the proposals which the Prime Minister had put forward.The conclusion reached, after some discussion, was that both Governments were agreed that there should be a demarche by His Majesty&apos;s Government alone - in Berlin. They would explain to the G erman Government that they were doing their best to find a peaceful solution of the Sudeten difficulty and had asked Dr. Benes to make his contribution, but it took two to reach an agreement, and. they therefore wished to know what was the position of the German Government. They wished to impress on the German Government that, in the meantime, and in view of their intervention at Prague, there was no need, nor indeed any reason, for action on the part bf the German Government. Simultaneously, a demarche would be made at Prague by both the French and the British Govern-ments to secure the maximum concessions from Dr. Benes. If, however, a peaceful solution were not reached by this means, His Majesty&apos;s Government would then say to the German Government that they had done everything the;-could; if, in spite of this, the German Government intended to resort to forcfe
they would be doing so in full knowledge of the dangers of which they were aware, namely, that France would be compelled to intervene by virtue of her obliga-tions, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not guarantee that they would not do the-same. In this connexion His Majesty&apos;s Government would make use of the phrases used by Mr. Chamberlain in his speech in the House, of Commons on the 24th March, 1938.5. The Problem of Central Europe, with special reference to the possibility- of economic assistance to czechoslovakia, roumania and Yugoslavia.M. DALADIER said he had already informed Mr. Chamberlain that, so far as Czechoslovakia was concerned, the French Government were prepared to grant her the important economic advantages which they had previously granted to Austria as regards the system of exports and the exchange of goods. So far as Roumania and Yugoslavia were concerned, and these considerations would apply also to Czechoslovakia, he considered that it was certainly the case that if the Western Powers could give any assistance of an economic nature this would help towards European appeasement. These questions, however, were very complex and difficult, and if they were to be examined properly, it would be necessary to go into great detail. He would therefore suggest that this meeting should agree upon the principle of according such assistance as might be possible, but should confide to experts, appointed by the two Governments, the task of recommending what practical steps could be taken to grant economic assistance to these Central European States.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that this question had been examined on the British side, and their examination had shown that there were very great difficulties in the way, into which he need not, however, enter at this meeting. He agreed that both the French and British Governments should do all they could to increase their trade with the countries of Central and South-Eastern Europe. He was therefore prepared to fall in with M. Daladier&apos;s proposal that this matter should be further discussed in detail by experts, by whom he supposed the commercial attaches were meant.THE FRENCH MINISTERS agreed.6. Anglo-German Relations.LORD HALIFAX said he would not have a great deal to say on this question. The French Government were aware how matters stood up to the time of the interview between the British Ambassador in Berlin and Herr Hitler on the 3rd March, 1938. At that interview, as we had already informed the French Government, we had instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to take soundings from Herr Hitler on the colonial question. Herr Hitler had promised to send a written answer in due course, and we were -awaiting that answer. Meanwhile, Sir N. Henderson had been instructed that he should not himself reopen conversations at present, and there seemed, indeed, to be very little scope at present for reopening them. But he had said to Sir N. Henderson that he did not wish the door to be closed in case opportunity offered, and we could take advantage of the door being still open. At to-day&apos;s conversations they had envisaged one particular direction in which His Majesty&apos;s Government might have to enter into discussions with the German Government. If discussions went well in this connexion they might well be made more general in character with a view to arriving at a detente. In that case we should, of course, inform the French Government of the position and secure their assent to whatever we considered it would be wise to do so in such circumstances. But for the moment he had nothing concrete to propose.THE FRENCH MINISTERS declared themselves in agreement.9. Swiss Neutrality.. LORD HALIFAX said that in order to facilitate the consideration of this item on the agenda he had drawn up a tentative draft of a resolution to be [17137] f 2?
placed before the Council of the League of Nations on the question of Swiss neutrality (Annex V). He suggested that this might be translated and he would then appreciate the views of the French Ministers&apos;. The French Ministers, after hearing a translation of the draft resolution, concurred in it.LORD HAEIFAX wished, however, to draw their attention to two points which he hoped M. Bonnet would bear in mind when he went to Geneva for the meeting of the Council. On p. 3 of the draft resolution the unique position of Switzerland had been specially emphasised to avoid the danger of this action in respeci of Switzerland becoming a bad example for other countries. Again, he feared that the concluding passage of the penultimate paragraph of the draft resolution : &quot; On the understanding that Switzerland will not, by reason of her special position, seek to place obstacles in the way of collective measures which the members of the League may in the future agree to take in pursuance of their obligations under the Covenant&apos;&apos; might not be entirely agreeable to the Swiss Government. He hoped that in the.event of objections being raised by the Swiss Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government could rely upon the help of the French Government in disposing of such objections.The FRENCH MINISTERS agreed.10. The Far East.LORD HALIFAX said there was only one point he&apos;wished to raise in regard to the Far East. This was a matter arising from the presence of certain Japanese on an island, of which he had only recently heard the name, and as to the geographical position of which he was very vague. It was, however, somewhere in the middle of the South China seas, and he understood that the French Govern-ment claimed partial sovereignty over this island. His Majesty&apos;s Government were considering proposing to the French Government certain measures which might be taken for the protection of our joint interests. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would shortly be approaching the French Government in this connexion, and he hoped that the French Ministers would personally interest themselves in this question when it was laid before them.The FRENCH MINISTERS agreed.Miscellaneous.LORD HALIFAX said that he would like to remind M. Bonnet, if he might, of two questions which he had already discussed privately with him.(1) He would be very glad if M. Bonnet could move his colleague in the French Government, who was concerned with this question, to assist in curbing the somewhat sinister activities of the Grand Mufti at Beirut. He would not, however, dwell further upon this point.(2) He would also be glad if M. Bonnet could move his colleague in the - French Government, to give the most favourable- consideration to proposals for permitting the settlement of Jews in Madagascar. The Jewish problem was becoming increasingly acute, and His Majesty&apos;s Government were for their part doing their best to assist in any way possible.M. BONNET said that as regards the Grand Mufti, he would certainly comply with Lord Halifax&apos;s request, and as regards the question of Jewish settlement in Madagascar, he would prefer this question to be dealt with through the diplomatic channel.v7. Staff Conversations (continued).LORD HALIFAX said that the French Ministers would remember that he had communicated to them at the first day&apos;s meeting a copy of a telegram (Annex III) which he had intended to send to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors in Berlin and Rome instructing them to make a communication to the German and Italian Governments on the question of staff conversations. He had thought this question over again, and he understood that some doubts had been expressed -^formally on the French side regarding the expediency of such action.    He.
37308had been impressed by this view, and he had decided not to send the proposed telegram, to Berlin or Rome. He thought it would be easier if, in the normal way of business, he asked the Italian Ambassador and the German Charge d&apos;Affaires to call at the Foreign Office to inform him that, in view of certain wild reports which had appeared in the press, he would like to say that, so far as staff conversations were concerned, it had been agreed to continue these txmversa-tions on the same basis as had been laid down in the agreement of March 1936. He would add that there need therefore be no cause for anxiety.THE FRENCH MINISTERS expressed their agreement.Communique.The French and British Ministers agreed on the terms of the final communique to be issued to the press (Annex VI).The proceedings were then closed at 4-45 p.m.

The Far East.ANNEX II.Draft Resolution.rru /-si       ....The Council,NOTING that many members of the League recognise that the Italian Government exercise sovereignty over Ethiopia or have taken action implying such recognition, but that other members of the League have not done so,Is of opinion that the position in regard to this matter should now be clarified.And considers that the obligations of the members of the League as such in connexion with the Italo-Ethiopian dispute do not prevent them from regarding the question of the recognition of Italy&apos;s position in relation to Ethiopia as one for each member of the League to decide for itself in the light of its own situation and obligations.ANNEX III.Draft Telegram.Lord Halifax to His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Berlin and Rome.(No.      .) April    , 1938.YOU should make immediately ah oral communication in the following sense to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.In the conversations now proceeding with French Ministers, we have decided to arrange with- the French Government for contacts between Air Staffs. These contacts will be a continuation of those established after the reoccupation of the Rhineland, as laid down and published in the Text of Proposals of the 19th March, 1936.On that occasion they were defined as being directed towards making further arrangements as regards the technical conditions in which our Locarno obliga-tions should be carried out in case of unprovoked aggression. It was further laid down in the Notes exchanged and published on the 1st April, 1936, that they could not give rise to any political undertaking nor to any obligations regarding the organisation of national defence.We are anxious that the German (Italian) Government should not misunder-stand the character and object of the present decision^ and His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, wish to take this early opportunity of informing the German (Italian) Government that it does not represent any fresh departure or involve any new commitment on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is merely&apos; the continuance of an arrangement already well-known to the german. 2.3. 4. 5.6. 7.8.9. 10.
(Italian) Government, and there is no intention to extend the scope of the contacts contemplated beyond the limits laid down and published in March and April 1936.A similar communication is being made to the Italian (German) Government. (Repeated to Paris,) - &apos;ANNEX IV.First Press Communique.THE French Ministers, M. Daladier and M. Bonnet, who were accompanied by M. Corbin, the French Ambassador, met the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State this morning at No. 10 Downing Street at 10-30 a.m., and the conversa-tions proceeded, with the usual break for lunch, until 4-45 p.m.Full agreement was reached on all the points discussed, and the meeting will be resumed to-morrow morning at 10-30 a.m.ANNEX V.Swiss Neutrality. Tentative Draft of a Council Resolution.IN the Declaration of London of the 13th February, 1920, the Council of the League of Nations, while affirming that the conception of neutrality of the members of the League is incompatible with the principle that all members will be obliged to co-operate in enforcing respect for their engagements, recognised that Switzerland was in a unique situation, based on a tradition of several centuries, which has been explicitly incorporated in the law of nations; and that the members of the League of Nations, signatories of the Treaty of Versailles, have rightly recognised by article 435 that the guarantees stipulated in favour of Switzerland by the treaties of 1815 and especially by the Act of the 20th November, 1815, constitute international obligations for the maintenance of peace.The Council accepted the declaration made on behalf of the Swiss Govern-ment, by which Switzerland recognised and proclaimed the duties of solidarity which membership of the League of Nations imposed upon her, including therein &apos;&apos; the duty of co-operating in such economic and financial measures as may be demanded by the League of Nations against a Covenant-breaking State.&quot; Switzerland was further prepared to make every sacrifice to defend her own territory under every circumstance, even during operations undertaken by the League of Nations, but would not be obliged to take part in any military action, or to allow the passage of any foreign troops or the preparation of military operations within her territory.The Council has now taken note of the memorandum presented on the May by the Swiss Government, in which they ask that the position of Switzerland as defined in the Declaration of London should be modified, that Switzerland should be released from her undertaking to apply economic and financial measures against a Covenant-breaking State; and that the resulting position of unconditional neutrality should, in the special circumstances of the case, be recognise^, as being compatible with the provisions of the Covenant.In view of the unique position of Switzerland as defined in the international instruments referred to in the first paragraph of this resolution, and in view of the terms of the memorandum submitted by the Swiss Government, the Council recognises the unconditional neutrality of Switzerland as compatible with her membership of the League on the understanding that Switzerland will not, by reason of her special position, seek to place obstacles in the way of collective measures which the members of the League may in the future agree to take in pursuance of their obligaticr-a under the Covenant.
The Council also takes note of the statement in the memorandum submitted by the Swiss Government thaat Switzerland is honoured by being the seat of the League of Nations. The Council understands by this statement that Switzerland will at all times facilitate the functioning of the League of Nations and its constituent bodies on Swiss territory.ANNEX VI.Final Communique.DURING their stay in London M. Daladier and M. Georges Bonnet had a number of conversations with the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and other British Ministers, in the course of which they discussed, in the spirit of mutual confidence which inspires the relations between the two countries, the principal questions which at the present time affect the maintenance of peace.The French and British Ministers reviewed the results of the recent conversa-tions between the Italian Foreign Minister and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome, embodied in the agreement as published. The French Ministers welcomed this contribution to European appeasement. The British Ministers, for their part, expressed the hope that the conversations which the French Government have opened with the Italian Government will lead to equally satisfactory results.The French and British Ministers were of opinion that the appeasement in the Mediterranean which would result from these agreements would contribute to the entry into force of the resolution of the 4th November, 1937, for the with-drawal of foreign participants in the civil war in Spain, and would facilitate the conclusion of agreements for the withdrawal of war material.They devoted close attention to the situation in Central Europe, and found themselves in general agreement on the action that might most usefully be taken to. find the basis of a peaceful and equitable settlement of problems arising in that area.They also touched on certain questions relating to the situation in the Far East, and took the opportunity to discuss certain questions which appeared on the agenda of the forthcoming meeting of the Council of the League of Nations.The two Governments decided to continue, as might be necessary, the contacts between their General Staffs established under the arrangement reached in London on the 19th March, 1936.As a result of the very frank and full discussions which took place, it was once again recognised that France and Great Britain are bound together by a close community of interests, and the French and British Ministers agreed that it was therefore of the highest importance in present circumstances that the two Governments should continue and develop the policy of consultation and collaboration in the defence, not only of their common interests, but also of those ideals of national and international life which unite the two countries.April 29, 1938.
