CONFERENCE OF MINISTERS.Air Raid precautions.Protection of Vital Services.The Conference of Ministers had &quot;before them a Memorandum by /the Home Secretary (Paper CP.  80 (38)) relative to the implementing of the Cahinet decision of 15th. Decembers  1937 (Cahinet 47 (37) Conclusion 7) accepting the principle of a Government contribution towards expenditure on air raid precautions by public utility undertakings additional to that falling on industry generally.      In his Memorandums  the Home Secretary favoured a scheme under which grant would be limited to undertakings in a: certain number of areas selected for their importance from a defence point of view provided that the scheme was not so presented as to suggest that it is the. Governments complete and final solution of the public utilities&apos; problemo      The Memorandum concluded by outlining the only way in which, in the view of the Home Secretary,  the controversy could be successfully dealt with.THE HOME SECRETARY said that ,apart from purely technical air raid precautions difficulties, he was anxious as to the political aspects of the problem^ He was satisfied that it was quite impossible for the Government to lay down that there could be no extension of the areas selected at the outset and that grants would only be pajrabl-e to public utility undertakings in these originally- selected areas,      The Hopkins Committee had apparently contemplated that the selected areas would be final and incapable of any extension. In his,  the Home Secretary&apos;s view,it would be impossible to attempt permanently to maintain such a position in the case of the most essential services.    For example,
-water supply undertakings outside the selected areas. Moreover,  to refuse any extension of those areas would rriean that the urban areas of Lancashire and of parts of Yorkshire, the Tees district and Wales would fall outside the scheme. It seemed clear that the only practicable solution was for the Government to say that they proposed to deal in the first place with the areas where the problem was most urgent, but that this would not preclude the possibility of extending the scheme to other areas in due course.Another question was whether any distinction shouldrbe drawn between one public utility service and another. It might well be that in some areas it would be unnecessary for certain public utility undertakings to embark on the additional precautions whereas it woriild be wise and proper for others, e.g. water supply undertakings, in those areas to do so.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH agreed that regard must be had to this important consideration.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE agreed that it would be politically impossible to treat the areas selected at the outset as the final selection for all time.    On the other hand he thought that there would be strong grounds for refusing to make public any details as to the areas,  etc which would be dealt with in the first instance.    This would mean disclosing to the world that we were going to protect at the outset the targets which we thought were themost dangerous and vulnerable.........THE HOME SECRETARY pointed out that discussions would have to begin at once with the representatives of public- utility undertakings in the selected areas,  and that
disclosure of the areas concerned could not he avoided.MR, EADY explained that       the 12 selected areas in the provisional list were all obviously denselySt tpopulated centres. He did not contemplate that the Bill would give any details as to areas, etc., it would be an enabling Bill similar in this respect to the Rural Water Supplies Act of 1933.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP TRADE agreed that the legislation should take this form.    The Food Storage Bill would also he an enabling Bill on the same general lines.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE hoped that some way would be found of avoiding any public disclosure of the details of what was in contemplation.MR.  EADY explained that most of the works which would have to be carried out by the various public utility undertakings would he engineering works.      Unless the engineers and other technical, experts were informed of the amount of money available and the areas within which the money was to he spent they could not prepare estimates of any value.      For example, at the outset a Technical Committee representative of the Electricity undertakings had prepared plans and estimates which had no relation to what was practicable.
The Electricity Commissioners had advised that theindustry would formulate sensible proposals and estimateswhen they  new how much money would be available.      The&apos; confidencemost hopeful course would be to tell the undertakings   in /what the selected areas were and what money would be forthcoming and ask them to make the best possible plans on this basis.      It v/ould however be most difficult, ifnot impossible,  to keep the scheme and its details secret.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE thought that the most important consideration was that it should be understood that the selected areas represented a first priority list of areas, and that, other areas would be eligible at a later stage. He fully agreed that the legislation should not enter into any details of what it was proposed to undertake.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thought that the legislation should mention the three factors which would determine whether an area was within the scheme,  i.e. (l) size and density of population, (2) vulnerability,(3) production and supply of munitions.The Bill should not attempt to define the areas geographically or otherwise than by reference to the above named factors.      It should however indicate that the Government proposed to deal in the first instance with certain areas which were urgently important from the defence point of view.It might be unwise to give the impression that themeasures to be taken subsequently in the case of the less the same asvulnerable areas would necessarily- be /   the measures to be taken in the case of the first selected areas.If the Government were pressed in Parliament for details the answer should be that the arrangements were
m    95confidential and that it would he contrary to the public interest to disclose them.The Committee agreed with the suggestions made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer as summarised above.THE HOME SECRETARY inquired whether it might not be possible for the Government to introduce enabling legisla-tion in very general terms and of very wide scope.MR. EADY doubted whether such legislation would avoid the political difficulties.      The trouble would come in the main from the areas which were to be left out of the scheme, at any rate for some time to come.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thought that the alternatives were that the Bill should either specify the selected areas in a schedule or should leave the responsible Minister full discretion as to the areas to Which priority should be given.The Committee agreed to adopt the latter alternative, namely,  that the responsible Minister should have full discretion to decide as to the areas to be given priority under the arrangements.The Committee then discussed the financial provisions of the Bill.SIR R. HOPKINS explained that the financial provision would not be contained in the Bill nor would it be a Bill which authorised borrowing.-   The money required would come from Votes and would appear in the annual Estimates.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER assumed that the Government grant would be on the   for   basis, and that this would be provided^for in the Bill.THE HOME SECRETARY agreed.      He hoped that it would be found possible to maintain the   for   basis of the grant.
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE said that it might he found more convenient - to follow the precedents of Educational and. other legislation, and not to prescribe the percentage of grant in the Bill.THE HOME SECRETARY thought that the percentage must &quot;be named in the Bill because this had been done in the case of the legislation giving grants in aid of Local Authority expenditure on Air Raid   Precautions, and it would he very difficult to justify a different procedure in the case of the public utility undertakings.SIR R.  HOPKINS suggested that the negotiations with the public utility undertakings should take place first and, if agreement was reached,  the agreed percentage grant should he named in the Bill.      The Government should also reserve the right to impose a percentage in default of agreement.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER- -pointed out that, among other advantages the fixing in the Bill-&apos;of the percentage of the&quot; grant would make it easier, to deal later on with public utility undertakings in the more remote and less vulnerable areas.      He proposed that provision should be made in the Bill for grants to public utility undertakings on the basis Of   for  , and that every effort should be made to obtain agreement by negotiation in advance of the legislation.-THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE observed thatthe 50 per cent, basis was what it was hoped to get by negotiation.      The history: of the discussions with the on A.R.?.Local Authorities/showed how mistaken the Cabinet had been to tie down the negotiating Ministers to precise figures.      This had not only caused great delay but had undoubtedly resulted-in the terms being more onerous for the Government than would have been the case had the
Ministers concerned been given some discretion at the outset.THE HOME SECRETARY feared that the public utility-undertakings would prove difficult in.regard to finance. It would first be necessary to agree estimates of cost; the Electrical undertakings&apos;  figure was some  5.5 million, and the Government&apos;s offer  1.5 million;    the Gas under-takings1 estimate was some  3 million, and the Governments offer  1 million.     When the estimates had been agreed it would still he necessary to agree the percentage of the Government grant0      He thought that if a deadlock was reached the question of the percentage should he reviewed at a further meeting of MinistersoTHE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE suggested and THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE agreed that any question of the percentage rate of grant should be left to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  t!he Home Secretary and the Minister of Health to settle in consultation.f The Committee agreed:- -(l) That provision should be made in the Bill for grants to public utility undertakings on the basis of   for  , and that eve&apos;ry effort should be made to obtain agreement on this basis in advance by negotiation&apos;&apos;-, with the undertakings;(2) That if in the course of the negotiations . some. adjustment of the   for,   basis is found necessary the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  the Home Secretary and the Minister of Health should be authorised to make the adjustment,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said.that he had been reminded by Sir R, Hopkins, that some of the public utility undertakings, e.g, electrical undertakings, made substantial profits.      Public opinion would not tolerate the Govern-ment being held to ransom in this matter by these prosperous monopolists and there must, he-thought, be a point at which, if the undertakings proved recalcitrant, the Government should fall back on their powers of compulsion.
TIE HOME SECRETARY agreed that in the last resort (and this.should not he too long deferred) the Government might have to use their compulsory powers. ^   The Bill would give grants hut should it not also impose duties on the public utility undertakings?MR.  EADY thought that it would he very difficult for the Bill to impose duties when these would he different, not only as between one area and another, but also as between the various kinds of public utility undertakings.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE pointed out that&apos; if the Bill was to contain compulsory powers it would be very difficult to avoid specifying in the Bill the duties and obligations to he required from the undertakings.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER hoped that any   . compulsory powers would be kept in the badkground and that as little reference as possible would be made to them in the forthcoming discussions with the undertakings.MR.   EADY doubted whether any question of using com-pulsion would arise in the case, at all events, of the selected areas.    The work to be done was in the main engineering work, and it might be anticipated that when the position had been fully explained to the technical experts of the undertakings ways and means would be found of overcoming economically the more formidable difficulties. In the result, actual expenditure might work out at very much less than the provisional estimates which had been prepared without any precise knowledge of the Government1s intentions.    In this connection regard should be had to the importance of ensuring that labour and materials in the selected areas were not diverted from munitions production to air raid precautions engineering works beyond what
was reasonable and. adequate.The Conference of kinisters agreed :- .^(l) To request the Chancellor of the Exchequer to report verbally to the Cabinet at their Meeting on Wednesday,- April 6the ? 1.938,  the conclusions reached as a result of the examination of Co Po  80 (38), These Conclusions may be summarised as follows  :(a) The suggestions of the Home Secretary for dealing- with the problem outlined in paragraph 3 (a) to (f) inclusive of G* ?,  80 (38) should be accepted in principle.That the necessary legislation should not attempt to define the areas geo-graphically or otherwise than by reference to three factors, viz:(l) size and density of population(2) vulnerability(3) production and supply of munitions.It should be clearly indicated that the Government proposed,to deal in the first instance with certain areas which are of urgent importance from the .point of view of defence^While it would be understood that the measures to be taken would not necessarily be the same in all areas, care should be taken not to create the Impression at the outset that the measures to be taken in the less . vulnerable areas would be the same in. kind and in extent    as   those to be taken in the first selected areas.That the Bill-should not specify the selected areas but that the responsible Ministers should be given full dis-cretion to decide as to areas to be given priority under the arrangements.(d) That if the Government were pressed fordetails of the arrangements and the areas, the reply should be to the effect that the information was confidential and that &quot;it would be contrary to the public interest to disclose itsV(b)(c)
(e) That provision should he made in the Bill for grants to public utility undertakings 011 the basis of   for   and that every effort should he made to obtain agreement on this basis in advance by negotiation with the under-takings. If, however, in the&quot; course of the negotiations some adjustment of the   for   basis is found necessary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretary and the Minister of Health should he authorised to make the adjustment.(f) That the Bill should.contain provisions empowering the Government, in the&apos;-last resort, to exercise compulsion in tin-case of recalcitrant undertakings.(2) That the draft Conclusions of the meeting should he circulated to the Cabinet for consideration at the Meeting on April 6th. , 1938, in connection with Item 6   on the Agenda for that Meeting., Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1* 5th. April,- 1938.
