SECRET. CP.  119(58).COPY NO. SOC A B I N E -T.CIVIL AVIATION.GERMAN PENETRATION IN THE NEAR AND PAR EAST. .Note by the Minister for Co-ordinationof&quot; Defence.At a Meeting51 held on the 2nd June 1937 theCabinet had before them a Memorandum   by the Secretaryof State for Air on the subject of German Penetration inthe Near and Par East.      The Cabinet agreed:-&quot;(b)    That the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air on German penetration in the Near and Par East (CP.  14-5(37)) , together with the above summary of the Cabinet discussion,  should be referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence for &apos; consideration and report.&quot;2. In accordance with this Cabinet decision, theCommittee of Imperial Defence considered, the Memorandum^by the Secretary of State for Air and the Cabinet Con-clusions thereon, together with a Memorandum^ by theSecretary of State for India,  at a Meeting^ held on the17th June and agreed,  inter alia:-&quot;(i)    To approve the principle that we ought to try and stop the development of a foreign air route if it would adversely affect some important strategic interest.a   Cabinet 23(37) Conclusion 6./   C.I.D.

(ii)    That, since it is a strategic interest to Iceep hoth Germany and Russia out of Afghanistan, we should encourage the Afghan Government to maintain their ^ ohjecfion. to conceding landing facilities to either the Germans or the Russians.(iii)    That the proposal of the Secretary of Statefor India (Paper No.  1333-B, paragraph 9(a)) that facilities on the route Persia-Karachi-Delhi should he offered, (subject to the consent of the Government of India) to the Germans, should he referred to the Inter-departmental Committee on International Air Communications, for consideration and rep or to3. In pursuance of Conclusion (iii) above,  thequestion of the grant of facilities on the route Persia-Karachi-Delhi to a German company was referred to the Interdepartmental Committee on International Air Communications, and the recommendation of this Committee was embodied in and endorsed by a Memorandum^ by the Secretary of State for Air which was considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence at a Meeting&apos;^ held on the 14th October 1937.      It was suggested in this Memorandum, that the visit of the German Air Force Mission headed by General Milch would afford an opportunity of letting the Germans know that if they asked for facilities across India and Burma by the normal route, we would be ready to offer them, it being made clear, however, that our offer would be conditional on their abandonment of the Kabul route. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed:-x x x x&quot;(b)    To concur in the view expressed by the Secretary of State for Air that,  in his coversations with General Milch, .  he should take the following line(i)    that, if possible, General Milch should be induced to volunteer a request for transit facilities for German aircraft across India.K   Also C.-I.D. Paper No.  1356-B. /   C.I.D./299th Meeting, Minute 3.
(ii)    that, failing such a request, Lord Swinton should himself offer these facilities.(iii)    that General Milch should he allowed to &quot;believe that our objection t o  the German use of *- the route through Afghanistanwas due to our anxiety that the Russians would inevitably demand similar facilities which it would be very difficult for the Afghan Government to refuse, if they had acceded to the German request.&quot;4. Acting on Conclusion (b)(i) to (iii) above,  theSecretary of State for Air had a conversation withGeneral Milch on the 18th October 1937,and a Notes  of this conversation was considered by the Committee of imperialDefence at a Meeting^ held on the 28th 0ctobero     At thismeeting the Committee of Imperial Defence agreed:-&quot;That the Secretary of State for India should be invited to inform the Government of India of the developments which made it probable that the German Government would shortly make a request for air transit facilities across India, but that pending the receipt of this request, no other action was called for&quot;.5. On the 12th March 1938 ffye German Governmentsubmitted an official application to liis Majesty5 s Govern-ment for transit facilities across India and Burma for a German air service to the Far East.     At the same time, ignoring the stipulation that our offer of these facilities was conditional on their abandonment of the Kabul route, the Germans continued to press the Afghan Government to grant them facilities for this route as well*6. The subsequent history of this case is given in ax   C.I.D. Paper No. 13S0-B./   0.1.D./300th Meeting, Minute 10.

Paper No. 1360-B.)Joint Memorandum by the Secretaries of State for India and Air. THE Committee of Imperial Defence agreed on the 17th June, 1937* :-&quot; That since it is a strategic interest to keep both Germany and Russia out of Afghanistan, we should encourage the Afghan Government to maintain their objection to conceding landing facilities to either the Germans or the Russians,&quot;and His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Kabul was instructed accordingly in a despatch of the 15th July, 1937. There has been frequent correspondence with Kabul on the subject since that date, and both the Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires and His Majesty&apos;s Minister have done what was possible to discourage the Afghans from granting landing facilities to the Germans. As recently as the 13th March last the Minister reported that, though he had not lately discussed with Afghan Ministers the general attitude of the Afghan Government to this service, he saw no reason to suppose that it had changed since last year, when his impression had been &quot;that, while some of the younger generation would be glad to open Afghanistan to foreign air services, the more responsible members of the Govern-ment were chiefly anxious to avoid the establishment of a regular Soviet air service, which they feared would be the outcome of any concession granted to the Germans. They would thus have been glad of any means of escape from the -German proposals if a way could be found without offending the German Government.&quot;Later telegrams from Kabul of the 14th and 21st April have, however, revealed a change in the attitude of the Afghan Government. The Afghan Prime Minister indicated to Colonel Fraser-Tytler on the 12th April that this change was due to the fact that the Afghan Government no longer had the same fear of Soviet reactions and to the effect of the Saadabad Pact, which had caused the Afghan Government to endeavour to orient their foreign policy in accordance with that of their co-signatories, Iraq and Iran, who for their part have now granted facilities for the German service. Colonel Fraser-Tytler warned the Afghan Prime Minister regarding the possible motives underlying the German request for facilities from the Afghan Government, but in his telegram of the 14th April he expressed a doubt whether the Prime Minister would be able, even if he wished, to resist the pressure of the German request plus the natural desire of the younger Afghans to have so direct a link with Europe. The Foreign Minister has since informed Colonel Fraser-Tytler that the Afghan Government proposed to follow the example of Iran by permitting a weekly, service to Kabul, on condition of a separate application for each flight, and has indicated that representations by the Soviet Ambassador against the German service have irritated the Afghan Government and stiffened their determination to grant facilities.   ,In the light of this information it seems clear that we should only antagonise both the Afghans and the Germans by any further attempt to oppose the German&apos; - * Minutes C.LD./294th Meeting, Conclusion 11 (ii),    &apos;v;[17192] &quot;   &apos;m    &apos;SECRET.
service to Kabul.   It seems, therefore, expedient to acquiesce in this service withas good a grace as possible.    -.............-..........-....................    -.......................................- -  _______________,., Meanwhile, following on the conversation between the Secretary of State for Air ahd General Milch on the 18th October last, recorded in C.I.D. Paper No. 1360 -B, the German Government have,,on the 12th March, submitted, an official applica-tion to His Majesty&apos;s Government for transit facilities on the usual route across India and Burma for . a German air service to the Far East, with a terminus for the present at Bangkok. It will be remembered that one of our objects in deciding to offer the Germans facilities on the Indian route was to divert them, if possible, from developing the CentralAsian route via Afghanistan and Sinkiang to link up with the Japanese in the Far East. Although the Germans are starting flights via Tehran to Kabul, while simultaneously applying to us for facilities on the southern route across India and Burma for a service following the coast of the Persian Gulf, it may be hoped that the grant of the latter facilities would greatly diminish any incentive which they might otherwise have for pressing on with the development of the difficult Central Asian route to the Far East. The question, however, arises whether it would be politic to make the grant of transit facilities on the Indian route conditional on the abandonment by the German Government of the Central Asian route or to state our &quot;understanding&quot; that the German service across India would be in substitution for the service originally contemplated to the Far East via,Sinkiang. This aspect of the question has been exhaustively examined by the Foreign Office, the Air Ministry and the India Office, and as a result it is felt by the Air Ministry and the India Office that in the altered circumstances it would be desirable, for the following reasons, to &quot;grant the German request without referring to any such condition or &apos;&apos; understanding &quot; :  (1) It is no longer practicable to oppose a German service as far as Kabul;(2) In present circumstances, in view of Soviet influence in Sinkiang and -the physical difficulties of flying across the Pamirs, especially in winter, there is little likelihood that the Germans will, in fact, be able to extend their Afghan service across Sinkiang, at any rate for some time to come;(3) To ask the Germans to give up the idea of such a service is therefore unnecessary at the present time, and it would detract from the value of our offer of facilities in India and Burma as a gesture of goodwill to the German Government;(4) If the offer of these facilities were made in ally way conditional on the relinquishment of any German plans for flying in, or through, &quot;Afghanistan, it would be necessary beforehand to inform the Afghan Government of the condition (otherwise they might easily hear of it first from the Germans), and the Afghan Government would be very likely to resent our bargaining with a third Power in a matter which they would regard as primarily their own concern;(5) It is to our advantage to encourage the Germans to build up &quot;vested , interests &quot;on the Indian route which Great Britain could control incase of war;(6) An unconditional offer still seems the best means of diverting the Germans from any future intention of developing the Sinkiang route in co-operation with the Japanese;(7) The adoption of this course might create German goodwill and enable us to secure reciprocal facilities from them in other quarters when required for the development of British Air Services. This might be of particular value in promoting co-operation forthwith between Imperial Airways and Eurasia: (a Sino-German concern) in China.An early decision is desirable in order that a reply may be sent without ; delay by the Air Ministry to the German Government&apos;s. application of the 12th March for the trans-India Service.   Otherwise much of the value of an &apos; unqualified consent to this service as a bargaining counter will be lost.:r,\--:-: .... .

Copy No-COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 322nd Meeting held on May 12, 1938.^ ^ jfe $fe ^(7) CIVIL AVIATION-GERMAN PENETRATION IN THE FAR EAST..(C.I.D. Paper No. 1429-B.)(Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 300th Meeting-Minute 10.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a joint memorandum by the Secretaries of State for India and Air on the subject of German Penetration in the Far East in the field of civil aviation.   (OLD. Paper No. 1429-B.)LORD ZETLAND said that when this matter first came before the Committee last June, it had been agreed &quot; that, since it is a strategic interest to keep both Germany and Russia out of Afghanistan, we should encourage the Afghan Government to maintain their objection to conceding landing facilities to either the Germans or the Russians.&quot;   Acting on this he had done what he could to discourage the Afghans from granting concessions which were being sought by the Germans, but he had foreseen that this would be difficult.     With a view therefore to diverting the Germans from developing the Central Asian route via Afghanistan to the Far East, it had been agreed with the Secretary of State for Air that the Germans should be offered transit facilities across India and Burma. This proposal had been put to General Milch on the occasion of the visit of the German Air Force Mission to this country last October with, however, the important qualification which had been made clear to General Milch that our offer was conditional on their abandonment of the Kabul route.   It was now clear that General Milch was ignoring the conditional character of our offer, and that the Germans were working for both the Kabul and the Trans-Indian route.   Mean-while, the Afghans had found it impossible to continue to oppose the German requests, in view of similar requests which had been granted by Iraq and Iran;, and they had therefore decided to permit a weekly German service to Kabul.   In these altered circumstances he had been faced with the difficult problem of recom-mending what reply ought to be made to the official application which had been, received from the German Government on the 12th March for transit facilities, across India, and, in particular, whether our acquiescence should be made coh-ditional on the abandonment by the Germans of the Kabul route, as we had originally intended that it should be.   Very reluctantly he had agreed with the Secretary of State for Air, for the reasons set out in paragraph (1) to (7) of the Memorandum, that the German request should be granted unconditionally.   He would, however, like to warn the Committee that the German air penetration into Afghanistan would inevitably increase the influence and economic grip of Germany 911 that country, which, from our point of view, was extremely undesir-able.   Thus, the arguments were very evenly balanced, and it was for that reason that he had referred the matter to the Committee.LORD SWINTON said that this was a-matter about which the Air Ministry-must take the advice of the Foreign and India Offices.   The whole question had; been thoroughly thrashed out by the Interdepartmental Committee on Inter-national Air Communications under the Chairmanship of Sir Warren Fisher. This Committee had come to the conclusion that, disagreeable as it was, it was[17212- 1J
not practicable: to refuse the German request. He had done his best to persuade General Milch and had, in particular, emphasised the disadvantages and dangers of the&apos; Kabul route,, but, as wo had reason to know, Milch was not to be trusted. We were now faced with the fait accompli that the Germans had obtained their licence from trie Afghans, following the precedent of Iraq a*nd Iran.&apos; We were hardly in a position to tell the Germans that we would not allow them across India unless they &quot;cleared out &quot; of Afghanistan, and there was therefore little to be gained by refusal. On the other hand, there remained the fact that we Were still very anxious to prevent the projection of the German service eastwards beyond Kabul through Sinkiang and Central Asia to link up with the Japanese. By giving the Germans transit facilities across India there seemed at least a hope of delaying, if not of diverting them, from the Sinkiang route. Furthermore, as a matter of principle, he would like to repeat his conviction that it was an illusion to suppose that we could go on indefinitely denying foreigners the freedom of the air for the development of civil aviation, any more than of the sea. For these reasons he felt that more harm than good would be done by refusing the German request.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART explained that the Foreign Office view was that it seemed illogical in principle that, having agreed, as we originally had, that we should allow the Germans transit facilities across India on condition that they withdrew from Afghanistan, we should now allow them the best of both worlds. The recommendation in favour of this was based on the argument contained in paragraph (6) of the Memorandum, i.e., that &quot; an unconditional offer still seemed the best means of diverting the Germans from any future intention of developing the Sinkiang route in co-operation with the Japanese.&quot; He himself had always been sceptical about the validity of this argument, and his doubts had recently been confirmed by reliable information that the Germans intended to go on developing the Sinkiang route. He therefore suggested that we should reply to the German request either that we now understood that they were proposing to develop the Kabul-Sinkiang route and that we therefore presumed that they would not want the Indian route, or, alternatively, that we would grant them air transit facilities across India subject to our getting equivalent facilities, e.g., in connection with the Eurasia Company.SIR WARBEN FISHER explained that his Committee had been over this ground again and again. They would have liked to suggest that we should impose restrictions on Germany. As regards Kabul, this was impossible; as regards India, it was difficult by reason of the fact that we had already granted similar facilities to other foreign countries. One strong argument in favour of encouraging the development of a German air line through India was that it would be at our mercy in case of war. Furthermore, we were anxious to divert them from other spheres of influence which we were particularly anxious to develop and preserve for ourselves, e.g., the Atlantic. It had been suggested that in giving the Germans the right to cross India, we should demand a quid pro quo. This, in fact, we always did. Consideration was at the moment being given to the possible extension of our European air services to Vienna, and it was conceivable that the Germans might make difficulties. We might tell them that they would not get what they wanted in India unless they behaved properly over Vienna.LORD SWINTON said that it was the common practice to make such air agreements conditional on reciprocity, and that the concession of transit facilities -across India could be conveniently made a bargaining lever for what we should -eventually require in Europe. Our plans in Europe were, however, not yet sufficiently formulated to be stated definitely. He therefore suggested that our i, offer should be made for a definite term of years and in such a form which would enable us to Withdraw.it in the event of the Germans refusing to reciprocate elsewhere at some later date.L LORD ZETLAND felt that whilst this proposal seemed attractive in theory, it would be very difficult in practice to deny facilities, once the Germans had established their air line across India.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART agreed. He would prefer to see pur offer -combined with a request for reciprocal facilities between Imperial Airways and the Sino-German concern of Eurasia.
Mr. HORE-BELISHA asked whether it would &apos; be possible1 fOr India to -develop a British air line between Delhi and Kabul, with the&apos;Object of -showing the flag in Afghanistan as a counter to German penetration:        -    .^ ;     SoLORD ZETLAND pointed out that it had been the consistent policy of the Government of &quot;India to maintain the&apos; North-West frontier as a prohibited area.&quot; He,felt that She suggestion for&apos;a reversal of this policy raised an issue which was too large and complicated to be considered at the,moment. .,       &apos;,,.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that the discussion had   clearly: shown that we were not in a position to. stop the Germans going to Kabul, and that, on balance, it appeared preferable to tell the Germans that we were prepared to offer them transit facilities across India, subject to an engagement from them that we shoiild obtain such reciprocal facilities elsewhere as we might require from them. - ;/:Conclusions. .&apos;, .   ... . v ,.- .t 5 ..v:.&apos;The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed(a) That for the reasons stated in the Joint Memorandum,by the secretaries of State for India and Air (C.I.D. Paper No. 1429-B) and in these Minutes, it would now be both impracticable and impolitic to attempt to prevent the Germans establishing an air line to Kabul, permission for which they had obtained from the Afghan Government.(b) That it would, on balance, be to our advantage to grant the Germans the transit facilities for which they were asking on the usual route across India and Burma for an Air Service to the Far East.(c) That the Secretary of State for Air should accordingly be invited toinform the Germans in reply to their official application of the 12th March, 1938, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to grant the facilities for which they asked on the, understanding that this concession carried with it a definite engagement on the part of the German Government to grant reciprocal facilities when required for the development of British Air Services in other quarters, and, in particular, between Imperial Airways and the Sino-German concern of Eurasia in China. -(d)- To invite the Secretary of State for India to inform the Government of India in the sense of paragraphs (a) to (c) above.-jfc -Jf&quot; 4t* ^   .2 Whitehall Gardens, S.
