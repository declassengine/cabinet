THIS document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1938.SECRET. *  Copy No.CP. 99 (38).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.DEFENCE EXPENDITURE IN FUTURE YEARS-THE WAR office programme.Further Report by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.ON the 16th February last the Cabinet approved, subject to certain observa-tions on particular points, my Further Report on Defence Expenditure in Future Years (CP. 24 (38)). For convenience of reference the Cabinet Conclusions are attached as Appendix I to this Report.The main conclusions were that the figure of  1,650 millions should be taken as the maximum sum which can be regarded as available for all defence purposes over the five years 1937-41; that the total up to which the three Defence Depart-ments may work for the period should be  1,570 millions, and that, after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Defence Ministers, I should prepare as soon as possible for submission to the Cabinet a plan for the definite allocation of the  1,570 millions between the three Defence Services. My attention was invited to the importance attached by several of my colleagues to the development of the programmes in the early years of the quinquennium.2. On the 11th March, prior to arranging a meeting for the discussion of the allocation, I wrote to the Defence Ministers suggesting the sort of figures which from a preliminary survey I had in my own mind. The totals which I thus contemplated for the five years, and the revised forecasts previously submitted by the Departments, are as follows : Suggested Allocations. . . (Millions.) Admiralty    .........      582War Office   ....      ....      481.     AirMinistry....      ....      5071,570 1,769-0&apos; . :    1,811-0? Paragraph 28.pf C.P. .24 (38).

3. Since the date of the Cabinet approval of the recommendations contained in my Further Report political developments in Europe have caused the Cabinet to decide upon the acceleration and expansion of the approved programmes, particularly for Air and Anti-Aircraft Defences. The Prime Minister, in his statement in the House of Commons on the 24th March last, said : &quot; there must be an increase frt some parts of the programme, especially in&apos; that of the Royal Air Eorce and the anti-aircraft defences.&quot; Attention has thus been concentrated on what increased output it is practicable by various special measures to achieve in the next two years. The programme for the Air Force is being examined in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decision of the 6th April; the investigations must, I think, be carried further before the allocation of a quota to the Air Ministry can be considered. In the case of the War Office, however, the Secretary of State has represented to me that, in order to fix the scope and pace of production, it is essential for him to know the limits of his task, and has submitted proposals for the settlement of the War Office allocation. A copy of the Secretary of State&apos;s letter to me setting out his detailed proposals is attached as Appendix II.The Cabinet will recall that the figures in the revised War Office forecast included both normal services and the capital expenditure on the defence require-ments programme. The aggregate total for the latter was  347 millions, spread as follows : 1936 and 1937        .........1938 to 1941 .........1942   .........Remaining to complete after 1942 Contingencies (not allocated by years)Total        ......       ...  millions.42 245-5 29 10-5 20347The effect of the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals is to reduce by  70 millions this aggregate of  347 millions capital expenditure, there being no alteration in the estimates for normal services in the years 1938 to 1942, as given in the revised War Office forecast.The Cabinet decision of the 16th February was expressed in terms of the allocation of our available resources during the 5 years 1937-41; while the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals are related to a programme of capital expenditure which, according to the latest forecast, is not expected to be completed by March 1942! It is clear, therefore, that the whole of the reduction now offered by the Secretary of State for War will not accrue during the period 1937-41, but that some part of it will, so far as can be foreseen, relate to the years 1942 and 1943. Nevertheless, I recommend that the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals should be approved by the Cabinet.At the same time it is necessary that I should call attention to the importance of certain of these proposals, particularly those in regard to the Field Force and the Air Defences.   I therefore submit below explanatory notes on these subjects.Field Force.4. The requirements of the Field Force have been calculated on the basis that it is to be equipped for general Imperial Defence purposes and not expressly for a continental campaign. This modification has enabled substantial reductions to be made in certain items, e.g., tanks and reserves of ammunition; on the other hand, it has necessitated increases of various stores owing to the distance from the source of supply. The net effect was to reduce the capital cost of equipping the Field Force by  14 millions. The Secretary of State now proposes a further reduction of  1^ millions, to be obtained mainly by decreasing the reserves of certain types of ammunition.The Field Force as now contemplated will consist of the following :- . (a) Two Regular Divisions, a Mobile Division, Corps Headquarters and &quot; the necessary ancillary troops, capable of despatch overseas within-three weeks. Their war reserves of ammunition would be, to all intents and purposes, on a Continental scale; the equipment and the composition of the supporting troops would be slightly different from that which the War Office would employ if these formations were primarily intended for warfare on the Continent.
3&quot;  235(b) Two further Regular Divisions with the necessary ancillary troops- &apos; capable of despatch overseas within 40 days, but with war reserves- - at only half the- scale of (a).In the revised forecast, provision was made for a pool of war equipment and reserves for the Territorial Army at a cost of  15 millions. The pool could have been used to enable two Territorial or Regular Divisions or their equivalent to take the field after the fourth month. This is now deleted, though the saving on Territorial Army Equipment and Reserves becomes  13 millions owing to the addition of  2 millions to the cost of providing training equipment for the Territorial Army of the same type as that of the Regular Army.In this connection I would draw attention to the Secretary of State&apos;s observations : &quot;It must be clearly understood that if this is adopted it will not be possible for two Territorial or Regular divisions or their equivalent to take the field after the fourth month of war as stated in the &apos; Role of the Army &apos; paper CP. 26 (38). There will, therefore, be no reserve contingents to support the 4 divisions and mobile division after they have been despatched abroad, and it is doubtful whether such support could be ready, so far as the provision of equipment and reserves is concerned, for 12 months or more after the outbreak of war. It would be disastrous to attempt to send these divisions against a modern enemy before they are properly equipped.&quot;Air Defence of Great Britain.5. The ground formations, artillery and searchlights, in the organisation for the Air Defence of Great Britain, are to all intents and purposes a new service, the whole cost of which falls on War Office Votes. Though the formations are almost entirely manned by Territorials, the initial cost of equipment and accommodation is very heavy.In the revised forecast of capital expenditure the figure for general charges and ammunition was  97-8 millions. This was the cost of implementing a revised scheme, drawn up early in 1937, which included 158 batteries and 196 searchlight companies, as compared with a programme then existing of 76 batteries and 108 searchlight companies. The revised scheme was based on military considerations, representing the defence requirements at the time in the light of the higher performance of attacking machines and the higher scale of air attack, but without regard to limitations of finance or production. When it came before the C.I.D. in June 1937, their view was that the revised scheme was by no means an over-insurance.The defences take the form of a continuous Aircraft Fighting Zone inter-posed between the attacker and his main objectives, with local defences to cover ports and industrial areas. The Cabinet, on considering &quot;my Interim Report (CP. 316 (37)), approved the first two additional stages in the revised scheme, namely, the extension of the Zone, which previously ran from Portsmouth round London to the Tees, to cover the defences of the Tyne and the provision of local defences for the Forth and Clyde. These stages involve the addition of 4 batteries and 20 searchlight companies.The Air Defence organisation has subsequently been submitted for a further detailed review so that the lay-out may accord with recent technical develop-ments and furnish the proper counterpart of the fighter aircraft. This review is still in progress, but certain improvements have been recommended ad interim within the limits of what it is practicable to achieve during the next two years. In the result the C.I.D., on the 7th April, approved the following additions :  the formation of 44 Searchlight Companies to enable the Zone to be brought round the West of London, to increase its breadth from 26 to 40 miles and to extend it from Portsmouth to Bristol;the formation of 40 batteries to be equipped in the first instance with 320 3-inch guns which, though of old pattern, have been specially converted for use pending the delivery of the new 3-7&apos;-inch and 4-5-inch equipments and which become surplus when the latter are issued.[17091]   &apos; b 2
The Secretary of State for War&apos;s latest proposals include provision for the additions set out in the preceding paragraph. It is possible that in the course of the current review further improvements may be recommended. In particular, the C.I.D. have asked that the additional expense of increasing the breadth of the Zone, where practicable, to 50 miles may be examined. The main difference between the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals and the revised scheme drawn up early in 1937, accounting for the greater part of the saving of  28f millions, is that instead of having 1,264 new 3-7-inch and 4-5-inch gun equipments, the defences will include 640 new 3-7-inch and 4-5-inch equipments and 320 3-inch A.A. guns already in existence. It should, however, be noted that the programme for the production of 640 new 3-7-inch and 4-5-inch equipments is unlikely to be completed before January 1940. ,6. There are other reductions which, though not so serious in their effect on the defences of the United Kingdom, nevertheless deserve special notice. The main armaments of Malta and Gibraltar are to receive no further modernisation. The Italian Treaty provides an invaluable alleviation of any immediate anxiety in the Mediterranean, but it cannot in my submission be regarded as a substitute for a permanent improvement in the defences of these key positions in Imperial defence. The Territorial Army will be limited to training equipment, and will be unready for active service for 12 months. I should anticipate that the effect of this decision, when made known, will be prejudicial to recruitment.7. The intensification of our effort to complete rearmament as soon as possible is in practice difficult to reconcile with the limitations imposed on the Defence Departments under the financial review. &apos; The Secretary of State for War has made proposals to give effect to the Cabinet decisions. While I submit these proposals for approval, it seems to me right to call attention to the conse-quences, so that we may take the decisive steps with our eyes open.(Initialled) T. W. H.

g fil fl 236APPENDIX I.   &apos; &apos; ,;&apos;Cabinet Conclusions on the further Report by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, February 16, 1938 (Cabinet 5 (38)).-THE Cabinet agreed,     :(a) To approve generally the Further Report of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence on Defence Expenditure in Future Years; (CP. 24 (38)), as providing for the due distribution and use of our available resources in accordance with the principles already approved by the Cabinet and set forth in paragraphs 6 to 14 of the earlier Report (C.P. 316 (37)); the main conclusions of the Ministers Report may be summed up as follows : (i) That the figure of  1,650 millions should be taken as the maximum sum which can be regarded as available for all defence purposes over the five years 1937-41. Out of this sum it is.necessary to provide the expenditure of  40 millions for Air Raid Precautions, other civil defence measures  20 millions, and interest on sums borrowed under the Defence Loans Act, 1937,  24 millions. After deducting a total provision of  84 millions for these items, the total limit up to which the Defence Departments may work for the period 1937-41 is  1,570 millions (OP. 24 (38), paragraphs 55 and 56).(ii) That the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, after consulta-tion with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministers&apos; - at the head of the Service Departments, should as soon as possible prepare a plan for the definite allocation of the  1,570 millions between the three Defence Services, as submitted to the Cabinet (paragraph 58).(iii) It will be the duty of each Service Department to draw up programmes which can be carried to effective completion, within the sum allotted, by March 1942. These programmes must be complete in themselves, and no undertaking can be given that additions thereto will be sanctioned. The allotment of annual expenditure made to each Department for the years 1938-41 should govern (i) the expenditure which may be incurred by each Department in 1938-39, and (ii) the commit-ments to be entered into by the Defence Departments during 1938-39 in respect of the remaining years of the quinquennium (paragraph 60).(iv) A further enquiry should be undertaken in the year 1939 in orderto consider whether, in the light of the international situation as it then exists, it is on balance regarded as necessary and possible to authorise defence programmes of a wider scope and involving greater expenditure than those which can be compassed within the proposed limit of  1,570 millions&apos;. This does not, of course, preclude review of the authorised programmes at any time if the international situation should undergo such changes as to render possible reductions in these programmes (paragraph 62).-(b) To take note of the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that a  1,650 millions programme for 1937-41 represents a very heavy strain indeed on national finances, which could not in any event be exceeded on the review two years hence save under the most compelling circum-stances and at the cost of financial disorganisation, such as would weaken the power of resistance of the country;ic) To invite the attention of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, in preparing his Report on allocation referred to in (a) (ii) above, to give careful consideration to the question of war reserves for the Royal Air Force, which, however, will have to be considered in the light of the. relative importance to be attached to the requirements of all three&quot; Services;
(d) That, without waiting for the completion of the Minister for Co-ordina-tion of Defence&apos;s Report on the allocation of expenditure between the three Services, the Secretary of State for Air should have authority to place contracts extending beyond the year 1939 to the extent of a percentage to be agreed between him and the Minister for Co-ordina-tion of Defence. This decision is subject to the inclusion of a break claTrse in all such contracts; &apos;(e)&quot; That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, in consultation with the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, should draw up and submit to the Prime Minister a communication based on the Further Report by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP. 24 (38)) and the discussion of the Cabinet thereon for the information of the Prime Ministers of the Dominions, under cover of a letter from the Prime Minister;(/) To invite the attention of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to the importance attached by several members of the Cabinet to the development of the programmes in the early years of the quinquennium.APPENDIX II.Letter from the Secretary of State for War to the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence.War Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1, April 11, 1938.  &apos;WITH a view to implementing the Prime Ministers statement on acceleration-tion and priority of rearmament:- (1) I wrote to you on the 24th March asking if we might have authority to proceed on the basis of the revised Army requirements indicated in CP. 24 (38) amounting to a total of  347 millions.(2) Your letter of the 29th March referred to a letter you had written me on the 11th March, calling for a reduction of  82 millions in the Conspectus figures, not as a whole, but on the first four years only.You were good enough to say that the steps necessary to carry out the measures-of acceleration on which the Cabinet had decided should be dealt with first and that, every possible effort should be made to lay out in the next two years as much as possible of the money intended to be spread over a longer period. But you asked me to give consideration to your letter of the 11th March in order that we might settle the problem of allocation of funds as soon as the measures of acceleration had been decided upon.(3) I have been considering the position in conjunction with my military and financial advisers, but I must say that to leave us in doubt about the reduction, if any, to be made in the total sum to be allocated to the Army places us in a difficult position.  The Treasury, I understand, agree with us on this point.A reduction in a given total of Army expenditure does not mean lopping a number of units; it means a re-examination of the details that go to make up each head of the Army programme. We then have to recalculate Army requirements on a new basis. For instance, a decision not to increase the number of units to be provided for air defence affects the number of guns, of ammunition, of stores, of drill halls for the units and of magazines and storehouses for their equipment. A reduction in the number of tank units affects the number of tanks required both for equipment and for reserve and may mean a recalculation of the&apos; productive capacity necessary both to produce the number of tanks originally required and to ^maintain them in the field.(4) Pari passu with any reductions we may be called on to make, we are also called upon to fit the Army for^ a role which has been recently redefined by the Government and the requirements of which are provided for in the &quot;new Conspectus.(5) The problem now before us is how to carry out the Prime Minister&apos;s state-ment of acceleration, and if we are to fix the base and pace of production we must *know the exact limits of our task.
(6) For this reason I cannot leave over, as you invite me to do, the settlement of the total, and I am quite prepared, provided you realise the implications, to try, without sacrificing the bones of. the new role, to make a substantial contribution towards the  82 millions which you adumbrate as the rough sum to be reduced.(7) In your letter-you mention four years as the period over &quot;which this reduction should be effected. To make the reduction in four years, at a time when our objective is to concentrate the maximum of result in the minimum of time, is in effect to impose a far more serious cut than I think you can have intended.(8) I have, therefore, had some semi-omcial discussion with the Treasury, as a result of which I understand that they would be prepared, should you agree, to recommend the acceptance of a reduction something approximating to  82 millions on the total Army D.R.C. programme of  347 millions, and would not press that this reduction should be confined to the prospective expenditure of  245 millions which the new Conspectus showed as likely to be spent during the four years 1938 to 1941. I would like to know that you agree that the reduction should come off the total capital programme. As regards the amount I hope&apos;you will be able to ^accept  70 millions : it is, I think, the utmost we could contemplate.(9) I next come to the manner of achieving this reduction. I have had our programme re-examined and am driven to the conclusion that any cuts must be made in the capital provision for defence requirements.The following are the best suggestions I can make :  Million  .(i) Field Force. Reduce by        ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        liThis reduction would be obtained mainly by decreasing the reserves of certain types of ammunition.(ii) Defended Ports A broad (other than Singapore) ...       ...        3(a) Counter bombardment Malta and Gibraltar 200,000(b) Additional defences Malta......... 2,300,000(c) Curtailment of Approved Defences HongKong............... 500,000This involves :  (a) Malta and Gibraltar.   No further modernization of counter-bombardment armament.(b) The defences of Malta to remain as approved when wewere not considering war with a Mediterranean Power.(c) Stoppage of further work after completion of pro-gramme for 1938.^iii) Home Ports       ...      ...      ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        2This involves stopping the programme after completion&apos; of the portion already approved by C.I.D. and after the replacement of obsolete ammunition in all ports.,(iv) A.D.G.B. ...      .........       ...       ...       ...       ...      28fThis reduction is on the basis that the Northern extension of A.D.G.B. is carried out arid that recommenda-tion of the H.D.C. for 44 Searchlight Companies and 40 batteries of existing 3-in. guns is approved. No provi-v sion is made in these figures for purchase of 3-7-in. guns additional to the above.(v) Industrial mobilization ...       ... -     ...       ...       ...       ...        4\As stated in the note to the War Office Table on expenditure published in CP. 24 (38), the Admiralty and the Air Ministry will contribute part of the cost of industrial mobilization and credit to Army Funds to the extent of  4^ millions may fairly be assumed.
(Signed) LESLIE HORE BELISHA.v Million  (vi) T.A. War Equipment and Reserves&apos;  ..:   v ...      ...      13If savings approximating to even  70 millions are to be made, drastic cutstare inevitable.   It is proposed most t, i &apos; reluctantly, therefore, to make no provision for war equip-ment --and reserves for the T.A., but to increase the provision for their training equipment from  7,458,000/1$.  9,458,000, since it appears unlikely that the reduction of 2 T.A. field divisions which the former figure assumed will take place. It must be clearly understood that, if this is adopted, it will not be possible for two Territorial or Regular divisions or their equivalent to take the field after the fourth month of war, as stated in the &quot; Role of the Army &quot; paper CP. 26 (38). There will, therefore, be no , reserve contingents to support the 4 divisions and mobile division after they have been despatched abroad, and it is doubtful whether such support could be ready, so far as the provision of equipment and reserves is concerned, for 12 months or more after the outbreak of war. It would be disastrous to attempt to send these divisions against a modern enemy before they are properly equipped.: .: (vii) Improved Accommodation for the Regular Army   ...      ...        7-g-This cut will mean that it will be impossible to .  complete the replacement and modernization of barracks unless subsequently further funds are available.(viii) Contingencies ...       ...       ...       ...       ... ...       ...       10In dealing with the programme of this size, which is affected not only by the requirements of the military authorities, but by the demands of other Government Departments, it is inevitable that unforeseen expenditure will have to be incurred. Indeed, already items have been noted which will encroach seriously upon this reserve. For example, the Army are now being asked to accept as a debit to their ration a substantial portion of the cost of the Haifa-Baghdad road, and it is also claimed that the permanent accommodation of the 2 internal security battalions in Palestine should fall on Army funds. These two items alone would entail a totally unexpected charge of between  1 and  2 millions.  70If further demands are made on the Army which the Government decide must be met (e.g., a further extension of A.D.G.B. or additional expenditure on Air Raids Precautions), the money could only be found by an increase to the Army ration. It must also be emphasized that the present figures allow nothing for changes in policy such as, e.g., an alteration in the relation between the British and Indian establishments or the subsidizing, at the expense of Army Funds, of the Army in India.(10) With these cuts the total of our defence requirements programme will be reduced from  347 millions in CP. 24 (38) to a new total of  277 millions. May I now have authority to work to this figure as the total of the capital programme ? This figure is based as far as possible on the prices applicable to 1938 Estimates, and I would not propose to depart from it unless future variations in, prices make this essential.   Will you confirm your approval ?I take it that when the new total has been approved we may plan our production on the assumption that the principles have been approved and that T.I.S.C will give us rapid authority to proceed with the individual items of the programme. I also take it that we should aim at concentrating this expenditure in as short a time as possible.  Do you confirm this ? , ...
