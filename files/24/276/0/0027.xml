No,  100/38,C, k 3 I N E/T.ij3mA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government, of India, dated 21st April,  1938,Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India,
-   ? ^ qConfidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India,  dated the 21st April,  1938,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State- for India.1.      Provincial Ministries.      A change of Government occurred in Sind on the resignation of the Ministry on March 21st,  after a defeat in the Legislature during the voting of budget demands.      The Ministry fell through the defection of a group of their supporters whose dissatisfaction with the late Premier seems to have been personal rather than political.      The result however has been to give a Congress tinge to the Government.      Though the Congress Party in a house of 60 numbers only 8, . it has the advantage of unity and discipline.      The new Cabinet under the Premiership of Khan Bahadur Allah Bakhsh Muhammad Umar, 0 .B J8 consists as before of 2 Moslems and 1 Hindu,      It commands a total following of about 22 and its dependence on Congress favour is indicated, by its adoption of the Congress scale of Ministers&apos; emoluments and a demand for the release of Sindrs only terrorist prisoner (known as  &quot;Wireless&quot; on account of the mechanical ingenuity lie has shown in terrorist activity).-Elsewhere some Congress ministries have, had-to face strong criticism.      It is perhaps not mere coincidence thatministries which have shown so. keen a desire to release a -&apos;&quot; &apos;a a a v&quot;political&quot; prisoners should have strayed, from propriety in their attitude to convicts of other classes.      In the Central Provinces there have been angry demonstrations- over the action of the  (Moslem) Low Minister in releasing prematurely a Moslem (an Inspector of schools at the time of the offence) convicted of the rape of a young Hinda girl.      The Minister was already unpopular.      His colleagues at first showed an inclination to. -throw him overboard:    but it would have
240been difficult to find another Moslem, to replace him and this no doubt decided the Ministry to stand by him on his -making an&apos;abject apology.      Agitation continued to some extent on communal recognisances j    the Congress Working Committee took the matter up and have referred it to a -retired High Court Judge for opinion.      The incident has shown the diffidence of Congress leaders in tackling questions in which their Moslem followers are interested.-In Bombay the Home Minister has been severely . criticised for suspending the execution of a sentence passed on two business men -- well to do,  and said to be Congress supporters.      The pretext given was to enable them to put their affairs in order &quot;before going to prison.      In the North West Frontier Province the Premier has reinstated an official who &quot;was convicted of complicity in the abduction of a Hindu girl.      This incident,  somewhat similar to that in the Central Provinces,  has roused same feeling and has brought on the Premier a rebuke from the Working Committee,Elsewhere the administration of the Provincial Ministries calls for little notice except In the matter mentioned in later paragraphs, ,   In Bengal intrigue has been busy to supplant the Ministry by one&apos;more amenable .to Congress,  and the Premier has publicly alleged that during . recent months repeated overtures have &quot;been made to him to form a Congress Coalition Cabinet.      The Bengal Congress Party is so hopelessly divided that the Ministry has little to foar from attack or intrigue in that quarter at present.A ministerial crisis has just arisen, in Orissa.      The Governor is  shortly going on leave and a very Senior Official of the Province has been designated to officiate for him. The Ministry objected on the ground, that it is: improper to place over Ministers as Governor a person, -who has been
2&amp; 1subordinate to them;    and the Congress Working .Committee&apos; has demanded the cancellation of the appointment,;     At the moment .it appears that the deadlock can only be ended by the acquiescence, or the resignation of the Ministry,2,______rhp^^C^njarj^ss,,Party ,t     The Working Committee met atCalcutta from April 1st to April 6th.      Apart from what has been mentioned above no decision of importance was announced.      It is believed that they were much troubled, by the communal situation especially the recent riots in the United Provinces.They have shown their determination to control the provincial ministries even in trifles by forbidding a projected visit to England (in order to study Parliamentary practice) by the Speaker of the Madras Assembly.      The reason given was the undesinability of thereby appearing ta accept -the new Constitutions    but the decision may have been influenced by the Speo,ker&apos;s intention to fravel at Government expense first class and with a servant.Evidence of further repression of the left wing comes from a report that, members of the All-India Congress Committee will not in future bo allowed, to remain on the executive of any non-Congress organisation e,g., the Socialist Party nor to criticise the Working Committee Ts decisions in public.      Mr, S.C. Bose, the new President, has -failed to. impress his colleagues in the Working Committee or to fulfil the hopes which the Left Wing formed of him.Z.    Terrorist prisoners.    Mr, Gandhi has spent some time in Bengal where he &apos; has. haNd interviews with the Governor, andl with the Home Minister, and with a number of convicts and detenus the gaining of whose early release was the ostensible purpose of his visit.      Ee is not satisfied.with the success of his efforts but has announced that he will continue them.
Meantime there is a clangor of a renewed hunger-strike by -terrorist prisoners in Bengal jails.Some outrages have recently occurred which seem to indicate a revival of sporadic terrorism.      They have not yet been detected,  am  it is; not possible to say whether they are the work of any of the terrorists recently released.      In the United   Provinces,  a band of daeoits,  armed With revolvers, held up and robbed a train;    and in Bihar a motor car was held up by armed robbers, who engaged the police with firearms:.4.    Communal,      Towards the end of the observance of the two festivals of Iviuharram and lioli,  serious rioting in the united Provinces resulted in a number of deaths and injuries.      At Allahabad, the  police had to- open fire,  and though peace was temporarily restored, fresh disturbances broke out on April 11th, when 2 more persons were killed. The Congress ministry gave full support to the measures adopted by local officials to restore order.      At- Hissar, in the Punjab, the second Hindu-Moslem riot within 2 months occurred, and 5 persons were killed.      In Bombay city on April 17th,  a trivial incident led to serious communal disorder, to suppress which the police had to&apos;open fire.      8 persons were killed in the course of the riots -and some 70 injured.In an article written at the end of March, Mr,  Gandhi pointed to trouble In the United Provinces as proof of the fact that Congress is not yet capable of governing according to^its own principles;    his suggestion for enrolling an army of non-violent peacemakers for quelling riots has met with little enthusiasm.The Shahidganj dispute in Lahore, mentioned in the last appreciation,  is still unsettled.      The  attempt to introduce
legislation which would have upset the High Court &apos;s decision was frustrated-by the Governor, who used the power which he enjoys under the Government of India Act to refuse sanction im- the introduction of a bill whieh-seelcs to interfere with rights in land.      Though the Governor&apos;s action was taken &quot;in- his discretion&quot;, the premier in a courageous speech in Assembly made it clear that it had complete approval of ministry.      The speech, with its earnest appeal for a settlement of this bitter and stubborn dispute, has been well received everywhere:    but it remains to find the solution.The Moslem League began a special session at Calcutta on April 17th.      Mr.  Jinnah, the President, is reported to have been in correspondence with Pandit Nehru about the possibility of a Congress-League rapprochementj    the correspondence has not been published but Mr.  JinnahTs demands are said to have been increased to a point wholly    -unacceptable to Congress;    and his opening address at the &apos;session showed no ahatement of the League&apos;s hostility to    -Congress.      The League 1s strength is increasing,  and the chances of an agreement are receding accordingly.A new feature of the League1s activities is the formation of a Moslem League Party in the  Central Assembly under the leadership of. Mr.  Jinnah.5.      Mr.__Gandhi,      Mr. Gandhi &apos;s precarious hee.lt.ti seemsnot to have been much impaired by his activities of the last few weeks.      On.April 15th,  he met the Viceroy in Hew Delhi. The interview - the second which His Excellency has accorded tto Mr,  Gandhi - lasted an hour-&apos; and a half j    and speculation about the  subjects of. discussion has not been idle.6.      The Central Legislature.    Loth the Council of State and the Central Assembly have adjourned.      The Assembly passed two important measures;    one,  a private bill &quot;to re-
llllllirrforce the provisions of the Child Marriage Restraint Act, particularly by permitting a magistrate to step by injunction an impending^ child marriage;    the other,  an official bill to amend the law relating to the prevention and settlement  of trade disputes.      A comprehensive Motor Vehicles Bill was referred to a Select Committee.      An Income Tax Bill to provide substantial penalties for evasion and the reduction of exemptions was introduced.      Argument as to, whether this bill should be referred to  a Select Committee or circulated for opinion was settled by a compromise, whereby the bill will be circulated till August,  considered by a Committee in October,  and presented to a special session of the Assembly in &quot;November,      The Governor-General has prolonged the life of the present Assembly by one year&apos;,.For the first time in its history, the Assembly contains a womah member, Mrs.  Subbarayan having been elected on Congress ticket in a bye-election for a Madras constituency, Her husband is one of the Madras ministers.7\    Economic.    The scarcity conditions in a part of Southern India have continued!    elsewhere harvest prospects are satisfactory.8.    Waziristan.     With the advent of spring there has been, as was to be expected,  a slight deterioration in the Waziristan situation.      The Faqir of Ipi has remained in, or on the border of, Madda Ehel country,  and from there has organised a system of laying country-made bombs in,  or close to, roads in the North Waziristan.. agency,      A large number of such bombs have been discovered,  and a few have exploded, causing, in most cases, little or no damage,.     There have also been two raids in the Bannu District resulting in the kidnapping of three Hindus,  including two small children who were taken across the Afghan border and later returned.
Further action is being taken against the Madda Khel to bring home their responsibility for the activities of the Faqir of Ipi so long as he remains within their limits. South Y/aziristan is generally quiet.
