Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   December 1916.SECRET. G.-99.IMPORTATION OF LABOUR FROM ABROAD. (Previous Paper No. G.-68.)I.Note by the Secretary.THE following memorandum on the Importation of Labour from Abroad has been prepared in the Ministry of Munitions, in accordance with a request by the War Committee, on the 17th November. 1916.   (W.C.-.87, Conclusion 1.)2. The question is.treated mainly from, the point of view of the Ministry of Munitions, and only slight allusion is made to the possibility of employing imported labour for shipbuilding, dockyard labour, mining, and agriculture.M. P. A. HANKEY.December 7, 1916.II.Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions.I. Possible Sources of Supply.THE possible sources of supply of imported labour may be divided under four heads: 1. White labour from the Colonies. 2. Wrhite alien labour. 3. Chinese labour.4 Coloured labour from the Colonies and Dependencies of the British Crown.1. White Labour from the. Colonies.It is hoped that labour will be forthcoming from Australia in sufficient quantities and of a sufficiently high standard to make a valuable addition to our supply of skilled labour. Small parties of workmen have already been sent over to be trained here for work in the Australian munition factories, and the experiment has proved satisfactory.2. While Alien Labour.Enquiries have been made with regard to obtaining alien labour for munitions both through the Foreign Office and through special agents in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Holland, Italy, South America, and the United States of America. These investigations have shown that with the possible exception of Portugal, diplomatic considerations coupled with the demands of the local manufac-turers make it quite out of the question to recruit any large number of workers either skilled or unskilled. The supply of Belgians appears also to be. exhausted. Employment has been found for over 50,000 Belgians, the majority of whom have gone into munition factories. A large number of these were refugees in Holland, and others were specially brought out of Belgium by our agents. &apos;[1357]
With, regard to Portugal, it. might he possible to do something by arrangement with the Portuguese Government. Indeed, the Labour Department has already obtained a few timber workers from Portugal. But it must be remembered that the French Government is already drawing on Portugal and is likely to do so in increasing numbers. It would, therefore, be likelv to resent our intrusion in that field. Active enquiries arc, however, being prosecuted as to the possibility of obtaining unskilled labour to aid in the construction of the new explosive factory.His Majesty&apos;s Government have sanctioned the use of German prisoners for construction work, but this does not meet the demand for workers in steel works, munition factories, &amp;c, and even if the use of prisoners was extended there would still be a large demand unsatisfied.This summary of the situation makes it clear that our labour problem can only be solved by the introduction of coloured labour.3. Chinese Labour.Chinese labour has already been introduced into France, and a representative of the War Office has recently visited France to- inspect the Chinese there employed. 5,000 Chinamen have been imported and are working in thirteen groups in munition factories. The War Office representative visited two typical establishments at Harfleur and Bouen, and brought away the impression that the experiment had been a decided success. This view is supported by the fact that 10,000 additional Chinese are on their way to France, and more are being recruited. These numbers include both skilled and unskilled workmen, but it is not possible to say in what proportions, or of what degree of skill.The Chinamen appear to stand the climate fairly well. The sick rate is only about 10 per cent.This class of labour has not proved expensive, as the Chinamen were paid at the same rate as the French workmen in all respects. Deductions are made for lodging, food, &amp;c, clothing, separation allowances to the worker&apos;s family, and contributions for health insurance, and for defraying cost of passage and payments made during the voyage. The only addition to the cost as compared with French labour is the 50 francs which is given to the family of the workmen on recruiting.It would appear, therefore, that a very large source can be tapped in China, if satisfactory aarangements can be made with France and the Chinese Government. Endeavours are already being made to recruit Chinese labour for service under the Indian Government and elsewhere, and the action of the Ministry in this direction will be influenced bv the measure of success which attends these efforts. In anv event, it would be advisable to insist, on a repatriation clause, both on general grounds and:to reassure the trade-union leaders, who naturally view with distrust the introduction of any new kind of labour, unless they can be satisfied that its. introduction is only temporary and will not prejudice the future position of their own members..&apos;-&quot;4. Coloured Labour from the Colonies and Dependencies of the British Crown.This class of labour would he cheap if the leaders of labour in this country agree to a lower rate being paid to this labour than would be paid to white labour engaged on similar employment. It would probably have to be recruited on a military basis, though, if the recruiting is to be a success, it will have to be made quite clear that there is no intention, present or prospective, to send the recruits into or near the firing line.   Sources from which this kind of labour might come are : (a.) India. Skilled labour for munitions works would mainly he found in railway workshops, dockyard (Government and private), and private engineering shops. 1 here are some 100,000 hands employed on this class of work, and it is possible that a small percentage of it might be made available for use here. There are also about 400,000 skilled and semi-skilled men employed in cotton and jute mills, which might he tapped.When India is under consideration we, must always reckon with&apos; the caste question, but the following races which supply men to the engineering trades are likely to be available without serious religious and social difficulties: 1. Parsis:  They are good mechanics and there are from 3,000 to 4,000 on engineering work.2. Goanese: They are good fitters and turners and have about 5,000 to 6,000 so engaged.
3. Eurasians : These are good mechanics.   No estimate is to hand of the numbersengaged on engineering work. 4. Mahommedans: They are chiefly employed in North-Western Railway shopsand are the best mechanics in India.We wrere informed in Eebruary last that there was then no surplus of skilled labour over the requirements of Indian munition factories. Further enquiries were addressed to the India Office and we were informed last month&quot; that it is possible that a comparatively unskilled class of workmen might be employed in this country. We have sent the India Office details of our requirements and asked for further information as to the quantity aud quality of the labour available.(b.) Egypt. We are advised that it would-be feasible to get a good supply of unskilled labour from Egypt, provided that great care were taken in selecting the proper men (British and Egyptian officers) to recruit this labour and supervise it, as it is essential to avoid getting landed with the &quot; rabble &quot; of Cairo and Alexandria. No exact estimate of the numbers can be made, but we are advised that it should run into thousands without interfering in any way with military or subsidiary demands in Egypt, It is believed that the Egyptian &quot;fellah&quot; should stand the English, climate fairly well, but that the Soudanese must be excluded on this account.(c.) Africa. From South Africa a certain number of half-castes have been sent to Havre for dock labour. One thousand were taken as an experiment and 5,000 to 10,000 more were to come if it was successful. A scheme has been prepared for importing Basutos for employment on the construction of a new explosives factory. It is proposed to import 6,000 hoys in batches of 1,200 each. These boys would, if the Colonial Office and the Union Government approved, be imported from British Basutoland, and would be under white overseers, one overseer being required to thirty or forty men. They would be recruited at first for one year if possible, but would have the option to sign on from month to month after the year if their labour was required. They would be housed according to the Kimberley closed compound system, as the system of open compounds in use on the Rand is censidered to be unsuitable to English conditions.   They wrould be subject to South African law.The pay would be for each actual day&apos;s work 2s. hoi. to 3.s. a day without overtime for the boys, and 3s. i)d. to 4s. a day for native bosses. In addition, they would receive Is. a day from the date of recruitment to the day they commence work and from the date of termination of employment to the day they land in South Africa. Arrangements would be made to enable the boys to remit savings to South Africa, They would pay for their own food, blankets, clothes, &amp;c. (except one working suit and thick shirt on joining) at South African prices, but would be suppled with fuel for cooking, &amp;c. The cost of recruiting and transport is estimated at 15/. a boy. It will also be necessary to provide medical officers with South African experience, and a native nursing staff. Thus it will be seen that the scheme involves a considerable capital expenditure, though the actual weekly wages bill will be lower than if it were possible to use white labour.It is questionable whether we could draw on West Africa. The natives there are engaged largely on cocoa export, the value of which in 1914 was over 2,000,000/. sterling. Climatic considerations would present such grare difficulties that even if any men could he spared they could not be brought direct to this country or to France, and would therefore not be available for a considerable time.With regard to the aboriginal natives of South and Central Africa, it has to be remembered that a great drain on the supply is made by the demand for the labour of the Transvaal gold-fields, and no interference with this could be permitted. More-over, these natives are particularly susceptible to pulmonary attack when exposed to . temperatures to which they have not been accustomed. Locality is, therefore, a prime factor in deciding where to employ them. It would be undesirable under any circumstances to employ them in the British Isles, though they might do well in parts of France if they were introduced in summer.(d.) West Indies. Climatic consideration might make it difficult to employ labour of this kind in the United Kingdom, but enquiries are being made in this direction, especially as to Jamaica.II. Industries to which Unskilled Labour can be drafted.iIt is difficult to set out an exact statement of the numbers in which such alien labourers could be utilised, and the types of work on which they could be employed..
But the prospective demand for labour embraces such work as rough construction work, certain occupations in quarrying, overhead labouring work at coalmines and at coke ovens, handling of shells at bonds and at shipping ports, ore mining, labouring work in blast furnaces and steel works. The labour might also be advantageously used by way of substitution, to set free for military service dock labourers, labourers in the largest of the shipyards, and in the National Projectile Factories, &amp;c. Much of the labour now employed on such work is necessarily of the type and physique that is required in the Army, and is to be&apos;&quot;&apos;combed out&quot; as rapidly as substitutes can be provided.E.
