118Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1916.SECRET. G.-87.OUR FINANCIAL POSITION IN AMERICA.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.ON the 4th February, 1916, the Cabinet Committee on the Co-ordination of Military and Financial Effort reported that our financial resources were only equal to the effort then called for by the Army Council by the adoption of financial expedients which would endanger the maintenance of our national credit, and could in any case only be continued for a short period. A reduction in the programme first proposed has in fact been made. On the 19th May, 1916, I laid a statement before the Finance Committee of the Cabinet who considered that the facts disclosed a danger of our being unable to meet our liabilities in America, and that it was a matter of the first importance that future commitments should be restricted within the narrowest possible limits. In this paper I estimated our expenditure in America from the middle of May to the end of September at 795,000,000 dollars; our actual expenditure for this period was 985,000,000 dollars. It is only to the American side of our problem that [ now wish to direct attention.The above conclusions were reached by Committees of my colleagues, of which I was a member. The most recent survey of the situation,, which is printed below, has been undertaken by an outside Committee of great weight, in whose deliberations I have taken no part, and I prefer to add nothing in detail to their significant statement of the facts.On the broader aspects of the position, however, I wish to call attention to considerations, which recent events have brought home to my own mind very forcibly.What, after all, are the financial stakes we are risking ? I am not sure that the most obvious are the most important. Granted that essential civilian supplies will always be obtained somehow, and that the military authorities are prepared, with their eyes open, to take the chance of being stinted later on, provided they can have all they want for the present; Are these the only important risks involved ? My experience in the administration of my own Office suggests some other possibilities.There are two sets of circumstances, and in my opinion two only, which may deprive us of the liberty to fix for ourselves the time and terms of peace. One is the inability of a principal Ally to continue. The other is the power of the United States to dictate to us.1. In the course of the last three months I have spent more hours than* I care to recall in the company of the Finance Ministers of our Allies. Two conclusions have emerged. There is no likelihood of their furnishing us with any considerable quantity of gold beyond what is already promised. To obtain the secret gold reserve of 100,000,0001.,* mentioned in the following report, I had to exercise pressure which went dangerously far. I doubt if any further pressure could enable me to repeat the gold agreements of August and September last. On the other hand, the Ministers did not conceal that lavish and increasing financial assistance was a necessary condition of their continuance.None of the existing agreements run beyond next March, and I believe that I have made no promises so far which we cannot fulfil. But when the time comes early next spring for a further batch of financial Conferences, what will my position he if our assets in sight are already completely pledged ? So far as prolonged conferences have enabled me to judge of the atmosphere, I do not believe that large economies in our subsidies will be accepted by our Allies. But if all our liquid resources are exhausted by our own military commitments, drastic reductions in these subsidies will be the consequence.2. At all times we have been very dependent on the goodwill of the United States. But up to now I have always been able, if necessary, to last out financially any temporary wave  of adverse sentiment  or unfriendly executive action.   If the* I ought to add that I have had to spend 20,000,000Z. of this in the last fortnight as the result of a, temporary break in the American exchange and to prepare the way for the new American loan.[H81] . B
President had deprecated publicly the issue of loans to belligerents, I should have been disconcerted but not helpless, because of our considerable liquid resources in the form of gold and securities. I am still to some extent in this position. Our stock of American securities is much depleted, but our gold would enable us to last three months if necessary without a public issue in America. After the end of this year We shall never be in that position again. At the same time, the degree of our dependency makes a great deal of difference. We ought never to be so placed that only a public issue in America within a fortnight stands between us and insolvency. Yet we are quickly drifting in this direction. I call special attention to the passage of the following report, in which it is pointed out that, while in recent months we have depended on loans for only two-fifths of our American expenditure (and, I may add, on public issues in the United States for only one-quarter of it), we shall require henceforward to meet from this source five-sixths of an increased total. If things go on as at present, I venture to say with certainty that by next J une or earlier the President of the American Republic will be in a position, if he wishes, to dictate his own terms to us.R. McE.Uth October, 1916.EXTRACT FROM THE REPORT OF THE BRITISH MEMBERS OF THE JOINT ANGLO-FRENCH FINANCIAL COMMITTEE.* * *4. The most important results of the Committee&apos;s deliberations arose out of a prolonged and detailed examination which they undertook, in consultation with the principal members of the firm of Messrs. J. P. Morgan, into the financial position and prospects of the Allied Powers, and more particularly of the United Kingdom, in the United States of America.The situation disclosed by this examination is of so serious a character that we desire to record the following conclusions as deserving the immediate attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government.5. In the five months May to September 1916 the expenditure of the British Treasury in America has amounted to 1,038,000,000 dollars, being at the rate of 207,500,000 dollars a month. This expenditure has been met to the extent of three-fifths by the sale of gold and British-owned American securities, and to the extent of two-fifths by loans.6. A conservative estimate of the coming expenditure for the six months October 1916 to March 1917 gives a total of 1,500,000,000 dollars, being at the rate of 250,000,000 dollars a month. This estimate makes no allowance for further orders now in course of arrangement or in contemplation by the Ministry of Munitions. Further, the experience of the last few weeks (though it must be remembered that we are now at the worst season of the year) has shown that the allowance included in this estimate as required for the support of the commercial exchanges may be below the mark to the extent of 100,000,000 dollars, or even more. And lastly, the estimate assumes that there will.be no further diminution in the capacity of this country to furnish its own products and manufactures to the other Allies, and that the latter will continue to be pressed to place any orders, which are to be financed out of British credits, here rather than in America.It must, however, be added that increased expenditure anywhere, including this country, by ourselves or by the Allies, tends to affect the American Exchange adversely, inasmuch as the sums so paid in London are likely in present circumstances to be remitted to New York to pay for goods purchased from the United States, if not by ourselves, by those neutrals to whom we owe money. As we are supporting the American exchanges at a level relatively higher than that of the other principal neutral exchanges,&apos; the entire adverse balance of trade of the British Empire and the Allies tends to be settled over New York.7. Assets to meet this expenditure can in the main only be found from the sale of British-owned American securities, from gold, and from loans (this term including bank credits and the proceeds of bills).The first of these resources, which has yielded 300,000,000 dollars in the last five months, must be regarded as negligible for the future. The small amount of American securities still in hand, or to be obtained, will be more fruitfully employed to render palatable to the American investor a much larger proportion of non-American securities, as our collateral for ensuing loans.
Including the promises recently extracted from Prance and Russia, the Treasury have built up a secret reserve in gold amounting to nearly 100,000,0001 We should regard it as very imprudent to exhaust this ultimate reserve, which cannot he replaced, until the end of the war is in sight. On the other hand, it will not be practicable, even in favourable circumstances, to retain more than half of this reserve by the 31st March next; and we must expect to disburse at least 50,000,0001 (or 250,000,000 dollars) to the United States in the course of the next six months.&apos; 8. this leaves a deficit of 1,250,000,000 dollars to be met by the issue of loans in America. That is to say, five-sixths of our current expenditure in America hence-forward must be met out of Ameriean loans, as compared with two-fifths during the past five months. Or, to take aggregate figures, we have to borrow 1,250,000,000 dollars before the 31st March, 1917, as compared with actual borrowings of 400,000,000 dollars in the past five months, being at the rate of more than 200,000,000 dollars a month as compared with 80,000,000 dollars a month.Yet to obtain 80,000,000 dollars a month has required the most persistent efforts.9. A loan of 50,000,000 dollars has been already promised by the Government of Canada; and we must hope that a further 50,000,000 dollars may be obtainable from this source in the spring. There remain 1,150,000,000 dollars to be borrowed in the United States.10. Our French colleagues expressed great concern at the possibility of our being required to provide collateral security against the whole sum to be borrowed. But even in this contingency, which we hope may be avoided, we do not on this score see any ground for special anxiety. Our French colleagues are influenced by a more vivid appreciation of the limitations of their own resources in this kind than of the abundance of ours. Provided the American lenders will be satisfied with a smaller proportion of American securities than hitherto, an event which we have reason to anticipate, we can continue to supply collateral security of a high class to meet our requirements up to the 31st March at least. When our existing American securities are exhausted, the hope would be that we might satisfy the American investor by non-American collateral supported by a very ample margin. It is Jiot, however, so much in this direction that we look for the most immediate danger as in that indicated in section 13.11. We exposed to the representatives of Messrs. J. P. Morgan our need for 1,500,000,000 dollars before the end of next March, and Mr. John Morgan and Mr. H. P. Davison were closely interrogated on every relevant aspect of it. This figure was communicated to them for the first time, and they did not conceal their dismay. Mr. Davison had been aware that the aggregate figures had grown very large, but he had not realised that so much would be required in so short a time. &quot; Your confidential information as to requirements of Allied Governments is staggering. It is far from clear how they can possibly be met . . . .,&quot; was cabled by their New York House on the 10th October. &quot;The money required,&quot; said Mr. Davison, &quot; is more than, or as much as, exists. We must get at the business anyway and everyway which is creditable and will bring money. Every possible device has got to be availed of.&quot; The following dialogue at the close of our discussion with Messrs. Morgan perhaps indicates the position more exactly than any formal statement: Lord Reading (to Mr. John Morgan). Do you see your way to financing this 1,500,000,000 dollars by the 31st March ? &quot;Mr. J ohn Morgan-No. I don&apos;t see the way. But we are taking too long a view of this thing.   We don&apos;t have to pay it all now.Lord Reading. Mo. But we have also to look beyond the 31st March. Iam not asking exactly how it is to be met. But, in your own minds, with every possible expedient, do you see your way to carrying us through to the 31st March ?Mr. Morgan. Thatfs an awful question.Lord Reading. May I change the question ? In your judgment, do you think that, somehow or other, the monev will be found by the 31st March ?Mr. Morgan.--Yes.   It will be found somehow, or payments will he sufficiently postponed (meaning by temporary bank overdrafts).. Mr. Davison.-On the first day of April the Allies will not be in a discredited position and will still be paying their way.Mr. Morgan-All devices must be used.
Mr. Morgan added that the problem of meeting the situation must be left largely in the hands of his firm, in view of the amount to be obtained within a brief period.12&apos;. If our expenditure were coming to an end on the 31st March such a statement would be comparatively satisfactory; but, as we have to provide beyond the 31st March, even for existing commitments, it is disquieting. Our financial agents tell us in effect that, by the use of every available device, and possibly at the cost of postponing payments by bank overdrafts, we shall still be solvent on the 31st March. They cannot tell us how this result is to be achieved, but they hope and believe it will be possible. As time goes on the American market may grow more accustomed to digest foreign loans, and we may also hope for assistance to our credit from an improved military situation. But, nevertheless, we shall start the next half-year with our devices exhausted, the American market congested with our issues, our account in debit, and our gold reserves diminished by one-half at least.13. This leads us to the principal and dominating conclusion which as the result of our recent conferences overshadows in our minds all other considerations.The problem of paying our way in America is mainly one of the possible pace of borrowing. In its practical aspect it is not a question of our credit, or of our capacity to put up security, or of the confidence of the Americans in the success of the Allies or of their sympathy with us though without any one of these favouring influences we should be in great difficulties. On these heads we must take any risk that may exist.The question is whether the money can be turned over in America and brought back to us in the form of loans as fast as we are spending it. Between each loan and the next we live on an overdraft with our bankers. Each time the overdraft grows heavier, and the longest interval which we can spare between the successive loans grows less. The maximum overdraft we can secure is limited by the financial capacity of New York and by the peculiar banking laws of the United States. A time will come when the overdraft has reached its maximum before it is by any means practicable to secure the issue of a further loan.Given time, we could probably borrow all we want. The question is wdiether the rate at which our commitments are falling due will give us time.14. We considered the suggestion that the industrial and financial world of America is now so deeply committed to the Allied cause, that it cannot afford to let us fall into difficulties. There is force in this contention. But it must not be pushed too far. We believe that this factor will enable us to obtain some supplies, and will prevent us from being left entirely and absolutely without resources, even Avhen we cannot find means of immediate payment. But if pushed beyond this point it is fraught with the gravest danger. We cannot expect that these influences will induce the United States to finance anything approaching the total requirements of ourselves and our Allies.Our financial requirements have got far beyond any total which can be met by the great capitalist interests, whose liquid resources are much less than in this country, and who are not all of them good friends of ours. We have to look beyond these interests to the great investing public, not only on the Atlantic seaboard, but in the Middle and Ear Western States, where the European War is a distant and unrealised adventure. Those upon whose money we must depend are not only or even chiefly the same as those with whom we place our orders. The New York capitalists can provide only a fraction of what we require. The problem is whether the general public can be induced to subscribe to our loans at a pace equal to our expenditure. To raise the interest payable would not serve us, as such action, by provoking suspicion of our credit, might diminish the proceeds of our loans and could not materially increase them.15. Large sums are at present expended by the Treasury in maintaining the purchasing power of the   sterling in terms of the dollar. This expenditure is the pivot of our whole financial policy and the foundation of our credit in all parts of the world. By supporting the American exchange we limit the possible depreciation of all the other neutral exchanges. And as the exchanges of the other Allies on London are also supported, the purchasing power of every member of the Alliance is maintained in all parts of the world. If this policy was suspended, such suspension involving as it must a prohibition of the export of gold, with the consequent demorali-sation of all our exchanges, nevertheless some funds would still be forthcoming in America and other neutral countries at a price. It is not to be supposed that a country of the wealth of the United Kingdom can ever become in any literal sense bankrupt.   But there is a great difference between being able to obtain moderate
sums at a high price and being able to satisfy successfully the unexampled demands which the efficient prosecution of the war by the Alliance as a whole now entails. The latter position is only possible so long as our credit is unquestioned and we can maintain the appearance of having at our command a sufficiency of liquid resources.16. In short, desperate expedients may always keep us supplied with some resources.  But they certainly will not yield to us or our Allies all we want.&quot;Without venturing to prophesy the exact term for which we can hope to meet the present rate of expenditure, we believe that the problem of how long our immediately available resources will hold out, and consequently of how they can be utilised most wisely, is now one of pressing, practical importance.The seriousness of the situation as it is now developing cannot be more vividly illustrated than by the statement that, out of the 5,000,000X which the Treasury have to find daily for the prosecution of the war, nearly 2,000,000/. has to be found in America.READING.
