Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1916.SECRET.G-88. 2MERCHANT  SHIPPING.Memorandum by the President oe the Board oe Trade.The memorandum which I am circulating on merchant shipping puts in a condensed form the main aspects of the numerous problems affected by the daily growing shortage of tonnage.   I have shown that: 1. Our shipbuilding is not keeping pace with our losses.2. Although the number of our vessels is down, the demands on our tonnage arenot diminished.   Amongst other influences, distant expeditions require morevessels rather than less. . 3. The withdrawal of 200 steamers from the service of the naval and militaryauthorities which was recommended by the Shipping Control Committee andordered by the War Committee has not been effected. 4. The failure of the wheat crop in America and the necessity of bringing overwheat from Australia calls for an unavoidable use of tonnage in a lesseconomical manner than last season if our people are to be fed. 5. We cannot bring about a further reduction of imports by direct prohibition,so that a further ease of the strain on shipping by that means is not tobe anticipated.6. We must depend more and more on neutral ships for our existence, and mustcontinue to make our routes more attractive to them. 7. By commercial means, and by maintaining the supplies of labour in the ports,we must turn the vessels round more expeditiously.W. R.October 26, 1916.I. Survey of Present Position.THE following figures show the variations that have taken place in the number and tonnage of British ocean-going steamers on the register that is, steamers of over 1,600 tons gross since the outbreak of war: In July 1914 there were 3,888 ships, of 16,841,519 tons gross.By the end of September 1915 there had been added to the list 350 ships of 1,667,399 tons; removed from the list, 365 ships, of 1,492,616 tons, i.e., a decrease of 15 ships and an increase of 174,783 tons. The list then contained 3,873 ships, of 17,016,302 tons gross.By the ISth September, 1916, there had been added to the list 116 ships, of 600,327 tons; removed from the list, 347 ships, of 1,361,389 tons, i.e., a decrease of 231 ships, of 761,062 tons, so that there were 3,642 ships, of 16,255,240 tons gross.During the first of these two periods, the volume of British tonnage was main-tained, largely owing to the addition to our register of enemy interned and captured ships. The figures for the second period show that we are no longer keeping pace with our losses.A considerable proportion of these vessels is, of course, not available for ordinary trading purposes. Periodical returns are prepared by the Transport Department of the Admiralty, giving the position in detail of British ships of 1,600 gross tons and. upwards, excluding oilers and vessels locked up in the Baltic or Black Sea, or Qru?^Se n0t availaole for ocean-going trade or requisition. The return for the 30th September, 1916, shows that on that date there were 3,536 ships available, 7b2 being passenger vessels, and 2,774 being car^o vessels.[1194] B
These vessels may he classified as follows:-	Passenger Ships.	Cargo Ships.	TotaL1. Vessels requisitioned :		;	(a.) For British Naval and Military purposes	253	,   614	867(b.)

Vessels trading on behalf of Australia, India, and Egypt		46	468. Other vessels at present free from Admiralty requisition trading			under license of the Ship Licensing Committee   ...	500	1,154	1,654Total   ..         ..         ..         ..         * *	762	2,774	3,536It will he seen, therefore, that out of a total of 3,536 vessels 1,123, or 31&apos;76 per cent., are under requisition for British naval and militarypurposes, and for Allied Governments. . 759,, or 21/46 per cent., are under requisition or direct control for specifiedpurposes.1,6$4, or 46*78 per cent,, are free to trade under licence from the Ship Licensing Committee.Erom the point of view of the trade of this country, the position of the cargo vessels is of course of primary importance.   Of a total of 2,774 cargo vessels 867, or 31-25 per cent., are under requisition for British naval and militarypurposes, and for Allied Governments. 753, or 27*14 per cent., are under requisition&quot;or direct control for specified purposes. 1,154, or 41*61 per cent., are free to trade under licence from the Ship LicensingCommittee.Of the 1,154 &quot;free&quot; cargo ships, 297, or about one-quarter, are trading abroad. Apart, therefore, from what is being done by the wheat and sugar ships and temporarily released ships, there is only about 30 per cent, of the total number of British cargo vessels available for the general trade of this country.(i.) Tonnage requisitioned for British Naval and Military Purposes.&apos;In January 1916 the shortage of merchant-shipping tonnage led to a further stiffening in the control of shipping and to the appointment of the Shipping Control Committee.The urgent necessity for freeing from requisition as much tonnage as possible became more and more clear during the course of the winter. In their letter of the 31st March to the Prime Minister, the Shipping Control Committee recommended &quot; the withdrawal of 200 steamers from the service of the naval and military authorities, and the placing of these vessels at the disposal of the general carrying trade.&quot; On the 28th April the War Committee decided that it should be an instruction to the Admiralty and War Office to submit at an early date a programme for reducing their j requirements of merchant-ships by a total of about 200 ships.As the result of action taken by the naval and military authorities, the number of requisitioned ships for British naval and military purposes was reduced from 933 on the 29th June to 865 on the 31st August. On the 30th September the figure stood at 867. The Director of Transports estimated in July last that 54 further ships would be required for the Salonica Expedition. It would appear from the figures given above that it has been found possible to counterbalance this increase by economies in the use of requisitioned tonnage in other directions. It is to be hoped that the efforts to release requisitioned ships will not be relaxed, but in any attempt to forecast the future it would be unsafe to count on any reduction under this heading.
(ii.) Tonnage for the Allies.During last winter the demands of France and Italy for tonnage became more and more insistent. It became necessary to make it clear to them that the supply of British shipping was not inexhaustible, and on the 25th April the War Committee approved a recommendation of the Shipping Control Committee that it should be pointed out to France and Italy that no British shipping could be allotted to them beyond the shipping already in their service. At the same time the urgency of Russian requirements made it necessary to allocate about 100 additional steamers to that service. Since that date the amount of British tonnage in the service of the Allies has not altered materially.On the 30th September, 1916, the amount was as follows :  -	France.	Italy.	Russia.	Other Allies.	Total.Requisi tioned ships        ... Ships trading on behalf of the Allies	98 225	17 75	C138 24	n O 1	256 325	323	92	162	4	581These figures are exclusive of vessels engaged in carrying wheat to France and Italy. It is to be hoped that these totals will continue to be treated as maxima and, further, that as many as possible of the vessels in Russian service will be returned to United Kingdom trade during the months when Archangel is closed.(iii.) Ships requisitioned for Sugar.The number of ships in the service of the Sugar Commission has risen from fifty-seven on the 1st February to seventy-one on the 30th September last. The present increase is due to the fact that sugar is being obtained from Java, in the interval between the crops in the&apos; West. The number will begin to decrease during November, and will reach its minimum when the new crop from Cuba begins to come forward.(iv.) Vessels requisitioned for the Carriage of Ore, Timber, and Flax.The Board of Trade understand that it would not be safe to count on any material saving of tonnage under this heading.(v.) Vessels temporarily released to their Owners.The policy of the Transport Department in releasing temporarily vessels which for the time being are not required for Government Service is obviously to the public advantage. The number of vessels so released must depend upon naval and military requirements, and any increase of the present number cannot be counted upon.(vi.) Vessels trading on behalf of Australia, India, and Egypt.The number of British vessels in this category has increased from thirty-seven on the 29th January, 1916, to forty-six on the 30th September. No saving of tonnage under this heading can be expected.(vii.) Vessels engaged in the Carriage of Wheat.As the wheat harvest has failed in North and South America, all the wheat available in Australia has to be brought to market. It is estimated,that on balance the ships of 25,000 quarters capacity employed in the carriage of wheat for the whole twelve months 1916-17 wiU exceed those similarly, employed in 1915-16
Aby eigh,ty-two. Even when the whole of the estimated world&apos;s crop of wheat has been brought to market, the requirements of the world will be unsatisfied to the extent of 10 per cent., and a further forty ships will be required for the whole twelve months to bring other grain in substitution for the wheat to the European market.The total extra demand on tonnage for wheat or substituted grain comes out at about an additional 122 steamers of 25,000 quarters capacity for twelve months&apos; service, and it must not be forgotten that a larger number of steamers must be allotted if the time of their service is reduced. It must be remembered also that the Australian service is peculiar by reason of the great distances involved, and the number of vessels which can economically perform the service is limited.The wheat position of 1916-17 throws, therefore, a great additional strain on the world&apos;s tonnage, and particularly on one section of the cargo tonnage.Summary of Survey of directly controlled Ships.The foregoing survey leads to the conclusion that there is no certainty of any permanent reduction o? the number of vessels required in any of the categories of directly controlled ships. On the other hand, the shortage of the American wheat crop has forced upon us what in other circumstances would be a most wasteful use of tonnage. The inevitable result must be a most serious drain on the supply of merchant shipping available for the general trade of the country. This drain will come at the season when the flow of supplies to the United Kingdom is always at its highest level, for it has been estimated that under normal conditions the imports, divided in&apos;weight, are approximately as follows : Quarter October to December .. .. ..     31 per cent, of the years imports.January to March .. ..26 ,, ,,April to June.. .. .. .. ..22        ,, ,,July to September .. .. 21        ,, ,,100&quot;We are face to face with an unexampled strain on our merchant shipping in the busiest season. This will inevitably be increased through loss by enemy action.II-How is the Shortage oe Merchant Shipping to be Reduced?Merchant Shipbuilding.In normal times the wastage of shipping is made up, and more than made up, by building. This is no longer possible. The following figures show the course of merchant shipbuilding since the commencement of the war: Steam Vessels of 100 Tons Gross and upwards.	Vessels Commenced.

As compared with the deliveries- of new vessels, the losses of merchant-shipsexcluding fishing vessels, from  the commencement of   the   war up   to   the30th September, 1916, have been as follows :- .1 Gross tonnage.By enemy action .. .. .. - - * * &quot;By ordinary marine risks.. .. .. .. **       6 i 6,161, Total...... ..     2,211,261It will be seen from the above figures that from the commencement, of the war the rate of merchant shipbuilding steadily declined, until at the end of March 1916 it was in sight of something approaching to a complete stoppage. Since that date action on the part of the Board of Trade, assisted by the Admiralty, has resulted in a recovery in the rate of building. Even at the present rate merchant shipbuilding is far from being able to perform its normal function, and difficulties which have recently arisen threaten to put a stop to the improvement which has been effected.1. Material. The outstanding difficulty is the very serious shortage of steel, which is due to the enormous requirements of steel for munitions. An arrangement was made some time ago under which the Admiralty undertook to look after the supplies of steel required for all merchant shipbuilding which was declared war work. This arrangement has worked well, but the demands of the Ministry of Munitions are now so considerable that its success is endangered. A definite understanding safeguarding merchant shipbuilding supplies is urgently required. Otherwise all the efforts of the Board of Trade and Admiralty will be nullified.2. Labour. Scarcity of labour in the shipyards and especially in the marine engine shops has been, and still remains, a serious check on the delivery of ships. The Ministry of Munitions and Board of Trade have been endeavouring to make up the shortage, and no effort to this end should be spared.3. Extra Cost. The difficulty of extra cost was for some time a stumbling-block, but this has now been removed in almost every case through negotiations by an official of the Marine Department of the Board of Trade.Vessels under Requisition or Allocated to the Allies.It was found possible during last summer to effect an appreciable reduction in the number of ships under requisition for British naval and military purposes. It is essential that the use to which each of these ships is put should be rigorously and continuously scrutinised, and that as many ships as possible should be released for general trade.There has been complaint as to wasteful use of transport tonnage by the Australian Government. It is understood that the Shipping Control Committee have suggested measures for securing the better use of these ships, and it is to be hoped that these will be carried into effectA careful watch should be kept on the movement of vessels in the service of the Allies and on the uses to which they are put.Wheat Ships.An immediate arrangement with Erance and Italy is under discussion to secure that, by co-ordinated action, the mileage covered bv shipping in bringing over the three countries&apos; wheat supplies is reduced to a minimum.Restriction of Imports.In order to save tonnage it was decided last Eebruary to embark on a policv of restricting imports. The list of articles, the importation of which is prohibited except under licence, has now run to a great length, the Output of Beer (Eestric-tion) Act has also effected a reduction in the imports of brewing materials.The full effect of the restrictions has not yet been experienced, but it is estimated that the total annual saving will amount to something between 1,500,000 and 1,800,000 tons weight of imports.After careful enquiry, the Board of Trade are of opinion that it is not practicable to bring about any further material reduction of unessential imports by the instru-ment of direct prohibition. A further reduction will be secured indirectly by high prices, by the gradual cessation of unessential industries in this country (owing to withdrawal of labour, &amp;c), and by the very fact of the shortage of ships.11194 j C
Neutral Ships.One-third of our imports comes in foreign bottoms, and we must increase this proportion by every means in our power.Apart from the chartering of foreign vessels by British merchants and others, the Marine Department of the Board of Tracje have already . chartered about 150 neutral ships, which are being mainly employed in.the service of France and Italy. The rates of hire are naturally high, but the policy of time-chartering will be continued.Our control of bunkering facilities is being used to bring neutral vessels into trades useful to the Allies. The weapon is one which might be broken if not used with some degree of caution, but the control is being steadily strengthened with good results.German Ships seized by Portugal.Some slight alleviation may be expected when these vessels are in full employ-ment. They are seventy-four in number, with a gross tonnage of 244,500. Portugal will retain about a fifth of this tonnage for her own trade, and it is proposed to divide the remainder equally between the United Kingdom, Prance, and Italy. Owing to the necessity of repairing them and to delays on the part of the Portuguese, the ships are getting to work rather slowly, but we are doing our best to expedite them.Congestion at the Ports.By commercial means and by maintaining the supplies of labour in our ports, every possible step should be taken to turn the vessels round expeditiously and thus to increase the value of our tonnage.According to an estimate made by Sir Norman Hill, the shipping employed in the carriage of the imports of the United Kingdom during August and September last is shown by the following figures. The standard in times of peace has been taken as 100 :-Shipping Tonnage . entered with Cargoes in Ports of the United Kingdom.Month.

It is based on the ascertained weights of about 88 per cent, of the total imports. So far as food is concerned, it is based on about 95 per cent, of the total food imports :-Cargo Tonnage Imported into the United Kingdom.Month.

The rather startling reduction in September, both in shipping and in imports, may be due to temporary fluctuations of the markets, but it is clear that the amount of commercial work which has recently had to be handled at our ports is much less than in normal times.It is significant that returns obtained by the Port and Transit Executive Committee show that no port claims to be able to give more than a normal rate of discharge to the ships, and many of them report a rate considerably below normal. The Port and Transit Committee attribute this primarily to the insufficiency and inefficiency of labour, the inefficiency being due to so many of the younger men having been taken for war purposes. In view of the fact that the available labour at the ports has with difficulty handled the work in an unusually slack period, it is clear that urgent action is necessary if our ports are not to be blocked during the busier season now commencing.In January 1916, the Cabinet Committee dealing with the Co-ordination of Military and Financial Effort advised the War Office that the suggestion made by the Port and Transit Executive Committee to call upon the army to supply the additional emergency labour required for work at the docks is* of the utmost importance, and should, as far as practicable, be acceded to without delay. After an interval of four months a weak battalion was placed at the disposal of the Committee and, even at the present time, it is only up to the strength of about 1,000. Despite its limited resources, the battalion has been a success. It has been at work at seventeen different ports where there was a danger of congestion, without any friction with labour. It has been of great assistance to the Ministry of Munitions in the discharge of iron ore cargoes, which are disliked by civilian labour. The fact that the services of this battalion were available has also on occasion served as a check on labour trouble in the ports.The battalion has passed beyond the experimental stage, and additional battalions should be formed now with a total strength of at least 10,000 men. There does not appear to be any reason why these battalions should not be formed out of trained men in the home service battalions without interfering with home defence. Large numbers of soldiers were allowed to be scattered all over the country in order to gather in the harvest. The transport workers&apos; battalions would be much more readily available for military duties, and it is upon the rapid flow of traffic through the ports that the country is dependent for four-fifths of its wheat supplies.The home service battalions are the only available source from which a reinforce-ment of dock labour can be obtained, and, without some substantial reinforcement, the condition of the ports is likely in the near future to be a serious embarrassment not only to the civilian population, but to the supply of munitions and other urgent military requirements.W.
