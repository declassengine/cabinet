Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1916.SECRET.OBSERVATIONS BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY ON THE PRIME MINISTER&apos;S NOTE (G.-57) ON NAVAL POLICY, DATED THE 22nd FEBRUARY, 1916.&quot; 1. THE Grand Fleet is perilously deficient in destroyers, mine-sweepers, and light cruisers.&quot;It is undoubtedly true that under all three heads the Grand Fleet is deficient. To say that it is &quot; perilously deficient&quot; is, I hope, an over-statement. In any case it is less deficient than in the earlier stages of the war.The figures are as follows : Jan. 1, 1915.     Feb. 24, 1916.Destroyers ... ... ... 41 70Mine-sweepers ... ... ... 9 16Light cruisers ... ... ... 9 15Attached cruisers ... ... ... 7 5Flotilla leaders ... ... ... 3 5&quot; 2. The tables prepared by the Admiralty show that the Allied navies have an overwhelming superiority in destroyers and light cruisers over the combined enemy navies.&quot;&quot;3. The question of distribution in the case of all three classes of craft (a) asbetween the Allied fleets, (6) in our own, requires urgent consideration inview of the safety and efficiency of the Grand Fleet.&quot; &quot; 4. For the purpose of 3 (a), a conference between the Admiralties or Admirals ofthe Allied fleets should be held without delay, at which we ought to claimthe predominant voice.&quot;This statement in 12 is perfectly true, and if the respective navies were pitted against one another in an open fight, the Germans would without doubt be completely crushed. The difficulty in which we find ourselves placed arises, not from the fact that the Allies are numerically inferior to the enemy in these, or indeed in any classes of ships, but that while the Germans can concentrate all their smaller craft in the North Sea and in the Baltic, to aid in the operations of their High Sea Fleet, the Allied navies have not only to be prepared to fight this fleet, but also to police the waterways of the world. It may be taken as certain that the Japanese will not send any important contingent of their fleet to western waters. It is not less certain that the French, Italians, and Russians will do nothing to help us in the North Sea. We are bound by contract to lend four light cruisers to the Italians, and there is not the slightest chance of their consenting to modify the bargain.There can be no great harm in a conference between the Admiralties of the Allied fleets as proposed in g 4; and the scene would not be without its humours. When these high officials were called together and realised that. they were to lend ships to Britain instead of borroioing ships from her, there would, after the first moment of stupefaction was passed, be an inimitable exhibition of eloquent indignation at the proposed reversal of the accustomed rdles. I do not suggest that they would be right. Yet this much, at all events, they could truthfully urge : that after we had provided for the Mediterranean 8 light cruisers, 4 scouts, 20 sloops, 28 destroyers, 14 torpedo boats, 300 trawlers and drifters, besides other small craft, the Mediterranean was still insufficiently protected, and more were still required.I take it, then, that the problem of distribution as between the North Sea and the Mediterranean is not whether we can induce the Allies to spare small craft for the [305]
Grand Fleet, but how cheaply we can stave off the constant stream of new appeals which Russia, France, and Italy pour iu upon us without cessation.There remains the question of the proper distribution of the small craft that we are able to keep in our own waters. And here, speaking for myself, I should be very glad if the War Council would take some of the burden of responsibility for this distribution off the &quot;shoulders of the Admiralty. If the Grand Fleet is to have more destroyers, more mine-sweepers, and more light cruisers, it must be at the expense of our defences along the East coast, of the ships guarding the trade routes in the southern portion of the. North Sea and in the Channel,, and of the flotilla under the command of the Admiral at Queenstown which protects the great converging trade routes between Ireland and the Scillies. Not one of the commanding officers engaged on these tasks thinks he has enough small craft to carry out his own duties. Their complaints are unceasing, and on the Admiralty is thrown the task of deciding how resources which (at present) are not enough to go round, had best be distributed among the various claimants. If the War Council desire to discuss this problem with the Admiralty, I. for one, should raise no objection.&quot; 5. Construction should be accelerated by the immediate recall from the front of fitters and other classes of skilled labour.&quot;I understand that for some considerable time every effort has been made to carry out this policy.A. J. B.February, 25, 1916.PRIHTBO AT THE JORBIGX OJTICB BY C. R   HARRISOW-26/2/1916.
