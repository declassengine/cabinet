19SECRET.G.-52.THE CONTROL OF THE OPERATIONS IN MESOPOTAMIA.Note Prepared by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff by directionof the War Committee.1. IT has been a long-established custom for the Government of India to control and direct military operations which have been based upon that country. In the&apos;-conduct of such operations it has, with rare exceptions, acted independently of the War Office, and His Majesty&apos;s Government has exercised such general control and supervision as have been required through the medium of the India Office. In effect, then, India has, from a military point of view, been treated as a country under British suzerainty.2. This arrangement has had undoubted advantages in the past, when an intimate-knowledge of local politics and local conditions has been of paramount importance ; when India has herself been able to meet the requirements of the situation, and when there has been no question of the employment of the resources of the Empire as a whole in the attainment of a common end. In the present war, however, established custom and local conditions must, to some extent, give way to the general aim. India can no longer meet the requirements of the campaign in Mesopotamia without assistance from Home, and the co-ordination of military operations in every theatre of war in which we are concerned has become a matter of urgency.3. The system by which the campaign in Mesopotamia is controlled at the present time is undoubtedly cumbersome. - The decisions of the  War Committee are: communicated through the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy, who passes; them on to the Commander-in-Chief in India, who in his turn issues his instructions to the General Officer Commanding in Mesopotamia.   The War Office is not in as close a touch with the operations as is desirable, and has not at any given moment exact&apos; information as to the strength and distribution of the troops employed, yet it is called&quot; upon to provide reinforcements of men and munitions whenever the resources of India prove insufficient.   These reinforcements can only come either from the reserves at Home or from other theatres of war, and events in Mesopotamia, over which the War Office has, up to the present time, had no control, thus react upon operations elsewhere which are under its direct supervision.4. As  an  alternative to the existing system I recommend the following procedure : (1.) The Cbmmander-in-Chief in India to receive instructions with regard to military operations in Mesopotamia and Persia from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, under the authority of the Secretary of State for War, in exactly the same manner as the Commanders-in-Chief in other theatres. These instructions will, of course, be based on the decisions of the War Committee.(2.) India will remain, as at present, the main base of the force in Mesopotamia, which will continue to be administered by the Commander-in-Chief in India, such requirements of the force as India cannot meet being supplied from other parts of the Empire, subject to the general policy, at the time being, decided upon by the War Committee.(3.) The General Officer Commanding in Mesopotamia will send all reports of operations, states, returns, recommendations as to the higher appoint -ments, and requests for additional units to the Commander-in-Chief - [228-2]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.

in India, and will repeat these to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. -(4.) Demands for drafts to maintain Indian units now in Mesopotamia and for such war material as is being provided from India will, as at present, be made on the Command er-in-Chief, India.(5.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Commander-in-Chief, India, will, as required, correspond direct in regard to the requirements of the force in Mesopotamia, but all questions of principle likely to affect the security of India will continue to be referred by the Commander-in-Chief in India to the Viceroy and, if necessary, will be communicated by him to the Secretary of State for India.(6.) Arrangements in regard to prisoners of war, our sick and wounded, and as to the finance of the campaign will remain as at present.(7.) All press communiques will be issued through the War Office and telegraphed to the Commander-in-Chief, India.(8.) Intelligence obtained in India which might affect the operations will be communicated by wire to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and repeated to the General Officer Commanding in Mesopotamia.5. The above arrangement will,.in my opinion, enable the War Committee to adjust more effectively the respective requirements of the campaign in Mesopotamia and of the campaigns in other theatres. We have already reached a stage in the war when our forces in Egypt have become a general strategic reserve for the Empire, and it is almost certain that any considerable reinforcements either for India or for Mesopotamia must come from Egypt. It is in accordance with sound military principles that the authority which controls the reserves should also control the operations which those reserves may be required to support. It is also in accordance with these principles that the base of operations should be under the same general control :as the forces in the field. It does not, therefore, seem advisable that the War Office should attempt to conduct directly the operations in Mesopotamia so long as India remains the main base for the campaign in that country, and consequently I have recommended that these operations should be controlled by the War Office, through the Commander-in-Chief in India.6. The system proposed can only work effectively if it is accepted whole-heartedly by the Government of India, and if precedent and established custom are, for the nonce, set aside in the general interest. No compromise or half measure will lead to any improvement on the existing arrangement; while, given good-will on both sides, central control over all the forces of the Empire in the field will lead both to greater efficiency and economy of force. As to this we may well learn from our chief enemy, who now directs with great advantage to himself not only the military forces of the various principalities which compose his Empire, but even the armies of his allies. The cause of the Entente has suffered ;greatly from the want of co-ordinated action, and this lack of co-ordination is increased by the existing system under which India is outside the control of the Imperial General Staff.W.
