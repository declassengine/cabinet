[This Document is the Property,of His Britannic- Majestys Government.]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   October 1916.SECRET. -      9G.-83.SUPPLY OE AEROPLANES. (Previous Paper G-77.)Mr. MONTAGUS memorandum [G.-77] of September 1916, which he has recently circulated to the War Committee, is a renewal, with certain modifications, of a proposal put forward by him in August for the consideration of the War Office and the Air Board. This earlier proposal received careful consideration from the Air Hoard, and a memorandum pointing out the objections to which it gave rise was prepared and communicated to the Army Council, where it was understood that Mr. Montagu&apos;s proposal was to be discussed. I was informed in due course that the Army Council, having before them Mr. Montagu&apos;s proposal and the objections of the Air Btiard, had refrained from giving the former their approval.As Mr. Montagu has now submitted his scheme afresh to the War Committee, I propose to deal briefly with it; but as I am about shortly to lay before the Committee a report on the whole question of the development of the air services of this country, in the course of which 1 shall endeavour to deal with the problem of aircraft supply, I think that the Committee would be well advised to postpone a discussion. of Mr. Montagu&apos;s proposal until they have the larger scheme before them.In the memorandum in which Mr. Montagu&apos;s proposal was, at an earlier stage, contested by the Air Board, it was pointed out that the great achievement of the Ministry of Munitions consisted in the production of a vast output of standard equipment in a comparatively short space of time. Such an output is not required for &quot;the Plying Corps. The keynote of all the demands which reach us from General Trenchard and General Haig is not quantity but performance. The struggle for aerial supremacy is not so much a conflict of numbers as a race to attain a constantly improved standard of climbing, fighting, and carrying efficiency. At this moment a source of urgent anxiety to General Trenchard lies in the appearance on the German front of two new machines better in certain respects than any which we now possess there. It is not the number of these available that concerns him, but the fact of their superiority. We are developing fresh engines and fresh aeroplanes which we believe will surpass the recent German productions. But the question at issue is, Will our machines in fact be superior, and will they be developed in time ? A similar phase in the struggle occurred a year ago, when the German Eokker,. a machine of superior performance in certain respects, temporarily put our airmen at a disadvantage. This kind of struggle will no doubt constantly reproduce itself so long as the war lasts.If we are to emerge successfully from it, the point of capital importance is that the designer and the manufacturer should work in the closest possible touch with the Plying Corps, which uses the machine and has direct experience of the developments of aerial warfare. The next most important requirement is that the air services should have at their command the best designing and inventive ability in respect of aeronautics which the country possesses. The third requirement is the greatest possible flexibility in the arrangements for the manufacture of aircraft to permit of constant variation and modification of pattern following upon the heels of experience.It was pointed out in the memorandum of the Air Board that the transfer of supply to the Ministry of Munitions must inevitably destroy the close and intimate connection which exists at present between the General Staff side of the Military Aeronautics Department and the branches responsible for production. The requirements of the Expeditionary Eorce vary so frequently and aerial conditions change so rapidly that counter-orders, cancellations, and modifications of every scheme [1152] &apos;
or project put forward are inevitable. These difficulties have been met so far by-constant oral communication between, the General Staff and the production brandies, often occurring many times in the course of the same day. During the period in which the production branch was quartered in Albemarle Street this communication became impossible, and loss of touch to some extent ensued ; and this was one of the most important factors which led to the removal of the Department of Military Aeronautics to its present quarters at Adastral House.It was further pointed out that the scheme as then put forward by the Ministry of Munitions did not appear to be satisfactorily worked out in its details. Although it was suggested that the &quot;War Office should retain the control of design and experiment, the Royal Aircraft Factory, which is the chief instrument for these purposes, was to be handed over to the Ministry of Munitions. The provision for repairs, a matter ,of very great importance in aerial supply, was open to criticism. The arrangements for communication between the Air Service and the Design Departments of the Royal Aircraft Factory and of private firms also appeared to be defective.Finally, it was pointed out that this proposal, if not wholly inconsistent with the terms of reference to the Air Board contained in the resolution of the War Committee, dated the 11th May, 1916, under which the Board was specifically and directly &quot; charged with the task of organising and co-ordinating the supply of material, and of preventing competition between the two Departments,&quot; could have no other result than fatally to circumscribe its aims and scope just at the moment wdien it is about to submit proposals for improving its own organisation and carrying out the larger objects for which it was created.Mr. Montagu&apos;s memorandum to the War Committee reproduces his earlier proposal with this principal modification: that, whereas in its earlier form it dealt only with the supply of aircraft for the Royal Flying Corps, it is now proposed to transfer to the Ministry of Munitions the supply services both of the Royal Flying Corps and of the Royal Naval Air Service.I concur in the view expressed by Mr. Montagu that it is inexpedient to leave the supply of aeroplanes to the Admiralty and the War Office acting in independence of each other ; but when he goes on to claim that it will be better to avail ourselves of the experience and staff of the Ministry of Munitions for the purpose of unification than to endeavour to create a new machinery for the purpose, I differ. If there is to be no new machinery, if the Director of Aircraft Equipment is to continue, as at present, to make demands on the Departments of the Ministry of Munitions which deal with labour and machine-tools, merely substituting Whitehall Gardens for Adastral House as his address, in what way will the Ministry of Munitions be able to help aircraft supply more effectively than it can at present ? It will, no doubt, be able to exercise a more uncontrolled discretion as to the degree of precedence which it shall give to one arm of the Service as compared with another; but is it desirable that this uncontrolled discretion should rest with the Ministry of Munitions ?The only new arguments which Mr. Montagu adduces for the application of the methods of the Ministry of Munitions to the production of aeroplanes are contained in the 11th and 12th paragraphs of his memorandum. In the former paragraph he argues that the &quot; changes of design which affect the component parts of an article can be put into operation more easily when the particular part affected is being made by a small number of firms who specialise in its production than when it has to be carried out by a larger number of firms concerned with the production of a complete article.&quot; This paragraph shows, I venture to think, a complete misconception of the present situation. It is not the case that at present a large number of firms is concerned with the production of any one engine. The Rolls-R/oyce engine is made - only by Messrs. Rolls-Royce and Messrs. Brazil Straker; the 110-h.p. Le Rhone only by Messrs. Allen and Messrs. Peter Hooker; the 110-h.p. Clerget only by Messrs. Gwynne and Messsrs. Ruston and Proctor; the R. A.F. 3 a. only by Messrs. Armstrong and Messrs. Napier; the R.A.F. 4a. only by Messrs. Siddeley Deasy and xVEessrs. Daimler ; only three firms are engaged on the manufacture of the R.A.F. 1a.A somewhat similar misconception appears to underlie the arguments in the 12th paragraph. It is not the case to any considerable extent that a firm making aero-engines also takes orders from other Government Departments. Firms producing aero-engines are, in nearly all cases, devoted entirely to that kind of Avork, for instance, Messrs. Siddeley Deasy, Peter Hooker, Gwynne, Rolls-Royce, Allen, Lanchester, and Wolseley. The policy of the Air Department is to extend this specialisation and so to attain by other and more satisfactory methods the object aimed at by Mr. Montagu.
I am far from suggesting that output is a matter of sm ill importance, hut I desire to make it clear that the increase of output which is required is not such as to render necessary the particular kind of revolution which is advocated by the Minister of Munitions. On Sir Bousrlas Haig&apos;s representations, an increase of establishment from 70 to 78 squadrons of the lloyal Flying Corps has been authorised, each squadron being of 18 machines instead of 12, as in the past, with a proportional increase of reserve squadrons or depots. The total number of additional workmen required by the manufacturers to carry out the full naval and military programme is only 7,000. The total requirements of the Royal Flying Corps do not exceed, I believe, 2,000 tons of steel per month, the amount which a single firm could turn out in a week. The demands for machine-tools were at one moment considerable, but they will now diminish. - They are not comparable with the requirements for gun and shell production.If the Air Board have pressed with some urgency on the Ministry of Munitions their recommendations on the subject of labour, materials, and machine-tools for the aircraft industry, it is not because those requirements are in themselves considerable, hut because of the vital importance of this small service to the efficiency of our Army. The assistance of the Ministry of Munitions will, T. feel convinced, enable the relatively small demands to be met without a change of system calculated to reduce the flexibility of present arrangements and the existing close co-operation between the Flying Corps, the designer, and the manufacturer.&apos;        . &quot; C. of K.&apos;   October 12, 1916. .
