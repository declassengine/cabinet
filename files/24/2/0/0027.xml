Printed fof the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1916.SECRET. G.-73.THE ARAB REVOLT.Peecis op Evidence of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Mark Sykes, Bart. M.P., at a Meeting (see Paper W. C.-53) of the War Committee held at 10, Downing Street, on July 6, 1916.I DEAL only with political administration: we require two decisions, (1) on general policy towards the Arabs ; (2) on the means of carrying it out.In dealing with the Asiatic Arabs we have to deal-with people divided by religion, social custom, economic condition, but bound by one common language and an intense sense of race or breed. I dealt in some detail with this aspect of the problem in December. If we are to work the Arabs for what they are worth, I am strongly of opinion that we should adopt a definite policy towards them which should permeate all our dealings with them.   I should put it in words as follows : &quot; Towards all Arabs, whatever their condition, whether independent allies, as Ibn Saud and the Shereef, inhabitants of protectorates, spheres of influence, vassal States, we should show ourselves as pro-Arabs, and that wherever we are on Arab soil that we are going to back Arab language and Arab race, and that we shall protect or support Arabs against external oppression by force as much as we are able, and from alien exploitation. That where we govern we shaU employ Arabs in the administration where we do not employ Englishmen, and that where we employ Arabs we intend to give them the executive authority of their rank, and that we do not recognise any social distinction between an Enghshman and an Arab of the same rank, and, further, that we do not intend to introduce the idea of a ruling race.&quot;I suggest we should obtain the concurrence of the French to this policy, and an agreement that such policy is to be mutual in our respective spheres. I have discussed this matter with M. Picot, and he not only agrees with it, but tells me he will urge it upon his Government. What I want to make clear is that in my opinion Arabs cannot be run on the lines of &quot; the white man&apos;s burden.&quot; The Arabs have many faults and. failings, but they have physique, fire, and a nimbleness of mind and a sense of breed which makes it impossible to adopt the white versus coloured attitude towards them. I do not recommend that this policy be made public, or that we commit ourselves by pledges or undertakings to the Arabs, but that if His Majesty&apos;s Government sees, fit to adopt this policy, that it be translated into&apos; action by instructions to our officers and reorganisation and co-ordination of the political service in those regions where we are in contact with the Arabs.The second matter in regard to political policy is the revitalisation of the British in the area mentioned. Before going any further I should like to pay tribute both to Sir H. McMahon and Sir Percy Cox. I am not making a compliment when I say that I think that, considering the circumstances, they have both done extraordinarily weU. I say that with the same meaning and purpose that I should say it in private conversa-tion, and not as a formal observation in a report. And what I am going to say has no reflection on either of them in both the spheres for which they are responsible.With regard to Egypt, I am strongly of opinion that Sir H. McMahon requires help in the way of instructions. The civil policy in Egypt since the beginning of the war has been &quot; Business as usual.&quot; There has been a steady effort to cany on the administration as though very little were afoot, with the result that people have gone in for junketing, entertainment, and have drifted into a tendency to let things slide. This has produced a deadening of energy and a defensive or passive atmosphere in the civilian, and reacts on the military and on the natives themselves. Moreover, the death of Lord Kitchener is a great event in Egypt. Native and civil British opinion. .was that Sir H. McMahon was only a temporary holder of the position, and that Lord Kitchener was coming back. Lord Kitchener was a link with Lord Cromer, Gordon, and the early years of energy and vitality, and the&quot; tradition of nails and scorpions for
the idle or incompetent; so long.as he was a potential force we, could drift without danger, now that he has gone we depend entirely on ourselves.If His Majesty&apos;s Government would deal with this situation I think that Sir H. McMahon should be given instructions informing him that His Majesty&apos;s Government had the highest appreciation of the work he has done hitherto, and then proceeding to inform him that they have decided that civilian Egypt must be put on a war footing, that everything in the civil administration must be subordinated to military operations, that the sports, entertainments, and display of any kind is to be discountenanced, and that all resources of energy and material are to be concentrated on the prosecution of the war, and that the High Commissioner is to show himself ruthless in dealing with any officials who show want of energy. If such instructions could be conveyed as part of a potential military action I believe that the Egyptian atmosphere would be changed, and that the actual military value of the troops in Egypt would be materially increased, that we should increase our supplies of labour, food, material, and mechanical resources threefold, and that the natives would begin to respect us.So much for Egypt. I now come to the Gulf and Mesopotamia and the political work of Sir Percy Cox. This is the most difficult thing I have to say ; it is what I have felt for over a year, and the more I have seen and read the more strongly am I convinced of what I am about to say, and that is that the Government of India is , incapable of handling the Arab question. In saying this I make no reflection on the Government of India. Circumstances, atmosphere, and tradition conspire to make the thing as it is. For reasons that need not be recited the Indian Moslems are pro-Turk, and when I say pro-Turk I do not mean sentimentally pro-Turk, in the sense that some English people are pro-Turk, in admiring the sturdy and picturesque qualities of the Anatolian peasant; the Indian Moslems who count in India are pro-Committee, they want to see Turkey a strong military Power counting in the counsels of Europe. Moreover, the British officials in India are themselves influenced by this pro-Turkish atmosphere and unconsciously or subconsciously sympathise with it. Consequently, anything which is fundamentally anti-Turkish that is, anti-Committee is anti-pathetic to the Indian Government. The Arab movement, as such, is disliked in India just as Kaimil Pasha was disliked and Enver is admired. This fundamental influence is supplemented by another. The Indian Government is accustomed to treat affairs relating to natives and native governments from a social and political standpoint as regards Englishmen and natives, based on a colour line and on dominion, in a way which is utterly alien to Arabs and Arabian questions. Moreover, there is an absolute antipathy between the Indian and the Arab, and anyone who tries to deal with Arabs on Anglo-Indian lines will jar on the Arab at every turn.Now all these things influence the political staff in Mesopotamia. They temper the wind as best they can, but so long as they depend upon India for control, promo-tion, and approval, so long will our whole Arabian policy be discordant or unreal.The combined effect of these influences is subtle but powerful. It is working on three lines Moslem India is openly anti-Arab and pro-Committee of Union and Progress ; Indian policy is deferential to Moslem views Indian administration is based on Indian methods and traditions., which means the importation of Indian law, Indian lawyers, and Indian personnel, and the training and payment of such native personnel as exists on Indian traditions which must end in discontent and restlessness among the Arabs. This will be aggravated by the introduction of Indian domestic and social habits, and the colour line.Lastly, it is useless to ignore the jealousy which subsists between Simla and Cairo. This is an old long-standing feud, but real nevertheless ; a cause of constant irritation, aggravated by climatic conditions which leads to want of co-operation and enthusiasm. The Mesopotamian political staff is excellent. I cannot speak too highly of Sir Percy Cox&apos;s work. He has studied the country and learnt much ; but it will never be free so long as it depends upon Simla. The only way to unity aud co-ordination that is discernible is to place the political affairs of Mesopotamia, Aden, and Muscat directly under the Foreign Office, London, and appoint Sir Percy Cox as High Commissioner to Mesopotamia with equal rank to Sir H. McMahon, so that the policy is the policy &quot;of London direct, and not -filtered through a remote and somewhat unsatisfactory channel. The Foreign Office and India Office are in close touch, and if the control comes from under one roof then it will be possible to prosecute a simultaneous and ^equal policy.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., My .6, 1916.PRINTED AT THE JFOBEIGtf OFFICE BY C.
