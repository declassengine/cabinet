THE present organisation, under which the supply of. aircraft materiel is the concern of two bodies-the War Office and the Admiralty-acting under the general supervision of a. third the AirBoard- and in constant and inevitable competition with a fourth-the Ministry of Munitions-appears, to., me- to -be- one for. which no arguments can be adduced, and which cannot be expected to obtain satisfactory results. -In - my opinion it is- necessary&apos;at once to iadopt one of two plans either to set up a new Supply Department responsible for&apos;the entire supply erf&apos; both -Air Services, or to entrust the task of obtaining that supply to the Ministry of Munitions, which was created to meet a situation in regard to munitions similar to that which now appears to exist in regard&apos;to: aircraft.&apos;-.: &apos;, ...     ...... .. &quot;- . ; .--. 1 am sure that my colleagues will-not suspect me of wishing without good-reason to add to the heavy burden of work and responsibility which already rests on the Ministry of Munitions. But L feel that I Cannot..allow the possibility of any such misunder-standihg to stand in the way of my laying- before the-&apos;War Committee for consideration the following proposals in regard to the supply of aircraft materiel. I believe these proposals to be sound in themselves, and. morebver they embody the views which have gradually gained in strength.and crystallised (themselves in the. minds of members of the-staff of the-Ministry who have, been watching problems of this character through an anxious period of many months.     - -        &apos; -.-        .-&apos; . .2. The main reason for-any extension of the sphere of the Ministry of Munitions must be&apos;a reasonable expectation that. the transfer of one more branch of supply to the Ministry will result in certain things wanted-by ^the-Army or the&apos;Navy, or both, being obtained more quickly and without interference!-with other urgent requirements, and not less economically or by adopting addwer standard;-- ;-     ------ &amp;From the point-!of viewiof-Supply, the essence of the present situation-is that the means and materials of production are now becoming: more and- more limited. Both of labour and of materials there, is now:not enough to satisfy demands. The problem is therefore one of the more complete organisation of the rengineering and allied industries^ in order that the best possible use-may be ma4e of all the materials, labour, machinery, and experience which are available. In particular, H is plain that the demand for an increase in the production of aeroplanes, coinciding as it does with an increased demand for&apos;motor mechanical.transport, for the supply of which the Ministry of Munitions have now become completely responsible, must mean &amp; certain readjust-ment-of-the war-work which is mow i being-.carried on by the makers of motor engines.The problem of obtaining surplus)production in a market in which supplies falls continually short of demand is the profel^-tbiD^tv^hiohrthe ^nistry ^ -IJunitions was created. In the course of his efforts to find a&apos; solution, the Minister has taken certain powers by which he controls ^ne^fsiippiyfH^rlb^iBh^anlS priceirof materials and machine tools&apos; and, to a certain extent, the movement of labour, arid the conditions under which labour works.&quot; :&apos; J      &quot;r &quot; &apos;:- s ----A&apos;v .jf...**v.   -&quot;5. The tremendous increase in production of munitions of war which1 has taken place since the formation of the Ministry must be attributed primarily to the control of industry which: the Ministers powers have enabled&apos; hiin; to:establish; The factors making for increaserl outnirfc&apos;may- be roughly classifier! ap follows      ;  &apos;    &apos;-:; &apos;Ti &apos;&quot;a(a.) Increase of manufacturing capacity has been encouraged through the-protection afforded to;the  a^uConc^ed^rroDa^anciali&apos;risfe&apos;fo^-the.plackigo extended orders^ while.&apos;the concentration id-one I)ep;artment of all financial negotia-- Uhtions with each firm has promoted economy. [1068] -   &quot; /-92
(6.) Competition between contractors for machine tools, labour, and materials has been stopped. A shortage in all these manufacturing resources has been^ and is, a ruling factor in the situation. But the hoarding of such resources in some quarters at the expense of a disastrous shortage elsewhere has been reduced to a minimum, and with it the attendant wastage, overlapping, and friction.(c.) The priority given by contractors to particular orders has, in consequence of the control exercised by the Ministry, been governed by urgency and not by consideration of profit. It has therefore been possible from time to time to concentrate on the particular munitions which were in most urgent demand.(d.) Improvements in methods of manufacture leading to increased output have not been confined to the individual manufacturers who discovered them, but through the medium of the large out-door staff of engineers and inspectors, and of bulletins published by the groups of manufacturers forming the Boards of Management, have been widely advertised.6. The main work of the Ministry, however, has been (1.) To create new sources of supply by the establishment of National Factories, and(2.) To utilise in the production of munitions firms who had no previous experience of this work and were not laid out to do it.Of these two methods, the second was the more productive of immediate results. The method adopted has throughout been that of specialising particular firms on those operations or series of operations which lay within their power, and afterwards assembling the results to form completed articles. For example,, few firms have attempted to produce complete rounds ; on the contrary, some produce shell bodies ; some, fuse parts ; some, parts of primers ; some, parts of gaines ; some, cartridge cases, and so on. Again, groups of manufacturers have co-operated to produce shell bodies, and in this way have made use even of small workshops of one-lathe capacity. Similar examples are thepro-duction of gun carriages by co-operation between a group of manufacturers, none of whom had the capacity to produce a whole gun carriage, and all of whom were already deeply engaged in war work before undertaking this particular contract, and the production of rifles by the &quot; peddling &quot; method, which is just beginning to bear full fruit.7. It might be argued that all the organisation which has been mentioned above, and the powers which have been invested in the Minister, might be used to assist an outside body in obtaining the supply of any fresh article. This is only theoretically correct. In practice, the actual working of all the regulations which have been made  decisions on cases of priority, demands for material or tools of labour, the speeding up of the output of one firm in order that it may keep pace with that of another, the passing on of ideas from one firm to another at the proper time, and so on-depends intimately on the inside knowledge of the capacities and characteristics of individual works and individual works&apos; managers, which has been acquired during the past twelve months by engineers and other officers of the Ministry who have been in and out of the works day by day.8. Moreover, the situation, now that practically every firm which can be utilised at all is engaged on the production of munitions of war, is much more complicated than it was when the Ministiy first commenced its activities and had a certain clear field on which to begin operations. The difficulty of obtaining extra supply is therefore correspondingly greater.   The only ways of doing so are : (a.) To take firms off munition work in favour of work for aeroplanes. (b.) To utilise plant unsuitable for munition manufacture which is now lying idle, (c.) To dovetail contracts for aeroplane parts or operations on aeroplane parts into running contracts for munitions of war.9. It is plain that the demands both for aeroplane engines and for motor transport engines must in the main fall upon the old motor firms who alone have the skilled management essential to successful manufacture, or to the control of peddled schemes for the production of such highly specialised articles as motor engines. Enquiry has shown that while at present this industry is not capable of undertaking with any prospect of success the orders which would under present arrangements be given to various firms by officers of three separate Departments, it could, if organised as a whole for the purpose, undertake the greater part of them.
THUNTED AT TUK COIiEIGX OFFICE BY C. II. UAUKUOK. -20/9,1916.10. The Ministry has already an organisation which knows the capacity of every firm and workshop in the country, how far that capacity is at present employed on war work and which firms could most easily be turned on to work other than that for which they are specifically laid out.It is almost impossible that the information in the possession of these engineers and inspectors should be made available for any outside body. The only people who can use it to the full are the people who have it. Even if it could all be tabulated, the results would be of small value to anyone without the personal experience which is possessed by the outside staff of the Ministry as the result of their twelve months&apos; work in the country.To obtain from motor firms and others who could make motors or parts of motors the maximum supply of a new article, while retaining the maximum production on existing contracts, involves an adjustment of demands, not merely firm by firm, but operation by operation, of a kind which is only possible under the immediate supervision of those who know intimately all that the firms are doing and all that they can do.11. The main reason adduced for making the supply of aeroplanes the concern of a separate body in intimate touch with the Air Services is that design is still in the experimental stage. While it is a misconception to imagine that the design of munitions stores is in any way standardised, it may be admitted that changes in areo-engine design are likely to be even more frequent than they are in the case of shells or fuzes. But this very circumstance makes it the more essential that the supply should be in the hands of that body which has control of the greatest number of firms and which can, therefore, carry the specialisation of operations to the furthest point. Changes of design which result from experience in use affect the component parts of an article, and can be put into operation much more easily when the particular part affected is being made by a small number of firms who specialise in its production than when it has to be carried out by a larger number of firms each of whom is concerned with the production of a complete article.12. For these reasons I cannot help feeling that such an organisation would have many advantages. It would prevent the loss of time which at present results when a firm takes orders from two Government Departments, and, being unable to deal properly with both together, devotes itself mainly to the one which will pay it best. It would make for the saving of money which results when all the arrangements with a firm are in the hands of one negotiator. It would prevent the waste of labour which results when a firm can play off the needs of separate Departments against the Labour Officers of the Ministry. It would make for economy in the supply of materials and machinery from our limited stocks. It would increase output, lessen cost, and obviate the over-lapping and friction which must occur more and more frequently if the present system is allowed to continue.13. In a word, I do not think it expedient to leave the supply of aeroplanes to the Admiralty and the War Office acting separately, and I feel it to be much better to avail ourselves of the experience and staff of the Ministry of Munitions than to endeavour to create a new machinery.I have put these proposals to the War Office and the Air Board. So far as the negotiations went I understand that the War Office is not unfavourable to them. The Air Board, to whom I only submitted the proposals in so far as they related to the Army, are opposed. With Lord Curzon&apos;s permission I should be willing to circulate to my colleagues the documents which have passed between the two Departments, together with a draft reply to his objections.E. S.
