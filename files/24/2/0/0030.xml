Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   September 1916.THE PROBLEMS OF PEACE.WHEN some months ago I urged upon the Prime Minister and the Government that their attention should be given to problems of peace, I ventured to suggest that there were&apos; three sets of problems for. discussion :--1. The problems of peace.*Z. The problems of transition from wrar to peace.3. The problems of peace policy after peace has been restored.2 and 3 are now being tackled by the Reconstruction Committee. I do not think that they are being tackled with any too much energy. The War Office, in particular, is obviously very busy with war problems, but, if peace were to come suddenly we are so little ready to demobilise the army that I tremble to think of the chaos and dissatisfaction that would occur.But, after the discussion of Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s paper the other day, I want most earnestly to submit to my colleagues that the set of problems concerning peace itself require &quot;immediate attention. It is horrible to allow oneself to think even for a moment that the fruits of victory may be spoiled for us by unsatisfactory terms of peace.It is not, I claim, safe to leave out of account altogether the possibility of sudden peace. The commonplace admission that Germany is a scientifically Organised country, and pursues all its activities methodically and scientifically with a view to efficiency and wasteless working makes a sudden peace all the more likely, for although it. is British and magnificent to fight when you know that you have lost, it is certainly not efficient, nor scientific nor unwasteful. I have been told that people who have commercial relations with individual Germans have found from experience that nobody is more likly to run away, or at least try to &quot;get out&quot; when the fight is up than the Germans. Even if the time has not yet come when we are undoubtedly winning, on the assumption which I imagine everybody makes that we are going to win, the time must come when the intelligent, calculating, scientific people of Germany will realise that we are winning, and that nothing can prevent us. The fight will be up. Can we dismiss from our minds the possibility of their trying suddenly to make peace ? Are we not certain that they have prepared what they will claim on various hypotheses as totheir degree of victory or defeat ? Is is not likely that our principal Allies have already decided what they want ? Is it not human to fear that they, exhausted as they must be to a greater or less degree, will be tempted to get as much of what they want as they can at the expense of one another ? Is it not certain that it will most likely be at our expense if we have not got our plans as cut and dried as they are likely to have theirs ?/-The solidarity of the Allies in this war is marvellous and to some extent confutes the experience of history, but it must be remembered that there is no community of aim except detestation of Germany and a determination to avoid a repetition of her menace. We have no material objects, unless the circumstances of the war itself have made it imperative, as I think they have, that we should keep the German colonies, but our interests, I presume, are the maintenance of our, sea-power, the security of peace and the restoration of Belgium. What does France really care about Belgium, or what do we care about Alsace Lorraine ? What does Russia care about either Belgium or Alsace Lorraine ? What do we really care about Constantinople or Poland ? What does anybody except Italy care about the Irredenta ? I do not mean by this that we are not sympathetic with one another&apos;s claims ; all I mean is that they are different and unconnected claims. [1018]SECRET. G.-76.
All the more then, ought we not to proceed to the consideration of certain matters ? First, ought, we not to consider the conditions and terms on which we should consider an armistice-such conditions as the maintenance of blockade, the withdrawal from occupied territories, the occupation of German territory, &amp;c.; or, indeed, whether we shall agree to an armistice at all. Ought we not also to consider whether we are or are not prepared to accept mediation by any neutral ? The only neutral, I presume, which would be considered iss the United States of America, and so contemptible and untrustworthy does the American politician of all parties in recent international politics seem to me that I hope this question will be answered in the negative for we can rely on no solution from America which considers civilisation, merits, or the future security of peace, but only the immediate political interests of either party.But then ought we not to consider, if we determine to refuse an armistice or mediation, what reasons we can and will adduce for the refusal of one or the other ?Next, ought we not to consider what are the broad principles of the peace which we require ? For instance, I have heard it said that, taking a long view, it would not be statesmanlike so to crush Germany as to leave no satisfactory balance in Europe. This may be so, but I fear that politically it is impossible to imagine that any long-sighted view of this kind can be acceptable or possible to the people of this country, mainly as the result of Germany&apos;s own methods of conducting the war. -Speaking for myself without arguing what is right or what is wrong, I feel it is too late to consider this. Germany has produced in me feelings which make me determined, whatever may come afterwards, to exact from her everything that can be exacted, and I am certain that this is the view of ninety-nine out of every hundred people in this country.But what (does unqualified victory pushed to its final length mean ? Would it not be true to say that we must at least be assured that Germany will pay our price without being able to set against it any compensating advantage anywhere ? If this is to he the general principle, it ought to be laid down before the Foreign Office gets to work, so that if no juggling with the map is contemplated no ingenuity will be expended on devising schemes. I am certain it will be disastrous to let anybody in Germany claim that Anatolia, for instance, is more valuable than Alsace-Lorraine, and so forth.Next, and I speak very tentatively here, can we be sure that we shall go on a solid party of Allies until we have got everything we want ? There may come a time when the Allies are exhausted and when we have given them reason to suppose that we cannot help them as much as they require financially/ Ought we not then to explore the ground and see how far we ican continue to fight without each of our Allies individually?E. S. M.August 29,1916.Postscript.-This was written before the meeting of the War Committee on the 30th August and the Prime Ministers suggestion on the subject, which I need not say I heartily welcome.pkinted at the foeeign office bt c. e. habbisox. 4/9/1916.
