Printed for the Committee of Imperial.Defence.   April 1916.      .   1SECRET, G.-69.GROWTH OF OUR FLEETS IN HOME WATERS, AUGUST 4, 1914, TO MARCH 31, 1916.IN the last few weeks there have been symptoms of a certain uneasiness with regard to our naval position and strength in home waters, particularly in connection with the Grand Fleet. To this feeling no doubt Lord Fisher has largely contributed; and in the letter recently addressed to the Prime Minister, and now circulated to the Cabinet, this feeling of uneasiness is loudly expressed. It may therefore be convenient for the Cabinet to have placed before them in a clear and concise form the comparative strength of our fleet in home waters on the 4th August, 1914, on the 30th May, 1915 (being the date on which Mr. Churchill circulated a survey of the naval position at the moment of his leaving office), and on the 31 st March, 1916.From this survey I have excluded (1) our ships of war in the Mediterranean and elsewhere; (2) the 10th Cruiser Squadron, whose duties are solely connected with the work of blockade. If the Cabinet desire it, n figures on these subjects can easily be added ; but, rmless I am mistaken, it is only the situation in home waters over which any anxiety has been aroused.SuMMAEY of Certain Naval Units in Home Waters on August 4, .1914, May 30, 1915, and March 31, 1916.

Ships paid off are not included.Only light cruisers completed during or later than 1909 are included.Destroyers are called &quot;new &quot; if later than River class, i.e., turbine engined.The Harwich destroyer forces are included as Grand Fleet.It may be observed, with regard to the preceding tables, that the only classes. of ships in which any diminution is observable are pre-Dreadnought battle-ships, armoured cruisers, trawlers and drifters. The diminution in the first two classes is due to the wastage of war. The diminution in the trawlers and drifters is in the main due to no less than 304 having been sent to the Mediterranean to guard our lines of communication. No doubt we should like very much to have some of the latter back in home waters ; but as regards the pre-Dreadnought battleships, the loss of the &quot;King Edward VII&quot; is many times made up for by the additions to the Dreadnought fleet; and our losses in armoured cruisers leaves us still an immense superiority over our enemies in this particular type of vessel.After all deductions are made, it is plain on the face of these tables that the forces with which.we have to meet the German High Sea Fleet were much greater on the 30th May, 1915, than they were at the outbreak of war ; and are much greater now on the 31st March, 1916, than they were ten months ago and this not in one class of ship only, but in all the main classes. We are much stronger in battleships ; we are much stronger in battle cruisers; in light cruisers ; in flotilla leaders ; and the newer type of torpedo-boat destroyers ; and our strength is still growing. Not less marked is the augmentation which has taken place in ships specially designed to deal with submarines and mines. When the war broke out we had no sloops, no patrol boats, no armed motor-boats ; we were very poor in mine-sweepers; and I may add very poor in mines. We had no pro-tected harbours, and no anti-submarine nets. Now all our naval bases are adequately guarded against sub-
marine attack ;* and more than 2,000 miles of nets of various types have been constructed. There has been an enormous output of guns of. small calibre to arm the smaller type of vessel; and the ammunition for every type of gun, big and small, is on a far more satisfactory footing than it has ever been before.Some anxiety has been displayed with regard to our supply of aircraft for patrol purposes and for working with the Grand Fleet; but&apos; here also great progress has been, and is being, made, although I am far from suggesting that our position is satisfactory. Eleven rigids are under order out of a much larger number sanctioned. Thirty-two large non-rigids are under order, though they cannot usefully be completed until sheds are provided for their accommodation a long and costly operation. The improvement both in seaplanes and aeroplanes has been steady and rapid, and we are now in possession of heavier-than-air craft &quot;far more capable of long-distance operations than we were even six months ago.If my colleagues ask me whether I am satisfied that the Fleet has everything that it can desire for fightino-under modern conditions I do not for a moment pretend that it has, but its condition is improving, and will -continue to improve, every month indeed, every week. Whatever dangers may surround us., it seems quite certain that those dangers are more elaborately provided against than they were at the end of last May just as at the end of last May we were batter oil than when war broke put.I should gladly have left the question of our naval strength there if my predecessors in office would have allowed me. But for some reason which I am quite unable to divine, both the late First Lord and the late First Sea Lord are resolved to make the public believe that their successors are not maintaining the high standard which they conceive themselves to have-reached during their period of office. Mr. Churchill contributes to the propaganda by speeches.; Lord Fisher by conversation and correspondence. His letter to the Prime Minister of the 15th March is the last and most, elaborate effort in this direction, and both on account of the eminence of its author and its own intrinsic interest it deserves some reply.This document falls into three parts, or rather deals alternately with three subjects-the good things which Lord Fisher succeeded in accomplishing, the good things which he endeavoured but failed to accomplish through the errors of the late First Lord or the late Cabinet, and the good things which he would have accomplished had he commenced his last term of office earlier, or held it longer.It is clearly only with this last point that I am concerned. Others, if they are so inclined, may deal with Lord Fishers statement that the &quot;Royal Sovereign &quot; class should have been battle cruisers, not battleships. Others must defend the decision of the late Cabinet* The protection of Bosyth, east of the Forth Bridge, is, however, not yet finished, nor the additional defences required in the number.
that no vessels were to he begun in 1914 which could * not be finished by the end of 1915. Personally, I think such discussions very unprofitable. It must always be easy for a man of Lord Fisher&apos;s ability, looking back over a period of rapid naval development, to say: &quot;If my advice had been taken, how much better off we should be ! &quot; Unfortunately the converse process is easier still! Why, during many critical years, did Lord Fisher pay so little attention to the subject of mines? Why did he wait till the outbreak of hostilities to discover the value of Zeppelins for maritime scouting? Why was there not as much energy put into the task of finding a reply to submarine attack as into the task of increasing submarine efficiency? Why were we so deficient in cruisers on the trade routes, and in dockyards for their repair ? Why was.it not realised that defended naval bases on our East Coast were a necessity in case of Avar with Germany that fast destroyers, and many of them, were essential elements in a battle fleet, that minelayers were highly desirable, if we were to hamper the movements of the enemy ; and minesweepers absolutely essential if we were to preserve full freedom for our own ? Nothing has happened in connection with any of these points that might not have been foreseen : wdiy then were they not foreseen? Simply because officials are not omniscient, and prophecy is a difficult art even for men of Lord Fisher&apos;s capacity and experience.These are considerations which might (1 think) have made him more tolerant in criticising other peoples per-formances, and more cautious in -praising his own. It seems, for example, rash to attack the present Board of Admiralty for its defective information about German shipbuilding, for that information is neither better nor worse than that possessed by the Board of which Lord Fisher was the naval head. It seems rash to attack the present Board for permitting army recruiting officers to rob the dockyards of skilled workmen ; for the fatal depletion, from which complete recovery during the present war is hardly to be looked for, occurred before the present Board came into existence. Above all, it seems rash to throw the blame for shortage of destroyers on the present Board, when quite obviously the blame (if there is to be blame) attaches to its predecessors.I am not here referring to anything that happened before the war, but to what happened during the war before the present Board took office. Lord Fisher himsclf observes &quot; that many more destroyers and small craft could have been laid down in the autumn of 1914.&quot; Why, then, were they not laid down ? &quot; Because,&quot; says Lord Fisher, &quot;the Cabinet&quot; (acting, I suppose, on the advice of the late First Lord) &quot; decided that no vessels were to be commenced which could not be completed by the end of 1915.&quot;But this is no reason at all. Lord Fisher tells us that &quot; there should be no difficulty in getting destroyers completed and delivered in twelve months from the date of order.&quot; If, therefore, he did not order destroyers in 1914, it must either have been because lie had not then realised that they were required, or because he did not then believe that they could be finished in twelve months.But while he apparently conceives himself to have
been precluded by the Cabinet decision from laying down destroyers, which certainly were wanted, he thought himself at liberty to lay..down &quot;light battle cruisers,&quot; whose value is much more open to dispute. This seems very extraordinary. A &quot; light battle cruiser &quot; is a ship of some 19,000 tons, armed with 15-inch or 18-inch guns, and requiring elaborate turrets to carry them. A destroyer is a ship of 800 tons, carrying 4-inch guns which do not require turrets at all. Yet the Cabinet order, which prevented the building of destroyers because it would take too long, offered no obstacle to the building of &quot;light battle cruisers,&quot; which must of necessity take much longer !These ill-named vessels are very dear to Lord Fisher&apos;s heart, and much of his present over-critical attitude is seemingly due to the supposed indifference of his successor to their rapid completion. As a matter of fact, they have been pressed on with all practicable speed, though it is at least doubtful whether they are the kind of vessel most required at the present moment. They were built, says Lord Fisher, for a &quot; special strategical purpose,&quot; though I may incidentally observe that, owing to their draught, this &quot;strategical purpose &quot; is one which they will never be able to fulfil. Lord Fisher, however, is doubtless right when he points out that their utility is not therefore destroyed. It would be tragic, indeed, if vessels which cost about 2,000,0001. and require crew of 750 men could fulfil no warlike functiou. But that function is not to take a place in the line of battle. They are not battle cruisers lightor heavy. Theypossess no effective armour. Their merits are of a different kind. The)7 are very fast, and the ^guns they carry, though few in number, are,: of the largest calibre. We may fairly hope, therefore, that although the money they cost and the crews they will require might probably have been better employed on accepted types, they may nevertheless prove themselves of value. But they were not designed for the Grand Fleet, and no one connected with the Grand Fleet has ever approved their construction.Something of the same kind must be said about the heavy monitors, on which so much money and labour were expended during Lord Fisher&apos;s administration. These also were designed for a &quot; special strategical purpose.&quot; These also seem unlikely to be employed in the manner originally intended. This is not, of course,, to deny their value. With all their serious (and quite avoidable] defects-they are very much under-engined, and, especially at first, they steered badly-they are useful additions to the Navy. But even less than the &quot; light battle cruisers &quot; can the)7 be regarded as important additions to the Grand Fleet. They may bombard the shore ; they can do nothing to secure command of the sea.It in no wise follows from.this that they should not have been built. They are naval luxuries, and luxuries may properly be indulged in when necessities have been satisfied. But Lord Fisher&apos;s whole point is that naval necessities, and in particular the necessities of the Grand Fleet, have not been satisfied. The present position of the fleet, he tells us, is &quot;critical.&quot; Critical it may be; but it. is certainly less critical now than it was from November 1914 to May 1915, use&apos;what standards of comparison you please to measure the difference. Yet Lord Fisher, then thought its condition sufficiently [509] .&apos; C
safe to permit him to divert our shipbuilding energies into channels which certainly add nothing to its security. *Lord Fisher seems under the impression that the present Board of Admiralty, whether their building-programme be good or bad, have shown a lamentable-want of energy in pressing it on. I have no reason to think that this is so; and I greatly doubt whether Lord Fisher&apos;s methods are quite as effective as he supposes.In times of peace, when the British Government is only one of the customers catered for by our great ship-building yards, and labour can be got for the asking,, excellent results may be often obtained by &quot; hustling&quot; the contractors; and in the art of hustling, Lord Fisher is without doubt a master. At the present moment, however, conditions are very different. The limit of production is determined not by the size of the yards or the policy of the shipbuilders, but by the supply of appropriate labour. It is therefore useless to bring contractors up to the Admiralty and proceed to threaten or cajole them. Such a procedure does not, as Lord Fisher seems to suppose, make the impossible possible. What it does do is to produce a plentiful crop of broken promises and a certain amount of bad work.Hustling has, indeed, produced other evils and worse. The system of bonuses to workmen, the abuse of overtime, Sunday labour, and so forth, have greatly increased the cost of labour and materially diminished its efficiency. Some of the most embarrassing industrial questions we have had to face are directly due to these causes, and the questions are still unsolved.Those who desire more detailed comment upon Lord Fisher&apos;s letter may read with advantage some notes of the Third Sea Lord, which are available for reference at the Committee of Imperial Defence. But its general purport is clear enough. Stripped of reminiscences,, his main accusation is that the fleet is short of light cruisers and other auxiliary vessels, that its condition is therefore critical, and that for this state of things the present Board of Admiralty is to blame. The reply is simple. If the number of auxiliary vessels is still insufficient, it is because the shipbuilding capacities of the country, great as they are, have not yet been able to meet the requirements of the Navy. This may be nobody&apos;s fault. It certainly is not the fault of the present Board. We have, indeed, gone on with the special vessels designed by our predecessors for strategical (i.e., amphibious) purposes. But with these exceptions, all the available labour in our dockyards, public and private, has been directed to purposes which are purely maritime. The result has been a steady and rapid growth in those classes of - ships which we most urgently require. The growth is still proceeding with undiminished speed. I do not therefore assert that the composition and distribution of the Grand Fleet are perfectly satisfactory; but I do most confidently assert that they are far more satisfactory than they have ever been before; and that among the anxieties which beset those responsible for our naval policy,, anxieties about the Grand Fleet are far from being the most serious.A. J. B.Admiralty, March 31, 1916.* I append&apos; a letter which illustrates the effect of monitor building-upon the organisation of one of our yards..
Palmers&apos; Shipbuilding Company (Limited), gifj Hebburn-on-Tyne, March 17, 1916.H.M.S. &quot;Resolution.&quot;We have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Admiralty letter of the 8th instant, CP. 03146/16/X. 6342, with reference to H.M.S. &quot; Resolution,&quot; which has received our careful consideration.In reply, we beg to state that events which have transpired during the course of this vessel&apos;s construction call for statement and consideration prior to reviewing her present position.The contract date of delivery for.this vessel was the 20th September, 1915.She was launched on the 14th January, 1915, and her delivery by the contract date was arranged for by us and quite assured.In these circumstances, three large monitors were, in December 1914 and January 1915, ordered from us to meet the urgent requirements of the Admiralty. Their construction involved an expenditure of about 574,0001 on our part alone.To carry out this work by day and night shift, all other work in both our shipyards was stripped of men. Both at personal interviews and by letter, the Admiralty pressed&apos;upon us the urgent need for the utmost expedition. Roundly, nine months were occupied in building these monitors.In addition, other urgent work was undertaken and completed by us to meet the needs of the Admiralty.The effect of the foregoing was to delay progress with the &quot; Resolution,&quot; work on which could only be resumed when the monitors were delivered.We would,further observe that on the 11th December, 1914, by Admiralty letter (IP. 71481/14/X. 132135, we were instructed to rearrange the 6-inch gun battery of the &quot; Resolution.&quot; LAlso on the 14th January, 1915, we were directed in person- at the Admiralty to change the &quot; Resolution &quot; from coal to oil burning.Other additional work has from time to time been ordered.As the &quot; Resolution &quot; was the furthest advanced of her class when these changes were made, a large amount of work has had to be undone, involving a great expenditure of time, before the new and additional work could be proceeded wMth.The above-mentioned work has involved on the whole an expenditure of about 120,0001.The expenditure on the monitors and the extra work referred to represent a sum 20 per cent, in excess of the whole of our expenditure in both our shipyards for the year 1914.From the above causes the delivery of the &quot; Resolution &quot; has been much deferred.This postponement has also imposed upon us a financial burden, to which we will refer in a further communication to their Lordships.Meanwhile, recruiting for the Army and Navy was proceeding apace, and to such an extent that the labour market of this district has become seriously depleted.-*The Ministry of Munitions also, with its various Acts and control, came into operation, one of their regulations being to prevent men from moving about from works to works, so that when we came to fit the machinery in the &quot; Resolution&quot; our usual source of supply for the majority of men for this purpose was not available, namely, that of getting the squads who move from place to place on the river to do this work.After prolonged and fruitless endeavours to secure additional labour, men have been obtained recently through dilution of labour and from the Navy in sufficient numbers&apos; to enable us to make reasonable progress with fitting and equipping the &quot;Resolution.&quot;We are pleased to say that circumstances are now so changed as to enable us to undertake to deliver the &quot; Resolution &quot; in August 1916.With regard to paragraph 2 of Admiralty letter under reply, we beg to say that we have delivered one torpedo-boat destroyer ; the second one will be delivered in May, and the remaining six boats will be completed at intervals of six weeks each. This is all the work we have on order from the Admiralty, wnth the. exception of two submarines, which are proceeding at a normal rate, and which will not be disturbed by
