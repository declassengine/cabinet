SECRET. G-72,Part L-Germany.WE have now, after ten meetings of our Committee, reached a stage at which it is possible to record the result of our investigations up to the present time. We have so far confined our enquiry to Germany, by far the most important branch of the subject, and that on which information is somewhat less scanty than in the case of the other enemy countries.In the absence of new sources of information, our main task has been to survey and collate the results of previous investigations by different authorities, to submit the methods and figures to statistical examination, and to arrive at an agreement on the probable conclusions to be drawn from them. The Director of Military Intelligence has furnished us with a great deal of valuable material, including estimates of the numbers of the German forces in the field, on lines of communication, and in depots ; and we have also been supplied by the War Office with detailed information as to British casualties  such as the proportion of wounded to killed, the ratio of permanent loss from wounds and sickness to killed and died of wounds, and the ratio of temporarily unfit to total strength information which was necessary in order to enable us to supplement by estimates the information supplied by the German official casualty lists. The Director of Military Intelligence has further placed at our disposal a secret memorandum by the French War Office, dated the 15th March, 1916, containing the French estimate of German resources based on the analogy of the mobilization of men of military age in France, upon which, after some necessary criticism, we have placed considerable reliance, knowing that in France every man possible had been mobilized for war, and feeling confident that what France had done Germany could do. (The different circumstances of the two countries are noticed later in our report.)For the estimate of the German population at military ages we have relied upon the study of the German census made in the summer of 1915 by Dr. Brownlee and brought up to date by him -for the present purpose ; and as regards the most doubtful portion of our subject, the question of the probable extent to which men of military age, in Germany, must be retained in civil occupations, including those incidental to the war, we have carefully examined the a priori deductions of previous enquirers on this point, the probable requirements of German trade and industry, the employment of prisoners and conquered populations, and the evidence furnished by Mr. A. A. Wotzel from his study of German publications and newspapers on the mobilization of members of trades unions and similar bodies in Germany. The Foreign Office was unable to give us any definite information on this part of the question. These, and many other points arising out of them, have formed the subject of much discussion among members of the Committee, and any conclusions upon them which have been stated without detailed argument or explanation may be taken to be the result of agreement among them after such discussion.Finally, we have consulted Sir Alfred Watson, Actuary of the National Health Insurance Joint Committee, who furnished us with a valuable memorandum, referred to on pp. 6-7, on the question of invalidity in civil life. We have also had the advantage of examining Mr. Burn, of the Prudential Assurance Company, on the German casualty lists which have passed through his hands, and Mr. H. Belloc, who has allowed us to question him on the various estimates he has published at - different periods since the war began in the pages of Land and Water of the number of Germans available for military purposes and of the German casualties. On none of the points on which we consulted Mr. Belloc did he claim any special information; he has constantly modified his statements and opinions as fresh facts became available during the progress of the war, and he readily admitted that his assumptions on matters like the percentage of the total population mobilizable in France and Germany (which he had put at 10 per cent, as a minimum and 13 per cent, as a maximum), the retention of men in industry, the calculation of deduction for unfitness, &amp;c, might be contradicted by facts within the knowledge of the Committee. Nor did he produce [722-1] B
evidence which we could accept as conclusive against the opinions which we have formed as to the value to be attached to the German official casualty lists. One of his principal arguments against the authority of these lists was the existence of private lists to which the French military authorities appear to attach some importance. These were (a) parochial lists, (6) lists of religious and industrial societies (fourteen lists widely spread over the population), (e) rolls of honour (three lists), and (d) big sports clubs (five lists). From these sources it had been inferred that the casualties were some 25 per cent, higher than was revealed by the official lists. While we do not disregard the bearing of such indirect evidence of understatement, we cannot estimate the quantitative effect of any necessary correction on this account; and, as will be seen later, we have not thought it prudent to go beyond the statement that the official casualty lists can only be accepted as a minimum.We have dealt with the subject of our enquiry in the following manner. We have first made an estimate of the maximum number of men which it has been possible for Germany to mobilize. The War Office has furnished a statement of the number of Germans actually under arms, and we have estimated the amount of German losses from all causes. We are thus left with a residue which remains for discussion in connection with the requirements of German industry.   The figures relate to the end of May 1916.Man Powee.In estimating the number of men which Germany might put into the field we have felt that we must rely largely on the experience of France. Notwithstanding the differences of circumstance between the. two countries, their general similarity in regard to the effort to be expected from each is so great, and the difficulties of a priori estimates of deductions from the German fighting numbers on account of physical defects and industrial necessities have proved on investigation to be so formidable, that we have been led to the belief that our estimate for Germany must be largely founded upon the analogy of France. In view of the importance of this estimate it appears desirable to describe in some detail the-method of calculation followed.The total numbers of available Frenchmen and Germans of military age have been calculated, distinguishing their ages, as in December 1915.* The ages taken into account for this purpose were 19-47 (over 19, but under 47), because the memorandum of the French War Office already referred to afforded the information that the men of these ages, corresponding as they do at the date in question to men born in 1869 to 1896 inclusive, or to the &quot;classes&quot; of twenty years later, 1889 to 1916, furnished 6,000,000 troops in France. (We assume that this figure includes men in the navy, though this is not clear from the memorandum.) The estimate of the French General Staff, we understand, makes the number, if anything, slightly higher. Unfortunately, the age distribution of these 6,000,000 men is unknown. This point is of some importance on account of the marked contrast in age distribution between the French and German populations. If, as would appear to be the case,! it is chiefly men physically unfit for military service who have not been mobilized in France, and therefore, on our supposition, who are not mobilizable in Germany also, the older population of France of military age would not be able to yield proportionally so many soldiers as the younger population of Germany.In the absence of information on this point we have assumed military unfitness to increase with age in the same proportion as the death-rate the same assumption as that by which the difficulty is met in the French memorandum. On this assumption the ratios of unfit or otherwise unavailable men at each age necessary to reduce the 7,669,000 Frenchmen, aged 19 to 47, to 6,000,000 have been calculated, and these ratios have then been applied to the numbers of Germans at corresponding* These numbers do not correspond with the actual facts, as they take no account of the wastage of war, but merely furnish as a basis for our calculations an estimate of what the two populations would have amounted to at the date in question under peace conditions. This basis of calculation is open to the objection that in arriving at the result a certain number of men are assumed to have died at the peace-time rates of mortality, whose deaths, whether in battle or from disease, have been a second time deducted in estimating the German casualties.Taking the average total strength of the German army during the first sixteen months of the war at 5.000,000, and the mortality under peace conditions amongst a male population of military age selected for physical fitness at 5 per 1,000, the deaths in question would number about 33,000. Addition of this figure would uot, however, affect the estimate made on p. 6 of the number of Germans available for military service, this number being put down in round numbers to the nearest 100,000.f The French 6,000,000 have been mobilized, as will be seen, out of a total of .7,669,000 Frenchmen at the ages dealt with. The proportion not mobilized is therefore only 22 per cent., a figure for which physical disability may easily account.
ages. The total deductions so arrived at reduce the number of Germans of the classes 1889-1916 to 10,700,000, fit and available, as in December 1915. We are aware that the correctness of the assumption made use of is open to serious question, but the method of its use reduces the risk of serious error to small dimensions. If the question were one of determining directly the number of males in Germany unfit for military service, then the correctness of the ratio to be applied would be a matter of primary importance. By our method, however, these ratios are merely brought in to modify the application of French experience to Germany in view of the greater youthfulness of the German population,. This modification is, in any case, a matter of comparatively minor importance, and, for this reason, even a considerable error in the ratios used would affect the final figures but slightly! When we found, to our regret, that no ratios measuring unfitness for service at various ages were available, we made trial of various substitutes. One of these, the rate of mortality in Germany in 1909-12, is used in the calculation shown. Another, differing materially from it, was tried without affecting the result to any serious degree. This measure consisted of the varying number of days of sickness at different ages in the experience of the Government industrial insurance office at Leipzic. Although the increase with age is considerably less in this case than in that of the mortality ratios, the result of the calculation was found to be affected only to the extent of some 26,000. If no allowance whatever were made for the difference in age distribution between the two populations, the estimate for Germany would be reduced by less than 100,000; and, as shown in the foot-note to p. 6, even the paradoxical use of ratios decreasing instead of&apos; increasing with age, affected the total result in the case dealt with only to the extent of 360,000, or a little over 3 per cent, of the total.The number of men of military age was calculated in the following manner. Taking the actual numbers living at each age, as disclosed by the census of the 1st December, 1910, the deaths occurring year by year have been subtracted, those since .1913 being taken as of average number, giving at each step the number of persons a year older at ,the new period of time. In this way the numbers of men were obtained who, under peace conditions, would have been found in the various age groups at the 1st December, 1915. The figures obtained were checked by those resulting from another process, in which the two latest published German life tables were used to operate on t]ie census figures of the 1st December, 1910, in order to obtain the survivors at various ages at the different dates. The differences between the estimates thus obtained and those adopted are small enough to suggest that the calculation from deaths gives a trustworthy result (see Table I).Table I.Estimates of the Male Population in Germany on December 1, 1915, by(A.)

These were calculated on the basis of the age distribution of foreigners in England and Wales, which is in fair agreement with that returned for Germany also, and by their deduction the numbers of Frenchmen from amongst whom soldiers, might be obtained were found. From these numhers deductions, increasing with age as does the (German) death-rate, were made of such size as to reduce the total to 6,000,000.France, December 1915.Age.	Total Population (Males).

Figures were obtained showing the numbers of male foreigners in Germany in 1910 in certain age-groups on the assumption that the age distribution then was the same as that obtaining in 1900. From these the numbers that would occur in the groups adopted above were estimated, and were then increased in the proportion in which the whole German population at those ages had grown between the 1st December, 1910, and the 31st July, 1914. The number of foreigners of ages 19 to 47 thus found to be included in the figure for the 1st December, 1915, was 484,975.A further deduction had to be made for persons who emigrated after the 1st December, 1910, who were all regarded as unlikely to return to Germany.   The figure
was obtained by adding the emigrants for 1911, 1912, and 1913, and increasing the sum by one-sixth for the first six months of 1914. The result was distributed first for sex, and then in accordance with the male age distribution recorded for the years 1908-10.   The male emigrants of ages 19 to 47 thus estimated totalled 28,819.On the other hand, an addition had to be made for the German males in Austria who would be recalled. The numbers of these in various age-groups in 1910 were available, and it was estimated in a similar manner to that adopted for foreigners that there would be 31,498 between the ages of 19 and 47 on the 31st July, 1914.The net effect of these modifications on the numbers in the various age groups is shown in Table III, from which it appears that the figure of 14,035,836 of male Germans living at these ages on the 1st December, 1915, was thus reduced to 13,553,540.No allowance has been made in our calculations for the return of German subjects resident in foreign countries other than Austria-Hungary.

The total number of about 13,550,000 German males aged 19-47 is thus reduced to about 10,700,000 fit and available had they been exposed merely to the risks of peace in December 1915, or 76&quot;2 per cent, of the total population at these ages. As has already been stated, a similar calculation, based on the relative numbers of days of sickness at each age experienced by the insured population of Leipzic, yielded a nesult but 26-,000 lower, a difference which in the present case must be regarded as negligible. *The classes 1889-1916 (aged 19-47 last December) do not, however, represent the total man power upon which Germany can draw. The class of 1917, assumed to be in training on the 31st May,f consists of about 648,400 lads.. Here it is necessary to assume a higher percentage of unfitness than in the immediately older classes to allow for immaturity, and allowance has also to be made for the extent to which the obligation of military service has been anticipated by voluntary enlistment on the part of these lads. The deduction for unfitness can hardly be less than 25 per cent., which would leave almost 500,000 fit for service, without allowance for volunteers. The French War Office memorandum estimates the number now available from this class at 300,000 to 400,000, and the French General Staff at 420,000, but the British War Office, believing that the number of volunteers accepted from this class has been small, prefers to put the figure as high as 500,000. Addition of this latter number raises the estimate of 10,700,000 for classes 1889-1916 to .11,200,000 for classes 1889-19174 This total compares with the estimate of the Director of Military Intelligence (of the 24th April) of 11,500,000 for classes 1887-1917. The yield of classes 1887 and 1888, which are not included in our total, may be estimated, on the basis of increase of unfitness with age in proportion to mortality (a measure which probably underestimates the extent of increase as the period of total unfitness is approached), at about 370,000, in addition to whom the possible 30,000 returned German emigrants, not included in our total, have to be taken into account. These additions bring our total for the -ages included in the estimate of the Director of Military Intelligence to 11,600,000, or 100,000 in excess of the figure therein arrived at by&apos; a totally different method of calculation.We have obtained confirmation of this estimate also from another source. Sir Alfred Watson, actuary to the National Health Insurance Joint Committee, has kindly prepared for us an estimate of the number of men of military age and fitness in Germany, based on the estimated proportion of men aged 20-25 who were originally6 It might appear at first sight that the figures of mobilized men at different ages quoted on the fourth page of the French War Office memorandum would afford a readier means of applying the French analogy to the German population than that employed above, but investigation has shown that this is not the ease. The memorandum clearly implies that information as to the number of men drafted into each class in France is lacking, and in its absence falls back upon the assumption used by ourselves, viz., that military fitness decreases, with age in the same degree as the proportion of survivors. On this assumption it calculates the proportion of total births in France at different periods represented by mobilized soldiers, and applies these proportions to the German births for the same periods. Not only does this method ignore the fact that the prospects of survivorship from birth to military age have been very much better in France than in Germany, but, as applied in the memorandum, it produces the anomalous result that, in spite of the assumption that fitness for service decreases with age, a smaller proportion of mobilized men is shown for the youngest group than for either of the two older ones.   The figures are as follows: Years of Birth.	Numbers Mobilized.	Proportion to Surviving Males.		Per Cent.&apos;     1890-1896 (age 19-26)	1,500,000	69-61880-1889 (age 26-36)	2,200,000	76-11869-1879 (age 36-47)	2,000,000	74-8If these proportions were founded upon actual experience they might be accepted as showing that, for unexplained reasons, it was easier to call up older men than younger, but, as the age distribution of the 6,000,000 mobilized men was assumed to be influenced only by physical fitness for service, and as this fitness was assumed to decline with age, the only inference to be drawn from the distributed figures quoted is that the application of the assumptions made was faulty.The application to the German population of the proportions serving stated above, as calculated from the French figures for the three age-groups, naturally favours the older population as against the younger, since the smallest proportion is that for the youngest group, which is relatively more numerous in Germany than in France. The figure thus deducible for the German population in December 1915 is 10,340,000 as against what we believe to be the more correct estimate of 10,700,000.t This class began to appear on the front in June.J The additions to be made to this total by the inclusion of younger classes and by the extension of the age limit are considered on p. 15.
passed as fit for service, adjusted, by certain experience of invaliding in trie Britisk postal service. This estimate is considered by Sir Alfred Watson, for reasons stated in his memorandum, to represent a maximum of the number likely to be found fit. It also makes deductions only for physical unfitness, whereas our method of calculating on the basis of the French analogy makes allowance in addition for any fit men who have not been mobilized in France.Notwithstanding these facts tending to make Sir A. Watson&apos;s estimate of fit men higher than our own of fit and available men, it only exceeds the latter by about 250,000. The ages selected differ slightly in the two cases, but the period 20-45 is common ground. For these 25 years of life, Sir A. Watsons estimate is 9,936,000 against our own of 9,705,787. Adding the two years 18-20, Sir A. Watson increases his figure to 11,007,000, which, if further increased by our own estimated figure of 436,000 for ages 45-47 last December (classes 1889 and 1890) is raised to 11,443,000 for the total of ages 18-47 or classes 1889 to 1917 as against our own estimate of 11,200,000. When the causes tending to make the former figure higher than the latter are borne in mind it will be seen that the agreement is very close, and that Sir A. Watsons estimate affords confirmation of our surmise that the French figure of 6,000,000 or more for classes 1889-1916 must represent very nearly, if not quite, all the men in France physically fit for military service at these ages.The number upon which to base our estimate is thus 11,200,000 (from the classes 1889 to 1917 inclusive), in which are comprised: . (1.) Those actually in the armies at the front and on lines of communication. (2.) The navy and naval reserves. (3.) Those in depots. (4.) Permanent loss by casualty.(5.) Temporary absentees owing to wounds and sickness. (6.) Men remaining in industry.Of these items the figures for Nos. (1), (2), and (3) can be stated by the War Office, but some preliminary discussion is necessary to enable us to explain our estimate for Nos. (4) and (5), and thus arrive at the number&apos;of the residue of&apos;the German population fit and of military age which may be presumed to have been retained in industrial occupation in Germany.*Casualties Permanent and Floating.In this connection the first question we shall have to consider is how far the casualty lists issued by the German Government are to be depended upon, a question upon which great difference of opinion has existed.The German official casualty lists have been published in the form of a series of &quot; Ausgaben,&quot; numbered from 1 upwards, since the beginning of the war. Prussian casualties are recorded in a series of Prussian lists, Bavarian casualties in a series of Bavarian lists, Saxon casualties in a series of Saxon lists, and Wiirttemberg casualties in a series of Wurttemberg lists. Each of these series of lists is numbered from 1 upwards. When a list is ready for issue it is combined with any other lists that are ready and published in one or more of the &quot; Ausgaben &quot; mentioned above.At the present time &quot; Ausgaben &quot; are published on every day of the week except Sundays and festivals, and each &apos;daily issue contains one Prussian list, at the end which is added such other, fists (Bavarian, Saxon, or Wurttemberg) as are ready for publication.The lists published during the first months of the war gave the category (i.e., whether of the active army, or a reservist, Landwehrmann, &amp;c.) of each man mentioned, the date of the casualty, and the name of the place where it was incurred, and, in the first month of the war, the location of wounds. The press was allowed to reprint the lists or to publish extracts from them.In February 1915 the press was forbidden to reproduce the lists or to publish extracts from them, and the&apos; names of places where casualties were incurred were omitted towards the end of the month.In June 1915 the dates of casualties were omitted, and from the 1st July, 1915, the category was no longer given. The decrease in the information, though not of an important character in considering the total losses, probably shows that the Germans realised that the lists, in their original form, gave valuable information to the Allies, lhe severe penalties which can now be enforced for reproducing in any form, or even discussing, casualties are a proof that the authorities consider that a free publication of German casualties would have a depressing effect on public opinion.
The lists still give considerable details concerning the. casualty (e.g., killed, died of wounds, died of sickness, fatally injured by accident, drowned while bathing, drowned, severely wounded, wounded, slightly wounded, wounded remaining with unit, injured by accident, missing, prisoner), but they do not record any admissions to hospital for sickness nor any discharges from the army for wounds or sickness. There is also considerable doubt as to whether the deaths from wounds and sickness of such men as die in civil hospitals are recorded, as the entries of deaths in civil hospitals are very rare.The lists give many details of organisation, and no attempt is made to conceal the formation of units, the existence of which might otherwise be unknown to the Allies for a considerable time (e.g., new heavy artillery batteries, sound-ranging sections, carrier-pigeon detachments, &amp;c).In both the British and the neutral press attempts have been made ever since the beginning of the war to ridicule the German casualty lists, and to prove that the totals recorded in them are obviously untrue. Thus it was at one time freely stated that the only figures recorded were those of Prussian losses, and that Saxon, Wurttemberg, and Bavarian losses were ignored. . It will be seen from preceding paragraphs that this statement is and always was untrue. Again, it was represented that the ratio shown of wounded to killed, being out of all proportion to the ratio in former wars, was evidence of deliberate falsification. But the experience of the British and French armies (though their ratio of wounded to killed is higher than that shown in the German lists, namely, 3 to 1 instead of 2T to 1) proves, at all events, that the ratio of 8, 9, and 10 to 1 contended for by such writers as Mr. Belloc at the early stage of the war was altogether but of the question. Again, the fact that the admitted losses in the aggregate were less than those experienced by the French and British was adduced as proof of deliberate suppression. This argument is based on too insecure a foundation to support a serious criticism, without other facts to support it; and the same observation may be made with reference to the arguments from personal impression as when an Allied commander reports in general terms that the enemy&apos;s losses in a particular engagement &quot;largely exceed our own.&quot;&apos; Those who maintain the general accuracy of the German reports admit that doubt is thrown upon it by certain features of the lists.(1.) The casualty lists for the first few months of the war recorded the following totals: 1914.August     , September October November December1915. January February March9,213 125,423 279,753 235,285 201,952163,801 96,241 135,742There is a large and constant decrease in the casualties reported from the 1st November, 1914, up to the end of February 1915, although the lists for these months should have included all the casualties incurred in the fighting on the Yser and at Ypres in October and November 1914, in the fighting at Lodz and Lowicz in November and December 1914, in the winter campaign in the Masurian Lakes, which ended in the failure of the German offensive in the Augustowo area in February 1915, and normally belated casualties from the fighting in August and September 1914.*It is to be noted that this decrease in the number of recorded casualties coincides with the increase of the German army by thirteen new divisions in October 1914 and by nine more new divisions in January 1915, excluding certain Landwehr and Ersatz units that took the field at different times during the winter.If the drop in the recorded casualties is due to the delay in the publication of casualty fists, and if the casualties thus belated had been published since, the lists in which they were published would be abnormally large, and would thus show signs of the publication.   There is no such evidence in any list published since February 1915.* It is sometimes urged that the fighting in the East has been of much less severe a character than the fighting in the West. This does not agree with the recorded casualties, as far as the first eleven months of the war are concerned, as the average of the infantry casualties recorded for units that fought continuously in the Eastern theatre during those mouths was slightly heavier than those recorded for units that fought continuously in the Western theatre.
(2.) The lists contain many definite instances of abnormal delay in publication,, of which the best instances are : (a.) The recent publication of some thousands of casualties dating back to 1914. (6.) The reports of more men, in many units, &quot; no longer missing, but prisoner(wounded, &amp;c.),&quot; than had been reported as missing, (c.) The admission that some of the exchanged prisoners of war have never been reported as prisoners or missing.(3.) The Verdun casualties during the months of February, March, April, and May have been reported with such incompleteness that the official lists cannot be accepted in estimating the casualties in the fighting before Verdun at the present time.The following, instances may be noted in this connection with reference to casualties reported up to the 19th May, 11)16 : The 2nd Landwehr Division attacked, together with the 11th Bavarian Division, north-east of Bois d&apos;Avocourt on the 20th March. The 11th Bavarian Division, although Bavarian casualties are proverbially belated, had reported 60 per cent, casualties, but 2nd Landwehr Division had reported only 6 per cent.The Vllth Reserve Corps had been fighting since the attack began on the 21st February. Yet up to the 19th May two battalions had reported no casualties at all.The Vth Reserve Corps attacked the village and fort of Vaux on the 9th March  yet one regiment had only just (the 19th May)&apos; returned casualties for one of its battalions, the other two battalions still showing no casualties. Another regiment had returned less than 150 casualties per battalion for the whole of the fighting.Two regiments of the Illrd Corps had published no losses incurred since the end of February and the- first days of March, though this corps was very heavily engaged on the 8th and the 9th March and had to be withdrawn to refit.An examination of the lists up to the 31st May gives additional evidence of this abnormal retardation.(4.) The Bavarian lists, especially in the Verdun fighting, are liable to more drastic criticism. They rarely disclose, or even purport to disclose, the full losses of any unit. The practice of the Bavarian authorities seems to be to dole out day by day small instalments of some twenty to * one hundred men, as though the Bavarian population could not be expected to bear the full disclosure of the losses at one blow.There is thus evidence of retardation in the returns beyond what is normal and inevitable, and it would be difficult to assert that in such cases as those noted in (3) and (4) above this retardation is not deliberate and intentional. If this is admitted, the question arises what amount of allowance should be made in our calculations for this abnormal retardation. We are unfortunately unable at present to answer this question, and we can only say that it is possible, though not probable, that the percentage to be added on this account is so small as to be negligible.One of the strongest arguments in favour of the general trustworthiness of the German casualty lists is the fact that those, including some members of our Committee, who have since the beginning of the war been engaged in practical work involving close examination and scrutiny of the official lists have been led to form an opinion, varying however in confidence, in favour of their credibility, although they were at the outset disposed to disbelieve in them. The following are some of the reasons which have led them to attach credence to the official lists : (a.) The meticulous details furnished in the lists. Each additional detail, it is con-tended, makes the work of falsification more difficult and the work of detection more easy, and it can serve no useful purpose unless the lists are intended for a true official record.(o.) The steady ratios and percentages running through the lists from month to month.(c.) The unnecessary disclosure of mistakes, e.g.: (i.) The appearance of supplementary lists (&quot; Nachtrage&apos;&apos;). Such lists are quite unnecessary. The relations of the. men included in them must be in possession of the information contained in them before they appear, and we could not detect the absence of the names included in them from the original lists if this information was not afforded by the &quot;Nachtrage&quot; themselves.[722-1]D
(il) The publication of the lists of returned prisoners with references to the lists in which the names of those prisoners had previously appeared, or, where they had not appeared (if any), the disclosure of that fact.(iii.) The abundant corrections, the tendency of which is to present a more unfavourable picture of the state of the German army than that disclosed by the original lists.(d.) The breakdown of many of the destructive criticisms put forward. In early days these were based upon the improbability of the ratio of wounded to killed which, as it was suggested, ought to have been at least 8 to 1. The whole experience of the war has shown that, while the ratio shown in the lists appears to be smaller than - in the English or French armies, there is no such divergence between these experiences as would justify this criticism. Again, at one period the nominal list of the prisoners in a particular regiment held in England was compared with the missing disclosed in that regiment by the lists. At first nearly 50 per cent, of the prisoners in England were unaccounted for in the lists; but a further search disclosed that 80 per cent, of those at first unaccounted for were entered under the heading of the &quot; reserve regiment&quot; of the same number. The search was then stopped, as it was taking time and the point was considered disposed of.(e.) The very heavy losses in particular units often disclosed in one list or in a succession of lists following one another at close intervals and accounting in some cases for something like the whole strength of a battalion.The general opinion, therefore, of. those who have put forward the above reasons is that the lists must be taken as having sufficient intrinsic weight to justify treatment similar to that accorded to any historical document. That is to say, they are liable to be modified by the results of experience obtained aliunde or to be displaced altogether by the discovery of any facts which would disprove them. But, after the most diligent search and the application of all possible forms of criticism of figures, no such disproof of their general truth has yet been furnished.Other members of the committee hesitate to subscribe to this conclusion in its entirety. They are, of course, at one with their colleagues in discrediting the wildly exaggerated estimates of enemy losses which at one time obtained currency. But they cannot disguise from themselves that it would necessarily be an object of great importance to the German Government to prevent a knowledge of the exact wastage of the army reaching the Allied staffs, and that it would be quite in accordance with their known tactics to make every effort to create a false impression of their losses with a view not only to misleading the Allies, but also to preventing depression at home. The reasons given in (a) and (b) above do not appear to these members to show that deliberate falsification, if undertaken, could necessarily be detected. They are not convinced, after putting the question to Mr. J. Burn, actuary of the Prudential Assurance Company, who is familiar with the lists, that a systematic omission of, say, for instance, every fifth name from the lists as published need affect the steadiness of the ratios and percentages. They note that a figure of total casualties has been confidentially communicated to the War Office considerably higher than the total given by the official lists. The Committee, however, is not in possession of any intrinsic evidence of falsification nor of any manipulation of the lists beyond such cases of abnormal retardation as have been mentioned above ; and they are agreed that the official casualty lists afford the only definite information available on this point, and that these lists may be accepted with certain corrections and additions (which constitute an admission of the incompleteness of the statistics as to the number of wounded) as the basis of a minimum estimate.Premising that, for the reasons given above, the German casualty lists published since the beginning of the Verdun fighting afford but little reliable basis for estimate, &quot;we would assume that: (a.) The normal delay in publication may amount to something between six weeksand two months.   The latter period has been taken for the purposes of thefollowing calculation. (o.)* To the nximber of killed and died of wounds should be added the differencebetween the number of prisoners held by the. Allies and the number ofprisoners and missing acknowledged in the lists.* The figure so arrived at will be, if anything, an underestimate rather than an overestimate, as from the lists themselves it can be argued with certainty that there are prisoners in the hands of the Allies who have never been reported under the heading of any casualty in the German casualty lists. On the other haad, the numher of deserters is very ssoall.
(c.) The permanent loss by deaths from sickness and by invaliding for sickness and wounds from the army in the field should be calculated by applying to the total of killed plus died of wounds thejBritish ratio of permanent loss to killed plus died of wounds.(d.) The number of died of sickness and invalided for sickness among the troops on lines of communication and in the depots should be obtained by applying British percentages of strength.(e.) The floating loss, men temporarily unavailable, should be calculated by applying British percentages of strength.We may here emphasise the point that the total thus arrived at is made up in part by the process of estimation. It is possible that there may be such a difference between German experience on the one hand and French and British experience on the other, as to render the estimates untrustworthy. The methods of discipline in the German army may have resulted in a lower sickness ratio than the British, but it is also possible that the rigorous climate and insanitary conditions of Russia, Poland, and the Carpathians may have had the effect of making the German sick-rate in those districts higher than on the British front in France and Flanders. It is possible also that the total strength of the German army taken for the purpose of-calculation is inaccurate. The total, therefore, must be looked upon as the best estimate that can be formed rather than as a confident statement. In particular, the large addition of wounded, in consequence of the adoption of the ratio basis, is only hypothetical.The total German net casualties up to the end of January 1916, i.e., during eighteen months of war, can then be calculated from the totals given in the official casualty lists published up to the .31st March, 1916. The totals required are as follows : Killed and died of wounds ... ... ...      642,531Prisoners        ... ... ... .......      129,891Missing ... ... ... ... ...      203,597Following the above assumptions :  *(a.) The allowance for normal retardation. The total net German casualties are calculated up to the end of January 1916 from the totals given in the official lists published up to the 31st March, 1916.(6.) The total of prisoners and missing is 333,488. The total of prisoners held by the Allies is 179,380 ; therefore the difference to be added to the total of killed and died of wounds = 154,108. The total of killed and died of wounds may therefore be taken as 800,000 (642,531 plus 154,108).(c.) The British ratio of permanent loss to killed plus died of wounds is shown by figures supplied to us by the War Office to be 1*35 to 1 (men who are retained in the army though no longer fit for service at the front are included in permanent loss). Neglecting the difference caused by the fact that the German army has been much more nearly stationary in numbers than the constantly increasing British army as unlikely seriously to affect the calculation, the German permanent loss from the army in the field may therefore, be taken as 1,080,000.(d.) According to British statistics, of the 2,000,000 men on the lines of communi-cation and in depots in Germany :-1,000 a month will die, %.e:, for 18 months    ... ...      18,0001,320 a month will be invalided, i.e., for 18 months     ...       23,760Total ... ... ...      41,760(e.) The floating loss, men temporarily unavailable, consists of : -(i.) Temporarily unfit from sickness and wounds from the army in the field(strength, 4,000,000). (ii.) Temporarily unfit from sickness from the men on lines of communication(strength, 1,000,000), and in the depots (strength, 1,000,000).

This will represent the number of militarily fit men from which the requirements of industry in Germany, have to be met, a subject which is discussed in the following section.Men Kemaining in Industry in Germany.We have seen that out of the 14,202,000 Germans of military age (classes 1889-1917) over 3,000,000 (ie., 2,864,000 -f-148,000 rejected from class 1917) were, on the French analogy, not mobilized, presumably mainly on account of physical unfitness for military service. Among these 3,000,000 would be included invalids, lunatics, cripples, and other unemployables, but the great bulk could be employed in industries. There are in addition some 900,000 at ages 47 to 50, and between 50 and 70 some 4,000,000, besides boys of from 14 to 18 numbering 2,700,000. Thus we have a total, excluding-the 1,700,000 mobilizable men, of 10,600,000 of all ages inore or less available for industry, so long as the military age is not extended. This number is rather less than half (49 percent.) of the number of males aged 14 70 in the empire, which may be taken, to represent approximately the number of occupied males of.all ages.* t.*., 2,102,000, plus four times 116,750.f The figure estimated by the Admiralty is 150,000, including 40,000 to 45,000 serving as a naval corps in Flanders.  Naval casualties are estimated at about 40,000, and have not been included in items 4 and 5.
It will be of interest to compare these proportions with the figures for France.In France, under peace conditions, the number of males engaged in occupations, after deducting about 600,000 for the army and navy, would appear to be about 13,000,000, out of a total$male population of about 19,600,000, the unoccupied comprising rather over 5,000,000 juveniles and nearly 1,000,000 others, of whom more than 870,000 are over 70. The number 5,000,000 represents males of 14 years of age and under, and the number of such males occupied in industry or commerce may be set off against the number of males above 14 not so occupied.From 18 to 47 there were about 8,320,000 males, and of these it appears that 6 250,000 were called to the colours. Above the age of 47 there were about 700,000 under 50, of whom about 250,000 were serving in the army, and nearly 3,500,000 between 50 and 70, while 1,250,000 were between 14 and 18. There were thus about 7,250,000 over 14 and under 70, excluding those called to the colours, and if we take, as appears reasonable by analogy with either the United Kingdom or Germany, the number between 14 and 70, as representing the number available for occupations (balancing the unoccupied at these ages against the occupied below and above the age limits namedj, we find that there remained in France for the industrial service of the country, about 56 per cent, of the number of males needed during peace time.Thus in France it appears that there remains about 56 per cent, of the pre-war male labour in industry as against 49 per cent, in Germany, assuming both countries to have mobilized their males of military age to the same extent, from which, it would appear that the deficiency of male labour may be greater in Germany. The difference is accounted for by the different&apos;age constitution of the two countries, and the much larger proportion of males over military age in France. The difference in the economic conditions of France and Germany is such, in our opinion, that France should be able to spare a larger proportion of men from industry. The demand for labour in France has been reduced both by reduction of exports and by the importation of goods ordinarily produced at home. French exports have been reduced by one-half in value and consequently by over one-half in amount; and France is able to import such goods as iron and steel, woollen fabrics, coal, &amp;c. By the use of the Allied credit abroad she is able to import freely much more than she is obliged to export in exchange. Thus whereas France economises man-power both by diminished production for export and by increase of imports for home consumption, Germany&apos;s gain in respect of diminished production for export is offset by the necessity for increased production for home consumption of goods or substitutes for goods ordinarily obtained abroad. Unlike France, moreover, she has to produce all the coal and iron required for munitions.While, however, it is probable that the industrial requirements of Germany may call for the retention of a number of men of military age and capacity greater than the calculation on the basis of French experience would suggest, it must be remembered that there are in Germany some 2,500,000 prisoners of war who are freely used for industrial work,* that there may be from 300,000 to 500,000 Italian labourers (see Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s report of the 6th April, 1916), and other migratory labour which may have been retained in the country at the outbreak of war or been attracted since, and that citizens of occupied territories may be drawn upon for this - purpose. This is certainly being done in the case of the Poles, male and female.There are, indeed, indications that, in spite of her greater labour requirements, Germany may not have found it necessary to retain a much larger proportion of men of military age in industry than France.Certain reports of Social Democratic trade unions in Germany, relating to a large population and giving statistics of the reduction of membership owing to mobilization, have been summarised for us by Mr. Wotzef, of the Board, of Trade. The statistics show that in the builders&apos; union a membership of 309,562 in June 1914 had been reduced to 82,983 in December 1915-a reduction of 73 per&apos; cent.; for printers, the* Appendix to Reichstag memorandum on Economic Measures, March 1916-: &quot; With a view to keeping industries going as far as.-possible;, and in particular to safeguard the food supply, it has been found increasingly necessary to resort to the labour of prisoners of war (Prussia only):_In works of public utility. ...       .,. ,       ., ... ... 86j000&apos;In agriculture ... .. .. ...       .... ,       ...       339,000-In industry    .. .. .. .. .. ..        244,000Total        .... j     ... ... ..       669,000In addition, 250,000 are employed on lines of communication.&quot;[722-1] E
corresponding numbers are 70,452 and 31,140 reduction of 56 per cent.; for wood workers 184,896 and 66,323, reduction 64 per cent.; for metal-workers, 506,506 and 223,060, reduction 56 per cent., while for a total of 1,349,267 in all the Unions for which returns at about the end of 1915 could be obtained^the reduction was 63&apos;4 per cent. This reduction has occurred notwithstanding a &quot;considerable influx of new members ; and as it applies to total membership at all ages, the reduction at the military ages would obviously be much greater. These figures, therefore, appear to us to indicate that all, or almost all, the men of military age must have been mobilized, although it does not follow that all of these are with the colours [e.g., the metal-workers].We are thus led to the conclusion that, apart from the fact that there would be a readiness and a determination to endure the privation consequent on an extreme diversion of men from the service of the civil population, there is no reason to suppose that, except for indispensable men with special qualifications, Germany must retain in civil life any very considerable number of males fit for military service. Only those need be kept who are essential in their civil occupation because of its demands upon their physique or skill. In view of the character of certain industries, the maintenance of which is essential for the supply of war material, the reservation of a substantial number of such men would appear to be necessary. In coal-mining much of the underground work requires both technical training and physical fitness, and it may be supposed that a substantial proportion of the workers must be Germans. Some of the work at blast furnaces and in steel works makes a similar demand on the strength and skill of the worker and calls for trustworthy men. In engineering establishments, in cases where the work calls for skill and experience, trained workmen cannot wholly be dispensed with, even though those available be fit for military service, and the same consideration applies to some of the processes of the manufacture of chemicals.In this connection it may be noted that, in mining, metal (including engineering) and chemical industries, and in transport (railways, posts, and tele-graph) there were employed, at the date of the last industrial census in 1907, about 3j700,000, of whom not more than 600,000 were above the military age limit and over 500,000 were under 19, and thus unlikely to be qualified by experience for work of considerable responsibility. Nearly 2,600,000 were within the age limits for military service, and the growth of these industries since 1907 would add considerably to this number. Even though industrial fitness and military fitness are not identical, and though men unsuited for the army by age or physical condition may fill some of the positions requiring trustworthiness and training, and involving considerable strain and fatigue, some men of military fitness must be retained in industry. There are, moreover, both in administration and in industry generally, certain men whose services cannot in any circumstances be dispensed with, and whose numbers, though impossible to estimate, must be considerable., In judging of the numbers of men of military age who may be required for munition work and other work directly connected with military operations, some assistance may be derived from a consideration of the French experience. We have been informed that the number of &quot; militaires detaches &quot; in French establishments working for national defence on the middle of April was 435,295, an increase of about one-half on the corresponding number at the beginning of the year. If similar work in Germany requires no more in proportion to the numbers with the colours than in France, at least 750,000 will be needed. It is not clear whether the French figure includes workers in shipbuilding yards, but, in order to avoid the risk of undue inflation of the number of indispensable men of military fitness in industry, we assume that these workers are included. We must also take account of the much larger requirements of the mining and metallurgical industries in Germany than in France. Not only are those requirements larger at ordinary times, but the occupation of important parts of the coal-mining and iron working districts of France has brought about a greater diminution in the production in that country than has occurred in Germany. The quantity of coal produced in Germany has been decreased by about one-quarter since the outbreak of war, and the output of iron is now about one-third less, and that of crude steel about one-sixth less, than was the case -two years ago; but the reduction in the coal and iron produced in France has been much greater in proportion. As already noted, moreover, while Germany must rely on the output of the workshops and factories in that country and in the occupied territories, France is able to draw upon the manufacturing resources of other countries, and thus to devote more of her men to the direct work of the army.
Taking into consideration, then, the numbers of men required for munitions other than those employed in the factories, such as coal, iron, and transport workers, and the necessity in every highly organised community to1 retain, in all circumstances, a number of skilled men at their special work, whether in industry or administration, we feel that the number of men fit for military service who must be retained in civil occupations cannot be estimated at less than 1,000,000, and in all probability exceeds that figure. The minimum figure would leave some 700,000 men out of the 1,700,000 shown on page 12 still available to be drawn into the army, but whether all or any of these are in fact available it is in our opinion quite impossible to determine.We have not lost sight of the fact that the balance of 1,700,000 represents the effect of summing items, each one of which is in greater or less degree conjectural. If there were no evidence in confirmation, of its approximate correctness we should feel that the uncertainties in the calculations on which it is based are so serious as to involve a very wide margin of error. We conceive, however, that such confirmation is afforded by the information available of the extent to which Germany is using her youngest classes, and especially by the figures quoted showing the fall in membership of German trade unions. In view of this evidence, and of the fact that we have endeavoured throughout (notably in our assumption of the substantial correctness of the German casualty lists) to give the enemy, if anything, the benefit of the doubt, we feel some assurance that the number in question cannot be very much more than 1,700,000. It may, of course, be considerably less. If this number is not an under-estimate, we think it highly improbable that so many as 700,000 could be spared from it for the army, 1,000,000 representing a minimum estimate of the numbers who must, in any event, be retained for the production of munitions and other industrial and administrative purposes.It follows, moreover, if these opinions are correct, that no substantial increase of military strength could now result from raising the age of service so as to include older men; for it can only be the fittest of men over 47 who would be of real service in the army, and the extent to which further men of good physical capacity can be withdrawn from German industry must now be very limited.Outside the classes 1889 to 1917 the further resources of Germany in personnel may be estimated as follows : *The 1918 class (lads attaining 18 years of age during 1916) who have beenmustered and who will probably be called up during the summer   ..      500,000The 1919 class who are being enrolled in the Landsturm as they reachtheir 17th birthday, and may eventually produce another .. ..      500,000By extending the military age to 50 a male population of some 950,000 would be rendered available, and an extension from 50 to 55 would add another ] ,400,000, but, in view of the considerations mentioned above, the number of serviceable recruits available from this iource cannot well be greater than   .. .. .. .. ..      500,000Our conclusion is that Germany had at the end of May 1916 the following reserves, which may be expected to take the field during the calendar year : In depots ... ... ... ... ...   1,000,0001918 class       ...... ...  *     ......     500,0001,500,000This figure is a minimum. It is possible that it may have to be increased by 700,000 (men released from industry) and, if the age limit is increased, by a further 500,000.The maximum figure is therefore 2,700,000.If the war lasts until the spring of 1917, a further 500,000 men from the 1919 class will become available.As far as mere numbers are concerned it would thus appear that if the permanent loss by casualties should continue at the same rate.as during the first eighteen months of the war, the reserves available will suffice to enable those losses to be made good for more than a year, and, possibly, for two years.Summary of Conclusions.1. The best test of the number of men who can be found for military service in Germany is the number found by France under similar conditions.    The latter
number is stated at 6,000,000 for classes 1889-1916 in a secret memorandum of the French War Office dated 15th March, 1916.2. The figure so arrived at for Germany, after making due allowance for the difference in age constitution between the two populations, is 11,200,000, aged 18-47 last December (classes 1889-1917).3. This estimate is confirmed by one prepared for us by Sir A. Watson, which, on the basis of invaliding from the service of the British post office, arrives at an almost identical result. It appears, therefore, that this figure substantially represents not only the number of men in Germany mobilizable on the French analogy, but the total number of men of military age and fitness.4. This estimate is confirmed also by the fact that it harmonizes with what we know of German expenditure of men to date (numbers under arms and casualties) and of the resulting depletion of the civil population (trades union returns).5. Of these 11,200,000, the War Office estimates that 6,200,000 are with the colours and fit for service at the present time, either at the fronts (4,000,000), on lines of communication (1,000,000), training in depots (1,000,000), or in the navy (200,000, including casualties) ; and this estimate, which is practically identical with that of the French General Staff, we have accepted without question, having no means of checking it. The balance of 5,000,000 must be accounted for either as casualties or as a reserve of men fit for military service but remaining in industry.6. The estimation of German casualties is a very difficult matter, as to which considerable difference of opinion exists. In the absence of anything amounting to proof that the German casualty lists are falsified, we have felt bound to accept them at their face value, except in so far as all their critics admit them to be incomplete. Thus it appears to be common ground that there is an average delay of six weeks to two months in the publication of casualties, that deaths from disease and deaths in civil hospitals are not fully reported, and that the report of losses incurred around Verdun is as yet very incomplete.7. We have therefore framed our estimate as follows : (a.) We take the number of prisoners in the Allied hands ;(b.) After making allowance for the number of missing not accounted for as prisoners, we accept the German statement of killed and died of wounds up to the 31st March as representing the facts to the 31st January;(e.) We apply the British ratio of permanent loss from other causes to the number of killed and died of wounds arrived at under (6) ;(d.) We estimate the loss of the four months February to May as equal to the average for the previous eighteen months ;(e.) We estimate the wastage amongst troops not at the front in the light of British experience.This brings the total calculated permanent loss to 2,600,000 at the end of May.8. The floating or temporary loss of men incapacitated by wounds or sickness, but who will ultimately become fit for service at the front, has been calculated to amount for an army of the size of Germany&apos;s to 700,000. This estimate is founded on the British experience that the temporarily unfit from wounds and sickness amounted at a recent date to 16&quot;25 per cent, of the army in the field, and, in view of the heavy fighting recently undertaken by the German army, the real figure in its case may well be higher.9. The deduction of these allowances of 3,300,000 in all for casualties from the 5,000,000 fit Germans.to be accounted for leaves 1,700,000 as our estimate of the number of fit men not yet under arms from the classes 1889 to 1917. Of this number we estimate, in the light of the special labour requirements and resources of Germany at the present time, that at least 1,000,000, and very possibly the whole, must in any circumstances be retained in. industry, including dockyards and munition factories.10. Germany would appear to have had at the end of May 1916 the following:&apos; reserves, which may be expected to take the field during the calendar year: In depots   -     ...        ... ...        ...        ...   1,000,000. 1918 class _____   ____^      ... ... ...     500,0001,500,000This figure is a minimum. It is possible that: it may have to be increased by 700,000 (men released from industry), and, if the age hmit is increased, by a further 500,000. J     : *The maximum figure is therefore 2,700,000.
If the war lasts until the1 spring of 1917, a further 500,000 youths from the 1919 class will become available. We understand that these figures are in close agreement with the estimate of the Director of Military Intelligence of the 24th April,11. Every item in our calculations is open in greater or less degree to question, and it is, therefore, chiefly because the various items appear to be consistent with each other and to produce a result which appears to be in agreement with such knowledge of the labour position in Germany as we have obtained that we are enabled to regard these conclusions with some confidence&apos; as an approximation to the truth.Tabular Summary of Conclusions as to German Personnel on May 31.German Males Aged 18-47 on December 31, 1915 (Classes 1889-1917 inclusive).At the front      ...         ...      - ...         ...         ... 4,000,000On lines of communication           ...          ...          ... 1,000,000In depots in Germany     ...          ...          ...          ... 1,000,000In the navy (including naval casualties)       ...          ... 200,000Permanent casualties      ...         ...         ...         ... 2,600,000Other casualties involving temporary incapacity        ... 700,000Mobilizable men necessarily retained in industry, at least 1,000,000 Mobilizable men remaining in industry but not indis-pensable, at most     ...         ...&quot;        ...         ... 700,000Men who cannot be mobilized, mainly on account ofunfitness    ...         ...         ...         ...         ... 3,000,00014,200,000Outside tbese ages the 1918 class (present age 17-1to is now wholly, and the 1919 class (present age 16^ to VJ\) partially, liable for service. Each of these may yield 500,000 within the next twelve months. The extent to which men older than 47 can be recruited is very doubtful, but could hardly in any event exceed 500,000.June 26, 1916.Part II.-Austria-Hungary.IN the absence of special indications to the contrary, we have thought it best to frame our estimate for Austria and Hungary as far as possible on similar lines and assumptions to those adopted in the case of Germany.Man Power.The classes actually called to the colours by 31st May were those of 1886 to 1918, and it may be convenient therefore to deal in the first place with men of those ages (under 50 and&apos; over 17 on 1st January).The numbers of men at different ages taken as a starting point are those calculated from the results of the census of 1910 for. 1st December, 1915, by assumption of the continuance of the last intercensal rate of increase. This method&apos;of calculation allows for continuation of emigration since 1910 at the same rate as in the years 1901.-1910, an allowance in close correspondence with the facts. We have not been able to use recorded deaths at-each year of age, as in the case of Germany, to estimate increase&apos; since the&apos; census and the results arrived at are no doubt less precise than if this method had been available. In both Austria and Hungary, however, the birth-rate and-death-rate have been falling to ah approximately equal extent; during the past fifteen years, so that there has been little reason for alteration of the rate of increase apart from fluctuations in emigration, -which, as-we have seen,, do not seriously affect the calculation. We believe, therefore, that the estimate, as calculated^-is likely to be-substantially correct. Allowance has been made for foreigners (other than Germans&apos; and Hungarians)&apos; [722-1] F
resident in Austria, and for the return of the considerable number (estimated at 266,487) of Austro-Hungarians resident in Germany. Material for similar allowance for, foreigners resident in Hungary is not available, but probably its application would have but a slight effect upon the result.The deductions made from the census figures on account of the ordinary reasons for non-availability, as applicable also in the case of France and Germany, are those used at the same ages in our calculation for Germany. They represent chiefly physical unfitness. The rate for age (45-50) is calculated on the assumption of increase of such unavailability with age in the same proportion as the German death-rate in 1909-1912, and the deduction of 35 per cent, is made for lads attaining age 18 during the present year, as against 25 per cent, for those ofte year older to allow for their greater immaturity.

It is true that official lists of Austrian casualties are issued, but a tabulation of the information contained in them, which has just been completed for us, confirms the view previously held that they are of no statistical value. As evidence of this, it may suffice to emote the facts that the number of prisoners reported up to the 31st March is 348,102. and that no men are reported as missing. Rather less, that is to say, than one-third of the known number of prisoners appear in these lists. There is therefore no reason for attaching any weight to the correspondingly low totals of 182,760 dead and 816,169 wounded.The War Office estimate of permanent loss by casualties to the 31st May amounts to 2,860,000. Of these we are informed that about 1,100,000 are represented by prisoners, mainly in the hands of the Russians. (The recent Russian captures are, of course, excluded.) Deducting prisoners, the total of permanent loss in other forms would amount to about 1,800,000 as against 2,400,000 estimated for Germany, apart from prisoners. The Austrian army has not, and never has had three-quarters the strength of the German, its ratio to the latter being about 9 : 16 at present, and having been between half and three-quarters throughout the war. The loss estimated for it is therefore somewhat greater in proportion, but hygienic and hospital conditions are probably inferior, and the natural conditions of campaigning more severe for the Austrian army than for the Germans on their Western front. On the whole the estimate supplied to us appears to be reasonably in accordance with the experience of other armies engaged, and we are disposed to adopt it while bearing in mind that the conditions of the case necessarily render it speculative.Temporary wastage is estimated to amount to 400,000. It will be remembered that for Germany this has been calculated in the light of British experience at 700,000. As the strength of the Austrian army at the front is believed to be 2,250,000 as against 4,000,000 in the case of Germany, the estimate appears to be reasonable.
Men Remaining in Industry.We are now in a position to trace the probable disposal of the 11,680,000 men of military age (17-50) in Austria-Hungary. The numbers referring to army strengths have been supplied to us by the Director of Military Intelligence, and may, we under-stand, be accepted with confidence.Forces in the field   -     ...        ........- 2,250,000Lines of communication   ...          ...          .--          ... 550,000In training       ...         ...                                  - 600,000Navy and naval reserves ...         ...         ... 50,000Permanent wastage (dead, permanently disabled, prisonersand missing)          ...         ...         ...         ... 2,860,000Temporary wastage         ...          ...          ... 400,000Mobilizable men remaining in industry      ....... 2,220,000Unmobilizable (see table on p. 18) ...          ....    &apos;    ... 2,750,00011,680,000The menin training on the 31st May, 1916, are stated to have included 400,000 between 43 and 50 years of age, and 200,000 of the class of 1918 (lads in their eighteenth year on the 1st January, 1916) called up in April last, the remaining 138,000 fit lads in this class not yet having been called up.The number of mobilizable men shown on the strength of the estimates quoted as remaining in industry is large as compared with the numbers of fit men necessarily so retained as known for France, and estimated for Germany (1,000,000-1,700,000 estimated for Germany). In view, however, of what is known as to the progress of mobilization in Austria, all classes from 1886 to 1918 having been called up, and the classes 1881-85 warned for service &quot; without arms,&quot; and of the fact that the classes of men aged 24-43 (on the 1st January) are already being revised for the third time, and those aged 19-24 for the second time, it must be supposed that few men between IS and 50 who can be spared for the army now remain in industry, and therefore that any apparent excess in the number under consideration cannot be attributed to any incompleteness of mobilization which the Austrian Government could avoid. As the production of munitions is less proportionately to population than in Germany, and as industry in general is less highly organized, and the proportion of the population engaged in agriculture greater than in that country, it might have been expected that the proportion of fit men who cannot be drafted into the army would be smaller.It must be noted, however, that owing to the smaller number of classes called up in Germany some 954,000* fit men are not included in the total given as available for that country at military age, although the corresponding men in Austria-Hungary, 753,000 in number (see p. 18), are included in the Austrian total. To state the comparison fairly, therefore, we should have to deduct the number of Germans accounted for as in the army or navy or as casualties from a total larger by 954,000 than that employed in arriving at the figure of 1,700,000 fit men remaining in industry. The result of course would be to increase the 1,700,000 by 954,000. In other words, of the Germans fit for service at Austrian military ages, the number remaining in industry may be taken at about 2,654,000, and it is with this number that the 2,220,000 Austrians assumed to be fit for service but not serving must be compared. Making the comparison on these lines the proportion of fit men not accounted for by military service is 24&apos;85 per cent, in Austria as against 21&apos;84 per cent, in Germany.&quot;]&quot;The very fact that Austria has been obliged to include more classes than Germany in her mobilization, suggests that figures showing a smaller proportion of available men mobilized may probably understate this proportion. Of all the facts known as to the position of Austria in regard to personnel, perhaps the most definite is the shortage of men at the present time. This shortage seems scarcely consistent with an excess over Germany, even though but small, in the proportion of men really available for service. But to treat the larger paper proportion shown above for Austria as fact, which has to* The number of. men aged 17-18 (1918 class) in Germany is taken from p. 5 of the Germany report as 668,000, of whom, as in the case of Austria-Hungary (see p. 18), 65 per cent, or 434,000 are assumed to be of military fitness. Men aged 47-50 in Germany are taken at 972,000, of whom on the assumption applied to other age classes 53-55 per cent, or 520,000 may be taken as fit. The fit men aged 17-18 and 47-50 may therefore be estimated to number 954,000.f See also p. 21.
be explained in view of a lower proportion shown for Germany, would be to.attribute a greater degree of reliability to the assumptions made in the present report than we should be disposed to admit. The numbers serving, indeed, are so definitely ascertained as to afford little room for .serious error in this figure. Although it is acknowledged to be difficult to follow the location of the units of the Austro-Hungarian forces, this difficulty does not extend to their enumeration. The number of casualties, on the other hand, is very speculative, and the figure set down may easily be an underestimate. It must be borne in mind also that, owing to the peculiar political circumstances of Austria, the proportion of unmobilizable men may be higher than in France or Germany. Service in the army is intensely repugnant to certain sections of the population, and may be the more difficult to enforce completely on that account-the dual organization of the Empire must tend to duplication of the staffs and diminution of the effectiveness of control and, generally, it is probably safe to assume that organization is laxer and less effective than in Germany. In view, moreover, of what is known as to disaffection, leading to the disbanding of certain battalions and the execution or imprisonment of men belonging to them, this appears to us to be a factor to be borne in mind, as is also the ]oss of recruits to the Austro-Hungarian forces by the occupation of Galicia and the Bukovina by the Allies in 1915. Further, in comparing the proportion of fit men remaining in industry in Germany and Austria-Hungary respectively, considerable weight must be given to the very much smaller numbers of prisoners of war (available for industrial employment) in the last-named Empire. As the numbers involved in such considerations as these are quite indeterminable by any information in our possession, we have refrained from hazarding any estimate of them in our tabular statement.Reserves on May 31, 1916.Numbers under 17 and over 50 on January 1, 1916. The class of 1919 (lads aged 16-17 on the 1st January, 1916) does not become legally liable for service till the 1st January, 1917, but it is conceivable, of course, that the law might be changed or overridden. If this class is called up during the present year, it seems doubtful whether more than half these boys, who are, on an average, only 17 years of age in the middle of 1916, would be found really fit for training with a view to early active service. The total- number in the class may be estimated at about 540,000, so that if it were called out immediately some 270,000 new recruits might be obtained. If this class is left to mature till April next, a year after its predecessor was called up, the number of recruits from it may be put at 75 per cent, of the total, or 405,000. There would by that time have become available also about 10 per cent&apos;, of the 1918 class,, assumed to be unmobilizable for the moment on account of immaturity, amounting; to about 52,000 men, so that the total yield of the young classes in twelve months may be put at about 457,000 men.The classes of 1881-1885, men born in 1861-1865, and so aged 50-55 on the 1st January, 1916, have been warned for service &quot; without arms,&quot; but not yet called up. So far as their service may actually prove to be without arms it does not concern an inquiry into the armed forces of the enemy, while if the attempt is made to arm these men it may be doubted whether they will materially add to the enemy&apos;s strength. Their number is over 1,000,000 (1,072,242 estimated). On the hypothesis of increase of military unfitness with age in proportion to mortality, not more than half of them would be fit for service, and of these no doubt a considerable proportion would prove to be indispensable in their civil occupations. At this period of life, however, it may be taken as certain that the proportion of the militarily unfit increases in higher ratio than mortality. It seems probable, therefore, that not more than 250,000 fit and available men could ever be drafted from these classes into the fighting line, and even then the range of their utility would probably be somewhat limited.Effect of Further Revision. In order to estimate the complete reserves remaining it is necessary to assess at some provisional figure, however slender the basis for doing so,-the additional number to be obtained after the harvest as the result of the further revision of classes 1886-1918 (see p. 19).It is quite impossible to say what yield is to! be expected from this source, but in view oi the facts that for the bulk&apos;of the men concerned this forms the third revision of the recruiting: lists; and&apos; that&apos; Austro-Hungarian&apos;agriculture must be maintained if&apos; the war is to&apos; be prolonged, we tliink it unlikely that more than 150,000 men can be got.   It is conceivable, however, that this number might be exceeded
We -are now in a position to supplement the comparison of proportions of fit men. estimated to be actually mobilized in the two enemy Empires.(see p. 3) by a further comparison of the maximum numbers estimated to be ultimately available. The difficulties of comparison are of course in this ease greatly increased, for much obviously depends upon the policy of the Governments and the temper and resolution of the peoples concerned. Taking the estimates made,, however, of maximum reserves available by the spring of 1917 for what they are worth, we find that of the 14,200,000 Germans aged 18-47 at the end of 1915 (p. 17 of the Gesmany Report), all but 3,000,000 unmobilizable, and 1,000,000 mobilizable men necessarily retained in industry, have been or conceivably may be called to the colours, i.e., 10,200,000 men. To these have to be added 500,000 each from the Classes of 1918 and 1919, and from men aged over 47 [ibid.,]). 17), making 11,700,000 in all. The corresponding figures for Austria-Hungary are 11,680,000 aged 17-50, less 2,750,000 unmobilizable., and 2,220,000 mobilizable men remaining in industry (p. 19), or 6,710,000, to which number have to be added 450,000 youths not.yet called to the colours, 250,000 men over 50 who may be taken for combatant duty,,and 250,000 who may still be withdrawn from industry (see above), making 7,660,000 in all.As the total number of males aged 17-55 -should under peace conditions have been about 17,825,000 in Germany (Germany Jleport, p. 5), and 12,754,000 in Austria-Hungary ; le., 11,682,000 aged 17-50 (p. 18) and 1,072,000 aged 50-55 (p. 20), the maximum numbers estimated as possibly available correspond to 65*6 per cent, of the German and 60 per cent, of the Ahstrian male populatiCn within these extreme limits of military age. The difference does not appear incredible in view of the difficulties in the way of Austrian mobilization&apos;w^&quot;&apos; Tfoe cbm^^ &apos;b&apos;e made in terms&apos; of &quot;the minimum estimates given &quot;ofOtherwise fflobifizable men who^cahnbt^e^sparetl &apos;from industry/&apos;&apos; Stated in st5hi&apos;s&quot;forrn [722-1] ( G-without serious reduction of agricultural efficiency, and it is also oi course conceivable that the Central Powers might determine that the war must be won or lost before- the harvest of 1917, and so resolve to incur the loss in agricultural production involved by calling up now all the fit men still working on the land in Austria-Hungary. In this case the number might be considerably greater than 150,000. We prefer, therefore; to estimate for a possible 250,000 from this revision. If a levy en masse should thus be resorted to as a measure of. desperation, still further recruits, as to whose numbers we can scarcely hazard a guess, might be forthcoming from the classes at present liable to service. But we doubt whether, even in these circumstances, it would be possible to withdraw from industry more than the half-million additional men of or over the present military age already taken into account as possible recruits.Our conclusion is that Austria-Hungary had at the end of May 1916 the following reserves, which may be expected to take the field during the calendar year : In depots Aged 43-50 ... ... ...      400,000Part of 1918 class ... ... ... ...      200,000Available Remainder of 19IS class, say ... ...      150,000Total ... .......      750,000.This figure is a minimum.

the proportional difference between the two countries, is naturally much increased, as the comparison is between the smaller numbers of fit men under no circumstances available for military service instead of the larger numbers of men serving.At ages 17-55 these numbers have been taken at 1,582,000 for Germany, and 2,149,000 for Austria-Hungary.   These figures are made up as follows : Germany.Indispensable men aged 18-47, at least      ...         ... 1,000,000Fit men aged 47-50 (53&apos;55 per cent, of 971,630, p. 5of Germany Report) ...         ...         ...         ... 520,000Fit men aged 50-55 (say 40 per cent, of 1,404,432,ibid., p. 5) ...         ...         ...         ...         ... 562,0002,082,000Less maximum number of men over 47 assumed to beavailable    ... ... ... ... ...     500,0001,582,000AUSTRIA-H UN GARY.Fit men aged 17-50 who are not serving (p. 19) ... 2,220,000 Fit men 50-55 (say 40 per cent, of 1,072,242, p. 20) ...     429,0002,649,000Deduct men of 17-50 assumed as possibly still available(p. 21)      ... ...... ......     250,0002,399,000Deduct men of 50-55 assumed as possibly available (p. 20)     250,0002,149,000It is assumed in making this comparison that all the lads of 17 who are fit for service will be mobilized in each country.In regard to this comparison it should be noted that not only is mobilization likely to be leBS complete in Austria than in Germany for the reasons already stated, but that the figures themselves are not wholly comparable. For owing to the abundant evidence of exhaustion of available men in Austria it has not been necessary as in the case of Germany to allow for the possibility of any large proportion of fit men still remaining in civil life being drafted into the army.&apos; Were it not for this evidence we should have been obliged to contemplate the possibility of recruiting in Austria on a scale of completeness comparable to that reckoned as possible, even if not probable, in Germany, and to have done so would of course have practically done away with the discrepancy between the figures for the two countries.Effect of Losses during June.The character of the fighting since the end of May, however, materially modifies the foregoing estimate of Austrian reserves. We are informed by the Director of Military Intelligence that Austrian permanent losses during June on the Russian and Italian fronts may be taken at about 400,000. At the end of June, therefore, the total reserves, including the 1919 class, as estimated, amounted only to 1,300,000, and the average monthly permanent wastage had increased from 130,000 to 142,000. The reserves estimated would therefore suffice to maintain the army strength for nine months only from the end of June, or until the end of March 1917.Summary of Conclusions.1. The number of Austro-Hungarians who have been or still are available for military service may be calculated, on the same lines as those followed in dealing with Germany, at about ^SO^OO.   This number includes all ages at present liable to
service in Austria, namely, 17-50, and compares with 11,200,000 in Germany at ages 18-47, to which service is at present restricted in that country.2. The number under arms or in training on the 31st May is a well-established figure, but the number of the net casualties up to that date is very doubtful. After a reasonable allowance has been made for casualties, and this number as well as the number now serving has been deducted from the total, 8,930,000, a balance is left of men capable of service, but not yet serving, which appears high in comparison with what is known of the position in Germany.3. Although it might consequently appear that Austria could still call up considerable further numbers of men, there is very strong reason for believing that this is not the case.4. The discrepancy, which is not very serious, may be accounted for by under-estimation of Austrian casualties or by difficulties in mobilization of a political nature.5. However this may be, the extreme measures taken to raise men convince us that Austria had on the 31st May no considerable reserves beyond men already in training, 600,000, of whom 200,000 are lads belonging to the class of 1918, and such other lads of this or younger classes and men over 50 as it may be possible to enrol. The total yield of one year&apos;s contingent of adolescents is probably a little over 450,000, and the number of men over the present military age who could under any circumstances be usefully embodied probably does not exceed 250,000.Austria would therefore appear to have had at the end of May 1916 the following reserves, which may be expected to take the field during the present calendar year : In depots ... ... ... ...     600,000Remainder of 1918 class  ... ... ...    150,000Total.........    750,000This figure is a minimum. It has to be increased to an indeterminable extent by the product of the further revision now taking place, and by men over 50 if the present age limit of military service is increased. It seems unlikely that the yield from either source can be made to exceed 250,000 men. The maximum figure on this supposition may accordingly be put at 1,250,000.If the war lasts until the spring of 1917 a further 450,000 youths from the 1919 class and those immediately senior to it will become available.July 28, 1916.Part III.-Turkey.Original Man Power.IT is impossible to speak with any definiteness of the Turkish resources in personnel, since neither- the population of the country nor the proportion of it available for military service is known, and consequently the various estimates of numbers of available men made by favourably-situated observers differ considerably amongst themselves. The Turkish Government is itself in all probability unaware of its precise resources in personnel, and it is not surprising, therefore, that the whole subject should be very obscure. Turkish estimates of the numbers concerned appear to be very wild and unreliable as reported, whether intentionally so or not, but on the whole there is less divergence between the view of competent non-Turkish observers than might in the circumstances have been expected.There is no census of Turkey. An attempt made in 1906 to take one was generally regarded as a failure, and we are not aware that the results have been published. In the absence of definite information the usually accepted estimate of the Turkish population is about 25,000,000 before the Balkan war (&quot; Almanach de Gotha,&quot; 23,000,000; Colonel TyrrelTs estimate of October 1911, 25,000,000; an American official publication on the &quot; Military System of the Turkish Empire,&quot; 1897,27,688,000). Since the loss of territory due to the war the population is usually taken as about
 0,000,005, or a little more, (Cairo &quot;Handbook of the Turkish Army&quot; and &quot;Whitakcr&apos;s Almanack,&quot; 20,000,000; &quot; Almanach de Gotha,&quot;  0,600,000; &quot; Statesman s Yearbook,&quot; 21,273,900.) In the absence of definite knowledge we believe that the round figure of 20,000,000 may be accepted as being as likely an approximation to the truth as any other. The rate of increase in time of peace is probably quite low. ,By no means the whole, however, of this population is available for recruiting purposes. It seems a well-established fact that few recruits for the fighting line have been.taken from the non-Moslem elements, but what these elements amount to in numbers is doubtful. They have been put as low as 2 to 3 millions, and as high as 7 millions.. To be on the safe side it may be wise to estimate with the Cairo Handbook that 16 out of the 20 millions are Moslems. The Turks have always been chary of arming their Christian subjects. Shortly before the war they were being called up for service, and Christian deserters enrolled at this time were taken by us in Gallipoli, but since the commencement of the war Christians appear to have been recruited only for services not involving the carrying of arms, such as transport and the like. It is difficult to say to what extent these non-combatant Christian recruits are to be reckoned with in considering the military resources of the country. If the whole of the Moslem population were under the control of the Government there is no doubt that it is large enough to maintain the present army without Christian recruits of any kind; but, as this condition is not fulfilled, and every available Moslem is probably being recruited, the use of Christians for supply services must release Moslems for the combatant branches. As, however, the size of the army which can be raised probably depends entirely on the number of Moslems available as fighting recruits, we shall follow the practice adopted by others of dealing with the Moslem population only and excluding the supply and other non-combatant services in our estimate of Turkish army strength. ....        ... ,Even of the Moslem population, however, a very considerable but unknown proportion is not available for military service. It is only by this fact that any of the estimates of total available forces supplied to us can be reconciled with the size of the Moslem population. As the mobilization in 1914 was exceptionally severe, and the principle of universal service has been applied with ever-increasing rigour since the beginning of 1915 (Cairo Handbook, p. 36), and as, moreover, Turkey is not under the necessity of retaining any considerable number of men in civil occupation for the production of armaments or other industrial purposes, it may be assumed that the French proportion of men mobilized to total population, say, 16 per cent., would apply also to Turkey if the Moslem population were fully available. On this basis we might look for a possible 2,560,000 mobilizable men as against less than half this total generally estimated.The highest estimate of mobilizable strength amongst those of competent non-Turkish observers communicated to us is that of the American official publication already referred to. Importance is attached by the War Office to this estimate, which in 1897, and so before the loss of the European and Tripolitan provinces, placed the total possible at 1,580,000. Colonel Cunliffe Owen, in a provisional report on the military resources of Turkey, dated 1912 (p. 90), a proof of which has been supplied to us by the Director of Military Intelligence, says that &quot; sufficient men are easily obtainable to increase the war strength to 1,500,000 or more.&quot; It must be noted, however, that this estimate contemplates enlistment of non-Moslems, as was the practice at the time it was made, and that, in addition, it applied to the provinces lost immediately afterwards, as well as to those occupied by Turkey&apos;s enemies in the present war. Other estimates are 1,300,000 (Chermside, 1891), 1,250,000 (Von der Goltz, 1910), 1,200,000 (Cairo Handbook and present War Office estimate), 1,140,000 (War Office estimate in 1910), 1,100,000 (General Milne, 1905), 1,000,000 (British Military Attache, 1906, also &quot;a Bulgarian estimate in 1905, to which importance is attached by the War Office). These estimates point to a figure much below that dediicible from the size of the Moslem population, and we are therefore disposed to accept the War Office estimate of 1,200,000, or about 1\ per cent. &apos;6&apos;f &apos;the total Moslem population, as fairly focussing the opinions o&apos;f the most competent observers. It is conceivable, however, that, even if this figure correctly represents the number available at ordinary military age, say 19 to 4-5 or 50, it may be increased to 1,500,000 by inclusion of younger recruits than-are custdmary in European armies, for htit only is this policy being applied to some extent in their own case by Turkey&apos;s European controllers, but the Turkish boy is stated to mature early, and to be frequently o&apos;f a strength adequate for military; service at as early an age as 14. &apos;   J &quot;&apos;        ,      - - ....
As to the reason why the mobilizable force is so small in proportion to the population from which it is drawn we can only attribute this to the very imperfect control maintained by the Government over a large proportion of its subjects. Other factors mentioned in this connection are the prevalence of disabling disease, particularly syphilis, in certain provinces, the losses in recent wars (Yemen 90,000, Balkan war 80,000), and the fact that the peasant Turk ages faster than the average European rustic (Cairo Handbook, p. 9). The joint effect of these factors would probably go but a small way towards accounting for such a difference in mobilizable force as that between 1\ per cent, and 16 per cent, of the total Moslem population. It is, moreover, common ground that Governmental control over the southern, or Arab, portion of the Empire is very imperfect, The principal field from which recruits can be drawn is Anatolia, and it seems probable that it is only to the Moslem population of Asia Minor and European Turkey that European mobilization percentages are in any degree applicable. Estimates of the size of this population differ considerably, but it may perhaps be taken at 8,000,000 to 10,000,000.We are informed, however, by Colonel Tyrrell, Military Attache at Constantinople 1909-1913, that even this population is not wholly subject to Government control, and would not be fully productive of troops on the highest European standard. If it were it should yield 1,250,000 to 1,500,000 men, or rather more than the total estimated mobilizable force of the whole Empire. It seems likely, therefore, both that the number of recruits obtainable outside this population is very limited, although the Syrian quota is known to be by no means negligible, and that even the Anatolian population is not so organized as to jdeld recruits on anything approaching the French or German scale. A yield to the extent of 10 per cent, of the total population would, however, be quite consistent with what is known of the facts, and we believe that prior to the present war this, was considered a high proportion, even in the case of well-ordered States. In any case, however, it is evident that there is so little agreement as to the size of the recruitable population, and so little knowledge of the extent to which it-can be mobilized, that attempts to deduce the numbers available for the army from the size of the population are Vain, and that the estimate of 1,200,000 mobilizable men cannot be checked from this point of view.Present Strength.Assuming that Turkey started the war with 1,200,000 men available for the army, the number now remaining chiefly depends on the total net casualtie*s suffered and the size of the annual contingents of lads maturing to military age.The number of casualties is very doubtful, and is probably known but imperfectly to the Turks themselves. The permanent casualties up to a recent date are estimated by the Director of Military Intelligence as follows : Dardanelles      ... ... .......      250,000Caucasus Sinai ... Hejaz ... Yemen Mesopotamia Persian frontier...150,000 1,800 3,000 1,500 77,400 2,500Total       .........      486,200An unstated number of desertions and of deaths from epidemic disease has to be added to this figure.The estimate of loss in the Caucasus, in view of the prolonged and heavy fighting under most severe conditions which has occurred, appears to be very moderate, but we understand that it is, founded upon information supplied by the Russian staff. The figure for the Dardanelles, on the other hand, may appear somewhat high, as it must considerably exceed the permanent loss of the attacking force. The Russian staff, however, whose estimate is the more entitled to respect on account of the moderation of its figure for the Caucasus, places the total, on the strength of information derived from entirely independent sources, as high as 360,000. No doubt,, as disease caused such heavy loss in our own case, its effect upon the Turkish troops opposed to us may have been still more serious. It is to be borne in mind, also, that throughout the greater portion of the campaign, until communication with Germany was opened up, the Turkish supply of shell was limited, which might largely explain a relatively heavy-loss for their troops.[722-1] H
However this may be, trie view that this loss was very heavy prevails amongst the authorities we have teen able tocdhsulf,. &apos;S6 far as ourVvery limited opportunities of judging go, we are disposed to accept the round figure of 500,000 as roughly repre-senting the total wastage to date, including sick arid wounded at present under treatment and permanent loss by desertion.The annual contingents have been estimated to be as high as 200,000, but we are unable to accept this figure, which seems to us quite inconsistent with a mobilizable force of 1,200,000. It seems impossible that the contingent should amount to one-sixth of the total force, when in Germany it is probably only about one-twentieth, and in France even less. Even in ratio to the total population, 200,000 would be above the standard of European records, which show an annual contingent of about &apos;8 to &quot;9 per cent. (&apos;7 in Franco) of the population^ On this basis the contingent to be looked for from 16,000,000 Moslems would be about 130J000, but such an estimate would treat the whole of this population as amenable to Government control. We prefer to estimate from the total mobilizable force rather than from total population since the Considerations which prevent the Turks from mobilizing on the European scale at other ages should also apply in this case. We therefore propose to accept the War Office estimate of 80,000, Turkish statements, some of which place it as high as 300,000, notwithstanding.The number under arms at the present time is the one item in the situation as to which there is some definite statistical information. Fifty divisions are known to the Director of Military Intelligence to exist, each of a strength of 10,000 infantry or less. Taking the number at 10,000, where it is not known to be less, the total comes to 405,000 infantry, the addition of other arms bringing the totalforce, exclusive of recruits under training and of labour supply, sanitary and medical formations, largely manned by Christians, to about 500,000.The situation to be inferred from the foregoing estimates appears to be as follows : Mobilizable force Add two contingents1,200,000 160,000Underarms     ...          ... 500,000Casualties       ...         ... 500,000Navy ...         ...         ... 12,000Reserve (largely untrained) 348,0001,360,000 I 1,360,000*If casualties continue at the rate.of 300,000 a year, the army could be maintained for one and a half to two years longer at the present strength, or if 300,000 additional troops could be obtained by reducing the lower age limit of service, for one year more in addition. The class of 1898 (lads attaining 18 during the present calendar year) has, however, actually been called up. This appears to indicate that the supply of men may be less than that shown above, and limits the possibility of increase by lowering the age limit of service. We understand, moreover, that there is other evidence of difficulty in procuring recruits. If the rate of casualties can be kept up, we therefore think it unlikely that the Turkish army strength can be maintained for more than two years, while shortage of recruits, apart from all the possibilities in other directions, maydead to its reduction at a much earlier date,July 28, 1916.Part IV.-Bulgaria.. Original Man Power.THE population of Bulgaria at the date of the last census, the 31st December, 1910, is returned as 4,337,513. In 1914 it was estimated by the Director of the Bulgarian Statistical Bureau at 4,943,256 (Report of the Registrar-General for 1914;,* It may be suggested that the propprtion should be higher in a country like Turkey, where theaverage age of the.&apos;.population:is probaDlyidwef. Bengal, however, gives a ratio of about -85 and the Philippine Isjands of about ;-86. Only in. Ceylon, ainongst the three Eastern populations tested, does the ratio, 1-05, expeed t&quot;^ European, standard.; and, in. Ceylon for some reason (stated in the census report to be neither infanticide nor reluctance to &quot;give information) there is a very large preponderance of males in the population.
the increase being due in part to the additional territory conquered from Turkey in 1912. The net gain in population resulting from the wars of 1912 and 1913 would appear to be about 375,000, since the total estimated population of Bulgaria increased by 440,000 from 1912 to 1913, and the normal annual increase is about 60,000-70,000. The estimate quoted for 1914 assumes continuance of the rate of increase during 1905-10 notwithstanding the wars of 1912 and 1913, an assumption which we are not in a position to criticise. As the 1914 estimate was for the middle of the year it should be increased by a year and a half s growth, or say. 100,000, to obtain the population at the end of 1915, which would thus be, in round numbers, 5,040,000.The Bulgarian military age is at present 17-47, and the proportion of the population formed by males of this age was in 1905, the latest date for which the information is available, 19&apos;4 per cent. Assuming the permanence of this proportion, the males of military age would have numbered 978,000 at the end of 1915. It appears doubtful, however, whether a fair proportion of men aged 47-49, and even older, are not in fact serving. The number in the three years of life 47-50 would be about 65,000, so it would seem that about 1,000,000 men, or if anything a trifle more, are of age for service in Bulgaria on the assumption that the age distribution of the population remains as in 1905. The wars of 1912 and 1913 have of course, however, affected this matter. We are informed that the permanent loss in men suffered by Bulgaria in these wars was 35,000 to 40,000 men. These have all to be deducted in estimating the present military population even though they may not all be dead. Taking&apos; their number at 35,000 to allow for the recuperative effect of the lapse of time, the total at ages 17-47 thus becomes 943,000, and the total men of age for service a little under 1,000,000.From this number deduction has to be made for the Moslem element in the population, since the evidence is that, though a few Moslems may be serving as combatants, this is quite exceptional. Moslems are, however, probably used freely for non-combatant services, and so render more Bulgars available for the righting ranks.The proportion of the Bulgarian population which speaks Turkish is returned as 11*63 per cent, in 1910. In the absence of census information as to religion this figure must be taken as indicative of the proportion of Moslems in the population of Bulgaria before the additions of territory in 1913. As the men aged 17-47 in the newly-acquired territory should number about 72,000, the total to which the proportion 11-63 per cent, is applicable becomes 943,000 - 72,000, or 871,000. Deduction of Moslems reduces this number to 770,000, to which number addition must be made for the available men amongst- the 72,000 in the new provinces. We understand that in the main these are not Bulgars, though there is an appreciable Bulgarian element, especially in the neighbourhood of Strumnitza. The other chief ingredients in this population are Greek and. Turkish, but in view of information just received from Salonika that all non-Moslems are being made to serve, the Greeks must be included as largely available. It seems proper to assume, therefore, that 40,000 men may be obtainable from this population, bringing the total estimate for ages 17-47 to 810,000.The stages by which this figure is derived may be summarised as follows : Total population 31st December, 1915        ... ...    5,040,000Males 17-47 ^ 19&quot;4 per cent.       ... ... ...      978,000Deduct loss in wars of 1912-13    ... ... ...       35,000943,000Deduct Moslems in old population (11*63 per cent.)   ...      101,000842,000Deduct Moslems, &amp;c, in new population, say ...        32;000810,000As some addition has probably to be made to this number for men over the age of 47 who are serving, we may say that, so far as age and religion are concerned, the number of males liable to service is 800,000 to 850,000.Present Resources in Men.Physical Unfitness. To obtain an estimate of the number of men at present available for military service, deduction must first be made for those physically unfit for service.   The proportion which could not be mobilized in France,^almost entirely, [722-1] I
&apos;It&apos; is[believed, in -consequence^of ^physicalI unfitness, has beenf shown to be about 21*76 per cent, at ages 19-47, and inclusive of the two -years 17-19 would no doubt somewhat Increase&apos; this percentage. On the other; hand, it&apos;would probably be; unsafe to assume1 unfitness -to-be&quot;&apos;as: cOmmOn-amOngst a hardy-race of agriculturists as in France, even-though7 the: same description may1 apply toa large section of the French population. There is a possibility, moreover, that some appreciable proportion of the French percentage is due to causes other than physical unfitness.Fortunately there is a certain amount of evidence as to Bulgarian experience. The number of rejections for &quot;unfitness.from recent annual contingents is said to have been about 4,500 a year. As the classes have only during the last two or three years numbered as much as 40,000, these rejections may perhaps be taken as representing 12 per Cent, of the total class. On the assumption of &quot;increase of unfitness with age in proportion to mortality, 12 per cent, at age 20 would correspond to about 17-1 percent, at 17-47, making some-slight allowance for immaturity in the first two years, 17-19. This accords sufficiently well with general experience to be accepted as a probable ratio.   The deduction from 810,000 men on this basis would be 142,000.; Information has been received that the Bulgarian authorities have called up for re-examination some 90,000 men previously rejected as unfit. It is not known, however, how many of them have now been passed for service. It would be pure guess-work, therefore, to make any deduction on their account from the estimated number of unfit, and, as estimates of fit and available men must assume a certain more or less fixed standard of fitness&apos;,5 it appears unnecessary to take into account recruits obtained by going below1 this standard. The French standard, with which comparison has been made, is known to be a low one, and, as the number, 142,000, is considerably less than would result from the application of the French proportion, it appears to us to be unnecessary to reduce it on account of the revision of these 90,000 previously rejected &apos;men.Army Strength. The present strength of the Bulgarian army, including 42,000 recruits of the 1-918 class under training, is estimated by the War Office as at most 430,000 men. &apos; It is very possible that it may be somewhat below this figure, but it is believed that it cannot exceed it. Of these, perhaps some 20,000 Macedonians from the newly-occupied territories are:distributed throughout the divisions of the Bulgarian army; but principally in the Macedonian division. The number from Bulgaria proper 0 may therefore1 be-taken as !410,000.- Casualties. The permanent loss from casualties is estimated by the War Office at 90,000 C&apos; 85,000 to 100,000 &quot;). This figure would include the losses of the eleventh or Macedonian division, which;are believed to have been relatively heavy. Assuming 10,000 permanent Macedonian casualties in this division, which probably never had an effective strength of more than 25,000, the Bulgarian casualties are reduced to 80,000.The-floating loss from casualties of atemporary nature is probably best estimated, as for the German army,! as- a proportion&apos; of the total strength at the front. The proportion Calculated from British experience was 16*25 per cent., which, on 415,000 men, would mean 67,000 temporarily incapacitated. It is true that for some months the Bulgarian army has done comparatively little fighting, so that the proportion of wounded may be below average, but, on the other hand, it is believed that there has been a good deal of sickness, infectious and other, and that many of the troops are at present suffering from want of sufficient food. It appears reasonable, therefore, to assume that the wastage from this source may amount to 50,000.Men retained in Industry. Work on; munitions, railways, and other necessary civilian services is estimated by the War Office to demand the services of 60,000 men, who would otherwise be available for military duty. This estimate, amounting to about 7*3 per cent.-of the Christian population of military age, would appear moderate were it not for the existence of the Moslem population. In the wars of 1912 and 1913, however,, we understand, that it was found necessary to employ 50,000 Christians for these purposes, and the requirements appear likely to be greater now than then, --especially for-railway-purposes. - Not-only &apos;has Bulgaria to find labour now for : running the Serbian railways but for a considerable amount of railway construction which is being undertaken. Iti-w6uld - seem, however,that, for this latter purpose at least, Moslem labour should be largely available. Requirements in these directions appear likely to increase somewhat&apos; with the withdrawal of German skilled labour and superintendence, which is now taking place.
We are now in a position to see how far the estimated 810,000 Bulgarian male Christians of military age can be accounted for.   The figures are as follows : Army (including men in training)          ... ... ... 410,000Permanent casualties   ...          ...          ... ... ... 80,000Other casualties, involving temporary incapacity ... ... 50,000Mobilizable men necessarily retained in industry ... ... 60,000Men unfit for military service    ...          ... ... ... 140,000Total    ... ... ...        740,000There thus appear to remain unaccounted for 70,000 men aged 17-47, and, in addition to these as a further possible reserve, such men over 47 as are fit for service. All the evidence, however, points to exhaustion of reserves having already been reached. We feel that this evidence, which is, we understand, of considerable importance, must outweigh the comparatively small paper surplus resulting from our calculations. The conditions are evidently such that this surplus may easily result from errors in our assumptions. For instance, it may well be the case that although all non-Moslems are by law liable to serve, it has not proved possible in practice to compel the service of the whole of the non-Bulgarian Christians, especially in the newly added territories. At the census of 1910, the proportion of the Bulgarian population speaking languages other than Bulgarian or Turkish was returned as 7T4 per cent.It should be stated, in conclusion, that the evidence is against the possibility of further recruiting in Macedonia, as it has proved impossible to maintain the strength of the Macedonian division. Bulgarian reserves would therefore appear to be limited to the 1918 class in training, 42,000, and a doubtful number of men over 47 not at present serving, possibly amounting to 50,000 more.It must be remembered, however, that the proportion of the Bulgarian army available for actual fighting is higher than it otherwise would be on account of the services, such as transport and railway construction, which can be rendered by the Moslem and Macedonian populations, as well as, probably, by the 50,000 Serbian prisoners estimated to be in Bulgarian hands.(Signed) BERNARD MALLET (Chairman).JOHN BROWNLEE.
