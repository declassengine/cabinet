Printed for the use of the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1916.SECRET. G-94TGUNS PGR MERCHANT SHIPS.I. Minute by the Minister of Munitions. II. Minute by Mr. Charles Ellis, D.G.O.S., Minister of Munitions.AT the meeting of the War Committee on the 2nd November (see Conclusion 6 of War Committee Paper, W.C. 81), I undertook to make enquiries and to confer with the Admiralty as to the possibility of increasing the supply of guns for merchant ships. I circulate a minute on the subject by Mr. Charles Ellis, D.G.O.S., Ministry of Munitions. , - nE. S. M.November 6, 1916.II.The Minister.A meeting with the armament firms was held to-day attended by the Admiralty and Colonel Martel. Without interfering with existing orders for the Ministry, the following additional 12-pr. 12-cwt. guns were promised : 1917.	Coventry.	Beardmore.	Tickers.	Total.March	1			1April	8	12		20May	15	12		27June	18	12		30July ..      ..	18	12	50	80August	18	12	50	- 80September	18	12	50	80October	18	12	50	80November	18	12	50	80December	18	12	50	80Total  ..	150	108	300	558Armstrongs and Woolwich are unable to make any proposals with their existing plant without interfering with other orders.If 18-pr. were sacrificed by the Ministry the same number of 12-pr. could be substituted. Our arrangements for 18-pr. (to replace casualties) are an average of forty-six new guns per month in 1917, but it seems to me to be quite impossible to sacrifice any of these without interfering seriously with keeping up the establishment of these guns in the fieid.Assistance might he given later by additions to plant. I have a proposal from Armstrongs to build 30-12-pr. per month at a cost of 150,000/. approximately, and from Beardmore to make 12 extra 12-pr. per month at an approximate cost of 24,000Z. It would not be safe to expect these extensions to be completed before the expiration of nine and seven months respectively.I have no similar proposals from Vickers and Coventry, but probably both could help to some extent by putting down extra plant. [1246]
I propose to reserve Woolwich for 18-pr. repairs, and they are preparing proposals for additional repair plant to cope with 250 18-pr. per month, in addition to their existing rate of 40 per month. ___-It will be noticed that if the promises of Coventry, Vickers, and Beardmore are realised the Admiralty will get 550 12-pr. in 1917, as against an addition of 425 asked for in their table of requirements given to us on Friday.I suggest, for your approval, that no sanction can be given to substitution of 12-pr. for new 18-pr. guns, and that, if further 12-pr. are required, as no doubt is the case, the extensions referred to (subject to careful examination of details and cost) be approved in the case of Armstrong and Beardmore, and that further enquiries be made as to similar proposals from Tickers and Coventry.The Armstrong and Beardmore proposals were received by me subsequent to the meeting, and they have not therefore been mentioned to Admiral Morgan Singer.These proposals are, of course, conditional on adequate additional supplies of necessary labour being available, both for construction and for operation. It is necessary to emphasise this condition, in view of the large and growing shortage of constructional labour, and of the large unsatisfied demand already existing for skilled labour, in which gun manufacture and repairs are very expensive.With regard to other methods of meeting Admiralty requirements I submit the following observations: t4:&apos;7-inch Guns.The supply of 60-pr. is increasing, and the Army Council may be willing to substitute this type for the 4*7-inch guns now in France. These latter guns are rapidly wearing out under the heavy firing at the front; 50 per cent, of them now being returned for repair require new &quot;A&quot; tubes.The operation of fitting a new &quot; A &quot; tube is a lengthy one, and it is not thought sound policy to attempt to carry out this nature .of repair, in view of repairs to other natures of guns which are considered more important.Some of these 4&apos;7-inch guns are mounted on cradles, having a short recoil, and probably the Admiralty have a certain number of mountings available for these. It would be comparatively easy to manufacture suitable naval mountings to take these guns and cradles without delaying output of Land Service guns.These guns would not be called on to fire such a great amount of ammunition, and their remaining life would probably be quite sufficient to meet all requirements.It is believed that there are at present about 130 available in the field and in reserve, but it would be necessary to withdraw these at once before they were worn out. A further twenty or thirty are available for repair with short bore and chamber liners ; this work would, however, interfere somewhat seriously with repairs to 6-inch Mark VII, and 60-pr. guns for the Army.15-pr. Q.-F. and B.L.C.I understand that the Admiralty have made 150 mountings suitable for these guns, but they have only received 100 guns from the Army for their mountings. They would like an additional fifty guns. These guns have proved useful, and one submarine is believed to have been sunk by them.6-inch 35-calibre.I understand that the Admiralty would like at least 100 of these, with their cradles and recuperators, as they can easily be adapted to a suitable naval mounting.In the Ministry&apos;s letter to the War Office, D.M.R.S.-404 of the 18th October, 1916, it was stated that it was anticipated that, in addition to the undermentioned orders for 6-inch guns, i.e. : 60--6-inch, Mark VII guns; 180-6-inch (35-calibre) equipments; 30 6-inch (35-calibre) guns ;a further 50-6-inch, Mark VII guns ;220 6-inch (35-calibre) equipments ;50 6-inch (35-calibre) guns ;might be obtained during 1917.
The War Office, in their letter 57/3/5111 (A.2) of the 2nd November, 1916, now* ask for the whole of these. This leaves no capacity for this type available for the Admiralty.It might be considered whether the total War Office requirements for 6-inch (35-calibre) could be reduced to 300 equipments, . 80 spare guns,thus leaving a capacity of 100 equipments for the Navy. If this was agreed to the division of these equipments between the two services should be settled at once. .- Guns in Neutral Countries.:At the beginning of the war there were a considerable number of British-made guns of 4-7.:inch calibre and thereabouts In neutral South American countries. These have been offered on various occasions through different channels, but not. to the Ministry, with the exception of a few old type field-guns.   :; :;-,-.v .It might now be possible to obtain some of these/. The prices asked in the past have been high, but this can only be considered as insurance to shipping.4i-mch Spanish Guns.The question of the twenty 4-inch. Spanish guns has already been brought to the notice of the Admiralty, and Vickers are . reporting on the time required for completion/,     - .&apos;,        .. -&quot;/.--, -. .&apos;- :v -&apos; ^      -;; h    &apos;&apos;:  . -&apos; --&quot;&apos;-&apos;&apos; -: 6-incK Chilian&apos; Guns.&quot;&quot;;   -;&apos;.-.&apos;     ::&quot;&apos;&quot;.&apos;The twenty-four 6-inch Chilian guns have also been brought, to the notice of the Admiralty, but I understand that, the .use? of these. is also being considered by the War Office for coast defences. * . ,   :-vCHARLES E.
