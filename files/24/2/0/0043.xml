Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1916.SECRET. G.-89,THE  ECONOMIC POSITION  IN  THE  CENTRAL  EMPIRES. Memorandum by Me. W. G. Max Muleer.IT is practically impossible for hie To add anything in the way of a survey 6f the economic conditions in the Central Empires&apos;to what I have &quot;said month by month in iny reports on the subject since &quot;the beginning of the war, and I therefore annex in a convenient form the prefaces to the German and Austro-Hungarian chapters of my report for September. These, together with the prefaces in my July and August reports-viz., for the last month of&apos;the second year of the war and the first two months of the third year contain all that I can find to say on the present economic situation in those countries ; and if I were to attempt to make a more definite and categorical statement on the subject it might easily become misleading.My necessarily limited knowledge of what is going on in the enemy countries is almost entirely a matter of inference and of impression, acquired by a careful study of scraps of information drawn from the most varied sources, such as the enemy and neutral presses, official speeches and announcements, debates in Parliament, legislative measures, descriptions of neutral visitors, reports of secret agents, and letters found on German soldiers in the field or intercepted in the post. None of these sources ;df information are absolutely reliable. We know that the enemy have on occasion made use of their own and neutral newspapers to mislead both native and foreign opinion. Stories told by neutrals aud reports of secret agents are often influenced by a desire to please ; and as to the extracts from captured and intercepted letters compiled in the War Office, I am afraid that those extracts are selected from thousands of letters With the express purpose of showing the worst&apos;side of things. Most of the.writers also appear to belong to a class without any influence, and, moreover, there are grumblers in all countries; and from my knowledge of the tone of the letters written by English people and examined in the censorship, I am not at alb sure that we could not compile a selection of extracts which would convey a very black picture of conditions in England.On the other hand, since the war began we have had no reliable German or Aiistro-Hungarian trade statistics to help us in forming our opinion, and certainly, to judge from our experience last year; it looks as if the official harvest bulletins were deliberately misleading. There are other important factors, for our knowledge of which we are dependent on. conjecture rather than;on fact. Eor instance, we are in ignorance as to the reserves of food and raw materials with which Germany entered on ;the%ar, and the exact amounts imported during the first year Of the war Or obtained from neighbouring countries, openly or clandestinely, up to the present day. We cair Only guess as to the food and raw materials taken from the occupied territories :and the weight of metal copper, tin, &amp;c. seized in the shape of finished &quot;articles. Again, in view of the habitual Overfeeding dfthe Germans, we cannot well decide how &quot;much their former standard of living can !be reduced without endangering the health of the population as a whole, nor do we know the exact&apos; amount of food required by the embodiment of a large proportion of the male population in the army. Finally, prices, in regard to which we have accurate statistical information, cannot, as I have ^repeatedly i stated in my reports, be taken as affording a reliable index to the. state of supplies, as the goods to&apos;which they apply are in most cases no longer sold in the free market or, where the price is not fixed, are purchasable only in strictly limited quantities. I may, however, mention that, according to the &quot;tables prepared by the Statistical Department of the Board of Trade, the cost of living, i.e., of food, in August 1916, as compared with July 191&apos;4, showed a rise of 116 per eferit. &quot;in Berlin and 178 per cent, in Vienna.My object in - referring to these considerations is to show why 1 am unable to furnish a more precise statement in regard to the present economic situation in -Germany and Austria-Hungary than is to:be found &quot;in &apos;iny last &quot;three &apos;mohthly reports. I will, however, endeavour &quot;to sum up mv ;imp&quot;ressiOns in-general terms.&quot; [1225] ^ B
In regard to finance, my impression is that hitherto the German Government hav experienced little, if any, difficulty in raising the money required to carry on the war How far the methods employed may be sound, and from what sources the interest on the vast borrowings is to be covered, are questions which do not immediately concern us. The fact remains, that the German Government have just succeeded in raising a fifth loan at 5 per cent., amounting to well over 500,000,0001, and I cannot help feeling that they will be able to repeat this operation at intervals of six months so long as the people retain their confidence in the ultimate victory of German arms.In the world of industry and commerce a complete revolution has taken place. A perfect network of control schemes covers almost all important raw materials and finished goods. The sale and utilisation of the former, except for military purposes, is confined within the narrowest limits, and trade interests and the requirements of the civilian population are very properly subordinated to the one all-important object of providing the army and navy with all that they require for carrying on the war. Factories engaged on the execution of orders for the Government and the war industries generally, such as mining, metal work, engineering, &amp;c, are therefore enjoying an unprecedented degree of activity, while factories that have not been able to adapt themselves to the output of war requisites of some kind or another are suffering severely. Among the industries that have been hardest hit are the shipping, textile, and building industries.By restricting the use of raw materials and employing substitutes wherever possible I do not believe that these substitutes, though certainly useful in some cases, have been so entirely successful as the Germans would have us believe; else why do they pay such huge prices for the real articles ? the German Government have managed to keep the various industries going, and rendered possible hitherto the manufacture in sufficient quantities of everything required for carrying on the war effectively.In regard to the actual stocks of raw materials in the country we have no reliable means of judging, and it would be imprudent, therefore, to venture a guess as to how long these stocks will last. The stocks of copper, tin and nickel have been replenished by the wholesale confiscation of goods containing those metals, and I believe that I am right in stating that there is no evidence of any real shortage of those metals so far as essential military requirements are concerned. The same remark applies to rubbe-i and leather.In regard to the supply of mineral oils motor spirit, lamp oil, and lubricants  there are clear signs of a severe stringency, but this will be almost entirely relieved if the Germans gain access to the oilfields and oil depdts of Boumania. Other industrial oils and fats are exceedingly difficult to procure, as all fats that can possibly be converted into human food must be used exclusively for that purpose, and -my impression is that it is on the supply of industrial oils and fats that our blockade is exerting the greatest effect.Where, however, the pinch has made itself most severely felt up till now is in the textile industry. It is safe to say that the stocks of cotton, wool, and other textile raw materials, and of goods both half-finished and finished, made therefrom, have fallen very low, and considerable inconvenience is likely to be experienced in the near future in providing clothing for the army and the civilian population.Generally speaking, however, I do not believe that up to the present time the lack of any raw material in the enemy countries has reached such a point as to seriously hamper the High Military Command in carrying on the military operations in the best possible manner, and we have no means at our disposal of judging whether this point is&apos; likely to, be reached within the next twelve months.it is when we come to study the question of the food supplies of the Central Empires that we find th$ clearest evidence of the injury that the blockade is inflicting on the enemy, though here, too, there is no reason to believe that the undoubted shortage has been allowed to affect the feeding of the soldiers in the field, at all events to such an extent as to impair their fighting powers.The present moment is a particularly unfortunate one to choose for a survey of the economic situation in the enemy countries so far as the supplies of the necessaries of life are concerned. All our conclusions are liable to be upset if the present attack on Boumania is crowned with success, and it is not too much to say that, apart from all military and political considerations, and solely from the point of view of the provisioning of the Central Empires, and also of Bulgaria and Turkey, with bread-corn, fodder, and animal products, anything like a permanent occupation of Boumania will prove a real disaster, and is likely to put back the effect of our blockade by at least a year, even if it
does not defeat it altogether. At the moment of writing it is not possible to say how far these fears are likely to be realised, but when one considers that Roumania habitually exports large quantities of wheat, barley, and maize, and that at the present moment she has stored up within her frontiers the whole of this years harvest and a considerable proportion of the surplus from the harvests of 1914 and 1915, it is easy to understand what an enormous difference it will make to the enemy countries if they are able to seize these huge stores of grain. In addition to grain, Roumania has extensive flocks of sheep and also considerable numbers of cattle and pigs.Previous to this last development of the war, there were good grounds for saying that we were making steady progress towards the economic strangulation of the Central Empires, though I do not believe that we have as yet reached the stage where the shortage of food can be said to detract in any way from the military efficiency of the German army, except, perhaps, in so far as the discontent resulting from the severe privations to which certain classes of the population are subjected, may be considered as weakening the moral of the nation as a whole, and therefore indirectly of the soldiers.During the first year of the war the so-called blockade had very little effect, and it was not till shortly after the gathering in of the poor harvest of 1915 that the German Government and the German people began to display real anxiety as to the food supply question, though certain restrictions on consumption had already been introduced from motives of prudence. Since then, however, conditions have steadily deteriorated.The numerous attempts of the various Governments to deal with the food problem by way of increased production, prevention of waste, and compulsory distribution on an equitable basis, have failed to produce any real lasting effect, for the simple reason that the ultimate cause of failure is to be found in the fact that supply is no longer equal to demand. There have, however, been several subsidiary causes, such as lack of decision and procrastination on the part of the authorities,- speculation and profiteering on the part of producers and merchants, selfishness on the part of the wealthy who were in a position to lay in large supplies, and, finally, the conflicting interests of Empire and State, town and country, producer and consumer. Production has been hampered by scarcity of skilled labour and lack of manure and fodder, and rapid distribution to the centres 6f consumption by the congestion of the means of communication. These factors appear .to me to render it quite impossible that the German Government should ever succeed fully in their Herculean task of putting a huge Empire on rations. In Austria and Hungary, where the Government interference has assumed a milder form, the absence of discipline among the people and the inferior efficiency of the administrative machinery have conduced towards a still more disastrous failure of the attempts made to secure an equitable distribution of the available foodstuffs.&apos;The prices of food, in spite of the successive efforts of the Governments to control them, still continue to rise, while rations, though fixed from time to time, seem on the whole to be steadily decreasing. What would have been thought short rations last January is now considered plenty.I shall not attempt to discuss here the relative shorage of the different articles of food, such as bread, flour, potatoes, meat, milk, and fats, as that is done at length in my monthly reports. The important thing for us to know is, not so much that bread is short at one time, potatoes at another, and meat and fat at another, but that there is clear proof that the sum-total of foodstuffs available for feeding the population is steadily diminishing. On that point anyone who reads the evidence summarised in the prefaces to my reports can have no doubt.In regard to the yield of the harvest this year, both in the enemy countries and m the occupied territories, we are very much in the dark; but we shall probably not be far from the mark if we say that the grain harvest of this year is a little better than the bad harvest of 1915, but that the important potato harvest is appreciably worse. On the other hand, the harvest year of 1915-16 was entered on with a considerable reserve from the previous year&apos;s crops. This is not the case this year, and the stocks of bread grain, fodder, and potatoes were practically exhausted before the new season&apos;s supplies became available. The home production of animal food, i.e., meat, milk, butter, and fat, should also be less this coming year than last. Besides, there is every reason to anticipate that the arrangements concluded with neutral countries bordering on Germany will result in sensibly reducing the imports of food into the Central Empires, and up till a few years ago we counted on their having to do without the large supplies drawn from Roumania during the past year.   As to this latter factor,
we are unfortunately now in doubt, to say the least of it, and I think it right to repeat that if the Central Empires succeed in obtaining from Roumania the entire stocks of grain and meat that must be in the country, this would, so far as I am in a position to judge, go far towards invalidating all the conclusions I have arrived at in regard to the shortage of food in Germany, and especially the statement, in my August report, that &quot; we may look forward with certainty to an even intenser food crisis next spring than we have witnessed during the past few months.&quot;Hitherto there is no evidence that the strain is approximating to breaking point, or that the stage of economic exhaustion is within sight.   Even in regard to the actual effect of the scarcity of food on the health of the people and therefore on their resisting power, the evidence is very conflicting, and any more categorical statement . those contained in my reports might easily be misleading.Millions in the enemy countries are already suffering hunger that may be taken as certain and will probably continue to do so even if the large stores of food in Roumania become available for feeding them; but to suffer hunger is not to die of hunger; and it is not possible, with the information at our disposal, to foresee that the position in this respect is likely to become intolerable within measurable distance of time, if ever.To sum up : my own impression, which I give for what it is worth, is that economic pressure alone will not prove the decisive factor in determining the duration of the war, and I do not consider that the Allies will be justified in relying on economic causes, unaccompanied by military reverses, to produce any sensible weakening, let alone a collapse, of the resisting powers of the enemy. In order to achieve the latter result it would be necessary to reduce the entire population of the Central Empires to the stage of starvation which forces the surrender of the inhabitants of a besieged city, and this 1 do not believe to be possible.This, however, is by no means equivalent to saying that the blockade is useless  far from it. The blockade may be described as a recognised form of military pressure brought to bear on the spirit of endurance of the entire civilian population, very different from the barbarous methods of &quot; frightfulness &quot; employed by the enemy for the same purpose. (It produces privation and even suffering, and thus breeds disaffection with the Government and loathing of the state of things responsible for the suffering, and therefore increases the longing for peace. So long, however, as the people think they are winning, they will put up with jDrivation ; but if once they lose their confidence in victory, privation will accelerate the end. Privation and distress alone cannot compel peace, but, by seriously undermining the resisting power of the nation, they will facilitate the acceptance of military defeat and submission to the victor&apos;s terms.&apos;W. G. M. M.October 26, 1916.
127ANNEX.Part I. Germany.The Economic Situation in Germany during September 1916, being theTwenty-sixth Month oe the War.&quot; AUSHALTEN, haushalten, maulhalten &quot;-endurance, economy, and silence-this is the motto on which the German nation is now trying to model its life. The early belief in a speedy and sweeping victory has gone for ever, and in its place we find a growing consciousness of impending danger and of the need of determined resistance to the onslaughts of the enemy. &quot;Those who have an opportunity of judging Germany from the inside are struck by the change that has come over the spirit of the nation ; confidence has given way to depression, and there are clear signs of discouragement and enervation both among the population and in the army. Nobody, of course, says : &quot; We are beaten&quot; ; in fact, defeat is still unthinkable to the German mind, and Germany&apos;s powers of resistance are far from being overcome, but the possibility of a stalemate is accepted by many, and this conviction, coupled with severe economic privation, is no doubt accountable for the reiterated demands for the opening of peace negotiations.Internal dissensions have long since undermined the spirit of unity which marked the initial stages of the war, and, though for the moment the Chancellor appears to have scored a success against his domestic enemies both in the Reichstag and in the country, there is every sign that the campaign against him is to be waged with undiminished violence, and his position may at any moment become critical. Similarly the attacks on Herr von Batocki show no sign of diminishing; on&apos; the contrary, they are more general and vehement than ever, and he is abused indiscriminately by Junkers and Socialists alike for failing to achieve his impossible task.^ Meanwhile the Government resort to every device to sustain the failing confidence of the nation and to strengthen its determination to hold out indefinitely against either military or economic disaster. The success of our offensive in the West is systematically belittled, and our losses in men and material are exaggerated; in faet, military events are deliberately falsified in the German bulletins-a most hopeful sign. On the other hand, any success of Germany or her Allies is magnified into a victory, and is made the occasion for a renewed outburst of bell ringing and flag waving, while at the same time the people are assured that, thanks to the good average harvest, food requirements for the coming year are fully secured and the infamous designs of England definitely frustrated. *We know, however, enough of what is going on in Germany to be able to state with certainty that, in spite of the utmost efforts of the German Government to hide the truth, the people are gradually coming to realise that the most they can now mope to achieve is to &quot; durchhalten,&quot; i.e., to hold what they have taken, and they begin to [1225] &quot; C
wonder whether such a result is worth the countless further sacrifices, both in the field and at home, which another year of fighting must entail; but from any idea of peace on our terms the German nation as a whole is as far removed as ever.During the past month a considerable volume of outside information in regard to the economic situation and the spirit of the people in Germany has reached us from the most varied sources, and it all tends to confirm the conclusions arrived at in former reports as to the growing hardships of life and the consequent spread of disaffection, though, as I have often said before, the disaffection is for the most part confined to the classes which have least to say in the direction of the affairs of the Empire.So far as Germans leaving the country are concerned the mot oVordre seems to be &quot; maulhalten,&quot; and they are evidently enjoined not to complain about the condition of things in the Fatherland, but to say that, though things are very dear, everything is obtainable. Still even the Germans themselves, as we have seen in former reports, occasionally let the cat out of the bag. A member of the Prussian Upper House, who was recently in Berne, spoke privately in the gloomiest terms regarding the economic conditions in Germany, and gave it as his opinion that the food question would become almost unendurable in February or March next year, largely owing to the poor potato harvest, which showed a shortage of 35 per cent.In their letters, however, the Germans generally are far more communicative, and, as I have often said before, it is really astonishing how far they let themselves go in their lamentations in spite of their fear of the censor. This is more particularly the case in the letters addressed to soldiers at the front. The complaints in these letters may often be overdrawn, and it would not be right to draw too general conclusions from particular instances of suffering, but the following passages obliterated by the German censor in correspondence taken from German prisoners of war appear to me to be peculiarly suggestive,: -Leipzig, August 18. &quot;You say that one of my letters was very much mutilated. It is because it contained too much truth. But people no longer believe in the lies that appear in,the papers. If you can obtain any information from the enemy you may believe it as he is better informed than we are ourselves. They make us swallow wordsi of comfort so that the stranger shall not know of our famine.&quot;August 27, &quot; If. these difficult, times continue much longer I shall see few, if any, birthdays again. It is only capitalists and the rich who are able to live in comfort.. It is., true that we have always been accustomed to privations, but at present, those of us who are poor suffer from hunger.&quot;Innumerable intercepted letters addressed to prisoners of war in this country or to persons resident in neutral countries tell much the same tale, as can be seen from the following passages : Hamburg. &quot; Meat is out of the question. Occasionally I get some fish for the children at a very high price. If. I were to tell you everything you would never believe me. . . . I have not tasted potatoes for a fortnight. The state of things is almost desperate as regards the children. One can no longer procure suitable food for them. My heart aches sometimes when I see the two girls going off to school as often as not on dry bread, or on bread spread with a beastly artificial honey.&quot;Berlin, August 5. &quot; A life of starvation.   There is nothing to be had for money. .... . . In the Dark Ages life could not have been more awful than atpresent.&quot;&quot;The soldiers who come on leave say that out at the front there is not much to eat, but that at home it is still worse, while the exchanged prisoners take a look round and wish they were all back again in prison.&quot;Hamburg, August 27.-&quot; Here at Hamburg we have had a great uprising because there was nothing to be had. Neither meat, potatoes, nor bread, and everything is so expensive.   At Hammersbooch there was a great row, any amountof windows broken, and the police charged the crowd with drawn swords.....At Barnbeck things are just as bad, the hussars &quot;charged the crowd with their swords ; at Messberg also they charged the peasants.&quot;The list of similar quotations could, be almost indefinitely prolonged, but the above will suffice to show that there has been no amelioration in their tone during the past
month or so. I must repeat, however; what I have said in former reports, that it would be imprudent to accept these letters1 &apos;als representing the real state of affairs in Germany, except in so far as they furnish corroboration of what we learn from other perhaps more reliable sources.I have frequently referred to the many, privations to which foreign diplomatists and consular officials are subjected in Germany. The American consul-general at Hamburg recently stated in the course of a conversation that the sufferings of the poor in that town were beyond description, and that he himself could not have gone on livinc in Hamburg without a long leave to enable him to get a good feed, and that as to his family he had sent them away long ago.Members of the Roumanian Legation in Berlin have declared that the Germans, rich and poor alike, are suffering from malnutrition, though they are still in a position to hold out for a long time, partly owing to the monopoly of the entire food supply by the Government, and partly owing to the imports from neighbouring countries.A Dutch army officer, who had recently been travelling in Germany on Govern-ment business, stated on his return that he had been much impressed by the change which had come over the people of Germany during the last twelvemonths; their outlook upon the war had completely changed, and their main thought and subject of conversation was food, or the lack of it.A Swiss doctor who visited Germany in order to study the food organisation, has convinced himself that the organisation is in some particulars clumsy, and in many more inoperative, and, in the preface to his report on the results of his investigations, he sums up his views in these words : &quot; I cannot imagine that the state of things which I have seen at Berlin can be allowed to grow worse without the gravest consequences supervening.   Already&apos; the food supply generally is absolutely insufficient, and, in particular, the rations of fat and of albumen are cut down to the lowest possible limit.&quot;A Swiss professional man, who has recently spent ten days in Germany visiting Munich, Berlin, Hanover, and certain industrial towns of Westphalia, told a member of our Legation in Berne that during the entire journey he never tasted meat as it was too expensive. In the Westphalian industrial districts he heard that the workmen were complaining of underfeeding which incapacitated them from heavy work, and he expressed the opinion that this was bound in time to have an injurious effect on the production of munitions and war materials of all kinds.A Dutchman who has been living in Germany since the beginning of the war and has only just returned to Holland, declared in an interview with the correspondent of the &quot; Volk &quot; newspaper that the German assertion that there was no famine in Germany was palpably false. The position, he maintained, was simply terrible, and he had left Germany because he could bear it no longer.Several other well-authenticated instances of neutrals having thrown up good positions in Germany owing to the difficulty of obtaining proper nourishment have been reported during the past month, including (1) a Dane who had been employed at the Danish consulate at Stuttgart; (2) a young Swiss bank clerk in the employ of the Deutsche Bank, with a monthly salary of 320 M. ; and (3) a Swiss mechanic employed at one of the large munition works at a monthly salary of 450 *M. News has also been received of the passage through Zurich of many Spanish workmen from Germany, who declared that, though they were fully satisfied with their wages, they were not able to live on them.An informant, who has interviewed several Dutch people lately returned from Germany, reports that their experience has been that many articles of food were no longer to be got at all, and that the civilian, population was enduring considerable hardship in consequence.Perhaps the most convincing testimony which has reached us lately in regard toGermany&apos;s economic straits is that supplied by M. Popoff, Bulgarian Director-Generalof Statistics, in a conversation which he had&apos; with a neutral on the 9th September.M. 1 op oft, as an ally of Germany, is not likely to have exaggerated the gravity ofher condition; nevertheless, he is reported to have expressed himself in the following terms :-n eu est pas de meme en ce qui concerne la situation economique : de ce cote la science est impuissante. Isolee du monde, 1&apos;Allemagne apercoit&apos; le spectre dune angoissante situation economique qui precipitera sa defaite. La vie est nors de prixtout fait deTaut.   Si on re&quot;capitule les produits alimentaires que
l&apos;Allemagne peut tirer de son sol et de celui de ses allies, et si on fait le calcul de ceux qui sont necessaires a sa consommation, on trouve un vide impossible a com bier.&quot; Aujourdliui c&apos;est le beurre, la viancle, les ceufs et le lait qui sont rares : le jour n&apos;est pas loin oil le pain fefa aussi defaut. Bien des choses de premiere ndcessite disparaitront et la debacle economique sera complete.&quot;I have often warned my readers against drawing too optimistic conclusions from these tales of neutral travellers. It would be a grave mistake to accept every word contained in them as gospel truth, but on the other hand it would be foolish to reject entirely the cumulative evidence which they afford of the grave economic situation occasioned in Germany by the state of war in general and the pressure of the Allied fleets in particular.Among the accounts of neutral observers none have interested-me more than the record of his experiences and impressions of life in Germany published by Mr. Curtin in the &quot;Times.&quot;Mr. Curtin&apos;s evident desire to convey a truthful picture of what he saw, rather than to write what would please the English public, inspires confidence in his judgment, and I am gratified to see that, so far as the food question is concerned, he arrives at very much the same conclusions to which my studies have led me. I entirely agree with him that the state of affairs in Germany has been grossly exaggerated by portions of the Allied press, and that stories of starvation should be rejected; but his conclusion that &quot; the whole of Germany and Austria-Hungary are in a condition that is not yet serious, but is already extremely uncomfortable,&quot; sounds almost unduly conservative, though perhaps it may be interpreted as conveying in other words what I have sought to express in earlier reports by the phrase &quot;privation but not starvation.&quot;I am also glad to see that the reports on the food situation in Germany issued by the French General Staff, and based almost exclusively on intercepted letters, agree in the main with mine, though their conclusions as to the effect of our economic pressure are rather more definite and optimistic.The information contained in the present report proves more or less conclusively that the cereal harvest has fallen short of the exaggerated hopes entertained a few weeks ago ; that the all-important potato crop is likely to prove a failure; and that the lack of fodder will be more severely felt even than last year, which in turn will react on the supplies of meat, milk, and fat.During September the facts in regard to the harvest have tended to assume more definite shape, and it now appears that, even taking the most favourable view, the German crop in the ground might at one time have been capable of yielding 25 per cent, more of wheat and rye than in the admittedly disastrous year 1915, but that this hoped-for increase has been very appreciably reduced by the unfavourable weather that prevailed in many districts of Germany during the,whole period of harvesting, so that at the best the additional yield of bread-grain is barely sufficient to counterbalance the deficiency created by the exhaustion of reserves and the absence this year of any imports from lloumania. For barley and oats, also, the results are evidently less good than was expected. There would, however, appear to be enough corn to permit a limited increase in rations and a reduction in certain cases of prices. The temporary extra allowance to persons engaged in severe manual labour is to be made permanent, and, in addition, a supplementary allowance is to be granted to young persons between the age of 12 and 17, but, in my opinion, the reason for these measures is to be found rather in the increased stringency in the supplies of other essential foodstuffs, especially of potatoes, than in the abundance of the harvest of wheat and rye.If the potato crop should really prove as bad as the various reports which reach us-appear to indicate, the result would be a disaster for the German nation. Even in normal years, potatoes form the staple food of millions of Germans, and this is more than ever the case under war conditions. Moreover, in normal years Germany employs 40-60 per cent, of her potato crop as fodder for her farm animals. . If the potato harvest turns out a failure, the authorities will be more or less forced to reserve the whole crop for feeding the population in one form or another, and the shortage of fodder, which is already the most serious difficulty confronting agricultural production, will, indeed, become critical. Cattle breeding will have to be decreased to a still greater extent, fewer pigs will be fed, and the shortage of meat, fat, milk, and butter will become even more acute. It is small wonder that the Government, and indeed the whole nation, are displaying such extreme anxiety about the potato harvest; anything like a total failure would bring the German nation appreciably nearer to starvation.
The shortage of other forms of fodder, due to the interruption of the usual enormous imports from abroad and toother causes enumerated in the body of the report,, may be accepted as an established. fact. It is very significant that, in spite of the general appeal for an increase in pig-keeping, the authorities should have found it necessary to issue a warning that, as there is still so much difficulty in obtaining fodder, no person should embark on keeping pigs until he has made sure Of a necessary supply of foodstuff.The Government are indeed on the horns of a dilemma: On the one hand they cannot provide more fodder without depriving the people of bread, potatoes/sugar, &amp;c. ; on the other, without more fodder there can be no increase in the number of cattle and pigs. The present report contains abundant evidence of how serious the problem facing the Government already is. The supply of meat, especially of pork, is even now barely sufficient to supply the meagre ration of lb. a week. The breeding of cattle, the1 keeping of milch cows and the fattening of pigs, already difficult, would become almost impossible with less fodder. For a short time meat might reach the market in larger quantities, but fewer cows mean less milk and fewer pigs less fat, and by next spring the lack of meat, milk, and fat would be ten times worse than it is at present, even if it had not yet reached the point of starvation. As it is with ^ lb. or even less of meat, a week, 90 grammes of fat and butter in some cases even this meagre ration is not attainable one or two eggs and with unskimmed milk practically reserved for children under 6 and invalids, the nourishment of the average German in animal foodstuffs is well below the standard considered necessary from the physiological point of view. When we add enforced abstinence from sweet dishes and curtailment of his habitual over-indulgence in beer, we can well understand his resentment against a state Of affairs which entails on him such unwonted privations.The success of the War Loan was only to be expected, though opinions may differ as to the soundness of the means by which this success was achieved, but the practical result, so far as the carrying on of the war is concerned, is to furnish the German Government with sufficient funds for that purpose during the next six months.The entry of Roumania into the war has very naturally added greatly to the already existing anxiety as to the supply of illuminating and lubricating oils. In the textile trade generally the stagnation becomes steadily more accentuated. I would call special attention to the impression which seems to prevail in German financial and shipping circles that German overseas trade for some time after the war will&apos; consist in imports rather than in exports, as the stocks of manufactured articles suitable for export are low and some time must elapse before they can be renewed.To sum up, there has been no startling development m the economic situation, either in one direction or the other, during the past month.   The sustained pressure of -the blockade and the numerous arrangements we have concluded with neutral countries are exercising a cumulative effect which is indignantly, though reluctantly, admitted by the Germans themselves.&apos; Certain loopholes still exist, especially in Holland, though here, too, the amount of food sent to Germany shows signs of diminution. It is satisfactory to read that the harvest in Holland has been in general disappointing, and that there are fears in that country of a coming food shortage, as this wili probably do more towards curtailing the exportation of foodstuffs to Germany than any arrangement we might come to with the Dutch Government. *1 must repeat, however, that hitherto there is no sign that the German nation is seriously hampered in its conduct of the war by the scarcity of any commodity. Discomfort and even privation exists, and may in time lead to a dangerous state of feeling among the people and thus accelerate the consummation of our task. The Germans are not starving and it is very doubtful whether they ever will be, however closely the blockade may be tightened. Last month I ventured to express the opinion that a peace extorted by famine alone would not be the peace we aim at. Since then I uVe recerved a letter from a high official directly engaged in the work of tightening. the blockade, who writes: If 1 thought the blockade would be the decisive weapon in the war, I should personally be reluctant to use it. I would rather feed them and beat them than starve them without beating them.&quot;Germany must be fought down and not starved into submission, even were such a ing possible, for by this means alone can we hope to secure:a peace which will give us   adequate reparation for the past and adequate security for the future.&quot;[1225] ---------- &quot; D
Part II.-Austria-Hungary.The Economic Situation in Austria-Hungary during September 1916.THE debates in the Hungarian Parliament during the past month bear witness to a rising spirit of discontent, though the attacks directed against the policy of the Govern-ment appear for the present to have spent themselves in mere invective. Count Tisza remains where he was, secure in the confidence of his Sovereign and in the unques-tioning support of a servile majority, and Baron Burian still rules at the Ballplatz in spite of all Count Andrassy&apos;s efforts to oust him from his position.Several sittings of the House were taken up with a discussion of the relations between Hungary, her partner in the Dual Monarchy, and her German ally. Various Opposition members&apos;attacked the domination exercised by the military command, in other words by the German General Staff, in Austro-Hungarian affairs, and even Count Andrassy declared that the monarchy had become a vassal State. Much indignation was aroused by a recital of various insults placed on Hungarian officers and soldiers by the German and Austrian military authorities, and the bravery of the Hungarian troops was contrasted with the alleged cowardice of the Austrians. Count Apponyi continued the attacks made on the Austrian military command, and directed his criticism mainly against the Archdukes who, he said, were pitchforked into the chief commands without possessing the necessary experience or qualifications, and thus became responsible for the many reverses that had befallen the Austro-Hungarian forces. In the mouth of a sober statesman of ministerial rank like Count Apponyi, such an indictment acquires additional significance.Count Karolyi is reported to have gone so far as to ask the Minister President whether the King of Hungary had abdicated his rights to the German Emperor.A discussion also took place in the Hungarian Parliament in regard to the possibility of a separate peace, but even the initiator of the discussion made it a condition of any pourparlers that Transylvania should first be cleared of invaders, thus confirming what I have so often said as to the determination of every Hungarian, without difference of party, to defend Transylvania to his last breath.It is curious to note throughout these discussions, side by side with the jealousy and fear of Austria and Germany expressed by the Independence party, indications of a lurking desire for&apos;a return to the old relations with France and Great Britain.There can indeed be no doubt that weariness of the war is widespread throughout Hungary, and that a return to peace conditions on almost any terms would be welcomed by large masses of the population; but Hungary is no longer an independent agent, either politically or militarily, and even if Count Tisza were not bound hand and foot to his German masters, no Hungarian Government would be able to take effective independent action in the direction of peace. Both iiustria and Hungary will have to submit to far greater humiliation and suffering before they can enjoy again the blessings of peace.In regard to the state of public opinion in Austria it is more difficult to form any opinion, as Parliament is not&apos;sitting and the censorship exercises strict control over the political utterances of the press, but there is little doubt that among the people there is a longing for peace. The indifference to the war which has frequently been com-mented on before, appears still to exist in many classes. According to a Swedish observer, no one in Austria takes the war seriously. The inhabitants, he adds, seem to realise that they have nothing to gain by victory and nothing to lose by defeat, so the population refuses to be disturbed, however badly things may go.It is, perhaps, not too much to say that anxiety concerning the food situation outweighs even the depression caused by the entry of Rou mania into the war and the invasion of Transylvania. The great question now is what fresh sufferings the winter will bring. In Hungary, we are told, people look forward to the winter with terror and ask each other how they will be able to support the privations which it is sure to bring. The Government appear at last to have woke up to the gravity of the situation, but their present activity comes too late, and there is little, if any, chance of effecting any real amelioration of the present deplorable conditions merely by introducing modifications in the system of distribution. The Hungarian Millers&apos; Association has declared that early next summer there will be no more flour at the rate at which it is now being consumed, even if the maize crop should turn out to be a success, which is by no means likely, while the shortage of meat and milk will grow worse rather than better.The general scarcity of food and other necessaries is aggravated by the continued
exportation of foodstuffs to Austria and Germany, and by the influx of swarms of refugees from Transylvania, all of whom have to be provided with food, even though that food may only consist of bread and vegetables.The popular resentment at the failure of the Government to take adequate and timely steps to ensure an equitable and economical use of the available food supplies has borne fruit both in Austria and Hungary in a series of new measures which are fully described in the chapter on food supplies. Certainly, hitherto, Government action has been lamentably unsuccessful, and, given a continuance of the present economic conditions, I see no reason to anticipate that it will be more successful in the coming year. It is indeed a bad augury for the future that the&apos; very first month of the harvest year should have been marked by occasional stoppages in the bread and potato supplies, and it is only natural that such occurrences should have aroused discontent and anxiety among the poorer classes. That the creation of special food departments, the multiplication of &quot;meatless and fatless days, and all the other Government measures will succeed in increasing the production of food or even in enforcing a really just distribution of such food as there is, I do not believe. The very multiplicity of the measures adopted by the two Governments is an acknowledg-ment of the gravity of the economic menace. To mention only a few of the measures adopted by the two Governments during the past month food departments have been created, an additional &quot;meatless day&quot; has been introduced in Austria, and two &quot; meatless days&quot; and one &quot; fatless day&quot; in Hungary, where fresh restrictions have also been imposed on bills of fare; the agricultural flour ration has been reduced in Hungary, and sterner measures of requisitioning grain adopted; the production of malt from barley has been forbidden, the output of beer still further reduced, and its consumption restricted; higher maximum prices have been fixed for potatoes; in Austria the entire trade in horned cattle and in milk has been brought under Government control; and finally the Austrian Government have adopted fat-tickets, and fixed a fat ration for the whole country of 120 grammes of fatty products a week, and are taking steps to ensure that every particle of edible fat produced in Austria should be devoted exclusively to feeding the population.That all these complicated measures will be effectively carried out, or that, even if they were, they would achieve their object, is more than doubtful, but it is quite certain that they will prove a heavy trial to the easy going Austrian or Hungarian.In regard to the all-important question of the harvest, all the available infor-mation is given in the body of the report. Such as it is, it points to the yield having fallen short of the expectations; in fact, Count Tisza practically admitted that the people had been misled by untrue estimates of the crops.Regarding the effect on the feeding of the population Count Tisza declared in the Chamber of Deputies that he could not conceal the fact that the situation was difficult, and that the quantity of grain at the disposal of the country was not sufficient to meet the normal consumption, though there was enough to save the population from want, as during the last two years the consumption of the people had been reduced/ He accepted the responsibility of providing that the shortage of foodstuffs did not interfere with the fighting capabilities of the monarchy.Such a statement in the mouth of the head of the, ,Government is hardly calculated to reassure the nation, which looks to him to keep starvation from the door.Besides the information derived from the newspapers, which is reproduced in the body of this report, we have this month obtained but few sidelights on conditions in Austria from outside sources.A friend of mine resident in Sweden has forwarded to me an extract from a letter from a wealthy Swede resident in Yienna, which runs as follows :&apos; &quot; We are perishing for want of real food.   I have not been able to obtain bread for a week, only vegetables.&quot;Another Swede, writing from Yienna, declares that the food question has not been so rationally treated as in Germany,- and gives instances of. the exorbitant prices that are charged. He says that for the simplest meat dish in a good restaurant in Vienna he had to pay 4 to 5 kronen; in the country he was often unable to get any meat at all in the inns, and had to be content with bread and potatoes, though on the whole he came to the conclusion that the peasants were prospering at the expense of the rest of the population.--------- -
An American lately resident in Vienna upon a Red Cross Mission states that rubber, copper, petrol, milk and fats are the scarcest and most needed articles, while the wife of an American doctor in charge of a big military hospital in Vienna writes that she is returning to America in order to be able to get proper food for her little son. She adds that &quot; there is a strong feeling of hatred against Germany,&quot; and expresses the opinion that &quot;there will be a revolution before the winter is over if the war last that long.&quot;The neutral press has published reports to the effect that food for the Austro-Hungarian troops is much scarcer than formerly and that the quality has much deteriorated, but it would be imprudent to accept such a statement without further corroboration.That the shortage of food is having a detrimental effect on the health of the nation is admitted. The vital statistics of Budapest show that for the period 15th January to the 1st September, 1916, the population suffered a net decline of 647, as compared with a net increase of 2,530 during the corresponding period of 1915. The Director of the Budapest Statistical Bureau attributes this decline on the one hand to the smaller number of babies born owing to the absence of so many men on active service, and on the other to the larger number of deaths and especially to increased infant mortality due to harder conditions of life and insufficient feeding among large sections of the community. The &quot; Pester Lloyd,&quot; in commenting on these statistics, remarks that &quot; the power of resisting disease has been weakened and the tendency to sickness heightened by war conditions, and the increase of infant mortality is due to lack of nourishment, especially milk, and to neglect arising from the increased employment of mothers away from the home.&quot;The &quot; Arbeiter Zeitung &quot; (13th September), in an article on &quot;War and the Health of the Workers,&quot; states that &quot; the number of cases of sickness among the working classes has increased markedly during the last few months. The workers are already used up and fall to pieces. Moreover, the number of deaths is relatively great. Both facts indicate a deterioration in the health of the working classes, and this will continue for the causes are already in operation.&quot;To the food troubles from which the nation is suffering is now added the burden of fresh taxation. In Hungary fresh taxes were voted in July, while in Austria they were imposed by Imperial Decree at the beginning of September, but the noticeable point in regard to the new Austrian taxes is that, even if they realise the very exaggerated estimates of their yield put forward officially, which appears to be quite out of the question, they will not suffice to cover the interest of the colossal war expenditure already incurred, and the Austrian Government will be faced at the end of the war with the alternatives of repudiation or squeezing still more revenue out of the pockets of a bankrupt nation.printed at the foreign office by C. r. harrison. 7/11/1916,
