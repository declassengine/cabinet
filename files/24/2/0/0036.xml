JBik&apos;lfaaiment-j8 fee Pmperiff of Bjs Britam^ MqesffB Go?emmeai]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   October 1916.SECRET. G-82.THE WAR COMMITTEE AND NAVAL 6-lNCH GUNS.(Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty.) [See Wrar Committee Paper W.C.-71, Conclusion 8.]TEE most embarrassing difficulty connected with the conduct of the war is due to the fact that of no single war requisite is there enough to go round. There is a shortage of everything. In these circumstances there must inevitably be some conflict of interests between the Departments and between the Allies, and in the last resort it falls to the War Committee to arbitrate between them.Many, perhaps most, of these cases can be settled, as it were, out of court, others neither can nor, in my opinion, ought to be so settled. It is of the latter I wish to speak in this memorandum; and I will draw from the recent experience of this Office an example of each of these contrasted types.The Italians came to the Admiralty not long since and made an earnest appeal for 6-inch shell. The Admiralty would of course have preferred keeping these shells for their own use, for it is quite possible to imagine a contingency in which the Navy would require them. But this contingency is somewhat unlikely and remote, while the Italian need was immediate and pressing. The Admiralty therefore thought them-selves justified, without consulting the War Committee, in parting with a certain amount of this ammunition, which, judging by the last reports from the Italian front, has proved to be exceedingly useful.The case is quite different when we turn to the 6-inch guns recently asked for by the Munitions Department on behalf of the army. There is no doubt that the need for these guns on the Somme is great. Unfortunately, the needs of the Admiralty are not less insistent. It is true that the cruiser out of which they are being taken is undergoing a long refit, and is in any event not one of our most valuable ships. If, therefore, we had no other use for the guns, we could surrender them without serious misgiving; but this unfortunately is not the case. At the present moment our chief naval weapon against Germany is the blockade; and Germany&apos;s chief weapon against us is the submarine. &quot;The surrender of these 6-inch guns weakens us under both heads. The guns with which the blockading merchant ships are armed, are guns of an older pattern, far outranged by the guns which were carried by the &quot;Moewe&quot; or would be carried by any other raider which attempted to break through our blockading cordon. It is a disquieting reflection that if the raider attacked our ships at long range, the latter as at present armed could make no effective reply.Again, if we put the long 6-inch guns into our merchant cruisers, the older6-inch guns which they displaced would be available for protecting merchant shipsengaged in commerce.   For these ships an increase in the number of our guns is mosturgently required, and will be more and more urgently required as the Germansubmarine menace becomes more formidable.   I find that from the 1st January, 1916,to the 7th September last, 122 British unarmed j/vessels were attacked by submarineson the surface.  Of these, 100 were sunk, while only 22 made good their escape.   Ifind, on the other hand, that of the 78 defensively armed vessels attacked bysubmarines on the surface, 71 made good their escape, and only 7 were eventually sunk.Now, in the face of these figures, it is impossible for the Admiralty to take upon themselves the responsibility of surrendering any of the guns which, directly or indirectly, could help to defend our merchant ships.   If the surrender is made, it [1148]
must be made on the sole authority of the War Committee. This Committee may decide, after comparing the undoubted needs of the Army and the not less undoubted needs of the Navy, that on the whole the needs of the Army are the most pressing. In so deciding they may be right. But the responsibility must be theirs, and in justice to the Admiralty the verdict must be formally recorded upon our minutes. This should, I venture to suggest, be the general practice governing all similar cases.A. J. B.Admiralty, October .10, 1916. *
