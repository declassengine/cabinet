38SECRET. Gh61.MEMORANDUM ON MERCANTILE SHIPPING.IN the enclosed Memorandum, prepared in the Secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence, certain statistics, many of which have appeared in one form or another in papers prepared either for the Cabinet or the War Committee, have beefi put in juxtaposition, in order to show the present position in regard to merchant shipping, and the various directions in which steps may be taken to improve the situation. ,Mi P; A. H.March 3, 19.16.1. The number of steamers of 100 tons gross and upwards on the registers of. the United Kingdom and thetAllies on the 30th June, 1914, and the 2nd February, 1916, according to figures furnished by the Board of Trade, was as follows : Table I.

The double process of wastage and replacement leading to this result may be further analysed, though it. is not possible to trace it with complete accuracy.[345]BPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.

To them should perhaps be added 79 British ships of 207.055 held up in the Baltic and j^Black Sea (1st July, 1915), making an aggregate loss of 601 ships and 1,716,095 gross tonnage.Replacement.3. Replacement may take three forms : (1) new construction ; (2) liberation of interned ships; (3) capture of prizes.(1.) Figures of ships of over 100 tons gross launched between the 30th June and the 31st December, 1914, are not available separately, but the totals for the two complete years 1914 and 1915 are thus given in Lloyd&apos;s Annual Summary of the World&apos;s Shipbuilding.Table III.

The figures provided by the Admiralty are shown in Table IV. The enemy ships in Portuguese ports were seized at a date later than the 2nd February, 1916, and therefore fall outside Table I. The remainder is a total of 408 ships of 1,181,327 gross tonnage. It is not possible to say precisely what portion of these were in use on the 2nd February, 1916.Table IV.

Table III shows ships launched, but a large number of thesevare without engines and have never been completed. From both Table III and Table IV deductions must also be made in respect of transfer and sale of ships to neutrals.4. Monthly, or even quarterly, statements of wastage and replacement have proved unobtainable. It may, however, be doubted whether they would be of great value. It may be assumed that they would show considerable fluctuations, due to shipbuilding, captures, &amp;c, on our part, or to submarine attack by the enemy, and there is no reason to suppose that these intermittent but opposed activities have synchronised so nearly as to neutralise one another over any but a considerable period. An illustration of the difficulty-of drawing inferences may be found in the following table taken from Lloyd&apos;s Register Shipbuilding Returns: 
Quarter.Steam.Number.Gross Tonuage.1914-June        .30	463	1,717,747September 30	470	1,718,730December 30       ..	453	1,625,1061915  March       30	465	1,585,967June        30	434	1,505,025September 30	429	1,535,507December 30	415	1,362,360From these figures it is not possible, without further information, to say to what extent the total for any quarter represents new ships, or ships which have appeared in previous quarters and still remain &quot; under construction.&quot; By themselves they furnish no indication of the rate at which new ships are being constructed.5. The figures shown in Tables I-IV, though important, have comparatively little bearing on the present value in use of our merchant shipping. Apart from requisitioned ships (now amounting to nearly 2,000, including small vessels, with a gross tonnage of about 7,000,000), there are other factors, e.g., congestion of ports, scarcity of dock labour, voyages made partly with ballast, direct voyages or round trips, which have a material effect on the actual carrying power under present conditions of the tonnage named. But setting aside the problem of the most economical use of our available shipping, there are certain points which deserve notice.6. It appears from Table I that if a net increase of tonnage be set against a net loss of ships up to the end of January 1916, the position, whether considered from the point of view of the United Kingdom or of the Allies as a whole, has been substantially maintained. This is partly attributable to the output of new ships, partly to the employment of prizes and of interned enemy ships. In estimating the future position it must be remembered that the vessels detained in Portuguese ports do not appear in Table I, and are therefore to be reckoned as an additional asset. Some ships may conceivably be made available from ports in other neutral countries, but otherwise this category must be looked on as an exhausted reservoir. On the other hand, losses from sinking and capture must be presumed to continue. It follows that for replacement or increase we must look mainly to the completion of ships already launched and to new construction.7. Summing up, it would seem that the following are the directions in which an improvement in the existing situation wtih regard to mercantile shipping must be sought: (a.) Improved methods of employing the available supply of shipping, such as the restriction of non-essential supplies and the relief of the congestion in ports. This aspect of the question is receiving close attention from the Board of Trade in concert with the various Departments and Committees engaged on different branches of this problem.(b.) Diplomatic steps to obtain the use of enemy ships which have sought refuge in neutral ports, as exemplified by the release of the German ships in Italian and Portuguese ports.(c.) An increase in the building of merchant ships, a matter which is the subject of close and concerted attention on the part of the Board of Trade, the Admiralty, and the Ministry of Munitions.8. A summary of recent conclusions of the War Committee bearing on the shortage of merchant shipping appears in the Appendix.Table Y.Merchant &quot;Vessels under Construction in the United Kingdom.
APPENDIX.War Committee Conclusions. Meeting held on December 13, 1915: The transport of The Admiralty to examine and report on the possibility oftroops and military utilising any surplus accommodation ou board liners (for example, stores to the East.    tjie Tjmon Castle and Bibby Liners) outward-bound to South Africaand the East, via the Suez Canal, for the conveyance of troops andmilitary stores to Egypt and the East.Meeting held on December 15, 1915 : Shipping Transport The Admiralty and War Office should at once consider infor the East. concert what arrangements can be made (a.) To transport additional forces to Salonica in case of greatemergency; and (6.) To hasten the transport of troops to Egypt.The Admiralty are authorised, if they consider it indispensable, to take up additional shipping now in the Home ports, but they should pay particular regard to the other important Allied interests affected by the withdrawal of shipping, and should bear in mind the special dependence of the South African and Far Eastern trade on liner traffic.The War Committee consider that, in view of the existing and prospective military situation in Mesopotamia, the transport of the remaining Indian Division from Marseilles to Mesopotamia should be regarded as a first claim on our shipping. The Admiralty, in consultation with the India Office, should do all in their power to hasten the despatch of this Division from France.Meeting held on February 11, 1916 : Arrears in Naval The Admiralty have reported to the War Committee that theand Mercantile^ programme of naval construction is in arrears ; and the Board of Ship Construction.    Trade report very serious delay in the completion of merchantships now building. In each case one of the principal causes of delay is shortage of labour, and more particularly of fitters and other skilled men. Having regard to the insufficiency of*mercantile tonnage which already exists, and to the probability of increased activity on the part of the enemy in submarine warfare in the near future, the War Committee are of opinion that the removal of the delay in the construction of naval and mercantile shipping is a matter, of the first importance to the proper prosecution of the war and the cause of the Allies. They recommend that a conference should take place as soon as possible between the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, and the Ministry of Munitions, to consider the allocation of the supplies of skilled labour and the best means of stimulating the process of diluting labour and of securing satisfactory time-keeping in the shipbuilding industry. This conference should be followed, if necessary, by a further conference between representatives of the Government, of the principal industries concerned, and of the labour interests affected.
The Admiralty would welcome a diversion of trade from eastern to western ports, but, in view of the pressure on the western ports of the United Kingdom, the Board of Trade do not consider this practicable on a large scale. The War Committee recommend that enquiries should be made as to the possibility of exceptionally valuable Cargoes, such as manganese ore, being diverted to western ports. Representatives of the Board of Trade should confer with Mr. Leonard W. Llewelyn, Director of Materials, Ministry of Munitions, on this subject.Meeting held on February 17, 1916: -Arrears in Ship The President of the Board of Trade reported to the WarConstruction. Committee the results of the meeting between the representatives ofthe Admiralty, the Board of Trade, and the Ministry of Munitions, in consequence of conclusion 1 of the War Committee meeting held on Friday, the 11th February, 1916 (War Committee Paper W.C. 24). He explained that it had been decided that Sir George Oroydon Marts should proceed forthwith to Newcastle to arrange with Messrs. Hawthorn, Leslie, and Co., Messrs. Palmers, and other firms in the Newcastle district for tire dilution of labour on the same lines as those already adopted at Messrs. Armstrong, Whitworth, and Co. The President, of the Board of Trade undertook to report progress to the War Committee in a fortnights time, and&apos; it was agreed that in the meantime the Government conference with representatives of labour, referred to in War Committee Paper W.C. 24, would not be required.Diversion of Shipping from the East to the West Coast.Meeting held on February 29, 1916 : The Shipment of 7. As an indispensable preliminary to the elaboration of aBussian Munitions,   comprehensive schemte for securing  the  transport  to  the  mostconvenient available ports in Russia of the more essential supplies ordered for Russia in the United Kingdom, America, and France, the following measures were approved :-(a.) Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee is taking steps to procure information as to the quantity of merchant shipping under the Russian flag and the degree to which it is open to requisition by the Russian Government.(6.) The Government should come to an early decision on the proposals discussed between Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee and the President of the Board of Trade for the further restriction of imports to the United Kingdom.(c.) Lord Curzons &quot;Committee will then be in a position to draw-up a scheme for the allocation of the available Allied shipping.(d.) The proposal to make an arrangement with the Russian Government for the control of shipping, either in the White Sea or at Vladivostok, can then be reviewed in the light of the information thus obtained.PBINTBD AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BT C.
