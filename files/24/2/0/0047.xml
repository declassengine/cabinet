SECRET. G.-93.MERCHANT SHIPPING.Memorandum by the Shipping Control Committee.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. G.-88.)Sir,I AM directed by Lord Curzon to state, for the information of the Prime Minister, tbat the Shipping Control Committee have had before them a memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade, dated the 24th October (O.I.D. Paper G.-88), on the subject of merchant shipping.The Committee are in complete agreement with the views expressed by Mr. Runciman.They regard the present and prospective tonnage situation as so serious that unless immediate steps are taken along the lines indicated in the memorandum, there is good reason to fear that the shortage of shipping, already severe, will become, if it has not indeed already become, a source of positive danger to the country.It is not proposed to go over the ground already covered by Mr. Runciman, but rather to submit, for the consideration of the War Committee, the following points which, to some ex tent, supplement and support his conclusions : 1. Acceleration of Merchant Shipbuilding.Prom the very beginning of their work in January last, the Committee have had this question constantly before them. ,On the 19th April a memorandum on the importance of constructing new vessels was circulated by Lord Curzon. to the Cabinet. As a result it was decided in May last that certain shipyards were to be allocated exclusively to the building of merchant vessels. But since then, owing to the shortage of (a) material and (o) labour, referred to by Mr. Runciman, work has not proceeded as well as was hoped. In this connection two suggestions are submitted: -(a.) Material. The Committee consider it very desirable that arrangements should be made as soon as possible to increase the production of the steel works for rolling plates in this country. They realise that an immediate difficulty will be raised in finding labour to enlarge the. plants, but they suggest that the men could be found by utilising for this purpose the labour that will probably become free when the munition and other works, such as those at Gretna Green, now nearing completion, are absolutely finished.(b.) Labour for Shipbuilding. During the summer a certain number, but unfor-tunately only a small number, of skilled men returned from the front to their old employment in the shipyards. The Committee understand that there are still men in Erance, trained in shipbuilding and engineering, and it is suggested, in view of the urgent need of more ships, that these skilled men should be exchanged for men who are unskilled, but would still remain available for Home Defence..   2. Surrender of Merchant Shipping by the Naval and Military AuthoritiesAs Mr. Runciman points out in his memorandum, our Committee in March last asked and obtained a conditional undertaking from the Admiralty and the War Office for the release of 200 steamers from their service. Continual pressure has met with some response, and the Committee appreciate the efforts made by the authorities concerned, but the full number of 200 has not been surrendered. [1235]Printed for the use of the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1916.
The Committee feel that the need for economy in tonnage by the Army and Navy is even greater to-day than it was when they made their recommendation on the subject to the Prime Minister on the 31st March, and accordingly they now renew it.3. Wheat.The Committee concur in what is written under this heading in the Memorandum. They consider, however, that the statement &quot; an additional 122 steamers of 25,000-quarters capacity for twelve months&apos; service &quot; errs, if anything, on the side of underestimating rather than exaggerating the amount of shipping required to lift the wheat.4. Neutral Steamers.In view of the increasing dependence of this country and all the Allies upon neutral tonnage, it would appear desirable that there should be some centralisation of chartering. A scheme has been prepared by this Committee, and, with this object in view, is now under consideration by the Board of Trade and Admiralty, which, it is hoped, may ease the situation in this direction.5. Dock Labour.The Committee have had under their attention the question of importing foreign labour for work at the docks.It is understood that it would not be possible to introduce foreign labour into this country on account of the Trade Unions. No similar difficulty, however, appears to present itself in France. The Committee therefore suggest that foreign labour (e.g., Portuguese) should be imported into France for Dock work in order that the British labour battalions now working at the French ports may be released and returned to this country.The Committee are also disposed to urge that the question of employment of enemy prisoners of war in British docks under conditions analogous to those which have been successfully adopted in French ports should be reconsidered.6. Congestion at French Ports.It is not only at British but even more at French ports, that the flow of traffic is being impeded. Ships are being delayed in French ports to an extent that is causing serious waste of tonnage. The two following, among many similar instances, have recently occurred : &quot; Thistleard&quot; 7,600 tons d.w-Arrived in Roads, Bordeaux, about 9th October. Docked Bordeaux about 27th October. Expected to be discharged 17th November.Say total five weeks, as compared with ten days in normal circumstances.&quot; Algeriana&quot; 7,370 tons d.w. Arrived in Roads, Bordeaux, 13th October. Still waiting berth, 30th October.With a view to preventing these delays, the- Committee feel that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be well advised to press the French Government to do everything in their power to improve the condition at the ports, in order that vessels may receive prompter despatch.Acting upon instructions from the War Committee, and with the sanction of the Admiralty and War Office, one of our members, Mr. Royden, made a special visit to certain of the ports in northern France in June last, and presented a report containing a number of valuable suggestions. Our information is that few of these have been carried into effect, and we again call attention to the matter.Similar, if - not worse, conditions prevail in the Bay ports of France, which, so far as we know, no sustained effort has been made to alleviate.
7. Horses for the British Army in France.On the 17th May the practicability of reducing&quot; the importation of horses into France was referred by us to the War Committee. It was pointed out that the transport of these animals in itself makes a large demand upon shipping and involves an increase in the large amount of tonnage already required for the transport of oats and forage. The reduction, however, for which the Committee hoped did not take place.The Shipping Control Committee are not competent to judge whether the use of cavalry on the western front is a near or remote possibility, and they are well aware that a very large number of horses are required in France for draught and other purposes, but they feel it incumbent upon them, in making these observations upon the shortage of shipping, again to point out the large amount of tonnage that is being used for the conveyance both of horses and fodder, and to express the hope that a careful investigation may be made into the horse supply problem in France, and particularly into the need of maintaining and feeding so large a force of cavalry as that which still exists there, but for which in the approaching winter it seems possible that no urgent use may be found.8. Submarine Attack on Merchant Shipping.The Committee have read with great interest the memorandum of the 14th October by the First Lord of the Admiralty on the subject of submarines. The evidence furnished in that memorandum supports entirely what was written by this Committee to the Admiralty on the 23rd August last, namely, that in their opinion : (a.) &quot; All merchant vessels should as far as possible be armed.(b.) &quot; If there are not sufficient guns to fit all the steamers, preference in thisrespect should be given to those vessels that are making voyages in theMediterranean.&quot;The Committee trust that effect is being given continuously to these recommendations.With regard to the concluding paragraphs of Mr. Balfour&apos;s memorandum relative to existing conditions and difficulties in the Mediterranean, the Committee continue to feel as they wrote to the Foreign Office on the 23rd August, that the active co-operation of the Allied Governments in the system of defence against submarines in those waters is urgently desirable.I am, &amp;c.CLEMENT JONES, Secretary. -2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., November 1, 1916.PBDTTBD AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BT C.
