Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   January T9.1G.SECRET.G-49MILITARY POLICY.Note- by Me. Chamberlain.SIR EDWARD GREY has sent me a copy of his secret memorandum on Military Policy. Like Sir Edward I am not&apos;a member of the War Committee, and attend only when summoned for special business ; but it so happens that I have been present on two occasions when the point raised by Sir Edward Grey has been under discussion.Under these circumstances I ask leave to express my agreement with the view put forward by Sir Edward Grey and with-the course which he proposes. All our information points to the fact that Germany is suffering severely under the double strain of her losses in the field and of our blockade. I am disposed to think that the strain is reaching a point which would be unbearable if it were not accompanied by apparent military success. But I see no prospect of a tolerable peace until the compulsion of military defeat is added to economic pressure.Again, it has to be remembered that the economic pressure is not all on one side. If the information supplied to the Finance Committee by the Treasury and the Board of Trade is correct, the economic pressure on our Allies must in any case become severe during the current year, whilst the possibility that wre may be unable to bear indefinitely the financial burden of our own operations as well as to give our Allies the support which they require cannot be overlooked. The inference which I draw from this survey is that we must make every effort to bring the Avar to a decisive stage as early as possible, and I agree with Sir Edward Grey that the only hope of so doing lies in a combined and practically simultaneous offensive by all the Allies.So far I have written as if the choice lay with the Allies. It appears to me, however, to be highly probable that, as soon as weather conditions permit, the Central Powers will again take the offensive in Russia and attempt either to drive Russia into a separate peace or at least to put her armies out of action. The moral effect of inaction on the part of the Western Allies during such an operation would, I think, be disastrous. I doubt whether the Russian Alliance would stand the strain of it. But in any case its military effect would surely be scarcely less harmful. It would enable the Central Powers once again to deal wuth the Allies piecemeal instead of securing the co-ordinated and simultaneous action of all of them, which was the keystone of the conclusions of the Chantilly Conference.On all grounds, therefore, I submit that Sir Edward Grey&apos;s conclusions are correct, and that every effort should be made to prepare for a great offensive, at our own time if the choice is left to us, or at an earlier date if the operations of the Central Powers menace Petrograd or Moscow.A.

ME M OKA N D 01. :;!the last meeting of the War Committee has left me with serious apprehension that the division of opinion there    is resulting in the paralysis of all strategy.I7e are preparing for nothing but a great offensive in the West;  but, if that is to be undertaken, it should not be in a half-hearted way :  it should he given a whole chance,    and     not    a half-chance.    All military opinion is united in favour of this offensive, as the right strategy and the only course open to us,  but the Military Authorities are now working under the impression that the Government will not allow the offensive to take place.I am much impressed by the arguments against the offensive, but I an still more impressed by the fact that all military opinion is united in favour of it and that nothing else is suggested as possible, except a prolonged defensive, to end in the exhaustion of Germany. I do not believe that a satisfactory peace can be secured only by the policy of exhausting Germany.    I think that Germany will be exhausted before another year is over., and that the same is true of others;   and, if things remain as they are, I think that there will he a sort  of general collapse and inconclusive peace before next Winter.       I believe that the only chance of victory is to hammer the Germans hard in the first eight months of this year.    If this is impossible,  we had better make up our minds to an inconclusive peace.      Subject, therefore * to any change of military opinion, I see nothing for it but to make every preparation for a great offensive in the West, combined with the best that we oar get out of a Russian offensive in the East.    If the decision remains in the state of suspense in which it was left at the last War Committee meeting, all the heart will be taken out of the Military Authorities.For these reasons, 1 would suggest that the decision be that the plan for a great offensive in the West holds the field:   that all preparations be made for it;  and that -  subject to any unforeseen event;, taking place to cause the question to be reconsidered,   or to
11military opinion in its favour being, shaken it  should    be&quot;proceeded with when the Military Authorities consider thai the time has come to begin it.With a view to determining this time, it seems to me essential to decide * as the Minister of Munitions has proposed, what accumulation of ammunition (and of what sorts of ammunition)    is necessary to make the offensive successful.    This is presumably a question for the Military Authorities, especially the Artillery experts.   Men this has been ascertained, the Ministries of Munitions here and in France will say when the required amount of aimiiunition will be available,Meanwhiles as far as is possible , information shall    be obtained from Russia with a view to co-ordinating Russian action in the East with$ the action of the Allies in the West.    Italian action would also, I suppose, be co-ordinated later on.I attend the War Committee only when there are matters in which diplomatic negotiations are concerned s  end I feel that the views that I have expressed deal with a subject that is rather beyond my province;   but my excuse is my anxiety left the difference  of opinion between the Military Authorities - both French and British, in the War Office and in the field    on the one side,  and some of the most important members of the Government on the other side, should end in paralysis of all plan and action,C.
