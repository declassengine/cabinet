Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   May 1916.SECRET.G.-70.THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN GREECE.MINUTE BY [LORD ROBERT CECIL ON II.Sir E. Grey,THE following extracts (II) are from a letter sent to rne by Mr. Talbot, of our Legation at Athens. Sir F. Elliot sends a covering letter endorsing the statements there made. I submit&apos; that if we desire the entry of Greece into the war we need take no accion. But if we do not we, should (1) make this clear, and (2) direct our Legation to cease to assist M. Yenizelos in every way. If M. Yenizelos succeeds Greece will come in, and we shail, or may be, honourably bound to support her to the utmost of our power. If that is our policy the War Office and Admiralty should be preparing for an active offensive from Salonica.May I say that this seems to me only one example of the urgent necessity for clearing up the Salonica situation ? The French desire an offensive from there; our military authorities are opposed to it. Meanwhile the French have imported the Serbians, the Greeks are boiling up for action, a large British force is waiting there. Is it not certain that when the due moment comes the French will produce an incident, and we shall be committed to am offensive for which we have made no adequate preparations.   That seems to me the worst of all ways of making war.R. C.May 10, 1916.II.EXTRACTS FROM A LETTER FROM Mr. GERALD F. TALBOT TOLORD ROBERT CECIL. Dear Lord Robert Cecil, Athens, April 6, 1916.*5  ^ &quot;fc wYOU may perhaps remember that I read over to you the programme which M. Yenizelos communicated to me confidentially, by which he aspired to accomplish the realisation of his policy of Greek intervention on the side of the Allies. The first steps in his programme for instituting an effective propaganda were : 1. The establishment of a more definite central organisation for directing the policy of the Liberal party, for distribution of feuilletons, &amp;c, and, if possible, for the publication of an official Liberal party journal for the exposition of his own views.2. The distribution throughout the country of a number (of from 300 upwards) of capable men who should tour the different parts of Greece, expounding the policy of the Liberal party, and preaching the doctrine of Greek intervention on the side of the Allies.3. The strengthening, by a system of subsidies, of the Liberal press, to enable them to overcome the existing crisis caused by the heavy increase in the cost of paper, and to enable them to work in a free and unhampered manner in the interest of the Entente cause.4. As the position improved, and public opinion became strengthened in favour of the Allies&apos; cause and in favour of the policy of the Greek Liberal party, which is [591] -   &quot; B
identified with the Allies&apos; cause, it was proposed that the Liberal party should commence a series of interventionist meetings, on an organised scale, in the principal towns and throughout the country.5. Subsequently, when the position was fully developed, and at a moment selected by M. Venizelos himself on a suitable occasion, such as might be presented by a decisive Allied victory on either front, or by an Allied advance from Salonica on a large scale, Venizelos himself proposed to lead a popular manifestation in favour of intervention and war against, firstly, Bulgaria.To enable the Liberal party to commence their concentrated propaganda on the lines of the above-mentioned bases, it was necessary for the Liberal party to obtain financial support for the establishment of a party fund.You may remember that I mentioned to you M. Venizelos&apos;s decision not to accept any subscriptions for his party&apos;s fund other than from persons of Greek nationality, though ho would be glad to accept subscriptions from the well-to-do Greek subjects living in France and England.On my return from England, M. Venizelos informed me that he had obtained con-siderable subscriptions from Greek subjects in France. From information gathered here from other Venizelist (and Liberal) sources, I have reason to believe that the sum placed at the disposal of his party amounts to 80,000Z., and that this sum has come either through or from M, Zacharoff, a very wealthy Greek living in Paris. A definite central organisation and bureau have now been established, arid the Liberal party are now issuing their official organ, a paper called the &quot; Kyrix,&quot; every &quot;week, containing a long expose of the political situation, written, I understand, on each occasion by M. Venizelos himself. The new paper is Very popular, and has been sold out on each publication to the number of about 15,000 copies, the limit of its present printing capacity.*fe ^ ^ ^ *^Public.opinion has for several weeks past been rapidly increasing in our favour. Most of those people whose sympathies were alienated from our cause were influenced by artificial means, by the money that Baron Schenk and the German Legation dealt out with both hands in support of journalistic and of every other kind of propaganda during the many months at the commencement of the war that they had the field to themselves. A large number were affected, too, by the myth of German invincibility and the widely-spread story of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Germans who would come down to drive us out of Salonica, before proceeding to the devastation of Greece, if Greece dared to help Serbia and our cause. This theory was actively supported here &quot; in high places/&apos; and was widely propagated by the Army General Staff, and by those of the army officers who desired or required their favours. The public now recognises that this was all a myth, and the keen desire, which preponderates in the soul of the majority of Greeks, to come to the rescue of the winning side is turning them more and more in our favour in proportion as the artificially created idea of German invincibility is diminished by the growing evidence of German non-successes at Verdun, and their non-capacity to carry out, or even to attempt, their mnch-vaunted boast of hurling the Allied troops into the sea at Salonica.The natural, uninfluenced, inclination of the average Greek would lead him to favour the British and French at all times, I think, on general lines, and for general reasons. The average Greek is extremely intelligent, and, as a rule, he, who has no sentimental or other reason for preferring the British and French to the Germans and Austrians, does so because lie is sufficiently intelligent to appreciate that his own, and his country&apos;s, interests are closely bound up with England and France. I think that i,t was principally the feeling of fear, skilfully spread by the German propaganda here, coupled with the artificially created conviction that it was contrary to the interests of Greece to intervene with us and risk the visitation of countless hordes of Germans, that turned many of the people here against us.For many weeks past, however, the general public have been realising more and more thoroughly that they have been &quot; bluffed&quot; and deceived; they see their hereditary enemies, the Bulgars, all arouDd their frontiers and occasionally crossing th em; their confidence in the ultimate victory of the Allies is growing daily. They are losing their fear of the Germans and increasing in anger against their old enemies, the Bulgars... . All these considerations are having a rapidly-growing effect on the people, the majority of whom are also becoming more and more disgusted with the present, apparently helpless, Greek Ministry, under whose rule the condition of the country
and of the people is going from bad to worse. Dissatisfaction with the present Government is increasing very much, and the people, understanding that the present Governments policy is in opposition to the pro-Ententist policy of M. Venizelos, are being influenced in our favour also by their realisation of the incompetence of the existing Government, and the lamentable condition to which the country is being reduced by the drifting anti-Entente policy of the Cabinet of Scouloudis.The soldiers of the mobilised army and the lower classes at home are openly discontented the former principally because they are maintained under arms away from their families, suffering many of the discomforts of war, month after month, for no apparent reason; the latter because, in the case of most families, they are reduced to direst poverty by the absence of their breadwinners, who have been compelled to leave home for the regiment, without any apparent prospect of either fighting their enemies or of returning to work for the support of their families.-Amongst the more educated classes, and amongst the officers, large numbers who had been influenced against the -pro-Entente policy of M. Venizelos are now turning again in favour of his policy, influenced now in part by their appreciation of the manner in which they had been bluffed and deceived into joining the anti-Entente movement by the artificially created fear of Germany, and in part by their open dissatisfaction with the present Ministry, its incompetence, its introduction into Greece of the Turkish secret police and spying methods and practices, and its incapacity to save the country from sliding rapidly into a condition of bankruptcy, or to do anything to alleviate the distress of the lower classes.The rule  or absence of rule of the present Government has contributed much to bringing back those of the people who had been artificially influenced against the Allies to their old conviction that Greece&apos;s destinies and prosperity are linked with those of England and France, and they are beginning to forget that the Allies asked them to sacrifice certain of their territories to their enemies the Bulgars ; for, in considering the influences of the respective propaganda in Greece, it must.be remembered that one of the main planks in the platform of our enemies&apos; policy has always been constituted by the theory that England especially -even though at war with Bulgaria always main-tains a warm corner in her heart for the Bulgarians; and many Greeks still fear that the influence of the Buxtons and Bourchier may continue to find protection for Bulgaria eventually, no matter who may go to war against her and assist in bringing about her downfall.M. Venizelos and the Liberal party find that the position here has so much improved in favour of his policy that they are encouraged to take now two more of the steps comprised in the Venizelist programme, referred to at the commencement of this letter. I am informed that on Sunday next (9th April) the Liberal party will commence to hold a series of meetings in favour of a return to the Venizelist policy of intervention (see No. 4 above) ; meetings are to be held on that day in the largest theatres of Athens and Piraeus, and these are to be followed by a series of other meetings on an organised basis. All the former Venizelist deputies and candidates, to the number of about 300, will then be sent to their respective constituencies throughout the country to hold meetings and give conferences, and, in general, to prepare the way for a popular manifestation at a suitable moment in favour of the return to power of the Venizelistparty with their interventionist policy.* * * * &apos;      * %Matters have changed, and the position has altered here so much in comparison with the state of affairs which existed even a very few months ago that it is now extremely rare to find any Greek who will insist that Greece should remain neutral to the end.In discussing Greece&apos;s position with the so-called &amp;nti-Ententists or anti-Venizelists there is no argument which rouses now so much opposition with individual Greeks as the suggestion that Greece has missed her opportunity, and that nobody now wants her to take part in the war; I have tried this line of discussion with many anti-Venizelist (so-called) politicians, and I find that invariably, in each case, the particular individual immediately launches out into every kind of argument to prove that it is not too late, that Greece must intervene, and that Greece&apos;s army can still render great services to the cause rof the Entente. It is interesting to note that even the newsagents and boys, those of whom are selling violently a,nti-Entente papers in the streets on every possible occasion, shout out news of British, Russian, or French victories, or of German or their allies&apos; defeats ; it is never the other way. They find that it does not help the sale of the papers if they call out about German victories, even if the anti-Ententist papers[591] B 2
they may be selling are filled with a liberal supply of Wolff Bureau news of German successes.- * * * *. * *As far as the internal and external policies of Greece are concerned, I think that I am right in saying that there are now only two parties in Greece : the Liberal party, under the leadership-of Yenizelos, who are purely and simply openly pro-English and pvo-Ententist, on the basis that Greece&apos;s destinies and fortune are irrevocably linked with those of England and the Entente, who are sure to win the war; and the Governmental -or Anti-Yenizelist party, now in office the mainspring of which is M. Gounaris.The Government themselves, by the mouth of the Prime Minister, M. Scouloudis, proclaim officially their policy of benevolent neutrality towards the Entente, against whom they actually pursue a policy of passive resistance; they are nominally supported in the Chamber by a.full House of incompetent deputies, nominated by them-selves and elected without competition by something less than one-third of the people against the tacit opposition of two-thirds of the people. They are supported by a limited section of the press, who are openly a,nti-Ententist and pro-German, and who never cease to hurl every kind of insult and abuse against Great Britain and France and Yenizelos, understanding that by so doing they are supporting the present Ministry and preventing the return to power of M. Yenizelos. M. Gounaris himself receives the enemy journalists every night, and gives himself the satisfaction of encouraging them in their slanderous attacks against the. Entente, &quot; who are sure to be crushed by Germany,&quot; and against M. Yenizelos, on account of his pro-Entente policy. Gounaris acts comparatively openly as our enemy, and with his press influence and his secret service spy organisation, and by any other method that occasion may offer, he does what he can. to injure our prestige, although at times, when the Government as a body have blundered too badly in some direction or when the urgent necessity of a loan from the Entente threatens to jeopardise the very existence of the present Government and the dignity of the Crown, then Gounaris will reluctantly subject himself to the restraining persuasiveness of Scouloudis and his elderly colleagues, and the Ministry revert for the time necessary to their official policy of &quot; benevolent neutrality&quot; towards the Entente.There is no doubt that a number of those who oppose the Entente only do so because they are opposed to M. Yenizelos on principle, whatever his policy may be. For that reason there are undoubtedly a certain number of people at present opposed to the Entente who themselves are-at heart &quot;ipr o-Ententist.vThe fact remains, however, that the policy of the Yenizelist (Liberal) party is so absolutely interwoven and bound up with England and Franee and their success in the war &quot; that our cause is right and that we are sure to win &quot; that anything that we can do here to advance our cause is ipso facto assisting the policy of M. Yenizelos, in precisely the same way that anything that M. Yenizelos can achieve to strengthen his policy and increase the number of his adherents is ipso facto strengthening our position and increasing the number of our supporters.As far as the people are concerned there are no other parties or policies or party leaders; there exist only the Yenizelist (Liberal) or pvo-Ententist party and the anti-Venizelist or anti-Ententist party, with their official policy of benevolent neutrality. The former are supported by Yenizelos and the whole of the Liberal party, and the latter are supported by our enemies and their friends.The King has several times said to Greeks that he was Greek before all things, and that when his people showed him in unmistakable manner that they desired a change of policy he would not hesitate to adapt his policy to meet the wishes of his people, even to the extent of intervention in the European war.As events and public opinion are moving at present, on account of the reasons which I have endeavoured to explain above, it seems more and more likely that public opinion will not continue long to put up with the present Government, and then, in the opinion of most people, we may most probably see the appointment of a Government under M. Zaimis, which would be generally considered as a stepping-stone towards the ultimate return, at no very distant date, of M. Venizelos. Then, I presume, the Entente Powers will finally decide whether or not they wish Greece to intervene in the war.44&quot; ^ ^rt&quot;Yours very truly,GERALD F. TALBOT.
LETTER FROM SIR, F. ELLIOT TO LORD ROBERT CECIL.Dear Lord Robert Cecil, Athens, April 8, 1916.Mr. GERALD TALBOT has shown me the letter he is sending you by this bag. Although I had no part whatever in the composition of it, I concur in every word, and should be very glad if you could treat it as an official document emanating from this legation.

ELLIOT.FEINTED AT THE FOBEIGN OFFICE BT C. B. HARBISON. 15/5/1916.
