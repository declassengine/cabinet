SECRET.G.-98.SUPPLY OF AEROPLANES.Memorandum by the Minister oe Munitions. (Previous Papers, Nos. 0.-77, G.-83, and G.-84.)1. THE Prime Minister indicated recently, in answer to questions in the House of Commons, that he was awaiting memoranda from certain departments, among, them the Ministry of Munitions, on &quot;the Report of the Air Board. My views on that &quot;part of .the ground covered by the Report which concerns the Ministry of- Munitions . were put before the War Committee in two previous memoranda, but as the question -has hot yet been discussed, and as my proposal to take over the supply of aircraft has not been fully understood, I have prepared the following memorandum:  -. 2. In my first memorandum (G.-77, September 1916), I stated my. conviction that a centralisation of supply for the two Air Services was necessary in order to make the best possible use of such manufacturing capacity as remains available, and in order to ensure economy of material and labour,.-;.&apos; Should the War Committee accept this position, it will be necessary to decide by whom this single supply service is to be controlled. Lord Curzon has given us his opinion that supply should be the concern of the Air Board, and that a Bill should be - passed to give them powers to undertake the work. I have already presented, to the War Committee two memoranda setting out my reasons for thinking that this is not the proper solution, and- that the supply of aircraft should be in the hands of the Ministry, of Munitions, who are already responsible for the supply of so many other munitions of war, and who, by force of circumstances, have acquired control of the remaining manufacturing and engineering resources of the country. A Bill giving similar powers to another department seems to me unnecessary, and certain to cause confusion.3. I am afraid that, although I have studied Lord Curzon&apos;s memoranda carefully, I cannot find that he has advanced any serious reasons against my alternative proposal that supply should be in the hands of the Ministry of Munitions. In his latest memorandum, dated the 15th November, he states the Air Board&apos;s two objections to this plan.   With each of these; 1 thought I had dealt in my earlier memoranda.4. The first is that in the present state of aeroplane design, when constant change is an essential factor in the problem,, it is necessary to establish &quot; the most intimate connection between the man using the machine and the manufacturer producing it.&quot; I can only repeat what I said in my second memorandum (G.-S4, 16th October), that I find it difficult to see why the intervention of a Supply Department, which was part of the Ministry of Munitions, should endanger. that close touch any more than the intervention of a Supply Department which was independent of the Ministry. I assume, of course, that I should have the benefit of the assistance of, at any rate, a number of those officers who have hitherto been responsible to their respective Departments for the supply of aircraft material.5. Secondly, Lord Curzon states that the Ministry of Munitions exists to produce quantities of standard munitions, and would not readily brook repeated changes of design which interfered with output. I can only repeat that unfortunately the problem of obtaining production of an article the specification of which is continually changing in the light of experience is one with which the Ministry is only too familiar. The Supply Department of the Ministry have no choice but to accept changes of design prescribed by those responsible for design, while pointing out their effect on output. .

6. I think I must explain in some detail what the method of work in the Ministry is, because I feel that my proposals must have been misunderstood. We have in this office a Design Department, a Contracts Department, a Finance Department, an Inspection Department, and various Supply Departments. A requirement for a particular article is received by the appropriate branch of the Secretariat, This, is forwarded to the Supply Department which is concerned with that article. If the article is not of a standard type, the requirement may be for an article which shall serve certain stated purposes or comply with certain stated conditions. In this case the Design Department prepares a design&apos; in consultation (if necessary) with the War Office and the Supply Department, and sends the design by the Supply Department, which then proceeds to manufacture either in its own works or by placing contracts through the agency of the Contracts Branch, which works in co-operation with the Finance Branch. A letter is then written to the Army Council stating how far and by what date their requirement will be fulfilled, and they are kept informed as to any alteration in the estimate due to unforeseen contingencies or to changes in design (with which we are constantly confronted, because we keep in close touch with the users of the article). When the goods are ready they are inspected by officers of the Inspection Department and then handed over to representatives of the War Office.7. The business of supply is thoroughly organised, and is now working as smoothly as can- be expected. I should like to explain in more detail the work of the Supply Department. Its business is to obtain manufacturing capacity, to send its requirements for raw material to the Baw Material Branch, for labour to the Labour Department, for tools to the Tool Department, and so on. It lias the advantage of all the machinery elaborated during the last fifteen months for controlling labour, manufacturers, importers, and merchants, together with the local organisations of the best business men in the country, who can put the Supply Departments into touch through the Director of Area Organisation with the manufacturing capacity existing in their particular localities.8. Now, let us suppose that we undertake the manufacture of something which formerly another Derjartrnent has manufactured. All the machinery is immediately available, but the staff has to be reinforced by transfers. I will take the most recent case, not because it affords any necessary analogy to aeroplanes, but because it will explain my meaning. We were asked by the War Office to undertake the supply of motor transport. A new branch was immediately created. In it there was a representative of the Finance Department, of the Contracts Department, and so on. The existing machinery was immediately applied to the new requirement. We had not the staff with the necessary technical knowledge or experience for the supply of motor transport. But we did not leave manufacturers accustomed to deal with particular individuals to deal with new individuals. We did not set people who were accustomed to inspect shell fuzes to inspect motor-cars. We proceeded, in consultation, with the War Office, to engage their experts, who joined our staff and carried on their old work, assisted, invigorated, and organised by the fact that the experience and general machinery of supply in war time which the Ministry of Munitions possesses was placed at their disposal.9. If aeroplane supply were transferred to the Ministry of Munitions, the procedure would be much the same. Our business would be to receive requirements and to deal with them on the system indicated. If the requisitioning authority wished to keep design I should offer no objection. I would only ask for the closest possible connection to be set up between the Design and the Supply Departments. I should like to take over as many as was considered desirable of the staff at present dealing with supply, but it would be quite easy, in consultation with those at present responsible, to fit the new branch into the existing organisation of the Ministry. .10. I hear rumours that generals in the field and generals at home are opposed to them. I cannot see that they are concerned in the matter. I claim no word in policy or in allocation as Minister of Munitions. These have never been, and are not now, part or parcel of what is only a Supply Department. I am told that some manufacturers resent the suggested transfer to the Ministry of Munitions. I cannot believe that, if&apos; this is so, it is for any other reason than that they think that they will have to deal with people who understand shells, but not aeroplanes. I am told that.dying men object to it. I am confident that, if this is so, it is because they have been told that in some mysterious wdj the Royal Flying Corps will be under the control of the Ministry of Munitions, or because they think that aeroplanes will be supplied to them by people who understand only explosives.
11. It will be noticed that I speak of the &quot; requisitioning authority.&quot; It does not affect my proposal whether this is the War Office, the Admiralty, or the Air Board. But as a member of the War Committee, I feel that it would be far better if it were the Air Board, and that the Air Board should decide the policy and the allocation of the machines. It would be impertinent for me to criticise the composition of the Air Board, for I know nothing of its work, and Lord Curzon is the only one of my colleagues who can give us information on this. I should have preferred an Air Board0 consisting only of a Lord of the Admiralty, whose whole time would be occupied wdth Air ; a member of the Army Council, who would be responsible for the lioyal Plying Corps; and a chairman, with a representative in the House of Commons. Tim head of the Aeronautical Department of the Ministry would of course always be available to discuss matters with the Air Board. If this machinery were adopted I cannot help feeling that we should get away from the demerits of the Board about which Mr. Balfour has written, and merely have a co-ordination of Admiralty and War Office requirements and policy, with the War Committee always as a Court of Appeal.12. In conclusion, I would just summarise my reasons for preferring my proposal to Lord Curzon&apos;s alternative proposal, that the Air Board should become, clothed with new statutory authority, another competing agency in the engineering and labour market (a.) The problem of obtaining surplus production in a market in which supplies fall continually short of demand is the problem to meet which the Ministiy of Munitions was created.(b.) An increase of manufacturing capacity has been encouraged through the protection afforded from financial risks by the placing of extended orders, while at the same time the absence of competition has promoted economy.(c.) Competition between contractors for machine tools, labour, and materials has been stopped, with the result that wastage, overlapping, and friction have been reduced to a minimum.(d.) Priority given by contractors to particular orders has been governed by urgency, and not by consideration of profit, and, so far as possible, firms have been prevented from playing off one Department against another.(e.) The demand for increased production of aircraft engines must fall largely on the motor manufacturers, who alone have the necessary skilled labour and management. These firms are already deeply engaged on engines for motor transport and other work for the Ministry of Munitions.(/.) Increase of output by assigning particular firms to aircraft work only, as suggested by Lord Curzon, is impossible. Increase can only be obtained by widely distributing orders for parts among firms already almost fully occupied. This method has proved successful with articles requiring such a high degree of accuracy as rifles, fuzes, and gun-carriages.(g.) Successful broadening of the basis of production on these lines requires an intimate knowledge of firms and their capacities.(h.) This knowledge is possessed by the Ministry of Munitions staff, local and central.(i.) The Ministry of. Munitions has behind it nearly eighteen months of experience of success and failure, and has, on the ground, an organisation expressly devised to stimulate production and to get the last ounce out of the engineering trade.(fe.) The Ministry of Munitions is at present responsible for the elaborate and intricate system of regulation of labour, which applies to aeroplane as to other engineering works. It will only cause chaos and confusion if similar powers are now conferred on the Air Board.[I.) It will tend to economy of man power if the Department already responsible for labour in aeroplane works is also made responsible for the placing of orders in those works.Yd. All that I ask is one further extension of what I think seems to be the accepted principle, that the Ministry of Munitions should be used as an ironmongers shop for all requirements of the Government, so far as is possible without great dislocation and changes during the war. Our policy always has been to reduce and not to increase the number of agencies that are obtaining supplies through the whole of the world in engineering matters.    The same principle has just been
extended by the War Committee to agricultural implements, and I do not think that there is any reason to go back on the principle in aeroplanes.I am perfectly certain that none of my colleagues will think that I take this view because I happen at the moment to be Minister of Munitions. The Prime Minister at least will remember that I took this view long before I had the tremendous burden of my present office.E.S. M., November 24, 1916. &apos;PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY O. R.
