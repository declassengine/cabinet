Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1916.SECRET. G.-86.Report on Recent Naval Affairs.  October 1916.I.-MATERIEL.IN the Battle of Jutland we lost 3 Battle cruisers, 3 Armoured cruisers, 8 Destroyers ;and on the day after the battle the Grand Eleet con-sisted of 31 Battleships.7 Battle cruisers.10 Armoured cruisers.35 Light cruisers.135 Destroyers and flotilla leaders.37 Submarines.Some of these were more or less seriously damaged, hut all have long since been repaired. Two light cruisers were, however, sunk by submarine attack on the 19th August, and &quot; Hampshire &quot; and one destroyer have been mined, so that Grand Eleet losses since the 30th May amount to 3 Battle cruisers, 4 Armoured cruisers, 2 Light cruisers, and 9 Destroyers.In the same period we have put into commission   Battleships,2 Battle cruisers,1 Special light cruiser, &apos; 2 Light cruisers, 38 Destroyers and flotilla leaders, 15 Submarines.&apos;;and all these additions to our naval strength have joined or are joining the Grand Eleet&apos;.At the moment of writing the comparative strength] of the Grand Eleet and. the German High Seas Eleet, so? far as our information goes, is as follows :-Grand Fleet.High rieas Fleet.Battleships       ..         .. 31 25*Battle cruisers   ..         .. 9 4j-Armoured cruisers          .. 5 3Light cruisers   ..         .. 38 18 Destroyers    and    flotillaleaders         ...      .. 166 110C 35 large.Submarines       ..         .. 48 67^.19 small.(^13 small minelayers.* Including 7 pre-Dreadnoughts.t Including &quot; Derfllinger,&quot; whose repairs have apparently not yet been completed.[1176] b
It is probably unnecessary to remind the War Committee that the fighting ships of the Grand Fleet which I have just enumerated are but a portion and numerically a very small portion of the total number of vessels employed on Admiralty service in northern waters. There are in the Thames the &quot; Dreadnought &quot; and five &quot;King Edward&quot; battleships under the com-mand of Admiral de Robeek, There are a very large number of destroyers, patrol boats, sloops, trawlers, and drifters under the command of the various Admirals round the coast to say nothing of the large number of vessels employed in sweeping mines.The size of these home fleets, though enormous, is still insufficient, and every effort is being made to augment it. Of capital ships we have indeed nearly reached the limit of immediate production. The last &quot;Dreadnought&quot; which is likely to take apart in the present war may be expected to join the fleet in the spring of 1917 ; and though the Admiralty have designed and laid down capital ships of a new and powerful type, we can hardly conceive of their coming into use before peace is declared.For all types of vessels, however, from light cruisers downwards, the demand seems unlimited. Do what we will it is impossible fully to meet the demands of the Cbmmander-in-Ohief for light cruisers and destroyers. Of the latter we have not as yet got nearly enough to meet our needs for escort and anti-submarine work; and though they are coming in at the rate of six or more a month, we shall certainly never have enough for ourselves-still less shall we have enough for our Allies. The position as regards light cruisers is not much better. But in the matter of submarines, minesweepers, and minelayers there is a much smaller difference between what our Admirals desire and what we are in a position to give.This summary account of our naval resources in northern waters would be very incomplete if no reference were made to what has been and is being done to create and strengthen naval bases on the East Coast. The land defences of Harwich, the Humber, and the Tyne have been or are being strengthened by the War Office, but the greatest work has been accomplished on the Firth of Forth. When the war broke out the site of Rosyth had been acquired, but the dockyard was not near completion, nor was there any anti-submarine protec-tion. We now possess a dockyard where our biggest ships can be refitted, and we shall soon possess a well-guarded anchorage where the Grand Fleet (or the greater part of it) can lie in security. In addition, therefore, to subsidiary bases like Cromarty and the Humber, we shall in a few weeks have alternative anchorages at Scapa and the Firth of Forth which will accommodate the largest fleets, one of them being furnished with all the plant necessary for repairs, even on a large scale.II.-STRATEGY.There is now a general agreement among all the n&amp;val authorities concerned as to the proper strategy of the Grand Fleet at this stage of hostilities. To maintain the blockade of Germany, which is an often-
sive operation, and to defend our own shores from, invasion, which is a defensive operation, are the two main functions which (at the present moment) the Grand Fleet has got to perform. It could perform them best by destroying the German High Seas Fleet, but so long as the German High Seas Fleet bears its present proportion to the Grand Fleet it may be unwilling to fight; and all officers who have had practical experience of modern fleet tactics seem to be of opinion that there is no safe or effectual method of forcing&apos; battle upon the German fleet owing to geo-graphical considerations.This is unfortunate, for the naval problems presented by the North Sea and the Baltic would be enormously simplified if the German Fleet, which now has an impregnable base on interior lines, ceased to be a fleet &quot; in being.&quot; Of this the Germans themselves are, no doubt, fully aware. There are those who argue that, while the Germans have everything to gain by a victory in the North Sea, they have nothing to lose by defeat, for a defeated German Fleet would not be more im-potent than a fleet permanently locked up in German ports. But such critics forget, among other things, that a German defeat in the North Sea might give Russia a naval superiority in the Baltic, and that a Russian naval superiority in the Baltic would be a serious menace to the north coast of Germany.Probably, therefore, the German policy apart from submarines, on which I shall say a word presently is to avoid a general action in the North Se&amp;, while doing everything possible gradually to whittle down the strength of the Grand Fleet till something approaching equality is attained. The most hopeful method of carrying but this scheme is to tempt the British into the southern portion of the North Sea, which is crowded with mines and haunted by submarines, by holding out hopes of a general action. The general action would be refused; but in the meanwhile some very unpleasant accidents might happen to our fighting ships. &quot;We lost two light cruisers on the 19th August; next time we might lose two battle cruisers, yet never get a shot at the enemy. The Commander-in-Chief and Admiral Beatty are therefore of opinion (and the Admiralty agree with them) that the proper way of dealing with this situation is to retain the Grand Fleet in the North unless and until the Germans have so far committed themselves to a forward movement that they cannot retire to their own base without trying conclusions with the British.Objection may perhaps be taken to this policy on the ground that, if the greater part of the Grand Fleet is (say) at Scapa, it will be possible for German battle cruisers to raid the British coast and escape before they are caught; while the British battle cruisers stationed in the Forth would have to take the utmost care lest in pursuing the German battle cruisers they should get into contact with the High Seas Fleet in a position where the Grand Fleet could give them no effective support.It must be remembered, however, that we have done (and are doing) much to strengthen the defences on our East Coast. It would now be a very rash proceeding to send valuable battle cruisers across the North Sea merely for the purpose  of shelling an
English coast town. It is improbahle that ,they would do damage of any military importance, and it is certain that they would run very serious risks. They would come under the fire of heavy guns at Newcastle, Hartle-pool, Grimsby, Yarmouth, Lowestoft, and Harwich; and in addition to heavy guns, there is a large and increasing force of submarines based on the East Coast which greatly add to our security both against raids and invasion.Probably most of us would prefer that the part played by the fleet should in appearance be more rigorous and aggressive ; but there can be no doiibt that the policy recommended by the War Staff, and the Commander-in-Chief is the one most embarrassing to the Germans. What the enemy would like to see would be a series of small and inconclusive operations in which bv a timelv retirement their own battle fleet would avoid a disaster, while by mines and submarines we should lose a ship here and a ship there till the cumu-lative effect became serious. Most of all, our opponents would probably like to see us attempt operations in the Baltic. Such a campaign has a great attraction for some people whose opinion is not to be lightly dismissed; but I doubt whether it would be approved by any sailor with war experience. The ordinary approach to the Baltic (the Sound), is too shallow to permit any of our large ships to go through. Every approach without exception is heavily mined at the southern or German end; all are within easy reach of the great arsenal of Kiel; and it would be quite impossible to force a way through without serious loss. The effort would be more costly than the naval attempt on the Dardanelles and there is no military prize comparable to. Constantinople to reward our efforts if we succeeded. I will not, how-ever, attempt in this paper to argue the Baltic policy, seeing that on the present War Committee it has so far found no friends.III. SUBMARINES.Of all the problems which the Admiralty have to consider, no doubt the most formidable and the most embarrassing is that raised by submarine attack on merchant vessels. No conclusive answer has yet been discovered to this mode of warfare; perhaps no con-clusive answer ever will be found. We must for the present be content with palliation. Nevertheless, we are not wholly helpless; and I will endeavour&apos; to describe what has been and is being done to diminish an evil which unfortunately we cannot wholly cure.  *Nets, with or without mines, moored or towed by drifters; armed small craft from destroyers and sub-marines down to; motor-launches; decoys; defensive armament on merchant ships; airshijDS and seaplanes acting as scouts are the only active antidotes that we possess to the submarine menace. It is by the use of these, combined with a system by which the routes of our own merchant ships are selected and varied, and the times of their departure and arrival are fixed, that we combat to the best of our ability the submarine menace.We began the war with no anti-submarine netting at all; we have manufactured in the last two and a half years
3,130 miles of light nets and 280 miles of heavy nets. We began the war with 270 small craft; we have now got nearly 3,000 of all kinds in full commission. These of course consist mainly of armed trawlers and drifters, but there has been an immense growth in other types of vessel specially adapted for patrol work. We have built 127 destroyers and flotilla leaders since J uly 1914, and these additions to our fleet are stronger, faster, and better suited to keep the sea than their predecessors. We have built 77 sloops, 23 patrol boats, and 79 sub-marines. The primary function of these latter is not indeed to attack enemy submarines, but they have occasionally been used with success for this purpose, and may perhaps be yet more used in the future.A large measure of success has attended these efforts. To speak only of the military aspects of the problem, we have. poured an unceasing stream of men and munitions across the Channel. We have brought across the oceans great bodies of troops from the Dominions, and we have supplied two armies in the Eastern Mediterranean. Our losses in the course of these operations have so far been singularly small. No doubt fortune has greatly favoured us, but, when all due allowance has been made for luck, we may still claim that where our protective measures can be fully applied they meet with a large measure of success. I cannot doubt that the Germans would rather sink British ships than Norwegian ships, and certainly they would rather cut the lines of communication between England and Erance than obtain any other military success. Indeed, all other military successes would automatically follow. If, therefore, the crowded sea routes adjacent to our shores are relatively immune compared with the Norwe-,gian coasts or the Mediterranean, credit must surely be given to the skill, courage, and endurance of our patrol-ling fleets.It is true, no doubt, that even the best protected waters cannot be kept free from submarines. The Germans, for example, possess in the Bight of Heligo-land an area close to their principal maritime bases, where, free from distant responsibilities, they can con-centrate all their anti-submarine craft, and supplement them at will with Zeppelins and seaplanes. Yet with all their efforts, they have never been able to keep even these narrow waters clear of submarines. Easy as their task might seem, they have not been able to accom-plish it. *Our task, unfortunately, is incomparably more diffi-cult, and complete success is quite out of the question. We have done, and can do, much, as I have already explained, to police the immediate approaches to our ports and to guard the places where the great lines of seaborne commerce converge. But were our strength ten times greater than it is, we could not effectually cover the vast spaces of the Atlantic with patrols; nor is it even easy to see how we are to cope with submarines which lie in wait off harbours like New York or Buenos Aires. The most effectual way of meeting these dangers is no doubt to make the land and leave the land in hours of darkness; and when in mid-ocean, to follow a course which submarines cannot anticipate. The immensity of the ocean area, which helps the enemy by making patrol impossible, hinders him by leaving a multitude of -alternative routes open to the object of his attack. [1176] C
There is a third method of defence at least as important as the two I have just mentioned, and that is gun power. In the early days of the war submarines trusted practically entirely to the torpedo. But all oversea submarines are now armed with guns, and the size of the guns is steadily increasing. This evolution, in which we were the pioneers, was predestined and inevitable. Against an unarmed merchant-ship the gun is a much more formidable weapon than the torpedo. It can be fired at an immensely greater range, and from any position. The speed of the modern submarine is greater than the speed of a modern cargo-boat; and if the latter is once sighted, her fate-if she has no defensive armament is inevitable.This is by no means the case if the submarine confines herself to attack by torpedo. No doubt if the merchant-ship comes blindly upon a submarine lying submerged in the right position, she would be destroyed before she knew she was in peril. But it is not so simple a thing as it may seem to torpedo even an unarmed ship which sees her enemy in time and does her best to escape. Moreover, the number of torpedoes a submarine can carry is limited, and she is chary of wasting them.The best protection, however, for a merchant-ship is a defensive gun. A submarine armed only with torpedoes would certainly not engage in a running fight with such an enemy. She would either sink her by surprise or not at all. Even a submarine armed with guns would hardly think it worth while to engage a merchant-ship if the latter had an efficient and well-served weapon with which to make reply. Eor the submarine is a delicate instrument, costly to make and difficult to man.   Its life must not be unnecessarily risked.The truth of this statement is well shown in some figures I have- already given the &quot;War Committee in another connection, and which I may here repeat. It seems that from the 1st January, 1916, to the 7th Sep-tember last, out of 122 unarmed vessels attacked by submarines on the surface, 100 were sunk, while only 22 made good their escape. On the other hand, of 78 defensively armed vessels similarly attacked, 71 made good their escape and only 7 were sunk.The moral to be drawn from these figures is striking, and it seems to be reinforced by the German attacks on neutral shipping which have culminated in the recent destruction of no less than 13 Norwegian ships in northern latitudes. Policy as well as passion must incline the Germans to concentrate their efforts in the main against British, rather than neutral, shipping. England (as they are for ever proclaiming) is their chief enemy ; but they have plenty of others and they can-not wish to add to their number. If, then, whaf seems to be a disproportionate amount of neutral tonnage is destroyed by their submarines, it must presumably be in part due to the fact that neutral merchant-ships are always unarmed; that we are unable to protect the waters round their coasts as effectively as we protect the narrow seas; and that we cannot prescribe sailing routes for their merchant captains.The protection of commerce in the Mediterranean is attended with special difficulties. There nature has marked out more narrowly than in the Atlantic the lines which seaborne commerce must follow.   The naval
control is divided between the French, the Italians, and ourselves. Our Allies are very ill-provided with the necessary small craft; and though we have given them all we can, and a great deal more than they possess or can build, the deficiency is serious. It must he added that the Italian fleet does not show much enterprise, and that the distribution of its destroyers is determined rather in accordance with the political pressure applied to the Government by individual Deputies than by the broad strategic necessities of the situation. The French are showing much energy; but it cannot be denied that the submarine difficulty, which is everywhere causing so much anxiety, is specially acute in the Medi-terranean.I do not suppose the Committee desire any special detailed information about naval proceedings in the Red Sea or on the East Coast of Africa. Excellent work has been and is being done by the vessels under the command of Admiral Wernyss and Admiral Oharlton. But important as these operations are, they are sub-ordinate to military considerations both in Arabip, and German East Africa.The Eirst Sea Lord and the Chief of the Staff, whom I have consulted in the preparation of this memorandum, have expressed their full agreement.A.
