November 1916.SECRET.G.-97.COMBINED STRATEGY IN CONNECTION WITH SUBMARINES.Note by the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty and the Chief of the AdmiraltyWar Staff.THE conclusion of the War Committee on the 2nd November (W.C.-81, paragraph 4), after discussion of the submarine danger with the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet, was that the protection of shipping and maintenance of our tonnage is one of the gravest questions at present confronting the AUies.It cannot escape notice that our shipowners, the public, and the House of Commons are also becoming alive to the seriousness of this menace to the merchant shipping now afloat.We are taking steps to improve the defence of our mercantile marine against submarines and wiU endeavour to help individual friendly neutral vessels to avoid them, but neither the Allies nor the neutrals can actually protect by escort even a small proportion of the sailings, and presumably the neutrals dare not arm their ships and fire on German submarines in self-defence even if they had the guns, though apparently the effect on their shipping would be beneficial.It may be definitely stated that naval resources are practically exhausted as far as fast small craft for hunting submarines are concerned, but a certain change in their distribution is being effected at the expense of the mobility of the Grand Fleet. This was, however, agreed to by the Commander-in-Chief.At first sight the submarine question appears to be one for the Admiralty and Board of Trade to deal with, not affecting the general conduct of the war so far as political military strategy is concerned. The military authorities of the Allies look to their navies and merchant shipping (more especially to those of Great Britain) to transport their troops and supplies to any selected threatre of operations, and there is no reason to suspect that in the main our exertions are not appreciated, though there may be disappointment that more is not promised. It may be fairly added that what we have promised we have fulfilled, but it must be pointed out that we shall have to be more cautious in our future promises with the increasing number and activity of the enemy submarines, and the ever-increasing demand on a gradually decreasing merchant tonnage.It does not appear, so far as is known, that the Allied military and political authorities have ever asked their naval confreres if they can assist the Allied navies in their heavy duties by any military strategical operation, and apparently the possibility of this assistance has not been present in their minds, the maritime resources available having done what has been asked them.It is therefore suggested, before any new future military operations for the spring are definitely planned, that the question be considered seriously as to whether it is not worth while shaping military strategy as far as can now be done to assist in the reduction of the submarine menace, through the destruction of as many of their home bases as is practicable.It is hoped and anticipated that the Allied Fleets wiR continue to account for a certain number of enemy submarines during the winter, but it is not anticipated this will be such a,s to seriously reduce their number; and it. is only by the destruction or capture of the enemy&apos;s main and subsidiary naval bases that the menace can be practically eliminated.[1285] &apos;
With the main strategy that has been forced on us it is evident that the German naval bases in the North Sea and Baltic cannot be at present attacked with any hope of their capture, but this does not appear, to apply with equal force to the recapture of the subsidiary but highly dangerous bases on the Belgian coast, nor to those in the Mediterranean. . Probably the destruction of the torpedo factory. and submarine buiding yard at Fiume would go far to check the depredations of the Mediterranean submarines by the destruction of their source of torpedo supply, and it might lead to the successful investment of Pola and the destruction of the Austrian fleet. With these bases in Italian hands, Cattaro could be more safely attacked, and its fall would practically clear the Western Mediterranean of these submarines now so busy in that area.As far as home waters are concerned, too much stress cannot be laid on the importance of the recapture of the Belgian ports from a naval point of view. It would release an enormous number of small craft for work in other areas, making the English Channel immune from destroyer attack and raids, and give us in turn an advanced destroyer base, which would be useful in protecting the Dutch trade.The importance of this operation has been periodically discussed between the naval and military staffs, and the decision to postpone further consideration of the matter is a sad blow to naval aspirations in those waters, for the carrying out of which many preparations had been made.The increasing danger to our supplies from the enemy&apos;s submarines has recently;&apos;, become so much more evident through their ruthless attack on neutrab shipping as to make this question one worth serious reconsideration before it is too late.(Initialled)        H.
