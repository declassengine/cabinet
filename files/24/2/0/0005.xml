SECRET. G.-51.cryfy iTHE SITUATION IN MESOPOTAMIA.Note prepared by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff by directionof the War Committee.1. THE following is the best estimate I can make of the present and prospective strength and distribution of the opposing forces in Mesopotamia: Turks.The following divisions are almost certainly all in Mesopotamia: 2nd, 26th, 45th, 51st, 52nd, and a combined division made up of the 35th and38th ^ six divisions. Strength, all ranks, auxiliary services, &amp;c.^ 50,000 men.The following may be in Mesopotamia : Two divisions from the 41st, 43rd, 44th, and 23^ = 16,000 to 20,000 men. One other division maybe following on from the west and may arrive early in February, if it has not been diverted to the Caucasus -12,000 men.Thus 50,000 men are there almost certainly, and it is possible that an additional 16,000 may be probably there now, while 12,000 more may be there early in February. I therefore estimate the maximum force the enemy would have in and around Bagdad by the 7th February at 78,000 men. The fighting strength of this force may probably not exceed 50,000 men, and a considerable portion of these consist of partially trained troops.This force might be increased early in March&apos; by three more divisions, or to a maximum of 114,000 men, and towards the end of the month by two more divisions, bringing the total up to 130,000 men (or 90,000 fighting men), if the Turkish divisions which have begun to move east are all sent to Mesopotamia and none are diverted towards Egypt or towards Erzeroum to oppose the victorious Russians. We ought shortly to obtain information as to this. At present it is only possible to say that it is highly probable that some Turkish reinforcements are on the way to the Caucasus.British Forces.

[228-1]Printed for the Committee vf Imperial Defence.   February 1916.
Russian Forces.In the area Hamadan-Kum-Tehran there are, it is believed, 1.0,000 infantry, 9,000 cavalry, 30 guns.The Hamadan column was recently engaged at Kengawer with a force of Turks who first captured, but were subsequently driven from, this place.2. From the above estimate it will be seen that the British relieving force now numbers 13,800 rifles, 2,000 sabres, and 46 guns, and that about 6,500 rifles, 850 sabres, and 28 guns are en route up the Tigris to reinforce it. Sir Percy Lake hoped that these would arrive by the 7th February, but his telegram No. 129/320/0 of the 28th January throws some doubt on this ; part of these reinforcements are marching, and the recent rains have made movement on foot difficult. General Townshend can hold out on half rations until some time after the 17th February (the. exact date is uncertain), but is not well supplied with artillery ammunition. It is possible, if the weather conditions improve, or further river transport becomes available, that the remaining reinforce-ments of 5,100 men will have reached the front by the end of February, bringing the relieving troops up to 25,400 rifles, 2,850 sabres, and 92 guns.The most satisfactory feature in the situation is the considerable reinforcement of artillery which is now on its way up the Tigris. The importance of this arm in an attack on entrenchments is well known, and while we hold Kut-el-Amara the enemy cannot use the river to supply his troops opposing the relieving force with ammunition and food. In the next fight both the number of guns and the amount of ammunition at our disposal should be greatly superior to any which the Turks can put in the field. The recent bad weather and the floods have made movement across country very difficult, and must therefore have affected the Turkish troops opposing General Aylmer more than they have our own men. Further, even if the weather improves, the numbers which the enemy can maintain below Kut-el-Amara must be limited by supply considerations as long as we can prevent him from using the river. On the other hand, it is reported by General Aylmer that the moral of some of the native regiments involved in the repulse of the 21st January has been shaken.The position now held by the Turks is some 22 miles from Kut-el-Amara, and we may expect that they will have prepared at least one more position between it and that at Es-Sinn. Whether they would make an3* prolonged stand at the latter place, which is about 7 miles from Kut-el-Amara, so long as General Townshend has artillery ammunition and is capable of any effective action, is doubtful. It is not possible in the time available to do more than has been done already to strengthen the relieving force. While, therefore, there are grounds for hoping that General Aylmer will reach Kut-el-Amara before General Townshend is compelled by starvation to surrender, it is by no means certain that this will be the case, and we must be prepared for either eventuality.3. If and when the relief has been effected, the alternatives before us will be to withdraw to the line Amarah-Nasiriyah, and there maintain an active defence, or to hold our position at Kut-el-Amara, or at some point near it, such as Ali-al-Gharbi, and thence act offensively as and when opportunity offers.At present it is still uncertain whether the enemy intends to make his main effort against Mesopotamia or against Egypt, but the indications are strongly in favour of the former.The line Amarah-Nasiriyah can probably be maintained without difficulty with the six divisions which will be available, when the three additional brigades arrive, against the largest force that the Turks can, according to our present information, bring against us. We should also be able to maintain the position at Kut-el-Amara so long as the marshes in its neighbourhood are in flood. Whether.we can hold Kut-el-Amara after the floods subside will depend upon the extent of the Turkish defeat in the fighting which leads up to the relief of General Townshend, the condition of the latter&apos;s troops, whether the^ three brigades promised by the Government of India have or have not reached Mesopotamia, and upon the effect of the recent Russian success in the Caucasus.4. The disadvantages of withdrawal from Kut-el-Amara are : (1.) The situation in Persia and Afghanistan is threatening, and may become increasingly so if we fall back again. This will increase the difficulty of defending India.
(2.) The Amir has shown signs of adopting an unfriendly attitude. The whDie policy of Afghanistan is believed to be under discussion, and some of the tribal leaders have been urging the Amir to proclaim a Jehad.(3.) A Turkish invasion of Persia in strength may result in the defeat of the weak Russian detachments in Northern Persia, and the inhabitants would then probably join the Turks. The Shah may then be induced to declare war on us. In that event the Bakhtiari tribe, who inhabit, the Persian oil-field district, would probably join our enemies. We might then lose the oil-fields.(4.) We might, therefore, find&apos; that the number of troops required to maintain our positions in India, Persia, and Mesopotamia was considerably in excess of that now set aside for the purpose.On the other hand, our position locally will be stronger on the Amarah-Nasiriyah line, and the Turks, owing to difficulties in regard to transport and distribution of supplies and ammunition will find that it will by no means be easy to attack us there in force.5. The disadvantages of maintaining the forward position at Kut-el-Amara are that the force that can be kept there will, owing to the necessity for detachments to guard the longer line of communication, and also, perhaps, to difficulties of supply, he smaller than the force which we can keep at Amara. The force at Kut-el-Amara will also be exposed to attack by larger numbers of Turks, because the nearer the latter are to Bagdad the greater the force they can supply.6. Whether to remain at Kut-el-Amara or whether to withdraw lower down the river is a question which must be decided after the conclusion of the relief operations. I would observe, however, that, by holding Kut-el-Amara, if it proves possible to do so, we may be able to carry out the defensive policy in the east laid down by the War Committee with greater economy of force than by withdrawing to some position lower clown the Tigris.. Sir Percy Lake may require more troops than are at present either with him or about to join him in order to hold Kut-el-Amara, but, even if that is so, it might be cheaper to send them than to run the risk of disturbance in Persia and Afghanistan. As pointed out in paragraph 1, no further large Turkish reinforcements are likely to reach Baghdad until the beginning of March, and it is improbable that these would be available at Kut-el-Amara before the end of that month. If the Turks move their reserves towards Mesopotamia their power to attack Egypt will be lessened, and Ave shall require fewer troops for the defence of that country. In accordance with the War Committee&apos;s decision of the 26th January, a division is being prepared in Egypt for despatch, if required, to Mesopotamia, and it will probably be a fortnight before it is ready to embark. No time will be lost, therefore, by deferring the decision as to the departure of this division for about ten days, and by that time it is possible that we may have some more definite news of the enemy&apos;s movements and intentions. A division starting from Egypt about the middle of February may be expected to reach Kut-el-Amara by the end of March.7. I attach a telegram which I have received from the Commander-in-Chief in India giving his views of the situation, and from this it will be seen that he is in general agreement with me as to the importance of holding Kut, if it is possible to do so.My estimate of the numbers which the Turks could put into the field in Mesopotamia differs from that of the Commander-in-Chief in India. The figures from India have been consistently lower than ours, and there is no means of judging which are correct.   The difference in fighting strength is not&apos;very great.In my opinion he has underestimated the difficulties which would be experienced by the Turks in maintaining a sufficiently, large force on the Lower Tigris or Euphrates to prejudice our position there. Moreover, it is hardly conceivable that news of Turkish concentrations on one or other line should fail to reach us in sufficient time to enable adequate countermeasures to be taken.Lastly, I do not agree that the moment is opportune to ask the Russians to undertake an offensive towards Khanikin.   The Russian forces in Persia are not large, and we are not in a position to help them if they get into trouble.   If the Russians were to suffer a reverse as the result of our invitation the relations between the Allied [228-1] B 2
forces in the east might be prejudiced. The most valuable assistance which the Russians can give us at the moment is to follow up their success in the neighbourhood of Erzerum.January 31, 1916. W. R. ROBERTSON, C.LG.S.From the C.-in-C, India, to the G.I.G.S.(.\To. 36369.   Secret.) January 27, 1916, 10*40 p.m.WITH reference to your telegram of 26th January, No. 12531, cypher. The following are my views on the military situation in Mesopotamia: -The Turkish strength now at and below Baghdad is estimated to be 5 divisions, possibly totalling some 32,000 effectives with about 50 guns. Another Turkish division may be at Khanikin. In view of your 12325 cypher M.O. 1 of 21st January it seems possible that the Turks may by the beginning of March be able to increase their forces in the Baghdad region to a total of 11 divisions, or about 80,000 men, with, say, 132 guns, taking 12 guns per division. By 7th February the force under Aylmer, including the garrisons of posts on the river above Amara, should number 35 battalions, 19 squadrons, and 74 guns, including 81 battalions and 28 guns now cn route up the Tigris. Three more field batteries from France are now arriving at Basra. If Townshencl be relieved by the middle of March, when we hope to have placed the three additional brigades from India in Mesopotamia, Lake should be able to concentrate a force of 45,000 rifles, 2,500 sabres, and 120 guns in his fighting line on the Tigris. But in the event of Kut falling, then this force will be reduced to 36,000 rifles, 2,500 sabres, and 86 guns. Of course the check to Aylmer on 21st January has prejudiced the prospects of relieving Townshend in time, that is, before 17th February, though I have just heard that Townshend now states that he can make his food supplies last for some time after that date. The immediate objective of the Turks is doubtless to capture Townshend&apos;s force. Whether they capture Kut or not they may subsequently decide (a) to continue operations against us; or (6) to secure Baghdad against us whilst operating against Russia with a view to penetrating into Persia.In favour of (a) : 1. With Kut in Turkish hands the Shatt-al-Hai is available from March to June as approach to Euphrates and Nasriyah, thus turning British position on Tigris above Qurna.2. British force might have to concentrate to defend Basra to avoid risk of defeat in detail.3. A British withdrawal down the Tigris below Amara opens oil-fields in South-AVest Persia to invasion, and exposes Pusht-i-Kuh, Bakhtiari, and other tribes to direct pressure.4. If successful in driving British back below Amara the Tuiks could operate in Persia practically free from anxiety as to safety of Bagh led.Against the above are : (a.) The flood season favours the defence.(6.) Summer climatic conditions favour operations into Persia and militate against those in Lower Mesopotamia.We must recognise, whatever course the Turks decide upon, we shall be unable to undertake advance on Baghdad in near future, especially as at present there is a shortage of river transport, which it is most difficult to remedy, though we are taking every possible step to this end. Should Kut fall, considerations affecting our future are: (a.) The nearer we are to Kut the greater the menace to any Turkish force usingthe Shatt-al-Hai, and the greater the moral effect of our position uponPusht-i-Kuh, Persia, and the Bakhtiari. (b.) Below Ali-al-Gharbi the above menace practically vanishes, as a sudden strokeagainst Kut is prohibited by the distance, (c.) Ali-al-Gharbi in our possession gives a flank position as regardst he routethrough &quot;Pusht-i-Kuh to Amara and the oil-fields.
The foregoing indicates in&apos;my opinion first, that Kut is the key to our position on the Tigris ; secondly, now is the time for a Russian offensive, towards Khanikin, if it can be arranged; thirdly, that if Kut be lost, then we should hold a point on the Tigris as high up the river as possible, and not lower than Ali-al-Gharbi, as our pivot of manoeuvre, until we can see whether the situation justifies a fresh advance, permits us to hold our ground, or imposes on us a further withdrawal. In the last case, it might be necessary to fall back to the line Nasriyah-Qarna-Ahwaz.Answers to your questions as regards details will be sent immediately.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE KY C. It.
