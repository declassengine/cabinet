Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   September 1916.CONFIDENTIAL. H9WAR RISK INSURANCE SCHEME: PROPOSED ADVANCE IN RATES.Note by the Admiealty.THE Board of Trade accounts show that up to -the 31st August, 1916, the total premiums received in respect of Hull insurances amounted to 11,836,869/.; losses in respect of all voyages in respect of which premiums where chargeable amount to 11,956,423/.; the losses, therefore, &quot;exceeded the premiums by 119,554/. To this deficit the Board of Trade wish to add the losses incurred in respect of ships on voyages current on the outbreak of the war.Under the agreement between the insurance associations and His Majesty&apos;s Government, the latter agreed to cover 80 per cent, of these losses without premium j in consideration of the associations continuing to insure the vessels in respect of the j remaining 20 per cent, until the expiration of the voyage. It was only in this way that a general cessation of trade at the outbreak of hostilities could be avoided. (R-einsurance Agreement between the War Risks Insurance Associations and His Majesty&apos;s Government, clause 1 (i) Supplement No. 3, &quot; Manual of Emergency Legislation,&quot; p. 415.)The losses on this account amount to :  In respect of insured vessels seized in enemy ports        .. ..      500,000In respect of insured vessels destroyed at sea   .. . * ..      569,266 1,069,266Of which the State agreed to pay 80 per cent., which amounts to 855,360Z., the balance of 214,0001. being paid by the Association. It is submitted that it is a distinct breach of the agreement quoted to charge these losses against.the fund accumulated by the payment of premiums, and which should be hypothecated solely to payment of losses on the ships in respect of which they have been paid.On the faith of this agreement His Majesty&apos;s Government appealed to the shipowners to recognise that their duty to the State is to keep their ships going wherever it is reasonably possible. The shipowners responded loyally to this appeal, and the trade of the country was kept going. .The only deficit, which ought to be recognised is the difference between the amount received as premium and the losses on those ships in respect of which premium has been paid. This amounted to 119,554Z. on the 31st August, but it is a fluctuating amount from day to day, and this figure may not represent the actual amount at any given moment. The total, however, is so small that it does not justify raising the rates, because less than one week of immunity from loss at the present rates will more than cover it, and there is no reason to anticipate greater losses as the war goes on than we have suffered in the past.The Admiralty is the only Department that can estimate the future risk. The Board of Trade has no knowledge that enables them to form any idea of what it wiU be, and if the opinion of the Admiralty is that, in view of the measures of protection now given and in contemplation of the future, the risk to British shipping will not be largely increased, then I think there is no good ground for raising the rate of the premium.There is another and more important reason for not making any change.   The best way the enemy can reaUy judge of the effect of his methods of submarine warfare is by the rate of premium charged for War Risk Insurance.   If His Majesty&apos;s Government puts up the rate he will jump to the conclusion that the ruthless sinking [1086]
of merchant vessels is beginning to cripple our ships, and he will be encouraged to fresh exertions. It will be more valuable tp him than a victory, and the whole world will be placarded with statements that at last the German submarine is getting the upper hand of British trade. It will go a long way towards neutralising the moral effect of our successes on land, and it will raise the spirits of the people in the Central Empires in a way it would be impossible to do in any other manner. It will have an extremely bad effect in neutral countries like Sweden, which are not well disposed towards us, and the effect in the United States will be great and may be very disadvantageous to us.Sir Norman Hill informs me that the damage that the enemy has been able to inflict on our oversea trade in two years of war has been at the rate of : Less than one-half of 1 per cent, per month on the value of the ships.Just over one-half of 1 per cent, on the value of the cargoes carried in the ships.The enemy are apparently at last beginning to realise the futility of their campaign against our seaborne commerce, but any advance in the Government insurance rates will put us back to where we were a year ago and enable the advocates of that campaign to push it with increased vigour.Erom the purely business point of view it is open to doubt if the proposal is sound. The area in which the German submarines and mines are effective against our ships is circumscribed, and the result of raising the Government rate may be to drive more ships to insure in the open insurance market, which is always waiting for an opportunity to undercut the Government rates. The effect would therefore be to reduce the Government receipts from premiums while increasing the risks, because the State would get the bad risks, the good ones going to the open market, and the financial stability of the whole scheme, which depends upon spreading the risks, will be endangered.It is understood that if the War Bisks Insurance Scheme is considered as a whole, that is the results of the insurance of hulls and cargoes are lumped together, there is no deficit even including the amount paid for ships on current voyages at the commencement of the war. There does not seem to be any reason why it should be divided into two entirely watertight divisions except for purely accounting purposes. The risk is the State&apos;s, and the money must eventually come out of the pocket of the State, whether it comes from one till or another. It therefore seems to be a move of more than doubtful policy to run the risk of doing incalculable military damage through raising the falling moral of our enemies for the sake of adjusting what is, after all, only a question of Departmental accounts.Admiralty, September 19, 1916.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE bt C. R. HARRISON. 27/9/16.
