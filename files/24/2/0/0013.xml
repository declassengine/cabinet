Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1916.SECRET. G -59.THE  NAVAL  SITUATION.I. Letter from Admiral Sir J. Jellicoe to the Prime Minister. II. Memorandum by Admiral Sir John Jellicoe.Note by the Secretary.THE Prime Minister has received the following letter and memorandum from Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, written after the meeting of the War Committee which he attended on the 17th February, and he has directed that it shall be circulated to the War Committee.February 25, 1916.M. P. A. H.I.Letter from Admiral Sir J. Jellicoe to the Prime Minister.Dear Mr. Asquith, E.M.S. &quot;Jron Duke&quot; February 22, 1916.SINCE the meeting last Thursday I have received the latest Admiralty forecast of the delivery of new torpedo-boat destroyers, and it is a very disheartening document. The figures which I gave to the War Council were based on the information then in my possession, but the latest document indicates still further and very serious delays, and I therefore think I ought to tell you that the situation is a great deal worse than I thought. The statement which I made to the War Council was based on the enclosed paper which I drew up, and which I forward in case it is required in reference to my statement. The new figures in regard to destroyers are given in a marginal note to paragraph 13, p. 3. You will see there that, instead of an addition of fifty-seven torpedo-boat destroyers to the Grand Fleet, as was forecasted last August, to take effect by April, the actual addition cannot be more than nineteen, and I fully expect it will not reach that number. We are running very serious risks in this matter, as I stated on Thursday last, and I am not at all easy in my mind about it.Yours sincerely,J. A. JELLICOE.P.S. I am as much concerned about the shortage of merchant ships as I am about the shortage of destroyers.J. A. J.II. Memorandum by Admiral Sir John Jellicoe.Comparative Strength of the Grand Fleet and the High Sea Fleet.In considering the comparative strength of the two fleets, one must always remember that the Germans, having the offensive, will move at their selected moment, and that at their selected moment we are certain to be at least two battleships one battle-cruiser, one cruiser, and two light-cruisers, besides two or three destroyers from [306]
each flotilla, short of our total numbers, as this is the minimum number of vessels undergoing docking and refit.2. We must also always bear in mind that the Zeppelins possessed by the Germans are a very great addition to&quot;their light-cruiser strength; in fact, given favourable weather conditions, which is, of course, what would obtain at Germany&apos;s selected moment, a Zeppelin is of infinitely greater value for scouting purposes than a light-cruiser.3. A comparison in the strength of light-cruisers of speeds exceeding 20 knots gives the Germans, in home waters, twenty-four completed, of which six or seven are regular fitted minelayers, and the whole of the remainder probably carry mines, as against our total in the Grand Fleet of twenty-three, which includes the flotilla cruisers of the flotillas based on Scapa and Rosyth, but excludes the Harwich force. If the latter is added, the total becomes twenty-eight (twenty-nine now that &quot; Arethusa&quot; is lost).4. So far as building is concerned, the Germans are known to have at least three building, all of which were laid down in 1914, and must therefore be practically complete, if they have not already joined the fleet.5. We have building a considerable number, but there is no possibility of more than five being delivered during the present year.6. There is always a great danger of the Harwich force not joining up in time for a fleet action, as the difficulty of effecting a concentration with ships so far apart as the Grand Fleet and the Harwich force in the misty weather in the Nurth Sea is very great. As a matter of fact, it is only on very rare occasions that this concentration has been effected successfully.7. When the Zeppelins are added to the light-cruiser strength of the Higli Sea Fleet, it will be seen our situation is by no means a good one. I have counted in amongst the light-cruisers attached to the High Sea Fleet all the light-cruisers that Germany has available in home waters. I do this because it is quite certain that when Germany moves, she will move with her whole force. There are no other light-cruisers available in home waters to add to our own numbers. Further, our strength is likely in the near future to be very much weakened by the trouble that is being experienced with the Yarrow boilers. One of the light-cruisers included in our strength, for instance, the &quot;Fearless&quot; is not likely to last more than a month or two longer, and her speed is already reduced to 22 knots by some of the boilers being out of action. There are other light-cruisers, such as the &quot; Yarmouth,&quot; which are getting very near the critical stage with, their boilers.8. Turning now to destroyers. Germany has now attached to the High Sea Fleet 110 boats, and the Intelligence Department of the Admiralty anticipate that two more flotillas are probably ready, which would give a total of 132 actually attached to the High Sea Fleet. In addition, there are 40 more destroyers available on the selected day, the appropriation of which is not at present known, but again, it can only be anticipated that these destroyers will be with the High Sea Fleet at the selected moment.   The grand total, therefore, becomes 172.9. The British position is as follows : We have 40 destroyers at Scapa, 20 at Rosyth, and we are supposed to have 32 at Harwich, but the Commodore (T) informs me that he can never count on more than 16, as the remainder are taken for escort duty. Our total therefore, even if we include the Harwich force which, as stated before, is always a problematical factor is only 76 less than half the German figure. From this 76 we have also to deduct for destroyers under refit at least 10. The position therefore is certainly very bad in this respect. The half flotilla leaders to the number of 5 should be added to this total number of destroyers.10. It is true that the earlier German destroyers do not compare at all in gun power with ours, but this is only true of the earlier ones, and is not true of them if, as is quite probable, their gun armament has been added to since the war began, and against this fact must be put the infinitely superior torpedo armament possessed by the whole of the German destroyers, which is practically double that of the majority of our own boats.11. The Germans are known to have built a good many destroyers since the war began, and, in my opinion, there can be very little doubt that the number under construction is very considerable, seeing that the Germans have always pinned their faith to vessels of this type.12. We also have a very large number of destroyers &quot;under construction, but the delays in that construction are so great that there is little hope of our. receiving any important addition in numbers until the summer months, and somewhat late in the summer.
13. As an instance of the delay which has taken place, the following figures may be quoted.. In August 1915 the Admiralty forecast of the destroyers to be added to the strength of the Grand Fleet, over that then possessed, was a total by January of 24 boats. The actual total at the end of January was 7. The August forecast of the additions by April was a further addition of 33 ^ boats, making a total altogether of 57. There is no possibility of the actual addition. being more, than 32 boats, and it is not likely to reach that number.*14. There are, of course, a considerable number of destroyers in home waters beyond those given as attached to the Grand Fleet, but as those that are sea-going are employed mostly on escort duty, and in western ports, there is no hope of their reaching the scene of a fleet action in time to join up with the Grand Fleet. Moreover, they have not been worked with the fleet, and would therefore not be conversant with the tactics employed.15. The next class of vessel to be considered is battle-cruisers. At present we are, of course, in overwhelming strength as compared to the Germans, that is to say we have in the Grand Fleet at this moment ten battle-cruisers as against the four German vessels of this class, but the situation will be very much changed within the next few months. The &quot;Lutzow&quot; has been undergoing trials for the last twelve months, and must be joining the fleet shortly. The &quot; Hindenberg,&quot; which was laid down in 1913, must be practically complete. The &quot; Ersatz Victoria Luise,&quot; which was laid down in 1914, must also be near completion, and it is probable that the construction of the &quot; Ersatz Freya &quot; has been hastened.16. When these four vessels join, and they are probably all of them armed with guns of 15&apos;2-inch calibre if not heavier guns, the situation will be very different from what it is now. The last four German vessels are built to have a speed of about 30 knots. At any rate, it is quite certain that their speed is very much higher than that of all our battle-cruisers, except the four vessels of the &quot; Lion &quot; class, and they are very superior in armament and also in protection to the &quot;Lion&quot; class ; they would, unquestionably, given equality in handling and fighting, be more than a match for them. Therefore, we should be in an unpleasant position of having four German vessels afloat which we are unable to tackle.17. It is a very unfortunate thing that we stopped the building of battle-cruisers after the &quot; Tiger&quot; was laid down, and turned our attention to the &quot; Queen Elizabeth&quot; class, the speed of which vessels is totally insufficient for battle-cruiser work. The only vessels which have been laid down since, whose speed is in the least equal to the German battle-cruisers, are the three vessels of the &quot; Glorious &quot; class, and the &quot; Bepulse,&quot; and one other vessel of the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; class, but these ships have practically no side armour, and are therefore quite unable to meet a battle-cruiser, and moreover, there is no probability of any of them being delivered until the autumn. Had the construction of these vessels been pushed forward, we should at any rate have been in a position of being able to drive in all the German light-cruisers, although we should not have been able to effectively tackle their battle-cruisers. As it is, we can do neither, and the Germans, with the aid of their Zeppelins, will, unquestionably, ascertain the dispositions of our battle fleet before we are able to do the same in regard to theirs. They will therefore be able to place themselves in a position of tactical advantage for the fleet action.18. It is true that we have an overwhelming superiority in vessels of the cruiser class, but unfortunately these ships are possessed of such low speed, which barely exceeds that of the battle fleet, that they are of very little use for scouting work, although they are able to prevent light-cruisers from breaking through our line.19. In regard to submarines, the delays in construction have been at least as great as in the.case of the other vessels, except that vessels built in the Royal Dockyards have been fairly well up to time.20. Here, again, the anticipated deliveries before the summer are very few in number. .21. There is one other disquieting feature in regard to all our new ships, namely, that probably owing to the conditions of construction during war time, they develop innumerable defects on joining the fleet, and an immense amount of time has to be spent by all concerned in getting these defects put to rights.22. A class of vessel which is very urgently required, and which has also been considerably delayed in construction, is the sloops. One of the main difficulties with which the fleet will have to contend when the moment for action against the High Sea* The actual addition will now bo not more than 19 by the eud of April.-J. A. J.
PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BT C. R. HARRISON.-26/2/16.Fleet arrives is that of avoiding serious losses from German mine-fields, and for this purpose a very large number of mine-sweeping vessels is required. The ideal mine-sweeping vessel for the Grand&apos;Fleet would be one which can sweep ahead of the fleet, but no such vessel has yet been designed, and therefore, we have to fall back on vessels which can be continually sweeping or searching the channels down which the Grand Fleet would move on the way south.23. This work cannot be even attempted with any degree of success without a total of at least twenty-four mine-sweeping sloops, to be attached to the Grand Fleet, and, up to the present, the number has never been more than nine, of which number there are very rarely available more than six or seven, owing to various causes, one of which is that the light structure and hurried construction of the vessels has resulted in their being constantly laid up for repairs.. 24. The mine-sweeping gunboats, which were originally the sweeping force of the Grand Fleet before war began, are now practically unseaworthy, and those which are not undergoing very considerable repairs can only work in smooth water.25. The difficulties of ensuring a fair degree of safety fcr the fleet while moving south are much enhanced by the constant bad weather during the winter months, which prevents these vessels from carrying out sweeping operations except in the vicinity of the ports for an average of probably four da)7s a week..26. The provision of an adequate number of vessels of this class is much handicapped by the diversion of a large number of them to the Mediterranean. The position in regard to fleet-sweeping vessels is actually no better than it was at the end of 1914, although other vessels are promised in the near future.J. A. JELLICOE.v
