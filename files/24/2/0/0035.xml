[-This Document is the Pr^LM^^^^S^a^IE^^IPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   October 1916.SECRET.G.-81. f     QCONDITIONS OF AN ARMISTICE.IT seems possible that, if the Allied offensive can be maintained on its present scale for another six weeks, an armistice will be proposed. President Wilson, whose&apos; recent action shows how deeply he is obsessed by electioneering ambition, will be quite readv to make such an offer, even though he anticipates a refusal, provided his party can profit thereby. He will probably make his proposal direct to us, to which we can suitably reply that, as the Allies have undertaken not to make peace in isolation, we consider that all must consent jointly to an armistice. The Pope, on the other hand, possibly in conjunction with the King of Spain, might make proposals, but they would /be conducted with greater secrecy and without ulterior motives. Finally Germany might persuade some neutral Power to open negotiations on her behalf. I rejoice that the C.I.G.S. is taking these matters into consideration.To give an unconditional refusal to an armistice would be bad policy; such a course would needlessly inflame the pro-Germans at home, distress friendly neutrals abroad, and cause a reaction in favour of high authority in Germany. An armistice should therefore be agreed to in principle, and within a few hours of receiving the proposal our reply should be transmitted.We are entitled to insist upon stringent terms. Our whole strategy has been perforce based upon the initial unpreparedness of the Allies. Now when our equipment is at length maturing, and when our economic and military forces are attaining a decisive momentum, it would be quixotic to sacrifice the advantages of our prolonged efforts.In order to guarantee the good faith of the enemy, it is suggested that the terms should be as follows : (a.) Evacuation of occupied territory. (6.) Release of all prisoners of war. (c.) Surrender of certain enemy ships.These conditions are so exacting and so difficult to achieve that they amount to a refusal to enter upon negotiations. To withdraw enemy troops within- their own frontiers would take several weeks. To return all prisoners of war would be a lengthy process, and it is doubtful if the Russian Government would receive this proposal with enthusiasm. The surrender of enemy ships presents no technical difficulty, but in many ways would be the most ignominious condition, and as such the most difficult to accept. Moreover, were Germany to withdraw to her own frontiers, we should have to advance our armies, revictual Belgium, and perhaps reopen the conflict under most unfavourable circumstances.It should be possible to outline terms which, while less onerous in their nature, would give valuable compensation for suspending our pressure. Instead of complete withdrawal, we might claim the evacuation of a large triangle between Armentieres, Oourtrai, and Tournai, of Mulhausen, of the whole position held by the Austrian right in the Trentino, of Kovel and other points on the Russian front of strategic importance at the moment of discussion, We should likewise insist that the evacuations take place within forty-eight hours or less, thus securing a mass of material for the reconstruction of our fresh line.Even these terms would be denounced as harsh and unreasonable, but at least they can be accomplished within a few days.   It is undesirable that the conditions of an armistice should be the subject of public discussion, either here, in Italy, or in the United States of America.   Promptitude is therefore essential.

The main issues are in themselves complex, but many subsidiary points will require decision, such as the maintenance of the blockade and censorship, the use of neutral ports by enemy submarines, the continuance. of aerial patrols, and the bearing of a truce upon our forces in Greece and Mesopotamia. To determine our policy will consume time, as the diplomatic formulse will have to be adjusted by telegraphic correspondence between six or eight Powers. If it be thougnt that negotiations through the Governments concerned will be too protracted, carte blanche might be given to the Diplomatic representatives at Paris to impose such terms as may command general assent.At the Peace Conference a different group of problems will arise, on which no comment is offered : all I now wish to argue is that, we should avoid the error of refusing an armistice or insisting upon terms tantamount to a refusal. A rapid and precise reply would embarrass President Wilson and prevent his personal intervention into our affairs. Terms could thus be most profitably exacted which would give us overwhelming advantages in the event of the later negotiations breaking down. In such circumstances we should be able to press our case firmly, being confident that Ave could forthwith resume hostilities with the certainty of a crushing success.C. &amp; B.September 17, 1916.
