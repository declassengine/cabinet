rPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1916.SECRET. 0-92.THE GENERAL REVIEW OF THE WAR.Memorandum by the Secretary op the War Committee.MEMORANDA have been received from the various Departments of State concerned reviewing, from their different points of view, the present situation of the Allies.* It may perhaps be useful to the War Committee to have a review from a more general standpoint, taking the departmental views into account.The Objects of the Allies and of the Enemy.2. It seems desirable that, at the commencement of a general survey, the War Committee should establish clearly in their minds what is precisely the object for which we are fighting. On the 9th November^ 1914, the Prime Minister stated at the Guildhall the object in the following terms : &quot; We shall never sheathe the sword, which we have not lightly drawn, until Belgium recovers in full measure all, and more than all, she has sacrificed; until France is adequately secured against the menace of aggression; until the rights of the smaller nationalities of Europe are placed upon an unassailable foundation; and until the military domination of Prussia is wholly and finally destroyed.&quot;On the 23rd February, 1915, in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister repeated this declaration, adding the word &quot; Serbia&quot; after &quot;Belgium.&quot;3. A number of Memoranda have recently been prepared and circulated to the War Committee, giving the views of various Cabinet Ministers and Departments on the subject of peace terms. Although these naturally differ according to the point of view from which they are written, there appears to be a general agreement on the following desiderata :-(i.) That Belgium should be freed from German occupation and control; (ii.) That the Germans should withdraw from the occupied districts of France, and that Alsace and Lorraine, or at least their French portions, should become French;(hi.) That some arrangement should be made in regard to Poland which isacceptable to Russia; (iv.) That Russia should acquire Constantinople subject to the Allies realisingtheir own desiderata in Turkey-in-Asia and elsewhere ; (v.) That Italy and Roumania should receive the territorial increases providedfor in the treaties on which their entry into the war was based; (vi.) That Serbia should be re-established.4. In addition, the Memoranda contain a number of controversial or doubtful points.. Probably the most important of these is the question raised in the Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, dated the 31st August, 1916, as to how far it is desirable to crash Germany completely, having regard to the principle of the balance of power ; and, among others, are the question of indemnities, the question of the disposal of the German Colonies and other territorial changes outside Europe (which are under consideration by Sir L. Mallefs Sub-Cpmmittee), and a whole series of other more detailed questions of varying degrees of importance.5. This is not the occasion to discuss these matters in detail, but it would seem to foljlow from the opinions that have so far been expresesd that the minimum objects* This paper was prepared before the receipt of the memoranda by Lord Crawford (G-91), Lord Curzon (G-93), and the papers by the War Trade Intelligence&apos; Department (G-90)&apos;and by &quot;Mr. Max Mutter (G-89). forwarded by Lord Robert Cecil.&apos;/[1222]B
which we hope to achieve shall inflict on Germany such humiliation that she will never again repeat the experiment of forcing Europe into war. This would seem to be as far as the War Committee, could go at present in defining the objects of the war.6. Perhaps the most noticeable point. about the desiderata which have been mentioned is that nearly the whole of the territorial objects which we consider that the Allies should attain as the result of the war, which has been forced upon us, are still in the actual occupation of the enemy.7. On the other hand, the territorial objects, which the enemy seeks to attain in the war he has forced upon us, are nearly all at this moment in his occupation. If Holland, Switzerland, a small portion of Belgium, and the portion of the Pas de Calais concerned be excepted, the pan-German^ plan, in the territorial sense, is actually realised; so is the plan of expansion in the East, and the present rulers, if not the peoples, of Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey, have been placed under an immeasurable debt of gratitude to Germany. The prospects of a German Colonial Empire and of a world-dominating sea power have alone retrograded.8. Hence, if the Allies were by any cause forced to discuss peace terms under present conditions, Germany would have in her hands all, or nearly all, that she seeks from the war in the form of territorial compensation, with something in hand to bargain with. The Allies, on the other hand, would territorially only have the German colonies.9. The Allies, however, if they lack territorial assets outside the German colonies, have other assets of an important nature. The steady squeeze of the blockade is making Germany very uncomfortable, and the Germans would perhaps give up a good deal to remove it, unless they suspected that we were at the end of our resources. Also, as the Chief of the Imperial General Staff has pointed out, the potential man-power and military resources of the Allies are far greater than those of the enemy, and in a prolonged war these are bound to tell if they can be made liquid, a matter of great difficulty.10. Notwithstanding these moral and potential advantages, it is impossible to contemplate with equanimity the prospect of a discussion of J3eace terms at any date, however remote, until the balance of advantage has inclined far more decisively than at present to the side of the Allies, and this makes it absolutely vital that our staying-power should be safeguarded.11. Probably, however, the weakest point in the cause of the Allies, is their staying-power, owing to the prodigious strain of the American orders on their financial resources. The Chancellor of the Exchequers Memorandum shows that in this respect there is grave cause for anxiety, and that, if no steps are taken to avert it, the Allies will, within the next few months, become entirely dependent upon the goodwill of the President of the United States of America for their power to continue the war.12. Hence it would seem that the most urgent problems which the War Committee have to face at the present time are : (i.) To render liquid the military resources of the Allies; (ii.) To increase the staying-power of the Allies;(iii.) To diminish the dependence of the Allies upon the United States of America.&quot;13. In order to examine these problems in greater detail it is desirable to consider the plans by &quot;which it is hoped to realise the aspirations of the Allies in this w7ar. These plans are twofold, Naval and Military.The Naval Plan.The Offensive Plan.14. In the Eirst Lord&apos;s Memorandum of the 14th October (pages 2 and 3), it is shown that the naval offensive plan is the blockade of Germany.   It is a plan of very* See the maps in &quot; Le Plan pangermaniste demasqu(5&quot; by Andre&quot; Ch^radame, a valuable contribution ;o this side of the question.
ancient date. It was conceived in 1906 when the first complete naval plans of war with Germany were drawn up. Its general intention was explained to the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1909 in the course of enquiry into the military needs of the Empire (C.I.D. Paper 109-B), and to the Dominion Premiers at the Committee of Imperial Defence by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. McKenna) on the 29th May, 1911.15. If the blockade plan has as yet proved less. decisive than some of its earlier exponents expected, it has been carried out with far greater efficiency than was ever believed possible before the war, thanks to the co-operation of the ancillary services controlled by the Minister of Blockade, the -Board of Trade, the Treasury, with its Sub-Department, the Board of Customs and Excise, and the War Trade Department. When the Declaration of London was under consideration, measures far more moderate than those now in actual application were treated as altogether beyond the pale of International Law, and were not considered seriously. In this connection also the following conclusion of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 7th January, 1913, may be recalled : &apos;&quot;In order to bring the greatest possible economic pressure upon Germany, it is essentialthat the Netherlands and Belgium should either be entirely friendly to this country, in whichcase we should limit their oversea trade, or that they should be definitely hostile, in whichcase we should extend the blockade to their ports.&quot;Every alternative had been discussed and dismissed before this conclusion was reached, and it is, therefore, interesting to note that the blockade arrangements should, under existing conditions in regard to neutral countries, have reached their present state of considerable efficiency by a process of bargaining and rationing which, before the war, was considered impossible.16. Satisfactory as this result is, and great as is the economic pressure on the enemy, there is an almost unanimous opinion that the objects of the Allies cannot be achieved by economic means alone, and that military success is essential. Mr. Max Muller, who reports on this subject monthly for the Foreign Office, goes so far as to express the view that a peace extorted by famine alone would not be the peace we aim at, and he quotes a high official engaged on blockade work as saying : &quot;I would rather feed them and beat them than starve them without beating them.&quot;* At any rate, there is no difference of opinion whatsoever that the naval offensive plan must be supplemented by the most vigorous military operations of which we are capable.The Defensive Plan.17. The naval defensive plans, with their military supplement for Home and Colonial Defence, have succeeded completely ; and it is to this that we owe the fact that the British Empire, almost alone of the nations (Allies or enemy) engaged in this war, has its territory intact up to the present time,t The question of whether the Navy could not undertake heavier responsibility for Home Defence is raised by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and is one to which the War Committee should direct its attention.The Defence of Trade.^ 18. The defence of commerce, although on the whole as successful as was anticipated before the war, is&apos; nevertheless a cause of anxiety. The Board of Trade Memorandum is eloquent on this subject, showing, as it does, a net decrease of 246 ships of 586,279 gross tons of British steamships of over 1,600 tons gross since the beginning of the war. Nearly the whole of this net loss has occurred within the last twelve months. According to the figures compiled for the War Committee in the latest monthly return, the losses of British shipping from hostile action in the first nine months of 1916 amounted to 233 ships, of 707,865 gross tons, compared with the loss in 1915 of 218 ships, of 676,750 gross tons.lpft * ^writer does not agree in either of these views. While agreeing that no means should be ere untried for mulcting military defeat on Germany, he is convinced that, if exhaustion or trouble with America or any other cause should eventually necessitate a reduction in scale of our military effort, kI. r ; i nevertheless, be attainable in the last resort by economic pressure provided that our oaustion had not gone so far as to stop our military effort altogether. The writer also believes that wrJiT? 0&quot;Smal British plan, that is to say, the triumph of the sea over the land would be avery salutary and perhaps the most salutary possible lesson to Germany.T Bulgaria is also an exception. &apos;.    &apos;
This is a result highly creditable to the Admiralty measures of protection, since it is clear that the increase in the enemy&apos;s submarine activity has not- vented itself much more successfully on British shipping in 1916 than in 1915. The reason for our considerable net Toss, as set forth in the Board of Trade, Memorandum, is less that the losses of British shipping are increasing than that we are no longer acquiring enemy shipping at a rate sufficient to recoup our losses. We must expect, therefore, that in the next twelve months the net losses will increase progressively, notwithstanding the greater activity in shipbuilding. We are, in fact, to some extent draining our capital in ships.19. Scarcely less important in the shipping situation is the heavy loss of Allied merchant ships. In the first nine months of 1916 our Allies lost from hostile action 205 ships of 532,995 gross tons, compared with 59 ships of 111,796 gross tons in the first nine months of 1915, this being due in all probability to the defective protection in the French and Italian zones in the Mediterranean. As our Allies do not build even as fast as we do, these losses are a severe drain on the shipping resources of the Allies as a whole.20. Finally, the heavy losses of neutral shipping are a serious factor to the Allies, since, as Mr. Runciman points out, we are compelled to depend more and more on neutral ships for our existence. The neutral losses for the first nine months of 1916 were 168 ships of 266,165 gross tons, compared with a loss in 1915 of 126 ships of 172,009 tons.21. The connection between these losses and the staying power of the Allies is so obvious as to need no demonstration. The First Lord of the Admiralty shows that the principal measure of security to be adopted, at any rate, for British and Allied ships, is the provision of 12-pr. or preferably 4-inch guns, of which it is understood that several thousand are required. It would seem to be a question for the War Committee to consider whether these ought not to be regarded as a matter of primary urgency to take precedence over all artillery requirements, since we might even lose the war for lack of them, in view of recent losses.^22. The First Lord also shows that the Italian section in the Mediterranean is inadequately defended, the distribution of destroyers being determined rather in accordance with political pressure put on the Government by individual deputies than by broad strategic considerations. It would seem to be a question whether the War Committee should not put strong pressure on the Italians to rectify this.23. The President of the Board of Trade also makes certain proposals for improving the shipping situation, including an understanding in regard to the supply of steel so as to safeguard merchant shipbuilding; efforts to make up the labour shortage in the shipyards and marine engine shops; the keeping of a careful watch on the movements of vessels in the service of the Allies, and the uses to which they are put; the provision by the War Office of additional battalions to supply emergency labour in our commercial docks with a view to turning ships round more expeditiously. These are all matters which it would seem ought to engage the attention of the War Committee.The Military Plan.24 As pointed out by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, our military offensive plans are based on the Conclusion of the War Committee of the 28th December, 1915, that from the point of view of the British Empire, France and Flanders are the main theatre of operations.25. There is no desire in this Paper to discuss the strategy of the war, which is a matter for the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, but it may be pertinent for the Secretary of the War Committee to point out that on the whole the results of the offensive in the West may be said to have come up to the expectations of the General Staff when this plan was decided on. An exhaustive search has been made of all the General Staffs Memoranda on this subject and of the Secretary&apos;s notes of the meetings of the War Committee when the question of the offensive was decided* Since this was written the War Committee have heard Admiral Sir John Jellicoe&apos;s disquieting views -on the subject.
on. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and his predecessor, in December 1915 and January 1916, recommended the present policy after a most exhaustive examina-tion of all alternative policies as the one best calculated to bring about the defeat of the German and Austian armies. On no occasion did they hold out hopes that a final decision would be reached in 1916. They never underrated the difficulties of the task, nor the defensive powers of the enemy, though they seem &apos;to have underrated the numbers of the enemy&apos;s reserves.&quot;There are no certainties in war,&quot; General Sir Archibald Murray wrote on the 28th December, 1915,-&quot; arid it cannot be guaranteed that the course recommended would succeed, but the General Staff feel convinced that there is no alternative worth adopting, and that the prospect of ,success, and perhaps decisive success for such an offensive are good if all the Allies agree on it.....The above is, on the whole, the most optimistic forecast that can be traced. On the 1st January General Sir &quot;William Robertson wrote : &quot; On the whole, therefore, it would seem that the prospects of future operations in France are good. At the same time, I wish it to be clearly understood that it is highly improbable that the enemy will  be   completely defeated as  the result of asingle great effort.....   This plan may therefore fail, or, at least, meet only with suchpartial success as attended our efforts last September.....   An attack which inflicted uponthe enemy losses as great as were incurred last September, would have a far greater moral effect than it did then, both upon the enemy and the nation, would, deplete their last remaining reserves, and appreciably shorten the duration of their resistance.&quot;26. Neither has the plan involved losses in excess of anticipations. The estimate given to the Cabinet Committee on the Co-ordination of Military and Financial Effort in February 1916 was for a wastage of 108,000 men a month for fifty-four divisions in the field, and 123,000 men a month for a force of sixty-two divisions in the field during the summer months. There is no reason to believe that these estimates have been exceeded.27. In order to continue to carry out this plan, and to ensure complete victory, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff shows that still greater efforts are necessary, including &quot; the utmost assistance which the Navy can give to the Army in Home Defence, so that the greatest possible number of troops may be placed in the field; we must make available for the Army all men fit for military service who can by any expedient be released; and having got the men we must place them where they can best make their weight felt; there must be no mistakes in our grand strategy. Finally, we must expect and at once prepare for harder and more protracted fighting, and a much greater strain on our general resources than any yet experienced before we can wring from the enemy that peace which we have said we mean to have.&quot;28. The most important proposal which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff makes for increasing our military effort is to release some of the divisions now retained for Home Defence, but this is only practicable if the Navy will undertake a greater measure of responsibility. In this connection it will be noted that Home Defence is incomparably better provided for than it was in the early months of the war, when it was entrusted to untried and very partially trained Territorial divisions, with very little ammunition and most inferior artillery. Moreover, Home Defence was then based on the assumption that it was adequate if it could deal with a force not exceeding 70,000 men lightly equipped with artillery and transport, whereas now the figure has been raised to 160,000 men. &apos;29. The latest pronouncement to the War Committee on Home Defence was on the 30th August, 1916, in the following terms (W.C.-64) :-&quot; The War Committee approved the following Conclusions of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff:-&quot; (a.) It is reasonable to say that at the present time the enemy cannot attempt a serious invasion of this country, because he cannot spare the necessary troops from a ^e ^ontuie:at at an7 rate unless he abandons his efforts against Verdun. (6.) Apparently he has sufficient sea transport for the conveyance of 160,000 men, and as it is impossible to say now that he will not be able to spare that number of men at some future date, we should prepare to meet them, unless the Navy can under-take to prevent them from reaching our coast. [1222] c
&quot; (c.) No material reduction can be made in the number of troops now allotted to Home Defence other than such as may be found feasible by substituting Volunteers for permanent Home Service men. &quot;The sedentary forces are largely composed of draft-finding units, and they must remain in the United Kingdom, in any case, while the general service formations of the mobile forces, in addition to forming for the time being part of the Home Defence forces, constitute a valuable, and in fact the only, strategical reserve for use when and where required abroad.&quot;Remarks.30. An endeavour has been made above to summarise the objects for which we are fighting; our present position in regard to the achievement of these objects ; and the means at the disposal of the Allies for their accomplishment.31. It has been shown that much remains to be done before we are within reach of attaining our objects; that the naval blockade plan, which makes the smallest demand on our resources, is generally agreed to be insufficient by itself, though invaluable to supplement the military plan; but that even for the maintenance of our vital sea communications more guns, and either more merchant ships or better use of our merchant ships is necessary! All this involves more men. For our military plans also a greater effort is required ; in particular, more men are required, which involves more munitions, and more munitions involves more men. More men are also required for the production of steel and coal, which latter is relied on largely as a lever in our negotiations with neutral countries in maintaining and strengthening the blockade. More men are also required for agriculture in order to reduce our dependence on imported food supplies, and for commerce and industry in order to increase our exports, both these latter being an essential element in the maintenance of our foreign exchanges, on which the whole financial power and staying power of the Allies depends. In short, our power to increase or even to continue our efforts at their present level depends on more men.32. Contrast this with the table at the end of the Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, showing an overwhelming balance of man-power on the side of the Entente Powers.33. Is it really impossible to organise so that some part of these reserves of man-power shall be devoted to the objects specified in paragraph 31 ?34. Let the War Committee consider, for example, the case of Portugal. We are actually encouraging the despatch of Portuguese troops to fight alongside British armies, probably on the Western Front. It is not likely that the Portuguese soldier has much enthusiasm for this particular fight, and no one feels any confidence in his fighting powers. The Portuguese troops add to the burden on the resources of the Allies in so much as they require arms, equipment, munitions, supplies, and ships. Would it not be far better to employ Portuguese labour in our ports and in other civil occupations for which they are admirably fitted ? In the years before the war from 50,000 to 60,000 Portuguese emigrated from their native country every year, largely, it is believed, to Brazil. Cannot this tide of emigration be diverted to this country for the purposes of the war alone and under carefully guarded restrictions ? To anyone not closely acquainted with the difficulties of trades unionism and other political considerations this remedy to our man-power difficulty would seem so obvious as to need no demonstration. When so many difficult social problems have been overcome, is this one insurmountable ?35. Is it not worth consideration whether a few thousands of the Russian reserves, amounting to 6^- million men, could be spared for agriculture in this country, seeing that Russian prisoners are doing a large part of Hie agriculture for the enemy? The use of Italians, whorare among the best underground workers in the world, and made most of the tunnels in Switzerland, and, it is believed, some of the tube excavations in this country has, it is understood, already been considered and rejected.Summary. .36. The following is a summary of the constructive points arising from the various memoranda presented to the War Committee which seem to require con-sideration: 
(i.) The possibility of reducing the number of divisions allotted for Home Defence and placing greater reliance on the Navy. (Paragraphs 27-29.) (ii.) The question of providing for a more rapid output of 4-inch or other suitable guns to be mounted on board merchant ships. (Paragraph 22.) (iii.) The question of putting pressure on Italy to make a better strategical disposition of her naval forces for the purpose of dealing with submarines. (Paragraph 22.)(iv.) To promote a definite understanding in regard to supplies of steel with the object of safeguarding merchant shipbuilding.   (Paragraph 23.)(v.) To stimulate the efforts for making up the labour shortage in shipbuilding and marine engine shops.   (Paragraph 23.)(vi.) To arrange who is to be responsible for watching the movements of merchant vessels in the service of the Allies and the uses to which they are put. (Paragraph 23.) (vii.) To consider the possibility of allocating some of the Home Defence battalions to supply emergency labour in the docks with the object of turning ships round more rapidly. (Paragraph 23.) (viii.) The question of the utilisation of foreign labour in this country with the object of lessening the dependence on foreign supplies which, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer points out, will before long place us at the mercy of the President of the United States of America.
