SECRET.G-80. 20THE EMPLOYMENT OF PRISONERS OF WAR.Memorandum by the Adjutant-General.(Prepared in accordance with Conclusion I of War Committee Paper W.C.-67, datedSeptember 12, 1916.)- THE question of employing prisoners of war in this country is rather different to employing them in France, the area of the latter being much larger than this country; and, further, it is not so densely populated, 193 inhabitants to the square mile as against 374 in this country ; also their most thickly populated country in the north-east is in possession of the enemy. This enables them to put their prisoners out on the land more than we can do, as they have more space.Another thing against employing German prisoners in this country in small parties is the feeling of the people against Germans. The atrocities in Belgium at the commencement of the war, submarine outrages, particularly the &quot; Lusitani^,&quot; and Zeppelin raids have all acted against such employment.. To illustrate this, it is only a few weeks ago that the chief constable of Liverpool reported that he was afraid of the consequences if we kept German wounded in a hospital at Liverpool, owing to the local feeling against them occasioned by the sinking of the &quot;Lusitania,&quot; and the wounded were removed. Another thing that has to be contended with is the Labour Party. A short time ago proposals were made for employing the prisoners at the docks in London, but this had to be dropped on account of the feeling of the Labour Party.Until quite recently no scheme had been put forward for employing these prisoners on any large scale, and the Prisoners of War Department had been dealing with applications for small parties put forward by the Ministry of Munitions, Home Grown Timber Committee, and private individuals.There is now a Committee in formation to deal with the employment of prisoners on land reclamation, and it is suggested that this Committee should deal with all other questions for employing these prisoners on works of national importance such as making new roads, repair of existing old roads that may have fallen into disuse and which may be useful to the country if repaired.By this means it is hoped large numbers would be employed next spring, and this Office would only be concerned in providing the prisoners, housing, and feeding, and guarding them.At present there are interned in the United Kingdom 19,722 combatant prisoners of war, naval and military. Of these 2,028 are in hospital, leaving 17,694 available for work.Of these there are bound to be a certain number not suitable for manual labour for various reasons.The numbers on various work are in&apos; (A) attached, and a further 1,500 are employed temporarily near Aldershot in making a road for a railway from Bisley to Blackdown. This gives a total of 5,332 at work, and in addition applications have been received for a further 2,000.In addition to those shown on (A) there are a certain number employed in the various camps on mailbag making, bootmaking, tailoring, &amp;c, and on works in the vicinity of the camps.There are in France 2,944 employed on the docks at Havre and Rouen, who were sent from England, and 5,153 in working companies on&apos; the lines of com-[1090] - -, - - iPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.

munication, making a total of 8,097 in France. These numbers employed on the lines of communication increase as prisoners are captured at the front.These prisoners of war on the lines of communication are entirely at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief in France, and the War Office are not concerned in their employment beyond laying down general principles required by the Hague Convention.In regard to work by prisoners of war in the United Kingdom the great difficulty experienced has been the number of men required to guard these comparatively small parties particularly those employed on timber felling. For instance, in the case of a party of 135 prisoners of war the authorities on the spot asked for a guard of 70 men. The larger the party the more economical is the work so long as accommodation is available.Volunteers (V.T.C.) were asked to provide guards in Scotland, but were unable to do so. The question of their providing them in London for Alexandra Palace is being considered.The Employment Bureau of the Board of Trade have been trying to get work for small parties and individuals. They have confined their efforts so far to civilian aliens, and I understand have had about 30 applications so far.One case they forwarded to this Office, and it has been forwarded to the Command concerned to carry out, if feasible, and the civilians will undertake the work.(Initialled)        C.
