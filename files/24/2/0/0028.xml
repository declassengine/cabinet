Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1916.SECRET, :.G.-74;THE PRESENTATION TO PARLIAMENT OF PAPERS IN REGARD TO THE MILITARY OPERATIONS IN MESOPOTAMIA AND THE DARDANELLES.iI. Note by the Secretary.II.-Note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.Appkndix.-Extract from the Official Report of the Parliamentary Debates, -        June 1. 1916. - t[        ;    jI. Note by the Secretary.THE Prime Minister desires that the War Committee shall consider the question of the presentation to&apos; Parliament of Papers relating to the military campaigns in Mesopotamia and the Dardanelles. This Memorandum has been prepared to give the Committee full information as to how these questions stand.&quot;Mesopotamia.2. The first promise to produce Papers on the subject of Mesopotamia was made by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government, voluntarily and not under any pressure, in the course of a statement On compulsory military service made in the House of Commons on the 2nd May, immediately after the fall of Kut. The actual reference in the Official Report of the Parliamentary Debates is as follows : &quot; At another moment it is told as I feel sure it will be said when the papers about Mesopotamia which toe are about to produce are circulated, that the Government was the too subservient tool of their military advisers.&quot;On the following day Lord Crewe in the House of Lords stated in reply to a question by Lord Morley that some papers would be laid before the House as soon as possible in regard to General Townshend&apos;s appreciation of the position after the battle of Kut-el-Amara, and in a supplementary answer he agreed :  -&quot; That the public were entitled to the fullest information that could be given consistently with the necessity of. safeguarding military operations, but he could not say precisely when the Papers would be ready.&quot;On the llbh May, the Prime Minister stated that : &quot; As some time must elapse before the Papers dealing with the expedition as a whole can be laid, it is proposed to lay Papers dealing with this special point (namely, General Townshend&apos;s appreciation of Ihe position-after the battle of Kut-el-Amara) separately, and I hope very soon.&quot; ......3. These latter Papers were laid on the 30tb May. On the 1st June, on the Motion for the adjournment, the precedent of the publication of the Mesopotamian Papers was urged as a reason &quot;for publishing the Dardanelles Papers, Sir H. Dalziel said: &quot; For if it is right and I am sure that it is to publish Papers with regard to Mesopo-tamia, surely also it is right that the Papers with. regard to the Dardanelles ought to be published. Indeed, I think sorfar as the Dardanelles-is concerned, that case is much&apos; stronger than that of Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia is, after all, still in what you might call the active military zone, and conceivably it might be pleaded that, in-that case the-enemy should not have any information at all.&quot; .&quot;&quot; -.   &apos;[810] B
4. In replying for the Government, the Secretary of State for the Colonies said in regard to the Mesopotamian Papers : &quot; We quite realise that in publishing those papers in regard to Mesopotamia we were taking a step which is open to criticism, but we came to that conclusion, and I think rightly, for I have not changed the view that I have always held since the war began, that&apos;the public and the House of Commons should be given all the information which can by any possibility be issued without detriment to the military service. We, therefore, carefully considered the question of these Papers, and decided that, though operations are still going on in this case, yet in regard to this particular phase of them, which is finished, Papers could be laid without i     detriment to the interests of the public service.&quot;Mr. Bonar Law also promised a discussion on the Mesopotamian Expedition if there &quot;was a desire for it on the part of the House.5. On the 21st June the Under-Secretary of State for India (Lord Islington) lexplained that the Papers regarding the opinions of Generals in the field as to the jCtesiphon episode had been issued in advance, as the Government knew that the preparation of the mass of Papers and correspondence in connection with the Mesopo-tamian campaign would take a long time.Lord Midleton, on that occasion, gave the following reasons for the production of the Papers: &quot; I would only add that I press for their production, because, in the interests of the Government, I think it necessary to say that the continued reports we are receiving as individuals from Mesopotamia, showing that even now there appear to be great gaps to be filled up in preparedness, and points which show that some of those responsible for the provision of the troops have not yet risen to the full measure of their responsibility, make it highly desirable that there should not merely be a debate, but that there should be a full enquiry upon this question at the earliest possible moment.&quot;6. The above extracts from the proceedings in Parliament have been given in order to enable the War Committee to judge as to the reasons urged for the publication of the Mesopotamian Papers, as to their scope, and as to the extent to which the Government were pressed by Parliament on the subject.7. The preparation of the Mesopotamian Papers was undertaken in the India Office, and copies of the Papers when ready were sent to the Admiralty, War Office, and Foreign Office.8. The Admiralty and Foreign Office were not very much concerned depart-mentally, but the War Office replied with the following strong protest against their publication: &quot; Sir, War Office, S. IT&apos;., June 29, 1916.&quot; I am commanded by the Army Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter (unnumbered and undated), enclosing a proof of the Papers relating to the operations in Mesopotamia which it is proposed to lay before Parliament, and to state for the information of Mr. Secretary Chamberlain that, after careful consideration, the Council find themselves strongly opposed to their publication. The Papers contain many indications as to the military problems which have still to be faced, notably the difficulties of navigation of the Tigris and of maintaining a force far up that river, the protection of the oil-fields and pipe line, and the question of the isolated garrison at Nasiriyeh.&quot; I am to return the proof of the Papers with those portions marked in blue which, on purely military grounds, it will be most objectionable to publish at the present time; but even from the remainder the Council are of opinion that an astute enemy, reading between the lines, could obtain much information which would be of value to him. They therefore desire to urge that the publication of the Papers would involve serious military disadvantage, and that their publication should, therefore, be withheld; it being stated, if thought desirable, that, in the opinion of the Imperial General Staff, publication would prejudice the success of operations in Mesopotamia.&quot; I am, &amp;c,&quot;(Signed)     E. H. Brade.&quot; The Under-Secretary of State,&quot;Military Department, India Office, S.W.&quot;9. The Secretary of State for India has forwarded to the Prime Minister his comments on the passages marked in blue by the General Staff, and his remarks illustrate the difficulty of publication. On some of the marked passages (No. 200 and No. 201, for example), Mr. Chamberlain has commented that they are necessary if the story is to be fairly told.   This is precisely the difficulty, that the story cannot be told.
fully and. fairly without assisting the enemy. Even if the War Office were willing to agree to publication of Papers with the omission of the marked passages (which they are not), it is open to question whether to publish only a part of the story is not calculated to do more harm than good, as some persons are certain to consider them-selves aggrieved by omissions.10. The new factors introduced since the decision of the Government to publish these Papers are the death of Lord Kitchener, which is perhaps less important in connection with the Mesopotamian than with the Dardanelles Papers, and the retire-ment of General BaratofTs Russian force from their positions on the border of Mesopotamia.Dardanelles.11. The publication of the Dardanelles Papers differs from that of the Mesopotamian Papers in this respect; that whereas the promise in regard to the Mesopotamian was spontaneous on the part of the Government, in regard to the Dardanelles it was made under pressure and after it had been previously refused.12. Even before the evacuation, the Dardanelles papers had been asked for in Parliament and were refused, on grounds which were stated by Mr. Tennant in the House of Commons, on the 15th November as follows: &quot; The reason why we are not able to lay Papers about the Dardanelles is because it would involve arguments in relation to policy covering the whole of our campaign over the world. It is precisely because we do not treat the Dardanelles, or any part of the operations in the field, as isolated operations, or treat them in watertight compartments, that we are not able to accede to the. request to lay Papers on this subject on the Table of the House.&quot;The difficulty mentioned by Mr. Tennant is proving a most formidable one, and will be referred to later in this Memorandum.13. After inquiry into the Suvla Bay operations had been refused several times, another demand for publication of the Dardanelles Papers was made in the House of Commons in the debate on the Motion for Adjournment on the 1st June. The reasons for the demand and the scope of the ground which they desired should be covered by the proposed Papers are given in the statements by Sir H. Dalziel and Colonel Churchill, printed in full in the Appendix.1 4. It will be seen that the publication of the Mesopotamian Papers was at once seized upon by both these members as a precedent for publishing the Dardanelles Papers. It was urged that though there might perhaps have been some case for keeping back the Mesopotamian Papers, since Mesopotamia was still an active military zone, the Dardanelles campaign was a closed book, and that nothing could be published now in regard to them which could give the enemy any useful information.15. Regarding the scope of the Papers, it will be noticed that Colonel Churchill urged with considerable force that events such as the Battle of Suvla Bay could not be considered by a mere investigation of what befell the soldiers and generals on the spot, and that it was necessary to deal with these questions also from the point of view of the great decisions taken by the War Committee in Whitehall in regard to both the naval and military operations which governed the Dardanelles and Gallipoli enterprises. Sir H. Dalziel also hinted that the House of Commons would expect Papers which would clear up the question of the original naval attack and the first landing, and the time that elapsed between them.16. The Secretary of State for the Colonies granted the request for the publication of.Dardanelles Papers in the following terms : &quot; In regard to the Dardanelles and the publication of the Papers, what is the principle which should guide the Government in a matter of this kind ? In the first place, what is the object of going into this, and what is to be gained by going into it? My right honourable friend puts one consideration to me, the importance of which I need not say I do not under-estimate. He says that the publication of these Papers may probably show that there are people still exercising authority who may perhaps be proved to have made such mistakes that they should no longer be allowed to hold positions of authority. If that is true, the sooner the Papers are published the better. In regard to the Dardanelles, as in regard to Mesopotamia, the Government have come to the conclusion that it is better, on the whole, that the^ Papers should be published, and that the House of Commons should be given information. That being so, I need not say that it is the desire and intention of the Govern-ment to lay the papers on the Table as soon as possible. It is quite obvious that, if a story is to be told, then the whole of it should be told. There are only two limitations which I shall make in regard to the publication of these Papers. There may be documents of so confidential a character that they ought not to be published, and the other is, as I am sure the House will realise, that there &quot;is at least the possibility that some of the Papers might give
information which might be useful to the enemy in regard to operations which are still going on. All I can say, therefore, is that these two considerations will be kept in view by the Government, but their intention is that nothing shall be withheld which is not against public interests.&quot;In reply to a question by Mr. Outhwaite, Mr. Bonar Law promised that if there were any relevant diplomatic correspondence it would certainly be considered as well.It is understood that neither the Foreign Office, War Office, nor Admiralty were consulted before the decision in regard to the publication of these Papers was taken.17. The Prime Minister has directed the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence to act as a co-ordinating centre as regards the collection of the Dardanelles Papers. As soon as his instructions were received a communication was sent to the Foreign Office, Admiralty, and War Office, asking that each of these Departments would make its own collection and forward them to the Committee of Imperial Defence, where they would be arranged in the most convenient order.18. The Foreign Office have notified the Secretary that all diplomatic documents must be excluded. They concern the Allies, and they could not, in the opinion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, be laid without reference to them. The Allies, he considers, would certainly not consent to publication. It might be added that the diplomatic documents would very closely concern certain neutrals, such as Roumania, publication of the references to whom would be inexpedient.19. However this may be, the decision of the Foreign Office immensely adds to the difficulty of making a suitable collection. Not only does it involve the consequence that every naval and military paper will have to be most carefully scrutinised to see that it contains no reference to diplomatic events (and such references are frequent throughout the whole series), but it removes the whole diplomatic background, without which the decisions taken by the Government at the time cannot be understood. It is as impossible to separate the various phases of the Dardanelles episode from the diplomatic history of that period, as it would be to separate from diplomatic considera-tions the present retention of the Allied forces at Salonica. In fact, the Foreign Office decision renders it impossible to carry out Mr, Bonar Law&apos;s proposal that &quot; if a story is to be told, then the whole of it should be told.&quot;20. The Admiralty have received from Colonel Churchill a set of the Papers which he considers ought to be published in regard to the naval attack on the Dardanelles. These Papers include a considerable number of staff memoranda, besides private telegrams which passed between Colonel Churchill when he was First Lord of the Admiralty and the Vice-Admiral commanding the Dardanelles, and memoranda prepared by Colonel Churchill for the Cabinet, It is understood that the selection of the Naval Papers, which are very voluminous, involves decisions of considerable difficulty, which in many cases will have eventually to be made by senior officers, whose whole time is absorbed in the conduct of the war. The Flag Officer who was designated to deal with these Papers in the first instance has unfortunately broken down in health.21. It is understood that the War Office have made some progress in the preparation of their lists of Papers. General Sir Ian Hamilton has sent them a complete list of all his telegrams and despatches, and asks that the whole may be published. The Papers have, however, as yet, hot been examined by the General Staff 1  .22. One very important question of principle has been raised in connection with these Dardanelles Papers. Mr. Churchill has urged on the Prime Minister that it is necessary to publish, in some form or another, the Secretary&apos;s notes of the meetings of the War Council which existed from November 1914 until the present Government took office, when it was superseded by the Dardanelles Committee, afterwards renamed the War Committee. It is probably true that the story of the Dardanelles operations cannot be told completely without these Minutes. On the other hand, there are a large number of objections to their publication.23. In the first place, there is the question of principle. The War Committee is practically a Committee of the Cabinet, and the question arises whether its proceedings ought not to be as inviolable as those of the Cabinet. There is no precedent for the publication of the proceedings even of the Committee of Imperial Defence.24. Apart, however, from the question of principle there are objections of detail. The first of these is that it would provide a precedent for the publication of all future proceedings of the War Committee, and this might tend to stifle free discussion at future meetings, and so limit the Committees usefulness.25. A second objection is that mentioned by Mr. Tennant (see paragraph 12) that
the Dardanelles operations did not stand alone. They were part of the general strategy of the Allies, and consequently the records of the War Council, Dardanelles Committee, and War Committee in regard to them are in places inextricably bound up with other naval and military operations, and with diplomatic negotiations, in both of which our Allies were often concerned as much as ourselves. In many cases the circumstances discussed could not be published without the consent of our Allies, and often not without detriment to public interest. To endeavour to edit the proceedings by the excision of all matter that cannot be published would be to deprive them at times of all coherence and continuity.26. Another objection to the publication of these proceedings is that they are kept in the form of a summary of what each person said. For reasons of secrecy in a document concerned with the details of forthcoming naval and military operations, they have never been printed, and, consequently, they have never been passed round to be checked by members. Before they could be published it would be only fair that such opportunity should be given, though Lord Kitchener&apos;s death renders it impossible in his case, and it would be a serious responsibility for anyone to have to undertake the task on his behalf.27. ihe objections to publication of the minutes in extenso being so strong, the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence, by the Prime Ministers directions, endeavoured to prepare a memorandum based on the proceedings of the War Council. Though very great pains have been taken in the preparation of a specimen memorandum covering the first four months of 1915, it must be frankly admitted that the document produced is not in the least degree suited for publication.28. A difficulty of a different order met with in preparing these Papers is illustrated by the following letter from Lord Fisher to the Prime Minister, which is a good example of the sort of personal complications that will arise through their publication : &quot; My dear Prime Minister, &quot; 36, Berkeley Square London, June 2, 1916.&quot; I see in &apos; The Times &apos; of this morning that the Government have undertaken to. publish Papers about the Dardanelles and Gallipoli operations. I have no objection in principle to such a publication provided the Papers give a fair representation of the facts, and I presume I shall be consulted as to any selection that may be made.&quot;Certain striking facts must be incorporated in these published Papers that do not of course appear in the written records, but nevertheless they are vital and verifiable by the participants in the drama, Such, for instance, as my abruptly rising from the War Council table at No. 10, Downing Street, and going to the window, determined to terminate my service at the Admiralty, and Lord Kitchener followiug me to the window with his professional remonstrance, appealing to me to continue and carry through the Dardanelles operation, which reluctantly caused me to resume my seat! There are also other vital incidents not recorded in -writing, such as the visit of Mr. Churchill and myself to Lord Kitchener at the War Office respecting the urgency of the military steps imperative to be taken. Again, the fact must be brought out that Admiral de Robeck&apos;s telegrams of the 23rd March and the 2(5th March, recommending a. joint military and naval operation, was the determining factor that absolutely decided my final stand against further naval action alone.&quot;Again, the attitude of Mr. Balfour and Admiral Sir Henry Jackson require to be recorded, as their influence was a most important factor in the decision which led to the Dardanelles operations. Mr. Balfour&apos;s Memorandum of the 29th February, 1915, and Sir H. Jackson&apos;s detailed plan of attack should, (it seems to me) certainly be included. I have re-read my Memorandum on General Naval Policy which I sent you on the 25th January, 1915, and Mr. Churchilfs remarks thereon dated the 27th January,*in consequence of which, we had the interview with you at which your decision in favour of the Dardanelles operations was given there is a serious objection to the publication of these two documents because of the light they throw on our naval position and policy, therefore it may be sufficient (so far as I am concerned) to insert the following paragraph embodying briefly the main purport of the paper: &quot;No.    .&quot;/Memorandum by Lord Fisher on General Naval Policy deprecating the use of Naval Force in Coast Operations unsupported by Military Force, and emphasising the supreme importance of maintaining the unchallengable strength of the Grand Fleet in the decisive theatre.&apos; .&quot; Yours truly,&quot; Fisher.&quot; 2.6.16.&quot;29. The most important new factors in the situation affecting the publication of the Dardanelles Papers since the Government promise was made are : the refusal of the Foreign Office to publish the relevant diplomatic correspondence; the death of Lord. Kitchener; and the Russian offensive and its reaction on tendencies in the Balkans [810]    &apos; C
Remarks.30. It is understood that there is no precedent for the publication during the war of Papers (other than despatches) relating to a naval or military expedition, with the sole exception of the Expedition to the Scheldt, 1809, regarding which Papers were published in January 1810.*31. In regard both to the Mesopotamian and Dardanelles operations, it must be borne in mind that the presentation of Papers, if they are to tell the whole story as Mr. Bonar Law said they should do, involves certain disadvantages, amongst which the following may be cited : (a.) The Mesopotamian Papers contain information bearing on problems still to be faced, and their publication would, in the opinion of the General Staff, prejudice the success of operations in Mesopotamia.(o.) Both sets of Papers would throw a flood of light upon our general policy in the East.(c.) The enemy would obtain an extraordinarily close knowledge of our Intelligence Services in the East at different phases of the campaign, which, in the aggregate, should give him an intimate acquaintance with their value; it is only necessary to glance through the Mesopotamian collection to realise this.(d.) The enemy might be able to discover a good deal of information as to his own weak points, for example, in regard to the coast defences at the Dardanelles.-(e.) A good of information would be given to Foreign Intelligence Departments, including those of the enemy, in regard to such matters as landing places, wells, water supply, state of rivers, &amp;c, the collection of which in ordinary circumstances is an arduous and expensive task.(/.) The enemy wdll be reassured from the fact of the publication of these Papers that there is no risk of a renewed attack on the Dardanelles, and will be able to base his military dispositions on this assumption. It may be true that all prospect of attack in this region has disappeared, but the question . arises whether it is wise to tell him so.32. The questions which the War Committee have to decide appear to be as follows(i.) In the case of the Mesopotamian Papers do the political advantages of publication outweigh the &quot;serious military disadvantage&quot; which the General Staff state is involved.(ii.) In regard to the Dardanelles Papers, the Committee will no doubt be advised by the Admiralty and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff whether serious naval and military disadvantage is or is not involved in publication. It will then be for them to decide whether in this case the political advantages of publication do or do not outweigh any naval or military disadvantages.(iii.) A further question to be decided in regard to the Dardanelles Papers is whether justice can be done to anyone without the publication of the diplomatic correspondence, which the Foreign Office state they are unable to have published. Unquestionably, without these papers it is impossible to tell &quot; the whole story.&quot;* The precedent is not a happy one. The publication of the Walcheren Papers led immediately to debates in Parliament which lasted without intermission from the end of January to March 17, &quot;absorbing thus,&quot; as Alison says, &quot; nearly the whole time both of the Government and of the country at the very moment when the concentration of all the national thought and energies was required for the prosecution of the gigantic campaign in progress on the Continent.&quot; The Government escaped defeat by a small majority, but to quote Alison once more, &apos;* the obloquy which it brought upon the Government, and the narrow escape which they made from total shipwreck on its result, roused into a flame the ill-smothered embers of a con-flagration in the Cabinet, and led at this critical moment to a change in the most important offices of the State.&quot;The whole incident, which is related in considerable detail in Alisou&apos;s &quot; History of Europe,&quot; chapter LX, culminating as it did in the duel between Castlereagh and Canning, and the fall of the Portland Government, offers so&apos; many parallels to the Dardanelles campaign, both from a military and political- point of view as to be worthy of study. It may be remarked that about this time the Duke of Wellington was constantly complaining of the amount of information useful to the enemy which the British Government allowed to be published, and that the French records express the value of this information&quot; to them, though this does not apply specifically to the Walcheren expedition.
(iv.) If it is decided to publish the Dardanelles Papers a decision will be required as to whether the related War Committee proceedings are to be published, (v.) If these Papers are to be published it will also have to be decided whether they are to include such documents as Papers circulated by Ministers for the use of the Cabinet or War Committee only (as suggested by Colonel Churchill) and Staff Memoranda prepared in the Admiralty and General Staff.M. P. A. HANKEY, Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 8, 1916.II. Note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.I am strongly opposed to the publication at the present time of any papers dealing with the Dardanelles operations, for the following reasons :-1. Publication would call attention to a story ^which brings little credit to our methods of conducting war. It would, I am convinced, affect disadvantageously our prestige in the East, where moral-factors have more than ordinary weight; and this at a time when we are beginning to reassert our influence.2. It would not be possible to publish the whole of the documents and telegrams dealing with&apos; any one stage of the operations without disclosing the history of our negotiations with the various Balkan States, which would be most undesirable.3. It would not be just to publish only a portion of the documents in question, and if a complete presentment of the case is to be made, Mr. Winston ChurchilPs Apprecia-tions of the 25th February, 1915, and of the 1st June, 1915, and Lord Kitchener&apos;s Memoranda of the 14th May, 1915, and of the 28th May, 1915, amongst others, must appear. I would urge that on military grounds alone the publication of these documents during the course of the war would be most objectionable.4. Mr. Winston Churchilfs record[and reputation are not the only ones involved in these operations, and if his case is to be put forward those of Sir Ian Hamilton and of other commanders should, in justice, also be published. This would involve the appearance of a large number bf documents, which would give information to our enemies and lower our reputation in the eyes of the world.5. On the above grounds, I urge that no further action should be taken in this matter until after the conclusion of the war.(Initialled)      W. R. R., General,Chief of the Imperial General Staff.War Office, July 9, 1916.APPENDIX.Extracts from the Official Report of Parliamentary Debates, June 1, 1916.SIR H. DALZIEL : There are one or two points to which I desire to refer before the House adjourns. The first is Mesopotamia. I am glad that the Government have published voluntarily the Papers with regard to that expedition. I understand that there are more important Papers to be forthcoming, and I refer to the matter now simply to ask the Government if they will give us an opportunity of discussing those Papers and the whole situation with regard to Mesopotamia as early as possible after the House reassembles. I think that that is a very reasonable and wise demand. We have an enquiry in regard to medical arrangements, but I do not assume that we shall have the report in time for that Debate. I am sure that the Colonial Secretary, who is now leading the House, will recognise that we: are not putting forward an unreasonable demand in asking thafwe should have an opportunity of discussing a matter of so much military and public interest at the present time. I would ask further that the Government should reconsider their decision with regard to the publication of the Dardanelles Papers, for if it is right and I am sure that it is to publish Papers Avith regard to Mesopotamia, surely also it is right that, the Papers with regard to the Dardanelles ought.also to be published. Indeed, I think that so far as the Dardanelles is concerned, that case is-much stronger than that of Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia is, after all, still in what you might call the active military ^one, and conceivably it might be pleaded that in that case the enemy should not have any information at all. But the Dardanelles is a closed book. Nothing can be published now which can give the enemy any information. [810] &quot; D
whatever of military value. Therefore, the Government should reconsider their decision and give us all the Papers of value in order that we might come to a right decision with regard to the whole mystery of the Dardanelles.T am not going to re-open the Dardanelles controversy to-day, but there are two schools of thought. One thinks that the Navy was principally to blame, and the other thinks that the military did not act sufficiently and promptly in supplying the forces necessaiy to back up the Navy. My right honourable fiiend. the late First Lord of the Admiralty (Colonel Churchill), has referred in this House to some of these documents. Conceivably the reputation of statesmen may be damaged by the publication of these documents. I am not sure what view my right honourable friend takes with regard to it. lean assure him that the public are anxious to know the truth, irrespective of what the result might be. There is also the further question of the Suvla Bay operations. We all know the tragedy in connection with that in a few hours men dying for want of water because there were no guns to assist them. That ought to be the subject of information to the House and the subject of enquiry. A further point is the long delay of the Government in coming to a decision in order to evacuate that place, when, as we know, they were losing about 1,000 men a day. The Government have promised a full enquiry with regard to it. but say that lhat can only come after the wai\ We know how much importance to attach to enquiries after wars, and how long Royal Commissions drag out their proceedings. The importance of the matter is that men who were to blame in the Dardanelles may be to-day in charge of the lives of men when they ought not to be, and that they ought to face an enquiry with regard to the matter. There are two demands : that Papers should be published, and that an enquiry should, if possible, take place while the men are available. There are many of them available in London at the present time, elderly men, some of them, who might not be available after the war. I hope that my right honourable friend the Colonial Secretary will be good enough to tell us whether we may hope that the Government will reconsider their former decision with regard to that matter.******COLONEL CHURCHILL: My right honourable friend the Member for Kirkcaldy gave me to understand some time ago that he intended to press for the publication of the documents in relation to the naval and military operations at the Dardanelles and Gallipoli, and 1 therefore had time to consider the matter myself. In these matters the decision is clearly one which must rest with the executive Government. They are responsible for carrying on the war, and the publication of documents relating to past affairs, however important to individuals, must be subordinated in importance to anything which affects prospective railitary or naval operations. Put it does seem to me that the publication of the Mesopotamian Papers has made a breach of the rule which the Government has hitherto followed in regard to the publication of documents, and I have noticed that in regard to the military operations at Gallipoli attention has been very largely concentrated upon the question of Suvla Bay and the tactics of the various generals concerned. And we have had speeches and requests for an enquiry or for a publication of all documents with regard to that. The battle of Suvla Bay and the action of the generals on the spot were all preceded at the stage in this affair when the main factors were governed by the decisions which had been previously taken in London, and no mere investigation of what befell the soldiers and generals on the spot would be just or fair to them or give a true appreciation of the facts to the public. Great decisions both in regard to the naval and military operations which governed the Dardanelles and Gallipoli enterprises were taken here in Whitehall and examined by the War Committee, and it does seem to me that it would be very injurious to the reputation of Ministers, if it could be thought, or represented, that they were in some way trying, by delaying the publication of the Papers, to shield themselves, and to allow the whole burden of blame to fall upon the military or naval commanders at the scene of action. I say that the responsibility rests with the head of the Government, but, so far aB I am concerned, I say to the right honourable gentleman who is representing the Prime Minister, publish everything; I make absolutely no stipulation of any kind, whether in regard to the military or naval operations. Publish everything that the public interests allows you to publish, and I am quite sure that that course is one which, if it is taken, will enable Ministers to free themselves altogether from the charge of being anxious to leave an undue burden upon General Sir Ian Hamilton and other generals who were concerned in the field. I hope the right honourable gentleman will consider this matter very carefully. I know that the Prime Minister was given notice of the intention of the right honourable gentlemen (Sir H. Dalziel) to raise it, and I trust that in his reply the Colonial Secretary will do his best to give effect to the appeal which has been made to him.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (MR. BONAR LAW): The Prime Minister has asked me to give the reply of the Government to the request which we were informed was going to be made by my right honourable friend (Sir H. Dalziel). As he has pointed^ out, that in publishing the Papers already laid before the House in regard to the expedition in Mesopotamia the Government have taken a step which, in his view, makes it difficult to refuse to publish Papers in regard to the Dardanelles. We quite realise that in publishing those Papers in regard to Mesopotamia we were taking a step which was open to criticism, but we came to the conclusion, and I think rightly, for I have not changed the view I have always held since the war began, that the public and the House of Commons should be given all the information which can by any possibility be issued without detriment to the military service. We therefore carefully considered the question of these Papers, and decided that, though preparations are still going on in this case, yet in regard to this particular phase of them, which is finished, Papers could be laid without detriment to the interests of the public
service. My right honourable frieHd asks that some opportunity should be given for discussion in this House, and on that all I need say is that in publishing the3e Papers the Government recognised that the House of Commons were entitled to have this subject discussed, and if there is on the part of the House a desire for discussion on the Mesopotamia Expedition opportunity will be given after the recess.In regard to the Dardanelles and the publication of the Papers, what is the principle which should guide the Government in a matter of this kind ? In the first place, what is the object of going into this, and what is to be gained by going into it ? My right honourable friend puts one consideration to me, the importance of which I need not say I do not under-estimate. He says that the publication of these Papers may probably show that there are people still exercising authority who may perhaps be proved to have made such mistakes that they should no longer be allowed to hold positions of authority. If that is true, the sooner the Papers are published the better. In regard to the Dardanelles, as in regard to Mesopotamia, the Government have come to the conclusion that it is better, on the whole, that the Papers should be published, and that the House of Commons should be given information. That being so, I need not say that it is the desire and intention of the Government to lay the Papers on the table as soon as possible. It is quite obvious that, if a story is to be told, then the whole of it should be told. There are only two limitations which I shall make with regard to the publication of these Papers. There may be documents of so confidential a character that they ought not to be published, and the other is, as I am sure the House will realise, that there is at least a possibility that some of the Papers might give information which might be useful to the enemy in regard to operations which are still going on. All I can say, therefore, is that these two considerations will be kept in view by the Government, but there intention is that nothing shall be withheld which is not against public interests. tfiuLirMR. OUTHWAITE : Will the diplomatic correspondence relating to the Dardanelles be also published ?MR. BONAR LAW: I am not at all sure that there is any relevant diplomatic correspondence, but if there is that will certainly be considered as well.PRUSTED Xa SI KHESB3GM CVVIC8 BY O. S.
