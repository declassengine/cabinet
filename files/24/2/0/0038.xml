, WIW.....W -fcjlllll  -I-11.....[This Document is the Property..of His Britannic Majestys government.]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   October 1916.17SUPPLY OF AEROPLANES.Note by Mr! Montagu. (Previous Papers G-.-77 and G.-83.)1. THE main point for which I contended in my previous memorandum to the War Committee is granted by -Lord Curzon in his reply. He agrees that &quot;it is inexpedient to leave the supply of aeroplanes to the Admiralty and the War Office in independence of each other,&quot; and that, therefore, the establishment of ^some^ new-machinery is necessary. I have already expressed my opinion in endorsing Sir A. Roger&apos;8 memorandum to the Air Board, dated the 10th August, and in my recent memorandum to the War Committee, that this new machinery should be in the nature of an extension of the Ministry of Munitions, co-ordinated with the other Supply branches for which that Ministry is now responsible.2. Lord Curzon has not as yet submitted his alternative scheme, which has no doubt been under consideration by the Air Board since its formation in May last. By a process of elimination of the War Office, the Admiralty, and the Ministry of Munitions as possible Supply Departments for the Air Services, it would seem that Lord Curzon&apos;s scheme must take the form of the creation of a new Department under the immediate control of the Air Board itself. I should like to point out that such a proposal, would go as far beyond the terms of reference given to the Air Board as my proposal may be thought to fall short of them.3. In the absence of any definite proposal from the Air Board, I was compelled in my last memorandum to confine myself to general arguments in favour of concen-trating as far as possible in one Department the supply of all munitions, &amp;c, wdiich draw on the same common stocks of labour, material, and plant. Lord Curzon, in his present memorandum, does not attempt to answer these general arguments. He has rather contented himself with repeating certain criticisms of the details of Sir A. Rogers memorandum to the Air Board of the 10th August, and in doing so has repeated the misconceptions shown in the Air Board&apos;s reply to that memorandum.4 The first and most important of these misconceptions is that &quot;the great achievement of the Ministry of Munitions consisted in the production of a vast output of standard equipment in a comparatively short space of time.&quot; While, of course, rapid production has been among the first considerations in the task the Ministry had to perform, it is quite wrong to imagine that the munitions which have been produced have been or are even now only of standard patterns. The number of changes of design in the fuzes perhaps the most intricate piece of mechanism with which the Ministry has dealt so far-are alone sufficient argument on this point. Unfortunately, the problem of obtaining production of an article the specification of which is continually changing in the light of experience is one with which the Ministry is only too familial&quot;.o. The second misconception is that the three conditions laid down in the fourth paragraph of Lord Curzon&apos;s memorandum as being vital to successful production of aircraft would be fulfilled more easily if the production of aircraft were controlled by an outside body rather than by the Ministry of Munitions.. Perhaps I may examine these three conditions in more detail :-6. Firstly, Lord Curzon emphasises the importance of ensuring that the designer and manufacturer should work in the closest possible touch with the user of the machine. I fitid it difficult to see why the intervention of a Supply Department which was part of the Ministry of Munitions should endanger that &quot; close touch &quot; any more than the intervention of a Supply Department which was independent of the Ministry. 17. Secondly, Lord Curzon savs that &quot;the Air Services should have at their [1173]SECRET. G.-84.
command the best designing and inventive ability in respect of aeronautics which the country possesses.&quot; Again, I confess I find myself in a difficulty. If my suggestions are adopted I assume that the Ministry of Munitions will obtain the services of those who have been dealing with these matters in the past, and the Ministry of Munitions, with its wide ramifications and its large staff of skilled engineers in touch with almost every workshop in the kingdom, is. it seems to me, at least as likely to be able to draw on the &quot; best designing and inventive ability which the country possesses &quot; as any new body, without that close touch with the manufacturing world, could hope to be.8. Thirdly, Lord Curzon postulates &quot; the greatest possible flexibility in the arrange-ments for the manufacture of aircraft to permit of constant variation and modification of pattern following upon the heels of experience.&quot; I had thought that I had dealt with this point, in anticipation, in paragraph 11 of my last memorandum, and I should like to point out here that Lord Curzon&apos;s criticism of that paragraph is based on a misunderstanding of its meaning. I take it as agreed that a development of existing engineering resources in order to increase the supply of aircraft engines is necessary. This development Lord Curzon, as he says at the bottom of p. 2 of his memorandum, would bring about by extending the specialisation of firms on particular types of engines on the lines on which supply is already being obtained, that is to say, by increasing the number of firms making complete engines (if, indeed, any firm even at present is making a complete engine, which I doubt, and is not relying on other firms for component parts). My arguments in paragraph 11 of my last memorandum did not mean that at present &quot; a large number of firms &apos;is concerned with the production of any one engine.&quot; I wished to point out rather that an extension of the basis of production on the lines advocated then and now by Lord Curzon must lead to an increase in the number of firms making the complete engine, whereas under the method of expansion which I believe to be the better that is, by specialising particular firms on particular operations or components the tendency would be to decrease the number of firms making any particular part which in the light of experience might require modification. This would make it easier to alter designs. I would repeat, therefore, what I have said before that a broadening of the basis of production on the lines suggested in my last memorandum means greater flexibility, combined with heavier production, than any extension such as that suggested by Lord Curzon.9. With regard to paragraph 12, again I fear Lord Curzon has misunderstood. I did not contend that at present firms making aircraft engines were also engaged to any considerable extent on orders from other Government Departments (although of the firms which he names Messrs. Gwynne, Rolls Royce, W. K. Allen and Sons, Wolseley, and Siddeley Deasy are all engaged on contracts for other than aircraft supplies). What I did contend and what I contend now is that it is not possible to hand over more firms for the production of aeroplane engines to the exclusion of every other war work. More particularly is this true now that the demands for motor transport of all kinds have increased as they have. So far as I can see, therefore, some such state of affairs as I suggested in paragraph 12 of my last memorandum is inevitable if Lord Ourzon&apos;s plan is followed.10. Lord Curzon says that all the powers and resources of the Ministry, and especially its control of priority of labour and material, can be placed at the disposal of an outside body. I can only refer to the arguments I advanced in paragraph 7 of my last memorandum, which have not been answered by Lord Curzon.11. I fully appreciate the urgency of the demands which the Air Board have pressed upon the Aiinistry, but I must point out that in the present state ,of affairs a request for &quot; only &quot; 7.000 workmen is one which cannot easily be granted. It is because I am convinced that the needs of the Air Services can be met more expeditiously and more economically as regards men and plant by entrusting the work to the Ministry of Munitions that 1 ask the War Committee to consider once more the general arguments which I. put forward in my last memorandum.12. I have no wish to anticipate the appearance of alternative suggestions from Lord Curzon, but I.would point out that the matter, if it is to be dealt with at all, should be dealt with at once, and I would ask that if Lord Curzon&apos;s suggestions are likely to conflict with mine he might indicate where they conflict, or at least tell us that his proposals will be before us very soon.E.
