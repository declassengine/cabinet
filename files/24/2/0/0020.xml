Printed for the use of the Committee of Imperial Defence.   March 1916.SECRET. G.-66.The Naval Situation.LETTER FROM LORD FISHER TO THE PRIME. MINISTER.SQ; Berkeley Square, London, W., My dear Prime Minister, March 15, 1916.I HAVE returned to the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence the manuscript notes taken at the meeting of the War Committee on the 8th March, at which I was present at your request. According to the notes the discussion was largely devoted to labour questions, and only incidentally to the matters which I had been summoned to discuss, as set forth in the letters to which you referred in your opening remarks, and especially in the formal communication giving my views, which I addressed to you, dated the 18th February. L demur to some of the statements that were made by the Admiralty representatives, and I also desire to amplify my remarks on some of the points raised, and therefore I beg to request that this memorandum may be printe i and circulated to all who were present at the meeting.I have stated in previous communications to you that in my opinion the Grand Fleet is dangerously short of destroyers and small craft of ah types. The First Sea Lord admits that there is a shortage, which will compel caution as regards the Grand Fleet. You informed me at the meeting, though it does not appear on the notes, that all were agreed that there was a serious (I think you used even a stronger word) shortage of destro)7ers and small craft. My statement is therefore admitted generally. Having in view that the Admiralty - acknowledge that they have no information whatever as to what work is in progress, in German shipyards, though it is well known that these have been working at extreme pressure throughout the war, in itself an alarming and somewhat astonishing admission, it is evident that the Admiralty acknowledgment of a shortage becomes even more momentous if, as is quite possible, large and unexpected increases of destroyers appear with the German High Sea Fleet shortly.The reason for the existing shortage in destroyers is that the Admiralty have not maintained the punctual and accelerated delivery of those ordered by their predecessors; the reason for the existing shortage of mine-sweepers and small craft of other types and for the probabfy accentuated shortage of destroyers for many months to come for all the war, unless drastic steps are taken is that the Admiralty have failed since last June to continue to place orders for these vessels to the utmost extent possible as slips became vacant.It was stated that the reason for the vessels being late in delivery, and for not ordering more, is the shortage of labour, and also that the majority of the men who left the shipyards left while I was at the Admiralty.   It was not, of course, my business to deal with labour questions as First Sea Lord.   But I wanted the ships, and I meant to have them, and therefore I told the builders to come to me personally if they got into any difficulty or met with any obstacle that was likely to delay the completion.   In the spring of last year 1 received some complaints from these shipbuilders that men were being allowed to leave them to join the army.   I took up the matter personally with Lord Kitchener, and he gave me an assurance that instructions would be issued to, recruiting officers not to take any more men from shipyards without the consent of their employers.   For the remainder of my time at the Admiralty I received no more complaints from any shipbuilders who were employed on urgent work.   Further,! arrangements were made at this time for the transfer of men from mercantile building! yards to yards where they were required for Naval work, especially on the Clyde.   It would be interesting to obtain a statement of the numbers of men employed, for example,, at Clydebank and Fairfield, where the &quot;Renown&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; are under construction, -on the 1st November, 1914, and on the 1st June, 1915, respectively.  I should say that they were increased at least 50 per cent., though it was stated at the meeting of the War Committee that the amount of labour was reduced while I was at the Admiraltv ![3961 B
It is an entirely fallacious statement that delay in the delivery of one vessel is any reason why others should not be ordered at the same time in the same yard. The men who finish a ship do not do the early work on her, and, so long as the vessel is launched and the slip vacant, another vessel can be commenced with little or no interference; there is no reason whatever why succeeding vessels should also be late. It is not surprising that there will be a shortage if these principles have been followed.Although not pertinent to anything that I have advocated in my communications to you, I notice that the Third Sea Lord stated that all the large slips had been filled by my programme, and consequently no more ships of the largest size could have been laid down. I arranged for Cammell, Laird and Co. to lengthen one of their slips to 1,000 feet, and hoped to have laid down on this slip a new type of fast battle-cruiser last summer. This slip has been ready since last summer, and, J am informed, has been vacant ever since ! There are also other slips that could have been made suitable in a short time if the Admiralty wanted to use them.I was always being told at the Admiralty that things could not possibly be done, but they were done ! The same arguments appear to hold the field again. I was informed that the &quot; Invincible &quot; (or &quot; Inflexible &quot;) could not leave Devonport (to attack von Spees squadron) for two days after the day appointed because of some defect in the brickwork of her boilers, but she went, and I have not heard since of any ill result! Had those two days been lost, von Spee would have been missed by two days at the Falkland Islands and many things would have been changed. I was told on arriving at the Admiralty, and finding that no new submarines had then been ordered since the war broke out, that it was impossible for anybody but Vickers to make the engines, and that for this reason, and many others, the possible output was very limited ; nevertheless, within a few days large orders were placed with many shipbuilders who had never built submarines or engines before, and I am informed that these are being delivered and are quite satisfactory. I was told that the monitors could not be built in time, and I could cite many examples where the so-called impossible was achieved.It is an astonishing statement to me that the present difficult)&apos;&apos; at the Admiralty is in getting the machinery completed, and that there is no difficulty about the hull work. It was very much the reverse formerly, and there were practically unlimited offers for machinery if the hulls could be built elsewhere. lam convinced that this difficulty could be overcome. There should also&quot; be no difficulty in getting every destroyer completed and delivered in twelve months from the date of the order, provided that the firms are given a free hand, and are not harassed by rules and regulations that may be very necessary in time of peace, but are quite out of place in time of war. I am told that when I left the Admiralty everything was &quot;regularised &quot; again, and all matters were directed to be sent through the proper channels. In consequence, the ships are delayed but no doubt some money is saved, and a lot of trouble to officials.It is evident, from what I heard at the meeting, that my original statement is correct, and that the Admiralty have in the past nine months allowed men to be taken from the shipyards, and have allowed men to be taken who should have been put into the shipyards instead of being sent to the Army or to munitions work. It is also certain that up to the last few days no effective steps have been taken to repair these errors, and to obtain back from the Army the men who are so urgently needed by the shipyards, &amp;c, for new construction and repairs. It is apparent, too, that nothing effective has yet been done by the Admiralty regarding dilution of labour in establishments working for them, from the fact that the formation of a Committee to consider this question was suggested in my presence at the War Council on 8th March.It is also evident that the Admiralty have not continuously ordered destroyers and small craft whenever there was an opportunity, because it was stated at the meeting I that a number of destroyers had just been placed with shipbuilders, and negotiations were in progress for more to be laid down at once. This is undoubtedly the result of the attention which has been drawn to the subject recently by myself and others, and $t would not have been possible if the Admiralty had continuously ordered new destroyers whenever there was an opportunity.I desire also to state, before leaving this subject, that many more destroyers and small craft could have been laid down of all kinds in the autumn of 1914 when I returned to the Admiralty, and consequently would have been completed, or nearly completed, by now, had it not been for the decision of the Cabiuet communicated to the Admiralty by the First Lord, that no vessels were to be commenced that could not be completed by the end of 1915    This decision was modified. later; but had it never
been promulgated many other firms who had not previously been^ employed at this work would have then been utilised, such as those named by the Third Sea Lord, with^ ^manifest advantages at the present critical period.   For this reason, also, there was Cuever any question, so far as 1914 is concerned, of laying down anything larger than a light cruiser.On the subject of the light battle cruisers, &quot;Courageous,&quot; -&apos;-Glorious,&quot; and. &quot; Furious.&quot; I have no hesitation whatever in reaffirming that, had I remained in a position to superintend their construction, the two former would have been finished in May and the latter in July. They would have been laid down and finished earlier, but for the restriction mentioned in the previous paragraph. These vessels were designed and built for a special strategical purpose, but nevertheless they will be extremely valuable for general work with the Grand Fleet. It is not necessary here to go into details, but in my opinion- they will be worth a great number of light cruisers and destroyers to the Commander-ih-Ohtef, both before and during a general action. I am sure the Commander-in-Ohief will not dispute this. They were never intended to replace heavy battle cruisers of the &quot; Lion &quot; type, and it is merely obscuring the issue to discuss them from that point of view. They are supplementary to such ships. The same applies, but in less degree, to&apos;the &quot; Renown&quot;; and &quot;Repulse.&apos;&apos;&apos; It may or may not be the case that more heavy battle cruisers are required, but this has no connection whatever with the building of these light battle cruisers.When I returned to&apos; the Admiralty I found that there were no battle cruisers under construction after the &quot; Tiger,&quot; and that the battleships coming forward after the &quot; Queen Elizabeth &quot; class, all of which were then approaching completion, were the &quot; Royal Sovereign&quot; type, slower than their predecessors and fitted to burn coal, instead of oil only. Why this design was adopted I do not know, unless it were for economy. It was not possible to change the general design of the whole class, as the construction of most of the ships was too far advanced. I did, however, manage to arrange for oil burning only in all, which will considerably improve their speed. The two latest, the &quot;Renown&apos;&apos; and &quot;Repulse,&quot; were only just commenced, and it was found possible to stop the work, to alter the design, and to use up most of the materials. These two ships were accordingly turned into light battle cruisers, and the construction hastened so that there was every prospect that they would be available for service in 15 to 18 months. There is reason to believe that the &quot;Repulse&quot; will be ready, but I understand that the same pace has not been kept on the &quot; Renown,&quot; and that she has been allowed to fall behind like the &quot;Courageous &quot; and &quot; Furious &quot; types.If there is a shortage of battle cruisers of the &quot;Lion-&apos; type at the present moment, it is evident that this must arise from miscalculations before the war. There could not possibly, under- any circumstances, have been such battle cruisers ready for service now or in the near- future that had not been laid down long before the outbreak of war. The Board of Admiralty in the period before the war is alone responsible for any possible deficiency in this respect. Personally, I have always been strongly of opinion that all the &quot;Royal Sovereignsshould have been battle cruisers, which are the dominating type of the day. But, nevertheless, I would most certainly, had it been left to me, have pressed forward the building of battle cruisers of the largest and most heavily armed type in the period since last May, in view of the uncertainty that came about as to the duratiou of the war, the lack of knowledge of the German programme, and the necessity for being prepared for all eventualities. I had%the design of this type fully prepared and a model made just before I left the Admiralty. The necessary labour could have been procured if sufficiently energetic action had been taken, and the order placed judiciously.In my opinion, however, ships of the &quot; Repulse,&quot; &quot; Courageous,&quot; and &quot; Furious &quot; types were more required, at the time and under the conditions when they were commenced, than heavy battle cruisers, especially having in view the rapidity with which they could be finished and in service, whereas the heavier type could not under any circumstances be built in under two years. My views on this point have not changed, and I consider it a calamity that any of these ships have been allowed to fall behind in their dates of delivery.I do not know whether more 18-inch guns of the &quot;Furious&quot; type have been ordered for succeeding ships or not, and so as to be ready for emergencies. I personally pressed the First Lord to order more last September, but I understand that nothing has been done. In my opinion they will be wanted, if only for swift monitors, supposing the heavy battle cruisers have not been proceeded with. I also do not know whether anything has been done to increase our resources for constructing guns and [396] &apos;   B2
mountings of 18-inch, or even larger. I understand that only at Elswick can 18-inch guns be built, and that the plant of none of the other big manufacturers, ic, Woolwich, Vickers, Coventry, or Beardmore, is capable of dealing with guns of this size anc J weight. I know that we had to order a special large crane-lighter for use at Elswick shipyards in lifting the &quot; Furious &quot; guns. Unless some action has been taken since last May, then the position still remains that the only establishment capable of dealing with these guns and mountings of the largest size is the one which is most susceptible of attack and destruction by Zeppelins, and much valuable time has been lost.I have noticed that the First Lord has stated that the ordering of the monitors has caused delay in the completion of the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; class of battleship, owing to the 15-inch guns being taken for the monitors. So far as lam aware, only two monitors have been armed with 15-inch guns, and each with a pair of guns only. Therefore, four guns and two barbettes, or one-half of the mountings and guns of one battleship only, were taken for these monitors. These armaments were ordered to be diverted early in 1915, and could easily have been replaced in time for the last ship of the class. It was also contemplated to build two more monitors with i 5-inch guns, but I understand that this was cancelled when I left the Admiralty. In all these matters I write under the disadvantage of having no exact official knowledge of the building-programme since I left. It is possible that the speeding-up of the &quot; Renown &quot; and the &quot;Repulse,&quot; and the ordering and hastening of the &quot; Courageous &quot; and &quot;Glorious,&quot; has been a cause of delay with the guns and mountings of some of the &quot; Royal Sovereign^,&quot; coupled with the building of the two monitors. This, however, is a totally different matter. This is not a case of diverting materials from a capital ship to a subsidiary service, but of diverting from one capital ship to another, from a slow battleship to a very fast battle cruiser where the guns and mountings can be more profitably used. I make no suggestion, and I have never heard of any suggestion, that there is a deficiency of battleships, either now or in the near future. The monitors have proved their value, and this is an unnecessary side issue which obscures the important facts of the present position.There is a further matter to which I did not have opportunity to allude at the War Committee, in connexion with submarine design and construction. I was not satisfied even with the large and powerful new types of fleet submarines which were designed and commenced while I was at the Admiralty, and I gave instructions for a still larger type to carry a heavy gun of 12 inches, or even larger, to be looked into and a design obtained. Had I remained at the Admiralty I would have urged that a number of these should be proceeded with as soon as possible. Designs of a submarine to carry a 12-inch gun were ready last August, and I personally urged the First Lord to have the vessels proceeded with. Since that time the question has been considered and referred and delayed so that I understand that only in the last few weeks has an order been placed, and for one submarine only. I consider that at least six should be commenced at once, and pressed on with the utmost possible despatch, so as to be completed by the end of the year.For facility of reference I enclose a copy of my letter sent to you dated the 18th February last.FISHER.
(Secret.) 36, Berkeley Square,My dear Prime Minister, Friday, February 18, 1916.IN view of Sir A. K. Wilson having attended the recent War Council before which Sir John Jellicoe was summoned to give his opinion on the naval situation, as outlined in my two letters to you of the 22nd January and the 24th January in both of which I urged you that Sir John Jellicoe should be summoned I am very sorry you did .not also permit me to attend, to enable me to elicit from Sir John Jellicoe his views on the opinions I had expressed regarding the present navai situation.I do not know what passed at the meeting, or what conclusion was reached, but now that you have heard Sir John Jellicoe I feel it incumbent on me to write this further letter to you giving my view of the actual position in more detail, because in my decided opinion the present naval situation is fraught with great danger. You told me in the Lobby of the House of Commons some weeks ago that you intended to consult me on the general naval situation, so presumably the matter was troubling you, and well it may!I have now to make the statement that in the immediate future, instead of our former assured victory over the German Fleet, the possibilities of what the Germans can have done in the last eighteen months I have no official knowledge of what they have actually done renders, doubtful the issue of a battle between the British and German fleets, if the British Fleet is weakened, as it may be, in its journey south to meet the German Fleet. In the first three months of the war we did little with our huge shipbuilding resources to countervail all possible German naval efforts in the direction of strengthening their Navy, and m the last nine months of the war we have also been supine, and have allowed men to leave our shipyards, instead of largely increasing their numbers with the set purpose of immensely increasing our destroyers, our submarines, our mine-sweepers, and our small craft generally, and of completing the 15-inch battle cruisers &quot;Renown&quot; and &quot;Revenge&quot; during the early spring, and the &quot; Furious &quot; with her. 18-inch guns and her sister Dreadnought battle cruisers by the early summer. The &quot; Furious &quot; will not now be finished this year, unless exceptional exertions are made at once.As I mentioned &quot;to you in my letters of the 22nd and 24th January, the British Fleet runs a great risk, if the German destroyers, &amp;c, exist in the numbers possible, while the destroyers building in this country are being so lamentably delayed.If Sir John Jellicoe did not state this fact to the War Council he ought to have done so, because when he meets the German Fleet at close quarters on his arrival south, the British Fleet may have been so weakened owing to deficiencies in destroyers and small craft as might necessitate Sir John Jellicoe declining action, or else result in our defeat if action is joined.I am fully aware there is nothing so exasperating to other people as recounting the fulfilment of one&apos;s own prophecies. I. only do so to support my present prophecy, as stated in the immediately preceding paragraph.On the 24th April, 1912, I wrote the strongest protest possible to Mr. Winston Churchill against the proposed employment of Sir Berkeley Milne as Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean, predicting disaster in the event of war if the appointment were made. This disaster occurred in the escape of the &quot; Goeben &quot; ; she threatened to bombard the Sultan&apos;s Palace at Constantinople and this resulted in Turkey joining our enemies, and led directly to the Dardanelles, followed by Salonica, and finally to the disastrous attempt to reach Bagdad in order to cover the evacuation of Gallipoli.Six months before the war I handed you a paper on the submarine menace. It was completely fulfilled, though scouted at the time, and the First Lord of the Admiralty said it was marred by the statement &quot; that submarines would sink merchant ships with their passengers and crews!&quot;I represented the terrible drain the Dardanelles would cause in our naval resources, deflecting thein from the decisive theatre of the war. It is not too much to say the present hazard in the North Sea would be very appreciably less had all the vessels that were diverted to that expedition been kept at Sir J. Jellicoe&apos;s disposal. It is impossible in a short memorandum to explain the many ways in which the Dardanelles have drained the Grand Fleet.The blockade and the mining policy, set forth in representations in January 1915, were ignored with disastrous results.More than a year ago, at a meeting of the War Council on the 7th January, 1915, I pointed out the danger of the Zeppelin menace, and went so far as to place my resignation in the hands of Mr. Churchill, because of my -certainty of their raiding and
scouting possibilities, and my conviction of the inadequacy of the steps that were being taken to meet the menace, but was induced to withdraw it as being against the public interest that I should do so at that time and on such a subject. The Zeppelins now, with a radius of 600 miles and capable of attaining a height of 15.000 feet with a speed of 70 to 80 miles, can attack the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow with impunity, as present British aircraft are of but little use against them. Perhaps even a greater danger is the ability of these German Zeppelins to disclose, by wireless, all the move-ments of the Grand Fleet, and so to render impossible any surprise attack of ours by keeping all our fleet dispositions known to the enemy.Then comes the fulfilment of the prophecy that the Dreadnought type of battle cruiser the &quot; all-one-big-gun &quot; ship of very high speed would knock out all other types when war came. This was exemplified in the destruction of von Spee&apos;s squadron at^ the Falkland Islands, when the British Admiral annihilated von Spee&apos;s squadron and had not one man killed or wounded in his flagship, the Dreadnought battle cruiser &quot; Invincible.&quot;I mention the above merely to show that hitherto my opinions deliberately expressed have been worthy of some attention, and I repeat again that in my view the menace of the German fleet is greater than any that has ever threatened the existence of the British Empire, and that immediate drastic steps are vital in order to meet this menace.FISHER.printed at the foreign office by c e. habbison .-21/3/1916.
