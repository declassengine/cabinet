Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1916.SECRET.THE STRATEGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF SWEDISH INTERVENTION IN THE WAR ON THE SIDE OF THE CENTRAL POWERS.Note Prepared by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff for theWar Committee.L SWEDEN has a population of about 5,600,000 souls. The Army consists^ of 6 divisions, each of 18 battalions of infantry, 4 squadrons of cavalry, and 11 batteries, amounting to a total force of:  ,108 battalions. N24 squadrons.66 batteries, consisting of 264 field guns and howitzers. 8 batteries of heavy artillery, chiefly 15-cm. howitzers.&quot;^o u^!!f^0I1^c&apos;        r cavalry division. 6 batteries 75-mm. J JThese amount to about 180,000 men on a war footing.In addition to these first line troops, there are the fortress troops, which are now mobilised, the Bevaring (which includes the above-mentioned 180,000 men), and the Landstorm.The fortress troops provide garrisons for the following: The entrenched camp of Boden. The Stockholm defences. The Karlskrona defences. The Karlsborg defences.The Bevaring (1st and 2nd Bans) constitutes the first line troops and a reserve for them and for the fortress troops. It consists of between 350,000 and 370,000 men, of which 200,000 to 210,000 will be absorbed in placing the first line anci fortress troops on a war footing.   There will thus remain available, say, 160,000 men.The Landstorm consists of a home defence force of 157 battalions, of which 97 are said to be now distributed along the frontiers.It is bebeved that 2 reserve divisions (29 battalions) are in course of formation, presumably from the Bevaring, and probably numbering about 40,000 men.The total force that Sweden can put in the field may therefore be taken as about 220,000 men, with about 120,000 drafts. By - calling up - untrained men she m ght produce another 200,000 men.&quot;Last September it was estimated that there were not more than 850 rounds available, per 75-mm. field gun. It is probable, therefore, that in the event of war, Sweden would look to Germany for a considerable part of her ammunition supply.2. The only hostile action which Sweden can take against Great Britain will be to place restrictions on trade. Her main object in going to war on the side of the Central Powers will be to relieve herself of the Russian incubus by taking advantage of Russia&apos;s present difficulties.3. With this end in view, she will probably avoid a quarrel with Norway.   Should she, however, decide to attack that country, her most probable immediate objective would be the seizure of one or both of the Norwegian ports of Narvik and Trondhjem, but by so doing she would divert her forces from the main objective, Russia, and [228-4]Cm
would set Norway against her merely to gain two ports, which would he of little use to Germany and none to herself.- To bring in Norway on the side of the Entente, thus enabling Great Britain to establish an effective blockade of Scandinavia, would be far too high a price for Germany to pay in order to obtain submarine bases at Narvik and Trondhjem. On the other hand, if Sweden leaves Norway alone, she has nothing to fear from her, since it is improbable that the latter country would go to war unless attacked.4. It is inconceivable that Denmark should attack Sweden. The threat of a few German battalions being sent across the Danish frontier into Jutland and of a bombard-ment of Copenhagen by the German fleet would prevent any such action being, contemplated.5. Sweden would therefore have little cause to fear that her neutral neighbours would attack her, and could safely concentrate the bulk of her available forces against Russia. It may be assumed that the German General Staff would take control over the Swedish Army in the same way as they control those of Austria and Bulgaria, and consequently that they would use that army in the way that would best serve German interests.   There are three ways in which this could be done : (1.) To invade Finland north of 1he Gulf of Bothnia.(2.) To land at Abo or Hango and invade Southern Finland.(3.) To land about Reval, or at any raie north of Riga, with a view to an advanceon Petrograd in co-operation with a German offensive from the Dwinafront.6. The first course involves a very long and difficult line of communications and leads to no important objective. The single-line railway between Stockholm and Haparanda is 650 miles long, and all goods have to be unloaded: at the latter place as there is no railway communication across the Tornea River, which forms the frontier. Even if such communication were provided, the.gauge of the Russian railways is broader than that of the Swedish, consequently Swedish rolling-stock could not be u&apos;sM Oh them before the gauge had been altered. If, therefore, the Russians were to withdraw all rolling-stock from the frdhtier districts, the Swedes would find the greatest difficulty in supplying their troops as they advanced into Finland.The distances from Hapardhda to any important objective are very great, and the roads are] tew and bad. The Alexandrovsk-Kandalakscha railway, which the Russians expect to complete by the middle of March, but which will probably not be opened till considerably later, is 260 miles distant from Tornea at its nearest point, while the Archangel-Petrograd railway is 500 miles away to the south-east. The country lying between these railways and the Gulf of Bothnia is very thinly populated and almost roadless, being a tangle of rocks, lakes, and forests. Abo and Helsingfors are also 500 miles away to the south, and should the railway be unutilisable to the Swedes, it would seem impossible that they could maintain so long a line of road communication. * As they advanced they would have to open up bases along the sea coast at Uleaborg, Gamla-Karleby, Vasa, Bjorneborg, and Abo, so that it would be much more advantageous to them to adopt the second course at once arid make their initial landing at Abo or thereabouts.The only objectives of any importance that could be threatened from the Russo-Swedish frontier are the proposed routes for forwarding munitions from Skiboth in Norway, and from Petschenga and Alexandrovsk on the Murman coast via Rovaniemi. None of these routes are at present in use, and even*if they were, they are only needed during the winter when the White Sea is frozen. The former of them could be blocked at any moment by a very small force of Swedes, as it runs for many miles just outside the Swedish frontier, while the latter could be cut by the occupation of Kemi, which is only 16 miles from Haparanda, and by the destruction of the railway which runs from that place along the Kemijoki to Rovaniemi (71 miles), an operation requiring only a small raiding force.7. The second course, namely to land in Southern Finland has much more to recommend it. The country contains a considerable quantity of supplies. Abo is a town of political importance, while Helsingfors, a city of 150,000 inhabitants, is the.* To&apos; show how easily the railway might be damaged, it may be mentioned that there are 53 bridges in tBe 80 miles between Tornea and rjleaborg.
23capital of the Grand Duchy and the centre of its trade. There are other important manufacturing towns such as Tammarfors in this area, so that if the occupation of Finland or of any part of it were the Swedish main objective, a landing about Abo or Hango would be the best way of effecting it. A landing at Helsingfors would not be possible before the fortress of Sveaborg,- which defends its harbour, was reduced.It is frequently suggested that a Swedish invasion of Finland would be the signal for a general rising of the population, but there is reason to doubt such a statement. The population of Finland is about 3,200,000. It consists of two sharply defined elements, the Finns proper, who number about 2,800,000, and the Swedish upper classes numbering about 400,000. Both nationalities dislike the Russians, owing to the repressive measures adopted by General Bobrikoff about seventeen years ago, and by succeeding Governors-General, and this dislike has undoubtedly been fanned by the Germans for their own purposes. The feeling of the Swedish population of Finland is in general intensely anti-Russian,&apos; that of the Finns is less so. The Swedish Finlanders are to be found only in the country districts of the south-western part of the Grand Duchy, and in the towns. Their relations with the true Finns are far from cordial, and it is improbable that they would unite, as the latter would dislike Swedish rule quite as much as Russian.It is, however, probable that if Swedish troops landed in south-western Finland the Swedish population would join them, provided they were supplied with arms, and the very broken character of the country would greatly assist the operations of guerrilla bands.If, as indicated in a previous paragraph, the main Swedish objective was to assist Germany to crush Russia and not merely to occupy western Finland, a landing about Abo and an advance via Helsingfors would not be very effective. The distance from Abo to Petrograd by rail is 400 miles, and the line, except for the 44 miles between Helsingfors and Riihimaki, and the 80 miles between Viborg and Petrograd, is single. All practicable routes from Finland towards Petrograd converge on Viborg, and should the Russians refuse to detach any large force to oppose the Swedes they need only hold the line of the Saima Canal, 30 miles long, from Viborg to Villmanstrand.8. The third course, namely^ to invade Esthonia, appears to offer the greater strategical advantages. The risks of sea transport thither from Sweden are probably less than to Finland, as the Aland islands and the Finnish Skargard are specially well adapted for the operations of defending torpedo craft. The landing could be made under the protection of the combined German and Swedish fleets, and once landed the Swedish troops would find themselves in rear of the Russian defensive line of the Dvina, and could co-operate with the Germans in an advance on Petrograd which is only 210 miles from Reval.The shores of the Gulf of Finland have pleasant historical associations for the Swedes, as they were the scene of the victory of Charles XII, the national hero, over the Russains at Narva, a fact which might be used to overcome any disinclination on the part of the Swedes to embark on a foreign war.9. Should Sweden undertake such an expedition she would find it necessary to leave garrisons for her fortresses, and to provide troops for the defence of the Russian frontier. She would also have to provide guards for the Norwegian frontier, and troops to repel possible British raids on her coast-line. Deducting these forces, she should be able to put not less than six divisions in the field against Russia and maintain them at full strength.10. The most favourable time for a Swedish landing on the Russian coast would be in spring, when the ice is breaking up in the Gulf of Riga and at the mouth of the Gulf of Finland. The Russian fleet might then be ice-bound in the Gulf of Finland, while the mines in the Gulf of Riga, Baltisch Port, and other harbours, might be exploded by contact with the ice-floes, and submarines could only operate with difficulty. Such a landing, combined with a German offensive, might compel the Russian armies to retire, and so facilitate an advance on Petrograd. It may be mentioned that a landing on the coast of Esthonia could, if naval conditions permit, be carried out equally well by German troops, and this danger must not therefore be considered as arising solely out of Swedish intervention.. 11. It follows from the above that the actual military effect of Swedish inter-vention would be confined to a ^reinforcement of some 20Q,-Q00 good troops to the
enemy&apos;s forces in the Eastern theatre, and to bring in such a reinforcement would be in accordance with Germany&apos;s present military policy of supplementing her diminishing reserves of men by inducing other nations to fight for her.There are signs that Germany has not abandoned her intention of forcing the Dvina line, and unquestionably Petrograd is a far more important objective than Kiev or Odessa. Reports are constantly being spread, both in the press and through diplomatic channels, of Austro-German concentrations against Russia and Southern Russia, while, at the same time, every pressure is being brought on Roumania to force her to call for. Russian assistance. The enemy&apos;s object in this may be to attract Russian troops to the south and thus weaken the northern and most vital part of the line, so that it may be attacked with better hopes of success. If Germany has such a plan in view the co-operation of a force of six divisions of fresh troops might be very useful, but it does not appear at present that the intervention of Sweden in any other form would seriously affect the course of the war.W.
