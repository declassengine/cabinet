17THE TRANSPORT OF WAR MATERIAL TO RUSSIA.THE transport of war material.from various sources of production to Russia forms a question which has been absorbing the attention of the International Commission and the Transport Department of the Admiralty for some time past. Unfortunately, no decision has yet been reached. Unless an organised scheme can be settled within the next four weeks I am convinced that, owing to the fact of the White Sea having been closed considerably longer this winter by ice, as soon as it is free the ports will be entirely blocked by the arrival of not only material of war from all parts of the world but goods of a private industrial character.The Russian Government show no signs of attempting to deal with the question by any organised programme, consequently I consider that unless His Majestys Government will authorise the Admiralty, which is the only Department capable of doing the work, to make an offer to undertake the control of the transport of a given quantity of war material to Russia during this year, at the same time stating the conditions upon which they are prepared to act, His Majesty&apos;s Government are incurring very grave responsibility.Owing to lack of ships, Russia is quite incapable of transporting her own war supplies ; she will therefore be obliged to enter into the neutral freight market in competition with us, and will almost certainly raise prices owing to the high rates she will be willing to pay.There are therefore two main reasons why the British Admiralty should undertake this work : 1. Unless the traffic is efficiently controlled there will be wastage of tonnage,delays at the ports of unloading, and in the return of vessels, which mayhave disastrous results on the conduct of the war. 2. It is in our own interests to control so far as possible the chartering of freight inthe neutral market; above all, to avoid competition with our Allies in thismarket.r  SECRET.It will be recollected that in May 1915 I drew the attention of the War Office to the fact that the authorities at Petrograd were continually refusing offers to supply munitions of war from the U.S.A. which were being laid before them by their delegates on the International Commission. It . is owing to the very strong line then taken by Lord Kitchener in offering to place contracts on behalf of the Russian Government in the U.S.A. that Russia will shortly be receiving from that source vast quantities of munitions of every description. Similar responsibility must be taken again by His Majestys Government with regard to the transport of these munitions but, unless speedy action is taken, it will be too late, as the White Sea will be open and chaos will have begun.On the 19th Feoruary I called a meeting to consider this question which was attended by the Russian delegates concerned on the International Commission, and representatives of the Admiralty and the War Office. A copy of the decisions arrived at at this meeting signed by those present is attached hereto. The importance of the decisions arrived at lies in the fact that the Russian representatives present were unanimous in their opinion that the British Admiralty are in a position to make practically what conditions they choose should they offer to take over the transport of Russian war material. The conditions suggested at this meeting are undoubtedly severe, and it is possible that the Admiralty may think it necessary to go still further before taking the responsibility. The good-will and co-operation of the Russian authorities at the ports in question must, of course, at all costs be secured, and the success or failure of the scheme to be adopted will probably in no small measure depend upon the character and tact of the officers appointed to carry it out.[355jPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   March 1916.
Should it be considered that for one reason or another it is inadvisable for the Admiralty to guarantee the transport of the whole quantity for which it is estimated tonnage will have to be provided during 1916, I would suggest that sooner than leave the provision of freight to the haphazard, hand-to-mouth method in which it is being dealt with to-day, partly by the Admiralty, partly by the Russian Government, with-out any co-ordination or cohesion of any sort, it would be far better if the Admiralty could be authorised to undertake a certain definite proportion or section of the transport, leaving the balance to be looked after by the Russsian Government themselves.(Signed)   E. WYLDBOEE SMITH.March 2, 1916.Transport of War Material for the Bussian Government.The Russian Delegation on - the International Commission estimate that the following quantities of war material will require to be transported to Russia from . different sources during 1916 : 1. From United States of America, including orders placed by  Tons.(a.) The British Government, through Messrs. J. P. Morgan and Go. &quot;j[b.) The Russian Supplies Committee iu Mew York.. .. ^1,400,000(c.) Petrograd direct,   .. .. .. .. .. J2. Orders placed in France .. .. .. .. .. ..   300X00(Note. The, Hudson Bay Company report that during the period 1st July to 31st December they chartered twenty-three vessels with a total dead weight capacity of 94,547 tons for the transport of munitions of war from Brest to Archangel.)3. United Kingdom (O Coal-; .. .. ..      :   .. .. ..   800,000. (Note. The quantity of coal imported into White Sea ports for the Russian Marine in 1915 was 798,000 tons.)(b.) Munitions of war, including munitions proper, metals, machinery,cloth, saddlery, drugs, &amp;c.        .. ..       ... ..   500,000Total     .. .. .. .. ..3,000,000From information received by the Russian delegates it would appear that it would be possible to despatch goods from Archangel at the rate of 42,000 tons per week. This information, however, does not tally with that received from the British Senior Niival Officer at the White Sea. It will consequently be necessary to. have further information with regard to the figures given. On the assumption that these figures are reliable, and that Archangel will open for twenty-four weeks, 1,000,000 tons of goods should be despatched during that period, but a larger larger quantity of goods could be unloaded at Archangel and despatched after the port is closed. For the sake of argument, therefore, the figure of 1,750,000 tons might be despatched to Archangel. This would leave a balance of 1,250,000 tons to be despatched to Russia via Vladivostock and/or Dalny.It is suggested that the Admiralty should be asked whether they would be prepared to undertake the control of the transport of this quantity of goods on behalf of the Russian Government on the following terms : 1. That the whole of the Russian Mercantile Marine should be placed at the disposal of the British Admiralty with the exception of such vessels whose services cannot be dispensed with.(Note. The total tonnage of the R-ussian Volunteer Fleet was stated to be 100,000 tons, and that the total available. tonnage of the Russian Mercantile Marine would probably not amount to more than some 150,000 tons.)2. No vessel should be allowed to enter the Bay of Alexandrovsk or the White Sea, except by licence issued by the chief Russian delegate on the International Commission in agreement with the Admiralty.3. A staff of officers appointed by the Admiralty to deal with the arrival, unloading,    j loading, and despatch of steamers carrying Russian war material, should be stationed with the full consent of the Russian Government at Archangel, Alexandrovsk, and Vladivostock.4. The British Admiralty will be given a free hand to control the movements and
disposal of all mercantile shipping in the ports mentioned in paragraph 3, in so far as y such is necessary for the execution of their duties. All the facilities of these ports ^ shall be placed at the-disposal of the British Admiralty by the Russian port authorities who will be responsible for the provision of such labour as may be required.5. The loading of steamers on their return journey from White Sea ports and Alexandrovsk: should be under the control of the British Admiralty staff at those ports with whom the decision as to the port or ports to which they are to be consigned should rest in order that proper arrangements may be made for their being ready to take up fresh cargoes for further trips.0. That the Russian Government will at once increase the number of cranes, provide additional stores at Archangel, and also at once improve the port of Saroki.7. Any further conditions which the British Admiralty may consider it necessary to lay down with a view to ensuring the efficient execution of the transport service.(Signed)       E. WYLDBORE SMITH.A.
