SECRET.POSSIBILITY OF IMPORTING LABOUR FROM ITALY.Prime Minister,FROM information which. I picked np during my recent visit to Italy with you, it would appear that material relief in regard to the shortage of labour in this country could be obtained from Italy.2. At the moment when Italy broke off relations with Austria, there were from 300,000 to 500,000 Italians at work in Germany, in mines, &amp;c. The Italian Government found it impossible to withdraw these men without betraying the fact that they contemplated war with Austria, and now, of course, the Germans would not allow them to go. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that this is probably one of the reasons which weighs with the Italian Government against declaring war with Germany. But, from the point of view of this memorandum, the important point is that Italy, though, without doubt, most unwillingly, is, nevertheless, assisting the enemy&apos;s economic position very materially by means of these labourers. Having regard to Italy&apos;s great economic dependence on this country for coal, steel, wheat, &amp;c. a dependence which,they fully realise and admit-we could present a very strong case for similar assistance.3. There appears to be no doubt that there is ample labour to spare in Italy. Rome, as you saw for yourself, was fall of men, including many young men. At the present time Italy does not require to call Up more men for the Army. There are already sufficient men mobilised to provide reserves for all the units that can be equipped with artillery, machine guns, &amp;c. The Italian front is very restricted by its physical features, and, as you yourself have seen, there are masses of troops behind the front in barracks and billets, in reserve, and under -training. There is therefore a larger surplus reserve of man power than in soinevof the other Allied countries.4. Furthermore, Italy can dispose of the sort pi labour which we require. In the course of a private conversation with the Minister of Public Works, I was informed that the ports of Ancona and Venice are absolutely closed to merchant shipping, as the Adriatic is a no-man&apos;s water so far as mercantile traffic is concerned... The result is that the dockers of these two ports are out of work. Genoa will not have them, owing to trades union difficulties, and a considerable number could probably be obtained for service in England.   I understand that miners could be obtained from Sicily.5. There are, I understand, two difficulties in the way of carrying out this proposal, namely:  /(a.) The difficulty mentioned by the Italian Representatives at the Paris Conference to the effect that an amendment would be required in the Italian emigration laws, and that a time of war was not convenient for carrying out such changes.(6.) The difficulty with the trade unions at home.Neither of these difficulties ought to be insurmountable.6. With regard to the first, it must be remembered that the suggestion emanated from the French representatives. It is possible, however, that the Italian Govern-ment would be more willing to meet us in this respect than the French. No one who visited Italy with you could fail to be impressed by the tremendous admirationPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   April 1916.
felt for this country by the Italians,-nor with the confidence which they feel in our ability to carry the war to a successful conclusion. If it were put to them that this step was urgently required in the interests of the economic strength of the Allies as a whole, and of Italy in particular, since Italy makes so great a demand upon our economic resources, there is reason to believe that they would endeavour to meet our wishes. General Delme-Radcliffe, to whom I spoke on the subject privately, thought that it could probably be arranged.With regard to the second difficulty I have also a proposal to make. The Italian military authorities. themselves, as you saw, are employing a large amount of civilian labour on road-making and trench-making in rear of their armies. I ascertained that these civilian labourers are engaged in companies of a hundred for three months at a time. I understand they are under quasi-military discipline, and each hundred men has a sort of leader or foreman. It is suggested that they might be hrought to England on somewhat similar terms : that is to say, they would come as the employees of the British Government in groups of one hundred men for a limited period of service, say, three, four, or six months. If necessary, they could be employed entirely on the loading and unloading of military stores in the docks and railways or on cargoes for Italy, thus setting free civilian labour for other mercantile purposes. This should remove any misgivings that the trade unions might feel that these men would be allowed to settle in the country after the war and undercut their labour. The rates of pay. might be arranged in consultation with the trade unions, who should be given a guarantee that the Government would repatriate the Italians as soon as the normal supplies of labour were equal to the demand.M.
