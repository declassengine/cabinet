SECRET. G.-100.THE NAVAL POSITION IN REGARD TO OUR OVERSEA MILITARYFORCES.(Memorandum by the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty.)THIS question, which has reached a most acute stage should be looked at from two points of view, viz. : 1. The provision of the required number of ships of the mercantile marine. 2. The provision of escorting vessels for protection against attacks by submarines or surface vessels.In the&apos; early stages of the war the Navy and mercantile marine were responsible for the safe conduct and maintenance of less than 200,000 troops abroad.At the present time some two million and a quarter troops are being maintained overseas.Previous to the war the strength of the Fleet was regulated in accordance with the principle of maintaining a certain definite preponderance over the German Fleet, and no margin for the purpose of safeguarding military operations of such magnitude as are now being carried out was even contemplated.We commenced our military operations overseas without having undisputed command of the sea, and we have continued them and increased them without it.Our efficient modern Fleet is still watching and holding up the German Fleet, and our obsolete vessels are carrying out the immediate protection, outside Home Waters, of the military oversea forces, and everything which it is necessary to import in order to supply them.The mercantile fleet, though much depleted, has a heavier task than it had earlier in the war, owing to the increase in the Army abroad and to the needs of the Allies.We cannot continue to increase our commitments overseas indefinitely, having regard to the naval position (including that of the mercantile marine), without reaching a culminating point, beyond which further expansion is no longer possible.At the present time it is apparent to those who have the working of the arrange-ments that the culminating point has been reached.The Australian and New Zealand reinforcements and drafts come round the Cape to England. Usually they make the passage without convoy, but are met by destroyers off the Bay of Biscay and safeguarded into port.Approximately 12,000 men a month leave Australia and New Zealand.The presence of a German raider in the Atlantic has made it necessary to stop all sailings and introduce convoys.Eight transports full of troops are held up at Sierra Leone ; six more are due there by the 16 th December.H.M.S. &quot;Marmora&quot; will convoy six of these home; H.M.S. &quot;Kent&quot; will convoy the remainder to England. Four transports are heldfup in South Africa, and four are between New Zealand and South Africa. Only one man-of-war is available to bring these from the Cape to Sierra Leone, and she will not complete refit till the 27th December.Six transports are due to leave Australia between the 11th and 26th December ; no vessel will be available to convoy them from the Cape until late in January.Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1916.
Four large transports containing about 13,000 men are detained at Plymouth; three are bound for the Cape and two of these go on to Bombay. No convoy to the Cape is available until H.M.S. &quot; Marmora &quot;- reaches home.The Canadiau situation is good for the moment, as trooping on a large scale has stopped ; 54,902 troops were convoyed by cruisers across the Atlantic and landed in this country between the 1st October and the present date, being met by destroyers about 150 to 200 miles to the west of Ireland.The Mediterranean.-1. Drafts and Units to the Mediterranean.The number to be transported up to the 7th February is 55,000 men. Of these we shall transport by sea from this country, including the troops in two ships just requisitioned for trooping service to replace losses in the Mediterranean. 22,000. This leaves 33,000 to be carried from Marseilles.The War Office limitation for drafts proceeding overland via. Marseilles is 3,500 a week, they could thus only deal with 24,500 up to the 7th February.This leaves 8,500 for which provision is not made. This could be dealt with either by increasing the number sent overland via Marseilles (this is entirely a War Office question, as there is no difficulty in shipping the numbers from Marseilles to the Eastern Mediterranean) or additional ships could be taken up in this country and the numbers transported by sea.2. Supplies for Egypt and Salonica.(a.) Egypt. 25,000 tons will have to be taken, partly by liners, partly in additional requisitioned ships, and partly in troop transports. It is estimated that two store ships will have to be requisitioned in addition to those now on service.(6.) Salonica. Three ships will be required for this purpose; one has been provided, and two are being sought.3. Ordnance Stores and Ammunition for Egypt.These are being carried partly in troop transports, and it will probably be necessary to requisition one additional store ship.4. Railway Material, Egypt and Salonica.Part will be carried in troop transports, and part in an additional store transport which has already been allocated for the service.5. Egypt-Salonica Ferry Service.We have received no general complaint as to this. On reports received from the Principal Naval Transport Officer, Egypt, we have arranged some changes in the service, including the provision of two additional vessels, one of which is already on her way to Egypt.   Probably this will be found to have met any difficulties.It is undoubtedly true that the position both as regards embargos on sailings and the provision of additional tonnage is now more acute than it has ever been, and, so far as can be judged, especially in the latter respect, it will grow more serious still.There is no doubt that General Robertsons suggestion that the two divisions for Egypt should go from Salonica would prevent a very great strain on tonnage and escort arrangements, but if the War Committee decide that efforts should be made, notwith-standing, to carry and maintain a larger force, it cannot be said that it is impossible to obtain ships, but it is absolutely certain that they can only be obtained by restricting other services of national importance to ourselves and the Allies.
Protection of Shipping in the Mediterranean.The Mediterranean is a paradise for submarines mainly on account of its geographical features. Shipping routes cannot be much varied on this account, and when varied the new routes can soon be discovered.Up to the present the practice of escorting troopships has proved fairly successful, but its possibilities are limited, owing to the distances being great.The vessels for the purpose are too few in number, and are not particularly well adapted for the work. Owing to the long distances, destroyers cannot always carry sufficient fuel to keep up with fast steamers, and sloops cannot maintain more than 13 knots on a passage of three or four days.Gibraltar has five sloops, mainly used for escort work. The practice of sending troops overland to Marseilles has been adopted to save the additional risk between England and Gibraltar and the long passage from Gibraltar to Malta, but a certain number of transports are still obliged to use the Gibraltar Straits.Malta has eleven sloops and four destroyers and carries out escort work between Marseilles, Malta, and the western end of Crete, a distance of about 1,100 miles.Egypt has eleven sloops and escorts between Crete and Egyptian ports.The Eastern Mediterranean Squadron has eight sloops and twenty-nine destroyers, and safeguards the transports between the East and West ends of Crete and Salonica. These vessels have numerous other duties, such as offensive operations, watching the Dardanelles, and assisting the blockade of the Turkish, Bulgarian, and Grecian coasts. Owing to the numerous islands and the geographical conditions, the protection of the transports is a most difficult matter.All the destroyers are old, and have had very hard service since the war began, and they therefore require to be carefully &quot; nursed&quot; in order to preserve their efficiency.If more troopships use the Mediterranean routes the losses will unquestionably be . greater;  congestion will also increase owing to ships being detained to wait for escorts.More small cralt cannot possibly be provided for the Mediterranean unless they are taken from Home Waters, where the shipping losses are already considerable and the congestion great. &apos;^The submarine situation either in Home waters or the Mediterranean will certainly not improve for stjme months, as the number of submarines is increasing rapidly. New measures, even when they are devised, must take time before they become effective, as they largely depend on new material, which obviously cannot be obtained immediately.The delays to troop and store transports and shipping generally point to the fact that we are now stretching our naval resources beyond the limit of efficient working.We should try and carry out our present undertakings promptly and efficiently, and avoid committing ourselves to new oversea operations, which bring increased&quot; strain on naval and mercantile shipping. There is no question that, from a naval point of view, the most economical locality in which to employ the troops is in France.J. R.
