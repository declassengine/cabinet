Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   March 1916.SECRET. 1k-64.POWER TO RESTRICT LIGHTING UNDER TEE DEFENCE OF THEREALM ACT.Memorandum by Home Office.THE Memorandum of the Chief of the General Staff, dated the 3rd March, 191(1, should not be taken as conveying the suggestion that there has been in this matter any conflict between the military and civil authorities.2. It is true that there are concurrent powers. The competent military authority has local powers under regulation 12. The Home Office has general powers of a more extensive character under regulation 11. At first, the Naval and Military authorities issued orders for the restriction of lighting in their local areas, while the Home Office orders were confined to the Metropolitan Police District and one or two special areas. The Admiralty and War Office, however, found that the Naval and Military orders differed widely in their provisions in different localities, aud some important areas were left without orders, and it was therefore arranged that all Naval and Military orders should be withdrawn, and that the Home Secretary should deal with the matter by general orders on uniform lines settled by the three Departments in Conference. The orders then made (April 1915) have been gradually extended till they now cover all England except a few counties in the west; and every step has been settled by the Departments in consultation, both as to the areas to which the orders should apply and the nature of the restrictions imposed.3. There has been much discussion of details, especially as the Admiralty were until recently concerned in the orders, but no conflict of any sort has ever arisen between the Home Office and the War Office.4. The orders have been enforced by the police in places where troops are quartered as well as where there are none, and the instructions issued to the police and those issue! to the military authorities by the War Office have always been in harmony. Power is reserved in all cases for the military to give special directions&apos; in any emergency.5. The details to be settled in the orders include such matters as the conditions and degree of the darkening required in factories and other works, the number and description of lights to be carried by all sorts of vehicles down to handcarts, and the mode in which they are to be partially obscured, and the question (not yet settled) of the lights to be carried by drivers of cattle and sheep.6. It is not obvious what advantage would be gained by the proposed transfer, li would be very unfortunate if the result should be the making of military orders closely affecting the general public without previous consideration of the possibility or otherwise of their being carried out in practice and of their effects on production and transport. The making and enforcement of the orders involves much correspondence with police, local authorities, magistrates, and private persons, and if the making of the orders is undertaken by the military authorities, it should be on the condition that they undertake also their enforcement.H. S.March 8, 1916.printed at the foreign office by 0. r. harrison,-^8/3/1916.
