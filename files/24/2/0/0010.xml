Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1916.VERY SECRET. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;G.-56.SUMMARY OF NAVAL SITUATION.Memorandum by the First Sea Lord&apos; oe the Admiralty.THERE are two distinct situations as regards naval operations, home and foreign, though the two are mutually interdependent, as no reinforcement to the strength of either one can be carried out without a corresponding weakening of the other, except iu the case of the distribution of ships building and repairing when they come into a state of sea-going efficiency.They will be dealt with separately : (A.) Home&apos;Waters.There has been little change in the general situation during the last year.The enemy fleet remains in the shelter of its well-protected bases, confining its opera-lions to miuelaying, occasional short sweeps by its light craft, and to submarine warfare. Submarine warfare now includes minelaying from these craft, and is a most insidious method of attack-probably as destructive to merchant shipping as the direct attack by submarines, and is still more difficult to combat, because the submarine need not show its presence, even by its periscope, when in sight of other vessels whilst it is doing-its deadly work of minelaying. \Ye have, however, succeeded in destroying a number of. these vessels, and they appear to be generally of small displacement and radius of action, though there may be.some of the larger ones also fitted for mines, as small groups have been discovered at long distances from the German coasts. It is not known whether these were laid by large submarines or surface vessels.The Germans are evidently bent on commerce destruction in distant waters, and are sending out armed mercantile cruisers cleverly disguised to conceal their identity till they commence action against their prey.It may be stated, therefore, that German naval operations are now limited to minelaying, submarine attack on any type of vessel, and commerce destruction, supplemented by air raids in suitable weather.They have a very efficient system of watching their coasts by aircraft, and are thus generally able to gain information of any of our surface vessels, and even submarines, approaching their waters.The High Sea Fleet carries out most of its practices in the Baltic, with a very occasional cruise in the Heligoland Bight.Outside this bight the sea is thickly strewn with a barrier of mines, both German and English, and the estuaries can only be approached through swrept channels known solely to the Germans. Manoeuvring a fleet close outside Heligoland would be dangerous to them on account of the English minefields.The apparent inactivity of the German Fleet, which takes no risks now, even with its light cruisers, is probably based on a fixed policy of endeavouring to reduce the strength of the Home Fleet by mines, submarines, and wear and tear, until it has arrived in such, a, condition that a general engagement on its own terms at its own time may be accepted with the prospect of seriously crippling us.The mines and submarines have not succeeded in seriously reducing our strength. -Care has been taken to avoid undue wear and tear ; but the longer the war lasts&quot;the less efficient will our material become, and thus a prolongation of the war increases the enemy&apos;s chance of success in reducing our comparative efficiency.Another part of their strategy is to entice us to divide and disperse our forces, both generally and locally.    With regard to capital ships they must know they have little chance of succeeding in this, but as regards cruisers and light craft, it may [251] B
be stated they are succeeding admirably, and probably beyond their expectations of a year ago.Table (A) (appended) showing the strength of the German Fleet, as far as is known, is attached.   It does not include auxiliaries.To hold this fleet, and be always ready to engage it, is the duty of the Grand Fleet, now based in our northern waters. This fleet is stronger, ship for ship and class for class, than the German, but is organised in a different and more elastic pJan than the German Fleet, and it is increasing in size and power, as far as can be foreseen, at a greater rate than the German High Sea Fleet, in spite of losses arid of its constant state of readiness, which involves more wear and tear and more refitting than a fleet that has the initiative always in its hands.Outside our Home waters is the cruiser squadron of armed merchantmen, which is exercising economic pressure on our enemy. This squadron of weak fighting ships owes its continued immunity from destruction solely to the Grand Fleet; without the protection of the latter it could not last a week. It is most noteworthy that no attempt to attack it by fast well-armed cruisers has been made by the Germans. Such an attack miiiht well succeed in seriously reducing its numbers. This inaction on their part may make it appear as if the Germans were wanting in dash and initiative, unless the economic pressure is a myth, or the fixed policy of reserving their whole force for a final attempt preparatory to invasion is the reason. This latter appears the most probable. It is therefore all-important that, whatever may happen in distant waters, the Grand Fleet must be kept at sufficient strength and at full efficiency, in all classes of vessels, to meet the High Sea Fleet and stop invasion.To keep up its fighting efficiency it periodically puts to sea, and carries out tactical exercises as a whole.It also carries out very frequent sweeps of the North Sea, by squadrons and flotillas, to ascertain if any enemy ships are present, to show its presence, and to intercept mercantile traffic. These sweeps are not uneventful cruises, as mines and submarines and aircraft are frequently encountered.A detached cruiser squadron and flotilla in the south, and a monitor squadron based at Dover, have also some definite offensive operations near the enemy coast assigned to them as part of their duties.These sweeps, it must be admitted, have been somewhat interrupted during the winter, owing to the continuous series of gales that have been prevalent, and whose persistency has been almost phenomenal.This bad weather has also greatly interfered with the work of our oversea submarines, which are employed in the vicinity of the German coasts, watching enemy movements, and acting offensively against armed vessels. It has also probably had a similar deterrent effect on the enemy activity, especially in the matter of air raids.Coast Patrols.The sweeping of our estuaries and the patrolling of our coasts to prevent military raids on our south and east coasts, which was organised long before the war, has gradually developed into a patrol against submarines and mine-laying, and is now an organisation of large proportions, acting in all the waters round the Britis-h Isles. Its work is incessant and arduous, and is of the highest importance in clearing channels for mercantile and other vessels in the waters indiscriminately strewn with mines.Valuable vessels are. also escorted to protect them from submarine attack, and the watch and hunt for submarines in our estuaries, channels of trade, and exits from our naval bases, is -unceasing.The number of vessels in addition to torpedo craft employed on this service of auxiliary patrols, including mine-sweeping trawlers, in Home waters, is made up as follows: Yachts	66Trawlers	...    733Whalers	......      J5Motor launches	32Motor boats...	...     140Net drifters...	......    807Mine sweepers	......    141Paddle mine sweepers	......      271,961
The escort of troop transports across the channel to France, and to the ^Atlantic from Home waters, is carried out by flotillas of torpedo boats and destroyers. This escort is necessary on account of submarines, and has proved its efficiency by the very few losses that have occurred to transports in the Channel during the war. It is, however, a severe tax on our flotillas, since it diverts them from their designed fighting functions, while the abnormal wear and tear of this service decreases the number of those which are efficient.Gunnery, torpedo, and other practices are continually carried^ out by all vessels, and much experimental work is conducted to try improvements in various weapons of warfare and means of communications.The continual use of all kinds of arms and vessels necessitates a large amount of repair work ; and practically every shipyard in the British Isles takes a share in this work, on the lines of a scheme organised some years ago to meet such an eventuality.At present, an average of at least 300 vessels is under repair ; as fast as one is complete another takes her place. Battle cruisers and crinters are docked and repaired every six months, the battleships about every ten months, torpedo craft every four months, and other less important vessels as necessary.Table (D) (appended) shows the numbers and classes of vessels undei repair on the first day of each month for the last seven months.By these arrangements of repairing ships in rotation, all vessels carrying out operations in Home waters may be considered as efficient; but, at the same time, all squadrons are reduced from their paper strength by a proportion of the number absent from the squadron refitting. This system must apply, but to a very much less extent, to the enemy; since, if they intend making a demonstration in force, they would arrange that as few as possible were absent from their squadrons at their selected moment, and would start fully stored with fuel; whereas, it might occur that our fleet might, at the moment, have been carrying out exercises at sea, and require to replenish fuel. The organisation we have adopted, however, enables this to be done, if the squadrons are at their bases, in a very short time, but a loss of twenty-four hours or even more is possible from this course, if the enemy puts to sea at a very inopportune moment for us.This is a weak point, but, as*regards capital ships, their fuel capacity is so good that refuelling, except in extreme cases, might not be essential. The light craft, how-ever, whose endurance is only about three and a half days, would have to refuel, and and a loss from twelve to twenty-four hours would have to be accepted. Only a prodigious increase in the number could tide over this difficulty. Though wre are steadily increasing this number at the rate of five or six a month, which is the full output of our shipbuilding yards at present, we are not likely to reach the desired condition of doubling our numbers acting in conjunction with the Grand Fleet,Table -C) (appended) will show that, in spite of our great efforts to build torpedo-boat destroyers, the net quarterly additions are, comparatively, very disappointing. If the contract dates for the completion of new torpedo-boat destroyers could have been adhered to, our striking force could have reached 120 in August. The probable date is now December, a delay of four months^The number of destroyers in Home waters is roughly 180,.not counting those under repair, but of these less than half can be attached to tile Commander-in-Chief for fighting purposes, the remainder being required for local coast flotillas and escort of transports. The iocal coast flotillas consist of the older classes, many of which are now barely seaworthy, and only fit for work in estuaries and sheltered positions. It will be seen from the list of German destroyers that they joossess 121 organised for offensive work, and able to accompany the High Sea Fleet. They require but few for local coast defence work, owiug to the short length of their coast line, wdiich, compared with ours, is, roughly, 100 miles to 2,500; and in this connection, it is one of the greatest advantages they possess over us. It enables them to keep their forces concentrated in a small area, w-ell protected naturally and artificially, where they are ready to combine quickly to act against any raid or attack at any point, whereas concentration of our local flotillas to a threatened point must be a lengthy process.This applies to their patrols by aircraft.We are taking steps to improve our aircraft patrols, and by the summer hope to be in a much better position than we have been hitherto ; but we are far behind them m this respect, and the great length of our coast line necessitates a very large number of stations to enable the whole East Coast to be properly watched from the air.
(B.) Foreign.In the early stages of the war our squadrons in foreign waters were employed in hunting down enemy cruisers, escorting transports, and assisting the military operations against, the German colonies on the African coasts, and in the Western Pacific Ocean.The employment of our vessels against enemy cruisers was greatly restricted by their use as escorts, owing to troops having to be moved before enemy war ships had been dealt with ; this probably prolonged the existence of the German raiders on our commerce.When these raiders were exterminated, the greater proportion of our best cruisers were concentrated in Home waters. Events proved this course was for a time a safe one, as for practically a year no attempt has been made by the enemy to interfere with our ships overseas by surface vessels, but the submarine gradually replaced them near our coasts, and the use of these craft has steadily extended and is now in full swing in the Mediterranean.Recently, one or more German commerce destroyers have succeeded in reaching the Atlantic, in which we have always maintained some cruisers in case of this eventuality.   These are now being reinforced.The military operations on the East and West Coasts of Africa have employed a small number of old cruisers and small vessels, which have been used in blockading those coasts. The Red Sea patrol and operations in Mesopotamia and on the coast of Persia have also usefully employed some of our older and smaller vessels.During the first months of the war, naval operations in the Mediterranean were almost at a standstill. The French had complete command in those waters, with the exception of a small but powerful squadron watching the Dardanelles. When the attack on the Straits was decided on, it was necessary to reinforce this squadron by vessels carrying a powerful armament, and old battleships were usefully employed in the work. They did good execution at the outer forts and covered the landing of our troops. An advanced base was formed at Mudros, in the island of Lemnos, and smaller bases were also made in Tenedos and Imbros.The landing on the peninsula was made, but the advance failed, and the operations dragged on. The enemy submarines became more active; reinforcements had to be sent and protected en route, and the small Dardanelles squadron has gradually grown into a large Allied Fleet with all its attendant vessels.Italy joined in the war against Austria, and required reinforcements of all types of vessels to secure her navy from destruction by the Austrian Fleet. Our contingent consisted of 4 good battleships and (i excellent light cruisers, and these have been supplemented by submarines and also by drifters in large numbers to assist in defence against submarines, which have been very active in those waters. The French provided some submarines and destroyers, and their main battle fleet is a covering fleet for the Italians at the mouth of the Adriatic,Zones of operations were allotted to the three Powers. These have been since modified and more has come under our direction, as the French were unable to supply sufficient light craft to defend their zone against submarines though they still retain the command of the Mediterranean waters, except the Adriatic and the Northern iEgean.It must be noted that the French and Italian battle fleets are more than is necessary to meet the Austrian battle fleet; but, owing to the lack of sympathy and co-operation between these two nations, we are supplying a good battle squadron, with its complement of o,000 men, placed under the Italian Admiral, solely owing to this unfortunate lack ol: co-operation. One cannot help grudging this unnecessary dispersion of our forces, and also the detachment of a good cruiser squadron to the Adriatic, when our great shortage of cruisers in other waters is considered. Presumably, however, on diplomatic grounds, this arrangement must stand., The Salonica expedition was suddenly sprung on the fleet in October, and at the same time it was considered necessary to reinforce Egypt strongly and also the force in the Persian Gulf.Not counting the strain on our transport resources, these military expeditions demanded great exertions from our fleet. The evacuation of the peninsula followed, and the Greek situation was so serious that a small battle squadron w-as sent as a reinforcement to the Mgean Sea.   This has since returned.Operations at Marsa Matruh also showed that more naval assistance, besides that allotted to the Canal, was necessary in Egypt, and large reinforcements of small craft,
principally auxiliaries, have been sent to the Mediterranean entirely at the expense of the numbers in Home waters, which are now reduced to a strength below which it would not be safe to go.The French are doing their best to&quot; help in this matter, and are also sending small vessels to the Mediterranean ; but, as the transport routes in those waters exceed 3 000 miles in length, it is not possible to state definitely that they are effectively ouarded, nor are there sufficient suitable small craft obtainable (or probably even in existence) to thoroughly patrol and protect these Mediterranean routes from hostile submarines at the same time as those in Home waters.The evacuation of the troops from Muclros to Egypt will only relieve this situation in a slight degree, as the same waters will be occupied by our fighting vessels watching the Dardanelles, and the blockade of the Bulgarian and Turkish coasts will be continued. It will only relieve the constant stream of traffic between the islands and the peninsula, which has always been nearly immune from submarine attack.A squadron of bombarding vessels has to be held in readiness to support the flank of the army at Orphania, in the Salonica peninsula, and a fighting squadron to close the Dardanelles to the entrance or exit of any enemy vessels; both employ a large number of small craft to protect them against submarines.- In Egypt a strong squadron with heavy guns is now stationed solely for the defence of the Canal.The patrol of the Red Sea is maintained, and the situation in Persia demands the maintenance of a cruiser squadron of old vessels not fully efficient.The Mesopotamia campaign is assisted by a naval force, of old sloops, which are of little use on the high seas, and new river gunboats ; they employ a considerable force of trained personnel.   Naval aircraft are also employed.The numbers of river-work vessels are being increased as rapidly as possible ; owing to their non-seaworthy qualities, they have to be towed or sent in sections by freight to Abadan, where they are rebuilt as rapidly as the limited resources of those regions admit. They entail the employment of a considerable force of transports and personnel.Owing to the intrigues in the East Indies, it is not advisable to further reduce the naval forces in the East, and thepresence of German commerce raiders in the Atlantic has already raised feelings of anxiety in Australia, and will necessitate a withdrawal of ships now usefully employed further w^est to allay them though for the present no danger in Australasia can be foreseen.It may also be noted we are assisting the Russians in the Baltic with submarines, and protecting the White Sea &quot;and approaches, and that our forces there will have to be considerably increased in the spring.These Eastern military operations have, since their inception, been a continual drain on our naval resources, and to such an extent that the strength of the fleet in Home waters-especially in small craft- is increasing in a much less rapid manner than the numbers of new vessels added to the service would indicate. True, many of our old well-armed ships are most usefully employed in supporting the army abroad, and would only be acting as guard-ships if at home, and, with the monitors, are still available as reserves in case of necessity, or in case of military operations on the enemy coast in the North Sea.No objection is, therefore, seen to their present employment; but the case with cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and small craft is different. Their dispersion is a serious drain on the strength of our Home forces, so vital for the protection of trade, transports, and fighting vessels near our coasts against the increasing activity of the submarine ; and it may be definitely stated that no further depletion of those in Home waters can be accepted without serious risk.As regards cruisers this war, as all. previous naval w^ars recorded in history, has shown the vital importance of these craft; and we have felt, and are, apparently, again about to feel, the inadequate provision made for these useful vessels especially those of modern design though every seaworlhy vessel that can be termed a cruiser, besides forty armed merchantmen, are in commission and actively employed at sea.The principal causes of anxiety to the Admiralty are the decreasing rate of output in the building and repairing yards, owing to the labour question, the rapid wear of some types of boilers in light cruisers and destroyers, the shortage of cruisers, the dispersion of our small craft, due to the extensive troop movements in the.East and the presence of enemy submarines, and the lack of merchant tonnage.On the other hand, we may congratulate ourselves in the possession of a fleet which is in a very high state.of efficiencv. Keen for action, facing continual hardships [251] C
and monotony with no sign of complaint; in splendid physique, whose training in the stormy seas of the north prepares them for the day of battle in a manner practically unobtainable by our enemy. Under the circumstances we should have no fear for the future.The promptitude with which our calls on the merchant officers and seamen have been met has been invaluable. The wonderful facility with which they have learnt to carry out their new duties as part of a trained fighting force is extraordinary. The Allied nations owre them a deep debt of gratitude.II. 11 J.February 8, 1916.TABLE (A).-- February 1916.Daily Return.

Arrangements are in force whereby these guns are changed from ship to ship in order to afford the maximum protection possible through the danger zones. By this. system approximately 750 vessels receive armament.(d.) But 174 of these guns are only 6-pr., 3-pr., and 2-J-pr., which are easily outranged by the guns submarines now carry, and are perfectly useless on the trade routes (e.g., &quot; Clan MacTavish&quot;).(e.) A vast number of British merchant vessels, of slow speed and carrying important cargoes of food and supplies are at present unarmed, and are therefore at the mercy of any enemy submarine or commerce raider when outside the immediate vicinity of the patrols. A strong and energetic attack by powerful submarines, operating (as they easily can) at great distances from their Home bases, would paralyze supplies, and, failing defensive armament, effective repiy would be impossible.
In order to afford adequate protection by defensive armament to vessels liable to attack by enemy submarines or commerce raider at least another 2,000 guns are required.The calibre should, so far as possible, be 4-7-inch rather than 12-pr. The latter gun would be of little use against a raider, and it may fairly be assumed that the German submarine will in the future be more heavily armed than hitherto, in which case the 12-pr. will be of doubtful value for countering attack in areas of operations where range of visibility is great.At least 40 vessels owe their escape directly to their armament. It is well known tha^ submarines make a careful inspection of the vessel through the periscope before coming to the surface to attack, and there can be no doubt that in many more cases such attack has not been made owing to the presence of the gun.Of the 40 vessels mentioned, several have carried large bodies of troops. One 4&apos;7-inch alone saved two ships and over 2,000 men, and only in the cases of vessels armed with 3-pr. or 2^-pr. has the submarine made successful above water attacks.Gun&apos;s Crews.These were originally composed of marines trained in gunnerj^ Owing to the extension of the scheme, R.N.R. and R.F.R. men had to be taken.Arrangements are now in force whereby these men receive special gunnery training before being drafted, and they receive constant instruction while in Home Ports,RICHARD WEBB, D.T.D.February 10, 1916.TABLE (G).
