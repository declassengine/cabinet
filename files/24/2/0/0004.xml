Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.&apos; January 1916.SECRET.G-50.The supply of Rifles and Small Arms Ammunition to theRussian Army.NOTE PREPxlRED BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFFOR THE WAR COMMITTEE.(A.) Gbneeal Situation.1. Number of rifles now on the Main Front.IT is not possible to make an accurate estimate of the number of rifles Russia can put in the field at the present moment, as their authorities have been very secretive oil the subject.Major MacCaw put the total number of rifles on the front in the middle of October 1915 at 900,000, of which about 60,000 would be required for the cavalry, and says that this is Alexiefs own estimate.He also states that the Russian Commanders have been in the habit of keeping large reserves of rifles in their own hands which they do not account for in any returns. He further says that Alexief, who knew of this practice when he was a Commander himself, had a census taken on becoming Chief of the Staff, and discovered between 300,000 and 400,000 of these rifles ; thus making the total available between 1,200,000 and 1,300,000.A telegram from Colonel Knox, dated the 20th January, 1916, says that the official estimate of the number at the front is 1,398,000. which agrees substantially with Major MacCaw&apos;s figures.2. Number of Rifles and S.A.A. supplied, or to be supplied, from England,60,000 J apanese rifles with 18,000,000 rounds have been sent from Great Britain to Russia, via Archangel, during the last two months. It is hoped to be able to send another 30,000,000 rounds from existing stocks of components already in this country which only require to be assembled and sent off.Machinery is also being set up in England by the conversion of existing machinery, from which it is hoped to supply 15,000,000 in March, 25,000,000 in April, 45,000,000 in May and succeeding months. It was hoped to be able to borrow from Japan enough ammunition to bring this up to 45,000,000 monthly from the 1st January, but this has not succeeded.3. Number of Rifles and S.A.A. from other Sources.J apanese.There are understood to be in Russia about 400,000 serviceable Japanese rifles. 50,000 more were expected from Japan before the end of 1915, and another 130,000 during^ the course of 1916. Japan is also supplying 7,000,000 rounds a month for these rifles, which, combined with British contracts, should provide enough ammunition for all these Japanese rifles.[184] B
Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence!  January 1916.SECRET. i RG-50.The supply of Rifles and Small Arms Ammunition to theRussian Army.NOTE PREPARED BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFFOR THE WAR COMMITTEE.(A.) General Situation.1. Number of rifles now on the Main Front.IT is not possible to make an accurate estimate of the number of rifles Russia can put in the field at the present moment, as their authorities have been very secretive on the subject.Major MacCaw put the total number of rifles on the front in the middle of October 1915 at 900,000, of which about 60,000 would be required for the cavalry, and says that this is Alexiefs own estimate.He also states that the Russian Commanders have been in the habit of keeping large reserves of rifles in their own hands which they do not account for in any returns.

It was hoped to be able to borrow from Japan enough ammunition to bring this up to 45,000,000 monthly from the 1st January, but this has not succeeded.3. Number of Rifles and S.A.A. from other Sources.Japanese.There are understood to be in Russia about 400,000 serviceable Japanese rifles. 50,000 more were expected from Japan before the end of 1915, and another 130,000 during the course of 1916. Japan is also supplying 7,000,000 rounds a month for these rifles, which, combined with British contracts, should provide enough ammunition for all these Japanese rifles.[184] B
French Rifles.552,000 1&apos;1-mrn. rifles, mainly Gras, but  including something over 100,000 Kropatschek, are being supplied by France, together with 39,000 8-mm. Lebel rifles.Ammunition for these : 11 -mm.       ... 66,000,0008-mm.        ... ... ... ...      15,601,000The French Government can now supply : 11-mm.       ... ... 9,000,000 rounds a month.8-mm.....       ... 3,000,000    ,,The 8-mm. are thus provided for at a rate of 75 rounds per rifle per month.It is hoped by the end of February France will produce 18,000,000 11-mm. rounds a month, and General Desaleux hopes to increase this eventually to 36,000,000 rounds per month, but it is very doubtful if this is possible^Taking the 11-mm. rifles at 500,000, they would require 37,500,000 rounds a month, and if the production in France can be worked up to 27,000,000 rounds a month, which, from all available information, seems the maximum we can expect, there will still be a shortage of 9,000.000 rounds a month.General Ellershaw is considering a contract in the United States which it is hoped will work up from 150,000 to 250,000 rounds a day, 7,500,000 a month, which will very nearly give the estimated average of 75 rounds per rifle per rnensum.Vetterli Rifles.300,000 Vetterli rifles have been sent from Italy and shipped via Brest or St. Nazaire for Russia.   14,000,000 rounds have been sent with them. ,General Delme-Radcliffe hopes eventually to obtain another 200,000 rifles from Italy, of which 40,000 are hoped for in January, but all this is at present rather uncertain.There are three contracts for ammunition for Vetterli rifles two with the Bardalone Company in Italy, which are now working satisfactorily ; and one with the Brass Metal Manufacturing Company in America, which has not yet begun to produce any output.General Delme-Radcliffe hopes to despatch 10,000,000 rounds this month, and estimates the production of ammunition from Italy at 20,000,000 a month in February from the Bardalone contracts. He also hopes for another 8,500,000 this month from Italy. Over and above this, if the conversion of the present Italian rifle to a smaller calibre is successful, General Delme-Radcliffe hopes this will set free anything from 20,000,000 to 80,000,000 obsolete large calibre Vetterli cartridges, and machinery capable of turning this out at a rate of 10,000,000 per mensem.America.The following is a list of the rifles, machine guns, and small arm ammunition, &amp;c, ordered in America by the British Government on behalf of the Russian Government, the shipments of which, at any rate until the middle of the year, will have to be made via Vladivostock : .Rifles-2,300,000 Russian calibre. In addition, there are direct Russian contracts for 1,200,000 rifles.S.A.A.-1,000,000,000 rounds.    In addition, there is a direct Russian contract for 250,000,000 rounds.Colt Machine Guns 12,000 Russian calibre.Vickers Machine Guns-10,000 Russian calibre. Lewis Machine Gun 10,000.Note. -The.Lewis Machine Guns will be of British calibre, provided a sufficient quantity of small arm ammunition can be supplied. This question is under consideration.
In view of the uncertain attitude of political opinion in America, and of possible developments consequent on the approaching Presidential election, it seems advisable that steps should be taken at once to arrange for the storing in Canada of munitions manufactured in the United States. It is certain that before long the rate of output will exceed the rate at which munitions can be transported to Russia, and, if the proposed step is not taken, a considerable accumulation of stores in America will result.4. Estimated Russian Output.The latest information as to Russian output is contained in a telegram from Colonel Knox, dated the 20th January, which puts the monthly output for December at 85,000, for January at 100,000, February 100,000, March 150,000, and April 200,000. The output of Russian ammunition for December was 100,000,000 rounds, and it is hoped to maintain this, while increasing the output of Mannlicher ammunition to 20,000,000 per month.5. Estimate of rifles which will be in possession of Russian troops by thespring.Major MacCaw&apos;s estimate is given in Appendix I.From Colonel Knox&apos;s telegram of the 20th January the situation will be as follows at the end of April 1916 : Russian rifles now available    ..         ..         ., .. .. 1,398,000Russian output to end of April            ..          .. .. .. 550,000Japanese rifles for which ammunition will be available .. 250,000Mannlicher ditto     ..         ..         ..         .. .. ... 20.000Total   .. .. ..   2,218,000Colonel Knox states that these are the only natures of rifles which it is proposed to use on the main front. The French and Vetterli rifles will be employed on the lines of communication and to arm depot troops.(B.)-Transport of Munitions.The main difficulty to be met with now is in getting the rifles and ammunition into Russia. Normally ammunition from Europe goes in via Archangel, and from America via Vladivostock.It has been very difficult to obtain any eorrect information on the state of the Siberian Railway, but great congestion is reported at Vladivostock, although the American shipments have hardly begun to arrive. The meagre information which we have so far been able to obtain shows that, though the congestion at the port is bad, important cargoes, specially required by Government, can be got through comparatively easily. Large quantities of supplies and munitions are stated to have been side-tracked at numerous points, and to- have remained there for months, and though munitions can, if necessary, be sent through from one end of the line to the other, these side-tracked stores apparently are entirely forgotten, and never get any further. It is understood steps are being undertaken to remedy this.Archangel.Archangel is now entirely closed. A large number of ships are ice-bound in the White Sea. Twelve more, all with most important cargoes on board (see Appendix II), are lying off Alexandrovsk. There seems no likelihood that Archangel will be opened before May; moreover, reports from there tend to show that there is already enough cargo landed to keep the resources of the single railway line fully occupied for the next five or six months.Efforts are being made with the ice-breakers available to free the ships in the ice,, so as to enable them to reach either Archangel or Alexandrovsk. Further efforts are also being made to unload stores on to these ice-breakers in the hopes of getting them through, but a number of important cargoes, including stores of such vital necessity
as rifles, S.A.A., fuzes, and hand grenades, are lying off the shore, and are unable to get any further. The best chance of improving delivery seems to be to rapidly organise some effective form of sledge transport from Alexandrovsk via Kandalaksha^ to Uleaborg, Kayana, or Soroka. There are existing roads to all these rail-heads -which could be developed if energetic steps were taken immediately and the. necessary transport organised. Our information is to the effect that this is possible, and we have just sent out an officer to investigate and report upon the practicability of these routes and means of improving them.The Alexandrovsk-Kandalaksha Railway is said to be likely to be finished in March, but this sounds very doubtful.Meanwhile Major Hallward at Archangel is endeavouring to improve the existing sledge route from that place to Nyandoma, the present end of the broad-gauge line from Petrograd, so as to supplement the narrow-gauge rail from Archangel.Vladivostock.The Admiralty have already made arrangements for transporting 150,000 tons of munitions from America to Vladivostock by the end of June. This total is composed entirely of munitions ordered by the British Government on behalf of the Russian Government in America.In addition, there is an estimated total of about 300,000 tons ordered by the Russian Government direct, for a large portion of which British tonnage will be necessary. It is understood that the Russian Government may be able to arrange for about half of this 300,000 tons. The question of providing British tonnage for the remainder, and of organising and placing the transport of all the munitions ordered by Russia from America, whether carried by British or Russian ships, under one control, has been submitted by the Admiralty to the Cabinet. It is of great importance that the decision on these two points should be given without delay, as the shipments will soon be coming through in very large quantities, and confusion and delay may occur.A separate paper regarding the provision of guns and ammunition will be prepared for the War Committee as soon as certain further information on the subject has been obtained from Russia.War Office, January 20, 1916.* See map attached
