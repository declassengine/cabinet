SECRET. G.-55.DUTIES OF THE ROYAL NAVAL AIR SERVICE AND THE ROYALFLYING CORPS.Note by Major-General Sir D. Henderson, K.C.B., D.S.O., General OfficerCommanding Royal Flying Corps.ALTHOUGH the respective duties of the Naval and Military Air Services have, in certain limited aspects, been considered by conferences held between representatives of the Admiralty and the War Office, there has never been any general instruction as to the particular duties to be undertaken by each in war. Some of these respective duties have, of course, been accepted without discussion, such as the duties of the Naval Air Service with the Fleets and those of the Royal Flying Corps with the Expeditionary Force. Others, however, have been left vague. Home defence is now in process of settlement, but duties such as long-range offensive operations are being prepared for both Services, and there is grave possibility of duplication and consequent waste.There is only a limited amount of aeronautical material available for both Services, particularly with regard to the supply of engines. I do not anticipate serious difficulty in providing aeroplanes of suitable design and in sufficient quantity; but the question of high-powered engines is serious, and is at present chiefly affecting the Military Service. * ,On the outbreak of war an arrangement was made between the Director of Air Services at the Admiralty and the Director-General of Military Aeronautics, by which the Navy was given a preference with regard to high-powered engines, because of the necessity of providing for seaplanes, which, being heavier than land areoplanes, require more power to drive them. It was assumed that a similar preference would be given to the Army in respect of lighter and lower-powered engines. Early in the war, however, the Navy entered upon a very large programme of land aeroplanes, presumably for Home defence, and the Military authorities have had the greatest difficulty in providing engines for the expansion of the Royal Flying Corps, required to meet the requirements of the greatly increased Army. This has been especially the case with regard to the supplies available from France.Further, as the war progressed it became evident that increased power would be required for land aeroplanes. Designs for engines of increased power were adopted and placed with various firms immediately after war was declared, but the manufacture of these new designs has not yet reached the productive stage The Royal Flying Corps is now suffering from lack of suitable engines for its necessary daily work, while it is understood that the Admiralty is using a large number of the most suitable engines for land aeroplanes.I suggest, therefore, that the War Council be invited to consider the following points: 1. What are the immediate duties of the Royal NavalAir Service ? 2. What are the immediate duties of the Royal Flying Corps ? 3. What is the order of importance of these duties ?4. In view of these decisions, what is the best distribution of available material ?DAVID HENDERSON, Major-General, January 28, 1916. Commanding Royal Flying Corps.[228-5]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1916.
Since writing&apos;the above note; it has come to my knowledge that the Admiralty, on the 28th January, issued a letter to fourteen firms of aeroplane builders announcing a competition for large aeroplanes (not seaplanes). Three of these firms are contractors who, by agreement with the Admiralty, were allotted to the War Office for the period of the war. Three of the firms also are already employed by the War Office on work of a similar kind to that projected by the Admiralty, and the construction of their experimental machines is well advanced.Competition of this kind is bound to delay our programme seriously.D. H.February 4, 1916.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C R. HARBISON. 4/2/1916.
