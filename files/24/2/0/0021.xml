Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   March 1916.SECRET.G.-67.NOTE ON THE BLOCKADE OF THE NORTH SEA.(Prepared by the G.H.Q., French Army Staff, and communicated by the C.I.G.S.after the recent Allied Staff Conference.)Would it be possible from now onwards to lighten the economic blockade of Germany by restricting the importations into Holland and the Scandinavian countries ?THE inferiority of the Russian fleet as compared with the German fleet, and the impracticability for the Anglo-French fleet of penetrating to the Baltic, have made it impossible to establish a direct blockade of the German ports.The measures adopted by the Allies in an attempt to remedy this state of affairs and to hinder, without a blockade, the commerce and the revictualling of the enemy, have consequently been merely partial measures, and have been in part ineffective.The British Order in Council of the 11th March and the French decree of the 13th March, 1915, declared that all merchandise of enemy origin or destined for the enemy might be seized on board&quot; neutral vessels. These decrees have not been recognised as legal by the neutrals themselves, and in practice it has been easy to disguise the German origin and ultimate destination of goods, by the aid of agents, who were paid by results.Agreements have been made between England and France, on the one hand, and Holland and Denmark, on the other, with the object of establishing in these two countries Trusts (&quot;associations de negociants&quot;) which should be the sole recognised importers authorised to receive certain goods under the reservation of a clause regarding the non-re-exportation of these goods to Germany.The agreements have yielded some results, but owing to fraudulent action it has been possible frequently to violate them.It has not been possible to arrive at any definite agreement with either Norway or Sweden.Goods forwarded by postal packets, and the transmission of&apos; cheques, coupons, deeds, &amp;c, have up to the present time been respected.As a result of the weak methods employed against her during 1915, Germany has been able to a considerable extent to continue to export merchandise and securities, and thus to obtain money and credit from neutrals. She has even been able to import, at a high price it is true, the provisions and goods of which she stood most urgently in need.It is sufficient to cite the direct import of Scandinavian iron ore to Krupp&apos;s factories, which increased from 43,000 tons per month at the beginning of 1915, to 56,000 tons per month at the end of 1915 ; also the considerable increase in imports into Holland and the Scandinavian countries as compared with the normal consumption of those countries in the matter of cereals, maize, rice, preserves, oil-cakes, fats, cotton, rubber, condensed milk, coffee, tea, cocoa, &amp;c.The revictualling of the enemy in 1915 has, therefore, suffered a certain inconvenience ; it has not, however, been interrupted. If the material means at the disposal of the Allies do not permit of the establishment of a real and effective blockade, recourse could at any rate be had to the following measures: 1. A declaration on the part of all the Allies to the effect that they regard the Central Empires as an invested and besieged area. [415]
2. The application of the doctrine of continuous voyage, in both directions, by compelling the shipowner and the consignor to prove both origin and ultimate destination of the goods seized.3. To withhold import licences from neutral countries bordering on German)&apos;&apos;, except for such quantities of supplies and articles as are necessary for their own consumption and their own industries.4. To authorise the export of Allied products (English coal, for example) to neutral countries only on receipt of an undertaking on the part of these neutrals not to export their own indigenous products to Germany.5. To extend the contraband list so that it includes all goods, supplies, and instruments of exchange or credit useful to Germany; to include under the heading of Absolute Contraband all goods now under the heading of Conditional Contraband, and to abolish this last list.The adoption of these measures, which would certainly have the effect of diminishing the enemy&apos;s power of resistance and therefore of shortening the war, may give rise to objections on the part of neutrals.Only objections raised by the United States and by Sweden need, however, be taken iuto consideration, the other neutrals not being in a position to exert pressure on the Allies.Special precautions should be used in dealing with the United States on account of the services which they are rendering to the Allies. Thanks to the pro-Entente views of the American people, it seems possible, however, to obtain the United States acceptance of such commercial restrictions as are deemed necessary.Such care, however, is not necessary in dealing with Germanophile Sweden, which does not furnish us with indispensable supplies and which can do us no serious damage beyond the somewhat indefinite harm which her intervention might cause Russia. Strong action should be taken towards, and our rules imposed upon, this country. As she has no great primary interest in entering the struggle and as, in addition, she is very ill-prepared for Avar, we may be pretty certain that she will yield to our demands. If, however, this did not succeed, a declaration of war would give rise to a much easier situation and would make it possible to establish a strict blockade of the northern countries, from which the fear of offending Sweden alone has hitherto restrained us.To sum up : The economic struggle has not really 37et been undertaken; it is of urgent importance, however, that the Governments concerned should adopt the necessary measures without delay. There are no great difficulties to be overcome, if things are managed with skill towards the United States of America and firmness towards Scandinavia.March 21, 1916.printed at the foreign office bt c. r. harrison. -22/3/1916.
