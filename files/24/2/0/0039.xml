SECRET. G-85.A GENERAL REVIEW OF THE SITUATION IN ALL THEATRFS nw wao TOGETHER WITH A COMPARISON OF mraTMYHpSS -    0F THE ENTENTE AND OF THE CENTRAL POWERS   (G1748/158)Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.1. ON the 28th December, 191-5, the War Committee decided that, &quot; from the point of view of the British Empire, France and Flanders are the main theatres of operations.&quot; That decision, which the War Committee has not modified, has governed, and. still governs the Military policy in all theatres of war in which the British Empire is concerned.2. To begin with the secondary theatres : The mission of the force in Mesopotamia, as defined by the War Committee on 28th September, is to protect the Persian oilfields and pipe-line, to control the Basra vilayet, and deny hostile access to the Persian Gulf and Southern Persia; while the General Officer Commanding has been directed to continue to improve his river and railway communications, and to maintain as forward a position as can be made tactically secure in view of a possible future advance on Baghdad, which is, however, not at present contemplated.3. The latest reports received from General Maude indicate considerable improve-ment in the land and river communications and in the health of the troops. He anticipates that the Basra Nasiryeh line of railway will be completed before the end of November, and the Kurna Amara line about the end of this month, and that by the middle of December the force will be ready in all respects to meet any calls which may be made upon it. There is not at present any indication that the Turks are with-drawing troops from the Russian front for the purpose of taking the offensive in Mesopotamia, though it is as y*et too early to say that the enemy has not formed some such plan for the winter months. It seems, however, reasonably certain that we shall have time to complete the organization of our communications, and that General Maude will be in a position to meet any effort which the Turks can make against us. I hope, also, that in accordance with the instructions quoted above which he has just received he will be able to give material assistance in checkmating the German-Turkish propaganda in South-West Persia. The Commander-in-Chief in India is now visiting Mesopotamia, and a report from him on the general situation is awaited.4. In Egypt the cool weather season has begun and with it the period in which j active operations on a considerable scale are possible. I have impressed upon the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief the importance of winding up the operations oil his Western front at the earliest possible date with the object of releasing the considerable force which is now locked up there. The Senoussi is in difficulties and if discredited, and I hope that, even if the negotiations which are,now in progress with hirnj come to nothing, Sir A. Murray will before the end of this year be able to remove any danger to Egypt from the west. As regards the Eastern front, the policy of passive defence of the Canal is both extravagant in- men and encouraging to the enemy, but the possibility of extending operations into the Sinai Desert is dependent upon the construction of a railway for the maintenance of the troops. This is now being energetically pushed forward, and the railhead is expected to reach the extreme eastern limit of the Katia Oasis by the middle of this month. This will enable Sir A. Murray completely to bar the easiest line of approach to the Canal and to establish at Katia a base from which a further advance can be made, which it is hoped will give encouragement to the Sherif and to all the various elements in Syria which are discontented with Turkish rule.. There are at present no indications of a reinforcement for the Turkish troops in oyna or in the Sinai Peninsula, and no signs of more active preparations for another attempt against the Canal; but here, as in Mesopotamia, it is yet too early to say that the lurks will not make the attempt during the forthcoming favourable season. ... J*- - ne Allied forces at Salonika have succeededin carrying out their rdle of keeping the Bulgarian-Ger man forces, which were on the Greek frontier at the beginning of September, engaged.[1-37]        * BPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1916.
General Sarraifs operations on his left flank are meeting with a certain amount of success, but we cannot expect that he will achieve anything of much importance, especially so as the unfavourable season for operations is now fast approaching. The opposing forces are practically equal, consisting on either side of about 190,000 rifles with a slight preponderance of artillery in favour of the Entente forces, who have some 970 guns as against about 850 opposed to them. Further, as I have pointed out to the Committee on more than one occasion, the limitations of road and rail communications in this theatre must seriously hamper General Sarraifs movements. The line of railway on which he is largely dependent for the supply of his offensive force ends at Monastir, and I do not therefore think that he will be able to carry his operations far beyond that place, if as far. General Milne estimates that in order to defeat the Bulgarian forces on the Macedonian front decisively the Entente Army at Salonika should be reinforced by 15 divisions and a quantity of heavy artillery. Such a reinforcement is out of the question, even if on other grounds it were desirable, until the War Committee decide that for us the Balkan Theatre and not France is the main front. There is no satisfactory military alternative between the continuance of our efforts on approximately the present scale and making the Balkans the main theatre of war; on the other hand, the limited and unsatisfactory nature of the communications in Macedonia make it highly improbable that an army of the size necessary to obtain decisive results could operate successfully.In my judgment a decisive campaign against the enemy forces in the Balkans can only be conducted this winter from the Roumanian front. The advantages to be gained by such a campaign have already been placed before the Committee, and I need not repeat them here. I have discussed this matter with General Joffre and I find he is in general agreement with me, but we both feel that it mainly depends upon the degree of assistance that Russia is prepared to give to Roumania whether such an operation is practicable or not.It has just been decided by the War Committee, in response to the strong representations of the French and Russian Authorities, to send reinforcements amounting in all to about 39,000 rifles (which include a Division from the Western front), but this will take some weeks to carry out and even then cannot materially improve the situation on the Macedonian front, though it may perhaps tend to encourage the Russians and Roumanians to take more effective actions in Roumania and Transylvania. Bad strategy has never yet proved to be good policy, and I regret therefore that it should have been decided to send still another division to this theatre although I recognize the reasons which prompted the decision. In Macedonia, we shall remain, as for the last year, unnecessarily strong for the defence of Salonika the original rdle of the force and not nearly strong enough for decisive action against the opposing forces which may be brought against us. I regret the decision, not only because of the evil of dissemination of force, but because it brings us a step nearer to embarking on extensive operations in the Balkans where, in my opinion, decisive results are impossible.   Such a change of plan might well be fatal to us.6. The situation in German East Africa is that the enemy has everywhere been j driven south of the Central Railway, and that the ports along the whole coast have been !occupied, while his main forces are assembled in the difficult and unhealthy region of the Lower Rufiji.General Smuts&apos; advance has for the time beinp; carried him to the extreme limit to&apos; which his communications can be maintained, and he is at present engaged in organizing a fresh base at Dar-es-Salaam, and in preparing the Central Railway with a view to establishing fresh communications. This, together with the serious ravages which sickness has made among his troops, has forced a halt upon him, which naturally gives the enemy a breathing space for rest and reorganization.General Smuts now feels that it may not be possible for him to round up the enemy before the autumn rains set in, and in that case the campaign may drag on until the spring of the new year. In March last, in anticipation of the need of more native troops for the concluding phases of the campaign, steps were taken to extend the existing organization of the Kings African Rifles from 3 to 9 battalions; 7 of these are already in the field, and the remaining 2 and 4 others, making 13 in all, are in process of formation. Two battalions of West African troops have already been engaged in this theatre and are reported to have done good work ; 4 more leave West Africa on 5th November, which should reach General Smuts Detore the end of that month. I still hope, therefore, that it may be possible to relieve the greater part of the white formations about the end of this year and to leave the native troops to complete the campaign.
7. I have so frequently reviewed the operations on the &quot;Western front that it appears unnecessary for me to recapitulate all the results obtained by our offensive on the Somme, but there are certain aspects of these &apos; operations which demand further notice.Extracts from captured documents, which have recently been extensively quoted m the Press, have given rise, in some cases, to erroneous conclusions as to the German power of resistance. There is, however, abundant evidence to show that the^ enemy is experiencing difficulties in the Western Theatre owing to the fact that he is inferior to the Allies in numbers, in aircraft, in artillery, and, probably, to some extent also in the supply of ammunition.In a sustained offensive, such as we have been conducting since 1st July, this general inferiority causes difficulties which continually increase as one position after another is lost. Exhausted troops driven from positions of great strength, which they had spent many months in strengthening and which afforded adequate shelter, are compelled to dig new lines, only to lose each in turn in spite of the strictest orders that they are to be held at all costs, that no trench is, under any circumstances, to be voluntarily abandoned, and that it is the duty of every officer and man to fight to the last, however hopeless his position may be. Besides the discouraging effect of the loss of successive positions, the infantry, although they are told that our offensive is exhausted, find that our attacks are constantly renewed with fresh troops In the Somme fighting these disadvantages have been aggravated by the diminished support afforded to his infantry by the enemy&apos;s aircraft and artillery. The former have hardly ventured over our lines; while our airmen are not only continually hovering over the enemy&apos;s infantry who know that this is the prelude to an accurate bombardment but also are continually attacking them in their trenches and billets, or while marching on the roads. The artillery, owing to fear of capture, is unable to occupy forward positions, where it could render better support to the infantry and obtain greater facilities , for direct observation of fire. Its support is frequently lacking at a critical moment as, in order to prevent the guns falling into our hands, the batteries are compelled to change position in the middle of an attack Such changes of position necessitate registering on new targets which entails great loss of time while the guns themselves are also frequently silenced by hostile counter battery work, the superiority of which is due in its turn partly to supremacy in the air and partly to greater weight of metal. A further difficulty lies in the inevitable confusion of a continued retirement, the occupation of improvised positions, and the interruption of communications due to the cutting of telephone wires by hostile artillery, and to the fact that despatch riders and messengers are killed. The force acting on the defensive is besides always at a great-disadvantage owing to the fact that it never knows where the next attack will be made, and this leads to a general nervousness both on the part of the troops themselves and of the higher command. Signs of this are apparent in the German communiques which sometimes greatly exaggerate the strength of our attacks, or refer to the repulse of attacks which have never taken place, the fact being that in these cases the eneinys infantry, thinking an attack was intended, notified their artillery who put on their barrage fire, and this is afterwards represented as the repulse of a hostile attack which would have matured had these measures not been adopted.8. Evidence of all these difficulties is apparent in captured documents, and they bear a remarkable resemblance to the difficulties encountered by the British Army in the autumn and winter of 1914. They are the inevitable outcome of a prolonged period of defensive warfare, the strain of which is and always has been greater than that of a corresponding period of offensive warfare, provided the latter meets with a reasonable measure of success.This does not mean that the German Army is demoralized any more than the British Army was demoralized in November, 1914. In spite of the enemy&apos;s over-whelming superiority at that time our resistance did not collapse, nor is there any reason to think that his resistance will do so in the near future. In many respects he is in a more favourable position than that of the British Army in 1914, in that he is able to relieve divisions which have suffered heavily and can readily make good any wastage. In his case also a retirement does not involve military disaster as ours might have done in 1914. . As regards his prospects, however, he is in a worse position, as he has no great undeveloped resources as the British Army had then, and his increase in material at the present time bears no relation to our own. The result is that our relative superiority is growing greater every day.In order to reap the full benefits of this situation it is of vital importance that no, [1237] B 2
opportunity should be given to the enemy of recovering from the effects of our offensive. Any relaxation of pressure would enable him not only to create much stronger lines of defence but would also restore his morale and his powers of resistance which have been shaken by defeat. This course can alone prevent the transfer of a considerable number of troops to the East where their presence may, in existing circumstances, have a most serious effect on the military situation.9. The transfer of German forces from the Western to the Eastern front which has been going on for some months requires explanation, as the situation is complicated by the fact that the Germans have been bringing fresh formations into the fronts while this transfer has been going on. On the 1st June of this year the Germans had 169^ divisions in the field, they have now 197, or an increase of 27^ divisions. The distribution of these divisions between the Western and Eastern Theatres has been as follows : 	i 1st June.	1st July.	24th October.Western Theatre Eastern Theatre        ..	122 471	1191   . oil	127 70	1691	171	197Since, however, the greater majority of these new divisions have been formed by reducing the strength of existing divisions a fairer comparison of the relative strength on the two fronts at these three dates can be made when the distribution by battalions is examined. This is as follows : 				1st June.	1st July.	23rd October.Western Theatre       .. Eastern Theatre	1,373 600	1,334 639	1,299 821From this it will be seen first, that the number of battalions on the Western front is now only 35 less than in July notwithstanding the fact that there are now 182 more battalions on the Eastern front than there were then, and secondly that nearly two-thirds of the German forces are still in the West. It is also noteworthy that the only real successes which have been gained against Germans have b^en won in the west.10. On 12th September I laid before the War Committee my views as to the possible action of the Central Powers during the autumn and winter of 1916, and the War Committee agreed that the  proper course  to be followed in the present situation is to continue the offensive on the Western front with energy and with the full powers at the disposal of the French and of ourselves.   This is  therefore  the  policy  which  Sir  Douglas   Haig   is  now   pursuing,   and   the material resources at his disposal should enable him to continue it.   On the 1st January of this year we had in France 1,938 field guns and 785 howitzers and heavy guns.   We now have 3,060 field guns and 1,879 howitzers and heavy guns.   The average daily income of ammunition in France has increased from 30,000 rounds from the beginning of the year to 210,000 rounds at the present time.   It is anticipated that at the end of the present year we shall have over 2,000 howitzers and heavy guns in France.   The increase in machine-guns, trench mortars and other appliances of trench warfare has been on a corresponding scale.   The Committee will realise that it is mainly upon the number of guns and upon the supply of ammunition available that our power to extend our offensive depends.   At the present time the greater part of the enemy&apos;s front opposite to us, other than the battle front on the Somme, is held by divisions which have been exhausted by severe fighting and are compelled to hold wide stretches of the line in order to release troops to meet our attacks.   Our troops now raid the enemy&apos;s trenches on these parts of his front with great frequency and with trifling loss.   All the Commanders in France with whom I have spoken have agreed that had we now sufficient artillery and ammunition to allow us to attack on a wide front elsewhere than on the Somme we could break through the enemy&apos;s lines, and they look forward with the utmost confidence to the time when they will have the necessary guns.11. There remains, however, the all-important question of men, upon which the
Army Council desire me to lay special emphasis. At the present moment the army in France is about 80,000 below its establishment; not only should this deficiency be made good at the earliest possible moment, but it is vital that every effort should now be made to increase the strength of our force in France by next spring. The tendency of the French is to rely more and more upon us for the prosecution of the war upon the Western front, and it is therefore of the highest importance, not only that the forces we now have in France should be at full strength next year, but that they should be reinforced to the utmost extent of which the resources of the Empire will permit. We have now in England one more Australian Division and one Canadian Division which are preparing for France. It is possible that Canada may be able to provide still another, and that we may be able to obtain a brigade from South Africa. That is the limit of the reinforcements of which the Overseas, divisions are capable; any further divisions must come from the United Kingdom.12. The number of divisions which can be found and maintained from home depends firstly upon the number of men which His Majesty s Government decides can be provided for the Army, and secondly upon the problem of Home Defence. I have repeatedly urged upon the Committee my view that the decision of this war must come on land, and upon the main fronts, and I again urge that all demands for men for what-ever purpose, and that the whole policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, whether economical, Naval or Military, should be thoroughly reviewed from the point of view of making our land forces as strong as possible for that decision.13. There is another respect in which Naval policy affects the Military force which could be placed in France. The War Committee will remember that the basis of the problem of Home Defence is that the Admiralty is unable to undertake to interrupt hostile landing operations in less than from 24 to 28 hours after the hostile transports have been sighted from our shores. It has been calculated that in this period the enemy could land a force of 160,000 men, and it is to meet such a force that the troops now allocated to Home Defence are kept at home. Should it be possible for the Admiralty to make some redistribution of the Fleets which would reduce the time in which an enemy could land, or should they be able to state that the increase in strength and efficiency of our Fleets is such as to make the risk to the enemy of attempting invasion so great that no hostile force would undertake it, a very material reinforcement would be set free for France.14. Whatever conclusion may be reached upon the particular questions which I have here suggested should be investigated, I desire to press upon the Committee my considered opinion that it is vitaPto the successful conduct of the war, that our forces in France should be at the greatest possible strength by next spring, and that all the resources of the Empire, and all demands for men for whatever purpose, should be examined from that point of view.15. I attach a tabular statement showing the strengths of the Allied and enemy armies and their reserves, and in connection with it I must observe that the resources of the two groups of Powers cannot be evaluated by mere arithmetical calculation. The Central Powers have by their geographical position one outstanding advantage over the Entente, namely, that of operating on interior lines, and they have added to this advantage the still greater one of central control. They are consequently able to transfer troops and material as circumstances require from one theatre of operations to another, to work on a common plan and to subordinate all local interests to the general good. The Entente Powers, on the other hand, suffer from bad communications, which render it almost impossible to supply the deficiencies of the East  torn the surplus of the West, or to reinforce the diminishing armies of France from the vast reserves of men possessed by Russia. Further, none of the Entente Powers has been or is likely to be able to impose her will on the others to the same extent as Germany dominates her Allies. Though France and England are working with the utmost &quot;harmony in the West, there is no real co-operation between their operations and those of the. Italians, since there is no probability of any of the superabundant Italian troops behig transferred from the Italian frontiers to the French front. Owing to these causes the Entente cannot employ its superior numbers to the best advantage. The value of the individual reserves is also curiously uneven on the side of the Entente. The 4  million men by which the armies of the Entente exceed those of the Central Powers include nearly a million Roumanians, Belgians, Serbians and Portuguese, who possess little fighting value.lfl611 &amp;reater importance is it that they include nearly 5 million Russians, who are stdl but poorly provided with munitions.16. Victory is not merely a question of men, it is also one of leading and of armament, borne of our Allies, notably the Roumanians, have squandered their forces by bad
generalship. Others, more especially the Russians and Roumanians, are greatly deficient of war material. In spite of 2 years of effort the Western Powers have still been unable to provide Russia with a tithe of the heavy artillery which she requires, and the increasing difficulties of communications, owing to the approach of,winter and the increased activity of German submarines, make far distant the prospect of remedying this want. No lesson of this war is more obvious than that even the bravest troops can make little or no headway when opposed by hostile heavy artillery to which they cannot effectively reply. One result of the superior German artillery on the Eastern front is the moral superiority which the Germans have established there. The appearance of a German division exercises an effect out of all keeping with its intrinsic strength, and frequently during the last few months we have seen a rapid Russian advance and a hurried Austrian retreat stayed by the arrival of a handful of Germans, while the name of Falkenhayn and the- presence of five German divisions in Transylvania hove caused Roumania to think herself already beaten.Again, of the 9,000,000 reserves standing to the credit of the Entente, only a small proportion are immediately available. The 400,000 Roumanians, Belgians and Serbians are of little value ; the 6,500,000 Russians can only be used little by little to form new units, owing to lack of guns, rifles and equipment, while the 1,250,000 Italians seemed nailed to their own territories. The 2,000,000 Germans and the 800,000 Austrians are a much more liquid asset, and the disparity between the 9,000,000 reserves of the Allies and the 3,250,000 of the enemy is, therefore, far more apparent than real.17. As to the probable duration of the war, much depends on the staying power of Germany&apos;s Allies. During the Russian offensive in June and July, when vast numbers of Austrians were being captured, it looked as though the armies of the Dual Monarchy were almost beaten, and at the Chahtilly Conference last August the French were hope-ful that Austria might collapse during the present autumn. These anticipations were founded, as so many previous ones of the French have been, on an under-estimate of the strength and resources of Germany. Though Austria is, undoubtedly, feeling the strain, and though her reserves are diminishing, her army has been so strengthened by the admixture of German troops and by German leadership that there is no present prospect of an early debacle. Her morale is being raised by the successes obtained over Roumania and the slackening off of the fighting winch must necessarily occur on the Eastern front during the winter will afford an opportunity for resting and re-forming her tired divisions.As regards Turkey, there are signs of exhaustion. The recent reorganization of one of her armies in the Caucasus, which has resulted in 12 or 13 divisions being remodelled into a similar number of regiments, seems to point to a shortage of men. The employ-ment in European theatres of 6 divisions, and the absorption in the Caucasus armies of other divisions from the forces held intact for nearly a year as a strategic reserve, must detrimentally affect the power of Turkey to conduct vigorous operations on her Eastern frontiers next spring. There is, therefore, a hope that the Russians may then be in a position to achieve important successes m the Caucasus, and should they be able to reach the Tigris at Mosul, or to advance through Diarbekr to the Baghdad Railway, they would make the maintenance of a Turkish&apos; army in Mesopotamia and Persia difficult, if not wholly impossible.Bulgaria, owing to the wars of 1912 and 1913, has not the reserve personnel to meet the wastage of a protracted offensive, and she may desire to conserve as far as possible her male population, so that when peace comes she may be able to make her influence felt in the Balkans, At the same time it must not be expected that her armies, under Mackensen&apos;s command, will offer other than a stout resistance to any advance into her country, and her reserves are sufficient to supply all probable wastage for some months to come.18. As regards Germany, herself, she is fighting with undiminished vigour. In spite of the great efforts which she has had to make in the Western Theatre, both at Verdun and on the Somme, she has succeeded in retrieving what at one time appeared to be a very critical situation south of the Pinsk Marshes. During the last three months she has organized 27 new divisions, and has increased her fighting effectives by some 300,000 men. In so doing she has drawn deeply on her reserves, and&apos; her justification for this is that she is probably now throwing in her full weight with the object of obtain-ing a favourable conclusion to the war by or before next spring. But as she still has from 1^- to 2 million men available, it is clear that she is in a position to continue the war for a period the duration of which cannot yet be estimated. Documents captured during the recent fighting inculcate the need for economy in the expenditure of ammu-nition, but this does not prove serious shortage, or that it is due to other causes than the increase of artillery which has accompanied the formation of the new divisions and
the obvious necessity of exercising due economy. From such information as is available there would seem to be no reason to anticipate any reduction of the output of munitions in Germany in the immediate future, while the lessening of the intensity of operations during the winter will enable a reserve to be built up which may permit of more men being combed out of industries when need for them grows urgent in the coming year. It is further pqssible that even more men may be released by an extension of the employment of Poles and prisoners of war. The economic condition of Germany is, however, likely to become serious within the next six months. The harvest has not been so good as was at first supposed, and the shortage of potatoes, which is especially marked, will be much felt both by the poorer classes, for whom they form the principal article of food, and also by the breeders of live-stock. Milk, butter and fats of all kinds are deficient, and there is a great dearth of lubricating oils and rubber.   It is: therefore to be hoped that the closing of E,oumania, from whom Germany drew large quantities of grain and oil during the last year, and the increasing stringency of the blockade, may render the conditions of life in Germany almost intolerable during the coming spring. Unfortunately we are not certain that Roumania will continue to be closed, and in any case it would be over-sanguine to expect that the intensity of the economic stress which Germany is likely to experience will ever compel her Government to an unconditional surrender.19. My general conclusion is that there are so many unknown and incalculable factors in the problem, and that the fortunes of the Central Powers are so closelyinterwoven one with the other, and are also so dependent on those of their adversaries, that any attempt to predict what is called the end of the war would be quite valueless. Indeed it might be highly dangerous, since it would probably tend to create a halting and vacillating attitude on our part towards those measures which are essential to the vigorous and successful execution of the policy which compelled us to enter the war. All that can be said, or need be said, at present is that the enemy&apos;s military power is far from being broken, and that, unless the Allies go back on their policy, he will certainly fight to the last rather than agree to such terms as the Entente Powers are prepared to give.20. In order to ensure complete victory we must, in my considered opinion, continue to develop to the full all our offensive and defensive resources ; we must have the strictest blockade of the.enemy&apos;s coasts ; the utmost assistance which the Navy can give to the Army in Home Defence, so that the greatest possible number of troops may be placed in the field ; we must make available for the Army all men fit for military service who can by any expedient be released; and having got the men we must place them where they can best make their weight felt: there must be no mistakes in our grand strategy. Finally, we must expect, and at once prepare for, harder and more protracted fighting and a much greater strain on our general resources than any.yet experienced before we can wring from the enemy that peace which we have said we mean to have. It remains for the various Departments concerned, under the instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government, cordially and resolutely to take immediately the action required to meet these demands.W. R.
