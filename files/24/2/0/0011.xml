Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1916;.SECRET..NAVAL POLICY.Note by the Prime Minister.THE following points are suggested by the proceedings at the recent meeting of the War Committee, which was attended by Admiral Jellicoe : 1. The Grand Fleet is perilously deficient in destroyers, mine-sweepers, and light cruisers.2. The Tables prepared by the Admiralty show that the Allied navies have an overwhelming superiority in destroyers and light cruisers over the combined enemy navies.3. The question of distribution in the case of all three classes of craft ia) as between the Allied fleets, yb) in our own, requires urgent consideration in view of the vital importance of the safety and efficiency of the Grand Fleet.4. For the purpose of 3 (a),*a conference between the Admiralties or Admirals of the Allied fleets should be held without delay, at which we ought to claim the predominant voice.5. Construction should be accelerated by the immediate recall from the front of fitters and other classes of skilled labour.H. H. A.February 22, 1916.1&apos;RIKTED AT THE FOREIGK OFFICE BY C. E.  HARRISON. -23/2/1916.
