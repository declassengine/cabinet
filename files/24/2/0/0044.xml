November 1916.SECRET.G.-90. k;&apos;THE ECONOMIC POSITION OF GERMANY.Memorandum by the War Trade Intelligence Department. Lord Robert Cecil.WE agree with Mr. Max Mulder that all estimates of Germany&apos;s present economic position must be founded on insufficient data. We are not convinced that Germany&apos;s official statistics of an economic character are systematically falsified.We believe that the end of the war will find the leading German industries, except the coal, iron, and steel industries, thoroughly disorganised and embarrassed by the want of raw materials and of liquid capital. We do not see how any of the schemes which have been broached for financing and reorganising German industry after the war can avert a commercial and industrial crisis of the severest description, and we believe that the effects of this crisis will be felt for many years.Rut we agree with Mr. Max Muller that hitherto the German War Industries have obtained the necessary raw materials to satisfy the requirements of the General Staff. We are not clear that the war industries will be able to continue working at their present rate of output. The recent restrictions of coal exports and iron and steel exports show that the strain upon the existing supplies of labour, plant, and raw material is becoming insupportable in certain of these industries.We agree with Mr. Max Muller in reckoning among the most serious consequences of the blockade : (a.) The paralysis of German merchant shipping.(6.) The stoppage of imports of raw materials (wool, cotton fibres), textile industries.(c.) The restrictions of supplies of imported grain, oil, and fats for human consumption.We would emphasise a fourth consequence of the blockade, which seems to us almost as important, viz. : (d.) The progressive diminution of German supplies.On this subject a special memorandum (A) is attached, and we desire to call attention to the final paragraphs, in which the writer has stated his conclusions.We venture to disagree from the opinion that the conquest of Roumania by the Central Powers would upset all previous calculations as to the food supplies of Germany. Writing at short notice we have not been able to examine the question of Roumania&apos;s live stock, but we annex a special memorandum (B) on Roumanian grain supplies, in which we give reasons for thinking that these would be wholly inadequate to relieve the German fodder situation, though we believe that they would be mainly used to ameliorate it.- &apos; (A.) &apos; rGerman Live Stock, October 1916.Before the war Germany produced from 94 per cent, to 96 per cent, of her own meat supply, but to achieve this result she required nearly 7^ million tons of fodder-j corn and fodder-stuffs imported or made from imported raw materials. sOwing to the demands of the army, the meat consumption of Germany has not been decreased by the rationing system to anything like the extent which the deficit, [1224j &apos; &quot; B
of imported fodder would make desirable. In fact, it was officially announced in June last that the utmost efforts of the Imperial Meat Office had only reduced the slaughtering of horned cattle to the normal peace rate.The shortage of fodder became acute in the winter of 1915-1916. Many substitutes were tried, especially Compressed straw-fodder, of which one million tons were expected to be placed on the market in 1916; but none of these substitutes appear to have been successful. Then winter sugar-beet and potatoes were used to supplement the fodder supplies, but in the approaching winter the use of sugar-beet, refined sugar, and potatoes for fodder will be all but absolutely prohibited.The shortage of fodder has been accentuated by the efforts of the Government to bring back the herds of live stock to the pre-war level, from which they declined in 1914 and 1915 owing to the panic-stricken action on the part of the farmers who feared a fodder famine. Since the autumn of 1915 the Imperial Government has been working to increase the numbers of pigs and horned cattle, as, for instance, by restrictions on slaughter, by introducing meatless days, and by setting up an Imperial Meat Office. In and after April 1916 there Avas in existence a drastic control of - slaughtering and a meat-ticket system to re-enforce this control. By June 1916 it could be officially announced that the consumption both of the military and of the civilian population had been reduced to a minimum. Since then a uniform meat ration for the whole country of 250 grammes per week has been introduced, not with the idea of diminishing the quantities of meat distributed, but to secure uniform and equitable treatment of consumers. At present, on the admission of the War Pood Minister, this ration is not everywhere obtainable.The recovery of the live stock herds in 1916 has been remarkable.3. Pigs. Between the 15th April and the 1st September, 1916, the number of pigs increased from 13 to 17 million (the numbers in 1914 were 25 million).2. Horned Cattle. In the same period the number of horned cattle increased from 19*9 million to 20&apos;3 million (the numbers on the 1st December, 1914, were 21*8 million).But naturally the herds, both of pigs and of cattle, contain at present an abnormal percentage of young stock which is economically less valuable than the old stock, and the stock of all ages is underfed. - These two points were clearly stated by the Prussian Minister of Agriculture on the 13th May, 1916, and were repeated by the Wrar Food Minister on the 5th October. As to the condition of the stock, the War Food Minister said on the 25th June &quot; the present shortage of meat is due to the almost total fodder famine.   The animals must literally have starved through the winter.&quot;The milk and fat supplies tell the same tale.   The milk supply has been very bad all the summer, and has now reached such a low pitch that persons above six years of age, except invalids and mothers, have been cut off from the use of unskimmed milk. For many weeks the gutter and margarine ration has been about 90 grammes per week -in most towns.Conclusions.1. Numerically the German live stock census shows better results than could have been anticipated.2. The distribution of ages, and still more the condition of the animals, are bad. The stock is therefore not capable of yielding, without undue depletion, anything like so great a yield of meat as might be expected from the census.3. The numbers are still below normal, but the slaughtering of horned cattle seems to continue at the old rate, though the slaughtering of pigs has apparently diminished.4i. Fodder shortage may make it necessary to reduce the stock in any case. The ^resent stock cannot be maintained in good condition with the existing supplies of udder, and it is quite possible that the stocks will have to be thinned in the course of he winter.5. The German supplies of meat may be better regulated in 1917 than they were n 1916, but are not likely to be more ample, and may easily become considerably worse.
Roumanian Grain Stores.The object of this memorandum is to investigate two questions1. What supplies of Roumanian cereals would be at the disposal of the CentralPowers if they succeed in overrunning Roumania. 2. How far the German situation as to food and fodder would be modified by theacquisition of these grain stores.(A.) The,chief cereal crops of Roumania in 1914 and 1915 were as follows :.-Commodity.Wheat Maize Barley OatsRyeTotal1914.1915.Tons. 1,260,000 2,782,000 i 536,600 367,400 49,7004,995,700Tons. 2,436,000 2,500,000 : 632,100434,400 74&apos;,4006,076,900(Figures from Foreign Office Contraband No. 141416, revised from M.A. 5234.)Taking the average of these two years, we should estimate the harvest for 1916 at 5f million tons. According to trade reports it seems to have been a fair, but not more than a fair, harvest, including 2 million tons of wheat.In ordinary times the annual exports of cereals, from Roumania vary from million to 4 million, according to the state of the harvest. The extent to which the war has interfered with Roumanian grain exports may be seen from the figures of the last six years : 1911 (..;&apos;)(1912 19131914 19151916 (5 months)Roumanian Grain Exports, 1911-1916.-(Average for these three years 3,119,723 tons.)Tons..3,862,626 2,786,653. 2,809,8901,955,387 691,329 1,135,000, The accumulation of stocks in Rpumania has not: been quite-so rapid .as one might expect from these figures. In 1911, when the total harvest was about 61 million tons, the exports were about 3,800,000 tons; leaving a balance for domestic consumption of about 2,700,000 tons/ Domestic consumption. ;in 1915 was: slightly above this level, although the harvest of 191.5 was materially smaller than, that of 1911. In 1915 meat and some other foodstuffs were scarce and dear in - Roumania, and export was difficult; consequently there was temptation to the small cultivators to consume.a relatively large proportion of their stocks. From the following figures it would seem that about 2,728,000 tons were reserved for domestic consumption in 1915:-Visible reserves of cereals, January 1, 1915 Harvest of 1915        .. ..Giving a total of    ...      : &apos;..

Purchases for home,consumption madejffom ^visible reserves in 1915. (o.) Storage by.small cultivators for tneir own consumption. [1*241 * -      B2
Notwithstanding this liberal scale for domestic consumption, Roumania started the year 1916 with heavy grain reserves. These were diminished in the first eight months of the war by : (a.) Purchases for foreign account.(6.) Purchases for domestic consumption.A Bussian report, dated the 17th June, gives the exports actually effected in the first five months of the year as 1,135,000 tons. Purchases amounting to 800,000 tons had been made for the account of Great Britain, but the grain so purchased naturally remained in the country.We do not know what quantities of grain were exported in June and July to the Central Empires&quot;, but the great flow of exports from Roumania occurred in the months February to May.How much of the visible reserves of 1st January, 1916, were consumed by Roumanians in.the next eight months can only be approximately measured, but we do not believe that the drain from this purpose has been very great. There are in Roumania over 1 million small farmers and peasant cultivators, and nearly 4,500 large proprietors. We may take it for granted that they and their families and dependents, who make up the larger part of the population, are chiefly maintained out of private stocks. The urban population appears to be less than 1 million souls out of a total population of 1\ million; and their share of the total consumption of cereals would not be more than one-seventh, i.e.. a little less than 400,000 tons per annum, or in eight months 267,000 tons. But, to be on the safe, side, we may allow for the possibility that another million souls in the country (village tradesmen, artisans, &amp;c.) are also compelled to buy their grain. On this assumption the purchases for home consumption out of the visible reserves would amount to 534,000 tons in the first eight months of 1916.We thus arrive at the following balance sheet: Tons.Visible reserves on January 1, 1916       .. .. ..      3,694,000Less exports (ascertained)       .. ,. ... .. ..      1,135,000Less domestic (consumption estimated)   .. .. .. ..        534,000Giving a balance at the end of August 1916 .. ..      2,025,000We have already estimated the harvest for 1916 at 5-1 million tons; of this quantity at least 2 million tons will have been absorbed in the private stocks of the cultivators.   There remains : Tons.(a.) Visible reserve from the new harvest of        .. .. ..       3,500,000(5.) Visible reserve from the old harvest of .. .. ..      2,000,000Giving a total reserve of .. .. .. ..      5,500,000The greater part of this quantity could be taken by a conqueror. Only about 800,000 tons would be;needed for1 the urban and industrial and commercial population; and a conqueror might well decide to: leave these classes to negotiate for a share of the private stocks of the agricultural population on the ground that these stocks are in excess of the bare needs of their owners. Let us, however, suppose the conqueror to spare 500,000 tons to the urban and industrial classes. He would still have 5j000;000 tons at his disposal.This stock would mainly consist of wheat and maize. These two grains formed 80 per cent, of the total harvests of 1914 and 1915; they formed about 79 per cent, of the grain exports in 1911, and almost 90 per cent, of the exports in 1912. We may therefore safely assume that about 4,000,000 tons out of the disposable Roumanian reserves of 5,000,000 tons will be wheat and maize.(B.)--Let us now look at Germany&apos;s pre-war imports of the cereals which Roumania produces.Net German Imports of Various Cereals.Commodity.		1911.	1912.	1913.

Eor instance, Germany would receive from Roumania her normal annual import of wheat, and about double her normal annual import of maize. But, as we shall see, Germany is more in need of fodder than q  bread-stuffs; and in respect of fodder she would find the Roumanian imports entirely insufficient for her needs, because there are other imported fodder-stuffs besides maize upon which Germany is dependent.But it is obviously impossible for Germany to monopolise the spoils of Roumania which, if they are obtained, will have been obtained very largely by the efforts of Austro-Hungarian troops. Under the purchasing contract of March 1916 Germany and Austria-Hungary share their Roumanian purchases in the proportion of 60 per cent, and 40 per cent. We may expect that this proportion would be maintained in dividing the spoils of conquest. Upon this principle the shares obtained would be roughly as follows : 	Commodity.	Germany.	Austria.	Wheat Maize  .. Other cereals	Tons. 1,200,000 1,200,000 600,000	Tons. 800,000 8.0.0,000 400,000Thus Germany would only obtain 60 per cent, of her normal annual import of wheat. The supplies of maize and other cereals allotted to her would be ludicrously inadequate to make good her needs of fodder-stuffs.As long ago as the &apos;22nd January, 1916, when the news of the British wheat purchase in Roumania first reached Germany, the &quot; Cologne Gazette&quot; pointed out that Roumanian maize was much more important to Germany than Roumanian wheat. In 1913 the German imports of maize, barley, bran, and oil-cake amounted to 6 million tons. A recently published monograph, which., appears to be based on careful investigation (Hoesch, &quot; Die Wirtschaftlichen Erage der Zeit,&quot; Berlin, 1916), estimates that Germany at present requires to import, even when the harvest of fodder-stuffs is normal, the following quantities : Tons.Fodder-corn, bran, oil-cake, &amp;c. ., .. .. ..      6,418,272Kaw materials which will suffice to make a quantity of oil-cakeamounting to      .. .. .. .. .. **      1,000,000
This year the conditions are not normal. The harvest of oats and barley is indeed said to be good; but last year it was abnormally bad (8^ million tons as against 12 million tons in 1914, and 13,400,000 tons in 1913); consequently there are no reserves of oats and barley left over from the harvest of 1915. Sugar fodder, which was largely used in the winter of 1915-1916, will no longer be available, owing to the shortness of the beet-sugar crop. Already sugar, which had been denatured for fodder purposes, is being washed and purified to be used for human consumption. The latest reports indicate that the potato crop of October 1916 is disappointing, and the use of potatoes as fodder has been practically prohibited. It would be hazardous to give numerical estimates of the deficits of sugar fodder and potato fodder, but they will be a considerable factor in the situation. The difference between a good and a bad potato crop in Germany is as much as 20 million tons ; and a shortage of the potato crop under present conditions is an appalling catastrophe to the German nation. We may be certain that even 7 or 8 million tons of imported fodder-corn would be quite insufficient to save the fodder situation at present existing in Germany ; but the maximum amount of maize and other fodder-corn, which Germany can hope to obtain for herself from Roumania, is, as we have seen, about 1,800,000 tons.Summary.The following conclusions seem to be warranted by the evidence which we have examined : 1. If completely successful in the present Roumanian campaign the Central Powers might get possession of 5 million tons of cereals; and Germany&apos;s share would probably be 3 million tons.2. Germahy&apos;s quota would include about 1,200,000 tons of wheat and 1,800,000 tons of maize and other fodder-corn.3. This quantity of wheat would to some extent improve the bread situation. It would mean an addition of about 8-1 per cent, to the existing bread-corn stocks.4. But 1,800,000 tons of fodder-corn would be a very little relief to the German fodder situation, which is so desperate that not improbably the authorities would use the Roumanian wheat to replace inferior corn and potatoes at present used for making bread, in order that these may be utilised as fodder. Supposing this course to be taken, the bread ration would remain at its present low level of quantity, though the quality would be somewhat improved. The fodder situation would become better, but at the best Germany would still only receive about 50 per cent, of the quantities of fodder which are urgently required to maintain her present herds of live stock in good condition.October 30, 1916.peinted at the foreign office bt c.
