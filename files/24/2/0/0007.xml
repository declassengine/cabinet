Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1916.SECRET. hi :-- (d0-53.THE SUPPLY OF GUNS, HOWITZERS, AND ARTILLERY AMMUNITIONTO THE RUSSIAN ARMY.Note prepared by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff for theWar Committee.THE following statement has been drawn up in accordance with the concluding paragraph of Note G-50, dated the 20th January, 1916 : Supply of Guns and Howitzers.1. In the above-mentioned paper it was estimated that by the 1st May, 1916 Russia would be able to put about 2,000,000. rifles in the field. That number &quot;may be taken as sufficient to bring up to full strength 120 -divisions and 30 cavalry divisions, the cadres of which are now on the main front. Colonel Knox reports that the Russian estimate of artillery requirements * for a force of this size is approximately the following : 3-inch field guDS   ..3-inch mountain guns 4-8-inch howitzers (or corresponding type) 4-2-inch guns6-inch guns .&apos;.   .6-inch howitzers8-inch howitzers    .. 12-inch howitzers    .. .. ..5,634 940 720 24056 480 25081On the 1st January there were in the field with the Russian Army: 3-inch guns.. 3-inch mountain guns 4-8-inch howitzers 4-2-inch guns 6-inch gnns. 6-inch howitzers3,090 262 360 96 9141In addition to the above, there are guns of the following natures in the field at the present time : 4-inch guns (Japan)  .. 24-cm. guns (Japan) 20-cm. howitzers (Japan) 24-cm. mortars (Japan) 28-cm. howitzers (Japan) 11-inch guns (French) ..1210 (on order, 4).4 *34 (on order, 15). 27 4According to information just obtained by Colonel Knox, the following number of guns can be produced in Russia by the 1st May : 3-inch guns 3-inch mountain guns 4-8-inch howitzers   ., 4-2-inch guns 6-inch howitzers[228-3].1,409 86 269-10 32

From the above the following comparison can be made between the probable number of guns in the field on the 1st Mav and the estimate of requirements.Available.Required.3-inch field guns3-inch mountain guns4&apos;8-inch and 4&apos;5-inch howitzers4&apos;2-inch guns , 6-inch guns .6-inch howitzers8-inch howitzers including  20-cin. howitzers 24-cm. mortars 11-inch guns 12-inch howitzers 24-cm. guns 28-cm. howitzers5,634 940 720 240 56 480250&quot;81* Including 32 from Creusot.There is, in addition to the above, a certain amount of siege artillery at Ossovietz which was rescued from Brest Litovsk. Out of these it is hoped to make 100 four-gun batteries of heavy guus by the spring. On the other hand, of the 3,090 field guns now in the field, 2,000 required retubing in December 1915.3. A comparison of the figures given for the estimated requirements of the Russian Army on the 1st May with those estimated as being actually available on that date shows a deficiency of 749 field guns, or about 1 battery per division, as well as a deficiency in other types with the exception of the 4*5-inch or 4&apos;8-inch howitzer. In that case, however, there are 209 howitzers in excess of the estimated requirements.Supply of Ammunition.4. Output in Russia. It is impossible to form an estimate of the actual state of the ammunition supply owing to the fact that no information can be obtained as to the amount at present available, but the following figures show the output of Russian factories in December, as reported by our military attache, and the estimated increase in the future : 3-inch guns Output in December 1915 Estimated output in January 19164&apos;8-inch howitzers Output in December 1915It is hoped to increase this by April to . 6-inch howitzers Output in December estimated atIt is hoped to increase this by April to . 42-line guns Output in January estimated atIt is hoped to increase this by March to( (( (( (1,410,000 rounds. 1,380,000 rounds.32,310 shrapnel. 54,000 H.B. 48,000 shrapnel. 203,000 H.E.14,500 shrapnel. 3^,000 H.E. 29,000 shrapnel. 100,000 H.E.46,500 shrapnel. 19,000 H.E. 57,000 shrapnel. 24,000 H.E.It is estimated that the following can be produced from other sources than Russia :

In General CallweiTs telegram No. 141 of the 25th January mention is made of. a statement by the Chief of the Russian General Staff that he will be ready to commence a strong offensive in March. Such information as we possess as to the probable supply of munitions to Russia at that date leads us to suppose that such an offensive would be premature, but our knowledge of the actual condition of the Russian army at the present time is based, to a considerable extent, on conjecture, and it may be better than we suppose. It is quite possible that the Russians have in the past made out their situation to be worse than it actually was, in order to obtain more from their Allies. This certainly appears to have been the case as regards rifles. The chief needs of Russia at the moment are field guns, heavj^ howitzers, the ammunition for them, and ammunition for Japanese rifles. In view of the large quantity of these munitions which is being manufactured in America, and of further information which has come in since Note G-50 was written, the question of arranging for the storage of American-manufactured munitions in Canada is one of increasing urgency.War Office, January 31, 1916.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. K. HARRISON.-2/2/1916.5. The following contracts for gun ammunition have been placed in this country!the United States, and Japan :-(1.) 3-inch shell.(a.)

Shell for 42-line gun, 48-line howitzer, and 6-inch howitzer.-We are endeavouring to obtain 500,000 rounds of each type from U.S.A. It is, however, possible that these amounts may have to be reduced slightly owing to the Russian financial difficulties.(4.) 8-inch shrapnel.Contract for 8,000 rounds with Vickers.&apos; (5.) 8-inch high explosive.Contract for 24,000 rounds with Vickers.(6.) 12-inch howitzers.Contract for 7,200 rounds with Vickers.(7.)
