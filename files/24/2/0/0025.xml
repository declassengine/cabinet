Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   May 1916.SECRET. G.-71.A COMPARISON OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIGHT RAILWAYS AND CANALS BY OURSELVES AND BY THE ENEMY IN BELGIUM AND FRANCE.(The following statement Is submitted in accordance with the-request of the War Committee for a &quot; Memorandum showing what action has been taken in the direction of providing light-railways and developing the use of the system of canals behind the lines of the British Expeditionary Force in France, and what action has been taken in these matters by the enemy.&quot;)1. Light Railways. (A.)-British.1. Light railways are being or will be used by the armies in France for three main purposes :- (a.) In order to save manual labour in the trenches.(6.) For connecting the ordinary railways with the trench tramways mentioned above.(c.) In the event of an advance-for repairing the light railway system in the country.2. For trench tramways (a) above 9-lb. and 16-lb, track of 60 cm. gauge is used, and of this some 300 and 100 miles respectively have been ordered while 190 miles of 9-lb. track have been delivered, and deliveries of the 9-lb, track are being effected at the rate of 10 miles a week.   Rolling-stock is arranged for in due proportion.The tramways are used in. the trenches and back from the trenches up to the points in front of which horse transport, cannot be used.3. For connecting railheads with the trench tramways ((6) above), the track used is 9&apos;5 kilog. per metre, and of this 75 miles has been ordered, with rolling-stock in proportion, and deliveries will commence in June at the rate of 5 miles a week. There is a certain amount of this track already laid which was available locally.4. As explained above, the. metre gauge is reserved for use in the event of an advance, and 50 miles of 50-lb. track have been ordered with rolling-stock, and of this 40 miles have been delivered or are in process of delivery. Details of the rolling-stock, &amp;c, are shown on the attached statement.

The Germans have shown considerable activity in augmenting the existing system of light railways in Belgium and Northern France, especially in the region immediately in rear of the zone of hostilities. The material for these railways has been obtained to a great extent by dismantling a large number of light railways in Eastern Belgium and a few in France.The total mileage of these new railways is 75 miles.2. In addition to various lines connecting the existing railways with points immediately in rear of the trenches, these new railways comprise a system connecting Lille and Menin, and perhaps Tournai as well, and also a railway along the coast between Ostend and Nieuport. In some cases an existing light railway has been converted to normal gauge, and some of the new railways may also be normal gauge.In the area immediately south of the Somme, about 15 miles of light railway have been constructed.3. It is not possible to estimate the number of miles of trench tramways laid by the Germans, but it is known that they make full use of this method of transport. They have been induced to do this because shortage of petrol and rubber forced them to reduce their motor services ; and secondly, because an ample supply of material lay close at hand in the mining districts of Belgium and of Northern France.II. Canals. (A.) British.1. The following are briefly the duties which are carried out by the Inland Water Transport Service: (a.) The provision of all personnel necessary to man craft required for work on thewaterways and the provision of the necessary vessels. (6.) The transport of supplies and materials of all kinds as required by the army, (c.) The clearing of all debris caused by accident, or demolition, or obstructionsplaced therein by the enemy.
Id.) The repairs and maintenance of craft in efficient working order. (e.) The repairs and renewals as necessary to all locks and lock gates destroyed by the enemy.(/.) The working of any inland waterway quays and docks for military purposes. (g.) The repairs of all telephone lines required for working the canal and river traffic.(h.) The regulating of traffic on the waterways.(i.) The operating of all lift and swing bridges and waterways in the rear of the British army.(j.) The working of all locks in Belgium or France behind the army, until they &apos; could be taken over again by the &quot; Ponts et Chaussees &quot; establishments of these countries.2. The present authorised strength is 10 sections, each consisting of 18 officers and 328 other ranks. In addition to this, general approval has been given to six further sections, which will be recruited as and when required. The sections are composed of about 70 per cent, seamen and lighterman class, and 30 per cent, of various trades required for the maintenance and repair of craft and of canals, lock gates, bridges, &amp;c. The personnel at present overseas is 83 officers and 2,550 other ranks.3. The length of canals and rivers operated by the Inland Water Transport behind the lines in France total about 340 miles, and the repair and upkeep of these waterways is carried out by three salvage units, each consisting of a crane (10-ton) barge, barrack barges (eighty n.c.o&apos;s. and men), workshop barge, store barge, and two small pile-driving barges.4. The following is approximately the number of vessels at present in the serviceoverseas:  g0Tugs    .... *&apos;                    &quot; 60Self-propelled barges -      ... &quot;         .. 14Launches           - - * -         - *                                            ,. 3Uraue bareres      .. - -         - -                    &apos;          &quot;         ... 5Filtration barges .. ..          - -          &apos;&apos;   &apos;                               .. 20Water-tank barges ..          - -          &quot;&quot;     .    &quot; &apos;                      &apos;&apos; 2Pump barges      .. - &apos;                               &quot;*         &apos;&apos; 370Dumb barges       .. v          &quot;                      ... 18Ambulance barges.. ..       .Of the ordinary dumb barges a number are used for the following special purposes in addition to ordinary transport work, viz., bridge-repair barges, coal hulks, rationing, store, workshop, and barrack barges.5. The acquisition of a further 100 self-propelled vessels and 200 dumb vessels has been approved, and steps are being taken to obtain these craft, and craft are being built in England and purchased from Holland for this purpose.6. Since the inauguration of the Inland Water Transport early in 1915 400,000 tons deadweight of stores and materials of all kinds for the army have been carried on the Inland Waterways.7. About 16,000 serious cases have been carried on the ambulance barges; and an additional twelve ambulance barges are now being fitted out, which will increase the total fleet to thirty ambulance barges.8. At the seaports of Calais and Dunkirk considerable assistance has been rendered to ocean vessels by clearing overside direct into Inland Water Transport craft; assistance has been given to clear about 360 sea transports in this manner, representing a total tonnage of about 300,000 tons.9. It has recently been decided to load special strongly-built barges with supplies on this side, which will discharge at depots on the canals overseas. The construction of these barges has been begun and anangements made to develop this traffic on a large scale.10. In conclusion, the Inland Water Transport overseas has been, and is being, developed on the broadest lines, and all demands both for personnel and material have been met from this side.(B.) German.The inland waterways of Belgium are administered by the Belgium &quot; Ponts et Chaussees &quot;Department, under the control of a German staff. The actual supervision of the canals is in the hands of a motor-boat volunteer corps.   The Germans have
