SECRET.NOTE PREPARED FOR THE WAR COMMITTEE BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL . STAFF ON THE QUESTION OF OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS ON THE WESTERN FRONT.1. FOR more than a year continuous fortified lines have been established on the Western front from Switzerland to the Channel, and since the German offensive in the West was brought to a standstill in November 19loathe Allies have on several occasions attacked the enemy&apos;s defences without breaking torongh. The question has, therefore, naturally often been asked : Is there any reasonable prospect that our efforts in the future wi]l be more successful than they have been in the past ? If the answer is in the negative, it becomes necessary to seek an easier way to our goal the defeat of the Central Powers and, as explained both by my predecessor and by myself, great military difficulties and dangers confront any such attempt. I now desire, therefore, to put before the War Committee my views as to some of the causes which have led to failure in the past and my reasons for thinking that there are good grounds for anticipating a large measure of success in the future. &quot;2. It is a commonplace that warfare on the Western front approximates very closely to the siege of a huge fortress. Now, one of the first conditions of success in an attack on a fortress is that the besieger should have free access to all the- resources he requires, while the besieged is limited to those in his possession when he was first invested. It is a natural corollary of this that the available resources of the besieger must be greater than those of the besieged.In the present war the potential resources of the Entente Powers were from the outset superior to those of-the enemy,&apos;but it has taken a very long time to make those resources available at the time and in the form required; indeed, when the war of trenches first began, the superiority of the enemy in the requirements of siege warfare was very great. This was not due to exceptional prescience on his part, for the negation of manoeuvre was entirely contrary to his wishes and anticipations, but, knowing that the French and Russian frontier bristled with fortresses, he had realised that sieges must play a large part in any offensive operations across his borders, and had made preparations accordingly. He had large technical establishments trained in siege warfare and provided with the latest equipment, and it was therefore an easy matter for him to expand these rapidly to meet the special conditions of the present time/ It also happened that force of circumstances drove the Germans in the right direction. They realised long ago the superiority of the French &quot; 75 &quot; field gun, and were compelled to find a suitable reply to that superiority. To re-arm their field artillery with an equally good, or better, gun would have taken a long time, and been very costly. They therefore turned their attention to the development of the howitzer, the type of ordnance which has proved indispensable in trench warfare. We, on the other hand, had not considered it possible that our small expeditionaiy force would be engaged in extensive siege operations, and had neither studied the problems involved, nor made preparation to meet them. We had, therefore, first to find out by experience what was required, next get level with the enemy, and then obtain the moral and material superiority which is the first step towards successful attack. It has taken us long to reach this stage, more especially as we had not only to provide the necessary equipment, and to train the men to use it, but had at the same time to absorb new and inexperienced troops and create higher formations (army corps and armies) which need time to find themselves. We may now fairly claim to have reached the desired stage. During this winter not only has our artillery established a definite superiority over that of the enemy, but our infantry has repeatedly raided the enemy&apos;s trenches and inflicted considerable loss upon him at trifling cost to ourselves, without drawing from him any effective reply.[137] B 2
3. The next step in the attack on a fortress is to make a practicable breach in the defences. This is mainly a question of a sufficiency of guns and ammunition of the right type. In the early stages of an attack against trenches the artillery now gains the ground, the infantry occupies it when won; but it has been proved by experience that the increased range and power of modern artillery make it essential that an attack which aims at breaking through the enemy&apos;s defences should be made on a sufficiently wide front to prevent the enemy from bringing his guns to bear from a flank upon the central columns of attacking infantry. The minimum front which fulfils this condition is, under normal conditions of ground, 20,000 yards in extent, and, speaking generally, the larger the front which can be attacked with adequate means, the greater are the chances of success.For an attack against trenches it is necessary to have both a sufficiency of field-guns and field-gun ammunition to destroy the enemy&apos;s wire entanglements and stop the movement of his reinforcements, a sufficiency of heavy and medium howitzers to batter down his trenches and machine-gun emplacements, and a sufficiency of long-range guns and howitzers to neutralise his artillery. For some time past we have had an adequate number of field-guns and field-gun ammunition for an attack on a wide front, but we have never yet had the other natures of guns and ammunition in sufficient quantity. The front of our Loos attack was limited, mainly by the number of heavy guns and the amount of heavy ammunition available, to about 9,000 yards. We had, in September, sufficient of both for that front, when used in combination with gas, but not for a larger attack. There is reason to hope that we shall have in France, by the spring, an adequate reinforcement in men, guns, and ammunition to enable an attack on a much larger scale to be carried out by British troops.4. But, it will be asked, if we have never yet had the means of attacking on the required scale, why have we attacked at all ?There has been frequently, I believe, a misconception as to what we were aiming at in the various offensive operations we have undertaken. In the first place, though the trench lines have been established for more than a year, and consequently a very natural feeling of impatience with the absence of decisive results has risen in the public mind, we have only made three serious attacks on the enemy&apos;s lines ; the first at Neuve Chapelle in March, the second at Festubert in May, the third at Loos in September. In the second place, the instructions issued by His Majesty&apos;s Government to our Commander-in-Ghief in France are to the effect that he is to co-operate with the French in the defeat of the enemy&apos;s forces by which the Allies are opposed on the AVestern front. It has been generally assumed that, in every instance in which we have taken the offensive, the intention has been that the British forces should break through the enemy&apos;s lines on the front of attack. But what are the facts ? The attack at Neuve Chapelle was carried out in order to raise the offensive spirit of our troops, who had passed through a long winter of inactivity, and had, with rare exceptions, been compelled to act defensively during the first months of the war ; to gain experience of offensive operations under the conditions of trench warfare ; and to secure a footing on La Bassee-Lille road, which would allow of further operations against Lille or La Bassee. There was never at any time any intention of breaking right through the enemy&apos;s lines with the comparatively small force employed on a narrow front.The operations in May were carried out in conformity with General Joffre&apos;s plan and in co-operation with General Foch&apos;s attack on Vimy. We were at that time severely handicapped by the expenditure of troops and of ammunition caused by the situation, which the collapse of the French on our left at Ypres before the German gas attack in April had created. As a consequence of this limitation of our resources, our efforts were confined to assisting the French by keeping as many Germans as possible employed.At Loos a definite attempt was made to break the enemy&apos;s front, but only in co-operation with General Foch&apos;s attack on our right. Here, again, the operations were planned by General J offre, and we were definitely asked to undertake the Loos attack as a prolongation of the attack of the French 10th Army on our right. To have pressed forward beyond Hullnch, once the latter attack had failed, and it did fail, would have led to almost certain disaster.Thus it will be seen that we have never yet attempted, or been in a position to attempt, to break through the enemy&apos;s lines with British troops alone. Clearly, when we can make this attempt we shall greatly strengthen the offensive power of the Allies, and this reinforcement in strength will not be limited to the number of additional men
and guns we devote to the offensive. Experience has repeatedly shown us how difficult it is to combine effectively on one battlefield the operations of armies of different nationality, with different habits of mind, and different tactical methods. When we can prepare an attack on a sufficient scale to make us independent of direct tactical support by the French this difficulty will have been removed.5. Up to the present, then, such attacks as we have made in co-operation with the French have been subordinated to their&apos;s, as they have been on a comparatively small scale, and also from the commencement of the campaign it has been the custom for us to do, more or less, what the French have requested us to do. For more reasons than one it is time this custom was modified. In the first place, the French plans have hitherto seldom been to our liking, and they have not been conspicuously successful. In the second place, as I have already explained, we may hope in the early spring to be able to make our weight tell more effectively than hitherto. That being so, the French may be expected to pay greater attention to our views, and I believe they are prepared to welcome advice from us.0. In the September offensive the general idea underlying the French plan was that the enemy&apos;s defences would be broken through in one great rash. The British General Headquarters were in doubt of the possibility of this, and the result shows that they were right. The main lessons of the September attack, as of all previous attacks, are that, given adequate artillery preparation or some form of surprise, such as a gas attack, there is no insuperable difficulty in overwhelming the enemy&apos;s troops in the front line and in support, but that there is the greatest difficulty in defeating the enemy&apos;s reserves, which have not been subjected to the strain of a long bombard-in ent, and come up in good order, fresh from their billets, to meet our troops at a time when they are somewhat exhausted, in confusion, and out of hand. These conditions are unavoidable in any modern battle, and they are the more pronounced in the kind of fighting in which we are engaged, because the hostile defences must necessarily be stormed, and storming necessarily means disorder. It is after the assault is completed that the analogy of an attack on a fortress ceases, and we enter upon conditions which are entirely new to war. In the siege of a place a successful assault means victory, and disorder among the victors is a matter of small moment. In modern trench warfare this assault is but the prelude to a fresh battle with the reserves which the enemy has quartered behind his trench lines. To pass from this state of disorder to one of good order and control in sufficient time to enable us to reap the fruits of the successful assault by defeating the hostile reserves has hitherto been beyond our powers.7. The great problem, therefore, which we have to consider before we fight again is when, where, and how to bring up our reserves in order to defeat the enemy&apos;s reserves. This problem has always faced commanders in every battle, but the conditions of trench warfare and the absence of a flank at which to aim, have greatly increased the difficulty of solving it. On the other hand, it cannot yet be admitted that they have materially altered the basic principles upon which battles have been fought in the past. What we need to do is to apply these principles correctly rather than think of casting them aside. These principles are&quot; that sufficient force should be employed to exhaust the enemy and force him to use up his reserves, and that then, and then only, the decisive attack, which is to win victory, should be driven home. Hitherto both we and the French have attempted to carry out the decisive attack without first drawing in the enemy&apos;s reserves. We have seen the enemy denuding the parts of his front on which he was not being attacked in order to meet us at the points where we were attacking, and there seems to be no doubt that if we had been able to launch a powerful attack against some part of the front from which the enemy had been forced to withdraw his reserves the chances of success would have been much greater than were those of the attacks we actually made. The whole question of the improve-ment of the Allied methods of attack on these general lines is now being closely studied by the Commander-in-Chief in France.8. I have not yet touched upon a further and even more important improvement of method. It is notorious that there has hitherto been no real co-operation between the Allied Powers on the various fronts. In September and October last, owing to the fact that the delivery of the Allied attacks had to be delayed because the French preparations could not be completed in time, the enemy was enabled to transfer some ten divisions from the eastern to the western front, and this transference of force very
materially affected the result. Now that the enemy&apos;s offensive has ffor the time being-been brought to a standstill on both the main fronts, it should be possible to ensure better co-operation between all the Allies and, in fact, steps have already been taken to effect this.9. Despite then of the fact that the French have made two great efforts to break through the German front and have failed, it does not follow that the Allies will fail again, because not only is it possible for us greatly to increase the power of an Allied offensive on the western front, but our increased influence can be exerted to obtaining better methods of attack. Both we and the French have gained valuable experience, which can be put to good account. To take one example, the French have hitherto relied mainly upon the effect of their &quot; 75 &quot; field gun, but they have found that despite a stupendous expenditure of ammunition, far exceeding in rounds per gun any expenditure of ours, this gun is not sufficiently powerful to deal with modern trenches. They are now devoting great attention to the improvement of their heavy artillery, both in training, equipment, and number of guns. When the results of the September attack are considered, there is every reason to hope that a greater effort, conducted with greater skill, will give us a large measure of success.10. On the whole, therefore, it would seem that the prospects of future offensive operations in France are good. At the same time I wish it to be clearly understood that it is highly improbable that the enemy will be completely defeated as the result of a single great effort. On the contrary, we must anticipate prolonged fighting, a great expenditure of ammunition and heavy losses, even when his defensive lines have been penetrated.In order to gain a decisive victory the initial success obtained must be followed up immediately, giving the enemy no time to recover, or to establish himself securely on other lines of defence. This can only be done by continually throwing in fresh troops, and ensuring the maintenance of an almost unlimited supply of ammunition. While, therefore, one great effort will not in itself prove decisive, it may, if resolutely followed up, enable us to break the enemy&apos;s line on a sufficiently wide front to admit of the passage of large numbers of men. If the attack be made in such a direction as to enable us to intercept the line of retreat of even a part of the enemy&apos;s forces, it may involve him in absolute disaster.In war it is impossible to guarantee success. This plan may thorefore fail, or at least meet only with such partial success as attended our efforts last September, but in this connection I would point out that during the last year the results achieved have always increased proportionately to the increase in the power of the attack. Even if our success be no greater than that obtained in the past the attempt would appear to be justified. The Germans are approaching the limit of their resources, both as regards men and material, and though the French resources in men are also diminishing, we have the power to make good the deficiency. An attack which inflicted upon the enemy losses as great as they incurred last September, would have a far greater moral effect than it did then, both upon the enemy and the nation, would deplete their last remaining reserves, and appreciably shorten the duration of their resistance.W.
