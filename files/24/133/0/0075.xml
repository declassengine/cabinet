PART IV - TRADE SERVICES GROUP.

1. The Second Interim Report recommends that the ordinary services of the Board of Trade including Department of Overseas Trade, Mercantile Marine Service, Mines Department and Ministry of Transport should be reduced from £1,887,856 to £1,350,000, i.e. a reduction of approximately £538,000. The Committee recommend a reduction of approximately £513,000.

Ministry of Transport.

2. The Ministry are prepared to effect all the economics recommended by the Geddes Committee but they are not in a position to bring about at present the sale of the Caledonian and Crinan Canals recommended by the Geddes Committee for the reason that these waterways are liabilities which nobody under present circumstances is willing to take over.

The Committee recommend that the Ministry of Transport should not continue as a separate Ministry with its present functions. As to the Ministry by which its duties are to be performed they consider that the transfer of the Ministry&apos;s functions to the Board of Trade might unduly overburden that Department and would introduce into the relations with Local Authorities a Department not at present closely concerned with those Authorities.

No material economy would be effected by the arrangement. In those circumstances they consider that the question of the allocation of the functions of the Ministry should be reserved for the early consideration of a Committee appointed by the Cabinet.

The Committee see no prospect of transferring the financial responsibility for the Caledonian and Crinan Canals to the Local Authorities. It is at the same time undesirable that these canals should be closed. The Committee consider that no immediate reductions in the Estimates


Estimates are possible in respect of these services. They have requested the Ministry of Transport to investigate the question of transferring the responsibility for the Monai Bridge, Ramsgate Harbour, the Caledonian and Crinan Canals to the local Authorities concerned.

The Committee recommend reductions bringing the Estimate for 1922/23 to £221,618. They have requested the Treasury and the Ministry of Transport in consultation to examine the estimated expenditure on staff with a view to seeing whether further reductions cannot be effected.

(b) Department of Overseas Trade.

The Committee recommend that the Department should cease as a separate Department.

They recognise that the proposed arrangement under which the commercial representatives in foreign countries will come under the control of the Foreign Office but be available for direct communication with Board of Trade may not prove satisfactory. They consider that the position of these officers should be carefully considered by the cabinet.

(c) Petrolcum Department.

The reduction on this service will amount to £94,000.

The Committee recommend that the Petroleum Department should be discontinued, giving a reduction of £9,000.

(d) Mines Department.

The Committee do not think that any saving would be realised by the distribution of the functions of the Mines Department among the various Ministries from which they were taken, and the Geddes Committee does not propose any economy which would result in any saving in this Department. The Committee have requested the Treasury to furnish a report on the subject. The Committee recommend that the Department should be definitely made a Department of the Board of Trade and that the Secretary of Mines should be an Under-Secretary of the Board of Trade.

(?)

 
e) Board of Trade. Mercantile Marine.

The Committee agree that the Power, Transport and Economic Departments should be amalgamated with the Industries and Manufactures Department and that the Transport Section, Mercantile Marine Department should be reduced to pro-war dimensions. The Committee agree that legislation should be introduced at an early date (1) to discontinue the inspection of ships provisions. (2) to fix fees to make the following services self-supporting. - Regulation of Business Names, Mercantile Marine Offices, Surveyors staff, Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen.

f) War Aftermath Services.

The Committee are of opinion that those services should be considered in connection with the allocation of functions between the Board of Trade and other Departments.

EXPORTS CREDIT SCHEME.

The Committee agree that the sum of £500,000 only should be provided on Estimates 1922/23.

...............


The Interim Bepert recommends a total reductioncf  655,OOO on these services.     On the lines set out below the reduction on the Sstimatos will amount to&apos; approximately  642,000* -a) Ministry of        The greater part of the curtailment of the Agricultureand activities of the Department, recommended in the fisheries,Report, will not take effsot In the coming year.     The Administration.largost item is the expenditure on tho administrationof tho land settlement scheme.     It is represented thatit would be false economy to reduce tho control exercised by tho Department ever the expenditure ofCounty Councils, and that, in view of the pledge to ex-seryioe men, it i could not bo desirable to slow downtho activities of the Councils.     Tho Minister is:prepared to make a saving of  60, OOO and has undertaken to consider whether a further&apos; red notion is practicable.agricultural ffhon the Corn Production Acts were repealed iniucationd August 1921 it was agreed in consideration of thewearoh.abandonment of the olaims of agriculturalists under tho Acts that a special fund of SI,000,000 should be set aside for agricultural education and rosoarch. The Minister of Agriculture&apos; and Fisheries and the Secretary for Scotland consider that, in addition to providlhg this sum, the Govex-nment is pledged as part of the bargain to maintain the existing services Including tho scheme for the improvement cvomant of liva-stoole. In these circjamstanoes the Minister does not fool able to make any reductions under this ho ad.
,tve stock.Owing :toihe outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease : it is. necessary to provide the, full sum of  140,000 laid-down in the Diseases of. Animals Aot   in order to recoup the Looal Taxation Account.    The saving of  31,500 included in the provisional Estimates cannot - thoreforo bo effected.It is recognised in tho Report that. it is not possible to do more, than reduce the provision for Light Horse Breeding in the estimates for 1922/23. Ho provision will bo made in tho Estimates for future years. . .The Minister of Agriculture and Pishorios is prepared to make a reduction of  13,000 on these services,land&apos; Settlement.

The Committee recommend a reduction of  165,925 on these services. - This, figure includes a reduction of  50,000 on. the provision for payment of losses untor the 1 and settlement scheme, a re duo tioh of  20,500. on land drainage, receipts from sales of land aoqaired under, the, Small Holdings Colonies Acts and; other economies.It is necessary to provide in 1922/23 a sum of  20,000 as a revote to meet deferred payments of tho guaranteed minimum, prioos for&apos; Wheat and.

Board of Agriculture fcr Scotland.Administrative Expenditure.Agricultural Education&apos; and Research.Land Settlement.The Interim Report recommends a&apos; reduction of&apos; 80,971 cn the net Estimates.   Tin. Secretary, for Scotland has submitted proposals which would, effect a: reduction; of  8o,GlO but involve a variation of the detailed economies recommended in the Report.The proposed reduction of approximately  29,000&apos; can only be secured by.a modification of the rate of land settlement in Scotland.&apos; In view of the pledge td- ex-Service men, the Secretary for Scotland would deprecate any restriction on the B^ard^ activities, until at, least Martinmas&apos; 1922.     He ie prepared to effect a reduction of  1.6,677. in. the year 1922/23.The opinion of the Secretary for Scotland in regard to agricultural education and research and the scheme for the improvement of live stock has been set out in the part of our. Report dealing with the. Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,    The Secretary for -Scotland is prepared to reduce the expenditure on these services by making working economies amounting to  5\00C.It is found necessary to increase the provision fcr meeting the deficit cn annual charges in respect of land Settlement by   &apos;  18,000.The Secretary for. Scotland proposes to effect the remainder- of the reduction, in the Estimates fcr 1922/23,r 7 - (a.)

Ifiura -estimated to produce       .000. -Theaf po3?t&apos;hp-conclusion in the Interim Report is... as follows &quot;That after the next financial year ail -expenses in connection with Agriculture should be charged to the Votes, and that the Agriculture (Scotland) iUnd should be limited to Land Settlement and Crofter Housing&apos;1 .ITo economy in 1922/23 is involved by this rO&apos;0-ommendation,     The Secretary for Scotland considers that this question falls outside the Terms of Reference iff tho Committee on National Expenditure and desires an opportunity of discussing the matter fully with the Chancellor of tho Exchequer.     The Committee are of opinion that this view is reasonable.     They make no recommendation,Land Settlement Tho Interim Report recommends that aFunds, ...limit of  17,000,000 total expenditure shouldbe substituted for  20,000,000 in England and/Wales
in.--S ootlandThe Ministry of Agriculture, and Fisheries ic prepared to...accept this recommendation in the case of England and Wales subject to the &apos; following oondit ions:-(1)   That the Cabinet accept responsibility for breaking its pledges to the 6,000 or 7)000 approved ex-Service applicants who will not&apos; secure holdings if the funds are limited as proposed. (2)   That it is understood that no holdings can be. provided at. present- on an economic basis and that consequently the ;&quot;     . expenditure of the ,margin of  l,6l!?,000, referred to by the C-oddes Committee,.. &quot; will probably increase the annual losses by  100.,000 a year. (3)   That, the margin in hand out. of tire. 17,000,000 can be used for the purchase&apos; : . of land as; well as for equipment.The Secretary for Scotland is prepared with great - misgiving to- accept th6,  recommend at ion in the case of Scotland subject, to .the same conditions with the necessary alterations in figures.     Ihile the Secretary, for Scotland considers that the demand for holdings is more urgent in Scotland, than in England .and that the consequences of a restriction of existing activities would be more, serious^ he is doubtful*&quot; 1 &apos;&apos;&apos; /whether
whether it would be practicable to differentiate between the two countries.   lie reduction is involved in expenditure in 1922/23 by this re coronandat ion.The Committee consider that the vrhole question should be reviewed in the light of events before Martinriao, 1922.(a)   Fishery The Interim Report recomtaonds that theBoard for &quot;  &apos;Scotland. Vote 3hould be reduced from  57,629 to  50,000.It is specifically recommended that a saving should be effected in the cost of telegraph information and by the abolition of Fishery Correspondents.The Committee are informed that the coat of telegraph information amounts to only  350 per annum and they agree that it would not be desirable to impose a charge for this service on the fishing community at the present time. . In lieu of these proposals the Secretary for Scotland is prepared to make reductions amounting to  1.5?6 on the grant in aid of Piers and Harbours, wages and travelling expenses.     The Comuitteo recommend that these proposals should ova accepted.     The net provision to be made in the Estimates 1922/23 would accordingly bo  5l,S50, plus  900 being the cost of telegrams which by Treasury instruction has been transferred from the Post Office to the Fishery Board for Scotland Vote,  i.e. a final figure of  ^2,750./The Committee
The Cemmittee are informed that the Fishery Board for Scotland have applied for an advance of  5,^00, ( 3,700 cf which is a rovote) from the Development Fund in tho year 1922/23 in aid of a scheme for the exten-sion of the Bay of Higg Laboratory.     As a result of this extension part of the Board&apos;s existing ^ocommodat ion would be transferred to the Ministry cf Labour.   The Committee consider that this scheme should be postponed and that arrangements should be made for the Board to ret a in their ex i s t i ng a c c oaimo dat ion.Ordnance Survey. The Committee agree tc the reduction of 10&apos;6j000 recommended in the Interim Report,. but, recommend the following -variation in . detail..- It is not desirable to discharge immediately 143 employees, who would find great-difficulty in obtaining other employment.     The Committee recommend a reduction in staff of about 70 in 192.2/23, the remainder being effected in the following year.     In the meantime an equal caving can be effected cn salaries,, travelling expenses, expenditure on paper and by other economies,
Forestry Commission. Tho Interim Report recommends that thescheme of afforestation by the State should he discontinued, that tho Vote for 1922/23 should not be allowed and that any unspent balance in the Forestry Fund should be surrendered to tho Exchequer after meeting any liabilitie accruing in 1928/23 in respect of timber survey.The Forestry Commission estimate that tho unavoidable expenditure, if these recommendations are carried out* will amount to . 109.,500 per annum.     They have submitted minimum proposals entailing an annual expen&amp;i-ture of  186,000.     On this scheme the Corn-mission could carry on, with a nucleus of their existing organisation, utiliPtng steaks of seeds and plants, afforesting 7,O0Q aeresiand replanting in Crown Woods approximately 1,500 acres of timber felled during the War. The Forestry Commission recommend, however; a scheme, estimated to cost  215,000 in 1922/23, under which no expenditure would be incurred, on the inquisition of land during the year, but the planting pro-gramme would be increased to 10,000 aores.     Of the additional cost  27,000 would be spent on labour.     The afforestation of the additional acreage4 would bo achieved without any increase in the administrative staff required for the minimum programme.There/
There will he an . unexpended, balance; in the Forestry Fund of about  125.000 .&apos;at the end of the current year.     In addition a sum of  50,000 out of the Unemployment Helief Orant is not earmarked for relief purposes.,  The Gqmmittee;&apos; are :of. opinion that, the complete-.abandonment, of&apos;, the policy laid down in the-Forestry Act 1919 would be open to serious criticism.     It would have a grave effect on the forestry policy -of the Empire. Wagesi form a large proportion of the expenditure on forestry and. the dismissal of the Commission&apos; staff would create considerable unemployment.   . The Committee are of opinion that.it would be false economy to maintain the nucleus organ!sa-tion.   &apos; In these circumstances and having regard to the small amount of additional, money required in the year 1922/23, the Committee recommend&apos;;,., the adoption of the scheme estimated to cost  215., 000.     They are not, however,  satisfied.    . that the full&apos; sum. of   15,000, as estimated by . the Commission,  Is required to-&apos;carry &quot;out this scheme and they have -requested the Treasury to examine the estimate with a view to effecting, reductions thereon.. -,&quot; -
