Memoranjijia by the Minis te r of ha hour.In my memorandura to the Cabinet dated 3rd February (0 if * 3689 ) I said that it was necessary to look ahead and determine a connected polioy in regard to the treatment ofUnemp1oyment Insuran c o.I have since been considering carefully the lines on which proposals should be made for dealing with the situa-tion which will arise when the period for which benefit is now being paid comes to an end.I would remind my Colleagues that unemployed workers will commence to exhaust their benefit rights on ,22nd February.     There is power in the Acts to extend these rights for another six weeks and in view of the present situation as described in CP.3689 it will be necessary to announce this extension at once.I have considered further the conditions on which the six weeks1 extension should be granted.    (They should, in addition to the existing conditions, be generally as fellows; (l) Workers under 18 years of age who, whenemployed,are not dependent on their earnings for theirlivelihood, should be excluded from the extended rights.This was done in the case of the first extension.
(2) In the case of single men and women and of widowers and widows, without ohildren under 14, the extension shall not be granted if they are living with a relative who maintains a home of his own.   (This will apply particularly to young single men and women who are living with their parents.(3) Applicants must be prepared to accept any work on fair terms and conditions which they are reasonably capable of performing..(4) Local Employment Committees should be directed to have regard to the earnings of short-time workers.(5) Committees should also be specially directed to examine carefully all oases of persons who have previously drawn Unemployment Benefit for long periods. In the case of women there are manifestly vacancies to which their attention should be directed.I have given further oareful consideration to the possibility of reducing the rates of benefit at the time the extension.of six weeks comes into operation and 1 nhave, definitely come to the conclusion that the present is a most inopportune time for making such a reduction. I propose, therefore, - that the present rates cf benefit shall be continued until 5th April, 19&amp;2.Beyond this the Temporary Dependants1 Grants Act ceases to operate on 9th May.The grant of free benefit now possible under the Act comes to an end altogether on 2nd July.     There,  is
therefore, a period between 5th April ani 2nd July during which an increasing number of persons will exhaust their benefit rights each week.In view of the prospeots of employment in tho year fi-om July 1922 to July 1923 I think it is neoossary to provide now for the period between 5th April, when present benefit rights begin to terminate, and July 1923.I propose in consultation with the Treasury and the Government Actuary to consider a scheme dealing with the whole situation which would require legislation,Broadly the lines on which I should propose to frame a Scheme would be(a) make provision on an emergency basis for the period from 5th April to the beginning of November, 1922; and for the period from November 1922 to July 1923;(b) merge the present provision for dependants under the Temporary Act in the general Scheme of Unemployment Insurance by-granting a higher rate of benefit than 15/- to married men, and a lower rate to single men?Co)    as from July 1923 put the scheme on a permanent basis differentiating between married and single persons,(Sgd)&apos;   T.
