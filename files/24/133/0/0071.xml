Febry.. 1922.1/Esaex R. from Kinsale to Carrickfergus.Thus all moves to Northern Ireland will be completed by the night 21/22.
In addition to the above; detachments of the 2/Rifle Brigade were moved from dinner Camp to Beleek and Enniskillen, and detachments of lae 2,/R.West Kent R. from Ballykinlar to Newry, Armagh, and Fivemiletown.2.     In DUBLIN DISTRICT all troops are concentrated in or about Dublin except for the 33rd. Bde. R.F.A. at Dundalk.In the 5th. Division all troops are concentrated in or about tho Curragh except for the battelions at Athlone and Tullamcre.In the 6th. Division troops are concentrated in or about Cork except for -1 Battalion at Bantry (temporarily In quarantine) 1 Battalion at Watorford (awaiting orders to embark) 1 Battalion at Fsrmoy. 2 Battalions at Limerick.3-     The situation on the frontier of Northern Ireland has been quiet.A Commission composed of 2 British Officers and two officers of Special Constabulary detailed by the Northern Government took up their residence at Clogher on 18th. February, a similar Commission composed of 2 British Officers and two representatives appointed by the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland established their Headquarters at Wonaghan on 20th. February. The orders issued to these representatives wore approved by the Secretary of State for War on 18th. February.Two officers of the Staff of the Ulster District recently made a tour along the Northern Boundary and found the situation quieter than thoy had been, led to expect.County Commandants of the Special Constabulary believe that thev have sufficient forces to deal with raids* but the County Inspectors R.I.C. in this area take a more serious view of the situation and continue to ask for troops to be stationed on the border.     This is not to be wondered at as senior officers of R.I.C, are in my experience always anxious to shirk responsibility.Londonderry City is quiet.In Co.,Tyrone there are believed to be about 400 I.R.A. inthe neighbourhood of Clady where a special constable was shot on the 9th. instant:An attempt has been made by the I.R.A. to burn the Workhouse in Strabane which has now been occupied by troops.     The Southern border of the County is well patrolled by specials , whose commanders are more confident and better informed than the officers of the R.I.C. in the County.The border of Co.Fermanagh, except where it marches with Co.Monaghan, appears to be fairly quiet.     It is believed .that a large number of I.R.A.  (said to be about 1,400) is collected inthe Monaghan &quot;Salient&quot; between Clones &amp; Fmyvale.-2-
4.     Under instructions received from the Lord Lieutenant 10 prominent members of the I.FLA. who had been arrested for carrying arms in Ulster when en route to a football match were taken over from the Governor of Londonderry Prison at 0900 hours 20th. Febry. by a Military oscort and conveyed five miles -along the Letterkenny into Go.Donegal and liberated.5.     The attack on the party of Special Constabulary at Clones on 11th. February,, following the kidnapping of several prominent Blstermen on 10th. February caused considerable indignation in Ulster and particularly In Belfast where sniping broke out in several areas on afternoon of 12th. February and continued on the following day;   many civilians of both factions wore killed and wounded by bombs and firearms.     Order was finally restored but not until the whole of the available troops in tho Belfast garrison had been employed in aid of the police.6.     On 15th. February Lieut.Genochio, Royal Engineers, was apparently kidnapped and no further news was heard of him until his dead bod:/ was found near the grounds of the Cork Asylum at 11.00 hours on 17th.     The whole matter is still shrouded, in mystery, though every endeavour Is being made to ascertain how the unfortunate young officer came to be kidnapped and by whom he was murdered,.     The investigations are made more difficult by the extraordinary state of affairs obtaining In Cork.     Lieut Genochio1s body was brought to Victoria Barracks and.was demanded by the. King&apos;s Coroner who wished to hold the inquest at the City Morgue, and who at first claimed to be acting on the orders of the Provisional Government.     As it would have been impossible to send the very Important Military witnesses to this place unescorted Without grave risk of their being kidnapped or worse,  and as the provisions of an adequate escort would have given the Jury and civilian witnesses an excuse for non-attendance, the Coroner was asked to hold the inquest in the barracks.     This he declined to do,, as he feared the jury would not turn up.The Provisional Government.declined to help as they feared their orders would not- be obeyed.The Liaison officer ir Cork would do nothing, as he &quot;did not recognise the Provisional Government.&quot;Finally the Coroner stated that he was acting on the instructions of a &quot;Competent&apos;Authority&quot; (whoever this may be, probably I.R.A.) - so I gave Instructions that a Military Enquiry was to be held in lieu of an inquest.The inquest would In all probability have been valueless, particularly in view of the presence of Be Valera and many of his satellites in Cork City at the time.7..    On the: 20th. February three outrages were carried out by armed men all within Ih hours in the neighbourhood of INCHICORE on... the outskirts of Lublin, the first being: an attempt to hold up an officer..of the R.A.F. which failed;    there were no casualties:..The second, a 5-ton lorry returning to Dublin was held up, the driver removed and told to go away, the lorry was then burned.
The third, a Crossloy tender containing Lieut.Mead, RASC, .a /Warrant Officer in addition to the driver was fired on near Inchicore.     The Officer was killed Instantly, the Warrant Officer has since died.     The driver who was uninjured, returned with the tender to barracks.8.     The. suspension of the evacuation pf troops from Southern Ireland was no doubt ordered for very good reasons.     I have, not been informed what those reasons wore.     I hope, however, that when the evacuation is allowed to proceed it will be continued without Interruption and with all reasonable expedition.I am convinced that, as the Cabinet has decided, on the policy of evacuation, that policy should bo carried out without any unnecessary delay.     Our continued presence in Southern Ireland only acts as an irritant.     To take any effective&apos;action with our resources depleted in personnel and disorganised as regards Intelligence would only lead to further useless loss of valuable lives, &amp; might have the effect of upsetting the present delicate political equilibrium.     The Provisional Government cannot ask for our assistance without sacrificing votes to their political opponents, nor do I consider that the troops, generally speaking, should be called, upon for such duties i(Signed)    C.F.N.
