EBB TJTOfPLOYBPThe restlessness of the organised unemployed. In London Is gro?/ing and the raids.on Guardians&apos; offices during the past week may he regarded as the forerunner of other attempts. Plans are be in? made for &quot;deputations&quot; to Lewi sham, Leytonstone,. Camberwell, Southwark and West Ham:   in more than ene case the Pcplar &quot;storm troops&quot; hare promised assistance and one object of tire preliminary skirmishes is to facilitate the selection of picked men for a demonstration to Whitehall on February 13th and a subsequent simultaneous national demonstration.   The plans for these major events may be altered as the more moderate men are aware of the difficulties surrounding demonstrations in Westminster when the House is in session.Seorge Le.lansbury,s notorious advice to the unemployed to &quot;Go to the Guardians&quot; has recoiled somewhat literally upon the donor, who with his Poplar colleague 3 was Imprisoned in the Guardians1 off ices. during the night of February 6 - 7th, Led by an unemployed boilermaker named Hodgson about 900 unemployed accompanied by three bands marched to the effices:    those who obtained entry failed to make the Guardians rescind their decision to adhere te the present scale of relief and created pandemonium.   Descriptions of the night and of the final escape of George and B3gar Lansbury have appeared in the Press hut it may be added that the &quot;Red Flag&quot; hoisted over the building        the&apos; Relieving Officers1 blanket.On January 31st about 5 00 organised unemployed from Crayford, Dartford, Brith and Woolwich marched to the Dartford union whe re. the Guardians ha&amp; previously refused to receive a demonstration:   they rushed an entrance gateand /
- 2 -and took possession of the ITorkhouse dining hall:    eventually a deputation interviewed the Guardians regarding reduction in the scale of relief but the latter refused to discuss the matter,  i hearing that the police were arriving in motors the unemployed left tho building.On February End about 1,000 of the Woolwich     employed marched to the local Guardians&quot; offices and some climbed over a wooden fence which separated a church from the Workhouse garaen the police were called in by the Master who produced a pole witl which the door was forced:   a little resistance was offered by about 10 of the unemployed but truncheons were not used by Polit About 500 of the unemployed marched to Plumstead whore they san, the &quot;ReJ Flag&quot; outside the Police Station.    On February 6th, Guj the secretary of the Woolwich organised unemployed, announced publicly that they intended to augment their forces on the next occasion and would forestall police efforts to frustrate them, The Waltbamstow unemployed are demanding free baths but on February 1st one of their speakers admitted that although the Leyton unemployed had received facilities for sixty free baths only four had so far been used.On February 6th Dallas of the Camberwell unemployed stated that his organisation intended to ask the Parliamentary labour candidate to sign a document to the effect that he vrould support the   demand for full maintenance at trade union rates, the recognition of Soviet Russia an?  the re-opening of trade v/ith country:    if he signed t^e unomployod would support him ctherwi they would do their utmost to ensure his defeat at the poll.During the last week of January the number of people in receipt of poor relief in London increased by 3,534 to a total 234,599 or more than double the aggregate of the corresponding period of 1921:    29 boroughs recorded increases,the total numfa for indoor ard outdoor relief being:Paddington/

They might as well do so in paying decent relief, as to do so af,ter half-starving the unemployed.   The latter policy would hare helped to break down the spirit, and morale of the unemployed,without assisting the Guardians in the least*&quot;One af tor tho s other , the. Boards of Guardians-will go -   bankrupt, and they v ill havo &apos; to refer tho va&apos;.st&apos;1 masses of .tho unemployed -to tho centre, Sir. Alfred Mond.   And when the Government, with its oho as opr. ring ideas, is faced with an infuriated mass of &apos; two million moi-o unomployod, then we shall have a first-class crisis upon us.&quot;Apart from a slight Improvement in tho mining industry inthe Wigan district and some signs of activity in the building *trade, there is no ohango for the better in the unemployment situation in Lancashire and Cheshire,     The Lancashire cottonoperatives and engineers are atronsly of&apos;opinion.that a scheme cfinsurance against unemployed ahould be set up within&quot;theirindustry: * they consider that the State insurance scheme is abig drain and that the benefits are &quot;altogether inadequate&quot;:they allude to Labour Exchanges as !Twhito elephants which never have served., the purpose they were , intended for&quot; and instancethe case of two associations in Bolt on, which last year paid     ?benefits amounting to over  50., POO, the cost of administrationbeing about 3/4d. per head.   Although the: extremist oommittfie in liverpool&apos;has ceased to function my correspondent states- thatCommunists are working hard, in the area to obtain converts.   OnFebruary&apos;5 1st&apos;about 2,000 unemployed demonstrated outside theWarring ton WbraTouse&apos;&apos;- and rushed the gates while their deputationwas interviewing the Guardians regarding additions to tho- existing/
a    4    Mexisting scale of relief: the Guardians eventually decided toallow 5/- per   week extra and the unemployed left the workhousewithout further trouble.   About 250 unemployed, ;&amp;o should havecommenced relief work at Rune or n on February 6th refused to staras the rate of pay worked out at lO^d an hour: the council deoiflto increase their pay .b.y id. per hour,., On February 7th;Mr. &quot;John Hodge, m.p. speaking at the tcyuiHall, Gorton, was severely heckled by the local unemployed, wholed by p.H, Kealey, the divisional organiser, put a series efquestions prepared by. the National Administrative Council ofUnemployed for &quot;use .all ever the country.Mrs. Thring-went , to Manchester at the end of last weekand has reported to the National Admistrative Council ofUnemployed that the Manche stor&apos; cemmittee is much annoyed by tinoutstanding accunte for lodgings for delegates to the National 1 Conference last year for which the. bianch considers headquarter! are responsible.   The term granted to Mrs. Thring for payment 1her fine in connection with1 &quot;Out of Work&quot; expired on February 3i and her visitors t. to Manchester was possibly an attempt te avoidtho consequences.- Increased activity in the textile industry has led to slij improvement in Yerkshiro but &quot;unemployment is still acute in tha ceunty.   About 1,000 of the Leeds unemployed demonstrated befon the Council on February 1st: the deputation complained that tin relief work started by the Council was inadequate.   The Euddersfield Unemployed Committee has issued a manifesto to all lopal trade union branches in vhioh the identity of interests -between the employed and the unemployed is stressed.My. Birmingham correspondent reports a slight decrease in the     unemployment figures in his area but states that the extremists continue their activity.   There is some &quot;unrest in Worcester where the payment for relief work has been reduced fljjj l/- te 10ld.;per hour:   the. present secretary is said to be a moderate man but it.is reperted that a representative of the National Administrative Council will shortly visit the distri0&apos;1 At Leamington, ,-Warwiok and Rugby the unemployed are asking tothigher relief, and at Halosewen the unemployed are protesting. against/
against the..&quot;starvation&quot; wage of 9d. per-hour suggested for relief work:    their action is supported &quot;by the unemployed of Walsall and Smethwlck,    At West. Bromwich the unemployed ere agitating for increased relief and have been told by   Mansell of the Oldbury Trades and Labour Council that &quot;tho only way to get anything is by demonstrations and not by peaceful deputations.&quot;   It was stated at a meeting of unemployed&apos; held in Handsworth on January 30th that Mr,. Arthur Henderson, M.P., was arranging with Mr. H.O. Roberts, M.P., for a question to- be asked in the House of Commons regarding the recent arrest of the five unemployed at West Bromwich.v..   The unemployed in the East Midlands are much concerned regarding the working of overtime in local factories: raids have beenmade &apos;and .further action is contemplated: the engineers&quot; are particularly &quot;Bitter.About 350&apos;men&apos; have joined an unemployed committee which has been set up. to cover the. Mansfield , Wood house,: WUrsop, St an ton Hill and Sutton area and. which is affiliated to the National Administrative Council of Unemployed.   There is a slight decrease in the number of unemployed .in Coventry but the position, is still serious:   large quantities of printed slips bearing the words . &quot;No &quot;Work No Rent&quot; are be4ng distributed among, the; unemployed. ..&apos;-/--&apos; t, ;    The only&apos;demonstration, in, Gateshead last week was held in the Town.Hall on February 2nd and was attend.ed by about 300 people.George   Ebury,&quot; formerly divisional .or&apos;gahiser of the CommunistParty in Yorkshire, is how in Plymouth organising the&quot; unemployed: he has reported to the. National Administrative Council that the Plymouth .unemployed were be ing &quot;exploited by the.

THE COMMUBISTSThe ,Erecutive of the Communist Party is devotingmuch attention to a prospective general election and hasstarted a parliamentary committee, the secretary of whicli3 A.E. Cook, formerly secretary of the South WalesDivisional Council of the Communist Party.     Cook, whohad come experience of election work in the Caerphillyhye-election last year, wrote to a Communist official inLancashire on February 4th:&quot;We have now a special department in charge of tho Blectorial (sic) work of the Communist Party, and in order to assist that department, wo should like to impress on every branch chairman in those divisions that are to be contested that it possible a weekly report of progress and developments in connection with Communist candidature should be supplied, to the Central Office.   This report should give details as to the steps that have been taken bj .. the Branch in setting up Elect erial machinery,   Wort Committees, etc., the number and type of propaganda meetings held in the constituency, together with any other information that will be of value.   We -trust that every branch chairman will take this as ., an instruction to prepare and send a weekly re-oort to the Head Office.&quot; *My correspondents report a considerable change in the attitude of the Communist Party to other labour organisations:   Communists are making overtures to these bodies with the view of a compromise in regard to the next general election.     Last week William Gallacher, the vice-chairman of the Communist Party, urged a secret meeting of the Coventry branch to start an elect ion. fund and stated that headquarters would assist if the branch could collect about  300:   the branch was finally promie  200 for the local campaign if It would raise the Returning Officer&apos;s fet and other requirements:   Covert1 decided to write headquarters for a remittance on accaw&apos; and, as it only showed a profit of  1.10.3. for the lastf two months, local financial prospects are not bright. ,Gallacher/
Gallacher made the significant admission that Communistheadquarters had had money guaranteed by &quot;another country&quot;when the.&quot;general election takes place.Evidence&apos; that the Cbdmunists are making preparations inthe constituencies is contained in the following reportrecently sent by the secretary of the Openshaw branch of theCo.amun.ist, Party to Harry Pollitt, prospective Communistcandidate for Gorton:.- &quot;We have&quot;commenced the addressing of the envelopes from the register and also got down to the setting up of the Ward Committees-.   The system which we have adopted is to split up the membership, according to the situation -V     of their-homes and to appoint a leader for each section. These leaders &quot;will, then constitute the Election Committee with the co-operation of other Comrades Inside the Branch,   The question of the financing of the election is receiving very full consideration and a special committee is set up to think out .all the most effective ways and means of raising money.   We are getting going a;Stop-watch competition and also collecting books are. being got out for the m!eiabers.   A circular will be -drafted to the Trade Union Branches in tho District...&quot;The position as far as-Hodge is concerned is very s.S;Q.pd from our point, of view. , Many branches of the trade unions have protested to- the Trades Council .        against the&apos;adoption of Hodge and the names of these branches are&apos; being tabulated&apos;.   The - unemployed have now been allowed affiliation to the Trades and Labour Council and this will strengthen our position on the ,. Council.     We have now got 21 delegates who are members ..  &apos;. of the. Party   on the Council and 2 members on the V ., B.0, of the Council...&quot;:The acting secretary   of the Communist Party Executivehas sent to all branches&apos; a circular &quot;which should be issuedas the; basis of election, addresses&quot;, in the municipalelections :.  the, following&apos;extracts are&apos;taken from this document: -&apos;11 &quot;In the election about to take place we appeal to: you-to-show your ,sense of class solidarity.   The Communist;Party knows.:.hp&apos; other basis of appeal, whether national\&apos;pr local elections,   The class issue  -the never-ceasing struggle between^the working class and the privileged class     dominates this and every other action.:of &quot;our daily lives&quot;We are fiiliy aware of the limitations of municipal activity.   A thousand checks and counter-checks have been devised by the governing class to prevent the workers obtaining control over local governing bodies. Parliament bars the way and,working class councillors are threatened, with ;expehsive&apos;lawsuits when any municipal Council is audacious enough to overstep the bounds carefully set by &quot;the-1 vested interests.Distress/
m   8   -Distress&quot;The Communist Party demands that the full powers of the local Council be used for the relief of distress The excuse that their powers are limited cannot be admitted here.   If necessary, these limitations must be broken through and the workers&apos; representatives take their stand with those of Poplar, Bethnal Green, Stepnsj and other places.   Above all, the relief granted must neither be given nor taken as charity.   We affirm the right of the physically disabled to full and free maintenance.Unemployment&quot;The above applies here also,- In both oases, moreover, the problem is a national rather than a local one and the definite policy of the Council should be to compel the Government to shoulder the burdens created by the continued oxi3tence of the Capitalist regime. This policy, however, must never be allowed to providi municipal councillors with an excuse for shirking their own responsibility.&quot;The Communist Party demands work for the uneraploy or full maintenance at Trade Union rate of wages.   All the resources of local administration must be used to meet this demand and to compel the national administration to accept responsibility.   We ask the workers, in short, to wage a double fight; on the one hand against existing misery and distress and on the other against the capitalists and their Government who are responsible.   The worker in employment, no less thai he who is unemployed, has a direct interest in this demand.   To-day it is the turn of his workmate: to-morrow it may be his own.Police&quot;We affirm that a Workers1 Party could, and should use the public powers to aid the workers in their day to day class struggle.   They could use their authority! over the police (so far&apos; as the government has left they any authority) to put an end to the repression of working olass opinion.     They could refuse to protect blacklegs brought into a district by the bbss class for the purpose of beating down the workers&apos; level of existence.Housing&quot;The failure of the Municipal Councils to deal with this problem is tragic and complete.   With the Government they must take their share of responsibility Overcrowding should be ruthlessly suppressed, within the law if possible, outside the law if necessary.  A rigid rationing of house accommodation must be carriflij lout with the assistance of the Trade Unions and Unemployment Committees.&apos; - &quot; .     Rates&quot;All these, measures, if carried out, will and must mean an increase of rates.   Because of the house shortage and the Rent Restriction Acts, the propertyovmers/
owners are able, as never before, to shift the burden on to the shoulders of the Workers.    In these circumstances it is the duty of the Workers&apos; Party to see that the rates are assessed and levied in tho Capitalist quarters and upon Capitalist factories, etc., to the utmost -possible extent.   We must never allow payment of rates to . reduce the amount we require to purchase food and --clothing for ourselves and our families.. &quot;But, even though the granting of relief to the distressed means that the municipality must declare itself bankrupt there must be no hesitation in deciding upon relief.     Tho bankruptcy of the municipality merely involves loss of revenue to a class of financial exploiters and speculators.     Moreover, the fight for national responsibility for the relief of distress will -,&apos; be carried a stage further.Capitalism the Evil&quot;Unemployment, overcrowding, and general distress are direct results of the Capitalist system.     No local authority can do more than relieve some of the &quot;worst effects of that system.   Its complete abolition&apos;is the task of the revolution, and, therefore, the Imperative - duty of the workers,&quot;In the meantime, starvation must not be tolerated without a protest.&quot;The Communist Party therefore urges you to take part in municipal elections; to use local administration for the purpose of relieving distress; to oapture the machinery of local Government so. that it may be used for and not against you.   Let your slogans be:&quot;&quot;Work or full maintenance for the unemployed. &quot;Neither slums nor mansions, but house room for all. &quot;Food for the destitute.   The right to live for all. &quot;All power to the workers.&quot;The &quot;industrial policy&quot; of the Communist Party,towhich reference has been made in previous reports, hasnow been published in pamphlet form and there is no doubtthat&apos;the Communist officials are alive to the advisability,from their point of view, of exploiting Industrial unrest.On February 2nd the following&apos;letter   was sent to theScottish organiser by A.E. Hawkins, who has been madeindustrial secretary of the party:;&apos;JAs you are probably, aware, the A.E.U. have just, turned down the Employers&quot; proposals on overtime, which were backed by the recommendation of their Executive, by a majority of approximately two to one. This result is fairly satisfactory from our point of view,, although we in the London Division are somewhat disappointed as our own figures show a majority of somewhere about six to one against. -&quot;However, we are now making our preparations for the next move by the Union Executive.   Following the usual practice they will probably get the termsslightly/
slightly amended by the employers and then present then to the members again for a second ballot.    The usual thing in suoh cases is that the active elements curse the Executive and&apos; boycott the ballot.   We do not want this to happen again, and I should be very glad therefore if yo,u could let me know to what extent we have influence in the A.E.U. in your area, and&apos;what steps you might be able to take to ensure that if the matter comes to a second ballot the majority against will be larger than on the first occasion.&quot;We are fortunate in London in having captured the London District Committee of the Union and haying their whole-hearted co-operation.   They are arranging a series of mass meetings of A.E.U. members in various parts of London.   Possibly if you&quot;have any Party members oh the local District Committee of tho Union you may be able to take some similar steps.   In any case I shall be glad to know what is the actual position in your area.&quot;There are indications that officials of the A.E.U., who havebeen negotiating- with the employers are being plied withstock questions emanating from Communist sources whenaddressing union meetings,Gommunists have been active among the London dockersand intend to extend their propaganda to other, ports:W.J. Sturrbck, who was one of the unsuccessful candidates for tho presidency of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside andGeneral Workers1 Union in December last, is in communicationwith tho industrial secretary of the&apos; Cormnuuist Party, towhom he wrote on February 6th:&quot;Having got the London Dockers&apos; Section of the Transport and General Workers1 Union on the move, they have decided to send. 4 members to different ports to put before them the decision   &quot; of the rank and file of London and also get the,: -feeling in the ports.   They, have decided in London to accept no reduction of wages, no lengthening of hours and no spread-over.   II. Maguire and &apos; j. Fitzgerald are going to the ports of Liverpool, Grimcby, Hull, etc.    (Jfeguire Party member); DeLarge, Glasgow, etc.   North (Party member]; IvL I&amp;son (wants watching) Parry, Bristol, Cardiff, Swansea, etc., South.     They are leaving on Wednesday night next as delegate conference has been called for Wed. 15th &apos;so they will be away about a.week.   Can you furnish ,me with names and addresses of active Party in any of the ports so that I can let then, have them before they go, say let-me have them by.Wednesday morning. Suggest you write to anyone in the ports stating that they get prepared so as to make it more effective. I think this will also give us alittlo idea of how our Party organisation stands and will act as a tost. There has been no information to go out, nobody knows what ports or when they are going, this is being kept so to keep office-Cjials in the dark..1-&apos;In/
In this connection, it is reported on the authority of a single informant who attended a meeting&apos; of members of the above Union in Canning- Town on February 5th, that a,majority of tho men in Bow, Poplar, Sast and West Ham, Ley ton and Ilford and at the London County Council Depot ia opposed to a strike.   One of tho speakers nevertheless remarked that &quot;It is puite possible that there will be a strike,&quot;Walton Howbould has been discussing the industrial features of &quot;The Communist&quot; with P., W. Postdate and T, A. Jackson, respectively oditor and sub-editor of the paper, and has suggested that industries be   grouped under headings such as mining, iron, steel and kindred trades, engineering and shipbuilding, metal and chemical, distributive and. warehousing, transport, textile and general end a page article devoted to one section on alternative weeks by authoritative writers: Newbouldrs plan is supported by William Gallacher and the articles, if published, will be supplementary to those which now appear over the name of John Ball.   Kewbould and. Gallacher are of opinion that the sugvested articles would make considerable appeal to Trade Unionists.The Divisional Communist secretary in South Wales hascircularised all lodges of the South Wales Miners&apos; federation on behalf of the Russian famine Fxuid pointing out that:&quot;The Russian working-class have a right to call upon tho British working-class for assistance, and particularly those who are minors, as during the lockout they :   contributed the largest sum in cash towards the funds of the M.F.G.B. with a view to assisting all British minersto resist the onslaught of tho Coal Barons to reduce the standard of living of the miners.&quot; , \fit will be remembered that tho sum actually received by theBritish miners from Russia was 2,015,222 roubles.)&quot;The Cofirjunist&quot; waxes hysterical about the &quot;vendetta&quot;against its members in the current issue, devotes two pages tothe cases at West Bromwich, Rochdale,, and. South Shields and demands/
demands the release of Inkpin:   the descriptions of the van cases are not remarkable for their accuracy and it is doubtful if the latter would have received much attention had Inkpin not been imprisoned.     My correspondents state that the propaganda on behalf of Inkpin has fallen very flat in the provinces, although all Communist branches have been instructed by hoadquarters to agitate against tho &quot;vendetta&quot; R. Palme Dutt, the Communist editor of the &quot;labour Monthly&quot; has sent to the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; a letter in which he suggests that the theses and statutes of the Communist International should be republished by &quot;representative leaders of opinion or organisations&quot; as a protest against Inkpin1 s c onviqtiqn.On the application of Mr. J.H. Thomas, M.P., a receiver has been appointed of the Rational Labour Press Limited, in respect of tho  2,000 damages awarded in his recent libel case:   Mr0 Scott Puckers, tho solicitor to the National Labour Press, is reported to have said that the &quot;receivers^] will make no difference to the company, as the business is already being carried on by receivers appointed by the debenture holders, and that there will bo little or nothing for Mr. Thoriia31.. receiver to receive,&quot; -The largest Communist meeting held in London during the week was at Eattersea Town Hall, where about 600 people were present on February 5th:   the speakers, frank Smith, J.J. Taughan, Mayor of Bethnal Green and Frank Tanner, attacked me-members  of the Government and eulogised the - Soviet system:   Tanner said that tho Communist policy was &quot;eventually to obtain the reins of Government and the power of the parliamentary machine and use.it relentlessly against all who would oppose them,&quot;Communist meetings in tho provinces tend to foster class hatred and emphasised tho desire of the speakers to
join forces with the Labour Party, not, as one man put it,because they like it, but to undermine it and get rid of menlike Thomas:   the Communist Party might alter its tactics,but its end was always the same, revolution.   Addressinga crowd of 500, many of whom had waited sow time inextreare cold, in Manchester on February 5th, Clarke ofAltrincham said:&quot;Why do we come out here at all?   I will tell you.   The reason is because we want to alter the existing system of society under which those who own everything do nothing, while those who produce everything own nothing.   That is how the present system of society operates, and who can say such a system ought not to be swept away.   The system operates in favour of a few lazy greedy stinking parasites, who thieve and rob you of the fruits of your labour.   You sweat so that these lazy tykes can live in luxury.   You and your families starve in order that these wastrols can live their useless Jives.   It is a system of slavery for you, and you cannot alter things by any other way than by revolution...   The Capitalist system is collapsing, but before its final extinction the workers of this country will die in their thousands of - hunger and starvation.     The Coramunists want to minimise this as much as possible and that Is why wo are- trying for a speedy revolution.   We don&apos;11 minco matters.   We are out for revolution.   We are out to bring about&apos; revolution in this country by force.   Yes, you say, but the Communists cannot prevent their speakers being persecuted now.   Wo shall have our answer when the time comes.   Force will be necessary because tho other sido will use force... We are accused of causing unrest and disaffection amongst the workers. Wo are out for that very purpose, we don&apos;t pake any bones about it.   If the workers were satisfied they would never revolt and so we are out to make them dissatisfied.     Satisfied people won&apos;t revolt.   We . are out to exploit the unemployed they say.   Of course we are.     Ever since the early days of the trade depression the&apos;Communists throughout the country organised the unemployed, appointed unemployed committees, led deputations to the Boards of Guardians and the other local authorities, and through the efforts of the Communists alono the unemployed have got all the relief that has come their way,&quot;My Coventry correspondent, who is particularly wellinformed, sends the following report: ,  *&quot;The political situation in Coventry at the  -present time is worthy of careful attention.   Due -&apos;      , to the tireless activities of the-local extremists, and tae-national leaders of the revolutionary movement, who cake such frequent visits to tills centre, the position.has been gradually gettingworse/

Addressinga crowd of 500, many of whom had waited so-ne time in extreme cold, in Manchester on february 5th, Clarke ofAltrincham said:&quot;Why do we come out here at all?   I will tell you.    The reason is because we want to alter the existing system of society tinder which those who own everything do nothing, while those who produce everything own nothing. *   That is how tho present system of society operates, and who can say such a system ought not to be swept away.   The system operates in favour of a few lazy greedy stinking parasites, who thievo and rob you of the fruits of your labour.   You sweat so that these lazy tykes can live in luxury.   You and your families starve in order that these wastrols cam live their useless Jives.   It is a system of slavery for you, and you cannot alter things by any other way than by revolution...   The Capitalist system is collapsing, but before its final extinction the workers of this country will die in their thousands of- hunger and starvation.     The Coaimunists want to minimise this as much as possible and that Is why we are-trying for a speedy revolution.   We don&apos;t minco matters.   We are out for revolution.   We are out to bring about&apos; revolution in this country by force,   Yos, you say, but the Communists cannot prevent their speakers being persecuted now.   Wo shall have our answer when the time comes.   Force will be necessary because tho other sido will use force.,. We are accused of causing unrest and disaffection amongst the workers. Wo are out for that very purpose, we don&apos;t make any bones about it.   If tho workers were satisfied they would never rovolt and so we are out to make thorn dissatisfied.     Satisfied people won&apos;t revolt.   We are out to exploit the unemployed they say.   Of course we are.     Ever since the early days of the trade depression the&apos;Communists throughout the country organised the unemployed, appointed unemployed committees, led deputations to tho Boards of Guardians and the other local authorities, and througch the efforts of the Communists alono the unemployed have got all the relief that has come thoir way,&quot;My Coventry correspondent, who is particularly wellinformed, sends the following report: ,  *&quot;The political situation in Coventry at the present time i3 worthy of careful attention.   Due to the tireless activities of the local extremists, and tne national leaders of the revolutionary movement, who make such frequent visits to this centre, the posit ion , has beon gradually gettingworse/
worse.     Now, with the proposed nomination of ja Leckie as Communist candidate for this constitute anti-constitutional propaganda is sure to become more intense,   Violent speeches by Tom Dingley, Leonard Jackson, and other local agitators, whiot now of almost daily occurrence, tako place ontire unchecked, and it is generally thought that tho a of serious trouble are being 30wn in the city, Two lye months ago these extremists had a comparav. small following in Coventry.   They were discredit! by tho great majority of the workers, and there i very little syir^athy for them when they were prog, The large amount of prolonged unemployment amongst engineering workers of this centre, however, has fertile soil for the Communist propaganda, and revolutionary doctrines are gaining much support o late. &apos; /The national leaders of&apos; tho.\Co.rnraunist movei make a -special mark of Coventry, and such mon as James.

AND HOME COUNTIES DIVISIONAL &quot;COUNCIL 6T TEB OOI^JHISlg PABTY &apos;This council, which consists of Arthur Slfleet,H.W, Inlcpin, Bert Joy (&quot;Tooting Trotsky&quot;), G. Deacon,F. Tanner, B. Bishop, T. Irving, A. Squair, Mrs. Thring,Mrs. Walker and Minnie Birch, held a secret meeting onFebruary 5th, when the following: report was submitted:&quot;The general development of the Party within the area continues to be satisfactory.   New branches have been established at Kingston, Cowes, Dover and Kennington.     The Central and Soho branches were amalgamated for more efficient working,the Earlsfield branch, an offshoot of Tooting branch has been temporarily disbanded, the Camberwell branch which operated mostly in the area oovered by Peckham, was merged in tho Kennington branch; the Konnington branch once lapsed, has now been revived.   East Kent branch is merged in Dover, the Hampstead branch is considering removing its activities to Kilbujrn which is more working class, and the Wppd Green branch, temporarily disorganised is now firmly re-established.   The Stepney branch, which covered an unduly large area has split in two to form a Mile End branch.&quot;In all its political and industrial activity the Committee has been strictly careful to try and interpret the decisions of the International Theses.     The Industrial Beport is separately given.   Arising from &apos; the discussion at the last Divisional Council meeting, a very detailed instruction was circulated to all branches regarding the relations with the unemployed, &apos; the local trades councils and.the local labour parties, and with endeavours :to secure co-opers.tion between the organised workers and the unemployed movement.   This programme has been-largely carried out by the branches with the result that reports are now coming to hand cf drastic alterations in the personnel and outlook of the trades councils...&quot;With regard to the position tov/ards the local Labour Parties, the instructions were issued having regard to the decision of thy? Party Conference and the instructions of the International.   Nevertheless, a &apos; -   certain amount of dubiety exists in the branches, partly because of the indefinite result cf the National application for affiliation to the Labour Party.   This indefiniteness should, soon be removed as a result of the forthcoming Policy Conference.   This indecision oan also be partly attributed to tho peculiarities of. local/
local circumstances. Nevertheless, great progress has &apos;1. made in the local labour Parties and the Party is more M more becoming a force which they have to take into accotl&quot;At the London labour Party Conference the questiojf of Party affiliation came up for consideration. [Instruotiors were given to bur delegates and the result I was that whilst the spirit of the delegates was obvioualB in our favour a compromising resolution was carried whicB deferred it for consideration by the National Labour Paifi Executive. Had it not been for the pacifio tendencies cH the heroes of Poplar we might even have succeeded in j removing that bulwark of reaction, Herbert Morrison, fjJ his office end place of influenco. j&quot;When the by-election became due in Southwark your I Executive had to make a definite decision.   It w^s obviously impossible for the Party to run an opposition candidate, and very unpolitical in the circumstances to , oppose the Labour candidate.   Your committee therefore difl what seemed the most useful thing by preparing a \questionnaire and submitting It to Naylor as agreement tof the clauses of which was to be the price of our support,! Naylor signed the questionnaire with but one political qualification.   He no?/ stands committed to that questionnaire and our branches will be expected to see til he lives up to his undertaking.   He has since sent a lettl to the branch in which he indicates that his success at poll wa3 due to Communist support.&quot;Our Comrades J.J. Vaughan and Walter Windsor have i been selected by the Bethnal Green Trades Council to contest both the parliamentary and L.C.C. elections. Comrade Saklatvala has been, selected parliamentary candidate by the Battersea Labour Party, and A.A. Watts 1 for the LaC.C. by the same body.     C.L. Ifelone will again stand at Leyton under direct Party auspices and W. McLaihe has been provisionally selected by the Parliamentary Committee to contest Walthamstow,   Other   I seats both parliamentary and L.C.C. are under considerati&quot;The influence of the party amongst the unemployed b improved greatly and it can be rightly said that the Communist Party is responsible for its efficient organise and policy.&quot;The speakers Classes for unemployed members had to be temporarily dropped owing to the disorganisation consequent upon the removal of&quot;bffloes.     Now that we are clear they have been restarted and should be effective in producing speakers for the coming summer months.&quot;The publication of literature has been held up through lack of funds.   A very useful leaflet was issued under the title of TAn open letter to members of the Kiddle Class1,     The first print was quickly distributed and a reprint will be undertaken as soon a3 funds permiti&quot;A new leaflet &quot;What1a wrong with the Engineering Trades?&apos; has been published in a large edition, and we anticipate that it will have a very useful effect.&quot;The monthly issue of the &quot;London Organiser&quot; had to be temporarily suspended because the orders coming to hand&apos;did not reach tho minimum-anantIty which the printer would run off at tho price.   M.v&quot;-- thousands of the lastIssue,
-i7- 145issue had to ho given away free to branches and the L,D.C, could not afford to continue it.   A suggestion has been made that the &quot;London Organiser1 should be prepared by tho L.D.C. but issued nationally.   If this is done It will enable us to successfully continue its publication,&quot;Up till   the end of November the I/tonthly Record was published regularly and was in fairly good demand. But we discovered then that some branches had beon accumulating large numbers of unsold copies and were returning them.   This seems to indicate that there is not the general desire for it that we thought and so the current issue has been held back.   Roughly speaking it paid for itself, but we want branches to purchase it because it Is useful, not merely because it is for sale. We venture to say that several of the articles on organisation in recent issues were of great value, because several branches have written statin;, their -appreciation.   Suggestions and a decision of Its continuation will be necessary,&quot;We have had a very unfortunate experience with the local Joint Councils.   In no si^glo instance do they seem to have worked satisfactorily, and we want the Council at this sitting to deeido on their future.    It would seem that their functions are so indefinite and their authority with the branches so vaguo that they are unable to operate and secure the co-operation of the branches.   Unlike the Divisional Bxeoutive or Divisional Council they had no constitutional authority to enforce their decisions, and so it becor/es a matter of will with the branches as to whether anything is done or not.   We are informed that the establishment of Joint Councils as part of the National Constitution will be diecuosod at tho National Party Policy Conference, arising from tho Theses on Organisation.   The discussion at this Council meeting will give ua a guide for the larger conference.   Meanwhile wo recommend that where co-operation between adjacent branchos is possible for givon objects, it should be encouraged and acted upon.&quot;Ordinary propaganda has been very difficult these past few months.   Apart from the ordinary winter suaponaion indoor meetings have been rather scarce bocause of tho expense and tho groat unemployment.    In addition the fow outdoor meetings have suffered because of the influenza epidemic which has attacked many speakers,&quot;Arising from the decisions of tho last Divisional Council the Area Councils wcro circulated with a view to holding meetings designed for the purpose of educating tho members.   Despite the many avowals that such lectures woro wanted we have to report that they have not beon successful.   Either tho area council has not takon the matter up, or where they have the lectures have been very poorly attended.   Nevertheless, mainly through CP. initiative many educational classes are being held under Central Labour College auspices.&quot;Arrangements have now been made for an interchange of Executive Delegates between tho Young Communist      v League and the Divisional Executive,   We understandthat/
Ml    10    **that the development of the Y.C.L. in London has Leon very satisfactory, and it is hoped that this interchange of representatives will lead to a closer oo-oper&amp;tion and the extension of the Y.C.L. in London.&quot;Steps are now being taken to push forward tho WomenT s Movement....a&quot;A special series of lectures were arranged to be, delivered by co-operative and educational guilds      This was circulated through the branches and individuals when we are in touch with and the consequence lias been a very large demand for the lectures which has enabled us to reach districts where we have no branches and to get In touch with sympathisers in those places.&quot;It will be recollected that a system was initiated for the regular collection of individual written reports from members.   Our attention was drawn to the fact that the new Theses advocates in preference verbal reports; we have therefore decided to discontinue the issue of these but emphasise the need of comrades giving verbal reports to their branches and for branch chairmen to send in regular written reports of branch work.&quot;The system of voluntary organisers has not yet fully developed.     But the three or four comrades who have operated have done very good work indeed, work which indicates the desirability of estending the system.&quot;It is often complained that there is a lack of contact between the branches and the committee. Arrangements have now been made for the offico to be open every Saturday afternoon so that branch officers who desire to discuss anything with the organisers will. be able to oall and straighten matters out.&quot;The following extracts are taken from the Industrial ort;A.E.U. ,   &apos;&quot;Seven candidates run for the District Committee^ Six returned on the first.ballot and the seventh a       \ practical certainty on the second ballot.   Comrade Ellis goes to second ballot for Chairman of District CoraraitteeX and will probably get it.   It is now necessary to havo aN second complete list of candidates ready, as the present District Co emittee with nine Party members out of twenty-four looks like getting suspended by the E.C. of the Union,Woodworkers&quot;Three members of the Party were run as candidates for the London Management Committee and two were successful.Printers and Paperworkorst&quot;One candidate run for E.C. and was successful,N.U.Q.W.&quot;four candidates supported by the Party were successful in the elections for the^London District Committee.Post/
THE/Peat Office Engineers&quot;Only party members nominated secured election to the B.C,Transport and General Workers&quot;Two comrades were run for Goneral Secretary and President respectively.   In spite of many difficulties and the nature and tactics of the official opposition, our candidates socured 7042 and 4045 votos respectively.     This result la good whon it is noted that of these votoa 3310 and 3500 respectively came from tho london area.Furnishing Trades Association&quot;This Group was successful in retaining thoir seat on the E,C. of the Union and seriously threatened the position of the other B.C. member for London.&quot;A Central Industrial Advisory Committee has been set up for the purpose of working out a detailed policy to be advocated by our members in the various unions.   Since its inception this committee has beon asked by the E.C, of the Party to extend its field of operations to take in the whole country.&quot;The W.U.E. Group which is now functioning, has formed itself into a rank and file committee for the purpose of raising a fund in the&apos; B.U.B. to meet the legal expenses of the recent libel action. .&quot;Many important T,U, decisions have been largely affected by the efforts of the various industrial groups.   Among these mey be mentioned the Engineering Ballots on the LS-^reduct ion and the removal of overtime restrictions.   In the latter case the London voting was&apos;at least five to one against.     Similarly the building group have boon active in uniting the forces of the building workers to resist the threatened attack on hour...&quot;Members should always make a point of informing the L.D.C. of any forthcoming ballots or elections in their Union in sufficient time to allow the Party machinery to bo set in motion.,*Co- opera ti ve Organ! sat ion&quot;A good ticket is being run for the various committees of the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society and there is every prospect of their being successful.   With regard to the forthcoming elections to the London society a difficulty has arisen.     The rules of the society lay down rather stringent conditions for election and there is a difficulty in finding suitable candidates for election,   Various members of the party have beon approached but the response up to the present has been very bad indeed. ....The financial report ia misleading in that it does not show salaries or office expenses but it does disclose the fact that the actual members of tho Communist Party in London number about 1,700, 840 of whom are paying weekly subscriptions.
THE YOUJIGCOHLIUIIIST LEAGUEA highly confidential document which has come into myhands contains &quot;Instructions to University Groups of the&quot;Young Communist League&quot;, which were drawn up at a meeting 01December 12th.    It is here laid down&quot;That students&apos; groups should be,, not branches owing financial obligations to headquarters, but nuclei of student members of the Y.C.Lo subordinate, to the Executive of the Y.C.L. carrying on communist work in the Universities and        organised for that specific purpose ...&quot;That all members of students&apos; groups should become individual members of the Y.C.L., either as members of a branch near their homes or direct as individual members at headquarters.   On this under-standing students&apos; groups were excused all financial obligations to headquarters ...&quot;That the main function of the students&apos; groups must be intensive education.    Groups would have for reasons of expediency to be secret: any extensive propaganda being done to individual students&apos; group, although the group would secretly organise their propaganda beforehand.&quot;A list of Communist books to be studied was given.The Labour Grout) at Cardiff UniverEity has affiliatedto the University Socialist Federation in which .there are several Communists and is in touch -with Maurice Dobb, whoruns the Cambridge Young Communist group and is one of themore able and active organisers. .   .   &apos;The working class side of the Young Communist Leagueis devoting attention to the Scout Movement and endeavouringto prevent boys and girls joining, but so far&quot; the League.      has made very little progress in London. or in the provinces.The Liverpool group, which,, does not;appear to be numerous,has affiliated with, the Labour College.v, ; ;..;:AW INDUSTRIAL WORKER O:\TH5 fOBLD DEPORTEE,The following extracts are taken from a.letter dated Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, January 18th, 1922, and written toTom/
&quot;RUSSIAN -INFORMATION AND REVIEW&quot;The last issue of this journal, which is published by the Information Department of the Russian Trade Delegation, is, in the words of one of the Dutts, &quot;approaching the danger zone&quot; of political propaganda-    This applies particularly to an article entitled &quot;Russia and the Genoa Conference&quot; in which reference is made to &quot;the persistent campaign of lies about what is happening in Soviet Russia, a campaign which is freely subsidised by the Western Governments.&quot; . .Emile Burns, who was formerly a member of the -British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions, edits this publication.&apos;gX- INSPECTOR SYMEEx-Inspeotor Syme addressed another meeting of about 350 people in Trafalgar Square on February 25th:    the proceedings, which were in accord one   with the usual programme, call for no comment.HARRY/Tom Mann, by Charles Asbleigb, one of the industrial workers of the World deportees, whose cases are being dealtwith on this side by tne Lansbury-Larkin Committee:&quot;I am to be deported - and soonl   Have already written several articles for the Labor press and made a couple of talks and the American Government pays me the compliment of wanting to get rid of me.TI put up as good a  -fight as I could in the I.W.W. for affiliation ...&quot;Whatever I can do in England for the R. I.L.U., you may depend on me.    The name of ship on which I I am to be deported, and the port of destination and date of arrival, will all be cabled to W. N. Ewer of the Herald, as soon as I know,   For I want someone to meet roe on that side.   Publicity often prevents high-handed action by the agents of the bosses.    So keep in touch with Ewer.&quot;
HARRY POLL ITT -On January 31st Pollitt left 39rl in for Riga and expected to be in Moscow the following Sunday:   while in -Berlin he conferred with German members of the Red International of Labour Unions and on his return to that^city intends to have a conference with the &quot;German comrades&quot;, Rosmer and Watkins.TH2S &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot; rThe &quot;Daily Herald&quot; which has not gained in dignity since it has received the Trade Union subsidy, is pouring out a stream of vituperation against Parliament:    on February 7th it devoted a column to &quot;The Wasters&apos; Funeral&quot;, while its leader began &quot;The most discredited and corrupt Parliament of modern times opened its last, session to-day&quot; and declared that the Prime Ministers &quot;long long record of make believe and charlatanism is at an end.   He has bluffed and bullied, cajoled and lied too often ever to be trusted again.&quot;On February 8th the leader was devoted to the King&apos;s Sooeoh: &quot;The so-called &apos;Eing&apos;s Speech&apos; - that is to say, the Government&apos;s retrospect of achievement and promise of activity&apos; is, this time, even more deplorable and more impudent than usual.&quot;&apos;Small as is the &quot;Daily Herald&apos;s&quot; circulation, its venom, when applied to Government policy and to Parliament is nossibly more effective than when industrial matters are in question,, as its readers have less opportunity of testing its accuracy,Ln view of the approaching election for Parish and District Councils and Boards of Guardians, significance attaches to the paper&apos;s demand   for the immediate introduction of legislation to/
i ** 23 -to remove the v^TWqillillYication imposed on candidates by the receipt of Poor Law Belief.A writer in the current issue of &quot;Justice&quot; expresses the opinion that the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; will, in the future, &quot;require subsidies and heavy subsidies&quot; and that the General Council of the Trade Union Congress and the Labour Party &quot;simply cannot find the money necessary to keep it going for another six months - at least not out of grants and subscriptions from their constituent unions and organisations.&quot;ISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINIrish rosidents of Groat Britain arc not showing the same keen interest in political matters as heretofore; possibly % reaction after the extreme tension of the past two years. Irish Self-Determination League meetings are becoming irregular, the attendance sparse, and many of the branches are showing signs of collapse.The result of the Irish Race Congress in Paris has been disappointing to its promoters.     De Valors, after giving a solemn pledge that It should not be used for party purposes,j managed to secure six out of the seven places on the committeeI of the new organisation for his supporters.   A split resulted and most of the colonial delegates have withdrawn from it.P.J, Kelly, one of the English delegates, and a supporteri of do Valera^ plan to cause trouble wherever possible, lost no time in getting to work.   He and Sean McGrath are addressing t meetings in Cardiff, Swansea and other Welsh centres protesting against the continued imprisonment of Irish &quot;political&quot; prisoners in this country,     A similar meeting is to be held on Sunday next (12th) in Trafalgar Square,   All the London extremists. Including Art 0&apos;Brieji, Alderman IvJortimer andI P.D. 0&apos;Harte are to speak.1Leaders of the Irish Self-Determination&quot;League in London, and also some of those in the North, are decided Republicans,, o and/
and there Is reason to believe that word has been received from Ireland to create as much turmoil as possible with the object of upsetting the present Government and generally creating chaos.     How far they will succeed remains to be seon as the rank and file are strangely apathotic.The Cumann-na-mBan, or Women &quot;Volunteers, are the exception to the rule.   They are as fiery and determined as ever.   Their delegates, returning from a   Convention in Dublin, are said to have brought instructions to make special efforts to link up, as far as possible, with the Coaanunists and extreme labour and cause as much trouble as ever.. The Sfenn Fein Ard Fheis, arranged for the 7th February, was provisionally postponed till the 21st owing to railway dislocation arising out of the strike.     The D&amp;il Eireann meeting has also been postponed until the 20th.
