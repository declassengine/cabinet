Further discussion took place with regard to the period for which the British Exchequer should be responsible for this expenditure, end in discussion with Sir James Craig * the Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed to pay the cost of the Specials for the current financial tear 1921-22 (then put at  490*000 but now Estimated at  525,000);    and also the cost for tho first six months of 1922-23 (then estimated at  850,000).     Sir James Grai-g wishes for payment for a longer period, but this has at present been refused.The position therefore Is that the British Treasury has to pfovido for the coat of the Specials -(i)    for part of 1921-22,*(2)    for the first six months of 1922-23.Provision for (2) cannot be mads in any other way than by an estimate presented to Parliament,, the /total of which estimate&quot;mill appear -in the Civil Service -Vote on Account to -bo published in about &quot;ten days1  time am-, the details in &quot;tno ordinary published&quot;estimates.Similarly, &quot;parliamentary- authority must bo obtained for the &quot;expenditure - in the current year, and for this purpose it .ist!ft
proposed to present o.t onoo tho.-annexed Supplementary Estimate,A suggestion has been made that for 1921-22 Ulator should pay for tho Specials and bo compensated by rac jiving in respect- of the&apos;period from 22nd November, 1921, to 31st Maroh, 1922,a greater share of rovanue than she would, on normal principles,receive.        The oh j actions to this course aro(1) that.It -will not serve for 1922-23;(2) that it would nat giva real Parliamentary authority for tne o.j;pen .itura;(3) that it would raise a very doubtful inter-pratation of the maaning oi tho provisions of the Government of Ira land Act 12 20 relating to Rev aim a attributable to Ireland;(4) that it would give Ulster a sum of money in no way necessarily related to. -the cos!; of the-Specials.     It. might give hor ei bher too much ....,. or too; little.&apos; A neither suggestion has oaen made, that tho form of the Supplementary Estimate&apos;Should correspond with the more general form of that of the grant of  1,130,000-to Southern Ireland (Miscellaneous Services Ireland Grant).       As to this it should be said that, the purposes for which tho grant is to be made being specific and not miscellaneous, their description in the Estimate should be specific also.(Signed)     HILQJOH YOUNG *TREASURY, S.W..2Sth February, 19 22.
