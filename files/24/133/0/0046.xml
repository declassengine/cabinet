This Document !-His Britannic tVJaj&apos;0*.22616th. February, 1922,DRAFT COMMUNICATION TO THE SULTAN FROMTHE HIGH COMMISSIONER.Your Highness:-1, I have the honour to bring to your Highness&apos; notice that certain passages of explanatory note which 1 addressed to you on 3rd. December, 1921 were inter-&apos; preted, to my great disappointment, in a manner not in accordance with intentions and policy of His Majesty1s Government,Z.    Judging--by many comments which ..have been published on the subject of this note, it would appear that many Egyptians were under impression that Great Britain was about to abandon her liberal and favour-able attitude towards Egyptian aspirations, and to make use of her special position in Egypt in order to maintain a political and administrative regime incom-patible with freedom she had offered,3.     Such an interpretation of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government was quite mistaken.     On the contrary, the explanatory note emphasised the domin-ating principle that the guarantees claimed by Great Britain are not designed to involve the continuance of an actual or virtual protectorate,     Great Britain, as it is stated therein, sincerely desires to see &quot;an Egypt enjoying the national prerogatives and the in-t e mat io rial
international position of a sovereign state.4.    If Egyptians have regarded these guarantees as being out of keeping with position of a free coun-try they have, on the other hand, lost sight of the fact that Great Britain has been obliged to claim them out of consideration for her own security in face of a situation which demands great prudence on her part, particularly in the matter of the disposition of her troops.    Present world conditions, however, and the state of effervescence which has prevailed in K.\&apos;pt since the armistice are not permament factors, and it is to be hoped that while, on the one hand, the former will eventually improve, on the other hand, the time will come when, in the language of that note, Egypt&apos;s record will give confidence ininer own guarantees.5,    As to any desire to interfere in the inter-nal administraticn of Egypt, His Majesty&apos;s Government have sufficiently stated, and repeat, that their most ardent desire is to place in Egyptian hands the con-duct of their own affairs.    The draft agreement pro-posed by Great Britain did not depart from this idea, and in malting provision for the presence of two British officials in the Ministries of Finance and Justice, it was not her intention to use these two officials for the purpose of intervening in Egyptian affairs but solely in order to preserve the contact requisite for protecting foreign interests.6.    Such is the sole bearing of the guaranteesdemanded
22demanded by Great Britain,     Ttiey are claimed without any desire to impede Egyptians enjoying the full nights of a national Government.7,    Animated as she is with these intentions, it will be understood that it is repugnant to,Great Britain on the one hand to see Egyptians delay by their own acts the realisation of an ideal aimed at by both parties, and on the other to be compelled herself to intervene to re-establish order when it is threat-ened in such a way as to arouse the fears pf foreign-ers and to involve the interests of foreign powers. It would be much to be regretted if Egyptians should -see in the exceptional measures which have recently been taken any prejudice to the ideal to which they aspire or an intention on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to alter the policy I have indicated,    In taking these, measures, the sole desire of His Majesty1s Government has been to put an end to a harmful agita-tion which by arousing popular passions might have such consequences as to jeopardise the whole result of the efforts of the Egyptian nation.    These measures were taken primarily in the interest of the Egyptian cause, which has everything to gain by being studied in an atmosphere of calm and friendly discussion,8.    Now that tranquility seems to be re-estab-lishing itself thanks to the wise spirit which is the root of the Egyptian character and asserts itself in times of crisis, I am happy to be in a position to., communicate to Your Highness the attached declaration by
229by His Majesty&apos;s Government which will, I am confident, establish a regime of mutual confidence and lay the foundation for a satisfactory and final solution of the Egyptian problem.9.    There is no obstacle to the re-establishment forthwith of an Egyptian Ministry for Foreign Affairs which will prepare the way for the creation of the diplomatic and consular representation of Egypt,10.    The creation of a parliament with a right to control the policy and administration of a constitu-tionally responsible government is a matter for Your Highness and the Egyptian people to determine. Should circumstances arise to delay the coming into force of the Act of Indemnity with application to all inhabitants of Egypt mentioned in the declaration ac-companying this note, I desire to inform Your Highness that I shall be prepared, pending the repeal of the proclamation of the 2nd. November, 1914 to suspend the application of Martial Law in respect of all matters affecting the free exercise of the political rights of Egyptians.11.    It is now for Egypt to respond, and it is to be hoped she will justly appreciate the good in-contentions of Great Britain, and that reflection and not passion will guide her attitude.
