/193CONFIDENTIAL.7Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee to consider the Amendments to Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.A COMMITTEE consisting of representatives of the Foreign Office, Treasury, Board of Trade, Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry aud Cabinet Offices, assisted by Sir William Finlay, K.B.E., K.C., was called together by you in December last to consider and report on the amendments which had been adopted by the second assembly of the League of Nations to article 16 *of the Covenant the article which provides for the application of economic pressure by all the members of the League to a Covenant-breaking State.2. The amendments adopted by the second assembly have been embodied in four separate protocols for signature and ratification by the members of the League. It is therefore open to His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt one or more of these amendments without adopting all. The amendments embodied in each of the four protocols are as follows : (1.) &quot; The latter part of the first paragraph of article 16 of the Covenant shall read as follows : which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between . persons residing in their territory and persons residing in the territory of the Covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between persons residing in the territory of the Covenant-breaking State and persons residing in the territory of any other State, whether a member of the League or not.&apos;(2.) &quot; The second paragraph of article 16 shall read as follows : &quot; &apos; It is for the Council to give an opinion-whether or not a breach of the Covenant has taken place. In deliberations on this question in the Council the votes of members of the League alleged to have resorted to war and of members against whom such action was directed shall not be counted.&apos;(3.) &quot; The third paragraph of article 16 shall read as follows : &apos; &quot; &apos; The Council will notify to all members of the League the date which it recommends for the application of the economic pressure under this article.&apos;(4.) &quot; The fourth paragraph of article 16 shall read as follows : &quot; &apos; Nevertheless, the Council may, in the case of particular members postpone the coming into force of any of these measures for a specified period where it is satisfied that such a postponement will facilitate the attainment of the object of the measures referred to in the preceding paragraph, or that it is necessary in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience which will he caused to such members.&apos; &quot;The SecretaryForeign Office.Sir,February 1, 1922.to the Cabinet.714,   [77781B
First Amendment.3. The most important of these amendments is undoubtedly that which is contained in the first of the above protocols and provides for the substitution of the words &quot;persons residing in the territory&quot; for the word &quot; nationals&quot; as the persons whose relations are to be prevented with the covenant-breaking State.4. The committee have approached the consideration of this amendment upon the assumption that His Majesty&apos;s Government intend that the economic weapon provided for in article 1G should be regarded as an effective means of coercing a covenant-breaking State and that for this purpose its operation should be made as simple, as rapid and as universal as possible. The world-wide interests of British commerce and finance render it probable that Great Britain will experience the inconvenience of imposing the economic pressure more than any other State, and it is therefore important for British interests that the steps taken by the British Government should also be enforced by every other State in order that the cumulative effect may render the period for which the pressure must be applied as short as possible.5. The committee is well aware that the absence from the League of Nations of several important States renders the enforcement of the economic boycott under article 16 far more difficult than it would be if the League were universal, but it has not considered that this is a circumstance which should affect its consideration of the question referred to it.(i. The only question which the committee has left it necessary to consider is whether the purpose of article 16 can be achieved with the least detriment to British interests, (a) by the maintenance of the term &quot; nationals,&quot; the existing wording of article 1(5, or (A) by the adoption of the proposed amendment substituting residence as the test, or (c) by the adoption of some other wording.7. Whatever may have been the intention of the draftsmen of article 1(5 in its present form, the committee is satisfied that it is desirable that the word &quot; nationals &quot; should be modified. It is possible that if, in the corresponding French text of article 16 &quot; ressortissant&quot; had been used instead of &quot;national,&quot; general concurrence might have been obtained, for the view that the word &quot; nationals &quot; must be interpreted as covering all persons who were within the territory of the State concerned, as this would have been in accordance with the old rules of British belligerent practice, but in view of the word &quot;national&quot; having been used in the French text it seems inevitable that the word &quot;nationals&quot; in the English text should be assumed to have been employed with reference to nationality. The strong plea made by the Swiss both in 1920 and 1921 at the Assembly of the League for the substitution of the word &quot; residents &quot; for &quot; nationals &quot; was based largely upon the view that they could only take effective action for the enforcement of their obligations on those persons who were within their territory, and that in the case of a country whose foreign colonies are so large, as is the case of Switzerland, it was unreasonable that all persons within the territory should not be treated alike. It is only with regard to persons within its territory that a State can take rapid and effective action. The committee therefore consider that, as between nationality and residence, it is preferable to adopt residence as the test.S. It must be remembered, however, that the French delegation adopted an attitude of hostility towards the proposed amendment, and intimated a preference for the word &quot; nationals,&quot; and in view of the provisions of article 26 of the Covenant that no amendment can come into force until it has been ratified by each of the States permanently represented on the council, it is by no means certain that the proposed amendment can be brought into force; it is possible that the French may continue their attitude of opposition.9. The committee have, therefore, considered whether it might not be possible to combine both the ideas of residence and nationality and to substitute some such phrase as &quot; persons subject to the jurisdiction of the State&quot; for those who are to be covered by the prohibitions enacted by the State enforcing the boycott. The first paragraph of article 16 might, if this idea were adopted, be worded as follows : &quot; Should any member of the League resort to war .... it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other members of the League
which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between persons subject to their jurisdiction and persons in the covenant-breaking State, and tho prevention oil all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between persons in the covenant-breaking State, and persons in any other State whether a member of the League or not.&apos;&apos;10. There can he no doubt as to the right of a State to legislate for its own subjects abroad as well as for all persons in its territory, and if the obligation imposed upon each of the members of the League covered all persons subject to its jurisdiction, a foreigner carrying on business in a country would be affected not only by the enaot-meut issued by the local Sovereign, but also by those of his own Sovereign. The resulting effect  of an amendment on these lines would undoubtedly be to produce a more complicated machinery for enforcing the economic weapon and to depart, there-fore, from the standard of simplicity which is desirable, but, if the French could be induced to withdraw their opposition by the use &quot;of any such phrase, this disadvantage would be outweighed. It is also possible that the adoption of any such phrase would conduce to greater uniformity between the practice of all the members of the League in enforcing tins form of pressure. Great Britain, forced to issue enactments which would bind British subjects carrying on business abroad, could not allow them to be worse treated in the countries in which they carried on business than their competitors upon the spot, and Great Britain would therefore have a powerful handle for insisting upon the measures taken by the other countries concerned being enforced in the same manner as Great Britain was enforcing hers.11. The committee are therefore of opinion (a) that the word &quot;nationals&quot; in article 1(3 ought to be amended ; (6) that, if France can be induced to accept the amendment adopted at Geneva, it should be ratified by His Majesty&apos;s Government ; and (c) that, if France cannot be persuaded to ratify the proposed amendment, some such modification of paragraph 1. of the article should be proposed as a new amend-ment at the third assembly.Second Amendment.12. The purpose of this amendment is to confer upon the Council of the League the right to emit an opinion as to whether or not a breach of the Covenant of the League has been committed by a State. As article 16 stood in its original form, no indication was given as to whether any organisation or body was to consider this question ; consequently every State would have been left to decide the point for itself. It is needless to point out that in practice disputes might arise as to the origin of acts of aggression upon territory in which each party would endeavour to represent the other as the aggressor and itself as the victim. No confidence can be felt that the decisions arrived at by all the various members of the League would be uniform. It will therefore be an advantage that the role of the Council in this matter should be recognised, and in the opinion of the committee it is desirable that this amendment should be ratified.13. It is to be noted that by the terms of this amendment it is an opinion and not a decision which the Council is to give. Technically, the decision is to be taken by each individual State for itself, and under the resolutions adopted at Geneva, which provide that the minutes of the meeting of the Council at which the matter is under discussion shall be circulated to all the members of the League, facilities for such decision will be afforded in a way that may lead to a reasonable assumption that, the decisions by all the various members of the League will be identical.14. This amendment also provides that the votes of the alleged covenant-breaker, and of the member against whom such action is directed are not he counted. The purpose of this provision is to facilitate unanimous decisions on the part of the Council. If the resolutions adopted by the Council on such a point, were not unanimous, their moral force would be weakened and the effect diminished. The provision, therefore, appears to the committee to be a wise one. In all probability the provision is not essential, as it may well be argued ihat an &quot;opinion &quot;arrived at by the Council is technically not a &quot;decision,&quot; and therefore does not require to be unanimous, as it falls outside the scope of the first paragraph of article 5 of the covenant requiring unanimous decisions at meetings of the Council.[7778J B 2
Third Amendment.15. The third amendment provides for the notification by the Council to all members of the League of the date which it recommends for the application of the economic pressure.J6. The committee is of opinion that this amendment should be ratified. In practice the effect of the amendment will be that no State will enforce the economic boycott before similar action is taken by other States. This will be in accordance with British interests as it diminishes the risk of Great Britain applying this form of economic pressure and then finding that corresponding measures are not being taken by other States.Fourth. Amendment.17. The fourth amendment, which provides for a partial postponement of the measures taken in certain particular cases, represents the compromise which was arrived at on the amendments put forward and strongly supported by the Scandinavian States, under which it was to be possible for exemptions to be allowed in such cases. The movement in favour of the inclusion in article 16 of provisions enabling exemptions to be granted in the case of particular States is due to the experience of the late war, when some of the smaller European States maintained that it was both politically and economically impossible for them to sever all relations with Germany during the war without running the risk of attack. This point had been foreseen when the original draft of the Covenant was prepared and an attempt to meet it is to be found in the provision obliging all Members of the League mutually to support one another in resisting any special measures aimed.at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State. The Scandinavian States maintained that this provision was not enough to protect them, bat in the discussions at Geneva the representatives of the other States felt that they could not accept the principle of the grant of exemptions in the operation of the economic blockade and were not prepared to go further than the present amendment.IS. In the opinion of the committee this amendment represents a reasonable compromise on a very difficult question, and should be accepted by His Majesty&apos;? Government and ratified.19. The committee desire to draw attention to the unfortunate use of the word *.&quot; minimise &quot; in this amendment. The word has been repeated from the existing text of paragraph 3 without any adequate appreciation of the fact that the circumstances are not the same as those in which it was used in the original text. The purpose of these temporary postponements of the application of the boycott is not to &quot; minimise &quot; the loss and inconvenience to the members affected. The burden borne by all the members should in theory be identical, and. the purpose of the postponement is merely to make the smallest modification possible in favour of the State concerned consistently with rendering its position a possible one. It is, therefore, not the loss and inconvenience to the members which is to be minimised, but the change in the situation produced by the postponement. The point is not one of great importance, as it is not likely that any misunderstanding would arise as to the correct interpretation of the provision, but, if opportunity serves, the above point of view should be put on record.General.20. There is one other matter to which the committee desire to draw attention ; it is that the wording of some of the protocols does not seem to be very happy. When the protocol relating to the second amendment states that &quot;the second paragraph of article 1G should read as follows,&quot; it should be made clear that the amendment constitutes a new paragraph which is an addition to the article, and that the existing second paragraph will remain part of the article and become the third paragraph. The same difficulty arises in connection with the protocols embodying the third and fourth amendments.21. In conclusion, the committee desire to draw attention to the fact that the protocol embodying the first amendment has already been signed by the representative
-of South Africa at the second assembly. The many difficulties surrounding the application and enforcement of the economic weapon will be sensibly increased if different parts of the Empire are bound by divergent stipulations on the subject, and they, therefore, recommend that all the Dominion Governments and India should be consulted and invited to co-operate in whatever policy may ultimately be decided on in -connection with the modification of article In.We are, Sir,Your obedient servants,0.
