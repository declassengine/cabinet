[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.jPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1922.SECRET.C.P.-3747. t  cabinet.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 13th instant.General State of the Country.Police Reports of the Week.The Police reports from all parts of Southern Ireland bear witness to a marked increase in the amount of lawlessness. The number of serious outrages reported is the highest for any week since the beginning of the Truce, and there is every indication that conditions, especially in the South-West, will tend to deteriorate rather than to improve in the near future. I am not disposed, however, to take a too gloomy view of the situation. The present anarchical tendencies are due, in the main, to two transient causes, which they are not likely to survive for any length of time, viz., the suspension of the Police services in many wide districts owing to the evacuation of the Crown Forces before their replacement by a Force controlled by the new Government of the country, and the unfortunate dissensions&apos; in the ranks of the I.R.A., which have not only contributed directly to the total sum of lawlessness, but have rendered the creation of a new Regular Police Force a practical impossibility until the Free State has been place upon an unassailable constitutional foundation. When the authority of Mr. Collins and his colleagues has received the confirmation of a decisive majority of the people at the forthcoming General Election, the dual system of a &quot; Republican &quot; and a Free State Government, both administered by the same persons, will disappear, and I see no reason to doubt that it will then be possible for stern and drastic measures to be taken to restore security of life and property and to maintain the public peace.Apart from the incidents on the Northern border, which I shall reserve for treatment under a separate heading, the three worst outrages of the week were the murder of a Unionist blacksmith at Butlersbridge, Co. Cavah, in the course of an arms raid on his house on the 9th instant, the murder of a Military Officer (Lieutenant Wogan Browne, R.A.F.) on the 10th instant, and the murder of a District Inspector of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who was shot dead while on leave at Clonakilty about midnight of the 11th instant.The circumstances and motive of the last-mentioned crime have not yet been fully investigated, but the murder of Lieutenant Wogan Browne was entirely non-political. He was attacked by three armed men and shot dead while returning to barracks, the motive of his murderers being to obtain possession of a large sum of money ( 135) which he was known by them to be carrying. I am glad to state this abominable crime has aroused feelings of strong indignation in all sections of the people, and that the local I.R.A. are co-operating energetically with the Crown Forces in the search for the murderers. Three persons have already been arrested on suspicion.Breaches of the Truce in the form of attacks upon the Crown Forces have again been frequent, especially in the South-Western counties, where the extremist element in the I.R.A. is known to be strongest. The most obvious inference to be drawn from these attacks is that they were committed with the object of discrediting the Provisional Government and embarrassing its relations with the British Cabinet. [7889] &apos; b
No other motive could explain the forcible seizure of the R.I.C. barrack at Castleisland, Co. Kerry, which, within a few days of being handed over to the Provisional Government, was suddenly attacked on the 11th instant by a large body of armed men, who succeeded in overpowering the garrison and in taking possession of the barrack with it full equipment of munitions and other stores. Among the other breaches committed during the week were the ambush of a party of Police under a District Inspector near Millstreet, Co. Cork, on the 7th instant, resulting in no casualties on either side, but in the seizure of the Police motor tender; the firing at two Policemen in Ballina, Co. Mayo, on the 8th instant, and the seizure of a District Inspector^ car in South Tipperary on the same date; the kidnapping and subsequent brutal ill-treatment of a Constable at Inchigeela, Co. Cork, on the 9th instant; the ambush and seizure of a Police lorry at Lissards, Co. Cork, and the disarming of two Military Despatch Riders at Ballincollig, Co. Cork, both on the 11th instant.Other outrages reported in Southern Ireland during the week included the theft of three Police motor cars and two Police bicycles, three raids on mails, five cases of robbery with violence, the wanton destruction of machinery at Castlecomer Collieries, Co. Kilkenny, four cases of arson of houses and ci&apos;troops, two cases of firing into dwelling houses, and the kidnapping of the leading Unionist residents in Counties Donegal and Sligo. The motive of the last-mentioned outrages was to take hostages for three I.R.A. prisoners then lying under sentence of death in Derry Prison, and the kidnapped persons were released immediately on receipt of the news that the condemned men had been reprieved.Border Disturbances.The facts of the disturbances on the Northern border have already been fully published in Parliament and the Press, and need not here be recapitulated in more than a brief outline. On the morning of the 8th instant, a number of simultaneous raids were made into the counties of Tyrone, Fermanagh and Armagh by parties of I.R.A. operating from the adjoining Southern counties, and a number of Special Constables and leading Unionist civilians were kidnapped from their homes and taken to an unknown destination. On the same night two lorries of Special Constables were ambushed, separately, in the Newtownbutler area, Co. Fermanagh, by a body of I.R.A. from Clones, Co. Monaghan, and after brief engagements, in which seven Special Constables were wounded, two seriously, the occupants of the lorries were taken away as prisoners. Including these prisoners, the total number of persons captured by the raiders was forty-three. The Unionists on the frontier were taken completely by surprise, and except in one or two instance the raiders met with no attempts at resistance. In one case, however, a party of raiders numbering fifteen, while entering Enniskillen, encountered a strong force of Police and were compelled to surrender with their two motor cars and a large quantity of arms and ammunition. On the following day an ambulance party of five Special Constables and four soldiers proceeding from Armagh to Enniskillen were held up at Monaghan and made prisoners by the I.R.A., but the Military were eventually allowed to proceed with the ambulance and the Special Constables were escorted into Co. Armagh and there released.The raids of the 8th instant appear to have been carried out by local units of the I.R.A acting without the authority or prior knowledge of the Dublin Head-quarters of the organisation, and to have had for their main purpose the taking of hostages for the three Derry prisoners above mentioned, but an additional motive is stated to be the strong resentment felt at continued detention by the Northern Government of a party of Officers of the Monaghan I.R.A. Brigade, who were arrested by the Special Constabulary in Co. Tyrone on the 14th ultimo while journeying by road to Derry, ostensibly for the purpose of taking part in a football match, but having in their possession a number of documents which gave rise to the suspicion that their real object was to organise an attack upon the Derry Prison. The prompt action of the Provisional Government in dissociating themselves from these I.R.A activities and in promising that vigorous action would be taken to effect the early release of the kidnapped persons undoubtedly saved a very awkward situation, which at one time seemed not unlikely to develop on lines which might have ended in the complete frustration of all hopes of Irish peace. I am glad to state that their efforts have already resulted in the release of twenty-six of the prisoners. The facts of the unfortunate incident at Clones Station on the evening of the 11th instant, in which four Special Constables and one I.R.A. Officer were
killed and eleven Special Constables were wounded, are the subject of conflicting testimony and have not yet been sufficiently investigated to enable an impartial judgment to be given. According to &quot;the Northern Governments official communique, &quot; nothing of an unusual kind had occurred until machine gun and rifle fire was opened on the Special Constables,&quot; but the I.R.A. version, which is supported by the independent testimony of several Press correspondents, alleges that the Police themselves opened fire, killing the leader of the I.R.A., before fire was returned. It is possible that the tragedy was the result of a genuine misunderstanding on both sides, and that its real origin is to be found in the unfortunate error of judgment of the person responsible for sending a body of armed Special Constabulary into Southern Ireland at a time when their presence was almost certain to arouse the suspicion that a reprisal was being attempted for the recent raids into the Northern territory. In addition to their deplorable political consequences, these incidents have had their inevitable sequel in a further outbreak of party rioting in Belfast, in which twenty-four persons, including six children, have already lost their lives and more than seventy persons have been wounded.State of the Police Forces.

Credit for this achievement is mainly due to the&apos; Ministers of Labour for the Provisional and Northern Governments, who arranged the negotiations and have worked in complete harmony on a common policy for the whole country. The most important provisions of the agreement are the retention of an eight-hours day with a guaranteed, week of forty-eight hours and an increase of 4s. a week on existing rates of pay to the grades to whom the reduction of the 1st January last applied, subject to a reduction of 2s. as from the 15th May, 1922. Some difficulty was experienced in inducing the Railwaymen on the Cork lines to accept this settlement, and an attempt was made by the strikers on the.   [7889] B 2AO
10th instant to carry out their threat of seizing the railways and running them for the benefit of the employees. The attempt was easily frustrated by the prompt action of the I.R.A., who placed guards outside the stations and after an inconclusive ballot the strikers finally agreed by a majority of 87 to accept the terms of the agreement, with reservations as to the reduction of 2s. proposed to be made in May. It is expected that a full service on the Cork lines will be resumed in the course of the week. A further agreement of far-reaching importance has been made by the Provisional and Northern Governments to hold a joint enquiry into the position of the Railway Companies of Southern and Northern Ireland^ and it is announced that preliminary arrangements will shortly be made by the Ministers of Labour, who will meet in Belfast for the purpose.Present Political Situation in Ireland.The events of the past week have thrown a searching light upon the weakness of the Provisional Governments constitutional position until its foundations can be established on the basis of an unquestioned majority of the electorate of Southern Ireland. Its present position is aptly described in the following extract from a leading article which appeared in the &quot;Irish Times &quot; of the 13th instant:  &quot; The whole situation is preposterous. The existence of the Provisional Government is an administrative necessity; but, at a time when it is confronted with the gravest problems, it has no roots in the soil, no authority from the people, no material forces for the execution of its decrees. The battalions of drilled men who attended and policed Mr. de Valera&apos;s meeting in Dublin yesterday are not servants of the Provisional Government: they are servants of a &apos; Republic &apos; which still has a nominal existence. The President of that &apos; Republic &apos; is the chief author of the Peace Treaty and may become the first Prime Minister of the Free State. Yet Mr. Griffifth is pledged to make no use of Republican Forces which might seem to conflict with the interests of the nominal &apos; Republic&apos; Naturally, Mr. Griffifth and Mr. Collins want to escape from this net at the first possible moment; and, naturally, the extremists want to keep them there until it strangles them.&quot;The above extract by no means exhausts the anomalies of the situation. The members of the Provisional Government are for the most part also Ministers of the &quot;Irish Republic,&quot; an arrangement which enables them to employ the organisation of the I.R.A. for the broad national purposes, such as the maintenance of law and order, which cannot be misrepresented as &quot; an attempt to subvert the Republic,&quot; but at the same time disables them from making full and effective use of the trained Police Forces and of the other machinery of the old civil Administration over which they have nominally assumed control.It would hardly be a matter for surprise that a Government so circumstanced should find its popularity and prestige diminishing rapidly under hostile criticism, but there is no evidence that the political position of Mr. Collins and his colleagues has yet been appreciably impaired. Certainly the success of Mr. de Valera&apos;s Dublin demonstration of Sunday was not such as to give serious cause for alarm, and the opposition of the Republican Party to the holding of a General Election before the Constitution of the Free State has been settled in fullest detail does not suggest that they are too sanguine as to their prospects at the present moment. The Press both in Dublin and the Provinces continues to give an almost unanimous support to the Provisional Government and to the Treaty, the only notable exception being Mr. de Valera&apos;s new organ the &quot; Republic of Ireland,&quot; which I am informed has not yet attained an extensive circulation. Naturally enough, the unfortunate breach in the negotiations between Sir James Craig and Mr. Collins on the subject of the Boundary Commission is viewed with a considerable amount of disappointment by the people of Southern Ireland, but there appears to be disposition on the part of the public to charge the Provisional Government with responsibility for the breach, and the general opinion is that the matter is capable of amicable settlement to the satisfaction of both sides.H.
