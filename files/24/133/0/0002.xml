(this Document is the property op his bkitaknio majesty&apos;s government).-SECRET /i, p. 5702SCHEME OP WORK FOR THE CONFERENCE AT GENOA.Interim Report of interdepartmental Committee.The Committee containing representatives of the Treasury Foreign Office and the Board of Trade instructed to prepare material for the forthcoming international Conference at Genoa have prepared the rough draft of a scheme of work for the Conference,   This draft has boon submitted to the Chancellor of the Exchequer the president of the Board of Trade and Sir Philip Lloyd-Greame, and certain modifications have been introduced into it in accordanoo with thoir suggestions.   The scheme will need to be carefully worked over and amplified and amended before it is ready for sub-miBsion finally.   -2.    The scheme suggests that the Conference upon the opening of   its proceedings should, after passing a resolution confirming the Cannes resolution of January 6th, immediately appoint committees to deal with the following matters, which are understood to be the objocts of the Conference:(a) A general undertaking to refrain from aggression.(b) The formulation with the Russian representativesof agreed bases for a treaty with Russia,(c) Financial, economic and transport measures foreoonomic reconstruction in Europe.The proposals agreed upon by the committees would be reported to the Conference for approval and might then be incorporated in a convention or conventions to bo signed on behalf of the States represented.Where further action of an international character is provided for, It is suggested that this should be taken so far aB possible through the machinery of the League of Nations.A first draft of clauses to bo proposed as bases for a treaty with Russia is In course of preparation.A first draft is submitted of proposals to be laid before the financial, eoonomic and transport committees. These proposals aim ati) the restoration In every country of an effective gold standard for the ourrency, the eventual conclusion of a European monetary agreement undor which the various currencies would be rendered convertible with the aid of reserves of gold in a few centres, and the provision of machinery for co-operation between the central banks of issue,(ii) tne abolition of artificial regulation of the exchange.
(iii) the approval of the scheme of the InternationalCorporation, the provision of facilities for its operations and the mobilisation of assets in borrowing countries to serve as security for advances..(iv) agreement upon procodure in regard to import and export restrictions which will minimise the uncertainty caused.by the present practice.(v) the acceptance and extension of recent inter-national agreements for the improvement of transport and communications.A rough draft is also submitted of the financial, economic and transport clauses of the final convention, aB an indication how thiB instrument might be drawn.3.    The note just rocoived from the French Government may possibly render some modification desirable in the procedure suggested above.    The Committee have ventured to set out in the memorandum annexed certain considerations in regard to this note.February 8th, 1922.(Signed)    S.J. CHAPMAN.
JEMORANDUM OM THE FRENCH NOTE OF FEBRUARY 5TH.The French Note states:(1). That the Supreme Council decided that the Soviet ,Government is to be taken as having accepted the conditions laid down In the supreme Council1s&quot;Resolution of January 6th, and that if it or any othor Government should give it to bo understood in its roply to the invitation to Genoa or by official declarations that it did not accept those con&apos;ii:or3 completely and in advance, the French Government could not attend the Gonoa Conference.It is not quite correct to say that the Council made this decision, it is understood that they merely decided that the terms of the invitation made it abundantly&apos;cloar to the Russian^ that the Conference was called on the basis of the January 6th stipulations.   This perhaps had better be indicated in the roply.(2). That since the Governments accepting the invitation toGonoa are to be regarded aB having accepted the conditions the Conference must not be permitted to approve or discuss the Resolution of January 6th, but simply the method of oarrying into effect the principles therein laid down.(3). That a complete understanding must be reached betweenthe Allied Governments before the Conference opens as to the interpretation of these principles^ which the Note proceeds to discuss in detail,(4). That next a complete understanding must be reached between the French Government and the British and other Allied Governments as to the interpretation to be given to the re3t of the programme for the Conference and especially as to what matters must not be permitted to be ^brought f forward there.      In particular none of the provisions of tho Treaties of Peace must be discussed,(5). That so vast and difficult is the programme that theConference should bo postponed until at any rato the beginning of May.It appears that the French Government is anxious toseoure the postponement and it may be that they would liketo see and are hoping for the eventxial abandonment of tho Genoa Conference.It is assumed that His Majesty^ Government on the other hand are desirous that the Conference should be hold and with as little delay as possible.-.     It would then appear desirable in replying to the French Note to make this clear and also that wo consider that the necessary preparations can be completed in time for the Conference to open on the date fixed at Cannes.But as the French may nevertheless insist   on post-ponement an early deoision may be needed as to whether wo should be preparod to go on with the conference at an early date in the absence of the French (and the Americans).As regards Russia, the French may be reassured by our pointing out that in their reply to the definite invitation to attend at Genoa the Russians (as Is understood to be the case) gave no indication of dissent from the Cannes -conditions, and that we are aware of no ground&apos;for supposing that they intend to do so.    (it will be observed that the French Note does not insist on the Russians specifiolally assontlng at this stage).-
The French also raiso questions concerning the exact interpretation of certain pronouncements in the resolution of January 6th and insist on the importance of our agreeing upon their   exact moaning,    In roply wo might point out that what really matters is the satisfactory application of these resolutions in any agreement with Russia, and say that we are prepared to submit the general outline of proposals to them, to show the particular application that we have in mind, and consider any proposals thoy may have to make it being under-stood that all that need bo examinod at this stage- is the general nature of a basis for a treaty.If this oourae is adopted, and to avoid a detailed ex-amination of the resolution of January 6th in plenary con-ferenoo (which the French object to) it might be advisable to start the conference with the appointment of the Russian Treaty Committee making it clear in the resolution appoint-ing the Committee that effect is to be given in the Treaty to the declaration of January 6th.   Any discussion of detailed points arising out of the Cannes conditions would then take place in the first instance at any rate in Committee.If French co-operation is desired, thero will no doubt have to be some frank discussion with them before tho Conference moots.     This,it as suggested, should not take the form of a theoretic discussion (which is apt to be fruit-loss) of the interpretation either of tho Cannes Resolution or of the preliminary agenda drafted there, but should aim at an interchange of  &apos;ideas as to the nature of the proposals to be brought forward at Genoa both with regard to the Russian Treaty and otherwise.    It would bo possible to make to the Frenoh Govornment some provisional communications at once to this end.Decision is also necessary as to what, if any, assurances can be given to tho Fronch regarding tho exclusion of dis-cussion about the revision of the Peaco treaties and arrange-ments made in tho matter of reparation.If the course outlined above should bo decided upon, the reply to tho Frenoh note might ooncludo with an invitation to the Fronch Government to send reprosontatives to London without delay to discuss with British and Italian representative the goneral form of the bases for a Treaty with Russia and the other proposals to be brought forward at 0\

General objects to be aimed at.1, The affirmation by the Conference of the CannesResolution.2. The negotiation with tho Russian Representatives of-agreed bases.for a Treaty of Peace between the Powers and Russia   ensuring peace, the abandonment of propaganda, and recognition of tho principles relating to property embodied in the Resolution of January 6th, together with the setting up of somo machinery to determine the payments to be made and the means of payment.5.

The conclusion of a convention or conventionsfor the restoration of Europe (to include the pact referred to in (3) above) by which the signatory countries would pledge themselves to give effect to such part of tho Conference&apos;s recommendations as could be embodied in this form.The above suggestions represent the objects for which Great. Britain (or preferably, If previous agreemotrt oan be reached, the main Powers concerned) should aim. -After passing a Resolution under (l) the Conference should appoint committees to consider the matters under (2),  (3) and (4).    The results of the work of tho committees under (3) and (4) should, after approval by tho Conference, be Incorporated in the convention suggested under (5); for. this purpose a drafting Committee will be required.
Ministers will no doubt 3erve as the prlnoipal delegates on Committees, and this will probably render it inoonveniont for the Conference to remain in continuous session,, Plenary sessions might be held, however, two or three timo3 a weehj to receive reports from Committees and deal with other business that may arise.Annexed are suggested resolutions for submission to the conference and suggested resolutions in regard to financial economic and transport questions to bo submitted to the Committees to be sot up to deal with these questions. A rough draft of the financial, economic and transport clauses of a European Convention is also annexed as an indication of the lines upon which such an instrument might bo drawn.   A first draft of clauses to be proposed as bases for a Treaty with Russia is in courso of preparation.
RESOLUTIONS TO EE SUBMITTED TO THE CONFERENCE,.The Powers here in conference accept the conditions laid down for the Conference &quot;by tho Resolution passed by the Council of Principal Allied Powers at Cannes on January 6th,  1922, and affirm as follows:-/JNote.- The following is taken from the Cannes Resolution^7The resumption of international trade throughout Europe and the development of tho resources of all countries are necessary to Increase the volume of productive employment and to relievo the widespread suffering of the European peoples.   A united effort by the stronger Powers is necessary to oliminate: the paralysis of the European system. This effort must include the removal, of all obstacles in the way of trade, the provision of substantial credits for the weaker countries, and the co-operation of all nations in the restoration of normal prosperity,    The fundamental conditions upon which this effort may be made with hope of success may be broadly stated as follows:-1.    Nations can claim, no right to dictate to each other regarding the principles on which, they are to regulate their system, of ownership, internal economy, and government.    It Ib for every nation to choose, for itself the system which it prefers in this respect.2. Before, however, foreign capital can be made available to assist; the country foreign investors, must be assured that their property and their rights will, be respected, and the fruits of their enterprise secured to them.o. Effective security cannot be re-established unless the Governments of countries desiring foreign credit freoly indicate - (a) that they will, recognise all public debts and obligations which have been or may be undertaken or guaranteed by the State or Municipalitiet- or by any other public bodies as well as tho obligation to restore or compensate all foreign interests for loss or damage caused to them when property has been confiscated or withheld;  (b) that they will establish a legal and juridical system ?;hich sanctions and enforces commercial and other contracts with impartiality.4,   An adequate moans of exchange must be available, and generally there must be financial and curroncy conditions which offer, sufficient security for trade,5. All nations should undertake to refrain from.&apos; propaganda from motives subversive to order and tho established political system in other /countries than their own..6. All countries should join in an undertaking to refrain from aggression against their neighbours.3o
Pursuant to paragraph 6 of the Cannes Resolution thero shall &quot;be prepared for the approval of the Conference an undertaking to be signod on behalf of the States here represented to refrain from aggrossion against their neighbours.    The conference entrusts tho drafting of this undertaking to a Committee consisting of considering that it is neoossary for tho general security and economic rehabilitation of Europe that the relations between Russia and the other States hero represented should be sottlod upon a permanont basis, the Conference appoints the following Committee to prepare agreed bases for a Treaty embodying such a settlement:-The States here assembled, recognising.that essential conditions for the re-establishment of confidence and the reconstruction of the economic life of Central and Eastern Europe aro (a) stability of values including international exchanges,  (b) a minimum of regulation in restraint of trade, and (c) tho restoration of facilities of communication and transport; desire that reports shall bo submitted without delay to thoir consideration indicating the practical steps that can be taken to achieve those conditions, and accordingly appoint the following Committees to prepare proposals under tho heads indicated above:-(a) Committee on Financial Conditions, consisting of(b) Committoe on Economic Conditions, consisting of(c) Committee on Transport Conditions consisting of
IllPACT    OP   PEACE. &quot;It Is presumed that the Conference of Ministers will give the necessary instructions as to drafting provisions dealing with this questiono7*
BASES FOR A TREATY OF PEACE: WITH RUSSIA. ^A first draft of clauses to be proposed as bases for a treaty with Russia is in course of pre para tion^T&quot;
ii draft RESOLUTIONS TO BE SUBMITTED TO FINANCIAL COMMITTEE.1,      CURRENCY.(1) An essential requisite for the eoonomic reconstruction of Europe is the achievement by each country of &quot;stability in the value of Its currency. No country can gain control of its own currency so long as there is a deficiency in the annual budget which is met by the creation of paper money or bank credits.     It is for every country to overcome such a deficiency by its own Independent efforts, and only then will Its way be open to currency reform.(2) Measures of currency reform will be facilitated if the practice of continuous co-operation among central banks can be developed.     A permanent association of central banks, not necessarily confined to Europe, would provide opportunities of co-ordinating credit policy, without hampering the freedom of the several banks.(3) It is desirable that all European currencies should be based upon a common standard.(4) Gold is the only common standard which all European countries could at present agree to adopt.(5) In a number of countries it will not be possible for some years to restore an effective gold standardj but it is In the general interest that European Governments should declare now that this is their ultimate object, and should agree on the programme by way of which they intend to achieve itc(6) In each country the first step towards re-establish-ing a gold standard will be the balanoing of the. annual expenditure of the State without the creation of fresh credit unrepresented by new assets.(7) The next step will be to determine and fix the gold valf^e of the monetary unit.     Each country must decide, according to Its own circumstances, whether to adopt the old.gold parity or a new parity approximating to the exchange value of the monetary unit at the time.(8) These steps might by themselves suffice to establish a gold standard, but its successful maintenance would be materially promoted, not only by the proposed association of central banks, but by an international agreement.     This agreement, whioh might be based upon the system known as a gold exchange standard, should be framed with a view to centralising the demand for gold as currency, and avoiding those wide fluctuations in the&apos; purchasing power of gold which might otherwise result from simultaneous and competitive efforts of a number of countries to secure metallic reserves *
2.  CREDITS.Tho Conferenoe, while it is confident that private credit will again bocome availablo as soon as currencies are stabilised and confidence is restored, recognises the necessity under existing conditions of special machinery for facilitating the immediate co-operation of tho economically stronger countries for recon-struction purposes.The States here represented are therefore agreed(a) to approve the scheme of the International Corporation now before them.(b) to support the Corporation and facilitate its operations.(c) that it is essential for countries in need of credits to take steps at once to make their assets available to serve as security for the assistance they require, whether, through the International Corporation or other channels, and immediately to enter into con-sultation with the Corporation or other agencies for tho purpose of securing such co-operation.
5. EXCHANGES.The Conference recognises that one of the chief obstaoles in the way of the restoration of trade is. the collapsed condition and instability of many of the European exchanges, and that this is due to the continual depreciation of ourrency, the failure of production for export and the lack of trade facili-ties.   . It affirms its conviction that attempts to limit fluctuations in exchange by imposing artificial control on exchange operations are futile and mis-chievous;    that the only sure remedy is to remove the causes of Instability.     In the meantime the carrying out of the recommendation of the Conference relating to credits would afford Borne relief.:The Conference therefore recommends(1)    that all regulations attempting to limit fluctuations in exchange by means of artificial control of exchange operations should be abolished at the earliest possible date.(2)    that the States here represented should under-take to remove within twelve months after substantial progress has been made in the restoration of a country&apos;s exchanges any special restrictions imposed on imports from that country on the ground of depreciated exchange.
DRAFT RESOLUTIONS TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE ECONOMIC COMMITTEE.Facilities and guarantees for the Import and export of Commercial products. (CUSTOMS TARIFFS AND RESTRICTIONS).The Conference welcomes the decision reached at Portorose by the States there assembled with regard to import and export restrictions and invites those States to take early steps to give effect thereto.Inasmuch as the development of normal trade with all countries is only possible where traders are in a position to ascertain some time in advance the conditions under which goods can legally be imported into and exported from each country, it is resolved that any Customs restrictions and Customs duties incident to importation and exportation should be regulated by the following principles-(i) All Customs Tariffs and Schedules of import restrictions should be made so far as possible applloable over substantial periods of time and changes both in rates of duty and in regulations with regard to restrictions should be made as rarely as possible, the practice of frequent modification to meet special circumstances being entirely abandoned.(ii) Every country has the -right subject to special agreements to prohibit absolutely the importation of goods of certain descriptions in the interests of national health, political security, national morals, or for other special purposes, or to allow the Importation of specified commodities only if consigned to recognised organisations either for the purpose of giving effect to a State monopoly or for seeing that the whole importation is put to a specified use, but prohibitions framed for any such.purpose should be publicly announced and as limited in extent as possible.(iii) Where for any reason it is desired to limit the amount of any article to be imported through ordinary trade channels such limitation should preferably be effected by the medium of Customs duties rather than by a system of prohibitions modified by licences, and every country should at once examine the possibility of abandoning or reducing to the smallest possible dimensions the number of goods to which the latter system is applied, so that the general pre-war position in this regard may be attained so soon as possible save in so far as it has been modified by general International Conventions concluded since the outbreak of the war.(iv) where nevertheless a system of prohibition accompanied by licences cannot wholly be dispensed with, licences should be granted on conditions which are publicly announced, unambiguously stated, and uniformly applicable
and these conditions should have no regard to the country of origin of the goods.   Any trader should accordingly be in a position easily to estimate in advance whether and under what conditions a licence is procurable.   Administration should be on the simplest lines possible and every arrangement should be made to secure that applications for licences are dealt with expeditiously by competent bodies organised for the purpose.(v) Similar provisions mutatis mutandis to those laiddown In ill and iv should be applied&apos; In regard to any restriction of exportation which any country may find neoessary for the purpose of conserving its eoonomio resouroes.With a view to securing the Immediate application of these principles it is desirable that the Provisional Economic and Financial Committee of the League of Nations should be given power to enquire into the progress made by the various States in carrying them into operation, and to investigate complaints, to consult with the Governments concerned and to publish reports from time to time0All the countries here assembled should keep this Committee regularly informed of all changes in Customs Tariffs or in the regulations relating to prohibition or restriction of imports or exports, and the Committee should be authorised to make recommendations to the countries ooncerned as regards any changes which may be proposed.&quot;Legal guarantees for the re-establishment of commerce&quot;.(To be drafted),&apos;
ADMISSION OP FOREIGNERS IN THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.Foreign firms or individuals carrying on any permitted trade, profession or occupation should be, subject only to the same taxation as is borne by nationals.The taxation of foreign companies should be based on similar principles and the system of taxation so framed and administered that branches of foreign companies carrying on permitted trades professions and occupations in the territory of any country should not bear a greater burden of taxation in that country than do the businesses carried on in the country by native companies. -/&quot;Note :   It has been suggested that the British delegates should resist at the Conference any proposals relating to the admission of foreigners in the conduct of business which would conflict with the provisions of existing legislation in this country, e.g. the Non-Ferrous Metal Industry Act, 1918, the Trading with the Enemy Amendment Act, 1918 (Section 2, relating to banks controlled by ex-enemy subjects), and the Aliens Restriction Amendment Act, 1919It is desirable that, in the matter of passport visa regulations, all countries should at once adopt and put into practice in their entirety the recommendations of the International Conference on Passports, Customs Formalities and Through Tickets held at Paris in October, 1920, under the auspices of the Provisional Committee on Communications and Transit of the League of Nations./&quot;&quot;Note :    This proposal has received the concurrence of the Home Office.The more important of the Paris resolutions may be summarised as follows:-(a) The abolition of the visa for exit.(b) All entrance visas to be valid for one yearunless limited, to a shorter period for special reasons.     The validity of a transit visa to be the same as the period of validity of the visa of the country of destination.(o)    The maximum fees charged for visas to be -Entrance visa ........... 10 francs (gold).Transit visa ...........    1 franc    (gold).(d)    The transit visa, unless for exceptionalreasons (e.g. undesirables), to be issued at once without enquiry solely upon production of the entrance visa for the country of destination in addition to transit visas for the intermediate countries. /
PROTECTION OF INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY AND COPYRIGHTS.It is desirable that all States that have not already done so should at once take steps to adhere to the International Convention of Paris of March 20th, 1883, as revised at Washington In 1911, for the protection of industrial property and to the International Convention of Berne of September 9th, 1886, revised at Berlin on November 13th, 1908, and completed by the Additional Protocol signed at Berne on March 20th, 1914, for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Work.Pending such&apos; adhesion every State should, in so far as Industrial, Literary and Artistic property is not now reciprocally protected as between itself and any other of the Signatory States, give effective protection to such property on condition of reciprocity;    and should further -save in so far as such rights have been or shall be dealt with by the Treaties of Peace with Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, - recognise, restore, and protect all rights in such property belonging to the nationals of other States which might now have been in foroe in its territory, except for any exceptional legislative or administrative aotion taken in consequence of war or revolution   between August 1st, 1914, and the present date.
RESOLUTIONS TO BE SUBMITTED TO TRANSPORT COMMITTEE.1.     The Conference, recognising that efficient transport is the first requisite for the revival of production and trade, calls on the States to devote their unremitting efforts to the restoration and improvement of the structure, equipment and organisation of their railways, harbours and other means of communication, and recommends that where the present resources of any State appear to be inadequate to the task, steps should be taken without delay to secure assistance whether from the International Corporation or other suitable source.2,     The Conference approves the Agreement for the Regulation of International Railway Traffic signed at Portorose on the 23rd November, 1921, and recommends that the principles of that Agreement should immediately be applied to all the European States represented at Genoa. It requests the Councir of the League of Nations to authorise the Advisory and Technical Committee for Communications and Transit.of the League, acting if necessary through specially appointed committees of experts.(a) to enquire into the measures already taken to carry the Portorose Agreement into effect;(b) to suggest, in consultation with the Governments concerned, any modifications in detail necessary to apply its principles to the circumstances of States not represented at Portorose, and(c) to make such recommendations as may seem fit to secure the immediate and effective carrying out of the objects of the Agreement in regard to all the States concerned.3.     The Conference welcomes the Conventions concluded at Barcelona on the 20th April, 1921, regarding Freedom of Transit and the Regime of Navigable Waterways of Inter-national Concern, together with the additional Protocol to the latter Convention, and the Recommendations relative to the International Regime of Railways;    it calls the atten-tion of the Council of the League of Nations to the neces-sity of convening at the earliest possible date the proposed Conference for the preparation and conclusion of a Convention on Railways and of expediting the preliminary enquiries of the Advisory and Technical Committee of the League.
PRELIMINARY   DRAFT   OF CONVENTION FOR THE RESTORATIONOF EUROPE.The Governments here represented, having regard to the neoessity of giving immediate effect to the resolutions adopted by the Conference hereby agree as follows:-1. The Governments signatory to this Convention undertaketo co-operate in the establishment and working of the Central International Corporation and the National Corporations affiliated therewith, the constitution of which is scheduled to this Convention.2, Those States which desire assistance will take stepsat once to make their assets available to serve as security for the &quot;assistance required through the Corporation or other - agencies.3. The Signatory States agree to adopt gold as their even-tual monetary standard, and, with this end in view, to  set on foot an international gold standard monetary convention, the essential features of which are stated in the annex to this Convention.4. They further agree to do all in their power to promote the practice of continuous co-operation among central banks, if possible through a permanent association, with a view to co-ordinating credit policy, without hampering the freedom of the several banks.5. The Signatory States are agreed that within twelvemonths after the depreciation of a country1s currency in relation to gold has ceased and substantial progress has been made with the rectification of exchanges, they will abandon any policy of special protection against imports from that country on the ground of its abnormally depreciated exchange.6. Those States whose representatives were signatories ofthe agreement relating to customs regulations and restrictions signed at Portorose in November, 1921, undertake, so far as they have not already done so, to adopt the recommendations of that agreement and to take steps without delay for giving effect to them.7. Inasmuch as the development of normal trade is only possible where traders are in a position to ascertain some time in advance the conditions under which     goods can legally be imported into and exported from each country it is agreed that any Customs restrictions and Customs duties incident to importation and exportation shall be regulated by the follow-ing provisions(i)     All Customs Tariffs and Schedules of Import Restric-tions shall be made so far as possible applicable over sub-stantial periods of time and changes both in rates of duty and in regulations with regard to restrictions shall be made as rarely as possible, the practice of frequent modification to meet special circumstances being entirely abandoned.
(ii)     While every country has the right, subject to special agreements, to prohibit absolutely the importation of goods of certain descriptions in the interests of national health, political security,, national, morals, or for other special purposes., or to allow the importation of specified commodities only if consigned to recognised organisations either for the purpose of giving effect to a State monopoly or for securing that the whole importa-tion is put to a specified use, any prohibitions framed for any such purpose shall be publicly announced and as limited in extent as possible.(iii)     Where for any reason it is desired to limit the amount of any article to bo imported through ordinary trade channels such limitation shall so far as possible be effect-ed by the medium of Customs duties rather than by a system of prohibitions modified by licences, and every country shall at once examine the possibility of abandoning or re-ducing to the smallest possible dimensions the number of goods to which the latter system is applied, so that the general pre-war position in this regard may be attained so soon as possible, save- in so far as it has been modified by general International Conventions concluded since the outbreak of the war.(iv)     Where nevertheless a system of prohibition, accompanied by licences cannot wholly be dispensed with, licences shall be granted on conditions which are publicly announced, unambiguously stated and uniformly applicable, and these conditions shall have no relation to the country of origin of the goods.     Any trader shall accordingly be placed in a position easily to estimate in advance whether and under what conditions a licence is procurable.     Admin-istration shall be on the simplest lines possible and every arrangement shall be made to secure that applications for licences are dealt with expeditiously by competent bodies organised for the purpose.(v)     Similar provisions mutatis mutandis to those laid down above shall be applied in regard to any restriction of exportation which any country may find necessary for the purpose of conserving its economic resources.(vi)     The States signatory to this Convention will give all information and assistance to an appropriate inter-national expert Committee to enable that body to enquire into the progress made by the various states in carrying the above provisions into operation, and to investigate complaints.     A request shall be addressed to tho League of Nations on behalf of the signatory States that the Provisional Economic and Financial Committee of the League of Nations may be authorised to act as this Committee.(vii)     This Committee shall be kept regularly informed of all changes in Customs Tariffs or in the regulations re-lating to the prohibition or restriction of imports or ex-ports, and shall be authorised to make recommendations to the States concerned as regards any changes that may be .proposed,      it shall publish reports of its work from time to time.
*   Accession by   States not members of the League of Nations can only be made if the Council decide officially to communicate the Instruments to them.     It must be as-certained whether the Council has so decided, and if neces-sary the Conference should move it to do so.r8. Foreign firms or individuals oarrying on any per-.mlttod trade, profession or occupation within the territory of any of the States signatory of the present Convention shall he subject only to the same taxation as is borne by nationals.The taxation of foreign companies shall be based on similar principles and the system of taxation so framed and administered that branches of foreign companies carry-ing on permitted trades, professions and occupations in the territory of any country shall not bear a greater burden of taxation in that country than do the businesses carried-on in the country by native companies. - &quot;9. Those States which have not yet done so undertakewithin six months from the coming into force of the present Convention to adopt and put into practice the recommenda-tions of the International Conference on Passports, Customs . j Formalities and Through Tickets held at Paris in October, 1920, under the auspices of the Provisional Committee on Communications and Transit of the League of Nations.10. So far as they have not already done so, the signatoryStates undertake to adhere to the International Convention of Paris of March 2Oth, 1883, as revised at Washington in 1911, for the protection of industrial property and to the International Convention of Berne of September 9th, 1886, revised at Berlin on November 13th, 1908, and completed by the Additional Protocol signed at Berne on March 20th, 1914, for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Work.Pending such adhesion each of the Signatory States agrees that in so far as Industrial, Literary, and Artistic property is not now reciprocally protected as between itself and any other of the Signatory States it will in all such cases give effective protection to such property on con-dition of reciprocity;    and further that, - save in so far as such rights have been or shall be dealt with by the Treaties of Peace with Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey, - it will upon the same condition recognise, restore, and protect all right in such property belonging to the nationals of other signatory States which might now have been in force in its territory, except for any exceptional legislative or administrative action taken in consequence of war or revolution between August 1st, 1914, and the date of this Convention.11.        (a)    Those States which have not already done so under-take within six months from the coming into force of the present Convention to ratify or accede to the Conventions concluded at Barcelona on the 20th April, 1921, regarding Freedom of Transit and the Regime of Navigable waterways, of International Concern, together with the Additional Protocol to the latter Convention, and to accept the Re-commendations relative to the International Regime of Railways.^
(b)     Those States parties to the Agreement signed at Portorose on the 23rd November, 1921, for the removal of impediments to international railway traffic, who have not already ratified this Agreement undertake to do so within six months from the date of the present Treaty.The parties to the Agreement undertake to afford all information and facilities to the Advisory and Technical Committee for Communications and Transit of the League of Nations in enquiring into the measures already taken to carry the Agreement into effect, and they undertake to consider any recommendations made by the Committee for facilitating the immediate and effective carrying out of the objects of the Agreement.Those States not parties to the Agreement will take steps,  so far as practicable, for the application of its principles so far as they are concerned.

ANNEX *INTERNATIONAL GOLD STANDARD MONETARY CONVENTION.(l)       The Governments of the participating oountries declare that the restoration of an effective gold standard is their ultimate object, and they agree to carry out, as rapidly as may be in their power the following programme;-(a) In order to gain effective control of its own currency, each government must moot its annual expenditure without resorting to the creation of paper money or bank credits for the purpose.(b) The next step will be to determine and fix the gold value of the monetary unit. This will not necessarily be at the former gold par.(c) The gold value so fixed must then be made effective. The proof that this has been accomplished will be the free quotation of the national currency at par in the international&apos; exchange markets.(d) The maintenance of the curroncy at its gold value must be assured by the provision of an adequate reserve of approved assets, not necessarily gold.(2)        Certain of the participating countries will be constituted gold centres and will bind themselves to maintain a free market in gold.(3)        The other members of the Convention, while they will not be precluded from retaining.gold reserves at home, will maintain at the gold centres an adequate reserve of approved assets in the form of bank credits, bills, short-term
aocur3.ties or other suitable liquid resources. (4)        The ordinary practice of a participating country will be to issue additional papor money only against equal additions to its reserves of approved assets at tho gold centres, and to offer oredits on a gold centre within a prescribed fraotion of parity in oxohango for its own papor money on demand.(5)        Tho Convention will thus bo based on a gold exchange standard.   The condition of continuing membership will be the &quot;maintenance of the national currency unit at the prescribed value,   Failuro in this respect will entail suspension of full membership.(6)        The Government - of each country will be rosponsiblo to the Convention for maintaining the international valuo of it3 currency at par, but will bo left ontiroly free to dovise and apply the means, whether through regulation of credit by control bank3 or otherwise. (7)        In the countries selected as gold centres credit will bo regulated not only with a view to maintaining the currencies at par with one another, but also with a view to preventing undue fluctuations in the purchasing power of gold.    It is not contemplated, however, that the discretion of the central banks should be fettered by any definite rules framed for this purposo.SO.
