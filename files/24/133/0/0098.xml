Efforts will doubtless be made to avert the threatened stoppages and it is possible that the General Council of the Trades Union Congress will assume the role of mediator.A f aotor in the situation is tho attempt of the revolutionaries and their press to represent the employers- attitude as an attack on trade unionism and to bring about a complete stoppage of the industries oonoarnoda   Most of the agitators who have worked at all are engineers.The parliamentary policy and electoral programme of the Communist Party are given in this report.The funds of the Communist Party are again running short.,It is probable that the forthcoming ooumuniat &quot;polios conference&quot; will be acl/leod by Its officials to ratify the &quot;Decisions of the Third Congress of the Communist international.&quot;
THE UNEMPLOYED.

A large number of reports regarding the activities of the unemployed are still being received: these emphasise the continued gravity of the unemployment situation but contain little new matter: demonstrations to Guardians have been held in London and in provincial towns and there appears to be growing opposition among the unemployed to the working of overtime. The general impression gathered from the reports received is that the cessation of the unemployed benefit or drastic reduction in out-relief might lead to disorder. There seems also little doubt that if the threatened lock-out of engineers materialise the situation will be considerably aggravated. Communist agitators are working unceasingly among the unemployed and this fact, combined with a good deal of real distress, is responsible for a general feeling of bitterness and restlessness.

Increasing attention is being paid by the unemployed to election of members of local Government bodies did it is probable that propaganda among the unemployed would have considerable effect in the event of a general election. Communist efforts to stress the alleged identity of interest between employed and unemployed workers is beginning to bear fruit in some instances.

On February 23rd a demonstrative to the Leytonstone Guardians resulted in a collision of police and unemployed, which was followed by five arrests. On February 22nd a group of the Lambeth organised unemployed seized a house in Kennington and it is reported that on February 28th about 50 unemployed ordered/

The Third International meanwhile, pursuing its aim of a united front, is endeavouring to come to an understanding with other labour bodies, on a common basis of:

International repudiation of war debts. 

Opposition to reductions in wages.

Limitation of armaments.

Introduction of an 8 hour working day in all countries.

Participation by labour in the control of industries and banks.

Full recognition of the Soviet Government.

In spite of the announcement in "The Communist" that the "Policy" conference on March 18th-19th was to be held in Devonshire Hall it has now been decided to hold it in the "St. Pancras Town Hall": the financial stipulations have been rescinded and "all branches irrespective of payment of dues will be permitted representation": proxy delegates will be allowed in cases where branches are unable to raise expenses and on delegate will be allowed to represent more than one branch. A copy of the agenda and resolutions bearing the names of McManus and Pest is in my possession: the chief items are.

Chairman&apos;s address,

Report of the Executive,

The Decisions of the Third Congress of the Communist International,

The sis on the United Front.

Reference has already been made in these reports to the Decisions or Theses of the Third International which have recently been distributed secretly to members only in book form: if the resolutions submitted by the executive on the agenda paper be adopted the party will have ratified the sections on the International Situation, Revolutionary Tactics, Tactics of the Russian Communist Party, Red International of Trade Unions and Organisation. These theses are such as to raise the question of the local status of the Communist Party. The industrial and electrical policies of the Party are also to be ratified: the former has been outlined in previous reports and the latter will be found in another part of this report.

                                                                             There/


There are indications that the Communist Party is again running short of money and the officials&apos; hopes in this connection are contred upon MacManus&apos;s visit to Russia.

It is reported that representatives of foreign co-operative societies are now in or en route to Moscow in order to investigate the possibility of making contracts between Russian and foreign co-operative societies: five English delegates who are not known to have any connection with the communist movement have gone: there seems little doubt that Kehrhahn&apos;s hurried return to Russia was connected with this matter.

Following upon negotiations between the "Hands off Russia" Committee and the Finnish Legation Neil McLean, M.P., and Robert Williams have been appointed to visit Russia "and examine the boundaries in the dispute between Finland and Russia concerning Karelia."

W.N. Ewer, foreign editor of the "Daily Herald", has returned to this country from Russia.

Ex-Colonel Malone, M.P., intends to speak for Saklatvala, at Battersea Town Hall on March 5th and has asked him what should be the subject of his speech: failing directions from Saklatvala, Malone will deal with the Geddes report and Genoa.

The "Free Oxford" is in considerable financial difficulties and the editor has announced that unless he receives Â£330 the paper cannot appear again. H.D. Dickenson, a young communist from Cambridge University, is offering his services to the Russian Trade Delegation and has been recommended to Emile Burns by Maurice Dobb.

Tom Anderson is about to start the publication of a monthly magazine entitled "Proletcult": he was formerly the editor of "Red Dawn", the organ of the proletarian school movement.

Henry Sara has been engaged by the American "Friends of

 
of Soviet Russia for a lecture tour in the States: his fare has been sent to him but he does not appear to have started as yet.



"THE PARLIAMENTARY POLICY AND ELECTORAL PROGRAMME OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY."

A printed "conference copy" of the document bearing the above title, which will be debated and probably accepted by the conference on March 18th-19th, is in the possession of this department: it contains matter which has, for the most part, been covered in previous reports: the first section is probably a milder edition of the document drawn up by W?tol Newbould, from which extracts were given in report No.140: in so far as the "electoral programme" resembles, in some respects, the platform of the Labour Party, some quotations may be of interest: 

"Communist Parliamentary Policy".

"The Communist Party end or? and accepts the principle of parliamentary action as contained in the decisions of the Communist International. The reason for participation in parliamentary activity of the Communist Party is essentially different from that of the Labour Party. The Labour Party assumes the comparative stability of the Capitalist system, and that alterations in the basis of society can only be secured by a long-drawn out series of constitutional changes, and therefore looks upon parliamentary activity as the only means of securing a new social system. The Communist Party has no such illusions. The formal side of Parliament, based upon the apparent democratic method of electing M.P&apos;s lends colour to the view that Parliament is the expression of the people&apos;s will. In practice, it is simply a buttress of landed and Capitalist interests. Apart from the many checks and safeguards which the constitution of the contains, forms of parliamentary procedure, the non-elective cabinet of ministers, the House of Lords, the permanent official bureaucracy, etc., etc., the Communist Party knows by actual experience that the Capitalist class use the formulas of democracy and constitutionalism only as a cloak to hide the reality of bourgeois dictatorship. The Capitalist class, when threatened, dispense with parliamentary democracy, and take executive action without the consultation and consent of Parliament...

working-class organisations...

"Summarised, our policy should be one that moves in the direction of securing the leadership of the proletarian masses within the Labour Party. Wherever our support to Labour candidates will influence the masses towards Communism, that support should be given; and wherever Communists appear on the platform of Labour candidates it must be made clear that the reformist policy should be exposed, and the Labour candidates influenced as far as possible in the direction of Communism. Wherever the reactionary leaders are opposed it must be made clear to the rank and file that we are not fighting them (the rank and file) but those who seek to betray them..."



Draft Electoral Policy."

"The Problem of Economic Reconstruction.

"...The workers should take control of all factories, mines, etc., and operate them themselves. The working class possesses within itself the capacity and ability to run industry. As workers we have operated the machines in the past for the profit-taking idle class. We now demand that this class and the system it supports which fails to keep the factories operating, and which is responsible for widespread unemployment and starvation, gets out of the way of social progress. We demand that all the machinery should be taken over by councils of workers, who can, and will, operate it for the common good of the working class.



2. Disarmament.

"The Communist Party is opposed to Imperialism, is opposed to all capitalist wars. It exposes the false talk of the capitalist statements who talk glibly of peace whilst preparing for war. Whilst the struggle for profits, for markets remains, there will always be the certainty of war. Proposals for disarmament are valueless unless the cause of armaments is destroyed. The C.P., therefore, stands for the only practical realisation of disarmament - the break-up of economic frontiers, the ending of the exploitation of economically backward nations, and the consequent removal of the cause of racial hatreds, and the setting up of proletarian governments controlled by the working masses united in a world-wide free federation, of Workers&apos; Republic.



3."Ireland, India, Egypt, and all Subject Peoples within the British Empire."

"The C.P. declares that the Colonial question is more than a sentimental plea for Nationalism. Colonisation is the result of the development of capitalism. Every advanced capitalist country seeks, by annexing or exercising control over the territories occupied by economically backward people, to find profitable markets for its goods or spheres of investment for its surplus capital. The British Empire, covering fourteen million square miles, and embracing one-quarter of the human race, exists in the interest of a small and unscrupulous capitalist class, which thrives on

working-class is the only useful class in society, and yet, under the present system, is denied the opportunity of intellectual developments, and its children driven into the factories and sweatshops at an immature age.

"The C.P. demands for the children of the working-class a free education up to the highest stages, with complete maintenance during the whole period. It pledges itself to fight for this demand, and to resist any and every attempt to cut down the present meagre opportunities for education. It further pledges itself to strive for alteration of the character of education at present obtaining. To remove from school curricula teachings of a servile character or instruction biassed in favour of the capitalist class, and to substitute scientific teaching that interpretates history, economics and social life, from the working-class point of view, with provision for such facilities for technical knowledge calculated to fit the working-class child to fill the important part it has to play in social life when manhood and womanhood is reached.

"The values represented on paper in shape of war loan stock, consuls, and gilt-edged securities generally, were created by the working class in the past and used by the capitalist state to further its own ends. Although used once they remain a further claim on the productive energies of the working class. The national debt stands at about Â£8,000,000,000 and the workers are compelled, without over reducing the original claim, to meet nearly Â£400,000,000 per year in the shape of interest.



"The C.P. stands for the total abolition and cancellation of all national debts. It stands for the setting up of a working-class government which shall have no responsibility to pay an idle class hundreds of millions of pounds per year.



"The capitalist political parties refuse starving and unemployed workers adequate relief pleading huge debts and lack of finance. The C.P. declares that finance can be found for the unemployed if national debts and interest thereon are cancelled.



"The capitalist parties talk of economy. The C.P. declares that all the economy proposals put forward by these parties are attempted to save the bourgeoisie its burden of taxation. The only economy proposal that the working class should support is the complete sweeping away of the idle and parasitical class that loves the productive labour of the workers. The C.P. demands that all the values produced by the working class shall accrue to that class, and to that end urges the workers to take hold of the instruments of production and administer them in their own interests through their accredited delegates."



The first page of "The Communist" of February 25th was 
devoted to an exhortation to "Vote Inkpin Out" of prison: he appears to be a candidate for the London County Council (St. Pancras, South West) as well as for the Middlesex County Council (Church Street Ward): the article in question points out that:

"The County Councils can control (more or less effectively), the police. They use then to bludgeon the unemployed and persecute and harry class-conscious workers. Very well them. We will use the police too, we will use them to shut down as &apos;dangers to the public peace&apos;, meetings of the paid hooligans of the capitalist class - you all know the organisations we mean. We will use them to prevent the importation of blacklegs which would cause disorder. We will play hell up with their pretty little side organisation for stifling the workers."



In regard to education the writer adds:

"Communists on the County Councils will be pledged to do their best, by themselves and through the Labour Parties, not only to stop this, but to reverse it. Not merely do we want the children properly taught and the teaching of &apos;patriotism&apos; stopped and jingo history books burnt. The children should learn the true facts of the world around them. Their history should be the true history of the working class. The Plebs League, the National Council of Labour Colleges, can answer for it that there are enough level-headed men about the country to do the job if it is necessary to import special lectures. Call it &apos;teaching the class-war&apos; if you like: we do not care. We mean to let these children leave school knowing the truth."

The acting secretary of the Communist Party has sent to all branches the following questionnaire which is to be presented to all Parliamentary Labour candidates: "the questions have been drawn up and endorsed by the executive committee of the Party" and "the answers, when received should be returned to head office":

A.E. Cook, the secretary of the Communist Electoral Committee, has informed Tom Clarke that "branches will have to foot the bill for public adoption meetings" but that head quarters will, if possible, help to meet candidates&apos; fares.



THE RED INTERNATIONAL OF LABOUR UNIONS

Nat Watkins, writing from Moscow on February 12th, informed his wife that "the outlook for the future of the work (i.e. of the Red International of Labour Unions) in England is exceedingly cloudy: the decisions with regard to it are not yet taken. The meetings are adjourned but will eventually be held about February 18th and during the following week." He added "Harry Pollitt has been ill ever since his arrival... I am shedding my superfluous flesh very quickly."



WILLIAM GALLACHER AND THE ENGINEERS

Gallacher, who is vice-chairman of the Communist Party and was during the war a violent opponent of military service, has sent to J.R. Campbell an article on the engineers&apos; wage question, for publication in "The Worker": it is possible that this is somewhat too strong even for this paper.

The following extracts are typical of the efforts made by communists to aggravate industrial difficulties:

"Encouraged by their successes in forcing down wages, satisfied with the strength and solidarity of their own organisation and the hopeless weakness of ours, the Bosses have come out to deliver the final and knock-out blow.

"We can retreat no further. All our strength must be gathered for the flight. Our desperate plight must force us into action with a courage we have never shown before.

"We must not go down. To go down further would be to forfeit the name of Manhood. It would mean abject-servitude with semi-starvation as our only recompense.

IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

Press Bulletins emanating from 3, Adam Street, Adelphi, are the work of Art O&apos;Brien, in the interests of  


of de Valera, and are covert attacks on the Free State. Friendly papers may unwittingly lend themselves to what is really Republican propaganda.

De Valera is reported to have started a new party organisation, with a committee in each constituency, to include representatives of the Irish Republican Army.

Some well informed people say de Valera knows he is beaten and will avail himself of the elections to climb down.

Charles Diamond&apos;s attacks in the "Catholic Herald" on Art O&apos;Brien have reached a stage when the latter can no longer afford to ignore them. Diamond is now publishing extracts from letters purporting to have been written from Ireland containing damaging statements with regard to the Irish Self-Determination League leaders, especially those in London. The "Catholic Herald" and its associated papers are widely read in Irish circles.

Sinn Fein leaders in Scotland and in the North of England are continuing the agitation for the release of the remaining Irish prisoners, Joseph Robinson in Scotland, Purcell and Barrington of Newcastle and Connolly of Cardiff are especially mentioned. They are talking of reprisals by the Irish Republican Army if something is not done soon.

Joseph Vyze&apos;s return to Glasgow has been marked by renewed activity in Irish Republican Army circles in Scotland. Arms, ammunitions and explosives are reported to be again in demand and are it is reported, being collected for transmission to Munster and the West of Ireland.
