THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,SECRET.CP. 5776,CABINET. FOREIGN ATTACKS ON BRITISH SHIPPING.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1. I desire to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the attacks whioh are toeing made, or threatened to toe made, on British shipping frcm various parts of the world.   The position of British shipping is very serious in that it is faced, at the present time of exceptionally severe trade and shipping depression, not only with these attacks, but with much more severe competition than it has ever had to meet before.   These attacks are briefly referred to below, but that of the Italian Government is tho most urgent and serious, and if we cannot successfully meet it, we will find it more difficult to resist attacks on other sides.2. Unless we can secure fair play for ships under the British flag in their foreign trade, we must be prepared for some of our principal lines making such terms as they can with the foreigners, with the result that they may be forced to leave our control altogether and go under other flags.3. The position In regard to Italy is dealt with more fully below, and it is suggested that the circumstances are such that the matter is one which should toe discussed with the Italian Prime Minister personally, at the Genoa Conference, or earlier if that be possible.4. The various attacks at present being made on our shipping, may be summarised as followsThe Italian Government have now cancelled the emigration licences of all non-Italian Lines for the period 1st January to 30th June 1922 and have announced that the agents of non-Italian Lines must not takemm
part in any emigration matters.   This means that the Italians have succeeded at lfcast in driving our Lines out of the Italian trade, though the exclusion is ostensibly only a temporary one.   There is little doubt, however, that unless very great pressure is brought to bear upon the Italian Government, this temporary exclusion will be made permanent, and the next step will be to drive the non-Italian Lines out of the whole of the emigration trade from South-Eastern    Europe passing through the Adriatic.The Germans, in spite of all the pressure that has been put on them, are still neglecting to carry cut their treaty obligations and give fair play to our shipping as regards the emigration trade from Northern Europe.   Their object clearly is to keep as much of this trade as they can for their own ships, and possibly also for the ships of their American partners.The American Jones Act is a measure intended to help the American Mercantile Marine at the expense of Its foreign competitors and is directed mainly against British shipping.   It has not yet been put into operation, but is on the statute book.   Further, it is reported that steps are to be taken to secure that a considerable proportion of the Immigrants to America-  shall travel in American ships.Hew States like Jugo-Slavla and Poland are introducing or contemplate introducing licence systems whioh discriminate against our shipping.Portugal has brought into force a measure giving preference to national shipping at the expense of British shipping.In Chile and Peru measures are being considered whioh will exclude our ships from the coasting trade of those countries.5. Since the war the importance of a strong national mercantile marine has become more generally recognised, and a method of encouraging a national mercantile marine whioh avoids the expense and political difficulties of a system of subsidies, is to give preferences of various kinds to national shipping at the expense of foreign ships.   It is a perfectly natural policy for foreign countries to follow, but British shipping will be the chief sufferer and the consequences may be very serious unless some effective remedy can be found.6. The policy I would suggest is that we should do all we oan to interest the Dominions in the maintenance of British shipping, so that in case of necessity the Empire may be able to aot as a whole in defence of its shipping.   This will require
time and patience, for the Dominions as large exporters are not inclined to be too favourable to shipping.   But they are beginning to see the other side *bt the question as weil, and they will realise in time that they depend on shipping almost as much as we do.   In the meantime we should use all the influence we possess In resisting each individual attack as it develops, for success in one base will have a moral effeot on the others.7. As the action taken by the Italian Government in cancelling the emigration licences of all foreign lines, is the most drastic step whioh has as yet been taken in the Interests of national shipping and is the one which will the most seriously affect the position of British lines, and as, if it be maintained permanently, it will lead Germany to attempt to pursue a similar course in regard to the emigration from North and North-Wast Europe, I think this should be taken as a test case.8. The Italians have for many years been aiming at excluding foreign ships from the emigration trade of Italy, and the recent United States Immigration Law, which reduces the Immigration into the States to 5 per cent of the Italian Population resident in the United States of America in 1910, gives them a good opportunity for carrying out this policy.   Foreign Lines are now excluded from this trade though ostensibly only&quot;for a period of six months, but they will find it difficult,, if not impossible, to get a licence again.   The next step will be in the direction of limiting to Italian ships the whole of the emigration trafflo passing through Flume and Trieste;   Indeed, it is already reported, that a Royal Decree will be published shortly extending the Italian Emigration Laws to the port of Trieste, arid that the intention is to issue another Decree applying the Emigration Laws to the whole of the Zionist Movement
from Trieste to Palestine.     This latter movement is composed principally of passengers from the Interior. This all points to the fact that the Italian Authorities intend, if they possibly can, to control all emigration from South and South-Eastern Europe irrespective of the nationality of the emigrants.9. The emigration trade from Italy itself, from which 890,000 third class passengers were carried to America in 1913 and the emigration trade from South-Eastern Europe through the Adriatic, are very valuable in themselves, hut the special Importance of maintaining our fair share of this traffic from the Mediterranean is, firstly, that without it, it will be almost Impossible to maintain our fair share of the emigration traffic from Northern Europe, secondly, that the emigration trade is the backbone of the Atlantic trade, as was shown clearly by the pre-war history of the German Mercantile Marine, and, thirdly, as I am informed by the Admiralty, that-fast liners would be of the greatest Importance to this country in the time of war, as fast troop transports, armed escort, ships, mine layers, and in many other capacities.10. There is no argument on Treaty grounds which we can use that is likely to convince the Italians.   It is doubtful whether the existing commercial Treaty gives ug a share in the Italian emigration trade, as a matter of right, though we have held it for years.   A definite written pledge was given by Dr. Giannini on behalf of the Italian Government to the Ministry of Shipping in connection with a shipping agreement, that there would be no discrimination, direct cr indirect, by Italy against British ships, but we understand that if we try to use this promise, it is likely to be disavowed.11. It is not possible, therefore, to appeal to theItalians on treaty or contractual grounds, nor would-threats of reprisals.-avail us much.    The possibility of- 4 -
reprisals by Great Britain in the economic sphere have been explored, but there is nothing which would be convincing to the Italians and at the same time not too harmful to ourselves, while the Dominions are not yet ready for reprisals of a wider and more sweeping character. Repeated representations have been made by the British Embassy in Rome, but without success, and it is believed that there are no further political arguments which could be used with advantage.12. The ordinary methods, therefore, have failed, but so important is the matter frcm the point of view of British shipping interests, that I approached the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with the suggestion that  a pressing appeal might be made to the Italian Prime Minister on the general grounds of Anglo-Italian friendship and co-operation, if a convenient time should occur in the near future.   I understand, however, that he is of the opinion that any such appeal to Italian good-will, even if made personally to the Italian Prime Minister would not be likely to meet with any satisfactory response - the prac-tiee of the Italian Government being not to make any concessions except as part of a bargain in which they expect to get rather mere than they give.   His opinion, I understand, is that the inly chance of remedying the present state of affairs would be to make satisfaction over the shipping question the price of some concession which Italy may wish to obtain from this country, and he is not aware, at the moment, of any matter which might be made the subject of such a bargain.13. If such an opportunity should occur in the near future during discussion cf any pact or reparation question I would urge that no concession should be made except as satisfaction over this shipping natter.   At the same time, I feel that the question is too important to leave to the
chance possibility bf Italy raising some matter, whether at the Genoa Conference or elsewhere, which might lead to a discussion of the position of British shipping in regard to the emigration traffic from South-Eastern Europe.14. I understand, generally, that at Cannes the Italian Government showed itself to he most anxious to assist and co-operate with us in our plans for the rehabilitation of Europe, whereas the policy now being pursued by the Italian Government in regard to shipping, must, of necessity, make causes of friction and render Intercourse more difficult between the nations - thus in part, at any rate, hindering that settlement which is desired as the result of the Genoa Conference.15. Our shipping is of suoh vital importance to us -its position is so critical, our Lines being dependent on this emigration trade * that I feel I must urge that every possible step should be taken to induce the Italian Government to adopt a different policy in regard to the Mediterranean Emigration Trade.   I would suggest, therefore, that the Italian Prime Minister should be informed either at Genoa, or earlier if the opportunity arose, that this matter is one of vital importance to us and that if no undertaking can be secured that the present discrimination will be removed, the matter will be   one which will cause His Majeaty&apos;s Government the gravest concern, as it must lead to a fundamental change of British policy.16. It might, .at the same time, be pointed out that a policy of confining national passengers and national goods to national ships, can only be successful until it has been adopted by other nations in self-protection and that if such a policy is generally adopted, it will
as stated above, not only make causes of friction and render intercourse more dlffioult between the nations, but must, in the end, be to the disadvantage of the countries whioh do not control a number of ports in different parts of the world.   The Italian Prime Minister might also be reminded of the faot that it was due to the allocation of British mercantile tonnage to Italian service during the war and to the British anti-submarine measures, that the many vital supplies necessary to Italy&apos;s existence ever reached that country, and that we cannot believe that Italy would now act so unfairly towards the service that stood her in good stead in the past, and might; in the future, be called upon to do the same.(Initialled) S.B.23.2.22.
