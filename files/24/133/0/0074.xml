(This dooument is the property of His Britannio Majesty&apos;a Government.)CABINET.! 3772.COMMITTEE OF HO MS AFFA1RS.JURIES BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE HOiiB SECRETARY.In August 1921 I called attention (CP. 3222) to the neoessity of passing a Bill early in 1932 placing the preparation of jury lists upon a satisfactory footing! and it was agreed that a Bill should be introduced at onoe in order that the oritioisms and suggestions of those concerned mi $it be considered before its re-introduction in 1922.   The Bill was accordingly laid before the House and published; and during the Autumn I have been in consultation with the different authorities concerned in the matter.   As a result of these conversations some amendments, mostly of a minor oharaoter, have been made, and a revised Bill i3 attached.   The printed Memorandum to the Bill explains its main provisions.As the Juries Aot of 1918 expires on the 28th February, 1922, the cumbrous and expensive pre-war system will be automatically revived unless legislation is passed this Session, and if the new system proposed in the Bill is to be adopted, the Bill ought to become law by the middle of April at latest, so as to give time for the new arrangements to come into operation before the first steps are taken early in May for the preparation of tho Autumn Register.Accordingly, I shall be glad to have authority without delay for the introduction of the Bill.February, 1922.8T. 170.
Juries Bill.MEMORANDUM.The existing system for the preparation of the jurors books in England and Wales, under which it is necessary to prepare and print separate lists of jurors, is not only antiquated, depending as it does in the main on an Act of 1825, but is also unnecessarily expensive. Towards the end of the War. the defects of this system were to some extent mitigated by section six of the Juries Act, 1918, which gave power by Order in Council &quot; for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary expense and labour&quot; to make modifications in the existing enactments; that Act, however, expires on the 28th February, 1922, and the provisions of section six cannot therefore apply to the preparation of jury lists in the present year.It is accordingly proposed by the Bill as its main object to do away with the preparation and printing of separate jury lists and to substitute a system under which the names of persons qualified as jurors will be indicated in the register of electors by means of a special mark, and the jurors book in each county will be made up from the appropriate registers, The cost of the new plan will, even in the transitional year, be very much less than that incurred under the existing enactments and in subsequent years will he altogether insignificant.The Bill will apply to the cities for which separate commissions of assize are issued, and will thus remove the difficulties which were temporarily met by means of the Juries (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1920, and the Henewal Act of 1921.There are at the present time certain small classes of persons who are qualified to he jurors, though they are not entitled to the franchise. Under the proposals of the Bill these persons will cease to be qualified as jurors, but except in this small respect t he Bill does not affect the qualifications for or liability to jury service in the High Court, at assizes, or in county courts. In the case of quarter sessions and other borough courts, how-ever, where the jurors are under the existing law drawn from the burgesses of the borough, it is proposed by the Bill that the qualification for and liability to jury service should in the future he the same as in other courts.9-7A
