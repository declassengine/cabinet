SECRET.CABINET. sj[ CQfflLITT.SK ,01 TOIOm lUITDgilTUBE ,UNITING.Memorsjadum Prepared with reference to cabinet (22), 2.It shea3.d &quot;be explained at the outset that tho Admiraltytfesming arrangements are basod on a dual allocation of personnel(h) in peace and (b) fth mobilisation,,     Of these the mobilisationallocation has always been regarded as the moro important:    it isa standing argument of the Adoiralty that men superfluous to peace requirements cannot be dispensed with &quot;because they have their stations in war,The Geddes Committee bring this dual all o cat ion of men out clearly by the quotation from the Admiralty Memorandum in paragraph 4, page 10 of the Report.    On page 11 of their Report they state in parallel columns the mobilisation distribution of men in the years 1914/5 and 1921/2.    The Admiralty do not averthat this table compares like with unliko\    but they complain that it io not sufficiently plain that it is the. mobilisation and not the peace distribution which is being set out:    that by working up to the ayors&amp;e figure for 1921/2 (122,700) which is 1,000 higher than, the figure for the last day of the year (l92l/  being a year in which the numbers of personnel were being reduced) the figure &quot;not otherwise accounted for&apos; &apos;9;OJ?0 is put unfairly high by 1,000, and that this point is over emphasised in the subsequent&apos; paragraph,     On the other hand as 1914 was a year of rising numbers of personnel and shows the final figure the comparison of the two years as shown is probably not unfavourable to the Admiralty standard of 1921/2.    This is. however, a minor matter,On page 12 of the Report the G-eddes Committee proceedto construct an estimate of the manning requirements of the.present day Fleet, again on mobilisation.     They take 68,600 asthe Admiralty5 s estimate of mobilisation requirements for ships iaHiTi
Group I.   For Groups II and III they take .63$ of the comparable 1914&apos; mobilisation figure:    in other Words they reduce it by 37$, that being the same percentage of reduction as the Group I. personnel figures bear to the Group I figures of 1914.&quot;&apos;   This, figure ,is 14300,.. but the Committee consider that of this number &quot;4347,:;;men could on mobilisation be found from Reservists or men from the Mercantile Marine, leaving 9553 as the mobilisation figure for active service ratings., ...They add 1500 for Coast Guard and 4000 for Cadets and Boys and thus bring the Mobilisation and Peace tables out as followsPeace.

The Geddes Committee did not fully sgt out the peace table,, and in particular the peace number of Coast Guard can only be supplied by inference:,   assuming this to be  ,600 the Peace Margin becomes 7.394,In all the above there, is no question of faulty arithmetic^ although the numbers allowed for Groups II and III and the sufficiency of the margin may be open to comment as. .. matters of opinion..      It will ..be seen that, the margin above given does not amount to 1.2,841 personnel, who, as stated on   -page IS of the Committee&apos;s report, can be employed for crossing reliefs, training in schools &amp;o.       This pould only have been the case if 4,347 of the 14,300 places in Groups II and ill had
been provided in Peace as well as on Mobilisation by Reservists or &quot;Mercantile &quot;iarlrie ratings&apos;.But ho-wer this may be the Mobilisation margin of 4,347 as provided by the fields a Committee appears to he nearly, if not quite, adequate to ne^t the numbers who nay be sink or crossing reliefs at the moment of mobilisation.    The principle on which the Committee ha^e proceeded in constructing their manning table is that if they provide adequate personnel for manning the Fleet on mobilisation, the peace requirements of the -Fiefit can and must be adjusted to the -nobilisation figure.. The main difference between the Admiralty and the Gedd-js Committee appears to be that the former ask for a larger Peace margin than the latter would have been prepared to recommend,The Committee appear to have, dealt with the Coast Guard not as they at present are, a Pensioner Force not providing Active Service ratings for the Fleet on Mobilisation, but as they might be, and were before the war *The figure for Cadets and Boys is an arbitrary figure which may be open to argument as insufficient,Officers[ Stewards and Cooks.The Admiralty statements off fact (page 13 of the. Churchill Committee Appendices ) must bo accepted as correct.    A private ship1s Quarter Bill   -   the number of men required to fight her   - is made out before the number of Officers&apos; Stewards and Cooks is made out,  shd those latter are all given war stations.     A Flagship carries in addition to the ;;ri^ate ship&apos;s complement the Flag Officer&apos;s servants.(Signad) G.L.PA^ST&apos;OVf,
