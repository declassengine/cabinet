MMT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAM10 UAWTW^HKMIVWRM).T.OABINEI , 0RE I i^QR CBIjE IT? S FOR INDIA.Copy of Telegram from Viceroy to the Secretary of State for India Ho. 22 of &quot;7th January, 1922*m    m    m* m22. 7/1,    I have lately been considering the questionof reinforcements for India in the case tf emergencies.   Inorder ts visualize future possibilities, there are fourcontingencies that must be taken into aecount:-lst. War with Afghanistan,2nd. Serious and widespread conflagration amongst frontier tribes.3rd. Seditien and disloyalty in the Indian Armyj involving mutiny in portions of that Army.4th, Internal rebellion consisting of simultaneous co-crdinated outbreaks in several places, similar to ilalabar,In the event of all four contingencies happening.simultaneously or within a few months of one another, we shouldrequiro at least six Infantry Divisions complete and four CavalryBrigades,   Presuming that either first and second, or third andfourth happen together, as they probably v/ould, we Should wantfour Infantry Divisions complete and two Cavalry Brigades,    Inthe case of each contingency happening separately we should require for the first, in order tc make simultaneous advance onKabul and Kandahar, three Infantry Divisions and two CavalryBrigades, (see Viceroy&apos;s telegram P1445 10th August 1921) far the sooend, third or fourth not in combination, we should requiretwo Infantry Divisions and one Cavalry Brigade,   In my view, itis improbable that all four contingencies will occur simultaneously,but that if they occur at all the first will occur in combination with the fourth.   Any of these eventualities except the thirdmight easily supervene in tho ntt distant future moreparticularly the fourth.
Second and last part.

If it so happens that all four of the above contigencies occur simultaneously and our demand for reinforcements cannot bo met from overseas, we shall probably be driven out of India. Should we be t war with Afghanistan and the frontier tribes, that is the combination of 1 and 2, and should you be unable to send us re-inforcements asked for above, it would mean that our campaign against the Afghans and tribesmen would necessarily become a defensive one, and it would then only be a matter of time for contingency 4, and possibly 3 as well to superveno, in which case again our position in India would be extremely serious. On the other hand, provided that Afghanistan is at peace and frontier tribes remain quiet, we could porbably deal with 3 and 4, oven if you could not send us the reinforcements asked for, but our ability to do so must almost wholly depend on how the mutiny and rebellion are dealt with in their initial stagos, and the numbers of units and area which are affected.

It is impossible to make any reliable prediction regarding internal (? security) and the Indian Army at the present moment but two points are worthy of mention:-

1. The organisation machinery which the extremist and seditionist Loaders in India control today has vastly improved during past year.

2.  All attemps to interfere with loyalty of 

/Indian
Indian Army, and there have been many, have so far failed. As long as we retain our (?present proportion of British Officers) and existing composition of our units. I have

every confidence in the loyalty of the Indian Army, though in view of the present seditious oampaign, it is impossible to say how long they will remain unaffected.   Requirements regarding the arrival are as follows:-

In any contingency leading Divisions and leading Cavalry Brigades should arrive as soon as possible for moral effect. Remaining Divisions and Cavalry Brigades alternately, one week&apos;s interval between arrival of formations. In first or second contingency, or combination of these two alone, remaining reinforcements to commence arriving in three months. In third or forth contingency, or combination of these two alone remaining reinforcements should follow as soon as possible. Requirements all four contingencies simultaneously, reinforcements up to four Divisions and two Cavalry Brigades as soon as possible. Remainder should commense arriving at the beginning third month.
