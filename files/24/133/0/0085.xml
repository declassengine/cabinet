0 A B I B E I. CABINET COMMITTEE ON PARTS,II AND III OP THE ^ INTERIM REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE JjN .NATIQNAL ETCPEMD IT PRE ^THIRD___REPORT .tEDUCATION   ESTIMATES.1.     In our previous reports (CP.3566 and C.P.3696) we dealt with the proposals of the Committee on National Expenditure respecting Health, Labour and Pension Services, and with the general question of the Percentage Grant System.     Thia Report Is concerned with the Committee&apos;s Educational recommendations.)SS REDUC^      2.     In Conclusion (6) on page 08 of the Interim Report, ifffi OPOSED   -      .the tittMH   the Committee on National Expenditure recommend thattm\--------,the Estimates of the Board of Education for the year 1922/23 should bo reduced from  50,600,000 to  34,500,000,. a reduction of  16,100,000, which,, with the automatic reductions, in Scotland will yield  18,000,000, and that whatever proportion of the reduced sum is to be paid to Local Authorities should be so allotted by the Board of Education that the vicious re-results of the percentage grant shall be terminated forthwith..3..     As regards the second part of this recommendation, the adoption of: our detailed recommendations will have the effect of fixing a limit on the expenditure on various forms of state-aided education during 1922/23. The question of the basis of the grants in subsequent years must await the examination of the vhole subject by the Special Committee-, the- appointment of which issuggested./
suggested in our Second Report (C,P.03696).4.     We have examined with tho greatest care tho. proposals of the Committee on National Expenditure, with a view to seeing whether the reductions suggested by that Committee can be obtained without inflicting serious and permanent Injury to the education cf the country.     After full consideration we have come to tho conclusion that in all the circumstances it would net be either prudent or practicable to Insist on the proposed reductions in full, and our reasons for adopting this view are briefly set out in later paragraphs cf this Report.5.     At the same time we are greatly impressed with the magnitude, and. rapid growth in recent years, of the financial burdens imposed on both, the Taxpayer end the Ratepayer in respect of educational servicesand wo agree with the Committee that the present educational, expenditure exceeds what the country can at pree-enfe afford.     In these circumstances wo have decided to recommend reductions which, if less than those oonteBipl&amp;* ted In the Interim Report, are substantial &quot;in themselves and can, we think&apos;, be realised without danger to our educational system^6.     The Committee oh National Eip expenditure draw particu-lar attention to the change in the proportion of educa^ tional expenditure contributed respectively by tho Taxpayer and the Ratepayer.     Of  42,500,000 added to educational expenditure between 1918/19 and 1921/22,  31,700,000 fell on taxes, and only  10,800,000 on rates As regards elementary education the Taxpayers1 share has increased from 46 per cent in 1913/3.4 to 55 per centin 1921/22./
in 1921/22.     The December- estimates of tho Board of -Education are based on an assigned expenditure by Local Authorities in 1922/23 on elementary and higher education of  77,800,000 to be met es follows:-Prom Taxes ...  42,600,000   or   M&apos;Q%From Rates.......0,      35,200,000   or   4c* %7.     The Committee recommend in the case of both elementary and higher education that steps should be taken to limit the Taxpayers * share to the statutory obligation of 50,% of a Local Authority&apos;s expenditure approved for grant.C.     It will be observed that this is not a reduction of expenditure but the transfer of a sum of   from three to four million pounds from taxes to rates,V,re think this proposal impracticable,     It would raise at once violent controversy as to the division of semi-local and semi-national services between local and. national revenues and,would give no relief to trade, and industry.   &apos; Tfe think that the proper time to deal with this question will be in connection with the Block Grant System.,

The saving to tho taxpayer   in 1922/23 io estimated at ,000.IS.       Tho Board of Education do not esonsidor that the attendanoa of ohildron undor 6 xi of essential value from the instructional point of viow.    What, tiese children require is rather a nursory than a school, tho present systom of   staffing by certificated and uncortificatod toachors is needlessly costly.     But we aro unable to agree with the Goddes Committee that ohildren undor 6 should &quot;be .excluded altogether from tho schools.   Tho conditions of many of their homes and the fact that the mo thorn aro engaged in work reojuiro that provisions should he made for thorn in  &apos; many areas alike on grounds of health and morals. On tho other hand, those considerations do net apply in Country districts generally and in some Urban districts,Wo recommend therefore that the attendance of children up to 6 should be made optional to the parents, but that the Board of Education should press for the adoption of more economical, methods of staffing these classes.E1EMEKTAKY  LUC ATI OH.
PJS OHO^LS.       13. I-ho Interim Koport states that under pre sentconditions many small schools are fcoing maintained at an unduly high cost per pupil, and suggests that unless stops arc takon to reduce tho cost of education in thoso schools power should he taken to withhold the grant in oases whore the children can equally well he educated at loss cost elsewhere.14,        We aro informed that a saving of about  200,000 per annum might ho ultimately, though   only gradually, realised if the closing of small schools oould ho sacurod;     if, however, tho prasont dual system could ho terminated very muoh more extensive economies oould ho effected in this direction.15.        Wo rooommond:-That ovary effort should ho made by the Board of Education to secure tho closure of as many small schools aa ma&apos;/ bo possible without reviving the   denominational controversies of the past.6
ISIOH OF     16.The Interim Report after indicating that if thojljffipfc-    standard of staffing wore revised in urban area oo thatthero were in future one teacher to every fifty pupils, the oaving would he  8,283,OOO; (of which  4,853,-000 would   -accrue to the Taxpayer), suggests that a revision in the standard of staffing should to effected as rapidly as circumstances permit.iy.       Wo consider that this estimate takes insufficient account of the structural conditions or schools and of the distribution of population, and i3 not in fact realisable -Wo aro informed by tho Board of $da-demobilisation that, after a oareful examination of the staffing pdeltion, we consider that the saving on tho regular staffs of schools might, without doing injury to education, amount to a minimum of 4,700 and a maximum of 6,60C teachers in tho next throe yeara--Shio oatimate in baood on the assumptions (a) that in every school with an avcrago attendance of 2^0 or loos, tho Head Teacher is made definitely responsible for a class of about 30;    and (b) that so far ao possible under the structural and other conditiohs of particular schools, every class has not less than $0 children on the books, provided that no class covers more than two yearsOf school life.     Such a reduction of 6,000 teachers might produce an ultimate caving of  1^200,000 in the L,B.AS&apos; expenditure, caUfeing a saving Of about  672,000 in the Board?s grants.     The Board propose to take these reductions in hand in the year 1922-23, and it is estimated that by those raeans the Vote may he reduced by  124,807.7/l8./
18.       Wq recommend for adoption tho propo&amp;sl^pf..tiio-Board of Education.19.       The Committee on Rational Expenditure after drawing attention to tho greatly increased remuneration granted to the Teachers under tho Burnham Committee&apos;a Reports, say that thoy see .no way cf making tho reductions necessary in national expenditure without, among other economies in many other directions, reducing the expenditure on elementary education,     This can only ho done by raising the lower age limit, by putting more pupils under one teacher, and paying the teachers less.       Thoy think the Teachers and the Education -Authorities should be ask*sd to face this facts20.       We have given careful consideration to this most important aspect of the problem. As indicated in the following paragraphs a very large proportion cf the increased expenditure on education is directly or indir-. ;tly attributable to the increased rerai negation paid to the Teachers, and very large savings could be immediately realised if the Teachers&apos; salaries were subjected to a percentage reduction of, say, 1^ or 20 per cent.      (A 20 per cerfroducti.cn would give savings of about ti% ,000,000, snailer percentage reductions would give correspondingly smaller savings.)     On the other hand, there is great force in the argument that it would, in all the clrounctances, be a breach of faith on the part of the Government to invite Parliament to .sanction the cancellation or alteration of/collective
bargains made by the Teachers with tho Local Authorities, inpursuance of the arrangements Got out in the Reports of the burnham Comtiitteec, which arrangements were subsequentlyapproved by Government,     In those areas where the Burnhanscales have been adopted, the acales are an integral part ofthe contract of servioo and while it is open to a LocalEducation Authority to dismiss a Teacher, the latter, ifemployed at all, is ontitlcd to receive the appropriateBurnham so ails remuneration during the period for which the collective bargains hold good, namely for terms of years ending in 1923 in London, and 1925&apos; in the rest of tho countryIn those circumstances we thought it desirable to confer with-prominent representatives of tho Teachora, with a viow to ascertaining whether the Teaching Profession would agree toaccept voluntarily some temporary reduction of remuneration&apos; .... aoad(by way of a percentage reduction of salary,   &quot;or the forsvgoing of increments) during the present period of financial stringency.   Wa regret to have to report that our representa-tions have boon wholly unsuccessful, and that there is no probability of the Teachers agreeing, on a voluntary basis, to a temporary diminution of their present emoluments, oroven to the foregoing of increments during the next 2 or 3 years.21.     We accordingly report:- ,,That   in cur opinion it would, in all the oir-cumstaneeo, amount to a breach of faith to invoke legislative authority to cancel or alter tho oblleotive bargains made by..the Teachers with the &apos;   Local Author it ies in pursuance of the Burnhao Report a,RING        22.     The Committ-ee on National Expenditure state on p.80 By) that having regard to their recommendations&apos; in the precedingsections as to staffing, remuneration, raising the lower age limit, and closing certain small schools, it should be possible to keep the anticipated expenditure of Looal Authorities upon the item &quot;Teaching Cost&quot; in 1922/&apos;23 with.:.:.: a figure of  36,000,000, instead of the  A5&quot;,000,000 foreshadowed by the Board of //Education

The Bo-ard of Education regard tho proposal to dismiss 34,000 of the 98,000 teaohers in Urban areas as a wholly impracticable suggestion)   hut they agree that, f. the option to withdraw from school children under 6 years of age, which is proposed in paragraph 12 above, would, if it were exercised to such an extent as to be universal, enable a reduction of 12,000 teachers ultimately to be made0i-7e are oiT opinion that reductions of staff in the Urban areas to a standard of one teacher to fifty children are not possible.   We haye already expressed the view that provision must he continued, though on a less expensive scale, for ohildren under 6, and that the possibilities of reducing the number of teachers by enlarging classes has been over-estimated by the Committee* V?e recommend that the Board of Education should steadily pursue the policy of a reflection of staff on the lines indicated in paragraph 17 o-11-

The Board of Education have satisfied us thatto reduce the provisional estimate figxire by en amountlarger than  500,000 would have detrimental consequences,and we accordingly&quot;- recommend  That the total expenditure recognised for. grant for 1922/23 in respect of Special Services, should not exceed  3;400,000-.&apos;4pAIHISTRATIOI?   29.

The InterimReport suggests that the latter figure should bereduced to  11,000,000, but we consider that theBoard of Education have made out a case for amore liberal provision, and we accordingly recommond j-That tho total expenditure recognised - .for grant for 1922/23 in respect of &quot;Administration and other Sxpenditure&quot;., should not exceed  12,000,000.

The interim Report remarks&apos; that &quot;the Board&apos;s Regulations provide &quot;that a minimum of 25 per cent of the places available shall be reserved for Free Place pupils from tho Elementary Schools., and we think that in the present circumstances this should be limited to 25 per cent&quot;.We are informed that the total ultimate saving to the Exchequer involved by this recommendation would not, on present numbefs of pupils and present rates of fees
foes, be likely to exceed  110,000, and would fall very far short of this figure in the year 1922-23. In view of this circumstance, and having regard also to the importance attached to those free places in the industrial areas of the country, we are not prepared to accept this recommendation as it stands. We think, however, that the Board of Education should exercise tho discretionary powers which it already possesses, to prevent an undue increase in the number of free places, and to decline to sanction any increase in the proportion of free placers to foe payers which at present exists in the country. 32..    The Interim Report, after pointing out that notwithstanding the&quot;recent increases of the fees, the latter are still considerably below the actual cost, recommends that the fees should be substantially raised throughout, ana that scholars,. whether fee paying or not, should not bo allowed to continue to receive State-aided Secondary Education if they do not show ability and industry, and effective periodical tests should be applied to ensure this elimination. .   ..We recommend that the Board of Education should take steps to secure, so far as possible, that the schools should bo restricted to those pupils who show sufficient ability and industry to make good use of their opportunities; and this applies with especial force to those pupils who receive aid towards the payment of. their foes, or towards their maintenance, from public fundstHowever advantageous educationally no financial saving would result from tho elimination of unfit scholars.The fees ara now being raised in most parts of the country and the Board of Education arc now considering what further increases may be justified.
33,   The Interim Report mentions certain High Grade Secondary Schools as being In receipt of grants, and doubts whether the public Is in favour of grants of public money towards the cost of educating children whose parents can well afford to defray the whole of the expense themselves *     The Committee consider that the Grants List stands greatly in need Of revision,34.   T.&apos;e agree that steps should be taken to revise the list of Secondary Schools recognised for grant, with a view to the exclusion of any schools which In the opinion of the Board of Education could continue to be conducted in an efficient manner without assistance from the Exchequer.35.   The Interim Report criticises the system which has grown up of Local Authorities&apos;contributing to the cost of non-provided Secondary Schools in their areas-... In such cases the school not only receives a direct grant per pupil from the Board of Education, but expenditure incurred on its account, by the Local Education Authority, attracts the 50 per cent Exchequer grant as well.     The Report suggests that whero a school receives financial assistance from a Local Authority, the direct grant from the Board of Education should cease, and no further grant should be made to that school, except-through the supporting Local Authority as an Intermediary.36.   tie agree and recommend that the proposed change should be spread, over a period not exceeding five years.
37.   The Interiiii Report suggests that progressive development in Technical Fducatlon should hepostponed until the financial situation of thecountry is better, and also that the cost should be capable of reduction.The Report makes no specific recommendation as to the  continuance of the ContinuationSchools under the recent Act,     These are inoperation in London, but in other parts of thetocountry the Act has not been put in/force. &quot;We recommend -(1)   That the compulsory continuation schools should be suspended, and (2)   With the concurrence of the Board of Education, that the estimate for Technical etc. Schools he reduced to  3,750,000, as against their July forecast of  4,000,000.38.   The Committee on National Expenditure pointout that if their suggestions as to the revisionof the standard of staffing in Elementary Schoolsare adopted, the reduction of the expenditureon training, would shortly be possible, though in consequence of students who have commencedcourses being still in residence, the full effectcannot be felt in&apos;1922/23,     The Committee considerthat the question of fees paid by students shouldalso be reviewed.     These to-day are about  30 pepannum for residence, and  5.10*0 for non-*residence,and should be brought into closer relation with thecost, which averages for resident and non-residentstudents  79 per annum per head.     If it is decided not to reduce the Teachersf emoluments, the case fora more drastic revision of this expenditure is greatly strengthened. . --16,, 1,F&apos;e recommend/
IIP TO BTUD&apos;^ITS.(39)     &apos;&quot;&apos;e recomend:&apos;-(1) that tho Board of Education shouldeffect the largest possible reductions in grants for the Training of Teachers, con-sequential on the reduction in the number of teachers, and that effect should be given with the least possible delay to the proposal that students who have had a full secondary education should take&apos;a one year course in a training college, and not a two year course a3 at present, (2) that the Training College fees be reconsideredo 40.     The Interim Report points out that many Local Authorities give Maintenance Allowances to Elementary SchoolpftESrlty children attending Secondary Schools, and Scholarships to[Expenditure -.&quot; &apos;Trlder pupils proceeding to the University..   This expenditure is, subject to certain restrictions, subsidised by the state to the extent of 50 per cent, and the State&apos;s share may eventually reach a maximum of &apos; 8C0,000 per annum.   TheReport considers that the whole question of these.grants should be reviewed,41.     The Board of Education2s latest estimate for the expenditure of Local Authorities on this service is  1,400,000,  as against the July estimate of  1,769.000. re consider that the-figure for 1922/23 should approximate to the 1921/22 estimate ( 1,319,000), We r ecommend;-That the expenditure recognised for grant in 1922/23 under this head should, not exceed  1,300,000, and that the Board of Education should institute an enquiry into the growth of expenditure on maintenance allowances and on fees paid for students*
42.     The Committee on National Expenditure remark that in addition to subsidising the activities of the Local Authorities, the Board of Education also grant direct certain scholarships, studentships and exhibitions, the cost of which for 1922-23 was provisionally estimated at  215,000,They also refer specifically to the State Scheme of University./Scholarships, which has been recently, introduced by the.Board, and which forms one item of this sum of  215,000, . .They recommend that with the.exception of the present holders this scheme of State Scholarships at the TJnivorsitiec .should cease, and that the remainder of the studentships should, for the present be limited to the present-holders..43.    /&quot;Te. think that the State University Scholarships stand on a different.footing from the rest of the expenditure here referred, to.   Local Authorities have -powers to grant . scholarships tenable at the Universities, and many of them do so, and are-aided in doing so by grants from the Board of Education o ..The State Scheme was intended to supplement the effort-made.by Local Authorities,* but it is - open; to question whether the end.aimed, at is achieved-    Equality of opportunity to students from different areas cannot be  afforded unless a preference is gi^en in -awarding State Scholarships to students from, areas where the Local Authorities are backwardIt is impracticable to.give such a,preference .under a national scheme; and if it were&apos; practicable it would - he .&quot;&apos; /wrong .

i!ARY. HIGHER CATION.44, The Board of Education1s original forecast of the&apos; Local Authorities&apos; expenditure on HigherGrant s^jto&apos;S?uVhorities. Education in 1922/23&quot; was  16,200;000, but this figure has since been ,reduced by tho Board to  14 , 000,,000.     The Interim Report suggests that the expenditure recognised for- grant should be limited to  11,000,000 in 1922/23, with an intimation that by 1925 the Local Authorities must obrlforrn to the 1920 expenditure cf  7,400,000/    It should be noted that in 1913/14 the expenditure was  4,402,00045,     We are much impressed with the rapid growth of - this, expenditure in recent years, but doubt the prac-practicability of the figure ( 11,000,000) suggested by the Committee for 1922-23,     In all the circumstances we recommend;-That the expenditure recognised for grant of Local Authorities should be limited to  13,000,00.0 in 1922-23, and that the question of a further reduction in respect of 1923-24 should be considered later in the year. - -After taking into account the Residue Grant ( 807;000) paid from the local taxation account, the grant chargeable to the Board&apos;s Vote on this expenditure will be  5,693,000.LDlretfojendltur^bj &apos; ijoard. on&quot;  lier&quot;Mucat ion,46.     The Interim Report suggests that in the case of direct expenditure by the Board on Higher Education, ioQ\ grants to non-L,,E,A, institutions and Aid to Students, etc, the net provisional forecast figure  2,570,000 should be reduced, to  1,350,000 (if the reduction.  1,000,00 0 represents a transfer to Local Authority expenditure)*
V&apos;e are Informed by the Board of Education that the&apos; expenditure in 1922-23 will consist almost entirely of grants in respect of the academic year ending July 1922, which is already far advanced, and that it. is not practicable to withdraw or amend the regulations on the&apos; strength of which the Governing Bodies have made their engagements until the close of that year,&apos;On the&apos;basis.of the latest returns available, the direct expenditure of the Board In 1922-23 will be  2,511,.847..   /Account has been taken in reaching this figure of such economies as will be secured in 1922-23from our recommendation on paragraph 50 above..47..     We recommend :-That the sum to be Inserted in the estimates for1922-23 in respect of Higher Education should be 8,,204,847,. made up of(a) net grant in aid of Local authority expenditure,,  5;.693,.000 (paragraph 45 above)and^   (b) direct expenditure by the Board- . ,  2s511j847 (paragraph 46)*-  MISCELLANEOUS EXPENDITURE.-48.     The - Interim Report suggests that a 25 per cent reduction should be made on the.1921/22 figure, viz, to 195;000 in respect of the Museums under the Board ofEducation.We agree.
49.     The interim Report suggests that this item should ho reduced from  879,807 to  850,000.- &apos; The. Board&apos;s . Doc ember estimate, is . 8,43-,000.Tho Board should consider whether expenditure on administration cannot be further reduced,    but as it is clear that some temporary additions to staff will be required in 1922-23 to initiate the proposed changes in tho Superannuation scheme wo are unable to recommend a total reduction in tho total figure proposed by the Board .50.      The Interim. Report recommends that a 5 per cent levy should be paid by the teachers in raspact of their superannuation rights; on tho basis of the reduced salary hill which the Interim Report contemplates, this would yield  2,000,000 in 1922-23; if salaries are not reduced it would yield  2,300,000, the assumption in either case being that the levy is universal and is applied as from the 1st Aprils51.     The present -superannuation -schema ,iS&apos; based cn the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1918, which   . represented a groat advance on any provision made by former ActSc     It is important to observe that the question of teachers1&apos; superannuation was dealt with on generous lines before tho great increases in pay which resulted from the recommendations of tho Burnham Committee.     That teachersf salaries would increase was foreseen, but the rapidity and extent of the increase went far beyond what was antici-patou in 1918,     Could tha actual rise in salaries have boon foretold a scheme on less generous line to would, no doubt, have be-ah proposed to Parliament,
But, ovar an;; above this, the actual form of tho superannuation scheme which relates pension to salary produced the reaiarkablo result that.-tlwr--gx^l^tnAr^as^&quot;&apos;^ in salaries which&apos;might reasonably have boan hold to justify less generous superannuation provision has involved the Exchequer in an immensely increased liability for Superannuation.&apos;In all the o ircumstances it&apos; appears to us that- the proposal in the Interim Report is sound in substance and that it is not unfair to require a contribution of the nature suggested from Teachers.52.     There are - other - features of the Superannuation system into which enquiry should bo made as suggested in the Interim Report.     Tho application of the system of lump&apos; sum grants on retirement to a service in vahioh Women predominate (-the reverse conditions to that prevailing in the Civil Service) also requires considera--tion, although not mentioned in tho Interim Report. Tho existence of this lump a urn provision might in any year in which teachers retire in exceptional numbers place a large and unexpected burden on the Board&apos;s Vote. In a review of the teachers superannuation system this matter will require consideration.It ia obviously impossible that such a review asis requires -should be undertaken by us; -52.    &apos;7e therefore recommend. :-.tii t the present superannuation scheme should immediately be reviewed by the Board of Education in consultation with the Treasury and the Government actuary, that &quot;tho new system should be&apos; on a contributory basis, ana that) the contributions should be so fixer, that thoy jail produce (when &quot;-died to any other economies which may be effected) a diminution of charge in 1922-2? Of not less-then  2,300,000.
54. In tho meentima our proposals ss regards tho Board&apos;s Estimates for 19 22-23 ara(1)    That the Board&apos;s Miscellaneous Expenditure, which contains provision for taachars1 pensions should be reduced by  500,000 below the figure of the board s Docamber estimate.     This reduction will be possible on the supposition that annuities are substituted for lump sums; and(2)    that receipts from Superannuation levy should be provided for, at an estimated amount of  1,800,000.-. This amount will bo possible on the suppositions (a) that legislation will bo passed so as to become effective from the 1st April, 19 22, establishing an optional contribution of bfc on the salaries of teachers and (b) that the terms of tha option will be such as to be attractive to a large proportion of the teachers.Whitehall Gardens , B PJ.. 28th February, 19 22.
