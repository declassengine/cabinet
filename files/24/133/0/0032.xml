Sj3CB3T.t QA3IIE T0,P.,3731. AiiD DAIRIES (SCOTLAND) ACT, 1914..Mem or and urn by tbe Secretary for So ot land.I have under consideration the question of bringing Into operation the Milk and Dairies (Scotland) Act, 1914.    The Minister of Health refers, In item 5. of G., \,3668; to the corresponding qu es ti on in Emgl an. d.Represcntations have been received from various looal Authorities in Scotland j including Glasgow, Lanarkshire and. the Convention of Royal Burghs, urgikng very strongly that the Milk and . Dairies  (Scotland) Act, 1914, should be put into operation,    The Milk and Dairies - Acts Postponement Aot, 1915, provides that this Act shall not come into Operation until sttoh date,, not being later than the expiration of one year after tho termination of the wot, as the Scot&quot;klsh Board of Health may by order appoint c;    Aooor dingj.7, failing legislation, tho Scottish Aot would come into operation at latest&quot; at tho end of August.I agree with the Minister of Health that it would not be right under tho existing financial stress to put into operation any provisions which wo ill el place further financial bur dens either upon tho State or upon Looai Authorities.. I understand that the Minister of Health proposes to meet tho dlffioulty by introducing a Bill repealing certain provisions of the Milk and Dairies (Consolidation) Aot, 1915, (Tho English Act), whioh involve   additional expenditure, and allowing tho other provisions of that Act together with certain additional provisions to oorno into force.In jmy opinion that is not . the best method of dealing with tho problem in Scotland.     While I entirely agree that the present
is rot a suitable time, for imposing any additional burdens either on the State or on Local Authorities, I think that it would be unfortunate if important provisions which received parliamentary sanction, after protracted negotiations between the, variousc-nflicting interests, in the shape of what was praotioally an agreed Bill, were- to be repealed purely for financial reasonsbefore they had even been given a trial by being put into ope railI am satisfied that, apart from these financial reasons, thegrounds which existed for their enactment in 1914 are as strong,thenot stronger, at/present date.     Onoe they are repealed it may be difficult to re-enact them.     It seems to me that it would be difficult to give-Parliament any good reason for their repeal. On tho other hand, there is very good ground for suggesting that the time has not yot cone, for putting. them in foros and that they should be suspended, until the financial condition of the country such as to justify their being put into operation,I would therefore-ore suggest   that the Milk and Dairies Acts Postponement :Aot, 1915, should bo repealed and that power should bo given to&apos;bring the Milk and Dairies (Scotland) Act, 1914, into operation on-such da to; as tho Scottish Board of Health may appcir.-provision being made, that different, dates may be appointed for different provisions of the Act.     In appointing the dates the Board would, :of course , have regard to the finanoial obligations involve 3 In the various provisions .  - ....I: see&apos;no-objection to the appointed dates being fixed by Orders-in Council -instead-of by the Board,,- the Orders nob to repel effect until tho drafts, have -been approved, by resolution of both- -Houses of Parliament.
I would further suggest that the Bill to give of foot, to. this proposal should extend the provisions of the Milk and Dairies (Scotland) Aot, 1914, so as to authorise the malting of Orders by the Scottish Board of Health -(a) for the grading of nilk *- Which I understandtho Minister of Health also proposed to deal with&apos; &apos; in England.(b) prohibiting the sale of milk otherwise than by Imperial measure - a provision at present in operation under a Ministry of Food Order for&apos; Scot*-land which will lapse In August, but which in my opinion should be retained.. I should be glad to. have authority to introduce a Bill -cm the foregoing lines.     .   ,   , ; &quot;*- &apos; -&quot;     :&apos;vr- -(SD) A     ROBERT MHNRO.Soottish Office,14th February, 1922.e
