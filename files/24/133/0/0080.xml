I DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT&apos;&quot;.Cabinet. L.Q.69.la. :     **Overseas Settlement*. Memorandum by the Minister of Health;In my  memorandum, G *? .3690, dated the 4th of January, 1922, I referred to the necessity for furthering overseas settlement In relation to unemploymenti and incidentally meiiiloned the soheme put forward by the premier d  the ^oiironwealth of Australia as One worthy of consideratidn,     I have now seen a telegram dated the 18th February asking whether Mr. Hughes ban have an answer to the telegram (sent as long ago as the 24th November) In whioh he put forward his scheme.     It appears from the last telegram that the Commonwealth Government has already completed arrangements with the Government of Western Australia for the absorption of a minimum of 25*000 migrants on quite good terms.     I submit in the strongest manner thai these Australian proposals deserve an immediate answer and that the whole question deserves immediate consideration by the Cabinet.-    As Chairman of the Unemployment Committee, I aim more and more impressed each day with a view that unemployment is a factor with which we shall have to reckon for years rather than for months. I saw on the 22nd instant a very strong deputation from South Wales, which oame up to warn me that the time is at hand when local authorities will be unable to meet the rate burden resulting from unemployment without direct aid from the Government, over and above the assistance direct and&apos; indirect which the Government is now providing.    Inocimeotlon/
conneotIon , with this deputation, I had before me figures of comparative output now and before the war from the Department of Mines, the plain inference from which is that unless there is vast development In the South Wales area, the area will havo to carry a latfge surplus population for an indefinite period.     This position is by ho means confined to South Wales, and I 6an see no permanent solution without a very vigorous policy of migration, one elomont in which must bs td give, o.g. a man whose trade has boon mining, a chance of Making good overseas ia new conditions, as the alternative to Remaining wholly or partly supported by the rates or the taxes. ,   I therefore press for immediate Cabinet consideration of the Australian proposal and of the general programme of the Oversea Settlement Committee (CaP.3582).A*; MONDv 24th February, 1922,nistry of Health.
