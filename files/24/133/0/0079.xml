The membership of the Amalgamated Engineering Union is over 400,000, but about 25$ are unemployed or on short time.The communists continue to work for a &quot;United Front&quot; of Labour and the idea has received some support from the ohairman of the Independent Labour Party.Information regarding the dispatch of money from Indian sources to Saklatvela is given in this report.
THE UNEMPLOYEDThe announcement that the period of unemployment benefit is to be extended has done much to relieve the fears of the unemployed and to stiffen their resistance to professional agitators: the latter are disgruntled as they were making much capital out of the alleged discontinuance of the benefit.Demonstrations to Guardians continued last week, Lambeth, Shoreditch, Stepney and Lewisham being visited:   on,the last occasion the unemployed attempted to rush the gates but were dispersed by police: in most cases, the ranks of the local unemployed were swelled by contingents from neighbouring districts.On February 16th, 10 of the Southward organised unemployed took possession of 5, Massenger Street,, but left at the request of the police on the following day.On February 19th George Lansbury, speaking at Leytonstone, said that it would be as well if the unemployed looked the workers in their factories in order to remind them that there were thousands outside starving: his speech was inflammatory and he suggested that a couple of demonstrations on Princess :Mary&apos;s wedding day would put a stop to the contemplated &quot;pomp of ceremony costing money, when down in the slums people are starving.&quot;   The national Administrative Council.of Unemployed has considered a demonstration on February 28th in order to attract attention but it is doubtful if they will run the risk of public indignation.Little material change in the unemployment situation in Lancashire and Cheshire is reported: in some cases .Guardianshave/
have been obliged to lower the scales of relief and meetings of unemployed have been frequently held in protest.   Mrs. Tin has been very active in the Manchester district.    She took part under an assumed name in a demonstration to the Salford Guardians on February 18th and induced the unemployed to take possession of a largo hall at the rear of the offices.   When addressed by name by the local police she quickly disappeared. The organised unemployed in Salford are truculent and revolutionary: on this occasion one man was arrested for assaulting a constable.J. Holt of the National Administrative Council of Unemploji has addressed meetings in Coventry, Mansf:ield, Nottingham and Birmingham: Worcester unemployed have demanded increased relief from their Guardians and have been refused: Smethv/ick uaemployei have been severely rated by Mrs. Flattery for their apathy.Tom Dingley, who has been so active among the Coventry unemployed, now intends to organise Stoke Heath, Foleshill, Bedworth, Kuneaton, Rugby, Kenilworth, Warwick end Leamington.It is reported that in the West of Scotland the unemployed are greatly dissatisfied with tne cut in wages   or relief work.REDUCTIONS IN WAGES - - \    . * ;There are indications that the workers in various, industries intend to offer resistance to further wages -reductions and it is possible that the trade union leaders will have some difficulty in restraining groups of their members from drastic action.My correspondents in Liverpool and Newcastle assert that the rejection of the terms offered to shipbuilders is &quot;a foregon conclusion&quot;.The Amalgamated Marine Workers&apos; Union, which is well sprinkled with extremists, has flooded Hull with the followingleaflet/

On February 18th J. W. 3owen, the general Secretary of the Union of Post Office Workers, speaking at Stoke-on-Trent, said that there was   danger that the Goddes Committee would attack the wages of postal workers but he was satisfied that the Union could bring the staff together quickly, organise public opinion, exercise Parliamentary influence and bring together all constitutional means of preventing the attack.The Maesteg miners have finally decided to withdraw theirnotices but there is a good deal of restlessness in the South. l*Ii.&apos;H     1c     $iocl Wales Coalfield: this is particularly marked in the Nine MilePoint Collieries, Ynysddu, where the miners -brokeiinto the manager&apos;s office on February 20th as a protest againstalleged &apos;Ttyranny&quot;:   they- threatened to throw the company&apos;3agent into the - pond&apos; and marched him&apos; away, detaining him untillie signed an undertaking to pay the mininrum wage-to certainman.

THE COMMUNISTSThe current issue of the &quot;Labour Monthly&quot;, which is editedby Raji Palme Butt, publishes the thesis on &quot;The United forkingClass Front&quot; whioh was adopted by the Ssecutive Committee ofthe Communist International on December 18th, 19E1.    The kernelof this thesis was given in resort Do. 141 but there are a fewpassages in the Hobcow document which bear repetition:&quot;The Communist parties nov oan, and should, reap the reward of their struggle carried on earlier under&apos; the very unfavourable circumstances of indifference among the masses.. But while&apos;there is developing an ever-increasing trust in the irreconcilable, fighting Communist elements of the working class, the mass of the workers as a whole are being moved by an unprecedented attraction for unity ...&quot;The Executive Committee of the Communist International finds that the watchword of the Third World Congress of the Communist International,  &apos;To the Masses&apos;.1 and the interests of the Communist Movement in general, demand from the Communist Parties and from the Communist International as a whole support of the watchword of a united working-class front and the taking of the initiative in this question into their hands.   To this, end it is necessary, of course, to formulate the policy in concrete terms according to the conditions and circumstances obtaining in each country. ...&quot;The task of, t^e English Communists is to carry on an energetic campaign for. affiliation ... The iangliub Communists should at. all-costs exert themselves to get among the mass of, the workers with the&apos;watchword-&quot;of tiie united working-class front, against the capitalists ... !,.; ,&quot;.Tbe Executive.Committee of the Communist International counts as a primary and fundamental condition, of general application to the. Communist Parties of till countries, that every Communist Party which enters into any agreement with parties of the Second or Two-and-a-half Internationals should retain absolute independence and complete autonomy for jthe expression of its views and for the criticism of its&apos;opponents.    Imposing on themselves a discipline of action, it, is obligatory, that Communists should preserve for themselves, not only up to and after action, but, if , necessary,, even, during action, the right.and possibility of expressing their opinion on the polioy of all working-class organisations, without exception.   The rejection of this condition is not &quot;permissible under any circumstances.   While supporting, the watchword of the maximum unity of all working-class organisations, Communists, in every practical action taken against the oapitalist front, must not on any account refrein from putting forward their views, which cre/only the logical expression or- the defence of the interests of the working class as a whole.&quot;R. C. Wallhe^d, cheirman of the Independent labour Party and. executive member of the bureau of: the Vienna international, comments as follows on this.; thesis;&quot;The /
&quot;The Executive of the Moscow group blundered badly.   Acting upon tho assumption of the noar approach of world-wide revolution, it sought to establish&apos; by dictatorial methods particularist sects.   Had Moscow been prepared to establish a less narrow platform, thereby gaining, the adherence&quot; of the mass organisations of the workers, it would.  I believe, have succeeded.   Here in Britain I am -positively certain that the Independent Labour Party would-have joined the Third International if the Executive of that organisation&apos; sitting in Moscow had adopted a less dogmatic method...&quot;Happily it would apposr as though, in faoe of the ceaseless activities; of capitalist reaction ail over the world, the spectacle of the different working-class organisations, reviling and fighting one&apos;another with a greater virulence than they displayed in lighting their capitalist enemies, is coming to&apos;a &quot;conclusion, and the &apos;Thes6C&apos; of the-&apos;-Executive - Committee of -tire Moscow group of December -18 last on 1 The- United-Front&apos;&apos;&apos; is very,welcome, as indict ting the Possioility of utilising the full concerted follow of the international working class against capitalist exploitation and parasitism.&quot;v/hile, however,&apos; most heartily welcoming the&apos;&quot;.- important pronouncement-contained in the main conclusions of the - &quot;Theses&quot; .j d&quot; r - hone s, it&apos;is permissible&apos;to&apos;suggest, might have&apos; been&apos;--pouched -in &apos; loss-truculent /terms.&apos; -The-Moscow Executive does not contain till the sincerity and good faith of the -Socialist movement, and the constant&apos; -  ;   charge of   treachery&apos;* against&apos; all who differ with &quot;Moscow serves &quot;no useful purpose&apos; -. .* - &quot;&quot;The Joint task which confronts the Socialist and- Labour world movement is: altogether too big- for &quot;anything approaching - permanent division.   That way lies, futility end defeat.    I am, therefore, profoundly thankful that Moscow has isshed its &quot;Theses&apos;, end sincerely trust, that our joint efforts will result in conference for &quot;the purpose of securing unity in action, ultimately^ lead ing to a united organisation of; ah international character.&quot;Arrangements have.beeti&apos;made to hold the:Policy conference to which reference was made in last woek&apos;s report and to which great importance is attached1 by the Communist Party -inDevonshire Hall, Hackney: all-day. sessions will be ;held:onMarch 18th end 19th: only :those&apos;&apos;&apos;bY-a-hphes -&apos;wtflcb &quot;ftaye *;&amp;et^ledtheir dues to the end&quot;of -Ded-ember 1921 will -iye:p&apos;ermitt&apos;edrepresentation: all branches will be lev.ie.d_ on&apos; a&apos;&quot; systemgraduated in relation to the&apos; cost of railway fares.    &quot;Ttie&quot;Arrangements Committee&quot; has prepared a list &quot;of the. cheaper andmore homely hotels in the central area of London&quot;&apos; and tho oentraloffice at King Street will be open -through the night of Marchfollowing/
The following circular has been sent to provincial organisers from Communist headquarters:

"As you are already aware, the policy conference has now been definitely fixed for the 18th of March, and I am taking this opportunity of notifying you that you are expected to be in attendance on this important occasion.

"At headquarters, it has now become a definite weekly practice to hold co-ordination meetings of Heads of Departments, and at the last meeting held, several matters in connection with "The Communist" were brought to my notice and I am anxious that Divisional Organisers should use their influence in their respective ?sons to stimulate comrades to send in reports to the ? of "The Communist" concerning all matters of importance which may have  occurred in their locality. It is very desirable and in accordance with instructions from the Communist International that the pages of "The Communist" should give&apos; full publication to workshop grievances and matters generally which bring into bold relief the dictator-ship of Capitalism. Therefore you will see the necessity of ample material being at the disposal of the editor for this purpose. I would suggest that wherever possible committees of efficient comrades be set up for the purpose of giving constant ways and means developing the circulation of the paper.

"This is most important, and such work calls for constant attention."

At the request of E. W. Cant, London organiser if the party, Frank Tanner has drawn up the following appeal for an L.C.C. election fund:

"Appeals for financial aid are so frequent and Communist pockets so light that only a situation of extreme urgency could justify the opening of another Special Fund.

"Unfortunately such a situation has arisen in connection with the expenses of Communist Party candidates at the forthcoming L.C.C. election.

"Some months ago certain comrades eligible for nomination as L.C.C. Candidates asked the advice of the Divisional Executive as to whether or not they should accept. Following out the declared electoral policy of the Party the E.C. urged them to do all they could to secure nomination: at the same time stating that financial difficulties should not be allowed to stand in the way.

"This will naturally be interpreted as a pledge to meet, if necessary, a substantial proportion of the expenses incurred. Obviously this cannot be met from the ordinary funds of the London District Council. Hence the only course is to opan a special fund for the purpose.

"There is no need at this stage to stress the agitational value of participation in municipal contests. nor/


- a -nor to mention the inexpediency of letting down comrades who have loyally carried out the instructions of their organisation.&quot;In Report No. 142 mention was made of the fact that ChamanLai, who appears now to he the general secretary of the AllIndia Trade Union Congress, bad informed Saklatvala,:the prospective labour comoniniet parliamentary candidate-f orBattersoa, that ho hoped financial arrangements;could be made tocarry on propaganda in England:.. &quot;on February&apos; 3rd he sent thefollowing letter to S&amp;klatvala, which appears to have relationto the above mentioned &quot;hope&quot;: it is also of Interest in regardto the &quot;finances&quot; for Saklatyala1s election campaign and to Mr.3owerman, M.P., tho secretary d-f^;i1heV&apos;&apos;iP^^iei^.ta:ry- -Cbmtaittee ofthe Trades Union Congress^ .:!&quot;&quot;Thanks for your cable.  . 200 have been cabled to you. - I-do hope.you;have,&apos;^jre^^A^^a^^iis^i   The1 Trustees have also,&apos;sent, 400Y, No receipt has been passed to them, beyond a&apos;: 6rjj&amp;^written to Potter Wilson.

THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE

Secret documents which have come into the possession of this Department show that the Moscow Executive of the Young/

 
young Communist International is taking an active interest in the progress of the Young Communist League of Great Britain: the intermediary between the two bodies is a man named "George" in the Berlin, whose indentity has not yet been established. Writing from Moscow on January 28th, 1922 the Executive regrets the leck of support given to the league by the Communist Party of Great Britain and promises to "talk" to the delgates in Moscow (i.e. MacManus and Bell): the Executive attaches great important to "educational" work and asks for a report as to the kind of literature required for publication in ?ngland , the communication continues "We agree with you that the work should be conducted within the Socialist Sunday Schools.. Re Finance we must tell you that actually we are ourselves in a rather awkward situation, but we shall do our best to assist you as good as we can. For the next few weeks, however, there is nothing much doing.

On February 7th "George" sent a long document in which instructions of Moscow were embodied:

The economical question is of the greatest importance, and I must say that in this direction much more must be done. We must publish facts about boy slavery, starving wages, unemployment, deadlock in the question of the apprentices, ex-soldiers which are being obliged to leave the country they fought for etc. All these questions must be raised in our paper and the paper must reach thousands of young workers in town and country...

"To-day the Party has understood already the importance of the Youth movement and it is to be hoped, that besides the help given up to now (financial help above all) the Party will from now on also support the Youth morally...

"You must help the Divisional Councils to get ahead with the Organisational Work. Get in personal touch with romrades, where, it is possible (London) and write friendly explanative letters to others (Manchester, Openshaw, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, etc.) We have a nuclei of good and willing comrades there and it should be possible to build up strong, active branches with the support of the Party, our theses will be of great help to you. I shall discuss other means of support with the E.C. for instance lantern slides, pictures for your paper, etc., - About all this I shall report to you in due time."

This week a quantity of documents has been sent to this country/
