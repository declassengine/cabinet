secret. g g 4CP. 3791. XV      Referred toCommittee of Home AffairsTHE CABINET. (Home Affairs Committee.)PREVENTION OF FRAUD (GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS)BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR. In July, 1920, my predecessor circulated two draft Bills : (a.) The Prevention of Fraud (Government Contracts) Bill, which made it an offence to mislead a public department as to the nature, quality or quantity of any goods supplied or&apos; services rendered. . (b.) The. Government Marks Bill, which made the forging of a false Government mark, or the tampering with a true&apos;one, an offence- under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887. That Act, in its turn, makes it an offence to forge or falsify a trade mark or to apply a false $rade description to any goods.The draft Bills were considered by the Home Affairs Committee in August, 1920, when it was agreed that the two Bills should be combined and that a new draft, incorporating certain amendments, should be prepared.The combined Bill, entitled the Government Marks and Contracts Bill, was circulated on 1st March, 1921.Meanwhile,&apos; the President of the Board of Trade had circulated to the Cabinet a draft Merchandise&apos; Marks Bill, and it was subsequently decided that such provisions of the proposed Government Contracts and Marks Bill as related to Government marks would be more appropriately included in the Merchandise Marks Bill.In November last, the President of the Board of Trade accordingly circulated a revised draft of the Merchandise Marks Bill, Part II. of which embodies the provisions relating to Government marks ; this Bill is at present before the Home Affairs Committee (CP. 3491).^-The proposed Government Marks and Contracts Bill lapsed, and the provisions in it which dealt with prevention of fraud in Government contracts have not since been proceeded with. It is. however, desirable to proceed with these provisions in a separate Bill, and I accordingly circulate for approval a revised draft which embodies certain amendments agreed upon by the Home Affairs Committee.The Bill perpetuates the provisions of Regulation 45 (1) (h) of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, which during the war was found, in practice, to be a necessary supplement to the ordinary law. At the suggestion of the Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions, who has had much experience of the difficulty of successfully instituting criminal proceedings in cases which arose before the war, the present Bill has been drawn to apply to any goods, and not merely, like the above-mentioned Regulation, to war material.L.
