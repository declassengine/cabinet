fllS DOCUMENT IS THE PROP;F.Tlr CP I: IS BP.ITMNIQ MAJESTY &apos;S i GOVEPKMIITT. Iret.f&quot;37&apos;19. &apos; M.H.45.EOMS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.GUARDI&amp;WSHIP ETC. OF INFANTS BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.1.      It is doubtful whether the promoters of this Bill have appreciated all,the difficulties likely to arise under the provisions of Glauses 3 and 4 as at present drafted.     Clause 3 proposed that the father and mother of every legltmate infant shall have &quot;equal authority, lights and responsibilities with &quot;regard to such infant, any rule of law or equity heretofore &quot;enforced to the contrary notwithstanding&quot;.     Clause 4 proposes that the father and mother shall be &quot; jointly and severally &quot;liable for the cost of the maintenance and education of such 11 infant according to the means of such father and mother &quot;respectively&quot;.2,    &apos;  It is assumed that the intention of the promoters tvas to regulate and adjust the relations of the two parents inter so with respect to the matters mentioned in these two Glauses, so as to ensure that in the future one parent should not be entitled to claim any rights or responsibilities to the exclusion of, and against,, the other.     But it has apparently been forgotten that there are many cases in vrhich   responsibilities imposed by statute upon one parent or the other are enforceable at the instance of third parties, acting in the public interest, against that parent, and, if the Bill becomes law; such third parties may find themselves in a position of great difficulty in the fulfilment of their   public functions,*        3.       This Is especially the case where a statute imposes a duty upon the father of an infant, and neglect of the statutory duty involves him in a criminal liability.      If the Bill becomes
law the liability would seem to attach in future equally to the mother; but a criminal liability which is divided between two persons, is, as every lawyer knows, an exceedingly difficult- one to make effective.     The point is well illustrated by the provisions of the ratification of Births Act,1907, which in the oase cf the birth of a child makes it the duty of the father &quot;and &quot;of any person in attendance upon the mother at the time cf,    or &quot;within six hours after, the birth&quot; tc give hot ice to the Medloal Officer of Health of The district within 36 hours after the birth. Failure to give notice involves liability to a penalty on summary conviction, but the Act provides that a person shall not be liable to the penalty if he satisfies the Court that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the nctice had been duly given by seme other person.     Prosecution after prosecution of doctor cr midwife for not notifying ha3 failed because of the existence of the alternative liability of the father;    yet there is an equal statutory duty to notify on all concerned.     It is impossible to doubt that where a specific duty at present laid upon the father is in future to be divided between father and mother, similar difficulties&apos; in the way cf enforcing the liability by criminal proceedings will arise.     Kcr does the Bill as drafted make it clear whether the liability of the twd parents in such circumstances is to be joint, several, or alternative.4. Analogous difficulties will arise under Clause 4.This Clause first makes the father and mother &quot;jointly and &quot;severally liable for the cost of the maintenance and education&quot; of the ohild, and then goes on to provide that such liability shall be &quot;according to the means of such father and mother &quot;respectively&quot;.     The reasonable interpretation of the latter words would seem to be that the liability is to be proportionate tc the amount cf the respective means; but this is wholly
inconsistent with -the- notion., of a joint and jsererftl-^laMJJbyv. if those words are to he given their ordinary legal meaning. Prom the point of view of the administration of the poor law, the effect of the Clause would be to emasculate the existing statutes by rendering the liability limited whereas it is now unlimited.     At present if any impecunious person deserts his or her child, that person oan be prosecuted as a rogue or vagabond;   and it is the father&apos;s duty to obtain Poor Law Relief when this is required in the child53 interests,   The effect of the Bill would apparently be to divide this responsibility,, making it uncertain on whom the legal duty rests. Further, it would, seem that the clause might be read as reducing by half the liability of each parent in a case in which both had means sufficient to reimburse tho poor law authority for its expenditure upon the child., and to put upon the authority the onus of proceeding separately against the two parents in order to recover the moneys5.     The creel cf a child in a poor law institution is by statute taken to be that of its father,.     Where the creeds of the ,parents differ    (a not uncommon case) it would, under the Bill, be necessary to make an application to the Court,     Again, under the Fccr Law Act of 1889 a Board of Guardians has power to vest in itself the rights of an unsatisfactory parent e     If the Guar clans acstjrie the rigid a of the child1 a father under the Bill, the Court alone will be competent to settle a difference of opinion; between themselves end the mother.       It is noteworthy that the provisions of the peer Law Act of 1834 which enacted that the creed of say child in the charge of a Board of Guardians should be that professed by the child33 parents, was found unworkable in practice where the parents&apos; oreede differed, and Section 17 cf the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1868, was In consequence passed expressly providing that:- T,he child1 s creed should be that of the father if .asoertainaole, or in default,, that of the mothersm 3 &quot;
6.      A&apos;further illustration of the difficulties likely to be caused by the Bill is to be found in the Vaccination Acts.     At present it is the father of the child who is required to cause it to be   vaccinated; but if he makes a statutory declaration of conscientious objection, neither he nor any other person can be made liable to penalties if the child is not vaccinated.     Under Clause 3 of the Bill, it seems clear that the duty of causing a child to be vaccinated will rest equally upon both parents, and if the child is not vaccinated either parent who has not made a statutory declaration will be liable to penalties.     Yet if the views of the parents on the subject of vaccination differ, the tribunal to decide the question under the Bill will be the Court, who will be set an Impossible task in determining which parent&apos;s wishes ought to prevaili     If the rights and responsibilities of the two parents are to be equal in all respects, there would seem to be no sort of justification for holding that the views of either parent should prevail against those of the other,  and an absurd impasse resultsa7;       It is observed that rc provision is made in the Bill to meet the case of parents who are living apart voluntarily, or the case of one parent who has been deserted by the other.     The Impossibility of enforcing a joint liability, if the whereabouts of one parent are unknown is obvious. .  But cases may arise in which, under the Bill, a joint consent of the two parents will be in future required under particular statutes, as, for example, in the case of the marriage of minors.     If the whereabouts of one of the two parents whose consent will be necessary are unknown, another impasse is a necessary consequence cf the Bill as
at present- drafted,,8,     I cannot- suppose that these and other similar points arising in connection with statutes administered by them have been present to the minds of tho promoters of the Bill;    and 1 submit that if it Is decided to give facilities for it, tho promotors should be invited to confer with my department and with other Departments interested in the matter in order that some, at any rate, of the graver difficulties lihely to be caused by the Bill may be,  so far as possible, obviated.A o IvlOKD.16 th February, 19318.Ministry of.....Health
