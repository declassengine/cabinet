M-p0Ai, EANKEY-Whitehall Gardens8-.W.1. 14th February, 19 22.
Amendments to tho Opt en ant og the Lea ^gujg^of Na 11 ens ,yNow that the Lord pros id en t of the Council is baok in England, it is desirable that tho Cabinet should consider at an oarly date the amendments to the Covenant of the League of Nations adopted by the Assembly of the League last autumn.S0     The various amendments are aet out in detail in 00P0 Papers 3450, 3461, 3470 and 3477, ana the procedure adopted by the League is that each amendment Is embodied in a protocol,, which is to be signed on behalf of tho States accepting such amend mento3*     The Foreign Office has stated that It is desirable that each protocol should not only be signed on behalf of His Majestyrs Government but ohouibd subsequently be ratified by H.M* tho King,&apos;4U       Whilst approving of all the amendments they say that requirements will be met if the protocols are signed at Geneva at the mooting of tho 3rd Assembly next September; but there is -at least one of the amendments - that to article 6 - which it would seem advantageous for H,M. Government to accept formally without farther delay,   and for this reason it is suggested that the Cabinet should oonsider now all the amendment. 1 en blood&apos; and not deal with them pieoemeal.5,        The amendment to Artiole 6 revises the eoale of oon-tributic&amp;s to the League by the Members and supersedes the method of allocation aoobrding to the ruieo of tho postal Union by another method.6.     Under tho nev.&apos; eoale Great Britain&apos;s annual contribution will be inoreasod from  52,000 to about  90,000.    Of the fifty States Members of the League, 28 will pay less and 22 more than under the existing system, whilst in the British Empire Great Britain, Hew ^ealand^ and India vail pay more and Canada, South Africa and Australia less.
7. The Treasury and the Foreign Office have alreadysignified their approval of this amendment subject to a reservation (by the Treasury) that the form&amp;neht basis is to bo re-ocnsldorod in 1924 and is not to be regarded as binding after that date, unless it is definitely revoted by the Assembly; and at the last Council meeting in January the Rypresentative of E.M. Government ;-os authorised to announce that E.M. Government would pay approximately one half of their contribution for 192? on the now scale in two instalments in January and April, and thereafter the balanoe as soon as the now Article 6 of the Covenant was made effeotive.8o       There would, thus seem to be no obotaole to the amendment being formally a^provedby tho Cabinet in order that the protoool can be signed on bohalf of H.!vl. Government.9,,       Some advantage will undoubtedly be derived from the action of E.M. Government Inasmuch as at present there Is a tendency on the part of Members of the League to base their payments for the current year either on the now or the old scale whichever is tho more favourable to themselves,10.      In order to come into effect the amendments must be accepted by at least 26 Members of the League, and this number cVust include all states represented on the Council but the existing uncertainty has a harmful effect on the full payments necessary to Continue the sanctioned activities of the League, and until the intentions of the governments represented on the Council are known, it is difficult to ask the other Members of the League to deoide their policy in the matter, since non-ratification by a single Member of the Council would render any aotion on thoir part ineffective.11.     A good example would assuredly bo set by H.M. Government eocepting the new sosle of contribution now.    the Canadian Government is known to fool strongly that effect should be given as soon as possible to the amendment in question.    The
192protocol embodying the amendment ha a already been signed on behalf of China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Prance and Japan.12*     The amendments to Article 16 cannot be approved without further agreement with tho French Government (see CP.5470) * Tho matter has be on considered by an interdepartmental committee, whose report on tho linos on which representations should be made to the French, after consultation with the Dominions and India, will shortly bo circulated to the-Cabinet,(Sgd.) 0.
