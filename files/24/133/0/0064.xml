SUMMARY OP SUGUlSbTIOIlb FOR ARTICLES OF agreement to FO^^T^^BASIS^OF^A^RUoSIAM TREaTYf ;Briefly stated the &quot;proposals &quot;made &quot;provide as follows :-iecoffnltlon of debts.. Tub He &quot;Debta.I, That the Russian Government shall accept liability for the bonds of the public debt of its predecessors Issued in foreign currencies and for such of the bonds in roubles as are hold abroad.The Russian Government shall give to the holders of bonds issued in foreign currencies New Russian Bcnids for arrears of interest and for interest to accrue during the next five years. (It is proposed that no monetary payments in respect of any of the claims against Russia should be definitely required for five years). ,If the debt is in roubles, it is proposed that it be oon-verted at an agreed rate of roubles to the   and be covered by the Treaty in so far as the debt is hold abroad, and was so held prior to the date of the repudiation of its debts by the Soviet Government.i, That the Russian Government shall accept liability for the ...debts of municipalities and public utility undertakings held abroad and shall give New Russian Bonds on their account, the same provisions as in Clause 1 applying to rouble debts. Zt has been suggested that the holders of the bonds of theae debts might not be satisfied to be given in exchange simply rights against the central Russian Government, having regard to the possibility that the local authorities or undertakings may at some later date have their position restored.   It is proposed to make discreet enquiries as to the attitude of bond holders on this question. J7II. That the Russian Government shall admit a liability ofto the British Government:to the French Government:   and no other claims shall be raised between Governments on the one side or the other.Note on Clause IH*   This Clause is devised to cut the gordian knot of a number of complications and -difficulties.     We have olalms against Russia in respect of Government loans, certain bank balances, timber, etc.   Against these the Russians will bring forward various claims.     There are the questions for instance of Russian gold furnished to this country during the war, goods supplied to the Russian Government from this country which were disposed of to meet liabilities and certain balances In British Banks, in respect of which claims may be affected by de Jure recognition.   Moreover the question of sharing in German reparation may be raiced,- and the Soviet Government is understood to have compiled heavy claims for damages and losses on account of the action of the Allies in connection with the Archangel, Yudenitch and other expeditions. There would be a difficulty about entering into discussion of certain of these claims, while the examination of others would lead to intermln-able argument; and there are certain points which could not very well be referred for decision even to such a body as the Hague Tribunal.It is, therefore, suggested that the beat practical course la not to proceed to any compromises on principle or estimates of the sums involved under different headings, but for the Allies at some stage in the discussion at Genoa to offer the above Clause.
It is intended that the clause should he strictly confined to claims between Governments which should not be allowed to be mixed up with the question of indebtedness of the Russian Government to private individuals.As to the form In which this intergovernmental liability should be expressed there appear to be two alternatives. (1) The British, French and other Governments-might be given New Russian Bonds similar to thoJe to be issued to private claimants : these Bonds would be marketable in the same way as other similar bonds, but their amount would of course prejudice the value of those issued to private claimants^  (2) Alternatively the Governments might accept bonds similar in form and effect to those handed to the British Government by the French Government in respect of the Anglo-French war debt.Private Debts.IV.       That the Russian Government should accept liability to pay compensation in respect of goods supplied or services rendered to Russia; and also in respect of losses of private property, debts, etc., owing to the action or negligence of the Russian Government,   Wherever pqssible, by agreement with the Russian Government, claims should be extinguished by the restitution of the same or equivalent property on agreed terms.    In other cases compensation to take the form of New Russian Bonds.The basis of compensation is to be the value of the property on 1st November, 1917.Other countries would recognise a similar undertaking to-wards Russian citizens, but,  where a Government had to discharge a liability to a Russian citizen on account of one of its own subjects it should have the right to do this ii^ the form of New Russian Bonds at their face value discounted in respect of interest.^-Difficult questions arise as to the position of persons in this and other countries who have retained control of property belonging to Russian undertakings in which they -vere interested and which have been nationalise d*   It is uncertain whether the *&apos;   grant of de jure recognition to the Soviet Government may not enable that Government to require the property of the undertakings to be handed over to them, and consideration is being given to the method by which the interests of the British subjects affected may be protected.Note on Clause IV,    This clause gives effect to the undertaking contained in the ^rade Agreement.    The alternative is to limit the obligation to Russia and confine it to cases in which the loss was due to the action or negligence of the Soviet Government&apos; but the objections to this are that it would, give less to British nationals than they have been led to expect from the ifording of the Trade Agreement,  and also that under an obligation so qualified it would be most diffioult both to decide on the claims to be admitted and to assess them,
Debt Commission and Mixed Arbitral Tribunals.V. That claims for compensation under IV and any disputes arising under I and II should fee adjudicated upon by Mixed Arbitral Tribunals (one for eaoh State) with impartial Chairmen.A Russian Debt Commission composed of say five Russian representatives and an equal number of representatives of other countries, with an impartial chairman, should be appointed to set up tho Arbitral Tribunals and co-ordinate their operations.     The Commission should also deal with all questions arising out of the eonversion of aooepted Claims into Hew Russian Bonds, the issue of bonds, and any other questions connected with them.Compensation Bonds.VI. That New Russian Bonds should be issued for the purpose of compensation.     Bonds given in respect of any allowed claim should cover the amount of the claim, as fixed by the Arbitral Tribunal or agreed or otherwise provided for, with funded interest from November 1917 until five years from the present date.     All aooepted claims should rank equally.   Bonds should be subject to redemption to be fixed by the Russian Debt Commission. AThere might be provision for dealing with the funded Interest bonds before the expiration of the five years moratorium period if in the opinion of the Russian Debt Commission the rate of eoonomio recovery of Russia as defined by export trade or otherwise rendered this possible.7Restoration of Foreign Ecclesiastical and Charitable Property etc.    *&quot;       &apos; &quot;&apos;&apos; &apos; &apos;    &quot;     -      -        &apos;        1      -VII. .

ARTICLES OP AGREEMENT TO FORM THE BASIS OF A RUSSIAN TREATY.Eoonomlo and financial proposals. I - VI&apos;.Recognition and discharge of Public and Private DebtstThe Committee propose that there should be a Clause or Clauses sotting out in gonoral terms formulae for the recognition of liabilities followed by clauses defining responsibility more closely in particular oases, and setting up machinery for the assessment and payment of compensation.The question of how much ehould be inserted in the Genoa.Agreement will arise for consideration later.     The. lines which it ia suggested should be followed aro set out with explanatory notes under the five headings as follows.-A. Formula for Recognition of Debts,B, Note on Inter-Governmental Debts and Claims.C    Subsidiary provisions as to Private Debts and Claims,D. Mothod of Paying Compensation,E. Machinery for Assessment and Payment ofCompensation.The question of a possible Allocation of responsibility among constituent States of former Russian Empire ia being considered by the Foreign Offtoe.
, FORMULA FOR RECOGNITION OF DEBTS, (i)   The Russian Soviet Government accepts the financial obligations of its predecessors, viz. the Imperial Russian Government andthe Russian provisional Government towards other States andtheir nationals who are parties to this Treaty.(ii) The Russian Soviet Government accepts also :the financial obligations of municipalities or public utility undertakings toward other States and their nationals who are parties to this Treaty.(iii) The Russian Soviet Government recognises its liability topay compensation to private citizens who are nationals of other states who have supplied goods or services to Russia for which they have not been paid,  and also in respect of other claims for actual losses incurred by such private citizens, responsibility for which can properly be ascribed by a specially constituted tribunal, in accordance with the recognised principles of international law,  and/or of the accepted commercial law and practice of civilised countries, to the action or negligence of the Soviet Government or its agents, and the other Governments concerned recognise similar liabilities towards the citizens of the Russian Soviet Republic.
B. Inter-Covernmente.1 Debts and Claims.It is believed that claims for damages will be brought forward by the Soviet Government and will include damage to -Russia generally and losses sustained by individuals on account of the Archangel, Yiidonitch and other expeditions and to these may be added claims to a share in German Reparation.    Shere will also no doubt be claims of a difficult hind on account of eeianro of property which belonged to tho former Russian Government or Russian nationals, e.g. the Russian Black Soa Fleet.   Possibly the Russians may suggest the reference of all or some of tnese claims to a Court of arbitration e.g. the Hague Tribunal, but this will probably bo objected to.The Committee suggest that the best course will be to stop discussion of these matters and of the minor but complicated claims that will come up on both sides by putting forward at some stage at Genoa a clause extinguishing all particular claims by the Russian Government against other Governments concerned and vice versa and fixing the indebtedness of the Soviet Government to the other Governments at figures appreciably less than the war loans.As the form in which this intergovernmental liability should be expressed there appear to be two alternatives.    The British, French and other Governments might be given Kew Russian Bonds similar to those to be issued to private claimants; these would then be marketable in the same way as other similar bonds, but their amount would of course prejudice tho value of those issued to private claimants. Alternatively the Governments might accept bonds similar in form and effect to those handed to the British Government by the French Government in respect of the Anglo-French Uar debt.Among the questions which will give rise to claims are : -(1)    For gold supplied during the war, the Bank of England have in safe keeping Exchequer Bonds to the amount of  40,000,000, mada out by the British Government in favour of the Russian Government.   These bonds were non-interest bearing.    They matured at various dates, all now expired, and have simply reaiained unpaid.     The remaining  20,000,000 of gold which was sent off on 16th March, 1917, was to have been covered by interest-bearing Exchequer Bonds (5-^- per cent.) but these bonds were never actually prepared.     Under the suggested clause all these bonds would be cancelled.(8)    Goods had been supplied or were in course of being supplied to the former Russian Government at the time of the second Revolution, and were sold, appropriated, diverted or otherwise disposed ox to meet the former Russian Governments liabilities-.     Similarly there are liabilities on the part oi the former Russian Government to British Government Departments not covered by the deposit of Russian Treasury Bills.
(3)   Under the proposed olause the Bussiau Government would transfer to the British Government the balances lying to the oredit of the former Russian Government in British banks and have no claim to those which have been handed over by such banks to tiie British Government. Similarly the British Government1 s claim to any property left in Russia would be extinguished.(4)   The extinction of all claims to compensation for was losses, l.e. losses caused to Governments or to their nationals by the operations of war, would carry with it the extinction of claims in respect of requisitions of all kinds whioh may have been efxectsd in the course of war-like operations.Questions will come up concexning the claim of Hussia to the return of the 62 millions of gold dollars handed to Germany under the terms of the Brost-Litovsk Treaty and subsequently transferred to the Allies under the Versailles Treaty.      A sum of 23 million   dollars (equivalent to  6,581,000) which was used to pay off a part of the British share of the Anglo-Prench loan in America has been set of! against the Russian War debt to the British Government.
C. SUBSIDIARY PROVISIONS AS TO PRIVATE DEBTS AND CLAIMS.(1) Russian Government loans in foreign currencies will be revived but interest and repayment of capital due from the date when payments ceased until say November 1927 will be funded.(2) Municipal, Railway or Public Utility Bonds In Foreign Currencies will, if guaranteed&apos;by the&quot; State,&quot; be exchangeable into New Russian Bonds at prices equivalent, as near as may be, to their sterling value dependent on the interest rate, redemption rate and any special advantages or disadvantages contained in their terms of issue.     If not guaranteed by the State the con-version figure will be a percentage lower, the exact figure to be determined by the original value of the security.     Arrears of interest unpaid on account of the Revolution will be funded. &quot;it has been euggeated that the holders of the bonds of these debts might not be satisfied to be given in exchange simply rights against the central Russian Government, having regard to the possibility that the local authorities or undertakings may at seme later date have their position restored.     It is prcposed to make discreet enquiries as to the attitude of bond holders on this question. J(3) Russian Government Rouble Loans or Government^guaranteed Municipal, RaT?way or Public Utility ffiaids issued in roubles&quot; will if proved &quot;To TKve been acquired by the present holders before the date of repudiation by the Russian Government, be converted into New Russian Bonds on the principles enunciated in the Clause above, the rouble being exchanged into sterling as at the rate determined in IV (vii; below,(4) Factories, mines and other property In Russia which have been confiscated^ Wqirlsitloned orVdestroyed,(i) Claims for conpensatl-on for dispossession, destruction or damage will be settled by agreement so far as possible by the restitution of tho same or equivalent property on agreed terms. In default of agreement claims will be registered by the Russian Debt. ........
Commission (see  , below) and will be referred to Mixed Arbitral Tribunals for adjudication and assessment a? the amount of compensation on a monetary basis.(ii) A period of grace of 12 months will be Allowed for registration of claims, in accordance with procedure to he laid down by the Ihissian Debt Commission, subject to exception to-special cases.    &quot;The Russian Government will not be required to consider claims entered after the expiration of this period,(iii) The basis of compensation will be the value of the property on the 1st November 1917, as determined by the surplus of real or tangible assets over liabilities.    The Tribunal will have full discretion to consider whatever evidence may be available bearing on the value.(iv) The Tribunal will be empowered to make allowance for special circumstances which at that time materially affected the value of the property, e.g. abnormal and temporary Inflation In value ofa munition factory, or temporary diminution in value due to naval blockade in the case of an exporting business on the Black Sea. DEBTS    .(v) Where any property or any business which is restored by agreement under (i) above ;;/as on the 1st November 1917 subject to any obligation which may be the subject of a claim under the Treaty, the creditor may claim against the business or against the Soviet Government at his option, and in the latter event will be allowed an extension of time for the registration of his claim. But if the creditor claims against the Soviet Government and compensation is awarded the Soviet Government will become to that amount the  creditor of the property of the business.(vl) Where claims exist against a business for which monetary compensation has been paid, such claims will lie against the Soviet. Government and. not against any person who has received compensation^
compensation.(vii)   Tribunals will be required to recognise claims in respect of rights which legally existed at the time of the first Revolution (March 1917).(Difficult questions arise as to the position of persons in this and other countries who have retai ed control of property belonging to Russian undertakings in which they were interested and which have been nationalised.   It is uncertain whether a grant of do Jjzxa recognition to the Soviet Government may not enable that Government to require the property of the undertakings to be handed over to them; and consideration is being given to the method by which the interests of the British subjects affected may be protected).( viii)   Creditors of any property or business for which no compensation is claimed, or for which no compensation is granted, may claim compensation from the Soviet Government if they can establish a right v/ithin the meaning of the formula in (A) above,( ix)   The value   of the rouble will be&quot; taken as at the rate of exchange prevailing on the 1st November, 1917, i,e, about 35 to the  ,   Debts in foreign currencies will be payable in those currencies and debts in roubles will be converted into sterling at the same rate as that fixed for awards of compensation for property above,(Alternatively if the Russians successfully contend that this was an artificial rate held up by special restrictions a fair measure of depreciation of the rouble might be-afforded by reference to other European currencies, e,g, Yugo-Slavla, Finland, or by the average depreciation of all European currencies). (x)     Interest will be paid on all amounts allocated by way-IS-
of compensation as from November, 1917.     In assessing the amount of compensation payable to any oreditor the Tribunal will have regard to tho oapaoity of the property or business to meet the liabilities upon it at the period of tho Revolution, irrespective of the action or negligenoe of the Soviet Govern-ment, for whioh liability now restB on the Soviet Government under the Treaty. METHOD OF PAYING COMPENSATION,.(i)   All accepted olaims for monetary compensation will be met by the issue of New Russian Bonds up to the amounts fixed by the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals.   The terms of issue of the Bonds, together with all questions arising out of the conversion of existing Bonds of all kinds and out of the administration of the Bond Ibsxis, will be under the oontrol of the Ruaoian Debt Commission (see E below), (ii)   Other Governments oonoernod may discharge anyliabilities arising under the Treaty in the same bonds at their sterling value, (iii)   The Bonds shall oarry a rate of interest to bodetermined by tho RusBian Debt Commission and shall be subject to redemption by annual drawings, (iv)   They shall be a charge on the whole assets of the Russian State.(v)   Interest Bhall be funded and the Russian government shall not be required to redeem any Bonds for a period of five years from the signature of the Treaty.   For funded interest, BondB of a special sories might be issued.     Any such interest Bonds would oarry the same rights and be In all respects the same as the New Russian Bonds, except for a preferential right for redemption during the moratorium period if any redemption were then possible.     The Russian Govern-in ent should be permitted to make drawings if It desires to do so s&amp;ter the expiration of the moratorium period giving priority to the interest Bonds,
IB. Machinery for assessment and payment of compensation. * A Russian Debt Commission shall &quot;be constituted, ocmposedof not more than five Russian representatives, and the same number of non-Russian representatives, one eaoh being appointed e,g. by the Governments with the largest total claims against Russia, together with a Chairman to bo appointed by agreement or, in default, to be nominated by the permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague.     The Russian Dobt Commission shall oome to an end not later than one year after the payment of interest on New Russian Bonds has been fully resumed unless the Powers represented thereon desira to oontinue it for a further period. II.        It shall have the following functions:-(i) To set up and prescribe prooedure of the Mixed Arbitral, Tribunals and to take any measures &apos;necessary to Becure uniformity in their operations and In their decisions.(11) To determine all questions arising out of the issue, rate of interest, terms of redemption of the New Russian Bonds.(iii) To issue New Russian Bonds to persons entitled thereto-under awards of the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals and to holders of existing state Bonds and other Bonds and stock for which the New Russian Bonds are now to be given in exchange and where necessary to determine the amount of Now Bonds due.     The rate of interest adopted for the purpose of calculating the present value of claims being the same as that yielded by the new Bonds.(iv) To determine whether and to what extent Bonds shall be redeemed beforo the expiration of the poriod of moratorium in accordance with paragraph D v. The question of the possible allocation of responsibility among constituent states of Imperial Russia is being considered by the Foreign Offioe.
Restoration of foreign ecclesiastical, charitable property,, &amp;c.
