[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty a Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1922.SECRET.C.P.-3780. &apos;   3CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 20th instant.General State of the Country. Police Reports of the Week.The general situation remains substantially unchanged since my last report. Now that the police have been withdrawn from many parts of the country, it is no longer possible to obtain complete and accurate records of daily events, but from such information as is available from other sources, it is clear that there has been no diminution in the amount of lawlessness, and that in some districts, notably South Tipperary, disaffection in the ranks of the I.R.A. to the Provisional Government is on the increase. There is no evidence, however, to show that other classes of the population in these districts are becoming disaffected, and it is not improbable that one result of the depredations and exactions committed by the undisciplined follow-ing of Mr. de Valera will be to rally the more prosperous voters in a body to the side of Mr. Collins and his colleagues, whose continuance in office with a decisive majority of the electorate behind them presents the only possible hope of a return to conditions of settled and orderly government.Attacks on members of the Crown Forces again hold a prominent place in the Crime Reports of the week, and include four cases of murder, and two cases of attempted murder. One of the murders was that of a policeman, who was shot dead in cold blood by a party of armed men in Limerick City on the evening of the 18th instant. A comrade who was with him at the time was also fired at, but escaped. The other cases were that of a military officer (Lieutenant Gerochio, R.E.), who was shot dead in Cork City on the 17th instant, and that of an officer (Lieutenant Mead) and a Quartermaster-Sergeant of the R.A.S.C., the former of whom was killed and the latter mortally wounded in an ambush of a military motor lorry at Inchicore, x Co. Dublin, about 2-30 p.m. on the 20th instant. The full circumstances attending the murder of Lieutenant Gerochio have not yet been ascertained. He left his quarters in Victoria Barracks, Cork, in plain clothes on the evening of the 15th instant and was not heard of again until 11 a.m. on the 17th instant, when his body was found lying on the public road near the Cork Lunatic Asylum. It is suspected that he was kidnapped by members of the I.R.A., and confined in the asylum, and that he was shot in an attempt to escape. The Provisional Government state that an exhaustive enquiry is being held into the circumstances of his death, and have given an assur-ance that justice will be done. The ambush at Inchicore on the 20th instant was carried out by a party of about twenty men in civilian clothes, who opened fire at the lorry from behind a fence on the side of the road and then decamped. Another military lorry stolen from the Curragh was found on fire near the scene of the ambush. The murderers were apparently surprised in the act of: burning it by the approach of the lorry containing Lieutenant Meads party, which they probably imagined had been sent out for the purpose of its recapture. It is believed that this outrage was committed by members of one of the Dublin Brigades of the I.R.A., a section of which is known to be hostile to the Treaty. The Provisional Government have given the most explicit assurances that no efforts will be spared to track down the murderers and to bring them to justice.[7925]
The two cases of attempted murder of Crown Forces were a bomb attack upon four constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary at Ennis, Co. Clare, on the 11th instant, and the firing at two constables near Tuam, Co. Galway, on the 15th instant. No casualties were sustained in either oi these attacks. Other outrages com-mitted against the Crown Forces included the seizure of a motor car and three revolvers from a District Inspector and two constables near Castleisland, Co. Kerry, on the 13th instant; the disarming of three soldiers in Roscommon on the 14th instant; the disarming of two soldiers at Carhoon, Bandon District, Co. Cork, on the 15th instant; the disarming and robbing of two constables in limerick on the 16th instant, and the holding up and seizure of a District Inspectors car at Tralee on the 18th instant.A deplorable violation of the amnesty granted by the Provisional Government for all acts committed in the course of the recent hostilities occurred in Roscommon on the 14th instant, when an ex-soldier, whose only offence appears to have been that he was the brother of a man who had been a Crown witness in a Court Martial case at Athlone in July of last year, was dragged from his house by a party of armed men and shot dead.  None of the perpetrators of this callous crime has yet been arrested.Among the cases of ordinary crime reported during the week was that of the fatal shooting of two civilians in Donegal on the 15th instant. The full facts of this case have not yet been brought to light, but a man, who is stated to be a deserter from the British Army, was arrested by the I.R.A., and is being handed over to-day to the British Military Authorities.State of the Police Forces. The following figures show the present strength of the Irish Police Forces : Royal I?&apos;ish Constabulary.Strength on the 12th February, 1922 ... ... ...      9,939Deaths during week         ... ... ... 1Retirements        ...         ... ... ... 768Resignations       ...         ... ... ... NilDismissals or discharges   ... ... ... 1Total wastage ...       770Recruits ... ... ... ...        NilNet decrease       ... ... ... ...       770        770Strength on the 19th February, 1922    ... ... ...      9,169Note. The retirements shown above represent the disbandment of 18 members of the Veterans&apos; Division and that of 750 members of the Regular Force recruited in Great Britain during the past two years. The strength of the Veterans&apos; Division is now reduced to 32, and the number of British recruitments to the Regular Force is now reduced to 612, of whom 143 are stationed m Northern Ireland.Dublin Metropolitan Police.The strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Police remained unchanged at 1,134 throughout the week,Present Distribution of Royal Irish Constabulary in Southern Ireland.The process of concentrating the Royal Irish Constabulary preparatory to its disbandment is now well advanced. By the end of the current week all the barracks in the counties of Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary, Kerry and Monaghan will have been evacuated and arrangements are being made for an early complete with-drawal from South Tipperary, Waterford, Kilkenny and Wexford. In the Athlone Division, comprising the counties of Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath and Sligo, only nine barracks are now in occupation, one in Sligo and two in each of the other counties. The Kildare Division (Kildare, Carlow, Queen&apos;s County, King&apos;s County and part of Wicklow) has now been reduced to sixteen stations, the Galway Division (Galway and.Mayo) to eleven stations (one in Mayo and ten in Galway) and the Donegal Force to five stations. The whole of the Constabulary in Co. Cork have been withdrawn into Cork City.  A large number of small barracks are still being
held in the counties of Meath, Louth, Dublin, Cavan and North Wicklow, where the urgency for concentration as a protective measure is not so great.Present Political Situation in Southern Ireland.A sensational development of the Irish political situation was reached to-day, when an announcement was made by Mr. de Valera at the Ard Feis (Convention) of the Sinn Fein Organisation that an agreement had been arrived at between the leaders of the Free State and Eepublican Parties, to postpone a General Election until the Free State Constitution in its final form could be submitted to the electorate. The terms of this Agreement, as announced by Mr. de Valera, are as follows : &quot; In order to avoid a division of the Sinn Fein Organisation, and avert the danger to the country of an immediate election, to give an opportunity to the signatories of the London Agreement to draft a Constitution, so that when the people are asked to vote at elections to decide between the Republic and the Saorstat, the Constitution of the latter may be definitely before them,&quot; It is hereby agreed :   -&quot; 1. This Ard Feis shall stand adjourned for three months.&quot; 2. That in the meantime &quot; (a.) The Officer Board of the Organisation shall act as Standing Committee.&quot; (b.) Dail Eireann shall meet regularly and continue to- function in all its Departments as before the signing of the Articles of Agreement, and that no vote in Dail Eireann shall be regarded as a party vote requiring the resignation of the President and Cabinet.&quot; (c.) That in the meantime no Parliamentary Election shall be held, and that when held the Constitution of the Saorstat in its final form shall be presented at the same time as the Articles of Agreement.&quot;3. That this Agreement shall be submitted to the Ard Feis, and, if approved, shall be binding.&quot;The provisions contained in the third Article of the Agreement were at once put into operation by the Agreement being submitted to the Convention and carried unanimously amid great enthusiasm.H.
