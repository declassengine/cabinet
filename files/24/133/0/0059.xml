ESS.- DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS aiBLMNIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVSMMBMT.&apos;    281CABINET.Secret- .L.G.68.---. FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE,C.P.S7 57.Memorandum by the Minister of HealthyIn his Memorandum of the 14th February (CP,3730) on Foot and Mouth Disease the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries estimated the total cost of compensation for slaughtering infected animals, inclusive of administration and staff, at not less than  700,000, and added that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was willing that he should spend   v up to this amount.I now understand that it Is suggested that this sum should be paid out of tho Local Taxation Account, with the result that the Local Authorities will receive so much less out of that Account and will accordingly have to raise so much more by rates.I feel it my duty, therefore, to warn the Cabinet that, If this policy is persisted in, there will be a storm of opposition from the Local Authorities, especially in the urban areas which will be most heavily hit. The London County Council alone would have to raise some  135,000 more by rates in consequence of this raid on the Local Taxation Account,I admit that under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, there is statutory authority for this proposal, but I am quite sure that the Local Authorities would never have agreed to the arrangement embodied In that Act if they had foreseen that their contribution to the Cattle Pieuro-pneumonia Account would reach the total now to be provided.In no one of the past 2 5 years has the sum paid out of. the Estate Duty Grant to the Cattle PIeur.o-pneumonia Account
-exceeded  120,000 for Great Britain.     In Rome years the amount so paid has not exceeded  1.000*     The amount new arked for is nearly  600,000 in excess of the largest demand during the period mentionedvI may point out that, although the Act of 1894 contains a provision (2nd Schedule, paragraph 4)   that if in any year a surplus stands to the credit of the Cattle Pleuro-pneumonia Account that surplus may be paid into the Local Taxation Account for the benefit of the local authorities, this course has not been adopted in the past, and It is certainly a hardship on the local authorities that while they do not benefit by a surplus they should, be required&apos; to Pear any deficiencyeIn the present case the amount involved, is so large, and the urban ratepayers are already so heavily burdened, that I would strongly urge that the proposal to raid the Local Taxation Account should be reconsidered.A , M0 ED,,: 20th February, 1922.Ministry of Health,.
