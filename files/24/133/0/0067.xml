pfllS DOOM NT IS THE PiiQPEOT OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJE6WS GOTEiMBJKCABINET.fo.3765.Memorandum by The First jjord of the Admiralty. navy ESTIMATES ..,192.8^1923.The accompanying Memorandum explains the difficulties with which the Admiralty are confronted in seeking to respond to /the appeal of the Prime Minister to effect a further and substantial reduction in the Navy Estimates for 1922-23, beyond that already effected and proposed by Mr. Churchill&apos;s Cabinet Committee.The Admiralty are fully alive to the gravity of the financial situation and are anxious to do everything in their power, and in reason., to reduce expenditure., during the next two ,years, even at the cost of additional and temporary risks-&apos; to our national security.   But reductions of men, ships, fuel, and other naval necessities are of no value per se, unless they result in such a substantial saving of money that the loss of naval efficiency can be justified to Parliament and the country.Small economies can, of course, be effected, here and there, as a result of further and minute scrutiny of the details of every Vote, and by what have been called &quot;administrative refinements&quot;, but this process must take time and in no case can it produce savings which would materially affect tho total Navy Estimates.   One such item I may mention at once, the laying up of the &quot;Enchantress&quot;, which will be
forthwith put out of commission and no further expenditure Incurred upon her use or upkeep.But any additional and substantial cuts in expenditure could only be made, if practicable at all, in the big votes for personnel, dockyards and oil.     These had already been rigorously and repeatedly examined/ both by the Admiralty and the Cabinet Committee, but they have again been searched, in response to the Prime Minister&apos;s appeal, and the results are briefly set forth in the accompanying Memorandum*This latter can be amplified, if necessary, by more detailed explanations but the net conclusion is plain &apos;-that whilst&apos;,- of course, our standard of naval strength can be reduced to any extent which the Government deem necessary, and to which it can secure the assent of Parliament/ no substantial savings will result unless the reduction is to be permanent *       That, I understand, is not in contemplation and indeed it was expressly laid down by the Prime Minister in his appeal to the Admiralty that the &quot;One-Power Standard&quot; should be fully restored at the end of two years.If this Is the policy, and I can conceive of nothing less that would be tolerable either to the Government or to the Country,&apos; it will be clear from the accompanying Memorandum that the financial results of a temporary, two year, reduction of our naval strength would be quite insignificant and out of all proportion to the damage which would ensue to our national safety and prestige *
(Int.)   L. of   P.February 22nd 1922.The fact is that, as a result of the Admiralty&apos;s Departmental exertions, and of the drastic pruning of the Cabinet Committee, the well of economy has been pumped dry and the most energetic and willing efforts can now only produce a trickle - and that at a considerable risk to the stability of the whole structure.I much regret this slender result as a response to the new appeal which has been addressed to the Admiralty but, after all, there Is a limit to what can be accomplished and I would point out that if the figures recommended by the Cabinet Committee are accepted by the Government they will represent a cut of over  20,000,000 on the Navy Estimates of the current year, and of some  30,3500,000 (or 33 per cent) on the Navy Estimates which were current when I took office just twelve months ago.     Moreover the Estimates now proposed represent the equivalent of only 55 per cent of those of 1914, if the changed value of money is taken into account.These are immense results, for which   venture to think the Admiralty have received less credit than they deserve.
ffpfL 3765) 22nd &quot;88S DOCUMENT IS THE PROEi!RriJY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. )CABINET.Memorandum by the Admiralty.NAVY ESTIMATES 1922-23.Question of further reductions.The standard of Naval strength upon whioh the Admiralty have based their estimates of personnel and expenditure is that of equality with the next strongest Naval Power.     This is the standard that has been announced to Parliament and to the country.     Not only so , but it is also the standard that was explained to, and endorsed   by the Imperial Conference last summer, and it is the basis upon which the agreement just reached at Washington Is founded.The Admiralty aro asked In view of the financial stringency to accept for the next two years a further reduction of Naval personnel beyond the reduction of 20,000 Officers and men already proposed, and to put for-ward alternative proposals for such further reductions, stating the risks Involvod.After careful consideration tho Admiralty are unable to suggest any way of further reducing personnel that will not involve a reduetion of the number of Capital Ships to be kept in commission and in the strength of the War Fleet generally.A reduction of a further 10,000 Officers and men (bringing Fleot numbers &amp;o approximately the total suggested by the Geddes&apos; Committee) would necessitate reducing five moro Capital Ships to reserve and making reductions on the same scale in the numbers of Aircraft Carriers, Cruisers and Destroyers.     In no other way could the reduction of men be effected.This, however, would be inconsistent both with the Prime Minister&apos;s statement that there is no difference as to the number of Capital Ships to be maintained and with the maintenance of the existing Naval standard of strength which, as already pointed out, is the basis of the Washington Agreement.     Tho British Fleot as thus reduced would clearly bo considerably inferior In strength to tho United States&apos; Fleet, and taking account cf tho relative positions of Japan and Great Britain to the vul-nerable points of tho Empire, it could not even bo regarded as strong enough to hold Japan in check.It Is not therefore possible for the Admiralty to suggest further reductions of personnel unless tho Government will clearly indicate tho poroentage of Naval inferiority to the United States, and to   Japan, which they are prepared to accept as their now Naval standard.As
As regards the financial advantages to be obtained in the next two years by a temporary reduction if. personnel, it must be recognised that the savings must be oonsiderably diminished because the reduction will be , additional to tho reduction of 20,000 nifioers and forms&amp;f   y proposed by tho Admiralty.It is estimated that ordinary wastage and the offering of froe discharges will not produce a reduction of more than 16,000 during 1922-23, and that in order to complete tho reduction pf 20,000 special terms will require to be applied in the remaining 4,000 cases.     Tho extra expense under the non-effective Votes may possibly amount to  200,000 in 1922-23.If 12,000 more Officers and men are to be reduced the whole of this number will have to be dealt with under speQial schemes at a cost of, say,  650,000, whioh must be set against the saving of approximately  1,000,000 on wages, victualling, etc.As moreover the reduction of personnel is to be merely temporary, it must be recognised that it will not be possible at the end of two years to rely on normal methods for bringing personnel up to its normal strength. Owing to the length of time which Naval training oocupies, it would normally take nearly 10 years before wo again secured by normal means a trained personnel such as it is now proposed to discharge.     Consequently, it would be vgv.y necessary in two years&apos; time to take special and probably/&apos;y exponaive measures to attract back to the Navy the same trained men whom we are not/ going to induce by the adoption of spoolal measures to leave.Taking all the facts into consideration, it is probable that little or no actual saving will be realised ever this systom of discharging and re-entering men.     If a real saving is to be effected it could only be, as already stated, by the Government definitely adopting a nev; standard of Naval strength for the future without any limit of time.Proposed further Dockyard Cut.The Admiralty could offer a further reduction of 4,000 Dookyardmen which would provide a further exit of  500,000 gross.     This would necessitate the closing of Pembroke Dockyard as previously proposed.As a consequence, however, of this further out the officienoy of the Fleet would be considerably impaired, completion of construction oonsiderably delayed, recon-reconstruotion stopped, and the running repairs of the Fleet seriously delayed and hampered.At the same time, in view of the special appeal of the Prime Minister as regards the next two years, the Admiralty is prepared, if prossod, to accept the risks involve d.It is, howovor, necessary to point out that the 4,000 men who would have to bo discharged will bo men of considerable service in Government employ, and therefore entitled to a considerable sum in gratuities.     This sum, added to tho unemployment dole which they would receive, would reduce tho saving of  500,000  to little over  200,000.
The Admiralty do not consider that the great reduction to the efficiency of the Fleet whioh this cut would entail would he justified by the small amount saved.Proposed further Oil ffuel Out,Tho Admiralty point out that they have already forestalled tho Prime Minister&apos;s special appeal to accept risks for tho next two years in the vital matter of oil fuel.Provision has, in fact, been cut down to such an extent that the risk will extend for 3 years instead of for 2 yoars only.This cut was made by tho Admiralty with very groat misgivings, and could not have been justified but for tho instructions received from H. M. Government, and the knowledge that they are prepared to accept responsi-toility for tho risks involved in the Admiralty action.February, 1922.
