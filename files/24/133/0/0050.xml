[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1922.SECRET.CP. 3748.CABINET.THE IRAQ TREATY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I. I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a draft of the proposed Treaty with King Feisal of Iraq. The general policy underlying the draft Treaty, viz., the maintenance of a special relationship towards Iraq, was reaffirmed as recently as the 9th February by a Conference of Ministers, presided over by the Prime Minister. As my colleagues are aware, the responsibility assumed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of Iraq was embodied in a draft mandate, which was submitted to the League of Nations more than a year ago. So far as the League of Nations is concerned, the draft mandate remains the operative document; but it was explained to the Council of the League in November last that we intended to give local effect to our obligations through the medium of a Treaty with the Iraq Government.2. The present draft is the outcome of negotiations which have been in progress for the past three months between King Feisal and Sir Percy Cox, who was assisted by an official of the Middle Kast Department specially sent to Baghdad by air for this purpose. By the end of last year a tentative draft had been agreed upon in Baghdad,, This was despatched to London by the Air Mail and has been carefully considered, first by the Colonial Office in consultation with the Foreign Office, and finally by the Middle East Committee, upon which the Treasury, Foreign Office, India Office; Colonial Office, War Office and Air Ministry are represented.3. There is only one article, that relating to the method by which His Majesty&apos;s Government are to exercise control over the foreign relations of Iraq, upon which inter-departmental agreement has not been reached. In regard to this article (No. V) my advisers recommend the adoption of the wording shown in the third of the three parallel columns as printed below.. The Foreign Office favour that shown in the second column.   A decision on this point is required. ;4. I have communicated the draft Treaty in its latest shape to Sir P. Cox, and have authorised him to discuss it with King .Feisal. The latter&apos;s final comments are still awaited. In these circumstances I do not ask for final approval of the exact wording of the Treaty as it stands, but for the general authority of the Cabinet to proceed with the conclusion of a Treatylon the lines indicated. I also ask for a ruling on the wording to&apos;be adopted for Article V.^ &apos; - -    &apos;. : -: W. S.
