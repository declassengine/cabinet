IRA Q..,3708.Memorandum by the S, of S* for War,I circulate the following appreciation of the situation in Iraq, in connection with a 2d807recent telegram from the High Commissioner (No. 77,    dated 1,2.22).L.  w\  - E,The War Office,8th February, 1922.1, Consequent on the Cabinet decision that the admin-istration and financial oontrol of Iraq was to be taken overby the Colonial Office as from October 1st 1921, a paper vrasprepared by the General Staff revising the existing situation at that date,2e &apos;Briefly the situation then obtaining in Iraq was asfollows:-(a) Garrison.The Military garrison consisted of -1 Regt, British Cavalry, 1 Rcgt, Indian Cavalry. 1 Battery RaH,A-, 1 Brigade R^FrA, 1 Brigade Pack Artillery. 4 Battalions British Infantry, 14 Battalions Indian Infantry. 3 Armoured Car Companies. 4 Oompaiiies Sappers &amp; Miners. 6 Squadrons R, A.F.with the necessary complement of Administrative Services,(b) Lopal Forces.In addition there existed(i)   Arab Levies, numbering about 4,500 under british officers, and administered by the High Commissioner,(ii)   The Arab Aimy^ numbering about 1.000 (in training) This force was at the time (October 1921) in course of formation and had assumed no military functions. It was administered and maintained entirely by the Arab Government of IraqB(c) DistributionaThe garrison was distributed as follows -1 Infantry Brigade in tho Mosul area,, 2 Infantry Brigades in tho Baghdad area.The remainder of tho Infantry at the Base and at various points on the Tigris L. of C, the Euphrates line North ofNasiriyoh
Nasirlyoh &quot;being in charge of the Arab Levies, 3. It was proposed further to reduce the garrison duringthe winter 1921/22 to about 11 battalions on the assumption that peaoe was made with Turkey and the Arab Amy would, by March, 1922* be capable of assuning oontrol of the whole ol* the Vilayet of Mosul,      Tho strength of ihe Garrison was based eh the essential oondition that the arnod foroes were maintained solely for the preservation of internal order, and that tho foroes should not be called upon to defend Iraq from external attaok, 4* In reviewing tho possible directions from which suchan attack might oome the most likely was oonsidored to be an attack from the North West by the Turks, for by such action the Turks might destroy our power in the Middle Bast, please the French by overthrowing King Jeisal and recover part of the country lost in the Great War,5. In conclusion, the General Staff paper pointed out -(a) That when the Nationalist Turks had concluded their operations against the Greeks in Anatolia thoy might be expected to turn their attention to Iraq, in general and the Vilayet of Mosul, in part i cular,-(b) That while the foroes in the country, when reduced to tho proposed numbers, would be Inadequate to repel external attack, the total evaouation of Iraq was not a practical proposition owing to the existence of the oilfields at Ahwaz, and to the faot that wc had set up Feisal as King,(o) That, therefore, in ordor to repel an externalattack, troops would hare to be brought from India; and that as thi s would take six weeks at least even for one division, the Arab Army would probably have been defeated in the meantime, the Turks advancing through Mosul would have raised the tribes of the Euphrates, with the result that the garrison in Baghdad would find itself some 500 miles from its base with an organised enemy in front, rebelioua tribesmen behind, and probably the Baghdad - Basrai. railway out,(d) That the alternatives remained - either to retire to a line about Basrah oovering the oil-fields or to remain in Baghdad and stand a siege&apos; until a relieving force could arrive from India,(e) That to avoid the necessity of accepting either alternative,, any attack from the Kemalisto should bo prevented by effecting a speody friendship with the Turks as a whole,B,
1. In November 1Q21 a second paper was put up bytho General Staff in which it was pointed out that tho danger of a lationlist Turk invasion of Iraq had boon intensified by the following      .(a) Tho cossat ion of active operations between the Greeks and the Turks in Anatolia,(b) Tho conclusion of a Treaty between Franco andthe Nationalist Turks, by which the latter acquired the control of a largo area South of the Sevres treaty lines, the use of the Baghdad Railway to lisibin, and the town of Djeziro Ibn Omar on the Tigris Lorth of Mosul,(c) The Conference at Kara by which outstanding questions between Turkey and Russia as to the frontier between Turkey and the Caucasian States was settled.The effect of the above on the military situation, wasthat part of the Turkish forces hitherto contained by the greeks, French and Bolsheviks was freed for action elsewhere,,2. The number of tropps which it was considered that theTurks could, ot this timet  (november 1021) raise were(a.) From Greek Front . e9 12,5*00 rifles 60 guns,Jbj From rj-iiicia        , ,0     8,000     &quot; 30     &quot;(c) Prom Eastern Front..      5?000     &quot; 32     &quot;(d) Prom G,H.Q. and central Reserve s e u 0    7; 500     &quot; 16     &quot;(e) From Ivisibin - Bitlisarea ...    ,,,     3?000     &quot; 8     &quot;3. In conclusion the General Staff paper stated(a) That the kationlist Turks were in. a position to concentrate    against the Mosul Vilayet if they so wished,(b) That if such an invasion took placo, tha Turks would be reinforced by tribal lovics*The dangers visualized in tho two papers summarizedabove exist to-day; but aro intensified by the followingnew factors :--(a) The formation of the Arab Army has not progressed as quickly as had been hoped,(b) Similarly the Lovios are still in a backward state , and of doubtful loyaltya(c) Five Turkish Regiments have now moved eastward into the Lisibin area,(d)
(d) Risings have occurred at Rowanduz and in Suleimoniaarea, and, though, not definitely proved, it is thought that there is a conneotion between these two risings,(e) Continued increase of Turkish propaganda,,i(f) Increased unrest in Egypt,(g) Increased^unrest in India,Our troops in tho Mosul Vilayet at tho prosent are:-1 Indian Cavalry Regiment.1 British (How.) Battery R,3?.A,1 Indian Pack Battery.1 British Battalion.2 Indian Battalions.1 Boneer Battalion.1 Armoured Car Company.Their distribution io shown in Appendix &quot;A&quot;.Our latest information shows that the Turks, in the Jezlret Ibn Omar - tfisibin - Sairt area, hare the following troops with which they could carry out an immediate invasion.Turkish fighting troops 8,000 (Approx)Although the time of year is not favourable for a Turkish advance, and its feasibility at any moment is effected by weather conditions wo must be prepared for such a contingencyBut, in addition to the Turkish forces, we are faced with the probability, amounting to practical certainty, that any Turk ish invasion would cause an immediate rising. Thus, even though in the early *tagot our troops might bo sufficient to deal with the Turks, there would be every risk of their   being isolated and communication with Baghdad cut by the action of the tribes.Our garrisons in Mesopotamia were only designed on the assumption that there would be no external aggression, they are admittedly too weak to resist any serious attaok which the Turks aro in a position to carry out, and it has been definitely decided (see letter from S* of S. Colonies, No, 57291/1921 dated 3rd December, 1921, and S, of S, Colonies&apos;   Telegram No, 522 to Sir Poroy Cox, dated 14th November, 1921)   that no reinforcements can be sent to Iraq,
In these circumstances the darugers of delay are obvious. The situation may develop at any moment, and the local commander be placed in the difficult position of having either to withdraw in the face of the enemy or risk being drawn into hostilities,, Either of these alternatives would be most embarrassing - a foread withdrawal constituting a serious blow to our prestige with the prospect of a general tribal rising;   an offer of battle involving us in indefinite commitments from which ive have mo visible means of extricating ourselvea.It must be realised that the withdrawal of regular troops from Moeel will probably be followed by the loss of that Vilayet to King Feisul.     If there were any prospect that a few weeks delay might ena.ble the Arab Army and Levies to become sufficiently organised and trained to cope with the situation, this would be a very strong argument for our postponing the evacuation until the last possible moment.     This, however, is not the case, and, as a &apos; military proposition, there appears no hope of these local corps, either now or in the near future, being capable of opposing any organised aggression.Thus, every military consideration points to tho desirability of an early evacuation of Mosul.   We propose in any cj-.se to withdraw by the 1st April, 1922, and, by starting to do oo at once, there is every prospect of being able to complete at our own time and in reasonable security a move which, with every day&apos;s delay, is more lively tc be forced upon us with all the attendant evils that such enforced action entails.     it is there-fore recommended that we accelerate ournove and withdraw, at any rate, to Shorgat, at once, and in. view of the small amount of money available and the consequent necessity for reducing our garrison, that thi. withdrawal be completed to Baghdad.A
A fresh situation, Involving a further reduction of the Iraq garrison has now to be envisaged.     Under the colonial office scheme for the control of the country by the R.A.P., the ground fighting unite will eventually consist of four battalions, one Pack Artillery Battery, and three Arjuoured Car Companies only.In view of this reduction, and of the long and vulnerable line of communication from Baghdad to Basrah, it is considered that a force at the former place would not be safe for any length of time.   It is, therefore, recommended that, by the time the garrison has reached its final size, a withdrawal to an area about Basrah should be oompleted.     such a scheme would protect the port of Basrah, safeguard the oil-field In the vicinity of Ahwaz, and enable us to keep control of the Persian Gulf, while the safety of the reduced garrison could be more easily secured.Appendix &quot;aw* Distribution of British Troops in Mosul vilayet on 1st January, 1922.Mosul.1 Indian Cavalry Regiment (less 1 squadron).1 Howitzer Battery R.F.A.
