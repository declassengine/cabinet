[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^&quot; Government. JPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1922,SECRET. XO.P. 3794. wCABINET.I circulate to my colleagues the following telegram which has been received relative to the Turkish question.E. S. M.3rd March 1922.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 1st March 1922.Secret. On the eve of the Graeco-Turkish Conference, we feel it our imperative duty to lay once more before His Majesty&apos;s Government the intensity of the feeling in India regarding necessity for a revision of the Treatyrof ,,Sevres.&apos; *sWe are fully alive to the complexity of the problem, and the conflict of interests that have to be considered. But India&apos;s .services in the Great War, and more especially in Mesopotamia and Palestine, where success was largely achieved by her army with its complement of Moslem soldiers, the vastness of her Moslem population, the intense stirring-up.of religious feeling over the Turkish question amongst it,; the,large degree of support the Indian Moslem cause is receiving from India at large, all these entitle her to claim utmost consideration of her aspirations and their fulfilment, in soriar as these are just, equitable, and reasonable. We are conscious that it may be impossible to satisfy India&apos;s expectations inlJieir entirely.Hut we urge upon Bis Majesty&apos;s Government three points which, due provision having been made for safeguarding the neutrality of the Straits and the security of the non-Turkish population, we ourselves regard.as essential !--i - first, evacuation, of Constantinople.Second, Snltan&apos;s suzerainty over the Holy Places.  &apos; vHw-!^Third, restoration of the Ottoman  Thrace, including sacred Moslem city of Adrianople, andHhe unreserved restoration-of Smyrna?We earnestly trust His Majesty&apos;s Government will give these aspirations all possible weight, for their fulfilment is, of the greatest importance, to,India.We think it: our duty to warn His Majesty&apos;s Governmen^tliat failure &quot;to allay Moslem -feeling, over.the revision of the Treaty will have dangerous results in India, and wilT intensify -bitterness and sullen&apos; resentment which has already led to &quot;serious disorder and bloodshed. Great, Rritain, as the greatest Povver in the Mohammedan world, &quot;canndt be less sympathetic towards Moslem &apos;&quot;feeling4, or^TesS ready fto&apos;&apos;take active,.steps on behalf of Islam, than the other Allies.Slie owes much of her influence in theJRast to;the-general&quot;recognition&apos;&apos;Hint sn&apos;e lias&apos; been champion of Islam amongst the Great Powers, and it is essential that she should not only retain this position, but also that there should be no room ibr &quot;doubt iuvthe minds of the public in India and elsewhere in the East on this subject.Above has the general concurrence of all LocaFGoverhfe^n^i^JlJr-ifcheir Ministers&apos; in India proper, excluding Burma, and including the frontier Provinces. Bengal Ministers in particular desire that we should impress on His Majesty&apos;s, Government unfortunate influence on Moslem opinion caused by prevalent impression that Great Britain has recently been less sympathetic towards Turkey than Prance. This strengthens us in urging that whatever influence His Majesty&apos;s Government may be pleased to exert on Turkey&apos;s behalf should be exerted openly, so that Great Britain may claim and win full credit for her attitude throughout Islam.&apos;&quot; So important is it for the Government of India to range itself openly on the side of Moslem India, that we press for permission to publish foregoing forthwith down to words &quot; greatest importance to India.&quot;5219100   3.22
