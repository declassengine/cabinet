GUARDIANSHIP OF IIE?ANTS BILL, (Reference Cabinet 88 (21), Conclusion 7)* Note by the Secretary to the Committee,The following Memorandum has &quot;been prepared by the Solicitor-General for the information of&apos; the Home Affairs Committee, who have been requested by the Cabinet to advise the Government on tho Guardianship of Infante Bill - a Private Members Bill * which was introduced in the House of Commons last Session, .-    A copy of the Bill is attached together with the Sections of the Act of George IV referred to in tho Solicitor-General&apos;s Memorandum.ICEIIORAlgUM BY THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL. .ausc 2. 1.        The most important change proposed in this Bill is that tho mother is made joint guardian, having joint custody of the infant, with the father, and is givon equal authority, rights, and responsibility with regard to the infant in every case.Under the existing law (except in case of misconduct or other exceptional circumstances). the father had sole jurisdiction over and custody of the child so long as both parents were alive, ause 4. 2. The Bill provides for the joint and several liability of.&quot;fej*&apos;h parents for tho coat of maintenance and education of the infant, according to their respective means.Under the existing lav; there is, except under the opera-tion of the poor law, no legal obligation on either parent in this respect, though the father may, if he wilfully neglects the child and allows it to become chargeable to the Union or
Parish, incur criminal liability, ause 5* 3. Whereas under the Act of 1886 (s*5) applicationcould be made to the Court by the motes.? with respect to the custody and right of access to tho infant, the Bill makes comprehensive provision for application, to the Court hy fat cor,, aether or other person on behalf, of the infant, a/id to enable the Court to make and enforce order3 not only as to custody and right of access, &quot;but also as to payments, to be made hy either the father or the mother to the mother or the father, whether the father and. mother are living together or not or to any other personhaving the custody, for the maintenance, education and henefit of the infant,4r        The Act of 1886 (s.,2) provides for tho guardianship .of the., motherafter the father&apos; s death, either alone or jointly with another guardian, appointed by the father or the Court, and for the appointment by the mother cf a guardian to act jointly with the father&apos;s appointee after the death of both parties (S.3(l)  ).     The Act also enabled the mother to nominate provisionally a guardian to act jointly with the father after her death, bat such nomination only became effective in the event of the father being shewn to be unfitted to act as gcole guardian (8,3.(2)  ) *It follows that under the existing law the mother possessed only a limited right in respect of the appointment of a guardian to act after her death.auso 6. The Bill places the parents on an equalityin this respect.     Bach parent is to have the right- 2 *
to appoint a guardian &quot;by deed or vn.ll to act as from his or nor death (or any Icier date) and such guardian is to act jointly with the surviving p&amp;yezito &quot;When no guardian 1b appointed the eurviving parent is sole guardian, tut the Ccu:;:t i-iay in this ease and also in the event of an appealed guardian having died or refusing to act, appoint a guardian to aot with the surviving parent *&quot;When &quot;both parents are dead tho guardians appointed hy the father and mother respectively act jointly.In the event of disagreement &quot;between the guardians (including parents) the Court decidesf &apos;..   thus following the Act of 1886, (S.3 (3) )oClause 10 (l) The Court is interpreted to mean in England.and Ireland the High Court of Justice, the Gsunty Court or the Court of Summary Jurisdiction of the district in which the respondent or respondents or any of them may reside.Clause 10 (2). Jurisdiction is conferred upon Courts of summary Jurisdiction to deal with all matters under the Bill where the infant in question has no property present or expectant, and at the request of &quot;both parties such cases can ho dealt with &quot;by the Juvsijls CourtsClause 12. An appeal is given from the Court to theChancery Division of the High Courts.The Bill is one that is asked for by the Women&apos;s Societies for the purpose of carrying out
tho &quot;pledge?&apos; to place &quot;both sexes upon an equality, and received general suppcrt in the House.     Wrecking anendcionts to it   vrere put So-m by Sir P. Banbury.   The cnena*nont3 suggested froin a number of quarters for tho purpose of improving the working of the Bill, are I understand accepted by its promoters and will be incorporated in the Bill when introduced in an amended foria.One serlaus co;:rplloation may be involved in the Bill if passed into Law;     that is as to the persons who would have power to assent to the marriage of minors in accordance with sects. 16 and 17 of 4, Geo. IV cap. 76, and also seat. 10 of 6 and 7 Will. IV. cap. 85.     I have received tho Memo, attached hereto from tho Registrar-General.        He explains that the point he refers to was lost sight of when the Act of 1886 was passed.     3!he title of the Bill would probably have to bo enlarged to enable the amendment that he proposes to be introduced.     i suggest that the Registrar-General should consult with the promoters of the Bill in order that the points involved, and left under the lav; a3 it at present stands in an unsatisfactory position^ may   -   if possible   -   be cleared up.       i understand that the promoters of the Bill are not unwilling to endeavour to $eet the views of the Begistrar-General.  :(fatd).   1,M.P.3 Dec 19SI.

(a) The court may, upon the application of any 5 father or mother who may apply without next friend) or other person on behalf of any legitimate infant, make such order as it may think just in accordance with this Act regarding (i) the custody of such infant and the right of access 10thereto by either parent or any other person ;(ii) any payment for the maintenance, education orbenefit of such infant by either the father or the mother to the mother or the father, whether father and mother are living together or not; or 15 to any other person having the custody ;(b) Where an infant is by an order of any court made under this Act removed from the care of any person and that person is entitled under any trust to receive any sum of money in respect of the maintenance of the said 20 infant, the court may order the whole or a,ny part of the sums so payable under the trust to he paid to the person to whose care the said infant is committed, to be applied by that person for the benefit of the said infant in such manner as having regard to the terms of the trust the 25 court may direct.(o) In making any such order as to custody and access the court shall have regard to the welfare of the infant and to the conduct and wishes of the parents.(d) In making any such order as to payment as 30 aforesaid by any such father or mother, the court shall have regard to the ability of such father or mother to make such payment, and to the position or condition of life in which, it is according to the means of such fatheror mother reasonable that such infant should be brought 35 up, and also to any property to which the infant is or may he entitled in its own right.

When no guardian has been appointed, the surviving parent shall he the sole guardian of such infant.

In any case where a decree for judicial separation, or a decree nisi or absolute for divorce, shall be pro- 40 nounced, the court pronouncing such decree may thereby declare the parent by reason of whose misconduct such decree is made to be a person unfit to have the custody
of the children (if any) of the marriage, and in such case a.D. 1921. the parent so declared to he unfit shall not upon the        death of the other parent he entitled as of right to the custody or guardianship of such children.5 Where the court has made an order under this section the court may subsequently, on due cause being shown, from time to time revoke, suspend or vary the order on the application of any person affected by the order.10.
