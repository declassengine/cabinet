[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]202Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1922.SECRET;REPLY TO ADMIRALTY MEMORANDUM (CP.-3700) ON RELATIONS BETWEEN THE NAVY AND THE AIR FORCE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.THE Admiralty have followed the example of the War Office and have made a renewed attack upon the principle of a separate air service.2. For the purpose of their argument, they attach to the First Lord&apos;s covering memorandum numerous documents, old and new, which seek to show that a separate air service is a mistake and a costly encumbrance. The Admiralty&apos;s conclusions are reached partly by the process of a complete reversal of their own statements of policy,* partly by the simple but hardly convincing method of disregarding all the arguments on the other side and of ignoring the conclusions of various independent committees and other bodies which have had before them at different times within the last few years the question of the formation or maintenance of a separate air service. I am, of course, prepared, if necessary, to restate the conclusions of these bodies, but think it is better to let their reports speak for themselves. I would refer in particular to (i.) Lord Curzon&apos;s Air Board Report, October 191.6.(ii.) Report of War Cabinet Committee on Air Organisation (General Smuts&apos;Committee), August 1917. (iii.) Conclusions of War Cabinet on establishment of a separate Air Force, August. 1917.3. Since the war, indeed within the last few months, the status and duties of the air service have been investigated by Mr. Balfour&apos;s Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, before which each of the three service depart-ments stated their views both in writing and orally. The conclusions of the Sub-Committee, as embodied in OLD.-149c, were a clear endorsement of the principle of a separate air service. I need not reiterate them here as they have been summarised in my answer to the Secretary of State for War&apos;s memorandum. In that answer I have also quoted the opinions expressed on financial grounds by the Geddes Committee on a separate air service. The opinion of the Committee was adopted in the face of memoranda submitted to it both by the War Office and the Admiralty on the theme of the &quot;costly and cumbersome&quot; nature of the present system.4. The various authorities to which I have referred are considerably more weighty for our purpose than foreign admirals of varying degrees of eminence, such as Admirals Fiske and Le Bon. As regards the latter, it is a matter of common knowledge that French naval aviation is in a primitive and undeveloped state. In any case the citation of purely naval authorities in other countries ignores the bias, which is as natural to American or French as to British admirals, against a new service with new methods.*1. &quot;Notes on Naval Policy&quot; appended to Navy Estimates, 1920/21 (cmd.. 619):-&quot;To remove all misconception it should be stated with emphasis that we. in no way contemplate a return to a separate naval air service. It is recognised that&apos; the Air Ministry was created by Parliament as a result of war experience to further development and maintenance of air power, and that to separate entirely from the Air Ministry that part dealing with the Navy would bo to retard progress and result in a weakening both in development of material and training of air personnel.&quot;2. Extract from letter from the Admiralty to the Air Ministry dated the 18th February, 1920:   &quot; Their Lordships wish to repeat the statement .... to the effect that they are desirous of assisting the Air Ministry to organise their future activities on a firm and durable basis, and further they wish to emphasise that they have no desire to establish a separate naval air service which the Air Council attribute to them.&quot;[78HS a]
5. The United States Aviation Mission which visited Europe after the war under the Assistant-Secretary of War reported strongly in favour of the British system, and recommended its adoption by the United States. The fact that this recommendation wras overruled is attributable rather to the strength of vested interests than to the merits of the case.6. What I have said in answer to the War Office paper in regard to the effects both upon policy and administration of this method of continuous attack against the Air Ministry, applies, of course, equally to the present attitude of the Admiralty. Unless and until the Admiralty are prepared loyally to co-operate with the Air Ministry in the public interest, it is, of course, impossible to obtain the best results.7. In conclusion I would in all seriousness warn the Government that the question of air defence is of vital importance to the security of this country, and that if we adopt the retrograde policy which is urged by the present senior officers of the Navy and Army, the possibilities of &quot; substitution &quot; will never receive adequate and dispassionate consideration, and the development of the means necessary to maintain our security will be seriously retarded.F. E. G.Air Ministry, February 11, 1922.
