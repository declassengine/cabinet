THXS, DOCUHEHT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.cEGRET. CABINET.07P.5785.ROAD CONVEYANCE OF GOODS BY RAILWAY COMPANIES.Memorandum for tlae. Cabinet by the Parliamentary Seoretary to the Ministry of Transport.1.       Under the Railways (North Western and Midland Group) Bill, 1922, power is sought by the London and North Western, the Midland, the Lancashire and Yorkshire and the Furness Railway Companies to provide, own, work and use in any district to whioh their system affords access, road vehicles and to convey therein merchandise and passengers and their luggage. Apart from Special Acts the general legal position appears to be that a Railway Company may run road services for the conveyance of merchandise and of passengers and their luggage, provided that the traffic in question has originated on the Ccmpanyfs line, or is destined for carriage on it but not otherwise.     The proposal contained in the Bill has excited acute opposition on the part of owners and users of mechanically propelled vehicles and traders and Local Authorities generally, and I desire the decision of the Cabinet as to the policy to be adopted when the Bill comes up for second reading.2.        The following are the arguments in favour of conferring upon Railway Companies the general powers sought by the Bill:-(a)     The competition of Independent road transport has withdrawn from the railways a considerable bulk of profitable traffic, and, irrespective of the loss thus caused to the Railway Companies, if the process continues, there is danger that the general public may be damnified by the Increase of rates and charges on the railways, the overhead expenses of which will have to be borne by a smaller quantity of traffic.
&quot;2 *R(b) It is alleged on behalf of the Railway Companies that existing taxation does not Impose upon inde-pendent road transport agencies a fair share of the costs of maintaining roads j   the road trans-port undertakings are thus subsidised out of the rates to which the Railway Companies are heavy contributors.(c) It would be an advantage to the general public and traders that the railways should be able to forward goods by a route alternative to the railway when, for example, oongested terminals or inter-mediate transhipment could be avoided.3.        Against the proposal contained in the Bill it is argued that the Railway Companios with their strong financial position and the advantages which they possess in their existing equipment and staffing, could run independent road transport undertakings off the road by undercutting their charges and could establish an effective if not a complete monopoly, which would put them in a position either to withdraw their road services altogether ana force traffic on to their railways or to increase their charges to the detriment of the public.4.        Early in 1921 Sir Erie Geddes appointed a - Committee consisting of an independent Chairman, the late Mr. Jo Balfour Browne, K.C*., with two representatives each of Traders, Hallway Companies, owners and users of mechanically propelled vehicles, and Labour to enquire into the general question.     The result of this Committee was three separate reports which have been presented to Parliament, Cmd. 1228. The Chairman and the railway representa-Ives recommended that powers should be given to the Railway Companies restricted (l) by the Traffic Acts (1*3* provision of
reasonable facilities and prohibition of undue preference (2) by a clause similar to Section 9 of the Ministry of Transport Act (separate accounts of the road transport service to be rendered and expenses to be borne by the revenue of the service) and (3) by the control of charges by the Minister of Transport.     The Road Transport and the Traders representatives signed a report opposing the grant of any such powers to railway companies while one of the Labour representatives signed a report In favour of the nationalisation of transport generally.5.     It is necessary to consider whether It is possible to devise such safeguards as will, while enabling the railway companies to secure the powers which they seek, provide against the establishment of an oppressive monopoly either by the Railway Companies alone or by the Railway Companies in combination with the larger road transport interests.6.     The following safeguards already exist:-(a)   Natural or economic.     Even if the Railway Companies succeeded In establishing an effective monopoly-it would not be possible for them either to withdraw their road services or to increase their charges excessively. The fate of Canals which the Railway Companies are alleged to have killed, does not afford a fair parallel even if the allegation is well founded.     The provision or re-starting of a Canal requires a much larger outlay of capital than is required to start a road transport service. There would always be a number of firms owning road vehicles who would be able rapidly to expand and run services or undercut the Railway Companies if the Railway Companies withdrew their services er excessively Increased their charges.     Purthermore, new road undertakings could be brought into operation quite quickly.
(b)     Artiflcial or legislative.     Under Section 58 (4) of the Railways Act the Rates Tribunal, when fixing the charges necessary to produce the standard revenue for each company is required to proceed on the assumption that adequate charges are in operation fer all ancillary- businesses carried on by the Railway Company.     The effect of this Section would be that, if a Railway Company so cut its charges for road transport as to mak9 the road services not self-supporting it could net re-coup itself out of the earnings of its railway, without reducing its net revenue.The value of this safeguard depends partly on the speed with which It can be applied, partly on the extent to which it is practicable to ascertain the true financial position of an ancillary business by the requirement of separate accounts,  and partly on the interpretation placed by the tribunal or the Courts on the phrase &quot;adequate charges&quot;. With reference to the last point it is conceived that the charges could not be regarded as adequate unless these were ) sufficient with due care and management to provide, in addition to working expenses and depreciation, a reasonable return on the capital.     A Railway Company is however usually in a position to raise capital at a lower rate than the ordinary private haulier.To make this safeguard as fully effective as possible it would be necessary for the Minister to have power to prescribe statutory forms of account and to control their compilation and to require special returns and statistics, as might be necessary, on the lines of the Railway Companies (Accounts and Returns) Act, 1911, and Section 77 of the Railways Act, 1921.7.     The following safeguards are contained In the Bill:-
(a) The Bill provides that the Company may demand and take such reasonable rates and charges as they think fit in respect of traffic, and that the provisions of Part III of the Railways Act, 1921, shall, so far as they are applicable, apply to such rates and charges.     The effect of this Clause la not completely clear.     It appears to mean that charges would is*e*6 be fixed by the Railway Company subject to the right of Traders to appeal to tho Rates Tribunal against them aa unreasonable, but the Companies are understood to be&apos; anxious to placate opposition and would probably apply specifically the principle of fixed standard charges settled by the Rates Tribunal.     Though the Rates Tribunal Is charged with the duty of reviewing the reasonableness of the charges of a railway company for collection and delivery and the proposal contained in the Bill would be to extend this to general road services, it is oontrary to the policy of the Railways Act to impose upon the Rates Tribunal the duty of fixing the charges for any other ancillary services, e.g. hotels, steamboats, and docks.(b) The Bill further provides that the Railway and Canal Traffic Acts, 1854 to 1894, In so far as they relate to reasonable facilities and undue preference, shall apply to the road traffic.     These provisions with regard to reasonable facilities would be ineffective and the safeguard Is Illusory.(c) The Bill further provides that the Company shall provide in their form of accounts furnished under the Railway Companies Accounts and Returns Act, 1911, an abstract of revenue and expenditure in respect of traffic conveyed under the powers which they seek.     The Accounts and Returns which would be required have been dealt with in paragraph 6 (b) of this memorandum.
8*     Speaking generally I think that though none of these proposals embodies a complete safeguard against abuse, their cumulative effect would be to give considerable protection to the trader, the road transport undertaking, and the general publico     I think that when the Bill comes up for second reading a speech should be made by a Government representative recognising (a) the fears of the traders, of owners and users of mechanically propel3.ed vehicles; and of Local Authorities, (b) the difficulty of deciding on the principle of the Bill until a Committee had considered in detail the safeguards which could be devised to prevent the growth of an cppresive monopoly, and (c) recommending the House to send the Bill to Committee exprec3ly reserving the decision of the Government until third reading,(Signed)    ARTHUR MEAL.tiinistry of Transport. 28th February, 1922.
