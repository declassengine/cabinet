[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majeitys Goverhm^ 1Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1922.SECRET.C.P.-3760.CABINET.THE ANGLO-FRENCH AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THERE have been circulated to the Cabinet at different times in the last few weeks, both the French Draft Pact in its latest form and a number of explanatory notes by or from the French Government on the subject. These, cuhniuated in a lengthy French memorandum dated the 1st February (an English translation of which has also been circulated) repeating and summarising the arguments previously advanced. This must be regarded as the final and reasoned exposition of the French views, and it is the document which sooner or later I must answer. I desire to consult the Cabinet as to the form of reply.The French draft treaty-commenced with a Preamble of five clauses, which, except in one particular, is identical with the draft Preamble of the original British draft put forward by us, and accepted by M. Briand, at Cannes.The exception is the introduction of reciprocity into the 4th clause. The original British draft ran thus : &quot; Whereas guarantees of the security of France against any future invasion by Germany are indispensable to the restoration of European stability, the safety of Great Britain, and the peace of the world ; &quot;The French draft runs as follows : &quot; Whereas reciprocal guarantees against a future aggression by Germany are indispensable to the restoration - of European stability, the safety of France and Great Britain, and the peace of the world; &quot;The decision whether reciprocity shall be admitted in the Preamble depends upon our acceptance or the reverse of Article 1 of the Pact itself, which raises the question in a more direct form.Article 1 of the British draft ran thus : &quot; In the event of direct and unprovoked aggression against the soil of France by Germany, Great Britain will come to the immediate assistance of France with her naval, military and air forces.&quot;On the other hand, Article 1 of the French draft runs as follows&quot;In the event of an unprovoked aggression by Germany against France, Great Britain will place herself immediately at the side of France with her naval, military and air forces.&quot; Reciprocally in the case of an unprovoked aggression by Germany against Great Britain, France will place herself immediately at the side of Great Britain with her military, naval and air forces.&quot;It will be observed that the differences between the French and British drafts are three in number.The most important of these is the introduction of the reciprocity clause. M. poincare explains and justifies this on three grounds : (a.) The necessity of demonstrating clearly to Germany the solidarity of our two countries in the event of a German aggression against either.(b.) The amour-propre of France, demanding that the two countries shall he placed on a footing of equality.(c.) The possibility that with the development of air attack, Great Britain may be as much exposed as France to German attacks in the future. Of these reasons the second is, doubtless, in the French mind the more important. But the third is not without force. I recommend that as such a clause can do no possible harm, is demanded by the self-respect of France, and may conceivably be &apos;of future advantage to ourselves, we should agree to it. This decision will carry with it the amendment of the Preamble previously referred to.745   [7888]   [7900] B
The second and third alterations are that the French propose to omit the word &quot; direct&quot; before &quot; attack,&quot; and to substitute &quot;France&quot; for &quot;the soil of France.&quot;At least ! assume that M. Poincare desires to make the former omission, because his argument is directed to that point, although in the text as forwarded by him the adjective &quot; direct&quot; has slipped back into its place.His argument for both these changes is this. He thinks that the British formula would dangerously restrict the conditions in which British help would be given. The cams fcederis would only arise, under our terms, if French territory were actually and directly invaded, whereas German aggression might equally and at an earlier stage be involved by a declaration of war, an ultimatum, or a concentration of forces marching towards the frontier..1 do not say that the French arguments are without force. But at the same time 1 am indisposed to yield to them for the following reasons(a.) I am clear in my own mind that in so far as British public opinion Avill endorse our guarantee, it will be in the belief that it can only become operative in the event of a German army actually crossing the French frontier and invading French soil.(h.) Tf wre envisage British action at an earlier stage, I foresee serious and even clangorous disputes as to wdiat constitutes an act of aggression, and at what stage mobilisation or concentration or advance develops into attack. We remember howr, in the early days of August 1914, it was the Russian decree of mobilisation that was regarded by the German Government as tantamount, to a declaration of war.(c.) I rather mistrust the substitution of the word &quot; France &quot; for the words &quot; the soil or territory of France.&quot; .M. Poincare argues that aggression can take place by sea or air as easily as by land. This is true. But the attack is equally against the territory of a country in all three cases. What I fear about the more general phrase is that a future French Government might claim a good many things as constituting an aggression against France (e.g., an attack by a German force upon a French colony) which were not an aggression upon the soil of France. Other cases can also be imagined.I am therefore disposed, in respect of both these proposals, to adhere to our original text.I now come to a much more serious suggestion.   Our Article 2 ran thus : &quot;The High Contracting Parties reassert their common interest in Articles 42, 43 and 44 of the Treaty of &quot;Versailles, and will consult together should any breach of them be threatened or any doubt arise as to their interpretation.&quot;The French Article 2 is as follows :-&quot; The two high contracting parties reaffirm their common interest in Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Peace of Versailles. They agree, in conformity with Article 44 of the said treaty, to consider any violation whatever by Germany of the said Articles as constituting an act of aggression against France and Great Britain.&quot; They will concert together in the event of any threat of violation of the said Articles, or of any doubt arising as to their interpretation, as well as in the event of any military, naval or air measures imcompatible with the Treaty of Versailles being taken by Germany.&quot;M. Poincare&apos;s argument in favour of this very important change is as follows. He observes that the French Government highly appreciate the fact that the British Government realise that the above Articles of the Peace Treaty may not in themselves be sufficient to maintain peace ; but the British draft providing that the two Powers should consult together in the event of a violation of those articles contains an important lacuna. This lacuna the French Government desire to fill by stating in the Pact that any violation of Articles 42 and 43 by Germany will in itself constitute the aggression contemplated by Article 1 of the Pact. In other words, if Germany violates Articles 42 and -3 3 it will not be a matter for consultation: it will automatically mean war. *a
IM. Poincare states that there seoms to be some misapprehension in Londot regard to this proposal, and he proceeds to explain what the French Government in by giving three instances : (a.) Germany demands the authorisation of the Allied Powers to introduce police forces into the area in order to suppress riots. In this event there is neither violation nor threat of violation. If the authorisation is given, the question does not arise. If the Allies. refuse their authorisation and Germany shows the intention to continue, there is then a threat of violation and, in conformity with clause 2 of the French Article 2, France and England will consult together. If Germany does continue, there is an evident open aggression and the easus fcederis arises.(6.) France and England learn that Germany contemplates violating Articles 42 and 43, since the Reichstag have voted funds for the construction of fortresses in the area and unusual numbers of troops are assembled in proximity to the area in circumstances which give rise to the belief that Germany intends to introduce them into the area. In this instance there is no violation of Articles 42 and 43 and. consequently no aggression ; the casus fcederis, therefore, does not arise. On the other hand, there is a threat of violation and, in accordance with ciaus3 2 of the French Article 2, the French and British Governments consult together.(c.) Germany deliberately violates Articles 42 and 43 by introducing police forces into the area without the authorisation of the Allies, or by introducing into the area forces in greater numbers than those authorised. This deliberate violation constitutes a hostile act in the terms of Article 44. The French Government are justified in asking that such violation should constitute an aggression, or they will find themselves exposed to seeing French territory invaded, since the protection assured by the treaty will no longer exist.The area to which Articles 4-2 and 44 of the Peace Treaty refer is at present in Allied occupation. Under Articles 428-432 of the Peace Treaty it will remain in Allied occupation for a period of fifteen years from the date of the treaty, but if the conditions of the treaty are faithfully carried out by Germany the occupation will be successively restricted as the years go by. If, however, the guarantees against unprovoked aggression by Germany are not considered sufficient by the Allied Governments, and if the Reparation Commission finds that Germany refuses to observe the whole or part of her obligations with regard to reparations, the evacuation of the occupied troops may be delayed, or such part of the area as has been evacuated reoccupied.Of course, if the duration of the Fact were confined to ten years the British obligation would be practically nil. But if we agree to extend it to fifteen or twenty years, and still more if its duration be then prolonged by mutual consent, the proposed obligation would assume a very different complexion. Who could say at what point or stage or in what exact measure the appearance of a German force or the building of a German gun emplacement in the area in question ought to constitute a casus belli ? It is easy to foresee endless difficulties and causes of dispute.But my objections are even more fundamental.In the first place, I do not believe that British public opinion will for a moment stand the treatment of the Cis-Rhenish territory as though it were a part of the soil of France, or that they will consent to go to war automatically for its defence if it were assailed. I do not say that on an appreciation of the circumstances of the case, if and when it arose, they might not both be willing and be bound to do so. But they would not accept in advance an obligation so formidable and so ill-defined.And there is a further-reason for their refusal, viz., that in Article 44 of the Treaty of Versailles the violation of this territory is expressly described as a hostile act, not against France or Great Britain alone or even particularly, but against all &quot; the Powers signatory of the present treaty,&quot; from which it follows that the obligation of defending the treaty and of punishing its violation is one that belongs to all the signatory Powers, and cannot properly be appropriated by two of their number.Accordingly, this plan of superseding the Powers and overriding the treaty appears to me to be unsound and indefensible. I might add a third consideration, namely, that a military alliance of this description between Great Britain and France could only result in rival and, it might be, hostile combinations between other Powers (conceivably even between Germany and Russia), and that it is entirely[7888] B 2
insistent with the theory upon which it has hitherto been assumed that the it-war polity of Europe is to lie based. The second part, of (lie Trench&quot; draft of Article 2 is intended to take the place of the second part of our draft of the same Article. The British words were :  &quot; Will consul! together, should any breach of them (i.e., Articles 42, -13 and 44) he threatened or any doubt arise as to their interpretation.&quot;The French, words are : &quot; Will concert together in the event of any threat of violation of the said Articles or of any doubt arising as to their interpretation.&quot;These words may, T think, be accepted.The French draft then goes on to incorporate in the same Article the undertaking which was contained in bur Article 3, with the difference that the words &quot; naval &quot; and ,:air&quot; are added to the word &quot;military,&quot; the French draft accordingly running as follows (after the words above quoted) : &quot; As well as in the event of any military, naval or air measures incompatible with the Treaty of Versailles being taken by Germany.&quot; -This may be accepted.I now come to the proposed newArticle about-consultation between the two General Staffs.   This is the French draft:  &quot; Constant and friendly intercourse will be maintained between the respective general staffs of the two high contracting parties with the view of ensuring the eventual efficacy of the foregoing dispositions.&quot;M. Poincare argues at great length in favour of his proposal, on the ground that the Anglo-French Agreement will only be taken seriously by Germany if she knows that the requisite dispositions have been settled in advance. He recalls that during the years preceding the war such an entente between the British and French Staffs existed, and he points out that if such a state of thing existed when the co-operation of the two Governments was optional and uncertain, it can surely be allowed&quot; when the two Governments have pledged themselves to co-operate. Otherwise France would be in a worse position than she was before the war. It is inconceivable, he says, that the conclusion of an alliance between France and Great Britain should result in the termination of the close relations now existing between the two Staffs and should compel them in the event of war to improvise the conditions of military co-operation. He is careful to point out that the French Government are perfectly aware that British military forces in times of peace do not correspond with the immense forces which, she can furnish in war time. There is no question of fixing in a definite manner in a military convention the number and nature of the units available, but of taking into account by constant communication between the two Staffs the forces which would, if the case arises, be available for the common defence. Such an entente is all the more necessary as probably the two Staffs will have to contemplate not only Anglo-French co-operation, but also that of the Belgian army, in view of the military convention already concluded by France with Belgium and the Anglo-Belgian Pact which the British Government are now negotiating. If, however, the British Government prefer not to insert such a provision in the text of the treaty itself, the French Government would be ready to agree that such a provision should figure in notes annexed to the treaty, which would be signed and published at the same time as the latter.M. Poincare in the course of his argument.alludes to the exchange of notes between Sir E. Grey and M. Cambon in 1912. As a matter of fact, the entente between the two Staffs really dates from 1906, just before the Algeciras Conference. There was no written agreement, but the military and naval experts of the two Governments were authorised to enter into confidential conversations as to the manner in which the two countries might give each other support in the case of a joint war, &quot; on the distinct understanding that nothing which passed between the military or naval experts should bind either Government or restrict in any way their freedom to make a decision as to whether or not they would give that support when the time arose.&quot; (See statement by Sir E. Grey in the House of Commons, 3rd August, 1914.)
I do not imagine that there can be any objection to such confidential eon versatile in the future any more than in the past.   On the contrary, they will probably be ve useful in order to keep ourselves acquainted with the military programme or auihitio; of France.   The question is whether it is necessary to provide for this intercoms either by a special Article in the treaty or by an exchange of notes to be appended to the treaty and published with it.I am opposed to either course. In conversation with me the French Ambassador defended, the proposal of his Government because of the terrifying effect it would have upon the Germans. I cannot see that it would make the smallest difference to them. When our two General Staffs meet the Germans will be aware of the fact, whether the meeting is provided for in a treaty or not.Upon the other hand, I do see a positive objection to the insertion of such a provision in the treaty. It will lead to the impression, and almost certainly to the demand, put forward by the soldiers that each country shall maintain a certain proportion of forces, to be provided or utilised in a particular way. It will convey the idea, in a more concrete form than it would be prudent or safe to admit, of a military obligation the definition of which will rest, not with Oabiiiets or Parliaments, but with the General Staffs. It will take the agreement out of the political sphere and transfer it across the military frontier. I cannot help thinking that this would be disadvantageous both in the hopes and in the fears that it might arouse.I now come to a new Article (IV in the French draft), which runs as follows : &quot; The Government of the French Republic and the Government of His Britannic Majesty agree to concert together on all questions of a nature to endanger the peace or to jeopardise the general order of things set up under the treaties of peace of which they are signatories. They will examine in common the measures necessary to ensure speedily a peaceful and equitable settlement.&quot;At first sight this clause seems to embody a quite innocent proposition. But it must be read in the light both of its history and of its real significance. It is the heir, or rather the substitute, of the proposal put forward by the French Ambassador in his first conversations with me last year, that the Anglo-French Agreement should apply in some undefined way to the frontiers of Poland and other Fast European States which are regarded by the French as the outer frontier of their country. That proposal was unhesitatingly turned down both by myself at that time and by the Prime Minister in his conversations with M. Briand at Cannes. Now we have a vaguer and more diluted formula, which M. Poincare thus explains.He observes with truth that the English draft aims only at preventing a direct aggression by Germany. The French Government want to go further and to consolidate peace by establishing on a solid foundation a lasting union between France and England, So long as there is hope of dividing our two countries, peace will not be assured. Certainly France and England hold different views on various international problems ; but if they engage to consult together when those problems become acute such consultation will surely lead to a solution of the difficulties.M. Poincare goes on to deal with the criticism which will almost certainly be made against the Pact that it supplants the League of Nations, and that England and France are between them undertaking duties which fall properly to the League. The French thesis, which was elaborated in greater detail in the Cointe de Saint-Aulaire&apos;s memoranda, is that no general entente, whether it take the form of the League of Nations or any other shape, can be really effective unless England and France are in close accord. The temptation to certain Powers included in a general entente to exploit differences between France and England must be removed. England and Prance should form an inner nucleus of the League of Nations and afford the strong support of Allied military backing when necessary in those cases which are covered by the Pact.My view of these arguments is as follows : It might, of course, be said that nothing but good could come from an engagement to consult with the French and concert measures to be taken in common with them on all questions likely to endanger peace. It has been one of our chief grievances against them in the case of the occupation of the five German towns and of the Franklin-Bouillon Agreement that they acted behind our backs. Nevertheless the obligation to consult together and decide on common action in the event of peace being threatened is one which, under the covenant, is imposed on all the members of the League ; and Article 4 of the French draft as it stands at present will undoubtedly be attacked by ardent partisans of the covenant as an affront to the League.
Apart, from tliis, the formula suggested, whether it be incorporated in the treaty I annexed to it (as suggested by the French), appears to me to take us further rward in the direction of an Anglo-French alliance than I believe we are prepared to &apos;.   If General Smuts&apos; apprehensions are so seriously aroused at a mere guarantee of- e frontier, what won id he not say at this wide and indefinite extension of our responsibilities ?It must further be observed that the new obligation is not confined to the maintenance of the Treaty of Versailles, but to all the treaties of peace of which France and Great Britain are signatories. In other words, if there is trouble on the Bulgarian frontier or at Budapest, or, it may be later, at Constantinople, the two Powers, nut, waiting for anyone else, are &quot;to examine in common the measures necessary to ensure speedily a peaceful and equitable settlement.&quot; Of course, this might mean that they would jointly refer the case to the League of Nations. But, if so, the provision is unnecessary. On the other hand, it could be taken to mean, and is probably intended by the French to mean, that the settlement of future European disputes is a matter primarily for Great Britain and France, and that the rest of the world is to look on until our two Governments have made up their minds what they will do. This might prove a very powerful and effective form of European hegemony. But I do not think either that we want it or that the rest of Europe would stand it.For instance, while I read the French proposals I find myself constantly saying: But what of Italy ? What will the Italians say ? Now Italy, though she may not be a very stable or reliable element, is nevertheless one of the great trinity of European Powers, a by no means negligible factor, and a factor which in spite of its tempera-mental instability is on the whole inclined towards the British side. If Italy found herself thus pushed into the background she could not but resent it, and her opportunities for dangerous intrigue would be indefinitely multiplied.Article 5 of the French draft, exempting the British Dominions, is identical with the same Article in the British draft and calls for no comment.Article 6 proposes to extend the duration of the Pact from ten years to thirty, renewable (as in our draft) by common agreement at the end of that period.M. Poincare&apos;s argument is as follows.   He points out that 1. At the end of ten years the demilitarised area under Articles 42 and 43 of the Peace Treaty wull still be in Allied occupation, thus rendering any German aggression impossible.2. Germany may hope that at the end of ten yearn the Pact will not be renewed, and the Nationalist Party may promote the idea of a war of revenge against France at that moment.3. Germany will be more redoubtable in ten years&apos; time than she is at present. For these reasons the Anglo-American Guarantee Treaty had no time limit. The French Government urge that the object they have in view, namely, the affirmation of the solidarity of the two Governments and their determination to remain united is incompatible with a time limit.M. Poincare does not raise a point made in one of the explanatory memoranda communicated to me by the Comte de Saint-Aulaire, i.e., that a duration of ten years would coincide with that of the naval holiday, and that Great Britain has every interest in maintaining beyond the duration of the naval holiday the agreement with France which will react on naval armaments.The French Government thought at first that it would be suitable to fix the time limit at thirty years. If, however, the British Government find this period too long it might they say be fixed at twenty years on the distinct and written understanding that the Pact will be renewable by common agreement.Whilst British public opinion would almost certainly be hostile to tying our hands for thirty years, it must be admitted that from the French point of view ten years is too short. If danger from Germany arises for the French it wall arise for us too, and we shall not be able to afford to see France crushed in 1932 any more than we could in 1914. I think, therefore, that we can afford to meet the French on this point by an extension either to fifteen or even to twenty years.The Cabinet will have seen from the report of a recent conversation of mine with the Belgian Ambassador that upon the answer to many of the questions which I have here discussed will depend the form of the Anglo-Belgian Agreement, which it is proposed to conclude, either independently or at the same time. The Belgians will do what we wish in respect of all the disputed points, being very anxious to get their agreement as a set-off against the often uncomfortable predominance that France claims to exercise in Belgium.
There remains a question of very great and capital importance, viz., whether the Anglo-French Fact should be concluded independently and on its own merits before we have arrived at a common understanding with France upon the most urgent of the questions on which we now differ or a settlement of which by mutual accord is still delayed. When the Prime Minister first discussed the plan of. an Agreement with M. Briand at Cannes lie very clearly indicated that its conclusion must be dependent &quot;upon a satisfactory solution of these difficulties, whether they related to the Near East, the Genoa Conference, or the question of submarines. M. Briand did not contest this condition. But it has ever since been sharply criticised in France, as implying a bargain, which was wounding to the susceptibilities of a great Allied nation, and there are mischief-makers in this country (vide the &quot; Times&quot; of the 16th February) who take the same view.Believing as I do that, in the last resort, the life of M. Poincare&apos;s Ministry will depend upon the conclusion of the Pact with England in some form, I think it would be unwise on our part to abandon the very powerful form of pressure which its non-conclusion enables us to exercise. Without definitely stating that we can only sign it when we have been satisfied on this or that point, I would, nevertheless, make it the concluding, rather than the opening or middle stage in our negotiations, and would find excellent reasons for prolonging the discussion upon it until we are nearer a friendly solution of the many difficult problems by which we are still confronted.C. of K.February 17, 1922.
