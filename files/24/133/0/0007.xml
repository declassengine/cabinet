HIS DOCUhBNT IS. THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.) - - - J&apos; E C. R E T   . 5707.&apos;    &apos; CABINET.BILL TO AMEND- THE NAVAL DISCIPLINE ACT .(keraorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty)In the absence of the First Lord in America I beg leave to request that the attached Bill may be circulated to the Cabinet *The two matters dealt with by the Bill which are really important are Section 4, as to the discipline of Royal Naval Personnel lent to or serving in Dominion Naval Ships or-Establishments , and Section 5, compulsory deductions from pay of Naval ratings for maintenance of wife and children or Illegitimate children.As regards the former of these two clauses the Admiralty has endeavoured to carry, on without this provision which has long ago received the concurrence of the Self-governing D&amp;ninions; and Canada at any rate h;as grown Impatient, not to say acrimonious, owing to the failure to get through what we agreed upon so long ago.   They not unnaturally feel resentment over the fact that while the Admiralty makes a convenience of their Naval Establishment at Halifax for the accommodation of Naval ratings changing ships there, to and from Bermuda, they have no power over such ratings awaiting passage until this Bill is passed.As regards Section 5,-maintenance of children, etc., the present rates In the relevant section of the Act are, if not quite pre-war, at any rate out of date, and the section drafted also contains a compromise clause restricting local authorities in the manner in which they may recover arrears of maintenance from a seaman or ex-seaman of the Navy.   This particular clause has been enacted in the 1921 Annual Army and Air Force Act.The other points dealt with in the Bill are(1) Amendments necessary to include the rank of Lieutenant-C ornmander.(2)    Power is taken to adjourn Courts Martial for a period not exceeding six days.(3)    A small alteration in the definition of &quot;Officer&quot;.Warrant Officers, RjM. used not to rank as Officers. Now Warrant Officers R.h. Class&quot;&quot;! rank as Officers j Warrant Officers Class III     (a moribund class) do not.IThe whole of the proposed Bill may safely, I think, be regarded as non-contentious .With respect to Section 6,  (printing clause), this enables the main Naval Discipline Act to be officially reprinted as amended by the present Bill.    In previous Naval Discipline Bills this clause has. not itself been incorporated with the main Act, I     but has remained outstanding in the amending Act.    It is now proposed to adopt the more convenient course of incorporating it in the main Act so that in future amending Bills it will not he. necessary.! I (Si gne d)  L . S .
