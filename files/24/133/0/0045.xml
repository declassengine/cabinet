HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS B . IT ANN 10  MAJESTY&apos;&quot; S GOVERNMENT,?,P,3744.0 A B I N g T , EMPLOYMENT OP CHILDREN ACT, 19051 AMEND.&quot; TEN memorandum   BY   THE   SECRETARY   POR   SCOTLAND.;The Eduoatlon (Scotland) Act, IS]8. attended the Employment of Children Act, 1903; so far as it r-elati to Scotland, &quot;by the following provision -&quot;No child or young person under the age cf 17 shall he employed in street trading&quot;0 It was, I believe, the intention of Parliament to pre -hibit all street trading by all such persona, but- it has &quot;been judicially decided that the enactment dees not apply to children or young persons who engage in street, trading without being employed by other persons0    My attention has been called by Societies interested in the welfare of juveniles to the unfortunate results of this decision, and. I agree with them that there is no reason for making any distinction between children employed and children trading on their own accounto    I would propose, therefore, that the law should be amended by the addition to the words quoted above of the words &quot;nor shall any such child or young person engage in street trading&quot;;    and by the provision of a penalty in the case of contraventions0I should be glad to have authority to introduce a Bill for this Ariose,Scottish Office,15th February, 1922.
