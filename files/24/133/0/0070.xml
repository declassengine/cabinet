ifCABINET  .L.G-. 64.BEG IS Li .T I OK POK THE COkING SSSSIOI:. Memorandum by the Minister of Health. .I have had under consideration the question of legislation for next Session so far as it affects my Department and I should be glad to have the authority of the Home Affairs Committee fcr&apos;the introduction of the following Bills:-1. Housing,   a Bill to amend .Section 15 of the Housing,&apos; Town Planning etc, Act, 1919, y/ith regard to the conditions of sale .of houses. -2. National,Health. Insurance. A Bill to provide for increase of contributions and other matters.3. Alkali V;orks.     A Bill to provide for the payment &apos;of increased fees under the Alkali Acts.&apos;  (These three Bills are required to give effect to  , recommendations of the Geddes Committee).4.&apos; Audit.     A Bill to substitute &apos;annual&apos; for Thalf-yearly1 audits in the cases of rural district councils, guardians, and overseers.     This Bill, though not suggested by.the Geddes Committee, might be considered to be an &quot;economy&quot; Bill.     The proposed alteration in the law has been strongly pressed for by the authorities concerned and would obviously save them expense.     As re gar Is the central department some expense of administration would be saved but this would have no effect upon the Exchequer as the cost of audit is now covered by stamp duty.
In the event of this Bill being introduced it is further suggested that the opportunity s-nould be taken to empower town councils, 11 they, so desire, to have their accounts made subject to Government audit.This E-:ill would be in the interests o..&quot;&apos; economy and would probably be non-contentious.5. Milk.    It is essential that some Bill dealing with milk should be passed before next August, otherwise the Act of 1915 would automatically corne into force, involving additional expenditure and the appointment of additional officials by the local authorities.     There are two alternatives.     One is to introduce a Bill merely postponing the date on which the 1915 Act is to come into operation.     The other is to repeal the 1915 Act and to seek such powers only as will not involve additional expenditure.6. Valuation and Rating Reform.   The report of the Valuation and Rating Reform Committee (CP.5544) is no:.- befcie the Home Affairs Committee.     A Bill giving effect to the re commend tions of the Committee would be a Bill of great,.If not of the first, importance.     Certain vested interests would be affected and it is unlikely that the Bill would be uncon-troverslal, but I am sure that it -.,111 receive a large measure of support, and I hope that at any rate it may be possible to introduce the Bill and have it read a second time In, the coming, session.7. Rating; of Machinery.    The Chambers of Commerce have asked for the introduction of legislation on this subject and I have circulated a Memorandum (C,P.3563) on this question.     The Bill&apos;would probably be opposed by the agricultural interests and possibly other sections of ratepayers, but it would be
strongly supported by the manufacturers and would at least do something to assist industry.8.. hent Restrict!on...     Urgent representations have been made to me to amend the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920, in order to protect landlords who, through a purely technical omission to serve a notice to quit, are now liable to repay to their tenants the increases of rent permitted under the 1920 Act.     The case for amending legislation is supported not only by the Property Owners but also by the chief tenants Organisation, and on grounds of equity the case for amendment is very strong.     I am circulating a memorandum dealing more fully with this question.9. Housing Consolidation Bill.     A consolidation of the Housing Acts has been asked for in both Houses of Parliament and the Government have given provisional undertakings to introduce such a Bill when practicable.     As a large amount of work has been done on this Bill and the    draft is approaching completion I suggest that the Bill should be introduced in the House of Lords, in which case it would, in accordance tilth the usual procedure, be referred to the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills.1q.t National Health Insurance (Consolidation) Bill.      In this case again strong representations have been made both inside and outside Parliament as to the necessity of a Oon-solidation Bill.     The work has been taken in hand and it would be possible to introduce the Bill at an-early date but for two complications. . The first is the proposal, referred to above, with regard to the amendment of the Insurance Acts which is required to give effect to the recommendations of
the Geddes Committee.-     This is not a very serious matter, as it would probably be regarded- by Parliament as convenient that, the two Bills should be introduced simultaneously that tae amending Bill should be passed first, and trjat the consequential amendments should then be made in the Consolidation Bill. The position, however * in regard to the transfer of powers to the Irish Governments will probably mean that the intro-duction of the Consolidation Bill must be delayed until the amendments in the Insurance Acts necessitated by the transfer have been settled-.In addition to the above measures I may find It necessary at a later date to ask for authority to introduce some other bills dealing with such questions, for example, as (a) defaulting Boards of Guardians and other local authorities, (b) the increase of fees payable for the regis-tration of births, marriages and deaths, and other matters connected therewith, (c) the powers of a Public Health Committee of a local authority to take over the control of School Medical service, and (d) the treatment of Incipient Mental disease.A. MOND. 31st January, 1922.Ministry of Health.
