Copy cf telegram, from Yioeroy io secretary of State for India, KOoil.3 of 24th January,,. 1922,First Pgrm-.Reference paragraph 7 of my Army Department telegram 43 dated 11th January.,     following is aumroary of rocommenda-tion of the Committee appointed by Commander-in-Chief underchairmanship of the Chief of the General Staff to prepare&apos; scheme for Indianisation of the Indian Army?     Copies of the Be port sent you by mail of 21st January,Committee reject Cobbe&apos;s scheme on the grounds that (? it would)&apos; establish (? formation) surplus to minimum military&apos; requirements of India and unfit for service in the yieldr and that India could not afford this extra military charge.-    Moreover, Indian public opinion would not accept such scheme as proposed [? as - oirltted) earnest of&apos; our intention to Indian is a the Army.    They ^con-aider it essential that in early stage of the scheme ( each) unit undergoing Indianisation shall be member of group of other units officered as, at present, thus ensuring maln-tenance of the existing high standards and traditions, and that junior Indian officers shall serve in units under British officers,,from whom they can learn: discipline and principles&apos; of- leadership and command..     These conditions would not.-:-be fulfilled under Oobbe&apos;s scheme .     Committee are opposed to; &quot;proposals- for grant of Dominion commissions for the reasons--given in part 3 &quot;below.&apos;

Indians in &apos;7 cavalry regiments, 20 infantry battalion;:;,6.-pioneer battalions, 6 pack batteries. 1 hoac-.ri.ua.rt.srcs-company of&quot; Engineers; 6 field companies,,  2 field troops, 1 railway company of Engineers.     Bstablishment of officers of Indian units to. to approximately same ao that of British officers of British raits..    Totsi. Indian Officers re.cuired for combatant units arcing first 14 years would bo 937, ineludirg throe and a half per cent par year wastage.-.     Ancillary services, excluding Medical services V-a would absorb approximately 202, .  - Total cpinmisslono to be groritocl annually
during first period. 1139,average of 81 yearly. Committee lay down as essential condition that u its undergoing Indianisation receive precisely similar treatment to other units, and be employed as covering troops in field army, or for internal security purposes, as required.

Second period. Committee recommend Indianisation, by the adoption of the same scale of postings, of 7 cavalry regiments, 40 infantry battalions, 3 pioneer battalions, 6 pack batteries and 11 Engineer units, and proportionate ancillary services. Total officers required including provision for wastage. 2,547, average yearly 182.

Third period. Remaining to be Inaian?od in third period would be 7 osvalry regiments, 34 infantry regiments (sic), 3 pioneer battalions. ? artillery batteries, and 11 Engineer units , with corresponding proportion of ancillary services. Total commissions to be granted inclusive of provision for wastage, 3,178, or 227 annually. Grand total of officers required to Indianise the army in 42 years, including provision for wastage at 31/2 per cent per year. ?864.

Ancillary services for Indian troops.Committee recommend that Indian officers should be first trained, and disciplined with fightlrg units. It follows that these services cannot be Indianised rapidly during first period.

Staff. Indian graduates of Staff College to be equally eligible, with British graduates for staff appointments. Indian officers before selection for staff employment must fulfil all requirements, as prescribed for British officers.


Officers 1 Com it fee proposals, provide that Indian!satioh shall proceed- progrcssivoly upwards&quot;.    Indian- -Officer&quot; will be posted in lowest ranks displacing - equal number &quot;of British Officers.   British&apos; Officers will be required serve only Officers, subject to Army Act.   Fo British Officers will be therefore compelled to serve in a unit in position subordinate to an Indian Officer. During first period, units not under Indianisation will have establishment of British Officers maintained by transfer from-&quot;units under Indianisation, and b^ recruit-ment from Sandhurst as at present.    Committee recommend that, since from commencement of second period Indian Army will-no&apos;longer offer satisfactory prospects of life career to British Officers, all British Officers required for service with Indian-Amy shall be obtained from&apos; British Army, as in case of the&apos; Egyptian Army.   In the - event - of second period being shortened to less than 14-years, entry -of young British. Officers must cease at .some time during first period..   Committee also regard it as essential- to efficiency of, the Army that moans&apos; be- devised of ensuring employment of the old type of Indian Officer, as fully- commissioned Officer.Jirm of Commission.    Cornedttee propose, as first   &apos; step, to standardise the form of Commission to be granted Indian-;.    They arc not in favour of the Dominion practice of granting commissions signed by Governor-General. -; Bavin,-&quot; regard to the inherent parsonal loyalty of the majority of the Indian people to King Emperor, am&quot;  to the fact that, in absence of blood-bond hetreen the British and Indians,  sole sentimental tie is Crown ana Person of the Sovereign,, they recommend that all commissions granted to- .- Indians/
Indians, Including those in Territorial lores, be King&apos;s Commissions in Ills Majesty&apos;a I union lass forces, present Indian titles to be discarded,   :They propose: -Firstly.   That British Officers holding can-missions in regular forces should command all persons subject, to Army, Indian army Auxiliary Fcrse, and Territorial Force Acts,.Secondly.    That: Indian Officers who have passed through Sardhurrtand those already granted Kinghs Commissions,. should possess same powers cf command as British Officers. ,Thirdly o    That Indian Officers granted .Kd.ng-s Commission (? s^omittod) In His 3tajesty:s Indian Land Forces as recommended by the committee, and appointed to -Regular Indian Army.,  should command all persons subject to Indian Army and Territorial Force (? Act)s&apos;. unless otherwise provided by regulationscFourthlyc.   That British Officers, granted Zing/a Commissions in the Auxiliary Force of India, should command only persons subject to Auxiliary Force Act. unless otherwise provided by regulations.Fifthly?    That Indian Officers granted m.L;.:g*3 Commissions in Hi a Majesty f.s Indian land forces for service with Indian Territorial Force,  should command only persons subject to Territorial.Force Act. under (sic ? unless) otherwise provided by regulations * Special regulations defining relative status and powers of command&apos;of Officers cf the several forces serving in India, will be necessary a   These regulations should cover   case of officers of the Regular Forces;   Auxiliary and Territorial Forces when serving together in the same unit or (? land) forces, and &quot;should be framed before any step towards Indianisation is taken.; Pending/- 5 -
Pending disappearance of exist.in --: type of Viceroy&apos;s c arrant onioned officers&apos;, Commit tec recommend that there should be an educational bar in units under Indian!sation.    Thus, in infantry battalion selected for InO.iaiiisn.tion,  there woul; be, 1st, British. Of f icerb&quot; with KLng*s Commissiohs, including Indians who&apos;hate beer: through Sandhurst or the late Cadet College j : Indore, or who have&apos;been granted direct commissions.    2nd, Indian Officers with King&apos;a Commissions in Indian Land Forces granted on graduation from an&apos; Indian Military College.    3rd, Indian Officers who now (? hold omitted) Viceroy&apos;o Commissions, but will in future receive. King&apos;s Commissions in Indian Land Forces.Committee recommend pay of three categories of Officers be determined as follows:-1st.&apos; British Officers, at present rates so long as obtainable at these rates.2nd.    Indian holders of King&apos;s Commissions in Indian Land Forces at .rate &quot;to be fixed on Indian basin, with&apos;&apos; oversea allowance when serving oversea.3rd.   Present Viceroy&apos;s Commissioned Indian Officers, who art.- below educational bar, at rate based, on present pay of Indian Officers of non-silladar cavalry;    If they can pass the educational bar they will be eligible to be admitted to pay, status and powers of command of second category after successfully undergoing two year&apos;s course at a Military College, but &quot;no Officers over 37 years of age will be so eligible&apos;.
Fourth Part.

Indian Military College.

Committee recommend early establishment of an Indian Military College as a primary essential in Indianisation of the Indian army. College will consist of two wings, one taking, for two years&apos; course, selected holders of Viceroy&apos;s Commission, while this class continues available, and thereafter selected Indian non-commissioned officers.  Other wing taking, for three years&apos; course, entrance from Prince of Wales&apos;Royal Indian Military College, Chiefs&apos; Colleges, High Schools, Universities, etc.

From date of opening Indian College, no Indian Cadets will proceed to Sandhurst.

During first seven years, two-thirds of number of commissions granted annually will be given to officers now holding Viceroy&apos;s commissions, after pass (? "ing" omitted)  satisfactorily through Indian Military College. In subsequent years, commissions to be given, 50 per cent to holders of Viceroy&apos;s commissions while available, and to selected non-commissioned officers: 50 per cent to candidates from Dera Dun, Chiefs&apos; Colleges, High School(s), Universities,etc.

Present Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers who pass educational bar, must be ensured fair prospect of attainment of higher rank.

Committee therefore propose that whole or part of service shall count for seniority and promotion. After graduating from the Military
Oollogo fchoy must complete two years1 probation with unit, prior to confirmation..   Military Oollogo will train, also, subjects of Indian States for Commissions in State Forces.Strength of Military College during&apos; first period approximately&apos;350 cadets; during second and third periods, approximately &apos;750 or moreBAs orection of new buildings, etc., for College&apos;would prove very costly, and as they would not bo ready for reception (? &quot;of&quot;&apos; emitted) Cadets for possibly threo of four years from commencement of building, Committee recommend adaptation of small existing cantonment for purpose.&apos;   &apos; Initial&apos; expenditure roughly&quot;estimated at 12 lakhs of&quot;rupebsV     Holiable data, as to total annual cost, not yet available.&quot;Committee claim that their recommendations provide bas&apos;i&apos;s&apos; of workable scheme for most rap 11 practicable ;indianisation of the Indian Army,&apos; while safeguarding efficiency as far as possible,       Scheme is deliberate &apos;( -&quot;&quot;omission) allows of maifitananee ofexisting organisation and &quot;grouping,, &apos;    It obviates costly1 reorganisation on&apos; one hand&apos;, and expensive forms of experiment on the    other hand,-,     It indicates clearly the&apos; mbthod&apos; and time up to final indianis&amp;tion, thus&apos; assuring. Indian.people that ho nest endeavour is being made to give effect to their aspirations. Finally, interests&apos; of existing and future British -officers aro safeguarded,, -. &quot;       -,;-&apos;&apos; End of summary of report
Fifth and last part.Proposals of Government&apos;.     I have carefully con-sidered this scheme in Council, and though not preparedto recommend wholesale adoption without further examin-ation of details^ -we are satisfied that it offers hopeof basis for Indian! sat ion. ..You are aware- of the importance we attach to beingpermitted to declare our po&apos;icy in this matter,  to IndianLegislature, prior to introduction of Budget,  and although we do&apos;riot propose to publish report of the Committee, werequest your early sanction to following &quot;steps being-taken,&apos; Firstly, Legislature to be informed that it is our intention to proceed with Indianlsation of the indian army by means of a progressive policy, working- up by welldefined stages to final Indianisation.&apos; . Statement., basedon report,&apos; to be presented, to-Legislature,- clearly .Indicating procedure proposed&apos; for first period of 14- years.,and containing promise that,.scheme will be given a fairtrial during this.period,    /Subsequent progress of Indian-isation&apos; must depend on results in first period,-     We shouldalso definitely &apos; announce &apos; to the - Legislature, &quot;that althoughexpert military opinion fixes 30 years as minimum period-ithin which completion of Indianisation could be attained,we contemplate possibility, and indeed probability, ofa curtailment of this period if the experiment provessuccessful .&quot;&apos;---S&apos;e con d. l.y, a nr, ou nee me n t to be made th a. t King&apos; commissions &quot;lir &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Indian, land, forces will begranted at an early date to present holders of Viceroy:commissions;    Jemadars as second lieutenants,.Subedars or,honorarylieutenants, Su.bad.ar.majors as     /    -   capt&amp;ins.     All toremain below bar until qualified for absorption intoestablishment/
establishment above It.     Ive regard early grant of these commissions as most Important.     No immediate increase of expenditure is involved as all will be below educational bar.The steps we advocate will be taken as evidence of our sincerity of (? purpose), and will materially ease our difficulties In connection with military expenditure.Thirdly, Legislature to be informed that steps will be taken at once to establish an Indian military college, to be opened in 1923.Fourthly, wo wish permission to publish with our statement of policy regarding Indianisation, such extracts from r eport of Military Requirements Committee as have bearing on the periods of the revision of the ratio of British to Indian troops, see paragraph 58 of that report, in order to show that, contemporaneously (? with omitted) carrying out of the scheme for Indianisation we shall be considering also possibility of reduction of number of British troops in India.
