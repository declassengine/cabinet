[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1922.SECRET.C.P.-3754.m.cabinet.THE PART OF THE AIR FORCE OF THE FUTURE IN IMPERIALDEFENCE.Note by the Secretary.TWO main issues have arisen in regard to which decisions are required. They, are : (1.) Shall the Air Force be maintained as a separate organisation apart fromthe Navy and Army? (2.) If  the  Air  Force is maintained as a  separate  organisation,  whatresponsibilities for the defence of the Empire, borne by the Navy and army, can now be transferred to the Air Force ?2. The first question has arisen out of the consideration of Part I of the Report of the Geddes Committee in which attention is drawn to the overlapping and duplication in the Services of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force.The Geddes Committee proposed as a remedy that a Co-ordinating Authority or a Ministry of Defence be established responsible for assigning to each Service definite functions in regard to the defence of the Empire, and for seeing that suitable provision is made to enable each branch to perform the duties assigned to it.3. The Secretary of State for War proposes (C.P.-3681) that the functions of military advice and administration now performed by the Air Ministry should be transferred to the War Office, and, in order to ensure that the view of the Air Service in all questions of defence is adequately represented, he proposes that the Chief of the Air Staff should be a Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff with a seat on the Army Council.The Secretary of State for War estimates that that transfer would result in a saving, so far as the Army is concerned, of 1\ million pounds a year, and that the arrangement by establishing undivided responsibility and single control would remove the unavoidable friction between the Army and Air Force.3. The Admiralty (C.P.-3700) support the proposals of the Secretary of State for War. They point out that the Board of Admiralty has in the past been responsible not only for advising as to the whole of the requirements necessary for carrying out the naval policy of the Government, but also for seeing that the expenditure approved for that purpose is allocated to the best advantage. They add that the air weapon, which now forms an integral part of our fleet, is the sole exception to that rule. The strength and composition of naval air units now depends upon Air Ministry finance and organisation, although the efficiency of the fleet and its tactical and strategical employment in time of war depend largely upon the efficiency of its air equipment. The Admiralty consider that the air weapon will never be developed satisfactorily for naval purposes until the Admiralty are in a position to supply and administer their own air service, employing a suitable co-ordinating medium in regard to those matters which are common to both the Army and the Navy.In conclusion, the Admiralty request that a strong and impartial Committee be appointed to enquire into the existing defects of the system of naval and air co-operation.[7893]
4. The Secretary of State for Air has replied to the Admiralty and War Office proposals in C.P.-3735 and 3736. He contends that to break up the Air Force would be a retrograde step. He states that other countries are now learning by experience the disadvantages of an Air Service split up between the other two Services.5. The Geddes Committee after reviewing the arguments for and against the abolition of a separate Air Force stated that it was only on financial grounds that their terms of reference would entitle them to express an opinion on the question of a separate Air Force. They reported that they had not been convinced that the Air Force was less economically administered than the other Fighting Services.6. Turning to the second question in regard to which a decision is required, the part to be taken by the Air Force in Imperial Defence has been discussed by the Imperial Defence Committee (vide Minutes of Meetings of the 26th May, 1921, and the 27th May, 1921). No general agreement could be arrived at between the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry on the question of the relative responsibilities of the Air Force in regard to the defence of the country.7. At a meeting of the Standing Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 22nd July, 1921, in view of the difficulty in arriving at a decision acceptable to the three Services concerned, Mr. Balfour undertook to compile a paper which he hoped would assist in reaching an agreement. On the assumption that an independent Air Force was to be maintained Mr. Balfour drew up a paper (149-C), the general conclusions of which were as follows : (i.) That the Air Force must be autonomous in matters of administration and education;(ii.) That in the case of defence against air raids, the Army and the Navy must play a secondary role; (iii.) That in cases of Military operations by land or Naval operations by sea,the Air Force should be in strict subordination to the General orAdmiral in supreme command; and lastly, (iv.) That in other cases (such as the protection of commerce, and attack on enemy harbours and inland towns) relations between the Air Force andthe other Services should be regarded rather as a matter of co-operationthan that of the strict subordination necessary when aeroplanes areacting merely as auxiliaries.Mr. Balfour concluded by saying that he was convinced that any attempt to reduce the Air Force to an inferior position would seriously hamper its vigorous development, and might put us at a serious disadvantage compared with nations who had abandoned rivalry at sea and desired to exploit to the utmost the new weapon.8. Those conclusions were not acceptable to the Naval and Military members of the Imperial Defence Committee; and the Admiralty and War Office prepared papers (150-C and 153-C) expressing dissent from them.(Signed)        M. P. A. HANKEY,Secretary to the Cabinet.%Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,February 17, 1922.
