One cf her boats being hit by rifle fire H.M.S. &quot;Cornflower&quot; shelled the dhow, the crew of which made off to the mainland. Some rifles and ammunition were found In the dhow which has been brought into Jeddel and is being claimed as prise by the Commanding Officer of H.IvI.S. &quot; Cornflower&quot; who proposes to send her to Port Sudan.     The dhow hails from Rabegh.The capture actually took place in Hedjaz territorial waters, but the British Acting Agent at Jeddel considers this immaterial.
PART   II.    GENERAL   INTELLIGENCE,,BUS SI A.According to information received the Soviet Government intends proclaiming an amnesty to Russian emigrants and political prisoners before the opening of the Genoa 0onference.The All-Russian Central Executive Committee, by an order dated 25th January, has permitted complete freedom of movement to Russian citizens on all railways etc Inside Rus sia.GERMANY.The Conference of Ambassadors has decided that 5th February is to be taken as the day on which Article 202 of tho Treaty of Versailles (the surrender of all Military and Naval Aeronautical material to the Allies) shall be consid-ered as having been completely executed.   Three months from this date Germany is to be allowed to commence the con-struction of Civil Aircraft.ARABIA.&quot;King Hussein states th?t he will not ratify the treaty with H.:,:. Government unless the article affecting Ibn Sand and the Idrissi limits these rulers to their pre-war boundaries and authority.   Pie adds that unless he receives a definite answer, either affirmative or negative, to his demands by 27th February he will abdicate.BULGARIA.In view of various reports which have been received to the effect that large quantities of arms have been handed over to the Bulgarians by the French, it is considered that, although it seems probable that a considerable quantity of arms are concealed In the Yambdi ** Kizll Azaoh region and that oontrol by the French has been consistently slack, arms have not actually been transferred.G R S 3 0 E.Greek official accounts state that the situation In Crete is serious, as It would appear that the rising previous-ly reported is developing into an organised rebellion.   H.L1. Consul at Canea reports that considerable artillery and rifle fire was heard on 31st January about 3 miles South of Canea and that 39GCO men were engaged, but casualties were few* The minister of, the Interior has been sent to Crete with instructions to get into toudi with the insurgents and find out what they want.The-1910 and. 1911 classes in Macedonia, Thrace and the Islands have been called up by Royal Decree.   The reason given for this step is that it is to equalise the military burden in old and new Greece.
