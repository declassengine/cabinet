THIS DOCUMENT IS. THE [PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYja G.OVSHMM3NT. T.FOCJT AND MOUTH DISEASE. Memorandum by; -the J^ln;^ster of Health.I think there Is still some misunderstanding aa to the operation of the Cattle Pleuro-Pneumonia Account and its effect upon the Local Taxation Acoount.   The Local Taxation Aocount has not in fact been recouped the sums advanced out of the account to meet deficits, in the Cattle Pleuro-Pneumonia. Accounts   Those deficits have remained as permanent losses to the Local Taxation Account.   It is true that the Ministry of Agriculture and FiSeries obtain.from Parliament in each year a sum equal to that part of the deficit which arisoa in respect of diseases other than swino fever,   Thianum, however, is not recouped to the Local Taxation Account but is merely usod to reduce tho call on that account in tho following year,X appreciate the reluctance of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to impose the whole of thia unforeseen &quot;expenditure on the Exchequer in the Financial Year 19253-33, but, at the same time., I feel that it would be a great hardship upon the local authorities to call upon them to meet this expenditure out of the local rates at a time when the rate burden is so   -notoriously heavy.I would therefore suggest that measures should be taken to spread over a period of years the oost of stamping out this exceptional outbreak of foot and mouth disease.   Up to now the Treasury hag only provided on an average . 9,000
annually for dealing with the diseases other thanSwino fever.     The Aot of 1894 enables the treasury to provide  100,000 annually, and if tho treasury would undertake to aet aside this sum for a period ofyears, the Looal Taxation Account could be recoupod.The Ministry of Health havo power to borrow temporarily .for the purpose of the Local Taxation Account, but theloan haa to be repaid within the financial year of the borrowing.     It would therefore seem preferable thatthe Treasury should borrow for the purpose, and repayas to half, say, themselves out of the  100,000 theycan set aside annually, and as to the other half out of thoLocal Taxation Aooount.A. M0ND.Ministry of Health. 4th March, 1922.
