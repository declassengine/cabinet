In themeantime tho British Delegates are drafting Articlesof Association as a basis for consideration.8.       The. International Labour Office has passed a resolution oppressing a desire to give all theassistance possible and to place at tho oisposal ofthe Genoa Genfcronco tho experience and informationof tho oifico on labour and Industrial matters.Further, the Governing Body has nominated two
representatives.from each of its groups - governora, employers and workers -* who will, with the Director, place themselves at the disposal of the Conference to give any assistance in their power.    It is under-stood that MP Albert Ihomaa1 idea, is that he himself should be present at Genoa, and should summon the nominees of the Governing   Body, if and when they are     required.   The question has to be considered as to what attitude is to be taken towards this offer .9.    SI--nor Gi.ann.in the Italian Liaison Officer, called, on me this morning and save me a &apos;number of particulars, moot Of which have been mentioned above, re-latin;- to the Conference.    The only point on which I felt entitled to enter into a disousaion with him in any detail, related to the Secretariat,   following the precedent of the  supreme Council and other Conferences which I have attended abroach, I gave him to und. erst raid that we would be prepared to give all possible assistance to the Secretary-General in pro-   &apos; ducing the English version of the proceedings of the Conference and I discussed with him many details of purely secretarial procedure,,10*    Signor C-iannini ia to go. to Pome immediately on the appointment of a new Ministry and .1s very anxious to bp able to&quot; ?ive his Goveriameht some idea of the bread of British thevrht -in regard to the Conference.   Bo made it very clear that the Italian Government, which is charged with the conduct of the Conference, desires to act in the closest concert with the British Government, which suggested the Conference,    I pointed cut that the  reach Government would be very auspicious if they thought the British and. Italian Governments were; concert iny/
concerting matters too closely.    To this he replied that an Italian Liaison Officer in Paris in in the. closest touch not only with, the Q,uai d1Oraay but. with li. Seydoux and the various Preach Depart-ments which arc concerned and is receiving from them information as to the views of the French Government.   In view of the obvious desire of the Italian Government to receive assistance and guidance, it would seem net unreasonable that before Signor Giannini leaves he should be given some idea of how the British Government view the question of the Genoa Conference.   The specific points on which he wished information were as foilowb:-(a) The organisation of the Secretariat-General,    (l doubt if anything can be added to what I discussed with Signer Giannini this morning).(b) The organisation and procedure of the Conference, .e.g. the number of Committees to be appointed, their terns of reference and their const!tu-tion, etc.,  suggestions in regard to this are contained in the Reportof the Interdepartmenta1 Committee (C.P . 3702)*(c) The rules for the Conference - Standing Orders.    (personally I attach little Importance to thi3).(d) Concrete proposals under the different items of the Agenda,    (This depends on how far we are prepared, in the interests of co-ordination and rapid progress,.to.show our hand at this stage) .(e) The attitude of the British Government towards the offer of the International Labour Office.(f) The British attitude towards the French Memorandum.11.    I observe from the Summary of Conclusions reached by the Supreme. Council at Cannes (C .P. 36157) that a Committee was appointed to prepare the detailed Agenda, and draft resolutions for the GenoaConference/
Conference para that I was nominated as the British Representative.    Signer Gianninl&apos;a idea was that this Committee should meet at Genoa five or sire days before the opening of the Conference.   By that time the Italian Government fill have received proposals from many of the countries and these can be considered by the Agenda Committee, which can also busy itself with the organisation and final prepare.rati.0n3 for the Conference.   &apos;Thia procedure appears to be business-like and useful.    The proposals of the Inter-departmental Committee,  so far as they relate to the organisation of the Conference and so far as they are approved by the:Cabinst, might perhaps be communicated - to Signor Giahn t hi for the infoirma-tion of the President of the Conference.    It would be for the president of the Conference to comma-ni-cate them to the other Governments represented on the AgenVa Committee.    The way would then be pre-pared for the adoption of these proposals by the Agenda Committee-and they might be announced by the President of the Conference at the first meeting.12.    One further point which perhaps ought to be mentioned is that Signer Giannini tells me that the -Italian Government have notified their intention to offer hospitality to the British Delegation at the Genoa Conference.    This was not done by the French Government at the Paris Peace Conference, nor by the American Government at the Washington Conference.    Signor Giannini stated that one of the reasons why the Italian Government wished to do this was that some of the Governments were so poor that they, would have difficulty in paying the expenses of their Delegations at the present rates/
rates of exchange,    If we are to allow the Italian Government to undertake this burden, I submit that I should be authorised to send a warning to every member of the official staff that the utmost economy must be observed.    In particular I submit that there should be an absolute order tnac no charge should be mads i,. the Italian Government for tobacco of any kind, including cigars and cigarettes, or for wines other than Italian wines of the less expensive varieties.13.    The points on which an early decision is required may be summed up as follows :-(a) The action to be taken in regard to the French cote v(b) The British Ministers to accompany the prime Minister.(c). Approval to the Report of the Inter-depar tmenta1 C ommittee.(d) General approval to the proposed corn-position of the staff of the British Empire Delegation, as attached;(e) Can the general&apos; tenor of the Inter-departmental Report be communicated to SIgnor Giannini,&apos; or by some- &apos; - other method.to the Italian Govern-me nt, and if so,  should it be done., verbally or in writing?(f ) Is the procedure indicated in para,11as regards the Agenda. Committee approved and am I at liberty to ask SignorGiannifii vc suggest iu t.ao lie.....Government that they should summon it five or six days before the Conference?(&amp;) what attitude Is to be taken towards the&apos;.offer of the International Labour &quot;Office?(h) Is the issue of an order&quot;, limiting the expenditure, intending to reduce the charge to the Italian Government apj) roved?(Sgd.)
