HQ, ^/^Note by the Secretary for Mines.M^-^^^^lliQ-VQ boon instructed by the President of the Board of Trade &quot;to circulate to the Cabinet the annexed copy of a Report which was presented to Parliament on February 7th under Section 17 of the Mining Industry Act, 1920, together with a copy of correspondence between the Mines Department and the Mining Association which preceded It and. a copy of the Regulations issuad under Section 7 of the Act.       If the Report lies on the Table of the House for 30 days tho provisions of Part II of the Act are automatically repealed unless in the meantime a resolution to the contrary is passed by both Houses,It will be necessary, therefore, for the Cabinet to consider at an early date what line they propose to take.   Are we to put down a resolution ourselves in favour of the continuance of Part II?   Or are we to allow Section 17 to run its course in silence unless a private member puts down a resolution?   And If a private member puts down a resolution, and time is given for its discussion (as it must be) what attitude are we to adopt towards it?I have no hesitation in advising against our puttimg down a resolution ourselves.     While it is difficult, in my opinion, to find words too strong with which to condemn tho part played by the coal owners, we must not shut our oyes to the facts of the situation.    People cannot be forced to be conciliatory by Act of Parliament.   The success of the scheme contained in Part II is dependent entirely upon the voluntary co-operation of both parties concerned in it.   We are faced with the opposition not only of the coal owners but also of the managers, who are even more resolute in their hostility than the owners, and even of an important section of the men themselves - the National Federation of Enginomen, Boi-lermen and Mechanics, who after the stoppage of last summer severed their connection with&quot; the Miners&apos; Federation,   The introduction of a fresh source of friction into the Mining Industry at the present time is the last thing to be desired.At the same time, if a&apos; debate takes place on a resolution of a private member I think, in view of the history of tho case, and the undesirability of seeming to give any assistance to the coal owners to achieve their policy, that the Government whips should not be put on against the resolution but the question should bo loft to the froe decision of the House.I ought to add that&quot; the Miners1 Federation arc as emphatically in favour of Part II now, as they were emphatically against it eighteen months ago, and that they will certainly endeavour to bring all possible pressure upon the Government to take an active part in securing its continuance.(Initialled)   W. 0 .

REGULATION  OF  COAL  MINES.Report by the Board of Trade under Section 17 of the Mining Industry Act, 1920.By Part II of the Mining Industry Act, 1920, it was enacted that the Board of Trade should by Regulations provide for the constitution throughout the coal mining industry of a system of Committees and Boards equally representative of the owners and management on the one hand and of the workers in or about coal mines on the other. The functions of these Committees and Boards, their procedure and meetings, and the method of nomination or election of their members were to be such as, subject to the provisions of the Act, might be prescribed by the Regulations. Part II of the Act also made provision for the procedure by which, and the lines on which, the remuneration of workers in the industry was to be periodically adjusted.Certain of the principles embodied in Part II of the Act did not in 1920 commend themselves to the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, whose representatives, on the introduction of the Bill, declared their intention of refusing to co-operate in carrying it into effect if it became law.In these circumstances, the Committee to which the Bill was referred for consideration thought it desirable to insert a clause (Section 17 of the Act) which runs as follows : If at the expiration of one year from the passing of this Act it appears to the Board of Trade that the Scheme of this Part of the Act has been rendered abortive by reason of the failure on the part of those entitled to appoint repre-sentatives as members of the Pit and District Committees, Area Boards, and the National Board to avail themselves of such right, the Board of Trade shall issue a report of the circumstances, and that report shall be laid before Parlia-ment, and at the expiration of thirty days during the session of Parliament from the date when it is so laid all the provisions of this Part of this Act shall cease to have effect unless in the meantime a resolution to the contrary is passed by both Houses of Parliament.&quot; The Act received the Royal Assent on the 16th August, 1920. Under the provisions of the Act, the duty of issuing the Regulations referred to fall to be performed,  subject to the directions of the Board of Trade, by me, as Secretary for Mines. I found it necessary to delay performing this duty on account of the national coal strike in October, 1920, and the negotiations which followed between the Mining Association of Great Britain and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.  These negotiations had as their object the detailed formulation of a scheme for the adjustment of wages, &quot; having regard, among other considera-tions, to the profits of the industry,&quot; that is to say, on the lines indicated in Part II of the Act.   It seemed to me that during the continuance of the negotiations it would be futile to issue Regulations which in some respects could not be effective until the negotiations were concluded and would almost certainly have
needed revision in detail in the light of the result. The ncgotia-tions were interrupted by the national stoppage in the coal mining industry, which lusted from the 1st April to the 1st July, 1921, and were only brought to a. conclusion on 12fch August, 1,92.1, with the award of the Independent Chairman of the National Hoard set up under the Terms of Settlement of the dispute on certain outstanding points referred to him.Following this settlement, the Miners&apos; Federation of (treat Britain notified me in a letter dated the .1.2th August, 1921, that lhey were now prepared to co-operate in giving effect to Part 11 of the Act. A few days later 1 received a letter from the Mining Association of Great Britain, dated 16th August, 1921, informing me that the Association considered that the Scheme of Part 11. of the Act had been rendered abortive by reason of the failure el those entitled to appoint representatives of the workers on the various Boards and Committees to avail themselves of such light, and that they had decided not to co-operate in working it. The correspondence which took place, as a, result of this letter, has already been laid before Parliament (Cmd. 1551 of 1921).In the course of this correspondence 1 pointed out that it was impossible for the Scheme of Part II of the Act to be rendered abortive by a. failure to appoint representatives until opportunity had been given for such appointment by the issue of Regulations in accordance with tho Act.In pursuance, therefore, of my obligation under the Statute, I. issued in January last the necessary Regulations, copies of which have been laid before both Houses of Parliament (Statutory Uule and Order, 1922, No. 44).On the 14th January I received a further letter from the Alining Association, a copy of which is printed as an Appendix to this Report, conveying the final refusal of their members to co-operate in working the Scheme of Part II of the Act.The reasons that have led the Mining Association to this decision are fully set out in the correspondence; my criticism of those reasons, and the grounds on which I have ventured to urge a reconsideration of that decision are also stated at length. It is unnecessary here for me to recapitulate the arguments on either side.My opinion, as to the propriety and the expediency of the attitude which the Association had thought fit to take up remains the same. But now that; the Regulations have been issued, and the Association has formally announced its refusal to co-operate in setting up the proposed machinery, I have no alternative but bo report to Parliament that it appears to the Board of Trade that the Scheme of Part II has been rendered abortive by reason of the failure on the part of those entitled to appoint re presents!-lives as members of the Pit and District Committees, Area Boards and the National Board to avail themselves of such right.(Signed)       W.

APPENDIX,Thk Mining Association&quot; of Gukat Buitajx.General Buildings, Aldwych,London, W.C.2,13th January, 1922&apos;,The Uuder-Secretary for Minos, Minos Department,46, Victoria Street, S.W.1.disclosure,The Mining Association have carefully considered, in the interest of and in the light of its effect upon the industry as a whole, the question of the adoption of Part 11 of the Mining Industry Act, 1920.The Mining Association are desirous of seeing tho industry conducted upon lines that will secure the fullest measure of co-operation between employers and workers consistent with the proper and efficient manage-nient of the mines, and after the most careful consideration they have come to the conclusion that this result will not be secured by compelling the industry by Act of Parliament to adopt a particular scheme of administration.To attempt to force upon the industry by compulsion machinery intended to secure fuller co-operation between the owners and the, men would, in the view of the Mining Association, have the very opposite effect to that which its anticipated and desired.The Mining Association is encouraged in this view by the fact that the boards established under the Terms of Settlement on a voluntary prin-ciple have so far been able to deal with the various questions with a minimum of friction.The voluntary agreement entered into between the Mining Association of Great Britain and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, dated the 1st July, 1921, has made provision within the industry for such machinery of administration us is at present practicable, and Part !f of the Mining Industry Act must seriously conflict with the terms of that agreement. The future administration of the industry may, with prudence, and with ultimate practical advantage to the industry, be left to such voluntary arrangements as the parties may from time to time make.Aprt from these main considerations which have specially influenced their decision, the Mining Association have already communicated to you their view, which they reaffirm, that Part II of the Act is rendered abor-tivo by reason of the failure of the parties to avail themselves of the right to appoint representatives as members of the Pit and District Committees, Area Boards, and the National Board.The colliery managers, who are responsible for the safety and working of the mines, have communicated to the Mining Association their deter-mination that they will not accept the responsibility of carrying out their duties if the provisions of Part II of the Act are put into operation, and it is understood that this decision has been communicated to the Department.In view of these general considerations, the Mining Association, speaking as representative of the colliery owners of the United Kingdom, desire to make it clear beyond any possible doubt that in no circumstances will the colliery owners operate Part TT of the Act.Yours faithfully,(Signed)   W.

The Mining Association op Geeat Britain.General Buildings, Aldwych,London, W.C.2.16th August, 1921.Secretary :W. A. Lee, C.B.E.The Under Secretary for Mines, Mines Department,46, Victoria Street, S.W.1.Dear Sir,I have to refer to Section 17 of the Mining Industry Act, 1920, which provides that if at the expiration of one year from the passing of this Act it appears to the Board of Trade that the scheme of this Part of the Act has been rendered abortive by reason of the failure on the part of those entitled to appoint representatives as members of the pit and district committees, area boards and the National Board to avail themselves of such right, the Board of Trade shall issue a report of the circumstances, and that report shall be laid before Parliament.The period of one year expires to-day and I have to inform yon that having regard to the course of events in the coal industry since the passing of the Act, the Central Committee of the Mining Association are of opinion that the machinery proposed in Part II. of the Act is now unnecessary and they have decided not to take part in the establishment of the committees and boards provided for therein.Yours faithfully,(Signed)      W. A. Lee..19th August, 1921.Sir,I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant regarding Part TI. of the Mining Industry Act, 1920.&apos;In reply I am to point out that it is obviously impossible for the scheme of Part II. to be &quot; rendered abortive by reason of the failure of those entitled to appoint representatives as members of the pit and district committees, area boards and the National Board to avail themselves of such right &apos;&apos; until an opportunity to appoint representatives has been given; and no such oppor-
3trinity can exist until the Secretary for Mines has fulfilled his obligation to issue regulations under Section 7 of the Act, pro-viding for the constitution of the committees and boards in question.Mr. Bridgeman has hitherto purposely delayed performing this duty. Negotiations were begun last November between the Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federation for the detailed formulation of a scheme for the adjustment of wages &quot; having regard among other considerations to the profits of the industry,&quot; as provided in Part 11. of the Act, and these negotiations were only brought to a conclusion with the award of the Independent Chairman of the National Board on Saturday last. It seemed to Mr. Bridgeman that during the continuance of these negotia-tions it would be futile to issue regulations which could not be operative until the negotiations were concluded and would almost certainly have needed revision in detail in the light of the result. Now, however, that the negotiations are completed there is no x-eason for further delay and regulations are being prepared which Mr. Bridgeman proposes to submit to the Mining Association and Miners&apos; Federation for the benefit of their criticism and advice, either jointly or separately as may seem to them best. He still trusts that he may have the benefit of the assistance of your Association for this purpose ; in any case the prompt issue of regu-. lations under Section 7 is a statutory duty that he is bound to fulfil.In the absence of any explanation Mr. Bridgeman is quite unable to understand in what way the events of the past year have rendered &quot; unnecessary &quot; provisions for greater co-operation between owners and men into which the wages settlement recently arrived at fits with singular precision, and concerning which a years ago the declaration was publicly made on behalf of the coal-owners : &quot; We shall have difficulties with the provisions of this Bill if they are adopted, but we all intend as coalowners to do our part and work these provisions honourably.&quot;I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)    E.

Shorthand notes of meeting between Secretary&apos; for Mines and Deputation from Mining Association of Great Britain, at the Mines Department on Wednesday, the 24th August, 1921.Mb. Evan Williams : The immediate purpose of our asking a meeting with you this afternoon is to discuss the position in regard to the Mining Industry Act. I think you will be quite well enough aware of the position last year before you took on your present office to know that at no time were the coalowners in love with this Act. I do not know that there was anybody very much in love with it. but it was a difficult time; it was a time when the Government felt that they had to keep the terms which they had made to bring in legislation dealing with the industry. This I think was the outcome of deliberations be-tween the department and the coalowners to start with and the result of the consideration of the matter by the House of Com-mons, at a time which was exceedingly difficult, when the state of the trade was very unsettled, when there were threats of all kinds of things from one side in particular and from other directions possibly as well, and in face of all the circumstances then the coalowners acquiesced in this Act and intended to carry it out. Well, after the Act was passed there was a very clear indication, and even before the Act was passed I. should say there was a very clear indication that the Miners&apos; Federation were not going to enter into it at all and they proceeded to take a line which was quite consistent with that decision of theirs. They ignored the Act and made demands for increases in wages, reductions in the price of coal and many other things which culminated in the Strike of October I think it was of last year.That Strike was settled lvou will remember on lines which had no reference whatsoever to this Act, so that I think we can claim that apart from the Miners&apos; Federation it was the Government themselves who set aside the provisions of the Act in dealing with the questions that arose in the coal trade. The settlement which the3r made then, as I said, had no reference whatsoever to the provisions of the Act; in fact, the only way in which you can consider there was any allusion at all to the Act in the terms of the settlement was when they asked the coalowners and the men to sit down and work out a scheme for the regulation of wages in the industry on the principle of profit-sharing so to speak. (Those are not the exact words but you will understand what I mean.) So that the Government intention in October and November last year was that the owners and the men should themselves voluntarily work out a scheme for the regulation of the wages in the industry. We know perfectly well that at that time and right up to the very end of the Strike the Miners&apos; Federation insisted that wage regulation should be of a national character with the whole of the coalfields of the country combined as one unit for the regulation of wages and it was only after *
severe struggle that they gave up that idea and agreed to a principle which we, in common with the Government, had main-tained throughout, that is, district autonomy as far as wage regulation is concerned.So that I think we are justified in assuming that this Act as far as Part II. is concerned was lost sight of pretty well altogether by all the parties who were concerned in trying, to clear up the complicated affairs of this industry during the period that followed the Strike of 1920. We hud no reference made to it in any way at all during our negotiations either on the part of the owners, the workmen, or the Government. We went on to hammer out a settlement upon lines which had been in the minds of thi&apos; eoalowners for some time and which they had put forward, to the Government before the Strike as the lines upon which a, settlement should be made in their opinion, and as I said, I think we had on our side,T am certain on the men&apos;s side and I am not so sure even on the Government side, pretty well given up any contemplation of proceeding upon the lines laid down in this Act for the settlement of our affairs and particularly those of the regulation of wages.Xow, we have arrived at a settlement with the men voluntarily, a voluntary settlement, and we have started working on the lines of that settlement and we have achieved in that way, with great difficulty and after a good deal of fighting, the main object for which Part II. of this Act set out.There is no doubt that it was the question of the regulation of wages that was considered to be the most important by far by all the parties concerned in all the discussions that we had prior to the introduction of the Bill and during the discussion of the Act that we have now before us, and there is no doubt about it that we feel, as coalowners, that having settled that one question, the most important question and the one which always has been and I fear always will be the most fruitful in trouble and. in dispute in the coal trade, ourselves without any statutory, or I might even go as far as to say any Governmental, interference. As we have between us and the men come to an agreement upon that main question of wages, we feel very strongly that we ought not to be subjected to a statutory obligation upon any other questions which may remain to be settled between us and the men and we think, therefore, that you, as Secretary for Mines, would have been fully justified (I won&apos;t put it stronger than that although I might perhaps)&apos; in acting upon clause 17 of this Act on the date which is referred to in that clause. There is no doubt, can be no doubt, that there was failure on the part of those entitled to appoint representatives as members of these Committees to do so and there is no doubt that the Act had been rendered abortive by reason of that failure and there is,, further, no doubt I-think, and there can be no doubt in the mind of anybody, that there is no longer any necessity--I will put it &apos; no higher than that for the provisions of Part II. in order, that36031a3
the mining industry may be carried on without trouble to the country, with profit to itself and for the general benefit of the community as a whole. We feel, therefore (I do not want to put it in any way offensively and I am quite sure you will acquit me of any desire to be offensive in anything I say) that it would have been better before taking any step in regard to regulations under this Act, if you had, when you had come to the conclusion that the time had come to lay the report before Parliament which is prescribed in clause P7, taken both us and the men into con-sultation upon this matter and ascertained what the general position was and in that way thrashed the question out before committing yourselves in any way at all to put into operation this part of the Act, by intimating to the parties that it was your intention to issue draft regulations. As I said before, the questions that are left, such as they are, for settlement in the coalfield and at the present moment I do not know that there is a single one of them that calls for immediate attention are small in comparison with what has been achieved and we think that after all that the industry has gone through, when it has worked out its salvation upon the main point quite apart from any Act of Parliament or any statutory obligations at all, it will be better, far better in the interests of the industry that it be left entirely unfettered, entirely free from any obligations of any kind under Statute, to set up such an organisation within itself as it may find to be necessary than to have one imposed upon it, under this Act of Parliament, which the men themselves for a whole year have not only turned down but treated with con-tempt, because in that way we should be far more consistent with what is the declared view I think of the House of Commons as well as of the Government that industries should be absolutely free from all interference that is not essential on the part of the executive powers of the country.We have not come here this afternoon to say to you : we are are not going to work the Act; we are not going to do this; or to hold a pistol at your head, or to make threats of any&apos;kind at all, but to appeal to you not to take any step in this matter until both we and you have had further time for consideration and for discussion; when we have explored the whole question in the light of the situation to-day which undoubtedly is different in essence to that which existed when the Act was passed, and I feel quite certain that we have at our disposal in the industry now, by the setting up of this National Board, under the settle-ment that we made with the men, the means whereby everything that is necessary for the industry can be brought into being and organised, without our being more or less compelled to do so by Act of Parliament.I think I have indicated to you what the general feeling of the Committee is. We are not in a position to-day to say to you -definitely that this is the feeling or the opinion officially of the Mining Association, because the Mining Association has not had
135this matter; brought before it now in the way that is prescribed by our regulations. We have after a lapse of twelve months to go back to our districts again and give them time to consider the matter before we can come to you and say this is the collective and official view of the Mining Association on this matter. We shall not be able to put ourselves in that position for some little time. We cannot 1 am afraid get any sort of meeting of the kind that would be necessary before the early days of October, and until we get such a meeting, which meeting must follow of course the consideration of this question in the various districts, until we hold such a meeting we shall not be able to say to you this is the view of the Mining Association upon this matter, but we have already had such an indication among ourselves at the meetings that we have held of the views which are generally held by the members that it is only right that we should tell you of the very strong feeling that does exist that we should avoid in the interests of every body concerned any statutory interference with the industry, now that we have been freed from control and now that we are on the way to settling among oiu-selves, without any legal obligations or any fettering of our action by the terms of an Act of Parliament, all the points which may-arise between us and the men.The Act, of course, does contemplate even after you make the regulations that one side or the other, or perhaps both sides, may refuse to act upon them. There cannot I think in a matter of this kind be any obligation imposed upon one side of the bargain that is not equally imposed upon the other side, and if it was free, as I think we must assume it has been, for the Miners Federation to say they would not work the Act it is equally free I think to the coalowners to say that they will not work the Act. But that is a position we are exceedingly anxious not to get into or to be put into and we do urge you very strongly that you should not take any step in this matter, either by issuing even draft regulations until we have had a Lull opportunity for the discussion of this matter among ourselves and until you on your side have had time and opportunity of considering the matter further in the light of the recommendations we are making to you to-day.Mr. Forgie : I just want to say, as the Chairman has said, we have achieved a great deal since this Act was passed. We have settled most of the points represented in Part II and therefore wc think it only fair that before compulsory powers arc brought in, time should be given to see what is the result of this work under the terms of settlement. We have settled the most important item of all without statutory interference and it is quite possible that we may be able to settle all the other matters without statutory interference. I think the interests of the country and certainly of the coal industry would be served very much better if these matters could be settled without statutory interference. The times have considerably changed since the Mining Industry
Act was passed. At that time there was the constant.fear of trouble in the pits and it was necessary for the Government to take some action in the matter. But all that has been changed. The Mines Department did not see tit to utilise Part 31 of the Act for the purpose of getting a settlement. They ignored the Act altogether and we on our part thought Part 11 of the Act was quite dead then, as we had been asked to mutually make the settlement we did, which is a settlement very much on the lines of Part II--.17/&apos;. Bridgeman : What made you think it was dead? .1//-. Forgie : We practically concluded I for one certainly concluded that Part II of the Act was to be dropped as it was never referred to in the whole course of the negotiations.  We have got this arrangement made and I think before any further action is taken with regard to Part II there should be at least some time given to see whether the coalowners and miners together can settle the points of difference for themselves.    That  is the principal point.    The other point that I wotdd like to make is in regard to the regulations.   The time within which these regula-tions should have been made and put to the test was one year from the passing of the Act.   That time has now passed during which a temporary trial of Part II of the Act should have been made.   The miners objected to Part II of the Act and said they would not work it.   No attempt was made on the part of the Mines Department to pass any regulations at that time, and that is when the regulations should have been made at once after the miners&apos; refusal.   Now the year has expired and the regnla-tions have not been made and the experiment has not been made. Therefore I think it ;is quite reasonable for us to ask you to leave the thing as it stands now under the terms of settlement, and allow the coalowners for a time at all events to prove whether they can settle their own affairs or not, and if it is in the interests of the nation at any future period to step in and say Part 11 must be given a trial 1 think then would be the time to do it, though the present moment is inopportune.   I think the less inter-ference (if I may so call it without offence), or the fewer statutory measures passed with regard to the settlement of the questions that arise between the masters and the men the better.   It can I think easily be done within the National Board and in the District Boards appointed under the terms of settlement. - The less inter-vention on the part of the Government the better, and I think now the year has passed nothing more should be done, but leave the matter in the hands of the coalowners and the men themselves to settle.Mr. Bridgeman : Mr. Evan Williams has given the history of the proceedings, with his usual accuracy, as far as the general points are concerned. He said that in a time of difficulty the coalowners acquiesced in the proposals which were embodied in Part II of the Act. 1 quite agree with that. He also said that at that period the miners refused to send, as we asked them
to do, members, even to the Advisory Committee, and then he said that the Government themselves did not enforce Part II of the Act at that time, and Mr. Porgie contends that if they were going to do it at all that was the time when it should have been done. 1 really think if he had reflected a little further on that point he would have seen, and 1 am sure anybody who tries to put himself in our position during that time would have seen that it would have been perfect folly to try and put in force that part of the Act at a time when the whole industry was in a state of chaos as it has been owing to the two disputes. The fact that we did not get as far as a point where we cotdd break it off, because we had not issued regulations which the miners could refuse was because it seemed madness to attempt to put that part of the Act into force, or even to begin to do it, at a time when feeling was running so high as it was then, and I have not the slightest compunction myself as to our action- or inaction.Now, as Mr. Evan Williams says, the miners have in the settlement given up their idea of a national settlement of wages in favour of a district autonomy ; and that being so, and the owners having, at any rate, got their way in that direction, it does seem to me a very strange course to pursue to say that the other part of the arrangement is not to be carried out in the way that was intended by the Act.Mr. Evan Williams said that in the course of our negotiations no reference was ever made to Part II of the Act as the method for carrying out the terms of the settlement. My memory is not very clear on that point, but I should be very much surprised if, on looking through the reports of the meetings we had, we should not find that it had not been suggested that the way to carry out the settlement and to enforce it must be through the machinery of Part II of the Mining Industry Act. As I say, I cannot actually recollect, but I am quite certain I remember speaking of it privately to representatives of both sides. It certainly is not correct from our point of view to say that Part II was lost sight of and regarded as a dead letter, .Now, with regard to the immediate matter before us, I cannot help feeling that your Association have not quite rightly inter-preted our duties under the Act or the procedure with regard to clause 17 and the regulations. Mr. Evan Williams said that he regretted very much that we had taken any steps at all as to -the regulations, and the inference of that observation was that, before even beginning to consider our regulations, we ought to have entirely reconsidered the position as to whether we intended to make Part II of the Act operative or not. We have been considering the point consistently throughout and have always intended to make Part IT of the Act operative if it were possible io do so and all that we have done has been to announce to both parties that we intended to draw up draft regulations (mark the word &quot;draft&quot;) which naturally - we should have submitted to the consideration of both parties before coming to any final decision about them. Having made that announcement we are met by a letter from the Mining Association stating that &quot; the
period of one year expires to-day and 1 have to inform you, having regard to the course of events in the coal industry since the pass--ing of the Act, the Central Committee of the Mining Association are of opinion that the machinery proposed in Part 1L of the Act is now unnecessary and that the)&apos; have decided not to take part in the establishment of the Committees and Boards provided for therein.&quot; Well, I fail entirely to see why the machinery now is not as necessary, and almost more necessary than it was before, but you woidd be entirely misinterpreting our attitude if you assume that we had any intention of issuing these regulations until we had had the opportunity of submitting them to both parties for their criticism and observations. There would have been no other way. We are bound under the Act to issue these regulations, and until we have done that there is no question of either party refusing or agreeing to come under the Act. There is only one way in which we could have consulted the interested parties with any chance of coming to an early agree-ment and that was by drawing up some form of regulations for them to go through and to mark and to criticise in any way they thought best. That is what we have done, and that is the course which we are bound to take under the Act. After the issue of regulations is the time when both sides are asked to send their representatives to the different committees and it is only then that &quot; if it appears to the Board of Trade that the scheme has been rendered abortive by reason of the failure on the part of those entitled to appoint representatives as members of the Pit and District Committees, Area Boards, and the National Board to avail themselves of such right, the Board of Trade shall issue a report of the circumstances and that report shall be laid before Parliament,&quot; etc. The procedure would be this. We draft our regulations, and we ask you and the Miners&apos; Federation to consider them. I should like it still better if a small committee consisting of two or three of each would consider them together. Having done that and having had the benefit of the criticism which we should get, we should have to issue the, regulations in the best form we covdd the form which seemed to us best in the light of the advice we had received from either side. It would then be for either side, or for both sides, to send their representatives to these different committees and boards and if either side then refused to do so then we have to report to Parliament during a Session of Parliament. That report has to be laid for thirty days and we can either ask Parliament to agree to allow Part IT to pass out of existence or we can ask them to pass a resolution to enforce it.   That is the position we are in.You have spoken frankly to mo and I hope you \von&apos;t mind my speaking rather plainly to you on this point. It has been urged that if the Miners&apos; Federation could hold up the working of this part of the Act for a year, that was a sufficient reason for the Owners&apos; Association, who had already agreed to work it. to go back on that agreement and now say they would have nothing to do with it.   It rather reminds me of the parable of the man
who hail two sons and told each to go on an errand. One said &quot; I go not &quot; but went and the other said &quot;1 go &quot; but went not. In this case you said &quot;I go &quot; in favour of working this part of the Act, but according to the attitude of the present I moment it appears you are not going to do so. On the other hand the miners said they would not go, and now are going. I think public opinion would be, as in the case of the parable, on the side of those who formed a bad resolution at first and thought better of it later.J3ut 1 really think that any decision not to work this Act  ami I feel this so strongly that I will say it as plainly as I. can would be perfectly calamitous at this moment, not only in the interests of the whole trade, but especially in the interests of your own Association. You are now in a position of having pr-oposed what I think and I have always done my best to make it clear is a very handsome scheme of profit-sharing to the industry better than any other industry has ever had offered to it. The public are fully aware, or a 1 great many of them all fair-minded men are aware of the fairness of the offer which you have made and on which the settle-ment is based. To give the slightest appearance of trying now, at a time when to all outward appearance you are rather on the top of the wave and the men are under it, to go back in any way on anything that has been stated by your spokesmen in the House of Lords, or on the Sankey Commission, or anywhere else, seems to me to be a course which would immediately create friction, and difficulty, and undo a very large part of the good which has been done in this settlement. I, therefore, beg that you will under-stand quite clearly first of all that we regard it as our duty to proceed with the drafting of regulations. We do not wish to I make those regulations in any way disagreeable either to you or to the men&apos;s representatives. If you and they can agree ! upon them all the better. We want to make them agreeable to both parties. Anybody who imagines that any Government Department wants to interfere in any industry more than it j can possibly- help cannot have had any very intimate friends in any-Government Department. We don&apos;t want to do that. We want to help the industry to work out its own salvation, but I want you to be perfectly clear that this is the course that we feel bound to pursue and I hope that you will make it easy for us to do that, and I venture to think that it is not for this Department that I am asking that so much as in the interests of your own Association and of the harmony of the industry as a whole.
The Mining Association of Great Britain.General Buildings, Aldwych,London, W.C.2.19th October, 1921.Secretary :W. A. Lee, C.B.E.By Hand. . .The Under Secretary lor Mines, Mines Department,46, Victoria Street, S.W.1.Dear Sir,I am instructed to inform 3&apos;ou that the following resolution was passed by 136 votes to 6 votes at a meeting of the Council of the Mining Association held on the 13th instant : &quot; That the Council of the Mining Association of Great Britain having reviewed the provisions of Part II of the Mining Industry Act, 1920, in the light of the existing position in the industry is of opinion that :-(1) the voluntary agreement made on the 1st July last between the owners and workmen has achieved the objects aimed at in Part II of the Mining Industry Act;(2) the re-imposition of any measure of Government control over wages and allied questions would be con-trary to the best interests of the industry itself and of the community;(3) the administration of Part II of the Mining Indus-try Act would add unnecessarily to the burden of taxation, and that, seeing that during the period of more than twelve months which has elapsed since the passing of the Act the Government themselves have ignored Part II of the Mining Industry Act, none of the Committees or boards prescribed therein have been established, but a voluntary agreement to which the Government were parties and with which Part Ii of the Act is in conflict has been made, and having regard to the provisions of Section 17 of the Act which prescribes that :&apos;-&quot; If at the1 expiration of one year from the passing &quot; of this Act it appears to the Board of Trade that the &quot; scheme of this part of the Act has been renderedabortive by reason of the failure on the part of those &quot; entitled to appoint representatives as members of the &quot; pit and district committees, area boards, and the &quot; National Board to avail themselves of such right, tne &quot; Board of Trade shall issue a report of the circum-&quot; stances, and that report shall be laid before Parliament, &quot; and at the expiration of thirty days during the session &quot; of Parliament from the date when it is so laid all &quot; the provisions of this Part of this Act shall cease to have effect unless in the meantime a resolution tothe contrary is passed by both Houses of Parliament.&quot;
L/1535.26th October, 1921.Sm,I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to refer to your letter of. 19th October, in which you convey the views of the Council of the Mining Association that Part II of the Mining Industry Act, 1920, should not be operated, that the question of issuing regulations under Section 7 does not arise, and that it is incumbent upon, the Secretary for Mines to issue forthwith a report under Section 17 of the Act that Part II of the Act has been rendered abortive.On the question of procedure Mr. Bridgeman&apos;s position has already been fully explained to your Association both in the , Department&apos;s latter of 19th August last and again at the meeting which took place between Mr. Bridgeman and members of your Central Committee on 24th August last. His position is that, whether ultimately this part of the Act is operated or not, he has no option at the present stage but to issue regulations. Section 17 of the Act is applicable only to circumstances in which it appears , to the Secretary for Mines that the scheme of Part II has been rendered abortive &quot; by reason of the failure on the part of those entitled to appoint representatives. . . . to avail themselves of such right.&quot; Representatives, if appointed at all, must be appointed in accordance with the regulations (Sections 7, 8, 9, 10 and. 12) ;.and no person therefore can Have the right to appoint representatives, and no person can fail to exercise that right, : until regulations have first been issued. In any event, therefore, &apos; Mr. Bridgeman has no discretion whether or. not he will issue regulations; no expression of opinion or declaration of intention on the part of either owners or workpeople, can relieve-him -of his statutory obligation to do so. . . ...It will be clear to your Council, on reference to my letter, of the 19th August, that Mr. Bridgeman cannot accept the state-ment contained in your CounciPs resolution that ,&quot;. during, the period of more than 12 months which has elapsed since the passing of the Act the Government have ignored Part TT of thethe Mining Association respectfully submit to the Board of Trade that the question of issuing regulations under Section 7 of the Act does not now arise as. it is incumbent upon the Board to issue forthwith and lay before Parliament a report under Section 17 of the Act that Part II of the Act has been rendered abortive.&quot;I am to add that the six dissentient members concurred in the views expressed in the first part of the resolution and were of opinion that having regard to the adoption of the voluntary scheme for the regulation of wages in the Industry, the issue of regulations under Part II of the Act should he postponed.Yours faithfully,(Signed) W. A. Lee.
Act.&quot; The reasons which rendered an earlier issue of rcgula-tions impossible were fully explained in the third paragraph of that letter, and Mr. Bridgeman is advised that this delay will not impair his obligation to issue a report in accordance with Section 17 should the circumstances contemplated in that section eventually arise.It should be understood that Mr. Bridgeman does not suggest that these points are of material importance except as an explain- j nation of the reason why he cannot accept your CoctnciTs view that the question of issuing regulations does not arise and that jt is incumbent upon him forthwith to issue a report under Section 17 of the Act. He recognises that they have no bearing \ upon the major question whether your Association will be pre-pared to co-operate in giving effect to Part 11 of the Act when the regulations are issued.On this question your Council adduce three reasons why j Part II should not be operated.They state that &quot;the voluntary agreement made on the 1st July last between the owners and workmen has achieved the objects aimed at in Part II of the Mining Industry Act.&quot;The objects aimed at in Part II of the Act are, broadly, three. First, it sets up machinery such as was recommended by the representatives of the owners on the Coal Industry Commission for the participation of the workpeople in pit and other Com-mittees in order (in the words of those representatives) that &quot; full and regular opportunity should be given to each party to bring forward for discussion any question of mutual interest &quot; : together with machinery by which the decisions of certain of those committees can be made effective. Secondly, it provides for the regulation of wages by reference to profits. Thirdly, it contemplates a reversion to the system of district settlement of wages.It is true that the second and third objects have been attained by voluntary agreement, but it does not seem to Mr. Bridgeman that there is any point upon which the agreement and the Act are in these respects fundamentally inconsistent o&apos;r upon which they cannot readily be reconciled. And he does not see how it can seriously be contended that the first of the three objects enumerated above has been secured by the agreement. In any event, the force of this contention appears to depend almost entirely upon the question whether the same view is held by the workpeople&apos;s representatives. Mr. Bridgeman understands that it is not.Secondly, the resolution states that &quot; the reimposition of any measure of Government control over wages and allied questions would be contrary to the best interests of the industry itself and of the community.&quot; Mr. Bridgeman agrees. But if your Council will refer to the actual provisions of Part II they will see that the powers of the Secretary for Mines in respect of those matters are limited to giving mandatory force to recommendations which have already been made by the industry itself. He has no power to modify those recommendations or to impose any con-ditions which the industry itself has not actually invited him to impose.
The third reason is that &quot; the administration of Part II of the Mining Industry Act would add unnecessarily to the burden of taxation.&quot; Mr. Bridgeman is not aware upon what information or conjecture this statement is based. He is glad, however, to take this opportunity of relieving at once any apprehension that your Council may have on this score. It is unlikely that any additional burden whatever would be imposed on the taxpayer by the administration of this Part of the Act; if any additional expense were involved its amount would be negligible.Mr. Bridgeman trusts that your Council will reconsider the whole question in the light of the foregoing remarks before com-mitting themselves to a course which he fears might create an unfortunate impression, in view of the public declarations made last year on behalf of the coalowners that, whatever difficulties might arise in giving effect to the provisions of the Act, they would do their part and work them honourably.In the meantime Mr. Bridgeman hopes that notwithstanding the attitude at present adopted by your Council he may have the benefit of their assistance towards framing the regulations in such a way as would be best calculated to promote the smooth working of the scheme if both parties were to decide, when the time comes, to co-operate in it, or if Parliament, on a report being made under Section 17, were to resolve that the provisions of Part II must remain on the Statute Book.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)      E. A. Gowers.The Secretary,The Mining Association of Great Britain, General Buildings, Aldwych, W.C.2.The Mixing Association of Great Britain.General Buildings,Aldwych, London, W.C.2.3rd November, 1921.The Under Secretary for Mines, Victoria Street,London, S.W.I.Dear Sir,I laid your letter of the 26th ultimo, L/1535, with regard to Part II of the Mining Industry Act, before a meeting of the Central Committee of the Mining Association held on the 27th ultimo, and am instructed to convey to you the views of the Committee on the various points dealt with in your letter.The Committee observed that Mr. Bridgeman is of opinion that he cannot issue a report that there is refusal on the part of those entitled to appoint representatives on the committees and boards to do so until he has completed the formality of issuing regulations for the constitution of the committees and boards. The Com-mittee are unable to appreciate the technical difficulty as the
main character and functions of the committees are laid down in the Act itself and cannot be varied by regulations, the pro-visions of which are therefore of a purely subsidiary character.The Committee note the observations contained in the third paragraph of your letter with regard to the delay which has taken place in taking steps to give effect to Part II. of the Act. The\ quite understand that the failure to issue regulations up to the present time is justified on the practical ground that in face of the refusal of the workmen Is side to operate Part II. of the Act the preparation and issue of regulations would have been merely a waste of time and labour, but they would point out that in view of the intimation of the Mining Association that the owners can-not agree to operate Part IT. of the Act, the situation is unaltered in that respect.In this connection I have to point put that when the voluntary wages agreement was concluded in July last, an agreement to which the Government as well as the Mining Association of Great Britain and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain were parties, the machinery which was set up differed in important respects from that contemplated in Part II. of the Act, and omitted the element of Government control, to which, as previously indicated, the owners are strongly averse. There is no doubt whatever that both the owners&apos; and workmen&apos;s sides regarded the voluntary arrangement as self-contained.Apart from these considerations, however, the period of twelve months prescribed by Section 17 of the Act expired on the 16th. August last. In the view of the Mining Association therefore the question of issuing regulations does not now arise, and the Association cannot see their way to take part in the consideration of such regulations.The Committee note that Mr. Bridgeman agrees that of the three main objects aimed at in Part II. of the Act two have already been attained by voluntary agreement, but that he sug-gests that this is not so in the case of the third object, i.e., the participation of the workpeople in machinery designed to secure opportunities for the discussion with the management of questions of mutual interest, and the putting into operation of decisions arrived at after such discussion.On this point the Committee feel that it is not fully realised that there are in existence at the present time arrangements of a voluntary nature by which representatives of the men inter-view the management at the pits (or the management seek an interview with representatives of the men) on any question which requires discussion, and that there is also provision in the form of disputes committees and district boards in the various coal-fields for the discussion and settlement of questions not settled locally, or of questions affecting the whole district. In general the existing machinery meeis the demands made and likely to be made upon it, but the owners are always prepared to consider with the men proposals having for their object the improvement
of the existing voluntary machinery in particular cases in which it may be found defective. They feel it necessary to emphasise that the introduction of arrangements of a compulsory character, far from improving the present arrangements, would involve the risk of widespread friction between management and workmen.This view is shared by colliery managers generally, who are of opinion that a system of compulsory committees would seriously hamper them in the execution of their duties as the officials respon-sible under the Mines Acts for the safety of the mines.As regards the question to what extent the operation of Part 11. of the Mining Industry Act would involve the re-imposition of I Government control over wages and allied questions, the Com-mittee are unable to agree that the powers of the Secretary for : Mines are limited to giving mandatory force to recommendations I which have already been made by the industry itself.    For I example, on the most important question of all, i.e., the principles on which schemes for adjusting the remuneration of workers are to be framed, it is competent for the Board of Trade under Ij Section 12 (2) of the Act to withhold their sanction from schemes I which may be approved by the main body of opinion on both :; sides within the industry itself.Apart from this, however, the experience of the past justifies the fear that the existence of provisions such as those referred I to above will inevitably result in the Department being frequently I drawn into disputes, and having regard to their experience of I the constantly recurring disputes of the past few years under I G-overnment control, and the increasing tendency to refer all I kinds of questions to the Department, the owners feel that peace I will best be secured in the industry in the future as in the past I by discussions between the parties directly involved, with voluntary I reference to arbitration in cases in which it may be deemed desirable.I With regard to the question raised in your letter as to the I information or conjecture upon which the Association express 1 the opinion that the administration of Part II. of-the Act would I add unnecessarily to the burden of taxation, I am to point out-I that the Act itself makes provision for expenditure by the Depart-\ ment up to a. limit of . 250,000 per annum. This appears to j be very considerably in excess of the amount required to carry ; out the remaining, statutory duties of the Department,, having I regard to the pre-war cost of the principal of these duties, i.el, i the. administration of the Coal Mines Acts and Begulations, andit is clear from the draft code of 77 regulations which has already j been prepared by the Department for the purposes of Section. 7of the Act, apart from the general provisions of the Act.itself, I that a very considerable amount of administrative work would 1 be throWn upon the Department which might well involve the l necessity of aii application to Parliament at an early date for anincrease in the.maximum of  250,000 already sanctioned, whereas f one of the most urgent needs, of the present time is a substantial i reduction in Government expenditure. v./  &apos;
Reference may be made in this connection to the draft regula-tion which prescribes that at every one of the pits (numbering approximately 3,000), at which a committee may be established, formal minutes shall be kept which shall be available at all times for inspection by a duly authorised officer appointed by the Secretary for Mines.In the last paragraph but one of your letter reference is made to declarations of coalowners at the time of the passing of the Act, but 1 am to point out that while reluctantly agreeing to withdraw their opposition to its provisions they clearly expressed the view that they were not in sympathy with the compulsory element in Part II. of the Act, and only acquiesced in it in the absence of an alternative. That alternative, as has previously been stated, provided for the voluntary arrangements since entered into, and the Committee are unable to depart from the decision reached at the meeting of the Council of the Association on the 13th instant, which was conveyed to you in my letter of the 19th.Yours faithfully,(Signed)      W. A. Pee.L/1535.17th November, 1921.Sir,I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 3rd November relating to Part II of the Mining Industry Act.Mr. Bridgeman does not think that any useful purpose would be served by dealing at any length with the various points which your Council raise. He has already expressed his views upon them fully on other occasions, and he only wishes to make three further comments.First, your Council appear to be still under the misapprehension that the reason why regulations were not issued during the past year was the declaration of the Miners&apos; Federation that they would refuse to co-operate in Part II of the Act. Mr. Bridgeman would never have regarded this as an adequate reason for not issuing regulations. The true reason is fully stated in my letter of 19th August.Secondly, you argue that existing machinery fenders unneces-sary statutory provisions for giving the workpeople opportunities for discussion with the management. But such machinery as may exist at present existed equally at the time when the coal-owners&apos; representatives on the Coal Industry Commission expressed the view that Pit Committees should be established at every colliery, and when your Association acquiesced in the provisions for this purpose contained in Part II of the Act. As lo the compulsion, from which you fear &quot; widespread friction,&quot; I am to observe that the establishment of Pit Committees is not
1.1)compulsory under the Act except where the workpeople so desire. 11 they are content with the existing machinery they need make&apos; no change.Thirdly, Mr. Bridgeman notes your Councils conjecture that the burden of administration of Part II would be likely to lead to an application to Parliament for an increase in the limit imposed on the expenditure of this Department. Mr. Bridgeinan appreciates this evidence of your Councils solicitude for the public purse, but must ask them to accept the assurance already given by him that there is no danger of their conjecture being realised. The essential principle running through the provisions of Part II. is that the industry should manage its own affairs without interference by the Government. Mr. Bridgeman has neither the power nor the desire to administer it in any different !   spirit.Tn conclusion, Mr. Bridgeman wishes very briefly to restate his position, as the broad facts of the situation seem to him to have been rather obscured by the discussion of detail.Part II of the Mining industry&quot; Act was designed to give effect to a system of co-operation which the coalowners themselves definitely offered to their workpeople, and which Parliament, with the acquiescence of the coalowners, decided to endorse by legislation. The workpeople, who had not then abandoned a more far-reaching policy, were not content with the offer. Parlia-nient, therefore, inserted a clause to ensure that provisions which were bound to be futile without the co-operation of those for whose benefit they were intended should not remain indefinitely on. the statute book in the event of that co-operation not being forthcoming. Tins clause is called in aid by the coalowners, as entitling them to recede from their offer although the workpeople are now anxious to co-operate. Mr. Bridgeman has already ventured to express very frankly his opinion of the propriety and expediency of this course. But that is a matter on which Parliament will eventually have to give its verdict, if the present decision of your Council is carried into effect. Mr. BridgemaiPs duty, as he conceives it, is perfectly clear. If the owners and the workpeople were able to submit to him agreed alternative proposals that would justify him in inviting Parliament to repeal or to amend Part II of the Act the position would obviously be materially changed. In the meantime he is bound to proceed with the regulations without which the provisions of Part II are inchoate, and can be neither operative nor abortive.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)   E.

STATUTORY RULES AND ORDERS, 1922, No. 44.MINES. Coal Mines.The Mining Industry (Committees and Boards) Begulations, 1922, dated January 16, 1922, made by the Board of Trade under section 7 op the Mining Industry Act, 1920 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5, c. 50), por the constitution of Com-.mittebs and Bcards under part II op the act.In pursuance of the provisions as to the regulation of Coal Mines contained in Part II of the Mining Industry Act, 1920, the Board of Trade hereby make the following Begulations thereunder, and direct that such Begulations shall apply to the Coal Mining Industry in Great Britain.Part 1. Pit Committees.1. At every coal mine in Great Britain where more than 30 persons are employed below ground, a vote shall be taken, in the manner provided in the first schedule hereto, by ballot (herein-after called the Preliminary Ballot) of the workers employed in or about the mine, upon the question whether or not a Pit Coim mittee shall be constituted for the mine.2. Where a majority of the workers entitled to vote do not vote in favour thereof, there shall be no obligation under the Act to establish a Pit Committee, but if after the expiration of one year from the date of the Preliminary Ballot the owner, agent or manager of the mine, or not less than one-tenth of the workers entitled to vote by signed notice served on the owner, agent or manager, demand a further ballot on the question, a further vote shall be taken in the manner hereinbefore provided, and if a majority of the workers entitled to vote then vote in favour of the constitution of a Pit Committee, these Begulations shall apply as if they had so voted at the original ballot.3. Where a majority of the workers entitled to vote vote in favour thereof, a Pit Committee shall be constituted in the manner hereinafter provided.4. A Pit Committee shall consist of such even number of members, not exceeding ten in all, as may be agreed between the management and the workers. Half (hereinafter called owners&apos; representatives) shall be appointed by the owners as repre-sentatives of the owners and management of the mine, and half (hereinafter called workers&apos; representatives) shall be selected from among the workers employed in or about the mine as their representatives :[Price 3d. Net.]
Provided that one of the workers&apos; representatives shall be a representative of the surface workers of the mine, and shall be separately elected by the surface workers.5. The names of candidates for election to the Pit Committee us workers&apos; representatives, including the representative of the surface workers, must be handed in writing to the manager of the mine, or to such person or persons as the manager may appoint for the purpose, not later than 6 p.m. on the third day after the Preliminary Ballot. If there is their only one candidate to represent the surface workers that candidate shall be declared duly elected, and if the number of candidates to represent the other workers (hereinafter called underground workers) does not exceed the number to be elected, those candidates shall be declared duly elected. Notice in writing of such election, signed by or on behalf of the manager and the workers, shall be exhibited and shall remain exhibited in a conspicuous place at the mine.6. If there are more than one candidate for election as the representative of the surface workers, such representative shall be elected by ballot of the surface workers; and if the number of candidates for election as underground workers&apos; representatives exceeds the number to be elected, such representatives shall be elected by ballot of the underground workers. Every such ballot shall be taken in the manner provided in Part I of the First Schedule hereto, and the candidates obtaining the largest number of votes shall, according to the number of vacancies, be declared duly elected :Provided that in the event of an equality of votes between two or more candidates for one vacancy, the election for that vacancy from among those having such equality shall be decided by the drawing of lots under the supervision of the persons appointed by the workers to carry out the ballot.7. The owners&apos; representatives on the Pit Committee shall, so far as possible, be chosen so as to represent the various grades and responsibilities of the management as hereinafter defined, and may be changed from time to time as may be deemed desirable for the purpose of enabling the Committee to deal satisfactorily with the subjects for consideration.8. There shall be a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman of the Pit Committee. The owners shall nominate the Chairman from among their representatives on the Committee, and the workers&apos; representatives on the Committee shall nominate one of their number as Vice-Chairman.9. For the purpose of any reconstitution of the Committee, the members shall be elected or nominated by the means herein-before provided for the constitution of the Committee, and any vacancy arising in the membership of the Committee during its term of office shall be filled by the same means as those by which the previous member was elected or nominated, and,
subject to the provisions of Clause 7, the new member shall continue in office until the expiration of the term of office of his predecessor :Provided that, where the previous member was elected by ballot, it shall be open to the remainder of the workers&apos; representatives on the Committee, if they think fit, to fill the vacancy from among the surface or underground workers, as the case may require, who were unsuccessful candidates for membership at that election, by co-opting the unsuccessful can-didate still being a worker employed in or about the mine who received the largest number of votes therefor.10. Subject to the provisions of-the Act and of these Regula-tions, every Pit Committee shall frame its own rules as to procedure&quot;, period of office, and appointment and duties of Secretary, and the rules so made may provide for the attendance at any meeting of the Committee, either personally or by repre-sentation, of any workman or workmen not being members of the Committee who may be specially concerned in any matter which may be under consideration at any such meeting:Provided that a copy of the rules and of any subsequent alterations therein, shall be submitted to the District Committee, constituted as hereinafter provided for the district in which the pit is situated, who may disallow or vary any of such rules as appear hi them to be undesirable or to require variation.11. The Committee shall meet at least once in each calendar month, and more frequently aw may be decided by the Chairman and Vice-Chainna-n. All meetings shall beheld as far as possible outside the ordinary hours of work of tho members of the Committee.12. The functions of a Pit Committee shall be those specified in Section 8 of the Act;, as set out in Part T of the Second Schedule hereto, and the Committee shall be furnished with such information and facilities as is therein provided.13. No dispute in connection with the mine shall be. considered by the Pit Committee, until the owners and management shall have had an opportunity of dealing with the matter by direct negotiations with the workers or their representatives in accordance-nnce with the custom prevailing at the mine.14. Questions which are not confined in their scope to the particular mine, and questions which are discussed but not made the subject of a recommendation by the Pit Committee, shall be referable to the District Committee, except; that if in either case the question relates to a matter to which the Coal Mines Act, J911, applies, any such reference shall be to His Majesty&apos;s Inspector of Mines for the Division instead of to the. Committee.15. Any question which is referable either to His Majesty&apos;s Inspector&apos; of Mines or to the District Committee may be so referred by either side of the Committee, that is to say, either by the owners&apos; or workers&apos; representatives, if a majority of that side desires so to refer it:1.4070
Provided that in the case of the workers&apos; representatives any such reference to the District Committee shall only be made after-consultation with the accredited representatives of any trade union or trade unions to which they may belong, and in accordance with the rules and practices of such trade union or trade unions.16. Recommendations made by a Pit Committee shall be communicated to the manager, who shall take them into con-side ration ; but nothing in these Regulations shall be construed as derogating from the&apos; statutory powers, duties and responsibilities of the manager.17.
