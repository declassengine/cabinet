(This document is the property of His Britannio Majesty&apos;a Government). JMC D EN T I A Ii.P. 5766, CABINET.HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE BILL.Memorandum hy the Home Secretary.The objeots of this Bill are i-(a) To extend the statutory time for preparing and printing the half-yearly registers of electorst(b) To prevent recent inoreases in postal charges for printed packets being treated as expenses of candidates at eleotions for the purpose of any statutory limitation of those expenses;   and(o) To save expense by enabling electoral divisions for the election of county councillors to be altered without holding a looal Inquiry in oases when there is no opposition,(a) THE REGISTERS, .&apos;1. The Representation of the People Act, 1918, prescribes that the qualifying period should end on the 15th January for the Spring register and on the 15th July for the Autumn register.     As the Act also requires the Spring register to come   into forne on the 15th April and the Autumn register onthe 16th October, three months only are available in either oase forpre-paring and printing the register,2. The experience of all interests concerned has shown that four months are needed for compiling and printing the register;   and h the R.T.* Orders in Council, made under the emergency powers of Section 46 of the Aot, have extended, the period in every oaae to four months.    Those powers, however, expire one year, after the termination of the war;   and statutory provision must accordingly be made at a very early date to meet the situation whioh will arise upon their lapse,3. The Autumn register is used at the municipal elections on 1st November&apos; and 15th October must therefore be retained as the date of its ooming into force.     The additional time could thus more suitably be secured by altering the qualifying periods than by disturbing the dates fixed for the registers to oome into force,4, The subject has been discussed at several Conferences between repre-sentatives of Government Departments, Registration Officers and Agents of the chief political organisations, and the schedule of dates proposed for England and Wales is the outcome of these Conferences, no. other scheme of dates having been found to secure any substantial measure of agreement. These dates have been adopted by, Order in Oouncil for the last three registers and have met with no oritloism.    The scheduled dates for Scotland are as proposed by the Scottish Offioe,5, The dates for Northern Ireland are as suggested by the Minister jf Home Affairs, Belfast, who desires their annual register to oome into foroe on 15th December as the result of representations by party organisations and
pthere thet the holiday months of July and August are extremely inoon-venient for claims and objections.    There is some inoonvenienoe in adopting this date, as, in the event of a future General Election for the. Imperial Parliament being contemplated between 16th Ootober and 16th Deoember Northern Ireland might objeot to the date as involving the election of their 13 members on a &quot;stale&quot; register, but we must, no doubt, aoquiesoe in the wish of the Government of Northern Ireland,6, Southern Ireland is excluded from the Bill at the request of the Provisional Government,(b) CANDIDATES&apos; EXPENSES 1   INCREASED POSTAL CHARGES.7, Complaints have been made from time to time that the increased postal charges have seriously affected oandidates at parliamentary and looal elec-tions, whose expenses 4are limited by statute.    Any proposal to raise the present limits on the expenses of candidates would undoubtedly be highly controversial, and I think that the grievance would substantially be removed-by reokoning (as proposed in Clause 2 of the Bill) for the purposes of the statutory limit any expenditure by oandidates in the form of postal charges f^r printed packets as though it had been incurred at the rates in foroe in 1919, thus excluding from the calculation any expenditure due to the subsequent inoreaBe in rates.     If and when the postal charges return to the 1919 level the Clause will cease to have any effect.     Agents from the Central Offices of the four ohief politioal parties have aoquiesce4 in the justice of this method, and this method was mentioned by Dr, Addison as likely to be adopted in Standing Committee on the Representation of the People Bill, 1920,, wfee-a. he was resisting amendments to increase the limits for expenses,8. The 1919 printed packet rates adopted as the standard are those which were in foroe when the present limits an expenses were enacted in the ease of looal eleotiqnsi   viz, Jtfi. for 1 oz;   Id, for 2 ozs.    TheBe rates were also in foroe at the last General Eleotion,    At a parliamentary eleotion the candidate^ may send to each elector one postal communication of 2 ozs, free of oharge. and it is only seoond and subsequent communications of whioh the oost falls on the candidate.    Such communications are not likely to exeeed 1 oz, for which the charge is now Id.     Accordingly, so long as the present postal charges continue, the general effect of the Clause so far as parliamentary elections are concerned is that of every Id, spent on postage only       will be reokoned for the purpose of the statutory limit on expenditure,(o) LOCAL INQUIRIES. 9, In all oases where an application is made under the Local Govern-ment Aot, 1888, for an alteration of the boundaries or number of eleotoral &quot;ivisione af a oounty, it is obligatory at present that a looal inquiry should be held before the application can be granted.     Inquiries are unnecessary if there is complete looal agreement as to the proposal, which often consists merely of adjustments of boundaries oonseqment pn parochial changes;   and in such circumstances it is desirable to avoid the expense of holding an Inquiry.E,S$24th February, 1922.8T163-
N.B. -   This Bill ought to he passed   by the middle of April, since the proposal in the Bill that the qualifying period for the Autumn Register shall expire on the 15th June will involve taking the preliminary steps for the preparation of the Register at the beginning of May,
