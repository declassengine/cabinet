Under the Guardianship of Infants Act,&apos; 1886, this duty was en-trusted to the County Court and the High Court.     The large majority of Courts of summary Jurisdiction are composed of lay Justices, who have little legal knowledge,, but under this Bill they would be required to try questions requiring the nicest discretion and in many cases involving difficult points of law,20,8,23.8T146
