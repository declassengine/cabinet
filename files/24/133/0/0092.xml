/IfiP[ia Document, la the Property of Hia Britannic Majesty1 a Government)..3790.CABIM3T.Copy Ho.*50FOOT AND MOUTH LIBBASS.Memorandum by the guy, col lor of the Exchequer.While I regret the necessity for the very heavy expenditure olved in coping with the present outbreak of Foot and Mouth ease, I must strongly oppose tlie suggestion in the Memoranda the Minister of Health and the Minister of Agriculture and herles&quot; that the statutory arrangements for the division of this expenditure between the Exchequer and Local Authorities should novfc fupset to the disadvantage of the Exchequer.I   In the first place, I may say that assuming the total expendi-e to amount to  700,000, the Local Taxation Account will only required to provide finally for tlie excess in each year over the minimun grant of  140,000 provided under the Diseases of Animals  . , 1894.     Thus, If the expenditure in the current year amounts  450 , 000 * the balance of  250,000 failing into next year, the nt to be provided by the Local Taxation Account will be 10,000 for this year and  110,000 next year.    These sums will wever be increased by any expenditure en Swine Fever up to a slimma of about  40,000 In each yeaJSAs to the equity of throwing this admittedly heavy charge on sal Funds, I would invite reference to the history of our troat-nt of Cattle Diseases,     Before the Contagious Diseases (Animals) t, 1890, tho cost of dealing with Cattle Diseases fell almost tirely on Local Rates, the only compensation chargeable to the tes being that in respect cf Cattlo Plague,    At that time pleuro-3umonia seems to have been the serious trouble and the policy of slaughter
slaughter was generally followed, but for Foot and Mouth Disease the general policy seeems at first to have been to restrict movement rather than to slaughter, though the Privy Council had power to order slaughter in the case of these and other diseases, compensation being payable from the Local Rates.

The Act of 1890 dealt with pleuro-pneuomina only, and set up the cattle pleuro-pneuomina Account into which were to be paid such sums as Parliament might determine, not exceeding £140,000 in any one year to meet the cost of dealing with the disease in Great Britain. It was provided that if in any financial year the money in the Account was insufficient to meet this cost, the Local Taxation Account should find such additional sums as might be necessary.

It is true that in the course of the Debate in this Act Mr Chaplin stated that he had "every reason to hope that the risk of calling upon local resources will be very remote", but the Earl of Jersey in the Lords made it quite clear that. "If the expenditure should be more than £140,000 in any year the Board will meet the deficiency out of the Local Taxation Accounts". Thus, each year was to be considered by itself, and the Exchequer was not to be expected to meet the cost of a serious epidemic in one year by providing £140,000 a year for a number of years.


S?he suggestion of a contrary intention of ?avlla* raont made in the metaeraadnia of the Mlnte-Ur ^Agrie^fcare^ and tflsherles has I think no foundation In tha^rtglnal *0r** ooedlngs.      It la true that no charge has as yet fallen finally on the Local taxation Accounts, but this has been due, I gather, to the w^ual^ej^.j!j41*a**.jaK^-^&amp;tin&amp;^axae*d*4L  140. GOO is any great *As already stated, the Aot of 18$0 only applied to pleturo-pnemcsiia, aad it was not xuxtil 4. years-.1st ar that the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894,- barged .oa. the Cattle Pleuro-pneumonia Aooount the cost nt dealing with Foot and Jgouth Disease ao&amp; Swine Fever under a policy of slaughter.  At the BiM&amp; time, no Increase was made in the statutory jsaxlmm of the &quot;exchequer Grant Of  140*000 aid this wag not ttnre&amp;so&amp;sble seeing that the liability of compensating for S*oot and Mouth Disease and Swine fever had previously been wholly a looal obarge.     In other words, the Act of 1894 relieved Local&apos; Authorities of this liability only to the extant of any money that was available out of the  140,000 Or&amp;nt after dealing with Cattla ?leuro-]?neufaOnia. j*&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; la already stated&apos;, the isaxlcsia provision for Great -Britain of  140,000 has been sufficient for dealing with out-breaks of Foot and kouth Disease for each year up to the pre-&quot;sent, though the corresponding limit of about  40,000 for the extent to which the total provision could be drawn upon for Swine fever has been frequently operative,    1 do not think it is reasonable that the fact of no claim having been aa&amp;e on the Local taxation Account for     years should be quoted as an argument against meeting such claims when they do accrue.     In any case the effect on the rates of any Local Authority, either this year or next year, is not likely to/be/
be appreciably in excess of one halfpenny in the £.

The Minister of Health before in the penultimate paragraph of his memorandum to the provision in the Act of 1894 that any surplus standing to the credit of the Cattle Pleuro-Pneumonia Account should be paid into the Local Taxation Account, and claims that the absence of any payment in the past makes it a hardship on Local Authorities to require them to bear any deficiency now. In my view this arrangement was instituted when it was expected that adjustment between the Exchequer and the Account would be made in the year in which the expenditure was actually incurred. As epidemics of this Kind cannot be foreseen at the time when the Estimates are prepared, in adjustment of this Kind would have led to the Local Taxation Account being finally charged with the excess expenditure in any year over the money actually provided in the Estimates, which would almost always have been much less than the maximum of £140,000. It appears to have been thought a more equitable way of carrying out the intention of the Act that the adjustment between the Exchequer and the Local Taxation Account should be made in the year succeeding that in which the expenditure was incurred, with the result that the Exchequer has provided the exact sum required to discharge its statutory liability and consequently no surpluses have arisen, while on the other hand in no year has a final charge come upon the local Taxation Account by reason of the omission to make adequate provision in the Estimates of the year.

I need only add that the imposition of the whole of this unforeseen expenditure of £700.000 on the Exchequer in the formation year 1922/23 would represent a serious addition


 dition to the liabilities which I have already to provide for in the coming Budget. I am aware of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation of 1901 and of the similar Departmental Committee of 1914 in favour of placing this charge wholly upon the Exchequer, but I would also invite reference to the statement of that Committee that in considering the distribution of burdens between the tax-payer and the ratepayer "considerable" imporatance must also "be attached to the state for the time being of the national finances" (cd. 7315 par.51). Since the Committee reported rates have practically doubled, but Government grants have trebled and taxation has increased sixfold. Would those bodies have made such a recommendation in present circumstances?
