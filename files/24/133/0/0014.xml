SECRET.SirIndia Office, Whitehall, 21st September 1921.In the Military Requirements Committee held in India under the presidency of Lord Rawlinson the question of the Indianisation of the Indian Army loomed so largely that the Committee dealt with this question in addition to the terms of reference laid down for them.It is also understood that the Army Council are desirous that this question should be discussed by Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s Committee, since various questions of amalgamation of British and Indian services are affected thereby.A paper on the subject by the Secretary, Military Department, India Office, is attached for circulation to Members of that Committee.The paper is forwarded for consideration generally. It should be clearly understood that the Secretary of State for India has not approved, indeed he has not yet considered, the proposals contained in it.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,The Secretary,Committee of Imperial Defence,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1.F. W. Duke.
I.--The Demand for the Indianisation of the Indian Army and the Degree to whichthe Principle has been accepted.1. On 20th August 1917 the Secretary of State for India made the following announcement in the House of Commons:--&quot;The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, with which the Government of India are in complete accord, is that of increasing the association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of sell-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire. They have decided that substantial steps in this direction should be taken as soon as possible .... I would add that progress in this policy can only be achieved by successive stages. The British Government and the Government of India, on whom the responsibility lies for the welfare and advancement of the Indian peoples, must be judges of the time and measure of each advance, and they must be guided by the co-operation received from those upon whom new opportunities of service will thus be conferred, and by the extent to which it is found that confidence can be reposed in their sense of responsibility.&quot;In commenting upon this announcement the following extracts from the Montagu-chelmsford Report are relevant: &quot; In the next place we may discern an ever-growing discontent with measures which were resented as evidence of racial discrimination .... There was the exclusion of Indians from the commissioned ranks of the Army. Indian officers form a separate establishment from the British officers, and the highest and most experienced of the former rank lower than the most junior of the latter. This particular disparity naturally came into special prominence on the outbreak of the war.&quot;&quot; There remains one item the importance of which in the eyes of India outweighs all others. British commissions have for the first time been granted to Indian officers .... The services of the Indian Army in the war and . the great increase in its numbers make it necessary that a considerable number of commissions should now be given.&quot;2. As an earnest of their good faith Government decided to allocate vacancies at Sandhurst each term lor Indians. In addition arrangements were made during the war to grant commissions, as a special measure, to a few selected Indians who were actually serving as Indian officers or who had gone through a course of training at Indore.3. On 28th March 1921 members of the Legislative Assembly, commenting on the adecpiacy of these arrangements, drew attention to the fact that in the past two years a total of 25 cadetships only had been awarded, and that, having regard to the declaration of August 191.7 and to the pronouncements made by His Most Gracious Majesty the King,- the right of Indians to higher ranks in the Army should be recognised in a spirit of justice and liberality. It was further pointed out that many Indians dream of the day when the Army will be thoroughly Indianised, as other departments are being Indianised.As a result of this debate, the following resolution was passed by the Legislative Assembly : &quot;That the King-Emperior&apos;s Indian subjects should be freely admitted to all arms of His Majesty&apos;s Military, Naval and Air Forces in India, and the Ancillary Services and the Auxiliary Forces. That every encouragement should be given to Indians, including the educated middle classes, subject to the prescribed standard of fitness, to enter the commissioned ranks of the Army, and that in nominating candidates for the entrance examination unofficial Indians should be associated with the nominating authority ; and in granting King&apos;s commissions, after giving full regard to the claims to promotion of officers of the Indian Army who already hold the commissions of His Excellency the Viceroy, the rest of the commissions granted should be given to cadets trained at Sandhurst. The 5151      150   2.22[This Djcument is the Property of His Britaanic Ma,jesty&apos;s Government.! SECRET.INDIANISATION  OF  THE  INDIAN  ARMY.
general rule in selecting candidates for this training should be from the cotn-munities which furnish recruits, and as far as possible in proportion to the numbers in which they furnish such recruits.&quot;That not less than 2b per cent, of the King&apos;s commissions granted every year should be granted to His Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects to start with.&quot;-A. Immediately following on this resolution two further resolutions were passed dealing with the methods by which the Indianisation of the Army should be put into effect.These resolutions read as follows : &quot;That adequate facilities should be provided in India for the preliminary training of Indians to lit them to enter the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.&quot;&quot;That as soon as funds be available steps should be taken to establish in India a military college such, as Sandhurst, and the desirability of establishing in India training and educational, institutions for other branches of the Army should be steadily kept in view.&quot;5. Apart from the principle of ludianisation and the methods by which it should be introduced, the Legislative Assembly passed a further resolution in relation to the scale of pay of Indian commissioned officers to the following effect :  &quot; This Assembly recommends to the Governor-General in Council that in the interests of economy, and in view of the likelihood of the growth of the Indian element in the commissioned ranks, it is essential that before vested interests arise the pay of all commissioned ranks in all branches of the Army should be fixed on an Indian basis, with an overseas allowance in the case of British officers, and with a similar allowance for Indian officers holding the King&apos;s commission when serving overseas.&quot;II.- The Demand for Indianisation culminates in the Eecommendations of the Military Requirements Committee assembled under the Presidency of Lord Rawlinson.The above expressions of Indian opinion regarding the Indianisation of the Indian Army are reiterated in a definite form and in greater detail in the Report of the Military Requirements Committee, which sat in India, with His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief as President This Committee, whose recommendations were unanimous, declared &quot;that responsibility for defence is the natural corollary of self-government,&quot; and recommended publication of a definite policy of gradual Indianisation as a means of removing the existing feeling of resentment and of reorganising Indian nationhood. The Committee added that the realisation, that India is to have a greater and increasing share in the responsibility for her own defence will enable the taxpayer to shoulder the burden, of high military expenditure more cheerfully and willingly.Ill-The Committee Recommendations summarised.Summarised, the proposals may briefly be stated to be somewhat as follows : (a) An announcement of policy in respect of the Indianisation of the Army to be made at an early date.(6) Thar., responsibility for defence being accepted as the natural corollary of self-guvernmem, a policy should be adopted which will render India more and more self-supporting in matters of defence, i.e., as far as officers are concerned, the gradual elimination of the British element, and the substi-tution of Indians.(c) With this object in view, Indians to be freely admitted to commissions in all branches of the Indian Army at once, the number of such commissions granted in the first instance being at least 25 per cent, of the total number of commissions granted each year, and increasing by 2i- per cent, per annum:That the held of selection should be widened with a view to the^inclusion of the professional and middle classes. ((./) For the time being these candidates to go through a course at Sandhurstprior to obtaining a commission, (cj An Indian Military College to be started as soon as funds are available, acourse at this institution  being considered the equivalent cf a course atthe Royal Military College.
IV.-The difficulty of giving- effect to the Recommendations as they stand and some piobable Results that would follow such a coursj, if adopted.Before examining the possibility and desirability of giving effect to theses proposals in the form in which they are presented in the Committee&apos;s recommenda-tions, it is necessary to touch briefly upon existing conditions as regards the Army in India : (1) Firstly, it may be submitted that, whatever be the status of India, the defence of the country, both as regards external aggression and internal disorder, must be assured; for this, efficient military forces of a certain strength are necessary.(2) At present the safety of India is provided for by Crown forces, partly British and partly fndian, officered by British officers holding commissions in His -Majesty&apos;s land forces; the whole being paid for from Indian revenues.Moreover, India depends on England for assistance as regards material and for considerable reinforcement in certain eventualities.In the Indian portion of this Army, certain units, particularly the Ancillary Services, contain an element of British other ranks. This personnel has hitherto been found by volunteers from the British Army or by borrowing soldiers from the fighting units.This system failed during the war, and owing to the large increase in technical services, India has been compelled to ask the War Office to provide more British personnel for the Ancillary Services, and already men are being ordered to join.The effect of the proposal to Indianise these services directly affects this and is dealt with in detail later.(3) Experience in the past, from the earliest days of our wars in India up to the most recent times, tends to justify the opinion that a large influx of Indians as officers in place of British officers may have a detrimental effect upon the efficiency of the military machine upon which India depends for her safety.Without multiplying instances in support of this assertion, it may be stated, as being a generally accepted fact, that during the Great War of 1914-18 Indian troops showed a tendency to deteriorate seriously and quickly after the loss of their British leaders, few, if any, Indians apparently having the natural aptitude for leadership possessed by the average Englishman.Moreover, after dealing for one year with specially selected Indian material at the Training School for Indian Cadets at Indore, established during the war, the Commandant in his final report expressed the opinion that Indians could never altogether replace the British officer, and that their admission to the Army would not add to the efficiency of the Army.It is an unfortunate fact that the fighting races of India, from which, the Indian Army is recruited, are the very classes who are most backward as regards education, and on the other hand those classes whose educational qualifications are the highest are generally regarded as lacking in martial qualities.From the above it follows that, although the policy of Inclianisation of all the public services may be accepted, the greatest care must be exercised in the application of this principle to the Army, and tiiat therefore the progress of Inclianisation in that particular service cannot but be slower than in the case of other Government services..(4) There are reasonable grounds, therefore, for supposing that in proportion to the number of Indians substituted for British officers, a loss of efficiency within the Army is to be anticipated, thereby constituting, in varying degree, an element of danger to the security of India and an increased burden upon the War Office, who are responsible for reinforcing India in certain eventualities.
(5) It is submitted that the proposal to introduce a large number of Indians as officers holding King&apos;s commissions, and as such having powers of command over British officers and British troops, is one which is encompassed with difficulties.In the first place it is understood that the War Office will be most reluctant to admit the liability of British personnel to serve under Indian officers, even though holding the King&apos;s commission. &apos; - &quot; Though it is possible that the legal position of the War Office is open1 to-question, under Army Act, section 71, and Royal Warrant as amended by Army Order 351 of 1917, it is doubtful whether it would be wise to insist on the liability of British personnel to serve under Indians, particularly as the innovation of granting commissions to Indians was introduced without any specific announcement being made as to the effect this would have on the conditions of service of officers and men of the British Army.Moreover, it may with reason be anticipated that the imposition of this liability will affect the recruiting market, and will result in a demand for terms such as would place recruitment for the British Army beyond the scope of practical politics, a prospect which the War Office cannot be expected to face with equanimity. . - . Apart from this, it is considered most unlikely that the British officer will, ever serve willingly and contentedly under Indians who happen to be his seniors in rank. This does not necessarily imply any anti-Indian feeling against the Indian as such, but is purely the outcome of that national trait, the possession of which by most Englishmen has been largely responsible for EnglancFs. pre-eminent position as a World Power, and certainly lor the winning and maintenance of her position in India.Many officers at present serving in the Indian Army would remain because they themselves have attained a certain seniority or because they could not afford to go, but it can scarcely be anticipated that the increase of the Indian element will have anything but a serious effect upon the recruitment of officers for the Indian Army in the future.&apos;(6)&apos; Furthermore;-although a closer fusion and co-operation between the Home and the Indian Service is desirable in many respects, and is desired by most officers, the proposals will have the effect of alienating the Home from the Indian Service, and will render impossible the amalgamation of branches of the Service such as the Royal Army Service Corps and the Supply and Transport Corps.In addition, one-of the first results of the Indianisation of the Ancillary Services will be to stop the supply of British personnel to these services, owing to the refusal on the part of the War Office to admit the obligation of British personnel to serve under Indians.    This implies either that the : British element will be completely eliminated or that volunteers must be engaged upon special terms, which will include the liability to serve under -    Indians.   It may be imagined that such terms will be more expensive. (7): It must be admitted that the proposals constitute a long step forward on the part of India towards Dominion status, seeing that underlying  them is evidently the idea of an Indian Army from which the British element shall in - ,    time have been almost if not entirely eliminated.   If this be accepted, it is obvious, as the War Office will assuredly point out, that whatever measures are carried out must be so formulated as to result in conditions analogous to those existing in the other Dominions.Briefly this implies that a Military College established in India must be on a par with the Military Colleges of the Dominions, such as Kingston, and Duntroon, and that the graduates of any such college must receive Dominion commissions and not lving&apos;s commissions. The validity of this argument is not easy to refute, and once admitted a further difficulty arises regarding the admission of Indians as officers in the present Indian Army, for with Dominion commissions they would normally have no authority over officers and men of the Crown forces,To give effect to the Committee&apos;s recommendations in their present form therefore appears to be impracticable; but as the promises of Government &apos;   on this head, already referred to, render some action imperative, it is &apos; &quot;necessary to find some other solution.
5151BV.-Factors to be considered in tho formulation of an alternative Scheme.1. Though the attainment&apos;of self-government postulates responsibility for self-defence, the importance of India within the Empire demands that the security of the country shall be assured, until India is herself in a position to assume full responsibility for defence.in the meantime this duty must be performed by Imperial forces, i.e., the existing Grown forces now in India, and it may be that their presence will prove to be necessary for some time after Tndia has actually attained Dominion status.This need in no way detract from the dignity of India as a self-governing Dominion, for it is to be remembered that it is a phase of development through which other Dominions, such as Canada and South Africa, have arrived at the position in which they now find themselves.2. Although the evidence given before the Military Requirements Committee shows that amongst politically-minded Indians the idea of Iuclianisation of the Army is one which has attained great prominence, our experiences in the past justify a certain degree of scepticism as to whether this demand is shared by the bulk of the people to au extent indicated by the political cry, and whether Indians of the right stamp and qualifications will really be forthcoming.Indians can doubtless produce arguments to show why the response on the part of young Indians to the opportunities for a military career already thrown open to them is so poor, but the fact remains that from the whole of India only about 70 applicants appeared in Simla for selection for cadetships at Indore, though at that time the war was in progress, and that considerable difficulty is experienced in finding suitable candidates to fill the vacancies allotted to Indians at Sandhurst.3. However, as this is a point which is open to argument, Indians must be given a fair chance of proving their earnestness in this respect and every assistance in proving that they are capable of playing their part if given the opportunity.The Indian demand may be described as one for &quot; equal status,&quot; and though it may not be feasible to grant this, they should undoubtedly be given equal opportunity.&quot;4. In view of the justifiable misgivings as to the reality of the demand, outside purely political circles, and considering the importance to the Empire of the security of India., it is submitted that any scheme which is formulated with a view to meeting Indian aspirations should be such as to give Indians their full opportunity, and thereafter place upon them the onus of proof as regards their desire and capacity to make full and effectual use of that opportunity.5. Another point which cannot be ignored is that as yet comparatively few Indians have acquired the sentiment of nationality. Doubtless it is an idea which has grown rapidly in the past few years, but events of the day clearly show that with the mass of the people the yoke of a caste system, borne for centuries, and religious and linguistic differences are factors which still outweigh the spirit of nationhood.This, therefore, is a point which must be taken into account in any scheme of Indianisation of the service.(6) Briefly, then, a solution must be found which will. (a) satisfy the demands of moderate Indians ;(b) involve the smallest element of danger as regards the internal and externalsectirity of India ;(c) cause the  smallest  amount  of disorganisation  of present  arrangementscompatible with the principles involved ;(d) cause the smallest dislocation possible within the cadre of British officers,and be generally acceptable to the British Service, without whose support no scheme is possible ;(e) give Indians their opportunity, and throw upon them the onus of provingtheir willingness and capacity to avail themselves of it ; (/) be easily adaptable to the conditions of the future when India shall have attained Dominion status.VI-An alternative Scheme based upon the above Factors.After careful consideration of the case in all its aspects, it is submitted that the best solution of this difficult problem is to be found in the immediate formation of the nucleus of a dominion force for India, into which all Indians receiving commis-sions in the future will be gazetted with Dominion commissions granted by the Governor-General in India.
Such a step merely anticipates the demand, which will inevitably be made sooner or later, for the conversion of the Indian portion of the Army from a Urown or regular basis to a Dominion or, local basis. It gives to India an opportunity for preparing gradually to assume responsibility for her own defence.It serves as a guarantee of Governments intention to recognise full Dominion Status, which should be acceptable to all Indians.It obviates the many difficulties with which the proposal to Indianise the present-Indian Army is encompassed.VII.-Two methods of establishing the Nucleus of a Dominion Force for India.To effect the establishment of a Dominion force only two methods present, themselves:  (a) The immediate conversion of all Indian Army units into local units ; and (6) The gradual formation of a local force unit by unit.Of the above (a) is open to many objections : - (1) It is too radical a change. (2) The infiltration,&apos;iir an ever increasing flow, of Indians into every unit of what is now the Indian Army would possibly have a detrimental effect simultaneously on the efficiency of the whole of that Army upon which for many years India must depend for her security, whether it be a Crown or Dominion force. &apos; &apos;By increased efforts the British officers would probably, up to a certain point, maintain a fair degree of efficiency, and the loss would not be apparent until put to the crucial test of war. (3) It would affect the position of all the British officers in the Indian Army, who would find themselves in a position in which only two courses would be open to them. They would either have to surrender their commissions in Ills l\lajesty&apos;s land forces, and take new commissions in the Indian local forces, or to retain their commissions in His Majesty s land forces and continue to serve in the new Indian local forces as volunteers.It is highly improbable that any would accept the first alternative. In practice the second would mean their reversion to the British Service, as this would now constitute the only Crown force extant; and, although they might still be retained on a separate list for promotion, their position as volunteers would be insecure and unsatisfactory.In a similar manner all the British personnel of the Ancillary Services woukl be alrected, and these men, who form the backbone of many of these services and in some are indispensable (skilled mechanics, &amp;c), would either disappear altogether or only be obtainable on prohibitive terms.(-1) Even the Indian ranks wotdd be affected and would presumably have to be reattested as volunteers to serve in the Dominion instead of the Crown forces.The second method (6) offers the following advantages :  d(I.) It results in a minimum disorganisation of the present Indian Army, whichwould remain intact in its present form and efficiency, available for thedefence of India.(2) It causes the minimum dislocation within the cadre of British officers, as the : position of those serving at present would be assured, and it would give time for the future supply to be regulated according to future needs. (3) It further ensures the safety of India bv giving time for the thorough, testing of the Dominion force unit by unit, before a reduction in the Imperial forces is made, but at the same time gives to Indians the opportunity which they desire.(4) It obviates the difficulty with regain] to securing the services of British personnel, without which the Ancillary Services would be seriously crippled..VIII.-Recommendations. It is therefore recommended that (M It should be announced immediately that Government has decided upon the-formation of the nucleus of a Dominion force for India with a view to fulfilling the promises made by the Government and in order to enable Indians to prepare for the day when, having attained Dominion status, India will assume full responsibility for her own defence. ..o!
(2) Thai the guiding principle in the formation of such a force should be that-the present Indian Army is to be a gradually diminishing force in proportion as the Dominion Army is a gradually increasing force.(3) That in the first instance the establishment of one complete military forma-tion, such as a brigade of all arms with Ancillary Services, be aimed %t-That the progressive increase in number of the Dominion force units anil corresponding decrease in the Crown forces in India shall be considered in relation to the number of the Dominion units proved to have attained a degree of efficiency which will admit of their substitution in place of units of the Crown forces, and not depend merely upon the number of Indian aspirants to commissions.It is recognised that this brigade would have to be surplus to the minimum military requirements of India, and would consequently he an additional charge on the Budget.(4) That the Dominion force should be formed unit by unit by raising new Dominion units from the many demobilised soldiers now in India and voluntary transfers from regular Indian units; a corresponding decrease taking place in the regular Indian units as each Dominion unit is proved efficient to replace them or when the military authorities in India consider that the military situation admits.(5) That, in order to ensure a proper test of efficiency, Dominion units should be permanently embodied, should be associated with Imperial units in training manoeuvres, &amp;c, ami finally do a tour of duty on the frontier as far as possible under service conditions.(6) These tentative Dominion forces to be under the command of the Military Authorities of the time.(7) That officers for the Dominion units should be obtained as follows : (a) British officers  (a gradually decreasing element).    As volunteersseconded from the Imperial to the Dominion Army.(b) Indian officers (a gradually increasing element): (1) From amongst those Indians already holding King&apos;s commissions as volunteers.(2) From selected Indian officers now holding Yiceroy&apos;s commissions (as subaclars, &amp;c.) in the Indian Army as volunteers.(3) From future graduates of the Royal Military College Sandhurst  until an Indian Military College is established.(4) Finally, from graduates of the Indian Military College when established.Officers of category (1) are a small body. They might be allowed to go permanently to the Dominion force as volunteers, taking a Dominion instead of a Kiog&apos;s commission, or retain their King&apos;s commission and be seconded for duty with the Dominion force on the same, terms as British officers, should they not elect to remain in the regular Indian. Army. sOfficers in categories (2), (3), and (4) to receive Dominion commissions. Under King&apos;s Regulations, as amended by Army Order 230/1919, it appears that these Dominion officers would take rank with officers of the regulars within the permanent Indian forces according to the date of their respective ranks. They would also, presumably, take rank with British officers of the regular forces in India, but would have no power to exercise command over British troops. In the case of Dominion officers this power of command was granted during the war under London. Gazette notifications of 1st May and 3rd November 1915.(8) That in view of the present lack of a national spirit in India, and on the-assumption that a Dominion (i.e., National) Army, to be efficient, must be-imbued with a spirit of patriotism and duty towards the State, the education of Indian boys, who aspire to be officers, should commence at an early age at a Military School where those qualities essential to the making of a good officer would be inculcated.It may be stated without fear of contradiction that these qualities are,, as a ride, not to be found in the Indian youth of the present day.A.
