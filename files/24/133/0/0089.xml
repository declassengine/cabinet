[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  March H)22.CRET.j?.P. 3787.CABINET.SPECIAL WEEKLY  REPORT ON UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 59.WEEK ENDED FEBRUARY 24, 1922THE  SITUATION.There are still no signs of a general trade revival. Employment in coal-mining is rather better. More men have been reabsorbed, and more regular time is being worked. The slight improvement recorded in the iron and steel industry continues, but there is no evidence that the improvement will be maintained in the near future. In shipbuilding and marine engineering prospects are very bad, though there is still some activity in ship-repairing i Employment in the cotton industry is still far below the normal, but there are slight signs of improvement. The woollen industry continues to improve slowly. Employment in the hosiery trade remains good. General engineering shows no improvement except in the motor and cycle section, in which the slight improvement recorded has been maintained. Employment in the tinplate trade remains the same. The building trade shows no signs of improvement except in &quot;house decoration.&quot; The boot and shoe industry remains the same. Employment in the tanning industry of Lancashire remains good.T. J. MACNAMARA,Ministry of Labour.

[From Autumn 1920 to Autumn 1921.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee.   ,The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.[This Committee has since been in constant session and has, up to the 24th February, 1922, held 42 meetings.The problem of unemployment in one form or another has also been before the Cabinet on 58 occasions between the 13th August, 1920, and the 24th February, 1922.](A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Bill of general scope wras passed into law on the 9th August, 1920, and came into operation on the 8th November following. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit and the amount thereof Avhich could be drawn. Contributions were also increased and authority given to borrow money from the Treasury up to  20,000,000.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit during the period November 8, 1920, to February 18, 1922.Source of Contribution.Amount.Employers....

(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1021 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 128,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits and Trade Facilities Act schemes (see table below).SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED AT FEBRUARY 17, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABOVE.Scheme	Number Employed in Greater London.
