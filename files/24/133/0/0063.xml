(This document is the property of &quot;His -BritanaicwMajtrsty5^ Gov^-nment-).CABINET.37 61   ) eJJ ADMISSION TO THIS COUNTRY^OF. RUSSIAN-CHILDREN-.f Memorandum hy. the Home Secretary.&quot;The fellowship of Reconciliation&quot;t which is the British Section of 3The International Secretariat of the Movement towards a Christian International.&quot;., haaone of the famine areas in Russia, probably the area in whioh the Friends Relief Mission is operating,     The immediate proposal is that a party of 250 children, selected from those who are in grave danger cf starvation if 3.eft in Russia without relief,, should be brought to this oountry end distributed to the homesof persons who are willing to keep them for a period.     It is contemplated that they would be sent baok to their own homes in about a year,,     The organiaerc of the movement say that the Russian,  Finnish,   Norwegian and Swedish Governments have undertaken to transport the children free of charge, and that by this method they aro able to tap a source of charity not otherwise available, since a oertain number of people are willing to keep a child in their own home but cannot oontribufce sufficient to maintain a child in Russia.     They also urge that the soheme 13 an object lesson in fellowship among nations.The Ministry of Health deprecate the admission of these children becavtoe of the danger of introducing infectious diseases into this country.     Smallpox is prevalent almost throughout Russia.; typhus is widespread;   there have been recent outbreaks of choloraP and there have been reports of plague,     Repatria-tion of emigrants and refugees from Russia is known to have exerted a very unfavourable influenoe cn health conditions in PolandaIf the Government should decide to admit these children, the Ministry of Health would require conditions to be observed as set out in the paper attached, I have shown a oopy of these conditions to the representatives of the Intei-na-tional Secretariat j. and they tell me that they are prepared to comply with the conditions and will undertake to do all that is required by the Ministry to safe-guard the health of this country,,The acoeptanoe of these 0onditions willt of course, reduoe, though it willright to take this risk, having regard to the very small effeot whioh the offer of hospitality to 250 children can have on the distress prevailing in Russia, It must be remembered that the ohildren will come to Nevroastle-upon-Tyne and serious industrial and oommeroial issues would be raised by the Introduction of infectious diseases into this port.I should add that the proposal to bring Russian children to thia country when first put forward was in an incomplete form, and I rettc-aed an unfavc^table&apos; answer.     This oalled forth a oertaan number of pr-area&quot;a and it is oleer that, if the r^vhe-me-r.-.w pat forward     is frustrated,, there will be oomiderable oritieisa of the Gc^ernrcentce action.,     Lord important-mccr ho a already given notice&apos;applied for permission to bring to this country Russian ohildreh selected fromnot entirely remove, the risk of health, and it is a question whether it is
that he will raise the natter in the House of Lords.The International Secretariat ought in fairness to be laformed at once whether their request will be granted or refused and I ask that the matter may receive the early consideration of the Cabinet. I do not think that this ia a matter whioh I ought to deoide without consulting my colleagues,S.S.20th February, 1922
