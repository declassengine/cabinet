OH THE SITuATION Df. IRVUm JOB TOES EHDI.HQ 25TH FEBFOJARY 1922,,(Circulated by the Secretary of State for Vfar).1,     Ho moves of troops In Ireland have boen carried out daring tho past week.As already reported the evacuation of the Cavalry Regiment (Tho Carabiniers and 1st Royal Dragoons) is being carried out this week In addition to several disbanded R.A.S.C. and R,E.Uniio,2,     In Dublin, and to a lesser extent elsewhere, members of the I.R.A, are appearing In uniform in the&quot;streets, at the Opera and at other places of entertainment*     These men presumably belong to that portion of the I,R,A, which supports the Provisional Government, though not one man among them, if asked, would adult that he belonged to any other organisation than the Irish Republican Army.     The Guard at the Bank of Ireland was taken over yesterday by a detachment of this force    Rapid promotion and multiplicity of titles appear to be&quot;the order of tho day in the new Irish Military organisation.     Commandants General who were never heard of until after the &quot;Truce&quot; on the 11th July, are now frequently met with, and Colonels Commandants and. even Major Generals are now beginning to appear.     One/ J,Ea&quot;Dalton, a young man of apparently some 25.years, who took Mr. Duggan&apos;s place as Chief Liaison Officer, has now blossomed into a Major General!3,     The Liaison Commission established in accordance with orders from the Cabinet has now been operating since 21st February 1922, and has covered a good deal of ground along the border4As far as the Commission on the Southern side of the border is concerned, useful work has been done in one or two minor matters - e.g. the return of a&apos;confiscated&quot;motor, and the arrest of the writer of a threatening letter.     One or two matters have been referred through Mr. Cope at Dublin&apos; Castle to the Provisional Government, such as the arrange-ments for members of the Commission to cross the border, and arrangements for notifying;- the fact of the existence and functions of the Liaison Commission to their represen-tatives on this 3ide of the border.Copies of all reports rendered by the British members of the Commission have been forwarded to the Secretary of State for War,     Briefly the situation on the border may be summed up as follows:-
(a) There is no fear of any incursions or raids from Northern Ireland into the area for which the Provisional Government is responsible,(b) There 13 vory grave danger of raids from Southern Ireland into Northern Ireland as long as. and whenever, Sinn Fein prisoners are held in Northern Gaols, Irrespective of whether they have ootamittod offences or not.     The Provision-al Government members of tho Southern Commission though they say that such raids would bo tho&apos;work of irresponsible Individuals, are obviously doing nothing to control their   4 subordinatesj and are using their attitude as a threat to secure compliance with their demands.     Tho Secretary of State has boen informed of this.(c) If raids as mentioned in (b) take place, retaliatory action on the part of the Northernsi3 quite possible.In other words the followers (if not the actual members) of the Provisional Government are holding a pistol to the head of tho Northern Government and possibly of tho Provisional Government itself.Such a situation is bound to occur whenever: responsible Governments submit to the dictation of organisations which are bound by no considerations of law, morals or civilised custom.(Signed) &apos;   C.F.N, MACREADY;GENERAL- Commanding-in-Chief&apos;, IRELAND,, Ireland,8th February 1922,
