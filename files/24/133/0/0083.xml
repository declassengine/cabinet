This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.SECRET.- 18CP. 3781.THE CABINET.IRAQ.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.With reference to my recent memorandum (OP. 3717) on the future of the Mosul garrison, I circulate a telegram which has been received from General Haldane.L. W.-E.The War Office,25th February, 1922.From the General Officer Commanding, Iraq, to the War Office.20th February, 1922.   Your No. 90403 D.M.O.,-7th February.I consider that retention of present garrison at Mosul until 31st May, if desired, would not entail any risk. I could even reinforce it with a battalion from Baghdad to counter any Turkish menace should such be made. Tribes are occupied with agriculture until well into June, and at present outlook is peaceable. Its retention, however, will mean keeping for supply and transport duties some 1,500 (?) personnel, who would otherwise be available for repatriation, and will consequently involve considerable additional expense for which no provision has been made in Estimates for next year.(B22/87)   100  2/22  H&amp;S, Ltd.   9708wo
