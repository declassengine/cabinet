[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1922.SECRET.REPLY TO THE WAR OFFICE PROPOSAL TO ABSORB THE MILITARY FUNCTIONS OF THE AIR MINISTRY (CP.-3681).MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.I AM compelled to lay before my colleagues, as shortly as I may, my views on CP.-3681 by the Secretary of State for War, on the proposed transfer of the Air Ministry to the War Office.2. I do not know that this perpetual controversy is good for either of the services, or that it leads to anything except discord; but since the Secretary of State for War has again attacked the Air Ministry, it is necessary for me to put forward this short reply.3. I should like to point out that the question of the functions of the air service, and its relations to the naval and military services, were discussed at length in the course of last year, both by memoranda and by discussion before a sub-committee of the C.I.D. under Mr. Balfour&apos;s chairmanship. On that occasion the Admiralty and the War Office had full freedom to argue their case, but they failed to carry Mr. Balfour with them.The results of these discussions were summed up in a paper (C.I.D.-149c) by Mr. Balfour, who stated as his conclusions : (i.) That the Air Force must be autonomous in matters of administration and education;(ii.) That in the case of defence against air raids, the Army and the Navy must play a secondary role; (iii.) That in cases of military operations by land or naval operations by sea,the Air Force should be in strict subordination to the General or Admiralin supreme command; and, lastly, (iv.) That in other cases (such as the protection of commerce, and attack on enemy harbours and inland towns) relations between the Air Force andthe other services should be regarded rather as a matter of co-operationthan that of the strict subordination necessary when aeroplanes are actingmerely as auxiliaries.4. These conclusions were unacceptable to the General Staff, who at once came forward with a long and aggressive statement (C.I.D.-150c) on the general theme of the uselessness of the Air Ministry.5. After the appointment of the Geddes Committee, the War Office renewed their attack (in which they were, I think, joined by the Admiralty) and submitted papers, as I understand, to the Geddes Committee urging the desirability of the re-division of the air service between the War Office and Admiralty. Unfortunately for themselves, their arguments also failed to convince the Geddes Committee. That Committee (see pp. G and 7 of their Report) pointed out that, by dividing the air service between the two senior services, duplication in certain directions would be inevitable, and that there was &apos;&apos; grave danger that, without a separate existence, the air service would be unable to work out developments which might .... entirely revolutionise methods of attack and defence and so render possible very large economies in the cost of the fighting services as a whole . . . .&quot;The paper now put forward by the Secretary of State for War ignores the opinions expressed by the Geddes Committee. .

6. With regard to CP.-3681, the Secretary of State for War again quotes Marshal Foch (as did the C.I.G.S. in another paper, C.I.D.-139c), but he does not quote the later opinion of Marshal Foch in December 1920 :  &quot; The military mind always imagines that the next war will be on the same lines as the last. This has never been the case, and never will be. One of the great factors in the next war will obviously be aircraft, and the potentialities of aircraft attack on a large scale are almost incalculable. But it is clear that such attack, owing to its crushing moral effect on a nation, may impress public opinion to the point of disarming the Government, and thus become decisive.&quot;7. The Secretary of State for War also quotes Sir Douglas Haig as against the formation of the Air Ministry in 1917, but he omits to say that the principle of a separate air service was accepted by the War Office.8. Neither of these quotations is of recent date, and. in view of the rapidity with which conditions change, it would be more appropriate if the Secretary of State for War were to base his case on current opinion.In this connection were the Government presently to adopt the recommendations made by the Secretary of State for War, the world might be faced with the spectacle of Great Britain taking this retrograde step at a time when other countries were learning, by experience, the disadvantages of an air service split up between the other two services. There are ample indications to support this latter contention, and Genera] Pershing himself has very lately expressed in conversation with our delegate at the Washington Conference the opinion that a separate air force will ultimately become inevitable in America.9. The&quot; Secretary of State for War argues that his scheme would save duplication by combining air force and army training schools. Does he propose to train cadets to fly at Sandhurst ? If not, the length of the training, and consequently the expense, would be greater than under the present system. If he does, I should be interested to see how he proposes to do it without considerable expense.10. Finally, I would like to say that economies are more likely to result from willing and sympathetic co-operation between the three services than from the conditions brought about by these constant efforts to create friction and discord by advocating the abolition of the Air Ministry whenever an opportunity presents itself.F. E. G.Air Ministry, February 11, 1922.
