[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.](Printed for the Cabinet.      March 1922.)SECRET.CP. 3795.MOPLABC  RIOTS.XVII.I circulate to my colleagues the following telegrams which have been received from the Viceroy on the subject of the Moplah riots.E. S. M.3rd March 1922.From Viceroy, Home Department, 2Qtli January 1922.Correspondence ending our telegram of the 24th instant. Following telegram has been received from Madras Government, dated 24th January : &quot; Committee to enquire into the deaths of Moplah prisoners in train, in unanimous report, have found one death was due to asphyxia, caused hy confinement in insufficiently ventilated van. Two vans of similar pattern had been nsed for conveyance of over 2,500 prisoners, on 32 different journeys, without mishap, but vans, though similar in pattern, differed in ventilation. Van in which tragedy occurred had gauze covers of windows choked up by paint, and allowed insufficient ventilation for number of prisoners carried in it. Three vans used were sandy (sic) (? ventilated) wagons and not closed trucks, and their use was not objectionable, and implied no inhumanity to prisoners. Their use in circumstances of emergency was undoubtedly justified, but practice should have been kept under better regulation and separate inspection of ventilation of each van made before use. Committee hold that main responsibility for the catastrophe lies with the Railway Company and its local representative, traffic inspector, for failure to see that conveyance supplied was fit for the purpose in view. So far as local subordinate officers, namely, sub-magistrate and police sergeant, are concerned, Committee finds that they were justified in following the practice of using such vans which had been established and continued by superior authority, and that so far as they are concerned acceptance of unsuitable vans was accidental and not due to their negligence. Owing to martial law conditions, some obscurity as to whether superior responsibility lays on the military commander or the special civil officer. Committee finds that arrangements were, in practice, under civil direction, and that the special civil officer should have brought the system of transport under better regulation. Committee also finds the police sergeant guilty of negligence in failing to take note of the condition of prisoners while on the journey. Had he done so, disaster would have been averted, or at least its consequences mitigated.&quot;From Viceroy, Home Department, SQtli January 1922.228 Political. Following telegram received from General Officer Commanding, Madras District, dated 25th January : &quot; Situation 10.00 hours. Abdul Iiaji and four followers took refuse in Hindu temple and declared their intention of fighting. All killed by Suffolks, who captured two firearms and five swords.

If this is correct, we desire respectfully to protest against the procedure adopted, which, as report has not yet been published here, has created awkward situation, and will lead to allegations being made that Government of India arc withholding from the public the report, full text of which they have not yet even received. In the circumstances, we have had to instruct the Government of Madras to publish the report of the Committee immediately. Although our telegram communicating the summary, telegraphed to us by Government of Madras, did not state specifically that report had not been published, you will observe that it was despatched in cypher.From Viceroy, Borne Department, Gtli February 1922.Following telegram received from General Officer Commanding, Madras District. Wellington, dated 3rd : -&quot;Situation 18.00 hours. Four rebels took refuge in house near Villila, and intimated the intention of fighting.

Death sentences confirmed by him in all cases except one, commuted by him transportation for life.From Viceroy, Home Department, 11th February 1922.Moplah rebellion. Reference to your telegram of the 21st ultimo, 316. We think that publication of letter of 24th October, from General Officer Commanding, Madras District, would be a mistake as it would merely tend to provoke criticism and recriminations over question now several months old, to no good purpose. As regards GifforcVs report, that of Knapp&apos;s Committee, summary of which you have received, furnishes complete and authoritative story of occurrence, including cause of death of Deane, by Gifford, and we see therefore no advantage in this and would deprecate-publication of latteFs report..From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 11th February 1922.Madras Government point out that Hindus and others forcibly converted to Muhammadanisrn during the Mapilla rebellion, who subsequently revert to their original religion, will be in. hourly danger of their lives even when normal conditions have been restored, unless something is done to counteract notions on the subject of such reversions now held by majority of ilapillas.   Local religious teachers
have always looked exclusively to Mecca as their religious centre, and Madras Government have been advised by Mapilla expert that most promising means of convincing them that forcible conversion is illegal, and an insult to Islamic religion only to be wiped out by allowing converts freely and fearlessly to rejoin their own faith, would be a fatwa from Ulemas of Mecca, endorsed by Hussein as Sherif. Would it be possible to approach Hussein for fatwa on above lines ?From Viceroy, Home Department, \lth February 1922.Continuation of our telegram of the -1th instant. Moplah train tragedy. Following telegram, dated 7th, received from Madras Government: &quot;A full copy of the report of the Committee is being sent by post, with a copy of the interrogation to which the Madras Government consider it necessary to obtain replies before formulating orders on the report.   Orders are thus delayed unavoidably.&quot;From Viceroy, Home Department, lQtk February 1922.38-1 Pol. Continuation our telegram dated 12th February. Following is report on situation in Malabar for the week ending 12th February. Situation generally much the same as last week. Ten armed rebels killed in Hindu temple in Mellattur area, and live in Tiruraugadi area. Konnara Tangal and Avoker Musalliar still in south-east Calicut Taluk ; former reported very fanatical. Restoration of normal conditions progressing slowly.From Viceroyi Home Department,. 22nd February 1922.Continuation our telegram dated 15th February. Following is report on situation in Malabar for the week ending 19th February. The Konnara Tangal and Avoker Mussaliar are still in hills to the south-east of Calicut Tulak, but with decreasing following. Many rebels have been arrested in that area and a few killed. South of Beypore river nothing important has occurred. The 9th Gurkha Rifles, 2nd Battalion, left on Saturday. With decline of martial activity has grown vociferation in Calicut and elsewhere, with much exaggeration about distress in Ernad, which has suffered most. Recent sales of markets and liquor shops attracted good competition and fetched good prices. There is heavy road traffic in areca nuts, ginger, cocoanuts, timber, and even paddy. Agricultural operations are in fair progress in many amsons, and new teashops are to be seen everywhere. Prices are not unduly high. The continued absence of the Janmis is the great handicap to better progress in reconstruction.From Viceroy, Army Department, 28th February 1922.313. Martial law is being withdrawn from Malabar District. It is not intended, to forward any more telegraphic or written summaries of situation.
