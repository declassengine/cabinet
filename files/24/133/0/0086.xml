DOCUMENT IS THE. PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S government cabinet. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. Memorandum by Minister of Labour.1, in my reoent memoranda to the Cabinet (CP,3689 and cp, 3724) I pointed out that the position with regard to Unemployment made it imperative to look ahead and determine a connected policy in regard to the treatment of Unemployment Insurance,2. We have just authorised an extension of benefit for a further six weeks at the current rates, but subject to oertain limitations.   This extension oarries us up to April 5th, by which time exhaustion of Benefit will begin.   In each week thereafter an increasingly large number of men and women will be out of Benefit,3, There are at present in Great Britain over 1,800,000wholly unemployed and 260,000 on short time.   It is, of course, extremely diffloult to forecast the probable trend of employ-ment over the next 18 months.   It seems reasonable to suppose that there will be a steady improvement, but I cannot find any support for the view that such improvement is likely to be rapid, and, on the whole, it seems to me that prudence demands that we should base our plans upon the assumption that our present figures may fall to about 1,600,000 by June or July next, and that for at least the ensuing 12 months there may be an average number unemployed up to about 1,500,000 with perhaps an average of 1,300,000 during the period July, 1923 - November, 1923,4, We are now paying Unemployment Benefit at the rateof 15/- to men and 12/- to women.   In addition we are paying grants of 5/- for a wife and l/- for each child under the/Temporary
Temporary Dependants Grants Act of last Session, but these grants are due to cease on May 9th,5*        On July 3rd next a new insurance year and period of benefit begins.   Under the Act the amount of benefit is limited to one week for every 6 contributions paid, and although 25 contributions are to be added free it is clear that owing to the long period of unemployment experienced, many will have not more than a few weeks&apos; benefit to draw, and the great majority will have exhausted benefit long before the winter begins.6.        Finally the Unemployment Fund seems likely almost to exhaust its borrowing powers of  19,000,000 by the end of June or July. 7,        I think we cannot face in present circumstances a large number (running into many hundreds of thousands after the fourth or fifth week) of persons who have exhausted benefit and would be without benefit up to july nor can we rely upon the present arrangements which, as I have indicated, would give only 4 or 5 weeks further benefit commencing in July and terminating long before the beginning of winter, with no provision whatever for ^meeting the winter months,8.        I do not think it Is practicable to stop the Dependants1 Grants principle altogether; the grant of an additional benefit to men with wives and ohildren has met a real need and I do not think we can go back on it.   To continue it, obviously means continuing the contributions at.a level higher than that now provided under the U.I. Acts.9,        The state of the Unemployment Fund renders it necessary in any event to lower the rates of benefit payable under the Unemployment Insurance Aot, and after examining various alternstlve schemes it seems to me that the right way to deal with the situation is to provide for a benefit to married men somewhat lower than the combined benefit which they now/receive
receive under the two schemes, and to pay single men and single women benefits less than they are at present receiving under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.10.       I am advised that to pay these benefits on the scale which in my view, is necessitated by the situation, will mean the continuance of contributions equal to those at present levied under the two sohemes.11.      My colleagues will, I em sure, appreciate the great importance of putting an end. to the practice that has been forced upon us in recent months of going to the House of Commons at short intervals with a new Bill to deal with Unemployment Insurance.     A Bill was passed in August 1920, another in December 1920, another in March 1921, another in July 1921, and still another in November 1921. 12.       I ask for the support of my colleagues to the following proposals in order that we may put before the Bouse and the country a prudent scheme calculated to make reasonably adequate provision for at least the next 10 months.   If, as is to be hoped, our forecasts.about unemployment prove to be wrong, we shall still be justified in our present proposals because we should in that event immediately begin to pay back the money that we have borrowed, thus reducing the debt on the Fund &amp;nfl accelerating the moment at which we can lower the rates of contribution.13.    PROPOSALS.(1) Tho present combined benefits of 20/&apos;- to married men plus l/- for e .ch child to be reduced to 16/-plus 1/- for each child. (2) The present rate of 15/- to single men to bereduced tc 12/-.
(3) The present rate of lid/- to women to &quot;be reduced to 10/-.(4) 10 weeks benefit to be payable in a new &quot;special period&quot;   from 26th April to 31st October 1922   -a period of 27 weeks.     A period of 16 weeks benefit, plus a permissive extension of 10 weeks, to be payable in the following year November 1922, to November 1923.(5) The existing combined contributions to be continued until the debt to the Treasury has been repaid namely:-Men.        Wpmen^ Employer lOd. 8d.Employee 9d. 7d.State .   6-%d. 5ja.Total 2/ l^d        l/8 d.14.      It will be necessary for me to persuade the employers to agree to the continuance of their contributions on the level suggested, because when I obtained their concurrence in the Dependants&apos; Grants scheme last year it was hoped that circumstances would so improve as to render it unnecessary to continue that scheme for more than the six months provided by the Act.15.       I am advised that the edditional State payment over . and above the amount contemplated under the existing Acts for the Financial Year 1922-1923 will be about  5,000,000.        It must be remembered, however, that under the existing Acts no provision whatever is made to cover exhaustions of benefit in the period from 5th April to 1st July,1928, nor do the existing arrangements in practice make adequate provision for the period from July onwards.
16.       I have considered whether it would be practicable to make any change in the present oombined State contribution, which, under my proposals, is very little more than one fourth of the whole;   I think it would be extremely unwise to try to differentiate in this way.   If we take anything off the State contribution we shall be attacked by those representing the other two contributing parties and we may be driven in the end to a scheme more costly to the State. On the other hand, if we can say simply and broadly that the unemployment situation demands the collection of contributions on their present level we shall probably reduoe the attack to a minimum.17.      I ask for authority to prepare and introduce at onoe a Bill embodying these propose-Is.(Sgd) T.J.   MAGNAMARA.Ministry of Labour 27th February,1922.
