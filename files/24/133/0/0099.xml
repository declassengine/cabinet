.OABIHST.THE ELECTORAL SITUATION.Memorandum by the Minister of Health *&quot;tfhd present position in regard to the parliamentary&apos; representation of the electors of this country; I, think., It will be agreed is generally regarded as extremely unsatisfactory. The breakdown of the two party system and the.introduction.of three or four candidates at a large number of el eat ions, a pr aot lee which is likely to extend,produces Parliamentary represent at ion Of a minor It y pi&apos; the votes In an inore&amp;sing number of constituencies. .  The resultant parliamentary&apos; majorities can scarcely claim adequately to express the political feeling of the country * &apos; The growing danger of minorities in the constituencies governing the.country through parliamentary majorities cannot be overstated.. - The present political posit ion, when It ia abundantly clear.that the old historical political rivalry between the conservative and liberal parties In the community ars not only likely to endure but may become even accentuated, may easily result In.a solid, but minority, labour vote in the oountry snatching with disastrous results the reins of&apos;of  ice, at any. rate, for.a time. It would, therefore, appear urgent and,imperative that before any. General election takes place the reform of our present electoral ayetom should be enacted by the Government.Undoubtedly the beet,vend probably in the. long run, the only system that will maintain for the intellectual and middle classes a share in the government of.the country ia the system of proportional representation.:; tn-yarloua forms the principle has been adopted now in a very large number of oivi-iiaed communities arid In spite of the fact that in most of these

countries the electorate is neither as well educated nor as well trained in electoral machinery as the people of this oountry, no practical difficulties seem to have prevented the voting system of proportional representation being carried, out successfully.A short private Members1 Bill has been drafted and is about to be introduced supported by representative members of all parties In the House of Commons and a copy-of this    &apos; -Bill Is attached.   Although priraa facie complicated/ in -&apos; reality&apos;there is no essential difficulty In the application -of, a single transferable vote or tho creation of blocks of constituencies according to their situation in the country, schedules of which &quot;have already boon-carefully prepared -and which may with some modifications possibly bo adopted.   ;.The other ,two-methods that can come in review, to &quot;achieve- the object     reforming-our electoral system so as &quot;to. make certain that&apos;all-representatives are elected by a majority of those voting will be the.&quot;alternative vote&quot; or the .&quot;second ballot&quot;.,,.&apos;,:&quot;- .    . ,     , .j :, -Bis &quot;alternative vote&quot; method has the. advantage of avoiding two elections, but with this disadvantage that when -the elector gives his vote, he .1s uncertain of what, the real issue before him is, that is to say,,, he is not brought up . with--sufficient clearness to the issue as to whether he will return a candidate of one party or. of another.   On the other -haadft -this. .is.. thes;advantage of the &quot;second ballot&quot;,  ,Wlth the . sec end-ballot, the * candidate with the least number of . votes has been eliminated and there are only two candidates left In the field.!  It is,, therefore, obvious to the electors .what the result of their second ballot vote must be.   If we , conjecture ,an eleotion taking place with a conservative, aliberal and labour candidates, and: it. is. assumed, fcr ,argumentsJ .. sake;--ths;i-rthe&apos; liberal:-, candidate is at. the-,bottom--of, the, poll-,-;.-] with the conservative and labour left to take a second ballot,

it would bo then for the liberals whose candidate   had been at the bottom of the poll to decide whether they would prefer being represented by a conservative or a socialist.     Tho 3ame wotyld bo the case if the positions were reversed.    It, therefore, would not bo difficult for the two parties to como to an arrangement throughout tho oountry, because it would follow the more natural lines of political thought for tho conservatives and liberals to unite against socialism on the second ballot.It would be easier to do this than-to continue to attempt to unite the conservatives and liberals to support some one candidate who necessarily does not belong to one or other of those two political parties before the strength of labour in tho constituency ie known and the result of a labour victory made apparont in all its brutal nakedness.Very much tho same result could be achieved by proportional representation by the allocation of preference votes between conservatives and liberals., and the feelings and amour propre of both parties could be satisfied while they would thus bo giving each other more valuable support.     It is only some fusion of parties representing tho anti-sooialiet element in the country that would justify continued inactivity in facing this position.    I think enough time has gone by to show that the fusion of such parties on a large scale is not likely to take place within the near future.    That It might come about if the labour menace became so really apparent that partisans on all sides would be got to realise its dangor is not impossible, but 1 do not think that we pan afford to risk the grave danger of a labour government even in power only temporarily doing irretrievable harm before a solid party is created to oppose thorn.X would ask that a Cabinet Committee should be immediately appointed to go into this question and report to the Government without delay as to what stops thoy think should be taken to meet the situation,A.
