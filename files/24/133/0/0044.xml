224The Hd.Qrs. 18th.Inf.Bde. moved from Limerick to Londonderry on 11th February and the Galway Bde. Hd.Qrs. were abolished on 13th. Instant.Although the evacuation of troops from Ireland has been sus-pended, the movements within Ireland ere being continued as far as possible in accordance with the existing progi^-mme,  -.3 I am con-vinced that the limited number of troops in Ireland must be kept concentrated.There are now no troops West of the river Shannon, with the exception of 2 Squadrons of the Royal Dragoons, just West of Athlone and these will be withdrawn to the Curragh In the course of the next few days.In Murfster we still have troops at Limerick, Tlpperary and Fermoy, in addition to the troops at Cork and the battalions on the Coast at Tralee, Bantry &amp; Waterford.     I am particularly^ anxious   and am making every endeavour, to get the bat taller Way from Tralee but have been delated, bv t!Se Railway s&apos;2L*ike and the unsuitability of FENIT (Hear Tralee&apos;) as a port froiri which evaluation could be carried out by Sea.The situation on the frontier of Northern Ireland whitsh has arisen as a result of the outrages which have lat-sly occurred there has been referred to in my&quot;Note on the Situation dh the frsatler between Northern &amp; Southern Ireland&quot; forwarded to the C.IoS-.3* en Sunday 12th. Instant.On the occasion of the shooting of the Special co&amp;siafcl*9 at Clones on 12th. instant 1 L/Gpl. &amp; 2 05R. ofrthe VL&amp;*Ca?4o of the 18th. Inf.Bde. were travelling fjftnn Dundalt to Londonderry in the train in which.&apos; the constables were attacked.     They state that on arrival et ClOro&amp;s they saw a $arty of 20 Police board the train. At the same time about 20 men in civilian clothes opined fire o:n the whole party with Machine guns rif2^s &amp; revolvers.     These men they state were already in position on the platform and in the waiting room.     As the fire became more lii t-eftse the pblJ.ee and soldiers le $gthe train on the far sides     After about&quot; 10 minutes the soldiers&quot;returned to the train but satf nothing cf the Police. When on the train they were again fired at- so got out again and continued their Journey by, another, train,&apos;    There were ho cafiual-ties amongst the troops.The following further outrages have also been reported -On the evening of the .8th. February a man of the 17tteu Lancers at Galway was held up by 5 armed men aVsB his money and bandolier stolen.     On the 11th. a man of the same Regt. who was exercising was held up by 3 arnfed men and 2 officers chargers and saddlery were stolen. \Two motor cycles were  Stolen in an Ambush between Cork and Balllncollig-on the 10th. instant.As reports have been reoeived that there are likely to be attacks made on -the R.I.C. in W.l&amp;asister during the process of their concentration on Cork, I have given instructions that every assist-ance is to be given them by such troopB as are in the neighbourhood and have arranged that the R.I.C. are to be moved only in accord-anoe with a programme drawn up by the G.O.C. 6th. Division.(Signed)    CF.N. MACREADY.. GHQ,. Ireland. GENERAL,.3tifeFebruary, 1922. COMMANDING-IN-CHIEF, IRELAND.P.S.
