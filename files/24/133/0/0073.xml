S DOCUMENT IS **S PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY13 GOVERNMENT.CRET.3CABINET.,3771. ALEVIES MADE ARISING OUT OP CONTROL.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.During the war various Government Departments, in order to prevent traders from making undue profits by reason of war conditions and also in order to provide for the regulation of control of various commodities, adopted the praotice of ex-acting payments from traders in consideration of the grant to such traders as were prepared and desired to avail themselves of them, of special privileges and facilities which generally, but not invariably took the form of licences by the Departments. As a result of this procedure there was collected for the Exchequer by various Departments a sum amounting   in the aggre-gate to approximately at least  15,000,000, and probably much more.     Particulars of the principal cases in which these various payments were made will be found attached hereto.   The various Departments found it necessary to adopt the course they did also in order that the necessary schemes of control should not have the result that inflated profits, which were alone attributable to the various rationing schemes, should inure forthe benefit of traders without any exertion on their part.As a result of the recent decision in the Court of AppealIn the case of the Attorney General against the Wilts UnitedDairies Limited, which has attained much notoriety not confined to food matters, considerable doubt has. been cast upon thelegality of these levies and it may well be that if that de-clsion is upheld claims will be made against His Majesty&apos;sGovernment which would result in a charge to the Exchequer ofthe above-named sum of  15,000,000.     In fact demands have al-ready been made for repayment and sums, which would otherwise have been paid, have been withheld.     Proceedings also have-1-
been started against the Board of Trade in oases arising out of the exercise by the Shipping Controller of his power to license sales of British ship3 to foreign flags and other proceedings are threatened against the Food Department in respect of the levy made with regard to Milk.In these circumstances I ask for the approval of my colleagues to the introduction at the earliest possible moment of legislation to remove all doubts as to the legality of the various exactions and levies.     If this is agreed to, I anticipate no great difficulty as to the form of legislation, as it is thought that a short general Bill could be drafted to cover all cases.In connection with the shipping licences the Depart-ment took the opinion of the Law Officers who advised that legislation ought to be considered but that it should be postponed until after the decision of the House of Lords in the Wilts United Dairies case because, if the Government were successful in that case, the question might not arise -It must,&apos; however, be borne in mind that applications are now being made for refunds of amounts charged for shipping licences and in some instances proceedings have been in-stituted:   any delay in the introduction of legislation is therefore likely to increase the difficulty of securing legislation to cover all claims which may be made.(Intld.)

I.     MILK, DIFFERENTIAL PRICES 1919. 2d. per gallon surcharge upon South Western Milk,In order to ascertain the cost of the production of milk throughout Great Britain, the Food Controller in January 1919 appointed a Travelling Commission which included representa-tives of the Ministry of Food, the Board of Agriculture, the Consumers&apos; Council, and Producers&apos; Organisations.     This Commission recommended that different maximum prices should be fixed in certain parts of the country to equalise the cost of production which, in some parts, was greater than in others,The Food Controller adopted these recommendations and embodied them in the Milk (Summer Prices) Order, 1919.     This Order provided that producers&apos; and wholesalers&apos; maximum prices should In the South Western Area (Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset) where the cost of production was lower, be 2d. per gallon lower, and in the industrial area of the lest Riding of Yorkshire, where the cost of production was higher, be 2d. per gallon higher than the maximum price applicable to the rest of the United Kingdom.The maximum retail prices for the Area of each Food Control Committee were fixed by the) Food Controller according to the local cost of distribution but, in doing so, he took into account the differentiated producers&apos; prices.In May, 1919, the producers&apos; maximum price in the South Western Area was 1/2d. per gallon, in the industrial area l/6d. per gallon, and in the rest of England and Wales l/4d. per gallon^ while, for the wholesale dealers (other than the producers) the maximum prices were respectively l/6d., 1/lOd. and l/8d. per gallon.Though such consumers as resided in the South Western Area obtained under tnis system of differentiated prices the
the benefit of the lower oost of production, yet, as a very large volume of milk is exported from the South Western Area to other parts of England and Wales, both by producers and wholesalers, unless special arrangements were made to meet . the situation, dealers outside the Area would buy exported milk at rates 2d. per gallon less than the normal, and sell it at rates based on the normal cost of production, the result being that the consumers of such milk would not benefit by the cheap-er cost of production, but the dealers would secure an unjustifiable profit of 2d. per gallon over and above the normal profit properly applicable to their business, and, moreover, what is more important, the equitable distribution of milk would be endangered by the competition to purchase milk from the South Western Area.     It would have been Impossible to identify suoh milk on a resale to the consumer, having regard to the fact that the dealers draw their supplies from verynumerous sources.To meet this difficulty, the Pood Controller made Directions under the Milk (Distribution) Order, 1918, and the Milk (Registration of Dealers) Amendment Order, 1918, which came into force on the 1st of May, 1918, and which provided that, except under and in accordance with the terms of a licence granted to him by, or under the authority of, the Pood Controller, a person should not -1.   Buy or agree to buy, or take delivery of any milkproduced in the South Western Area for the purpose of any business outside of the Area, or 2.   Buy or agree to buy, or take delivery of any such Milk for the purpose of the manufacture within the Area of cheese, butter, cream, dried milk or condensed milk for sale by wholesale,
The form of licence adopted, was signed, on behalf of the Pood Controller and the Dealer, and it contained a Clause stating that in consideration of the     issue of the licence, the licences agreed to observe the conditions thereof and to pay to the Pood Controller the sum of 2d. per imperial gallon of milk purchased from the South Western Area at such time and in such manner as the Food Controller might direct.The object of this was (i) to prevent the dealers in question from receiving an Increased profit of 2d. per gallon which they had not earned (ii) to place dealers on an equal competitive basis whether they obtained   supplies from the South Western Area or not.The Directions further provided that except under and in accordance with a licence of a similar nature a person might not import .milk from outside the Industrial Districtfor the purposes of any business within such district.There was a 2d. per gallon Licence Pee charged in a similar way in respect of these licences.     The object was to allow the producer in the Industrial District whose costof production was 2d. per gallon in excess of normal to sell his milk in the District without being prejudiced by unfair competition.Arrangements were also made to deal with Milk Products manufactured in the South Western Area from Milk produced in that Area.Clause 2a (ii) of the Directions provides that except under and in accordance with the terms of a licence (granted on similar terms to those above referred to) a person&apos; should not buy or take delivery of South Western Milk to be manufactured into Milk Products within the South Western Area.
 .252,625.The object was to prevent the manufacturer of Milk Products in the South western Area under-selling or unfairly competing with the manufacturer of Milk Products outside the Area.The validity of the orders and Directions leading to this 2d. surcharge has been called into question and licencees have in fact refused to pay the 2d. per gallon licence fee.The total amount payable by Lioencees under the &apos; Scheme is  252,625. 9. 5d. of which  87,874.17,l0d. has been received by the Department.In view of the disputes which have arisen the above sum of  87,874.17.l0d. has been placed to a Suspense Account pending the decision of the Courts.Proceedings in the nature of a test Case were com-menced by the Crown by Information to recover from the Wilts United Dairies Limited a sum amounting to  15,027 in respect of licence fees.In these proceedings, namely, the Attorney Generalv. Wilts United Dairies Limited, the Crown obtained judgment in the Court of first instance.     The Company, however, appealed and the Court of Appeal reversed the decision previously obtained.The Crown have now lodged an Appeal to the House of Lords against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
(2)    FLOUR AMD BREAD (PREOLUDBD PURPOSES) LICENCES.See Clause 10 of the Flour and Bread (Prices) Order, 1917, with two amending Orders and Clause 9 of Flour and Bread (Prices) Order, 1920.Persons .desiring to obtain flour for purposes mother than the baking of bread, oakes or blsouits for retail sale, filled In a form of application on whioh was specified the charge of the licence per sack of flour, which charge was based on the differenoe between the subsidised price and the real prioe*     In every oase the payment was made before the licence was issuedeThe amount realised in all was approximately  7,102,663, which went in reduction of the Bread Subsidy.Only In one instance was a protest reoeived, where certain manufacturers of blsouita. were charged for wholesale sale, whereas they urged that their biscuits were wholly Intended for retail sale, so that they ought not to have to pay.      There would seen to be considerable foroe in this connection, but it does not of oourse affect the legality of the oharge generally.    The refusal to refund the money was based on the faot that in their case, as in all others, the price of biscuits to the public had been advanced and it was then thought to be the duty of the Government to prevent unavoidable profiteering wherever they could.The Food Controller issued in September 1917, the Flour &amp; Bread (Prices) Order 1917, which not only fixed a maximum wholesale prioe for flour, but also fixed maximum retail prices for flour and bread.     In order to limit,in some degree the uses to which subsidised flour might be put Clause 10 of the Order prohibited the taking of delivery of any flour for the purpose defined in sub-olause (d)&apos;thereof, except under the terras of a Licence granted by or under the authority of the Food Controller.
By an Order dated the 18th December, 1918, amending the Flour and Bread Prices Order, 1917, this Clause, fvs originally operative, was revoked and the more elaborate clause now appearing In the Order was submitted therefor.     The effect is the same.     The Order makes no reference to any payment as a condition precedent to the issue of tho licence but it was always intended to make a oharge approximately equivalent to the difference between the cost of the flour to the State and the reduced selling price, that is to say, equivalent to the rate of the subsidy.     The ohargo made for the Licence was generally at the rate of 36/- per 280 lbs. for all purposes except export and Ships&apos; Stores as defined in sub-seotions(iii) and (iv) of the clause, the charge for which was is/- per 280 lbs.Early in 1919, the Pood Controller wished to abolish the Licences, so far as matters of food (i.ee biscuits^&amp;c,) were oonc-emed.     The War Cabinet decided, however, that the then system of lloence or charge or payment must be nain-tained with an adjustment of the rate of payment to the rate of subsidy for tho time being. 7,10^,663.
(3) THE BREAD SUBSIDY REDUCTION SCHEMES. SPRINjj AND AUTUMN * 1920.The Cabinet decided in February, 1920, on a reduction of the Bread Subsidy, which, expressed in figures, involved an increase in the prioe of a 280 lb, sack of flour by 19s. 3d., the increase being passed on to the consumer.     The problem immediately presented Itself of how to prevent the trader hold-ing stooks on the date of the inorease from profiteering at the oohsume^s expense to the extent of the increase.     It was decided therefore, that an arbitrary period should be fixed between the date of the Inorease in the controlled wholesale prioe of flour and the date of the inorease in the retail prloo of flour and bread.     On the assumption that traders held on an average 5-4 weeks&apos; stooks of flour, this arbitrary period was fixed at four weeks.The advance of 19s. 3d. per sack took place accordingly on 15th March but the controlled retail price of flour and bread remained unohanged until 12th April, upon whioh date retail prioe oontrol.,was removed.Wholesalers were required to pay to the Ministry of Food 19s. 3d. per sack in stooks of flour in their possession at closo of business on March 13th.     Retailers holding stocks in excess of their sales during the four weeks were required to refund the Ministry of Food 19s. 3d. per sack on stocks of the oheaper flour in their possession on April 12.   (Traders on the other hand whose stooks on March 13th fell short of their sales during the succeeding four weeks were refunded 19s. 3d. per sack on stooks purchased during the four weeks at the higher prioe and Bold within those four weeks at the controlled lower price).For the working of this scheme   it was necessary to chock the stooks of traders on March 13th and on April 10th and to obtain from them a return of their sales during the intervening
four weeks *In order to be In a position to demand 19a. 3d. per sack on existing stocks of lower-prloed flour at the time when the price was raised, Flour Requisition Orders were issued.    By means of these instruments all flour in the hands of whole-wholesalers at tho dose of business on the 13th Maroh and of retailers on 10th April was requisitioned by the Pood Controller.The theory of the scheme waB that the Pood Controller purchased the requisition flour at the price which the trader had paid for It and resold it at the higher prtofy claiming from the trader the differonoe.With modifications and improvements of detail the Spring scheme was repeated in the Autumn when the wholesale, price of a sack of   flour was again lnoreaee by 22a. 6d.In the event over 95^ of the amounts claimed from whole-wholesalers and retailers were recovered, and the question ultimately arose whether the Ministry of Food should take legal proceed-inge with a view to recovering the balance.     In the light of the adverse public criticism of Mr. Justice Bailhache&apos;s Judgment in the 2d. milk case and the subsequent reversal of his decision by the Court of Appeal, it was considered undesir-able to involve the Ministry in further litigation of a similar nature, especially In view of the decision to carry the 3d. milk case to a higher court.     It was borne in mind, moreover, that a single adverse decision might place the Depart-ment in the position of considerable difficulty in regard to the  200,000 already oollectod.     In view, therefore, of the comparative smallness of the deficit outstanding it was thought best that this deficit should be written off as irrecoverable. 800,000.-11-
4.     ADDITIONAL BEER LIOKflOES.When it was decided to brew additional boor for munition and agrioulttiral workers, It occurred to the Brewing Department of the Ministry of Pood   that some portion of the enormous profits made by brewers under the restrictions could be usefully diverted to the Exchequer.     They thereupon charged an additional 30/- a barrel extra licence duty and procured a sum of if millions which, by direotion of the Treasury, was devoted to tho reduction of general administration charges.     Questions were asked in Parliament on two occasions, but this v/as a long time ago and there was keen competition for the licences. 1,750,000.
5* .   LEVIES   ON   IMPORTED   MEAT.Lories were mado under the Imported Meat (Requisition) Order of Octobers 1919.These were oh the basis of 2d. per lb. nominal, and were utilised for the purpose of discharging the costs of oertain Meat Importing Committees.These, it is believed, were paid by all Importers, with the exception of Messrs. Hart Harrison &amp; Company, regarding meat from South Africa.The process was approximately as follows:On the arrival of a meat ship the Importers asked the Meat Section whether they were to sell the Meat on Government Account, or whether they would be allowed to sell the meat on their own aooount.If the Government did not want the particular consignment it was released back to the Importers on their paying the above mentioned 2d. per lb.The amount received by this means is  292,000, with one unpaid amount of  1,800. 295,800.
6. CONTROL OF HIDES.Hides were originally controlled by tho Army OoUncil and when the Live Stock organisation of the Ministry of Pood was formed they had a uniform value of approximately 10d, a lb.   This was the basis adopted by the Ministry in settling their schedules of prices to farmers and butchers.     The hides were sold to an authorised hroker, who transferred them to an authorised tanner, in both cases at the controlled prices.   There was then no world price of hides, but on the cessation of hostilities the value of hides rose considerably, and the Department put up its price to the tanners.    The price to the butchers remained unchanged.    The difference was collected on behalf of the Central Live Stock Fund and applied in reduction of the selling price of meat.   The difference ultimately amounted to 8d. a lb, or, approxi-mately,  2 a hide, and reduced the expenses of the Central Live Stock fund by  1,500,000, 1,500,000,
7. POTATO SOHSttB 1918 (MINISTRY OF FOOD ) %For the purposes of Control the oountry was divided up into zones.By Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regula-tions made &quot;by the Controller in the year 1918, he acquired oomplete control of the distribution and disposal of the crop, but d d no(&apos;purport to purchase the crop outright.If a potato dealer wished to transfer to and distribute hie potatoes in a zone uthervthan- M% own he was permitted to do bo only if equipped with a lioence which provided that he should pay a levy or charge of l/*- per ton on the potatoes so moved.-15-
i6 I&apos;8. LICENCE CHARGE ON EXPORT OF WHEAT.The consignment or shipment of any Wheat from any part of the United Kingdom to any destination in the Channel Islands or to   the Isle of Man after the 1st October, 1917, except under and in accordance with the terms of the licence granted by or with tho authority of the Food Controller was prohibited under the Wheat (Channel islands and Isle of Man Export) Order, 1917, (S.R. &amp; 0. No.1006, 1917).Aa a condition to tho issue of licences a charge per quarter was imposed representing approximately the difference between the selling price of wheat established in the United Kingdom consequent upon the introduction of the 9d. loaf and the cost price of the wheat to the GovernmentHIn practice the issue of licences was confined to soed wheat.   Prior to September, 1919, licences were issued by the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies.   No special form of licenoe was used, the authority being by the letter whioh formed the receipt for the duty. The projected de-control of tho mills at the end of that year, however, and the anticipated fall in Home Grown Wheat prices rendered neoesaary a rationing scheme for export. The Export Licence Department of the Board of Trade were accordingly authorised to issue licences on the recommendation of the Boards of Agrioulture for England and/or Scotland up to a total 2,500 tons.For the year to 31st December, 1920, the ration was 2,250 tons,, of whioh 250 tons was reserved for Scotland.The sums oolleoted were as follows .     B. d,1st October,1917 - 31st August, 1918... 2,978. 19. 9 1st September,1918 - 31st August,1919.. 4,241. 3. 2 1st September,1919 - 31st March, 1920.. 5,617. 10, 4 1st April,1920 - &apos;31nt knrch, 1921...... 14,043.    6.10 26,881,   0.  1-16- -
The charge varied from 10-/- per quarter of 504 lbc. in 1917/1918 to 45/- per quarter in 1920/1921, aocording to the cost of importejwheat, 26,881.-17-
JDATTLE - FEEDING STUFFS -SCHEME., - MINISTRY OF FOOTXThere was a levy hy the Food Controller which varied In certain circumstances but which in most instances amount-B ed.ed to 6/3   per ton on the manufacturer, s 0)5/- was passed on by the Food Controller to thedistributing dealer as commission in accordance with ascheme agreed or understood to be agreed with the trade s ,d,and l/3   was paid to Finance and port Committees, in further pursuance of the scheme, to provide for theexpenses of the Committees,At the termination of control there was an unexpendeda 0d.balance of the amount of these   i/3 portions of the levy in the hands of the Finance Committee.The trade propounded a scheme for the use of such balance for the purposes of a charity and the charitable scheme is being considered by the Court,    (Edwards v. Pearson).It does not appear likely that any member of the trade will make a claim in respect of the l/Sd. portion of the levy and the Ministry of Food have disclaimed interest in the fund.The sum involved in the above mentioned proceedings is approximately  50,0008 50v&apos;X)0.18-
10. MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE.Seed Wheat.Tax of SO/- per quarter in 1919.&quot;    &quot; 45/-   &quot; &quot;       * 1920.to equalise hone and foreign prices.Hop Control.(a) Controller buys and sells home grown hope and adds 5/- por cwt, for cost of administration,(b) A charge to brewer of 5/- per quarter Is made for permission to import foreign hops.   This is also in part to oover oost of administration,   The charge waa made by imposing a stencilling fee per bale.The total sumereceived for such charges for importing and using foreign Hops up to the 3rd January last amounts to approximately  198,000.
tifff LEVY MADE BY THE SHIPPING CONTROLLER.During the war no British ship was allowed to be transferred to p foreign flag, without the consent of the Board of Trade under the British Ships (Transfer Restriction) Aots and the consent of the shipping Controller under the Defence of tho Realm Act Regulations. These consents were only given in exceptional cases when by reason of the vessel^ age, or other cireurostances, it was not necessary to retain her on the British register.Speaking generally, no ship was allowed to be trane-ferred which was less than fifteen yearB old, and then only if a guarantee was given to build or purchase equivalent tonnage and place it under tho British flag.in addition, the owner of tho ship who applied for transfer was required as a condition of the transfer to pay If per cent, of the purchase price to the   Exchequer.The reason for this was that owing to British ships being subject to requisition there was such an enormous difference between British values and Allied and Foreign values that permission to transfer gave the shipowner a very great monetary advantage, and It was thought that the Exchequer should have some part of this advantageAt one time a ship was worth twice as muoh under tho French flag as it was under tho British flag, and three times as much under a Neutral flag as it was under the British flag.in all, the Ministry of Shipping collected about a million poundB in this way, but the collection of this sum was it is thought ultra vires.   Shipowners arenow claiming the return of the amounts paid by them, and
although they have no case In equity, for they reaped the advantage of tho sale at a high value which they do not propose to surrender, they have a strong case at law, with the result that in the absence of legisla-tion there is a distinct possibility of the Exchequer having to return the amount oolleoted. 1,000,000
12. MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS.(l) Licences^texporV steely,The steel industry was controlled - and subsidized and prices wore fixed in this country.The export of stool was prohibited except under licence.It was a condition of the. granting of such   licence that the exporter should pay a licence fee of 50/- per ton,    the approximate difference between the controlled and foreign prices.In this manner considerable sums may have been colleotedo-22-
13. COTTON CONTROL BOARD,Llcenoeg to work exoese machinery.Under &quot;The Cotton (Restriction of Output) Order 1917&quot; (August 9, 1917) powers were given to the Cotton Control Board to limit the &quot;number or percentage of spindles or loomB that may be worked in any ootton mill or weaving shed&quot;.   The instructions of the Control Board pursuant to this Order, limited the amount of raaohinory that could be worked to 60 per cent, of the machinery at the mill, except under licence.   Licences were, however, granted to work exoess machinery on payment of levies, which were to be used for the relief of operatives temporarily discharged as a result of the restriction. The percentage of machinery allowed was varied from time to time and at a later date levies were made on the machinery actually in use.The whole of tho money raised in this way (3,387,495) was not required, and a balance of about  1,750,000 remained,   A Trust has been constituted to deal with the balanoe and tho Trust Deed approved by ah Order of the Court,14.    BOARD OF TRADE.When goods had been imported into this country contrary to existing regulations, a fee was charged in some cases as a condition of allowing the goods to be delivered to the importer.The Sum involved is approximately  10,000. 10,000.
