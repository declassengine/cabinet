(?hi3 document Is the. Property ofHis. Britannict        sly/ e Government) .SCRBT . Copy Ho;      iutThei Present, Co//,1 iiicr. of ^ri^ultvgfti Memorandum by the Minister of - Agricultureland fisheries.I desire to call the attention of the Cabinet to the present condition of agriculture, and to the necessity of taking immediate steps to provide eome measure of relief if disaster is to &quot;be avoided.     There has been a sudden sxump in prices unprec* edented in agricultural history, and ao a consequence the position of many of the farmers is deplorable.     Between December 1920 and December 1921, wheat dropped from 86/9 to 4f/3d.    The value of other agricultural products has fallen in like proportion, and no one oan count upon-a rise.    At the same time the costs of produc-tion, including wages, have not fallen nearly to the same extent.Although other industries are suffering from the present depression, agriculture shows certain special features.(l)   Agriculture cannot close down temporarily as ordinary business oan and thereby save current expenditure during bad times.     A farm allowed to go derelict is ruined for iaa-;.y years to come. (2)   In the case of previous agricultural depression the industry was saved by the landlords who helped their tenants through the bad times by large abatements of rent and by other means,     Kany of the old landlords have now disappeared, owing to high taxation and cost of repairs, and the farmers who have bought their farms, often with borrowed money, have no alternative sources of help. Even where landlords have not sold they are top impoverished to support the industry.
(3)     Ve undoubtedly promised to see the industry through, and actually passed the Agriculture Act only tc repeal the first part of it six months later.     Farmers feel that they have beeu badly let down, and there are undoubtedly cases where farms were bought by tenants in reliance on our promise.    These Wen have a real grievance.Farmers do not a3k now for a renewal of Government subsidies, but they poii-t quite rightly to the enormous burdens on the land which are more than it can bear. They also ask that a credit scheme should be devised to carry them over their present difficulties.     I know that the present time is not an opportune one for making demands on the Treasury, but 1 venture to put forward these proposals which T think are just in themselves and will do something to repair the unfortunate position of Agriculture.JATJ.S. The debate on the Address on the 10th Fabruary showed howacute at the present time is the long standing grievance of agri* culturists with regard to tho incident of rates,&apos;They claim, and with justice, that inasmuch as their business involves the occupation of an amount of rateable property disproportionate to tile farmers income, they are over rated-Further, the services which have caused the recent great Increase in rates - education, main toads and the like, are of less benefit to them than&quot;to&quot;the other classes of the community.The principle behind their contention was recognised by the Agricultural Rates&apos;Act&quot;of&quot; &quot;1896, which provided for the assess-ment of agricultural&apos;&apos; laiid &apos; at&quot; one-half of its rateable value, a contribution &quot;from the Exchequer making up the difference,AS this contribution was fixed at its 1895 value, about  1,325,000, the value of this concession has been greatly diminished
by the serious increase in poundage.     This is felt the more acutely, the greater the proportion of agricultural land to the total rateable property in the parish, because the sum required has still to be made up within the parish.     With the eentribu-tlon from the &quot;Exohequer remairing a fixed sum, excess in the rates since 1595 has to be raised by an increased poundage on agricultural land as on the other rateable property.     Xf, for example the pariah consiated wholly of agricultural land any increased ana, to be raised by rates since 1995 would all come from an increased poundage rate on the agricultural land. Although there are no parishes without some other form3 of rateable property, in 3ome cases agricultural land may constitute 4/5 of the total rateable value.The demand, of the Agriculturist as expressed in the recent Land Union Beport- is that &quot;the Exchequer grants should be increased by a sum equal ta the actual deficit created in each financial year by relieving agricultural land of one-half of Its burden of -rates&quot; .Financially the effect would be as follows. -It is estimated that in 1920,.  6,416,000 was raised in rates o.-. agricultural land of a rateable value of  34,737,000, rated at a poundage of 5/lCi instea&apos; of the average rate in rural parishes, estimated at 11/9, and after allowing for other reliefs than that afforded under the Act of 1896.It is impossible to estimate what.,irpuld be- the increase over and above the present Exchequer contribution, of  1,325,000 if a relief, of one-half the rates on agricultural land   were, provided from the Exchequer, because the poundagewould everywhere be reduced in, varying degrees, but it. is .....unlikely that the increase in the. Exchequer contribution . would be less than  5,000,000.
The following example shows how the Increase would ?rork;- Rural Parish with total rateable value  20,000 of which  3,000- is agricultural land.

I therefore recommend that the question be looked at from another angle l.e. the extension of differential rating In favour of agricultural land.The Royal Commission on Agriculture In its Second Report (February 1896, para. 45) were of opinion that In
order to place agricultural lands in their righfc position as compared with other rateable properties, they should be assessed at one-fourth only of their rateable value. They are in fact so assessed in respect of Uie General -District Rate and of the Special Expenses Rate for the expenditure of Rural.District Councils on   sewage, water supply etc.   But tho Agricultural Rates Act of 1896, fixed; the differentiation at onl&quot; one-half in respect of the more important expenses which are met bv the Poor Rate (including Mueatlon).I believe that an assessment of agricultural land atone-fourth would be eouitable to-day, but In the present financial position I am content to claim that agricultural land should be assessed on, one-third Instead of on ,one-half of the .rateable, value,, the difference, i,,e* one-sixth, being made up. bya new   Exchequer Grant *   The financial, results vjou id be roughlyas followstm , &apos; .. &apos; . .  r      . t .Total raised in rates on agricultural land in 1921 at half the average poundage of11/9 Viz., 6/10* - &quot;  6,416,000Total that vrotild be, rcised if rates were paid on one-third Instead of one-half, &quot; -l,e. at 5/11 - k 5,346.667Leaving a-deficlene-T to be. made up by *       &quot;ermw Bxbheauer C-rdht &quot;of &apos;*&apos; 1,069;, 233 ifke effect, of this on the typlc.nl rural perish.   ,    ^ described above with a current rate of 10/- would bet&quot;agrioulturR1 Land fifi,000 at 3/4 .  1,33.other rateable property  12^00,0 at 10/- J5,O00.Existing Exchequer contribution 500New Exchequer Grant ^. &apos;PZI should propose that the new Exchequer Grant be paid as under the Tithe Rentcharge (Rates) Act, 1899.   It may I hope
be assumed that tho&quot;total&quot;sum raised in&apos;rates in rural districts has reached its maximum, and that the sum to be found by the Exchequer would therefore tend to fall below the sum of  1,069,,333 referred to above.The new Grant would go wholly to relieve agriculturists and can be justified by the serious position of agriculture as r temporary measure, pending the revision of the. whole system of valuation and rating,I have little doubt that suoh a concession would be hailed with gratitude by all classes of the agricultural community pending such more logical relief as would be given by a permanently greater differentiation In favour of agricultural land made concurrently with the Minister of Health&apos;s new Valuation and&quot; Rating proposals being carried into effect,, or by the transfer of a greater proportion of tho burden of such services as education and main roads from the ratepayer to the taxpayer,i The Claim for my proposal is not that it is logical or free from political criticism but that It is practical&apos; as a temporary measure of much needed relief and that the cost of little more than a million.is not an unreasonable price to pay for bringing a measure of contentment to the agriculture 1 community*X must add that my figures, taken from ordinary aources and without consultation with the Rating experts of tho Ministry of Health will doubtless be open to adjustment^ but &apos;my brofcd Claim&apos; remains that the rates on agricultural land shall be relieved to the extent of a million, or thereabouts.
OH In this connect lea the agriculturists have a furthertRGES. grievance which should be removed.   By the Ecclesiastical Tithe Rentcharge (Rates) Act cf 1920 the owners of tithe rentcharpes attached to benefices were relieved of a certain portion of the rotes on tithe previously borne by them, -The poundage was limited lo tig 1918 level; and further if the income from the benefice did not exceed  300 the rates upon the tithe rentcharges were entirely remitted,&apos;and If the income lay between&quot; 300 and  500 the assessment of the tithe renicharge was-reduced by one h*&quot;lf, &apos; i.e. to one quarter of the original assessment, as one half of the rates on tithe rent charge s was remitted by the Tithe Rent charge *&apos; (Rates) Act of 1699,   Ko provision was made to meet these remissions out of the Exchequer with the conseojsnce that they laave to be borne as an increased:;-pounde-.ge-&quot;by-the -other &quot;:* rate-payers .-in the rural parishes affected, in -the main ;by the land,&quot; In one &quot;instance indeed- ;thf $ ta6*eurt&apos; &apos;feSetti&apos;4)S&amp; &quot;increased the rates upon &quot;farmers by .es much as 2/7d In the pound, and it&apos;is-quite certain -that /Increases $$  this order-were not,contemplated when &quot;the; Bill was ;,under .-&apos;dl^es&amp;&amp;ion   Bit in Parliament *    % -      i tj    : g i &amp;Hs&amp; xr. i c^f-While- ths: remission of .rat&amp;&amp; to the ; tithe . owners A^as undoubtedly called -for*:-:especlat;.ly,in::.view- -of- /the-, ot&amp;er.:,v 1 -.dealings-^rith tithe- at that time,, rural ratepayers feel that the duty of- paying -, for th^-benefit -eor^rre-ilronr-a:.--particular class-,.should^not have .&amp;e.en thrown:won-ythtm^incidence ^^*^iiy^il^lli%^^St^&apos;^^^^I^^^S^I^3?&apos;^!^^-^,ratfshas proved to b$;/,Vfry--unequal,,. iThere are, no.   .....favailable statistics as to how many benefices are affected by the Act of 1920 (i.e, having a net income not exceeding  300 or a net income exceeding  $00 but not exceeding  500), but a general impression obtains that the effect of the Act
?TES ON ?ITHE ? CHARGES.

In this connection the agriculturists have a further grievance which should be removed. By the Ecclesiastical Tithe Rentcharge (Rates) Act or 1920 the owners of tithe rentcharges attached to benefices were relieved of a certain portion of the rates on tithe previously borne by them. The Poundage was limited ? its 1918 level; and further if the income from the benefice did not exceed £300 the rates upon the tithe rentcharges were entirely remitted, and if the income lay between £300 and £500 the assessment of the tithe rentcharge was reduced by one half, i.e. to one quarter of the original assessment, as one half of the rates on tithe rentcharges was remitted by the Tithe Rentcharge(Rates) Act of 1899. No provision was made to meet these remissions out of the Exchequer with the consequence that they have to be borne as an increased poundage by the other rate-payers in the rural parishes affected, in the main by the land. In one instance indeed this measure alone has increased the rates upon farmers by as much as 2/7d in the pound, and it is quite certain that increases of this order were no contemplated when the Bill was under discussion in Parliament.

While the remission of rates to the tithe owners was undoubtedly called for, especially in view of the other dealings with tithe at that time, rural retepayers feel that the duty of paying for the benefit conferred on a particular class should not have been thrown upon them only.

The incidence of this additional burden upon rural rates has proved to be very unequal. There are no available statistics as to how many benefices are affected by the Act of 1920 (i.e. having a net income not exceeding £300 or a net income exceeding £300 but not exceeding £500), but a general impression obtains that the effect of the Act 
of 1920 during the current rate year will be to relieve incumbents of rates amounting to about  420,000 (out of  522,000), and this sum - will in the main have to be pa Id by the agricultural ratepayer,   I ask, therefore, that a relief of the rates in this respect should be accorded out of the Exchequer, again by the method of the Pet of 189,9. HQOilB xne second relief to agriculture for which I have tcask ia as regards income Tax,   A farmer may be assessed as any other trader under Schedule D but as a rule&apos;he does not keep accounts that will enable him to make a return of income under Schedule D, and he pays under Schedule B on an assessed income equal to twice the annual value of his farm.   Prior to 1915 the assessment was on one-third of such annual value, but it was raised In 1915 and based on the full amount of the&quot; annual value, and later, in 1918, on twice the annual value. The assessment at double the -annual value of the farm was&apos; purely a war measure imposed, at a time when the profits of farming were considerable and it can no longer be justified by the state of the industry, I have not hitherto made any suggestion for amendment because the Report- of the Royal Commission- on Income: fax recommended the abolition of Schedule B, e measure which has at        bottom my support, because the enforcement on the farmer of the keeping of proper accounts is a\ salutary educational process which will eventually increase his efficiency.   But 1 cannot regard the present time as -Opportune for enforcing &quot;this measure-        must &quot;take farmers as they are and for the moment accept the fact that many of them ere not keeping accounts and ere in consequence called upon to pay Income rfax upon profits they have not earned, &apos; I accordinply&apos; ask the% the   re-war conditions should.be . restorld&quot;and that under Schedule B Income faK shall bo &quot;assessed ho&quot; longer&apos;1 et1 double, but at--otie* third of * the, annual value1.   The prospects of the&apos; f firmer&apos; as regards! profits ere
certainly no better and in their opinion very much worse than in 1914,   I am still of opinion that it is desirable to get rid of Schedule B, and should at a later date offer no opposition to that reform? nor would I resist its Immediate abolition as regards all occupiers of lends (whether of one or more farms) of an annual value of  500 end upwards.   In the meantime, however, I consider that It is 30th just end a much needed concession to farmers to reduce the assessment to the pre-war rate, l,e. to one third of the rent.It is possible that if farmers were billing to adopt Scheaule D as the basis of their assessment the concession I am asking for would not amount to any considerable sum, but having regard to their reluctance to keep the necessary accounts, I am satisfied that the smaller farmers would attach,considerable value to the concession.During the year 1920-21 the yield to the Exchequer under Schedule B amounted to  7,550,000.    It is difficult to estimate to what extent the sum would be reduced by the change I propose, because it is impossible to estimate to whet extent under the new conditions farmers will change from Schedule B to Schedule D or vice versa,-   In the present state of agriculture many men who found it profitable to pay under Schedule B will now declare their incomes are below twice the annual value of their holdings and elect to pay on their a ctual profits which is not likely to be anything at all for 1921-22,   The proposed alteration, confining as it does Schedule B to occupiers of land of less than  500 annual value, will force into Schedule D many men who had found Schedule B most profitable and then there would be a gain to the Income Tax as a whole.   The benefits will accrue to the class of farmers paying less than  500 a year in rent but still abovi the exemption limit, inasmuch as such men would be assessed at one-third of the annual value of their farm t    which would bring them if married below the exemption limit.
There Is great, need for a scheme of short term credit for farmers who require additional working capital for their business, but who ere not in a position toprovide the collateral security demanded by the Banks before they will authorise overdrafts or make loans.The question has recently been considered by a special Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Douglas Newton which was appointed on the initiative of the -Council of agriculutre re for England, and, after considering&apos; their -Report,. I ask for tho approval uf the Cabinet to a scheme on the following lines, leaving the details to be settled by my Department in consultation with the Treasury(a) That the Government should gire a guarantee to the.Banks against losses in respect of overdraftsgranted to farmers on the recommondation of the County Agricultural Committees,(b) That the maximum sum to be borrowed In any one, case, should not exceed  500 and that, the terra of the loans 8hou24 not exceed nine months In tho first instance but should be renewable ap to a maximum ,   period of two years if recommended, by the Agricultural Committee.(c) That applications should be entertained up to a , maximum, amount of  2^000,000*    ,      , ,,.   ,(d) . That the rate of irterest on the overdrafts should be 2 per cent acc ve Bonk rate cut cf which a,   re sex-veVfund against l-atee should fee created.ftir* Doug&quot; as EewtoV s Committee also recommend that special p. b si stance should bo graven to those farmers &apos; who p\u* chased their tkrnz between the&apos; date&apos; of&apos; the&apos; FfZuQ&apos; Minister&apos;s 4^ton Hall speech;on October 21st, 1919 and the &quot;date on which the repeal cf the Part I of the Agriculture Act; 1920/ was announced vis. June 9th, 1921,   The Cvirmtttee
suggest that In the-:e oases the Government should offer to guarantee advances to the extent of one half of the portion of the purchase money which waa provided by the farmer himself.After careful consideration, however, I have come to the conclusion thet in view of the serious financial rlak I should not be justified in supporting   a scheme on those lines, and in addition   I doubt whether it could be wise to admit any special obligation to the particular class If farmers referred to, many of whom purchased their farms   * for reasons quite unconnected with the agricultural policy of the Government at the time,(Signed)   A, G, B0SCA*B8.1st March, 1922.
