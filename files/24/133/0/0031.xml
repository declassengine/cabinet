CP-,OA BIU BI, 3 .FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE,Memo rap dtim \iy__ tho Jlinist or of, Agrioulture arid Fie toerieg^The progress that has been made in dealing with the disease oan best be gauged by considering the separate areas into which the country has been divided,.In Scotland, out of 32 outbreaks, slaughter has been com-pleted in 25 cases; 7, of which 2 or 3 have occurred during the weekend,, have still to be dealt   with;,In Northumberland and Durham 86 outbreaks have occurred and. have all been dealt with in Cumberland and Westmorland out of 19 outbreaks 7 are still cat standing-,     In Yorks, the worst-area, out of 359 cases slaughter has baea completed in 266 oases, most of the remaining 93 are in one district near York and fresh strength is being thrown into this group^     In Lanes and Cheshire of 8 6 outbreaks 2C remain to be dealt   with but it is expected this area will be cleared by the middle of tho week-     Sixteen outbreaks in the Midlands and 25 in the South-east of England have all been dealt.&apos; with.     It must be anticipated that the small crop of consequential outbreaks will still appear during this v?eek even in the areas   arhere slaughter has been completed, as for example in the Norwich area where the market infection was as late as the 4th February,,.The reassuring feature of the situation is that both daily reports of cases and confirmations are failing continuously, there have beon no recent extensions into new districts, and with the exception of the York area slaughtering is rapidly overtaking the outbreaks,,     During this last weekend only 42 fresh reports were/ receivediTuS rOCUMEHT 13 TIE ;?HO?ERTY OP HIS britannic MAJESTY&quot;&apos;S GOVERNMENT),
received as compared with 104 reportn in the previous weekend, and it should &quot;be noted that a larger proportion of the reports prcve to be unfounded now than in the earlier stagos of the attack.An estimate of the ultimate cost of the campaign may be formed as follows in 362 cases of slaughter of which tho valuation forma have been received the compensation payable amounts to  233,800.     Taking the average figure derived from these cases the compensation payable fcr tho whole of the 655 casiis confirmed up to date would amount to about  420,000. There would still remain the outbreaks among the cases reported but not yet confirmed and the consoqucntial cases to be expected. It would net be safe to estimate the total cost,  inclusive of administration and staff, at less than  700,000,At the Meeting of the Cabinet on Monday, February 6th, (Cabinet 8 (22), Minute 2).  I asked permission to spend up tc  500;000(      It is probable that this sum will be exceeded.     In the view of my expert advisers we shall be able to stamp out the disease if we continue the present policy, and it would be disastrous to make a change now.     I have spoken to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the subject, who is willing that I should carry on up to say  700,000,  inclusive of administration and staff.(Signed)    A.G. 30SCAWEN.14th February,  1922.
