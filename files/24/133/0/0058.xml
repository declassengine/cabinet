3756.CONTROL OP CHARGING POWERS ON TRAMWAYS BY THE MINISTER OP TRANSPORT.Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport.On October 27th the Home Affairs Committee considered the, question of making permanent the present system whereby charges for tramway undertakings are fixed by the Minister of.Transport, on the advice of a committee, and decided to postpone the matter for further consideration.     For the convenience of the Committee I submit a draft Bill showing the oxact effect of the proposals.As I stated before, the course suggested Is to make permanent the existing temporary law, and I am pressed to adopt it by tramway undertakings both municipal and private.    I am Informed by a deputation from the Municipal Tramways1 Association that an enquiry on the subject was addressed to the 92 Municipal Tramway undertakings.   Of these 82 were in favour of the course suggested and 1 against.   No replies were received from 8, some of whom are moribund, and 1 took up a neutral attitude.     At a meeting representing 64 private undertakings a unanimous resolution was passed supporting the proposal.The Bill follows existing legislation with the addition of clauses:(1)   Including In tho scope of the Bill trackless trolley vehicle and omnibus undertakings whose charging powers are regulated by statutory provisions.     The exclusion of these undertakings from the benefit of the previous Acts has caused hardship.(II)   enabling the Minister td call for accounts, returns, and statistics.   Hitherto tramway returns have been obtained by order of the&apos; House of Commons and this clause would substitute for an order of the House of Commons each session a statutory power.   Atthe present time a representative committee Is considering the
tramway returns and statistics which are published annually with a view to rendering them more useful.     It is possible that as a result of their deliberations they may suggest a standard form of accounts for tramway companies on the analogy of the statutory reilway accounts required by the Railway Companios (Accounts and Returns) Act, 1911,     In that case It would be desirable to take the necessary powers in this Bill, which on other grounds the tramway undertakings are anxious to obtain.At the present time 70 Orders made under the Temporary Act and 3 Interim Orders are in force, while 3 others are awaiting report by the Advisory Committee 6mm&amp;&amp;mm*   If the present legislation Is allowed to lapse a large proportion of these undertakings will have to come to Parliament for additional powers since they cannot continue to run at the maximum charges for which they have Independent statutory authority.I do not anticipate any opposition to the Bill except on the ground that It continues a bureaucratic power, but the number of cases in which revision, either upward or downward, of existing charges will be required, in any year, is small and no special staff, which would not otherwise be required in the Ministry of Transport, need be retained for the purpose.From the point of view of the public the present law which it is proposed to continue affords a far readier and cheaper means of moving for the reduction of charges or opposing their increase than would be afforded by the right to appear before a committee of the House.   Moreover, if tramway undertakings were forced to go to Parliament for maximum powers, those which they will rightly obtain may become excessive if the value of money continues to increase.I ask leave therefore to Introduce the Bill In the formattached, with the addition if necessary of more detailed provisions for prescribing a form of accounts for tramwayundertakings, if I am so advised by the Departmental Committee.liniatry of Transport.
