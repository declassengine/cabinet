JrATHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BHIMSIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.GAB I BB g,.UMEl^PLOYME-HT INSURANCE BY I INDUSTRY - GEDDES REPORT. MEMORANDUM BY TEE MINISTER OE LABOUR.HiE. It was one of the recommendations of the Geddes Committeethat a &quot;Committee of experts&quot; should be set up to examine the4*      question of the relations of Health Insurance and UnemploymentInsurance and to explore the possibility of developing Unemploy-ment Insurance by Industry.     The Minister of Health and I in consultation with Sir Eric Geddes agreed that this recommendation really involved two Committees, one an Inter-departmental Committee to consider the machinery of Health Insurance and Unemployment Insurance - a matter which Sir a. Mond and I have discussed for some time past, - and the other, a more repre-sontative Committee, to consider the bigger question of industry undertaking its own Unemployment Insurance.     These proposals were approved by the Cabinet Sub-Committee.-he former Committee has been appointed and is at work. The other Committee necessarily must include representatives of employers and employed snd the present moment is hardly a propitious one at which to set it up.     With such an extra-ordinary amount of unemployment, industries are hardly likely readily to accept the general proposition that they should under-take the burden of unemployment.   It would, in my view, be unfortunate if the development ox the idea of Insurance by Industry   -   which notwithstanding its very great difficulties is one that we have consistently favoured and made provision for in the ^ct of 1920,    - should receive a setb&amp;ck owing to an oaversa report by a Committee which met in circumstances so
1unfavourable as those that exist at this moment.    On the other hand, I am most anxious that the leaders of industry on both sides should begin at once to give consideration to the problem and to think out the lines on whioh it might be solved through some agency costing less than the present scheme.     Accordingly I propose to circularise Employers and Trade Unions in the sense of the Draft letter attached, urging thorn to take the matter into consideration at once and to advise me what their views are and what practical suggestions they can make so that those views and suggestions can have sympathetic consideration immediately so far as I am concerned, and can then be submitted to the Committee which is to be set up.In this way we shall not only have started people thinking seriously about the problem but we shall have collected a volume px opinion and suggestion which will be of great use to the Committee when it moots.I propose to send the letter as soon as it can be prepared for circulation.(Sgd) T.j. MACNaMAEA.February 14th 1922. Ministry of Labour.
198CONFIDMTIAL.DRAFT LETTER TO EMPLOYERS&apos; ASSOCIATIONS AND TO TRAPS   UNIONS.Sir,You will no doubt be aware of the fact that for some time past the Ministry of Labour has had constantly under consideration the question of the extent to which Unemployment Insurance might be provided for and adminie-tered by industries themselves rather than as at present by the Central Government.     In the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1920 provision was made whereby schemes could be arranged and administered by Associations, representing the employers and employed In a given industry, who were prepared to adopt such schemes.     For various reasons, not the least of which was the great depression In trade, the industries did not avail themselves of the opportunity afforded by the Act.     It remained, however, the policy of the Government to do everything possible to encourage industries to administer their own schemes for dealing with those of their workpeople who become unemployed;   but owing to the great financial burden caused by the un-precedented unemployment which began towards the end of 1920,    the Government were compelled through the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1921 to close the door temporarily to trades whioh might otherwise have proposed special schemes.     It was only the urgent need of preserving funds to meet the general burden of unemployment that made thi3 step necessary and as soon as the state of the Central Fund permits I shall again welcome and encourage the establishment of special schemes for dealing with Unemployment Insurance on an industrial basis.
199In the meantime the Committee on National Bxpendi-ture (the Geddes Committee) have again called attention to the point and in accordance with their recommendations an enquiry, by a Committee on which employers and employed would be represented, into the possibility of placing Unemployment Insurance on the basis of insurance by industry is contemplated.      In these circumstances, I am most anxious to lose no time in securing the fullest possible consideration of the whole matter, although I realise that the difficulties of making any drastic change in the basis of Unwrvplov-ment Insurance are aggravated by the present volume of unemployment,      I therefore consider it desirable that those practically concerned with industry should themselves give consideration to the problem In each trade and should think out the lines on which it might be solved through some other agency, having careful regard to the cost involved in the new proposals as compared with that of the present State scheme.   By this means the Government will be in a position to know what are the considered views of employers and employed in each industry and will be able to consider any practical proposals which may be put forward.I should not v/ish to limit in any way the scope of the consideration to be given to this matter.    On the contrary, I should be glad to see the leaders of industry consider how far changes in the present arrange-monts for dealing with unemployment insuranoe can. bo suggested with a view both to ensuring economy and enlisting the co-operation of all concerned in estab-lishing such conditions as will&apos;enable State participation in the matter to be reduced to a minimum.
200It will be apparent to you that any scheme of Uneiaploy-ment Insurance must be accompanied by arrangements for dealing with the registration of those- who are out-of-work, for the. payment of benefit to those entitled to it, ana for the notification of vacancies in the industry whioh such parsons can be asked to fill, and I should be glad if, in considering the matter, your Association would keep these questions in mind.I should be glad therefore if you would bring these matters at once to the notice of your Executive and would favour me with their considered views upon the steps which in their opinion might be taken,    I should welcome any suggestions or comments which your Association may be able to make, and I will undertake that your proposals shall receive the most sympathetic consideration by this Ministry with a view to their submission to the Committee of Enquiry ?*hieh will later on be set up*I am,Yours faithfully,5 -
