COMMUNICATION TO BE ADDRESSED TO THE SULTAN BY TLTS HIGH COMMISSIONER.Your Highness1. I have the honour to bring to Your Highness3^notice that certain passages of tho explanatory note which I addressed to you on 3rd Deoember, 1921, were interpreted, to my groat disappointment, in a manner not in accordance with the intention and policy of Hie Majesty&apos;s Governments2, Judging by many comments which have been published on the subject of this note, it vo uld appear that many Egyptians wore under tho Impression that Great Britain was about to abandon her liberal and .favourable attitude towards Egyptian aspirations, and to make use of her specie1 position in Egypt in order to maintain a political and administrative regime inoompatiblo with the freedom she had offered..3. Such an interpretation of the intentions ofHis Majesty&quot;s Government was quite mistaken.     On the contrary, the explanatory note emphasised the dominating principle&apos;that the guarantees claimed by Great Britain are not designed to involve the continuance of an actual or&apos;virtual protectorate.     Great Britain, as it is stated therein,  sincerely desires to see &quot;an Egypt omjoying the. national prerogatives ami the international&apos;position of a sovereign state.&quot;4.        If Egyptians have regarded these guarantees as being out of keeping with the position ,of a free country they have, on the other hand,, lost sight of the fact that. .    ...&apos;...   Great/.
Groat Britain has boen obliged to cliam them out of considera-tion for her own security in face of a situation whioh demands great prudence on her part, particularly&apos;in the matter of the disposition of her troops.     Present world conditions&apos;,- however,, and. the state- of effervescence which has prevailed in Egypt since tho armistice, are not permanent factors,- and it is to be hoped that while,, en the one hand, tho former will eventually improve, on the other, hand,. the time will come when, in the language of that note, Egypt;&apos;s record will give; confidence in her own guarantees.5, Ac to any desire to interfere in the internal administration of Egypt, Hie Ma;Jesty.rs Government have : sufficiently stated,.mid repeat.,.-, that their most ardent desire is to plaoe in Egyptian, hands, the conduct of their &quot;own affairs. .   The. draft:, agreement - proposed -by - Groat Britain did not depart from this idea, ;and in making- provision for the presence, of two British officials in the Minis trios of Finance and Justice, it was not her intention to use these two officials for the purpose of intervening in Egyptian affairs but solely in order to preserve the contact requisite for protecting foreign intorosts. -6. Suoh is the cole bearing of the guarantees thatwore demanded .by Great .Britain.     Thoy were claimed without any desire-to: impede Egyptians enjoying the full rights of a national Government-. ...7.. ...     Animated as she is with these intentions, it will be understood that it is repugnant to:Groat Britain on the one hand to coo Egyptians;.delay by &apos;their own acts the realisation/
realisation of an ideal aimed at by both parties, and on tho other to be compelled, herself to Intervene to re-establish order whon it is threatened in snob a way as to arouse the fears of foreigners and to involve the interests of foroign Powers.     It would be much to be regretted if Egyptians should see in tho exceptional measures which have recently boon taken any prejudice to the ideal to which they aspire or an intention on the part of His Majesty&apos;s 3-overnms/ji, to alter the pulioy I have indicated.     In taking these measures, the solo desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been to put an end to a harmful agitation which by arousing popular passions might have such consequences as to jeopardise the whole result of tho efforts, of the Egyptian&apos;. nation *    Theso measures were taken primarily in the interest of the Egyptian cause, which has everything to gain by being studied in an atmosphere of calm and friendly discussion.8. How that tranquillity seems to be re-establishingitself thanks to the wise spirit which is the root of the Egyptian-&apos;dharaoter and asserts itself in times of crisis, I am ha-npy to be able to announce to Your Highness that P:*.*-* Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to recommend the a;ccompany&apos;-retraining Declaration for the approval of Parliament./    This will. I am confident, establish a regime of mutual confidence and lay the foundation for a satisfactory and final solution of the Egyptian problem.9. There is no obstacle to the re-establishment   .forthwith of an Egyptian Ministry for Foreign Affairs which will prepare the way for the creation of the diplomatic/-and&apos;/
and consular representation of Egypt.10.       The creation of a parliament with a right to control the policy and administration of a constitutionally responsible government is a matter for Your Highness and the Egyptian people to determine.        Should&apos; circumstances arise delay the coming into foroeof the&apos; Act&apos; of Indemnity With: application to all inhabitants of Egypt&apos; mentioned in the declaration accompanying ,thi&apos;s note, &apos;I desire to Inform Your Highness that I shall &quot;be prepared, pending the repeal&apos;of the proclamation &quot;of the 2nd -November,&apos; i.914,&apos;to suspend the&quot;applio tion of &quot;Martial law in&apos; respect of ail &quot;matters affecting- the free exercise&quot;of the political rights of Egyptians.11.&quot;       It is now&apos; for &quot;Egypt to respond, and. it is to be hoped she will justly afjpreclate &apos;the &quot;good intentions/of &quot;Sreat Britain, and that reflection and not passion will guide her
flBOMR&amp;TIOfl TO EG&quot;iiT*Whereas    &quot;     His Majesty&apos;s Govern-oent;,, in accordance with their declared intentions, 4eire forthwith to reoognise Egypt as an independent sovereign btate, andWhereas The relations between his Majesty&apos;s Government and egypt are of vital interest to the British Empire;The following principles are hereby declared1.        &quot; The British Protectorate over Egypt is terminated,and i5gy.pt is declared to be an independent sovereign Btate.8* Bo soon as the Government of His Highness shall passan o.ct of&quot; Indemnity with application to all Inhabitants of Egypt, martial law as proclaimed on the Sad of Bsvem;.;er 1914,  shall be withdrawn,3.
