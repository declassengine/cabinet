THE  DOCMNP. IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BglTAHNlC li^JESTY^S GOVERTOENT.63ECRET. CABINET..P.3752 COMMITTEE OH NATIONAL EXPENDITURE.............&quot;       :................&apos;......&quot; &quot; )WAR   OFFICE. &quot;\(Memorandum prepared with reference to Cabinet 9 (22) 2.)CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.Having discussed with Sir George Beharrell (representing; the Committee on National Expenditure) certain questions of fact on which the Committee and the War Office were not in agreement, we find as follows:-1. The calculation in paragraph 20 of the C-eddesCommittee Report on Army Estimates was based on figures wblch are unreliable In two points.   The provision for India is placed at 63,896 normal and 7,084 abnormal, whereas It does not appear to have yet been determined definitely whether the Indian garrison of white troops is or is not to be reduced.   The Constantinople figure should be 5,360 not 2,584.If the figures 5f the calculation be adjusted on the basis of substituting a correct figure for Constantin-oplo, and of claiming the whole Indian establishment a3 normal, the resultant excess is not 54,000 but just -under 40,000 men.The calculation of the Geddes Committee is logically Independent of the suggested method of reduction by dealing with oversea garrisons but in fact the latter method could not be applied in practice as an entire addition to the former.    No figure for the actual overlap can be given.
2, As regards the figure for maintenance ofBuilding.(paragraph 11 of Report) the year 1921/2 has heen inserted in the published edition,3, Any reduction of charge for clothing allowance(paragraph 13) in respect of longer wear of uniform is balanced automatically by reduction of credits for clothing sold tn soldiers.     Cash saving can arise only from reduced purchases from contractors to replace consumption; 4.Or only when the war stocks are exhausted?     As this will not be the case in 1922/3; the suggested saving of half a million In that year53 estimates is impossibler 4, The statement in paragraph 14 that horses &quot;hadbeen bought in the year 192.1/22 and kept to meet anticipated requirements which had not materialised, and had then been sold&quot; is incorrect.     The horses in question, purchased during the war, were sold in 1920 to save cost of keep, and have not        been replacedc     The report is in accordance with a statement which the Committee understood a witness to make,S. Paragraph 15, Motor Transports     The large numberof extra vehicles shewn in Appendix Fc are net (as stated in the first sentence of tho paragraph) &quot;the additional vehicles held as maintenance aid mobilisation reserves in 1922/23&quot; but are the vehicles actually in use for Ireland and other abnormal needs in November last,     The sketch estimate for 1922/23 provided only for normal needs,  end the reduction of these extra vehicles; now in progress, does not make a saving on that estimate,,The Geddes Committee recommend that &quot;the whole of the additional vehicles should be surrendered, which would at once release 4637 vehicles&quot; (line 13 of paragraph 15)?
The War Office point out. that the 463V vehicles include the Mobilisation Reserves, viz; technical vehicles such as gun tractorsj wireless telegraph vans and military ambulances-, essential on mobilisation and not obtainable by impressment like ordinary lorries, otri-(Signed) G,I.
