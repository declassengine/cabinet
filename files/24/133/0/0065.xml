London, S,Wol. on Monday, 20th February.. 1922 , at 12c0 Noon*
The Prime Minister pointed out that on the one hand it would he very awkward if the policy wero announced before Lord Allenby had communicated it to the Sultan of Egypt, but an the other hand, after he had comma ni cated it to the Sultan, it would be difficult tc change the policy; in fact, it would be Lord Allenb^s last offer,, Consequently, the fir_f.il offer would have boo;.! made before Parliament hag, been consulted,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL recalled the criticisms that had been made in the House of Commons as to the fulfil-&apos; mant of Government pledges on other questions and. laid stress on the importance of arranging a procedure that could not be criticised in this respect.LORD CURZ01T;asked by the Prime Minister to give his&apos;ideas of the procedure, said it was that some sort Gf general sketch cf the policy should be given in Parliament the same day.    Than Lord Allenby would return to Egypt taking with him his draft letter to the Sultan, with the Government&apos; s Declaration as an Annex, and would present it to the Sultan of Egypt,   He hoped and antic!-pated that Lord Allenby would be in a position to say that he had not only presented the letter j but that Sarwat:Paoha had succeeded in forming,a Ministry, Simultaneously, the document would be presented -to Parliament.      There would then be a debute in both Houses.   The only doubt he fait was as to the situation if Lord Allenby should not succeed-in-forming a -Ministry, Then a more difficult situation would arise, for it would be absurd to ask Parliament to. agree to a. policy when no Egyptian: Ministry would carry it out-.   He had. considerable hope ... however,&apos;: that this situation would not arise.     He felt that it was very important to be in
a position to announce to Parliament that an Egyptian Ministry was &quot;being formed at the same time as the policy was being ocmrmiriicated.     He presumed that in Parliament, the approval of the policy would be moved by resolution. He thought by thin means every pledge would &quot;be fulfilled.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that in the draft of the letter forwarded in his telegram Ho. 17 of January 121; CP. 3614, No,4. - Lord Allenby had included the following phrase :-&quot;With this object in view I am happy to be able to announce to Your Highness that His Majesty&apos;o Government are prepared to- reopngnenfl. to .British Parliament, without waiting foV&quot;c*bnelulsTo n&quot;of a Treaty, abolition of Protectorate and. recognition of Egypt as an independent Sovereign .   State.&apos;5That sentence had dropped out of tho new draft letter .   If it were re-inserted it would merely inform the Sultan that the   British Government were prepared to recommend this policy to Parliament.     In this way the Governments pledg would be fulfilled.LORD ALLENBY agreed that there was no objection tothis,THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the cane Committee as had drafted the new letter and the Government Declaration, namely, Sir Edward Grigg, Mr, Murray and Goseral Clayton - should meet in order to re-insert this phrase 0The Ministers then discussed the question of when the announcement should be made In the House of Commons,LORD allenby said he expected to be able to hand the Declaration to the Sultan next Monday afternoon and it was arranged that the announcement in both Houses of Parliament should bo made on Tuesday afternoon &quot; February 28th.
Tim LORD PRITY S3AI undertook, to arrange that if necessary, a day should be given for the discussion in the House of Commons on Y/wednesday, March 1st..LORD CUR30N raised the question of what would happen if Sarraat Pasha, should decline to form a Ministry .LORD ALLSHBY thought that probably Sarwat Pasha wonia not decline, but in that event he hoped he would be able to find someone also to form a Ministry.THB! PR&quot;iMB MIHISTSR remarked that if no Ministry was formed. Lord Allerhby -would govern aocording to the statusUJOjLTho conclusions of the Conference may bo summarised as follows:-(a) In order to oarry out tho policy approved by the Cabinet (Cabinet 10 (22)conclusion 2) consistently with pledges given to Parliament the following Committee;-Sir Sdv/ard Grigg,Mr* Murray of the &apos;Foroign Office.Genorai Clayton.should meet tho same flay In order to Insert in tho letter to bo sent by Lord Allenby to tho Sultan, words similar to those used in Lord All en by&apos;s original draft lettor of. -January 12-th, to show that the policy set forth in tho Declaration to Parliament (Cabinet 10 (22), Appendix ). was one which Hia Majesty&apos;s Government was prepared to .recommand to Parliament.(b) That the Declaration should bo communicated to the Sultax by the High Commissioner immediately on his returnto egypt, that is to sajt on Monday, February 27th.(o) Tho polioy should, be annonnood in both houses of Parliament on Tuesday February 28th.(d) The Lord Privy Seal should arrange for a day to be given to tho discussion on ffigypt if uesired by the House of Commons, on Wocnoeday, March 1st.(e) If the High - Commissioner is unable to form an Egyptian Ministry on the basis of this policy, he should continue to govern tho country asat present.

LORD ATJ353BY than raise a some minor points on]i IN which ho wished to have gnidanoo.LORD ALLBNBY said that on his official appearances in public, he was accorded a guard of Honour, ana the band usually playod the first five bars of &quot;God save the King,&quot; He pro summon d that it would bo advisable to continue this, LORD CUR EON agreed that ho should do so.jOIAIi 3.        LORD ALLMBY said that tho practice was for the18 ONSHIM.     Sultan to call on him on the Kingrs birthday, while he called on the Sultan on the Accession Day and on the Sultan1 s birthday;    thus he called twloo and tho Sultan called once,LORD CURZ0J3 said that anything that maintained the High. Commissioner1 s prestige should bo continued, and that there should he no change in this procedure.110 HOLIDAY 4. LORD ALLS?BY said that at present Eingrs birthdayrSS KING-S9BDAY.,       was a ptfblio holiday in Egypt.    This rather brought the Protectorate? into prominence ard was repugnant to many Igyptians.LORD OUR 2 ON agreed with Lord All on by that it might bo desirable to drop this public holiday as there were &apos; ample other public holidays, but he thought Lord Allenby should not do so on hie own initiative but only if asked to do so.LORD ALLI1BY said ho only wanted general guidance on this point and might have to refer for instructions later0SITS TO        5. LORD ALLS BY said that if he went to the races,* RAGES.the procedure was for him to go first and be received, by theGuard and five bars of the National Anthem&apos;. The Sultan-   5   -
arrived later and was received with the Khedirial Anthem. Ihe: Sultan loft first to tho strains of the Khedivial Anthem , and Lord -Allenby loft afterwards when five bars of the National Anthem were played.    He presumed that this . pro oo duro ohoul d c ont inue .LORD CURS ON agreed that it should,BE TIC 6.     LORD ALLMfBY said it was his custom as HighCommissioner to send for tho French or Italian Ministers and not to visit them.   He presumed that this should continue in order to show that the British High Commissioner was the senior foroign representative.LORD CURZ-ON agreed that this should bo the case.;,2.
