The gradual improvement in the woollen industry has been maintained. Cotton is still very depressed. There is no improvement in the lace-making industry. General engineering is still very depressed, but the slight improvement recorded in the motor and cycle section has been maintained. There has been a check to the activity in the tinplate industry. Building remains stagnant. Slight local improvements are recorded in linoleum manufacture, chemical manufacture and tanning.NOTE.

oI.-SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT.[From Autumn 1920 to Autumn 1921.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee,The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.[This Committee has since been in constant session and has up to the 3rd February, 1922, held 42 meetings.The problem of unemployment in one form or another has also been before the Cabinet on 56 occasions between the 13th August, 1920, and the 3rd February, 1922.](A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Bill of general scope was introduced on the 23rd December, 1919, reintroduced on the 16th February, 1920, received a Third Reading in the Commons on the 19th July, 1920, passed into law on the 9th August, 1920, and came into operation on the 8th November, 1920.This Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously&quot;. The weekly rates of benefit, paid out of contributions from employers, employed and the State, wrere 15s. for men and 12s. for women, after a &quot; waiting period &quot; of three days. In general, the amount of benefit was limited to one week for every six contributions paid, but during the first year eight weeks&apos; benefit could be drawn after four contributions had been paid.An Amending Act of the 23rd December, 1920. granted eight weeks&apos; benefit, up to the 31st March. 1921. to persons who had paid no contributions but had been employed for a certain minimum period in an insured trade in 1920.A further Amending Act of the 3rd March, 1921, increased the rate of benefit to 205. for men and 16s. for women. It further provided that during each of the periods March-October 1921 and November 1921-July 1922 16 weeks&apos; benefit could be drawn by persons who had been employed in an insured trade in 20 weeks since the end of 1919 and were normally employed in an insured trade genuinely seeking whole-time employment and unable to obtain it.A third Amending Act of the 1st July, 1921, reduced the rate of benefit to 15*: for men and 12s. for women and increased the &quot; waiting period&quot; to six days. This change was necessitated by exhaustion of funds owing to the great amount of unemployment and was coupled with a heavy increase in contributions and authority to borrow money from the Treasury to the extent of  20,000,000, as compared with  10,000,000 previously. At the same time power was taken to allow 22 weeks&apos; benefit (instead of 16) in each of the periods March-October 1921 and November 1921-July 1922.Between the 8th November. 1920, and the 27th January, 1922, the amount paid in unemployment benefit was  63,198,000.* Of this amount the contribution of employers since the 8th November, 1920, was  13,019,000,* that of. employed persons  11,886.000* and that of the State  6,374,000,* in addition to  1,606,000* in respect of benefit for ex-regular sailors, soldiers and airmen. The balance was provided mainly out of the accumulated reserve fund of over 20 millions and advances by the Treasury amounting to  9,540,000.*The number of persons in receipt of benefit was on the 1st July, 1921, 2,062,012 wholly unemployed and 988,364 on part-time, and on the 31st January, 1922, l,800,000f wholly unemployed and 287,0091 on part-time.(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A sum of  10,400,000 was provided for expenditure on arterial roads, half to he given by way of actual grant and half by way of a loan to Local Authorities. This money is administered by the Ministry of Transport and is expended by Local Authorities under their supervision. The men to be employed are selected by the Local Employment Committee of the Employment Exchange and preference is given to ex-Service men.A further sum of  3,000,000 was allocated to the Unemployment Grants Committee, presided over by Lord St. Davids, for the purpose of assisting Local Authorities to carry out at once works on which a substantial number of unemployed* The amounts for Northern Ireland are excluded as from the 31st December, 1.921.t Estimated.[7839] B 2
could be engaged. The conditions imposed with regard to the expenditure of this money were that works could only be approved in areas where there existed serious unemployment which was, not otherwise provided for, that the men employed should be taken from the registers of the Employment Exchanges, preference being given to ex-Service men, and that any grant paid should not exceed 60 per cent, (originally 30 per cent.) of the wages bill of additional men taken on for the work. Further&quot;, the works had to be such as were approved by the appropriate Department of the Government as suitable works of public utility. The condition as to recruitment of labour through the Employment Exchanges was subsequently modified so as to permit Local Authorities to draw all or a portion of the labour from Boards of Guardians. A condition has also been imposed by which Local Authorities carrying out schemes by means of direct labour may not, during a probationary period of six months, pay to unskilled men wages higher than 75 per cent, (or, in the case of men employed only half-time, 87  per cent.) of the authorities&apos; rate for unskilled workmen.In addition to the items outlined above, assistance from the Ministry of Transport has enabled Local Authorities to maintain in employment on road maintenance a number of men beyond those ordinarily employed on this work. Additional employment has also been provided by expediting work on sites and sewers for housing schemes. An emergency programme undertaken by the Office of Works, and the introduction of alternative work and a system of short-time working in Government Industrial Establishments have further assisted towards relief of the situation.In addition, Local Authorities have been encouraged by the Government to put work in hand without receiving definite Government assistance.From the autumn of 1920 to autumn, 1921, in this way, a sum of at least 25 millions was set aside by the Government and the Local Authorities for schemes of work which are still continuing. At least 200,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 125,000 men are employed (see table below).II. LATER MEASURES. [Autumn, 1921, onwards.]Before rising for the recess, the Cabinet agreed that the position with regard to unemployment was so serious that the Cabinet Unemployment Committee must devote special attention to it, with special reference to the exhaustion of benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.On the 19th August, 1921, the Cabinet, on the recommendation of the Committee, agreed that assistance could be given to Local Poor Law Authorities, either by way of expediting the sanction for loans or permitting the loans to be spread over a number of years, in cases in which the Local Authority could prove that there were exceptional circumstances due to the abnormal unemployment and that they were exercising their powers with due care and discretion.The whole matter was again discussed at the Cabinet which met at Inverness on the 7th September, 1921.On the 16th September, 1921, the Cabinet Committee further agreed that &quot; (1.) Where, for the purpose of providing employment in the present emergency, Local Authorities (including statutory bodies who do not trade for profit) put in hand or accelerate approved works (other than revenue-producing works), which would not otherwise have been proceeded with, or so accelerated at the present time, the State will give financial assistance on the following basis.&quot;Grants equal to 50 per cent, (since increased to 65 per cent.) of the interest and sinking fund charges on loans raised by Local Authorities to meet expenditure on schemes actively commenced before the 1st January, 1922, will be paid by the State for a period of one-half the term of the loans subject to a maximum of fifteen years. The expenditure to be taken into account will be all approved expenditure incurred within the period ending the 31st March, 1923.&quot; In approving schemes, special regard will be had to the direct employment of unemployed persons and to a preference being given to ex-Service men.&quot; (2.) In the case of revenue-producing works, grants will be paid, in approved cases, equivalent to 50 per cent, of the.interest on loans, raised for a period of not less than ten years, in respect of expenditure on schemes actively commenced before the 1st January, 1922, provided that such expenditure is incurred within the period ending the 31st March, 1923. These interest grants will be paid for a period of five years.
a&quot; (3.) Schemes shall not be authorised exceeding a total capital expenditure of 10 millions without consultation between the Minister of Health and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (since increased to 18 millions).&quot; (4.) Schemes must be approved by the Ministry of Health or other appro-priate Government Department as schemes which will provide employment and must be certified by the Ministry of Labour for districts where unemployment is severe.&quot;Subsequently it was decided that Local Authorities carrying out schemes by means of direct labour may not, during a probationary period of six months, pay to unskilled men wages higher than 75 per cent, (or, in the case of men employed only half-time, 87^ per cent.) of the authorities&apos;rates for unskilled workmen.III.-FURTHER REMEDIAL MEASURES.During the Autumn Session, 1921, the following measures were submitted to Parliament and approved : (1.) Amendments to Exports Credits Scheme. (a.) Government guarantee to be increased from 85 per cent of the cost to 100 per cent, with recourse against the exporter for      per cent.(b.) Maximum guarantee for each firm to be fixed by special Advisory Committee.(c.) Extension of scheme to all countries, including the British Empire. (d.) Extension of period of credit in certain cases to 1927.(2.) Government Guarantee of Payment of Interest and Principal of Loans raised by Dominions, Colonies, foreign Governments, public authorities, &amp;c, where such loans are to be applied towards the carrying .out of any capital undertaking or in the purchase of articles to be manufactured in the United Kingdom required for the purposes of any such undertaking, the British Governments liability under this scheme not to exceed  25,000,000. It is to be a condition of the guarantee that the application of the loan is calculated to promote employment in the United Kingdom.(3.) A Sum of 5^ Millions for General Unemployment Relief. Subject to Treasury approval, the money will be used in connection with schemes for providing employment on land improvement and drainage ( 650,000), forestry ( 250,000), light railways, and also by way of loans to Boards of Guardians or Parish Councils in necessitous areas who are unable to meet claims for relief (see Cabinet decision of the 19th August above).(4.) &quot; The Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; Fund,&quot; to be established by legislation for a period of six months for the purpose of making grants towards the maintenance of the-wives and dependent children of unemployed workers in receipt of unemployment benefit. The grants will be at the weekly rate of 5s. for the wife and Is. for each child. The necessary money will be obtained by means of further contributions paid by those now contributing to the Unemployment Fund (both employers and workmen) together with a grant from the State. The total amount available will be approximately 6^ millions.(5.) Overseas Settlement. A further  330,000 was voted to assist ex-Service men desiring to emigrate to the Dominions.(6.) Acceleration of Government Contracts. The position with regard to Government contracts is being examined to see whether, in any cases, a reasonable anticipation of requirements can be made with advantage from the point of view of increasing employment.(7.) Ministry of Transport. A further sum ( 2,000,000) will be available from the Road Fund for expenditure on roads to relieve unemployment in necessitous areas.(8.) Unemployment Grants Committee. A further sum of  600,000 was placed at the disposal of this Committee for dealing with Schemes on the original basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill.(9.) Office of Works. A sum of  50.000 has been voted for unemployment relief works in the Royal Parks.For the above schemes (apart from the assistance to Local Authorities with regard to Loan Charges, the Export Credits Scheme and the Governments liability under the Guarantee of Loans for Capital Undertakings) the Government has undertaken to find  12,000,000, the greater portion within the current financial year.T78391 B 3 &quot;
