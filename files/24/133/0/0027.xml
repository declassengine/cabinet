S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.JRET. .5726(A)CABINET.MINING INDUSTRY ACT PART II.Letter to the Prime Minister from the Secretary of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, dated 11th February, 1922.Dear Mr. Prime Minister,55, Russell Square, London, W.C.  1.11th February, 1922.I am directed by the Executive Committee of the above Federation to bring to your notice the following facts.We have been Informed by the Secretary for Mines that, In accordance with Section 17 of the Mining Industry Act, 1920, he proposed to lay before Parliament a report stating that Part 2 of the said Act has boon rendered abortive &quot;&apos;by reason of the failure on the part of those entitled to appoint representatives as members of the Pit District Committees Area Board, and the National Eoard, to avail themselves of such right&quot;.   Under the terms of Section 17, the report shall be laid beforo Parliament, and at the expiration of 30 days during&apos;the session of Parliament, from the date when it is so laid, all the provisions of part 2 of the Act, shall cease to have effect unless in the meantimo a resolution to&apos;the contrary is passed by both Houses of Parliament.    I have no doubt, that in the report submitted to you by the Secretary for Mines, a faithful record of the events   in the mining industry, relating to Part 2 of the Act, will bo set forth.On behalf of my Committee i need only to refer but briefly to the attitude of the Miners&apos; Federation towards the Mining Industry Act, from the time it was in the nature of a Bill? until the present day.    The Miners&apos; Federation opposed the Bill, and intimated in advance their unwilling-ness to work Part 2 of the Act, bec^so it destroyed the very principles of a national board for the regulation of wages in the mining industry, based upon the capacity of the industry as a whole, to pay wages.    Sub-section 3 of Section 10 of part 2 of the Act provided for the creation of area boards, which provided for the remuneration of the workers within tho area being dependent exclusively upon the capacity to pay wages of the particular area over which the area board, had jurisdiction.    It was because of this principle, and this alone, that the Minors&apos; Federation so definitely refused to take part in the administration of Part 2.    They had been accustomed under oontrol to the principle of the national regulation of wages;    a prinoiple originally introduced by the Government, and were preparing for a continuance of tho prinoiple in a subsequent agreement, which would take tho place of the agreement which existed under control, when control came to an end.   After the 13 weeks stoppage of last year, the miners were compelled to enter Into an
-    169agreement whioh made no provision for the national regulation of wages, upon the oapaoity of the industry to pay as a whole, but, in fact, entered into an agreement whioh provided that wages should be regulated according to the oapaoity of areas to pay wages;    the number of whioh is 13.    Tho tremendous disparities that now exist in the wage system, in consequence of tho distriot principle of regulating wages being adopted, must be familiar to you.    Immediately the agreement was entered into, the Winers1 intimated to tho Secretary for Mines their willingness to work Part 2 of the Act, now that circumstances had compelled them to abandon their original position, particularly since tho arrangement for the sottlement of wages by districts, was in close conformity to tho area boards contemplated in the Act itself.   We genuinely desire to work Part 2 of the Act, and to make it a success0   We are informed, however, that the Coalownors&apos; have intimated their unwllTJ.ngness to work Part 2 of the Act, and it is largely on this ground, that the Secretary for Mines has to report that Part 2 has been rendered abortive.     In point of fact the whole structure of Part 2 of the Act, broadly re-presents the actual proposals of the Owners&apos; at the Coal Industry Commission;    which proposals, as thoy themselves stated, provided that &quot;full and regular opportunity should be given to eaoh party to bring forward for discussion any question of mutual interest.&quot;    It appears to us, therefore, that the Coalowners are going back upon their own proposals.    In point of fact, the position of the industry is so bad, that it is only by the means of such proposals that the right spirit can be developed in the industry, necessary for getting it through the most difficult period in its history.    Nothing in the National Agreement, nor in the existing district agreements makes provision for the kind of co-operation contemplated in the Act, and it is because of this, and the facts related above, that we hope you on behalf of the Government, will be responsible for proposing a resolution in the House of Commons, which, if passed, will give effect to Part 2, and by that means ensure a long period of peace in the coal industry, which in the absence of the Act would in the Judgment of my Executive Committee be impossible.An early reply giving us tho benefit of your views horeon will oblige.Yours faithfully,(Signed) Prank Hodges.Rt. Hon./Lloyd George, K.P 10, Downing Street, Whitehall, S, ft.    1.
