This Document la the Property of His Sritannlo Majesty1a government cabinet.1 &quot;SUN EMPLOYMENT   AMD   UNEMPLOYMENT   INSURANCE. Vr2l Memorandum by the minister of Health. N.H.1.9.I make the following obaervations on the Memorandum of the Minister of Labour, CP. 3689, as to unemployment and unemployment insurance.Under the Unemployment Insurance Acts and the Unemployed Workers Dependants (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, provision is made for payment of unemployment benefit in respect of dependants as well aa in respect of contributors, whereas under the National Health Insurance Act no provision ia made for dependants.     This differentiation has caused considerable difficulty on the Health Insurance aide.     So long as it can be aaid that the unemployment provision for dependants ie only temporary, the difficulty can be surmounted, but if the Unemployed Workers Dependants (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1921, becomes permanent, a claim for corresponding provision^ with inorease of contributions, must be made on the Insurance aide. The increased contribution required cannot be put at less than 2d. - 3d. a week    (with proportionate State contribution) and there are serious difficulties in making such,an arrangement on the Health Insurance side, especially as regards the disablement benefit over a long period of years where the rate of benefit would vary according to marriage, widowhood, number of children at varying ages, etcA further point is that I have just introduced into Parliament a Bill which will have the effect of increasing the contributions under the Health Insurance Acts by  d. a week for employers and -g-d. a week for employees, aa from 2nd July next, the State contribution remaining unchanged.     This step is being taken to give effect tc a recommendation which the
Geddes committee made on the assumption that the Unemployed Workers Dependants Act would cease, to operate before that date. While the Act operates the position will be that we shall have a combined Health and Unemployment contribution by employer and employed of no less than 2s. 6d. a week.     My colleagues should have that figure clearly in their minds before deciding on the memorandum of the Ministry  of Labour.A. JuOUD.10th February,  1922.Ministry of Health.
