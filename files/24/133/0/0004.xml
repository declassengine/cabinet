CP.37 04CONFERENCE.GENOANOTE DATED FEBRUARY 6th PRESENTED BY THE FRENCH CHARGE D*AFFAIRES ON FEBRUARY 6th 1922.Genoa Conference.The invitations to the Genoa aonference were issued by the allied Powers.     The Italian President of the Council was charged by the President of the Cannes conference * the French President of the Counoil,-with the duty of issuing the text of the invitations. The invitations &quot;vere issued in the name of the Powers represented at Cannes,    France was one of these Powers. The French government have then neither to accept nor to refuse an invitation to the issue of which they were a party.     The French government oould however refuse to take part in the conference, were the invitation to be accepted by certain governments under conditions which would compromise the French government&apos;9 rights or threaten their interests.During the Cannes conference, the allied governments, on the proposal of Mr. Lloyd George, recognised that Tohitoherine*s telegram of January 8th constituted an acceptance by the Soviets of the conditions laid downin the resolution of January 6th.    This opinion, however, has not been publicly admitted, and, on their part,  the Soviets,  in the official answer, which they have just sent to the Italian government, make no allusion to the ccndi^tions of January 6th.If,  then,  the government of the soviets/
Soviets or any other government were to suggest by their answer cr by their official declarations, that they did not aocept,completely and beforehand the conditions .of January 6th, the French government would not be prepared to send any delegation tp the Genoa conference. The draft agenda for the Genoa Conference, adopted by the Supreme Council at Cannes on January 11th, has not yet been either officially published or discussed.   Nevar-theless,  the Italian government has just communicated it to the Powers invited to Genoa, - although it was under-stood at Cannes that this draft agenda was intended for the allies alone,, and that it would have to be studied and worked out in,detail by a small committee of five members,, consisting of delegates of the Powers repre-sented at Cannes.    In order that the &quot;French government may be able to take part in the work of the Genoa conference,  it is essential that a complete under-standing should be reached first With the British government, and then with the allied governments, respecting the interpretation which is to&apos; be given to the items of this agenda, respecting the questions which can or cannot be discussed thereunder, and respecting the precise instructions which are to be issued to the allied delegations in order to prevent any attempt at discussion inconsistent with these.objects.The/y
principles,/The first item of the draft agenda comprises: &quot;The examination o. ..the methods of putting into practice the principles contained in the Qann.es resolution or ,of, January 6th. 1922,&quot;    This rendering was substituted for a first draft which read:   &quot;Approved of the Pannes resolution of January 6th. 1922.&quot;    The object of this alteration, which was fully approved by the Supreme Council, was to demonstrate clearly that these principles must be considered as accepted in advance by the Powers taking part in the conference;    that they could not be the subject of discussion and that the only matter to be examined was tho method of putting them into practice -that is to say, their application.    llow this interpre-tation, as has already been stated, as that of the allies who are issuing the invitations to the conference;   it is not that of the Powers invited, who are not aware of it. It seems, then, indispensable that the governments, who took part in the Supreme Council, should agree to see that this point of view is adopted by all the governments invited, to the conference.     It is also indispensable that the powers, represented at the Supreme Council, should agree that the President of the Genoa conference, in his inaugural speech at the opening session of the conference, should take note that, by their very presence at the conference, all the powers there represented announce their complete   agreement on the fundamental
I41principles, recognised as the necessary basis of their colla-boration and the essential condition of their meeting.It is clear that a declaration of this kind, however useful&quot;it may he, will not suffice.     No doubt the governments, who wish to oppose   the conditions of January   6th. and who will endeavour simply to criticise them and to   discuss thorn, will not publish in advance their intention;   but they will introduce dangerous questions, they will manage, to slip through the gaps in the agenda if this agenda is not most carefully drawn up, and upon a plan which does not admit of discussion.It is necessary therefore, above all things, that the allied governments should agree upon the interpretation of .the principles contained in the Cannes resolution, sincenot only the putting into practice of these principles con-stitutes the first article of the Genoa agenda, but it is. also by the study of this matter that the conference must begin.it/
It is necessary, however, before reviewing these principles, to make a general observation of extreme im-portance.     The restriction contained in article 3 of the agenda, &quot;the: conditions necessary for the restora-tion of confidence without injury to existing treaties&quot; applies to the whole of the agenda and must dominate all the discussions at Genoa,     The existing treaties, that is to say, those which havo resulted from the Peace Conference, constitute the public lav/ of Europe;   it would be impossible to Injure them without profoundly disturbing the peace of Europe.    It would for instance be inadmissable that the Genoa conference should substitute itself for the Loague of Nations in the task which the treaties have attributed to the latter and which the latter alone is in a position to accomplish.     On the other hand, there will be present at the Genoa conference a considerable number of countries, which have taken no part in the treaties and which are not signatories thereto,    These countries include not only the so-called &quot;neutrals&quot;, but above all Russia.     The French government cannot in any circumstances agree that any of the clauses of these treaties should be discussed.   From this point of view the French Government can only refer to the declaration of Mr. Lloyd George at the Cannes conference;  &quot;It is not the obligations of tho Treaty, however precise they may be, that we have the least intention in the world of violating!&apos; At another time during the discussions Mr. Lloyd George also made known his opinion that the question of reparations must not be brought forward at Genoa.It/
It follows then that the neutrals and Russia ought -which they have not ygfc done - to recognise the existing treaties above mentioned:    it is necessary, therefore, that the British and French governments should first cc:ve to an agreement on this point, and the question is whether it would not he useful to make known immediately to the States, which are not signatories to the treaties, the nttitu.de adopted by the allied governments in this matter.The first of the principles inscribed in the Cannes resolution is that of the respect for the intern;&apos;.! sovereignty of states.    The allied Powers might thereby be held to undertake not to intervene in the internal organisation and government of Germany, notably in the event of the restoration of the HohenzoHerns or of any other military monarchy.    It would be the same in the case, of Hungary.-    It is therefore indispensable to know exactly what is meant by this principle of non-intervention,. Otherwise the clause might be very dangerous to the mair-tenance of peace in Europe,The second principle deals with the respect of foreign private property and interests,   The execution of this principle may result from the internal law of each country, but if this internal law does not exist, and if it cannot exist by reason of the internal legisla-tion, which every country has the right to maintain, ha/ving regard to the first principle regarding sovereignty,  it might be necessary to envisage international stipulations providing special elements of security.    Indeed one cannot believe that it is possible to respect the right of pro-perty,  if the right of property does not exist.    It must therefore be admitted that, in this case, the rights and interests of foreigners v/ill not be subject to local internr.&apos;.l law but will be governed by the national law of the foreigners themselves, and will be recognised accordingly in the country; from this
this one is compelled to contemplate a real system of capitulations,.Explanations are equally necessary on the subject of the third principle, the recognition of public debts, the undertaking to restore or make reparation.These debts being recognised and this undertakingbeing given,- the putting into practise of the principlefinding/must consist in/means cf payment.It may be noted that the allied governments have never denied their obligation to pay the debts which they have contracted between ^themaelveSo   Hot only the principle: pie of this obligation has been recognised, but these debts have already been the object of arrangements and of conversations3 which ought not to be compromised by a aemi-public discussions   On the contrary the debts, which certain states have up to date repudiated and which they are now expressly recognising by the acceptance of the Cannes resolution, are just those debts the recog-nition of which must result from the practical measures contemplated by this resolutionoIn so far as restitution and reparation are con-cefned it is necessary to know what reception will be given to the claims which the Russians will put forward on their side under this head*Under/
-f 8 *Under &quot;the same paragraph of the Cannes declaration appears the principle of the legal system guaranteeing the execution of contracts.    The putting into practise of this principle calls for observations similar to those which have been made in regard to the recognition of private property and interests.    If the internal law furnishes a judicial organisation and a procedure which is considered sufficiently protective of the rights of foreigners, the question comes under para-graph 5 of the draft programme.    But, if not, it will he necessary to try to withdraw foreigners from the local jurisdiction and to maintain them under their national jurisdiction.The fourth part of the Cannes resolution provides for the free disposal of adequate financial and mone-tary means of exchange.    The putting into practise of this principle entails first an undertaking on the part of certain states that they will, in their relations, or in their nationals relations with&apos;foreign countries, observe the monetary and financial systems commonly practised in the latter.    If all the powers are agreed to recognise and to apply the said monetary and finan-cial systems, the conditions upon which the various countries&apos; currencies and securities or paper currencies are to.be recognised and admitted, will be examinedunder/
under article 4 of the Genoa agenda.According to the fifth principle all nations must hind themselves to refrain from all propaganda subversive of order, and the established political system in other countries than their own.The putting into practice of this condition is only possible by conventional un.derta.king on the part of states, on the one hand not to take part in such propaganda directly or indirectly, and on the other hand, to put in force, within their territory, the legislation necessary to prevent it and to penalise the countries which take part in it.    It is possible that such an undertaking might be given at the Genoa conference, but it will be very difficult to ensure its observancecThe sixth condition of the Cannes declaration is &quot;the undertaking to refrain from aggression aga,inst neighbouring countries&quot;.The putting into practice of such a condition would naturally consist in the conclusion of conventions covering the undertaking in question.    This undertaking could not, however, withdraw from the allies their right in case of default by Germany in her reparation obli-gations,  to take under the Treaty of Versailles coercive measures which Germany will not be entitled to consideras/
aa hostile aots.  (paragraph. 18 of annex 2 of part 8 of the Treaty).    It must also he remembered that, in a general way, the settlement of the differences which may arise between states ia inscribed in the covenant of the League of Nations,   As regards Europe, with which alone the Genoa conference is concerned, the disputes which may break out between the nations of Europe will always interest at least one member of the League of Nations who ought then to refer to the covenant (articles 11 ,.12 u^nd 13 of the covenant) eIt does not seem possible to make innovations in the -substance of the Covenant or to provide for anything else than that, which exists at the moment*However, there is nothing to hinder the conclusion of special conventiono between states or groups of states, in order to give them a mutual guarantee of territorial integrity:    the group of the Little Entente, the agreements concluded or in process of conclusion between France and Belgium, France and England, and England and Belgium are example*The putting into practice of the principles con-tained in the Cannes resolution of the 6th January having thus been examined by the conference and the above points having been disposed of, we may now pass to the remainder of the said agenda.The second item of the draft agenda is &quot;thee stabl 1 whmen t/
-&quot;ll&quot;&quot;&quot;establishment of European peace on ^olld bases&quot; e This! article seems to refer directly to point 6 of the Cannae resolution;    if it refers to anything else, it would be necessary to define it and specify itoThe same is true of item 3, viz. &quot;essential conditions for the , re-e etabli establishment of ^confidence without injury to exi3ting treaties?Vo       The re-eatabllshment of confidence will be much more the result of a change in the mentality of countries which, like Germany and Russia, have hitherto worked to destroy the established order in Europe, instead of endeavouring to consolidate it.   It is therefore of the utmost necessity to define the scope of this article without losing sight of the restriction attached to it -that of &quot;not injuring existing treaties&quot;.The items which follow in the draft agenda refer more especially to technical matters,they comprise (IV) financial questions,  (V) economic and commercial question,  (VI) communications^These grave questions have already been considered by international conferences^   The financial conference of Brussels (October 1920) convened under the auspices of the League of Nations, studied a financial agenda which might usefully be consldsred again at Genoa* Experts could at once prepare the various headings of this agenda.- It must not be forgotten that the preparations for the Brussels conference lasted more than six months; it does not seem possible that a detailed and studiedagenda/H a
agenda can be drawn up for Genoa within so short a time as that by which we are now separated from the date of the proposed meeting.   If useful work is to be done at a meeting where so many and divergent interests will be involved, serious preparatory work of a certain duration is&apos; necessary.Among the questions concerning economics and communications, there are a certain number which have already been examined at the Porto Rose conference at which were represented last October the Succession States of the former Austro-Hungarlan Empire.   Here also the assistance of experts and preparatory work is necessary.   But if this programme, like that dealing with financial questions, is to be applied to Russia, it involves something very different.   It implies the establishment of a whole new order, or rather, the re-establishment of a whole old order, which it is neces-sary to conceive and to prepare.   At the beginning, it will be seen whether the Soviets are disposed to grant commercial facilities, legal and juridical guarantees * protection of industrial, literary and artistic property, consular status, entry and establishment of foreigners, without which trade cannot be resumed.   It will be the same with the financial conditions laid down in pointThus the various items to be included in the three last items of.the agenda, must at once be defined in the most exact manner so that the understanding between the allies and the other civilised countries of....
- 13 -of Europe may be complete when they find themselves in the presence of the chaos organised by the Soviets.It has already been observed that the time was very short for preparing a programme so vast and which affects so many peoples;   that is why it would seem necessary at all events to propose an adjournment of the meeting of the Genoa conference0 Three months at least should elapse before it can usefully meet, otherwise it will risk ending in disorder and confusion.FRENCH EMBASSY,February 5th, 1922.
