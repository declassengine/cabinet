mZ UNBMPL0Y51)On February 13th contingents of unemployed from Barking, Battersea, Bethnal Green, Beptford,  Sltham, Srith, Binsbury, Fulham, Hackney, Sast and \Vest Earn, Hammersmith. Islington, Lewisham, North Lambeth, Paddington, Poplar, Richmond, Shoraditch,  Southwark, Stepney, Tottenham   and &quot;althamstov;, totalling about 7,000, marched to Victoria Embankment and sent a deputation to the Ministry of Health: the demonstration was organised by the National Administrative Council of Unemployed and the deputation consisted of w. P. Andrews H. L. Hodge J, LyleG. MilesT. Redman and h. M. StrakerThe deputation expressed annoyance when informed that Sir Alfred Mond could not receive them and refused to state their case to a Poor law official: at about 3 p.m. the demonstrators marched from the Embankment to Byde Park where they were addressed by Holmes of Battersea and Steele of Kensington; they subsequently marched to their districts without disorder although it was noticed that several of the men threw away empty bottles and stones on the return march.Addressing a Battorsea meeting on the same evening Lyle said that it was apparent from the treatment meted out to the unemployed that afternoon that constitutional methods were a failure and that it was evident that they could no longer continue this line of conduct;    the only action the Government understood and was afraid of was physical force; he added that the Navy, Army and police were preserving the balance of power but that propaganda was being carried on among these bodies and there was great hope that these men would in the future realise that they are members of the class/
miclass which is now being kept in slavery.The National Administrative Council of Unemployedcontinues to organise demonstrations to Guardians&apos; Office On February 9th about 80 unemployed from Leyton andV/althamstow marched to the West Ham Board where they werejoined by contingents from Poplar and Stratford who swell!their number to 600:    drastic action in this case appears!.to. have beon prevented by the presence of Police.    On thesame day about 500 unemployed assembled outside the Souths!IGuardians&apos;  offices but tho Guardians refused to receive ai1deputation and the demonstrators marched away without disorder.    Mile ;Ind Guardians were visited on the same dojl about 1,000 unemployed and the deputation was eventually ejected from the Board room by the Police at the request oi:1 the Chairman.The current issue of &quot;Out of Work&quot;, the organ of theBetion&amp;l Administrative Council of Unemployed contains in tparticle on titled &quot;Rally to Poplar&quot;   the following paragrapl&quot;Conduct an extensive agitation, issue leaflets,I as on the national week of agitation, and march large! demonstrations to every Board of Guardians throughout j the country to demand the Poplar scale. Let your actif be sufficiently vigorous to convince the Guardians of! the unwisdom of a refusal. This must be done immediai before the Government have time to concentrate their forces for the attack.&quot;In a circular sent to secretaries of unemployedcommittees at the end of January, the secretary of the .NatiAdministrative Council of Unemployed wrote;&quot;You no doubt have read or heard of the scale of 1 relief granted to the Poplar Unemoloyed, viz. 40/-&apos; for man and wife plus the remainder of our National Demand! from the Guardians.    All unemployed organisations must! from now carry on an intensified agitation to secure &apos;&quot; this recent concession to Poplar.    If there is a unite) demand throughout the country we shall, in the near future, be another step nearer our National Demand fort . &quot;Work or Pull Maintenance&apos;.    Mow for the Big Push.&quot;.   IiffHe also instructed the committees to make arrangements, for divisional conferences which will be attended, if possilby/iNJ3
by the national organiser, W. Hannington: arrangements arebeing made to set up a women&apos;s section of the unemployedmovement, the organiser of which- is Mrs. Thring.last week the secretary also sent out the followingcircular on &quot;unemployed candidates for the Guardians&quot;:&quot;I am receiving several queries re the position of unemployed candidates for election to the office of Guardian, who are in receipt of relief.&quot;The Official and Legal answer is - That they are not eligible for candidature.    There is an Act which states that Paupers may not sit on Boards of Guardians.&quot;Taking into consideration the fact that the terra &apos;Pauper&apos; is not to be applied to the unemployed and the whole condition of affairs has altered considerably since this Act became law,    I must, on behalf of the National Organisation, urge all   Committees to press forward their nominations as quickly as possible with a view to create and stir up an agitation which will be national in character.&quot;Should all efforts in this direction prove unsuccessful, the next step is to insist that all Labour Party Candidates should accept and agree to the national Questionnaire which was sent out with the report of the Manchester Conference of Unemployed Organisation,  if they wish to obtain the support and votes of the organised unemployed.&quot;My Lancashire correspondents report that trade depression remains aoute in their area despite a slight decrease in the number of unemployed men:   the miners are particularly restless:   my correspondents have visited Atherton,. Bolt on, Leigh, Tyldesley and Wigan during the week and state that the miners in these districts say there will be a strike in a few weeks if something is not done to remedy the present state of affairs: a very sore point with these colliers is the high price of beer and tobacco.On February 5th a number of unemployed marched to St. Peter&apos;s Church, Levenshulme, to protest against an alleged suggestion that the scale of relief was to be lowered: the vicar&apos;s wife is vice-chairman of the Manchester Guardians; several men entered the church and attempted to make theirprotest/
protest but were removed.    On February 12th about SO unemployed again entered the church and interrupted, tho service: 5 were subsequently charged at Manchester Police  I Court with indecent behaviour; three were discharged and tuvtj bound over for six months.    The demonstrations are reported to have been organised by local communists.Liverpool communists are telling the unemployed that tt &quot;dole&quot; is to be stopped and there are indications that the extremists would welcome such an eventuality.    The unemployed on the other hand, view the end of February with apprehensiiThe Furness and District Council of Unemployed has received instructions from headquarters to set up a sub-division for Cumberland, Westmorland and the Furness divisions of Lancashire: efforts are to be made to organiso the unemployed in Cumberland and Westmorland.    The Stockport Committee is working in conjunction with ICoaley, -the divisional organiser,, who is also in touch with the Shipley Committee.It is reported that in Leicester there is discontent regarding tho non-payment for &quot;wet&quot; time of men cn relief schemes: it appears that men selected on Mondays, work for the next two days whatever the weather but those told off for Tuesday are not allowed to start if it is raining and are consequently not paid.The new unemployed committee in Derby contains 24 members 7 of whom are communists whb. are endeavouring to conceal their political views as the local unemployed are antagonistic to communism.There is a slight decroase in the number of unemployed J in Coventry where several factories are busier than they have been for some weeks&apos;past;   on February 8th a deputatif visited the Guardians who promised consideration - off the demands put forward;    a meeting off about 7 00 on the follow!day/ I
day expressed dissatisfaction with this result.From Birmingham a slight decrease in the unemployed figures is reported hut here also the extremists are making play with the possible discontinuance of the unemployment benefit.    Brain, the Midlands organiser&apos; of the national Administrative Council of Unemployed, has been paying particular attention to committees In the Black country and has expressed satisfaction with the result of. his labours: at Stirchley, however, he failed to induce the unemployed committee to confirm affiliation to the national organisation, his motion being lost by 45&apos; votes to S3.My &quot;Yorkshire correspondent reports the following., decreases in tho number of unemployed in his area;   Leeds and Armley 350, -&quot;Bradford 361, Hud dor sfi eld 331, Halifax&apos; 421, Bewsbury 162: :-Sheffield and Attercliffe show a slight increase in the. weekly returrh.   On February 8th about 200 unemployed obtained possession of the Wolstenholm Rail, Sheffield-,&apos;by &apos;a ruse but left voluntarily after a short time and did ho damage.On February 11th a conference of unempieye-d- organieationsin South Wales and the West of England was held&quot;&apos;in Cardiff:it was claimed that 40,000 organised unemployed&quot;--Were- -&apos;represented;   the following resolutions were&apos;passed:. 1.      Pledging the organised unemployed to&apos; support only these Labour Party   municipal or parliamentary&apos; candidates1-who- made a specific declaration to support the policy laid down by the unemployed.2.       Supporting the dispatch of a questionnaire &quot;to labour candidates&apos; regarding their views towards the - - loans clause in relief schemes-It was also decided to send representatives to a meeting of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation executive on February 13th:    the executive, however, refused to receive the deputation which included two men who are working for the disruption of the Federation.:        My correspondent reports tnat during a week there hasbeen/
been an unemployed disturbance in Falkirk and another in Greenock: in the first case a threatened eviction was- Ifthe cause and in the second the Parish OfficeB were invade; *   the demandB of the National Administrative Council ofmUnemployed are now being put forward by unemployed groups in the West of Scotland and there is some dissatisfaction regarding the varying scales of relief.THE COMMUNISTSWhile no definite decision has been reaohed regarding the labour-communist &quot;coalition&quot; it is reported that the Labour Party has issued a questionnaire asking whether the communists, are &quot;prepared for the result of parliamentary action&quot; and insisting that any answer must be endorsed by I the Communist Conference.Arrangements are being made to hold t:iis &quot;policy conference&quot; in London on March 18th and 19th:   parliaments^ municipal and industrial policy will be discussed, also &quot;theses embodying the decisions of the 3rd Congress of the Third International:   these theses, which are of a highly subversive nature, are now being disoussed by branches whicl are already acting on certain olauses.For some time British Communists have feared that theii party would be made illegal and have in consequence built up an underground organisation:    fairly complete evidence regarding this machinery, which includes a secret printing ^ress, is in possession of this department.    Some 5,000 oonies of number 5 of the &quot;Communist International&quot; (the Moscow organ of the Third International which is printed in several languages) have been printed on this press and - distributed with great precaution to such members of the party as are considered absolutely trustworthy:   the despa^of/
of these books from tho press to some ton agents was notified in code and on receipt of the parcels these agents cycled or travelled personally to branches to deliver small quantities:    in Birmingham eash member is required to produce his copy every Thursday in order to prevent leakage. This book, whioh -closely resembles the French edition and boars a false imprint, is now being examined:   it will be remembered that tho entry into the United Kingdom of the &quot;Communist International&quot;,  the first number of which figured in the Inkpin. trial, is prohibited and to this fact is no doubt due. the caution observed by the Communist Party in regard to its publication and distribution.    It is of interest to note that the secret press, whioh is situated in Scotland, is working in con junction with the &quot;Kankpelnis&quot; group jff Lithuanian Bolsheviks in Lanarkshire.    Among the people -implicated are two men who have an engineering business - employing 15-SO men and whose &quot;agent for Esthonia&quot; is Tom Bell, the national organiser of the Communist Party; a shop steward, who with Pick Beech was one of the few revolutionaries who had dealings with . Johnnie Walker, formerly the chief agent of the Third International; a shop steward in London, who has been entrusted with special work for the Third - International; and a member of the Industrial Workers, of. the /World in Liverpool wh..o &apos;has&apos;-smuggled men to&quot; Ireland and the States.    The last man has used for his stowaway service., -: money which was collected by the Communist Unemployed Committee in Liverpool. Messages between these agents are usually sent or carried in code, under&apos;cover&apos;of one or more aliases, to addresses at which they do not reside. v-An important part in the work of- the organisation is the passing of couriers in and out of this coiuitry: one such is at - present/
present waiting for a ship at a Welsh port and another is to be passed from a Northern port to the States.   Only a few of the Communist officials are aware of this organisation and although the wages of the Press Section are paid by the principal in London, he appeers to receive his funds directly from a Bolshevik agent.   The secrecy surrounding Communist funds was emphasised by one of the party members who recently informed my corresnondent that the pay of many people was not officially shown on the books because if toey were examined the expenditure of the Party could be shown to exceed its income by a considerable margin.Communist headquarters have issued orders for the immediate formation of a women&apos;s section, in accordance with; the instructions contained in the Moscow thesis on &quot;Work among Women&quot;.    Minnie Birch, secretary of the Hammersmith branch of the Party, is in charge of organisation in the London area and is arranging an inaugural meeting at Gray&apos;s IInn Road on February 24th:    in a circular sent to one of my if1correspondents she writes: ;&quot;It is definitely laid down in the Thesis that steps must be taken to extend the work of the Conraunistjjyj Party amongst the proletarian women in evtry country. For this purpose a women&apos;s movement must exist within every Communist Party... Special machinery within the Communist Party must &quot;be built up for the purpose of educating masses of women workers in the spirit of communism, and of drawing them ints the revolutionary movement to take an active part in the struggle for tho establishment of the Proletarian Dictatorship...&quot;The Co-operative movement, the unemployed movement the Labour Party and the Trade Unions offer great possibilities.   We must oonsider in what branches of industry our immediate work lies,   Distributive work (including a great many shop assistants) clothing, dyeifl women pithead workers, the fishing industry, agrioulture workers (i.e. farm servants, fruit pickers, potato diggers, etc) women in hospitals and institutions, all these branches must have consideration.    There is the question of women&apos;s activity in the Co-operative Guilds and women in the Homes ...&quot;We must learn to deport ourselves as potential soldiers in the Red Army, for later women will be required no less than men for military service in defence &quot;of the Workers Republic ...&quot;Helen/

V. Letkie: some of the Birmingham Communists have made violent speeches during the week and the Chief Constable is considering prosecution.Robert Stowart, who is the prospective Communist candidate for Caerphilly, made a comparatively mild speech at Pontypool on February 12th:    he also spoke at Blaina and Abertillery.Robert Foulis, who was formerly Scottish organiser of tho Rod International of Labour Unions, is reported by Poet to have been nominated as parliamentary candidate for Leith Burghs by the local Labour Party.    Tho Mothorwell and Wishaw Communists, who have adopted Walton Newbould as their candidate, have warned the local Labour supporters that therewill/    j
will bo trouble if they interfere in the contest.    The secretary of the Storehouse Branch of the Communist Party has requested tho Scottish organiser to furnish a &quot;list of questions suitable for heckling both labour and coalition candidates. &quot;Headquarters continue to send sums of money to Glasgow weekly:  27 for salaries and  11 for organising were despatched by Beet on February 11th.Arthur Rcades editor of &quot;Free Oxford&quot;, has sent an urgent appeal to MacManus for funds with which to revise his paper:    he has also accepted Palme Dutfs offer of the post of advertisement manager on &quot;The Labour Monthly&quot;.Lick and Charles Beech, Jack Apploby and Jim Quinton have returned to this country; the Beechs were sent from Hamburg by the British Consul as &quot;distressed British seamen.&quot;Mac Man us,&apos; Bell, Pollitt and Watkins ere still in Russia and Patrick Lavin is on his way back.A circular letter, headed &quot;Ii.U.R, Rank&apos;and File Committee&quot;, addressed from the office of the Young Communist League at 35, Gray&apos;s Inn Road, London, and signed.&quot;W.

THE INDUSTRIAL C0L01JY OF KUZBASIn the autumn of last year an arrangement was madewbetween tho Russian Government and a group of revolutionaries for the exploitation of Kadijdinsky plant and a number of enterprises in tho Kaznotsh basin: the managing board of tho industrial oolony is composed as follows:Russia     -     W. D. Eaywood (American I.W.W. ) J. H.  BeyerAmerica   -     H. S. Calvert Tom Barker&apos;     - &apos; : &apos; $Continent -   S. J. RutgersEngland     -     Tom MannN. WatkinsIThe agreement with tho Soviet Government stipulates that!the colony constitute a Soviet State enterprise, the entire 1output of which belongs to tho Soviet Government: that thecolony shall work not less than two years and shall undertaketo transport from America to Russia 8,800 thoroughly skilled workers and a technical staff for the Kuanetsh basin and 3,O0imen for tho Nadijdinsky plant.The scheme was outlined by Tom Mann in tho December iakmof the Amalgamated&apos;Engineering Union monthly journal but he  1&apos; warned intending emigrants that the country was &quot;not a ready fmade Paradise&quot;: each colonist has to provide about.  75 tooover expenses and as a contribution to the &quot;development fund&quot;:    this faot alone will probably prevent any number of english workers going to Russia, but a few are entertainingthe idea and William Leslie has offered his services &quot;in a technical oapacity&quot;.   From the evidencs available there seemslittle doubt that the colonists will work under conditions ofconsiderable hardship and that the Soviet control will bedespotic in the extreme. .IRISH/
IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITY  IN THE UNITED CTOSOMThe growing troubles along tho Northern border of the Irish Free State end the increased activities of Republican and advaneod Labour men are being viewed with alarm by moderate Irishmen,    They regard all this as part of tho settled policy of De Valora and his supporters and are afraid of them attempting to re-establish terrorism and to nrevent tho poeole of Ireland, giving freo expression to their wishes at the coming elections.Tho recent gatherings of the Irish Solf-Det ermiuation Lcaguo have not been at all successful from the promoters point of view-    The meeting which took placo in Trafalgar Square last Sunday was small and lacked enthusiasm and the hotter class Irish residents were conspicuous by their absence--    The main talkers were naid officials of the Irish Self-Determination League.    Any reference to the disputes and quarrels between the Free Staters and Republicans was avoided at tho mooting.Art 0&apos;Brien and his immediate followers had tho wind taken out of their sails by the release of some of the prisoners on the eve of the meeting; the Government action thus robbing them of much of their thunder and one of their main planks for uniting any considerable number of supporters.P. J. Kelly, the President of the League, has bo en in touch with Saklatvala, tho Indian Labour extremist. They have a common ground in working for the independence of both countries from the domination of England.The North of England continues to remain quiet and the further release of prisoners is largely allaying any feeling of irritation that exists.Be Valera&apos; s new campaign has not yet found its way to scotland/
Scotland as the Republican leaders are so busy in Irelan that they cannot spare the time to send any speakers out of the country and the local speakers in Scotland are not of sufficient importance to hold a crowd.Sean 5t oh in ham has been twice asked to visit Glasgoi but he has informed Maurice Frieze that ho must be in Dublin for the meeting of the Dail on the 28th February but he hopes that if they can arrange a few meetings in March he will try and find time to address them.   The Scottish Sinn Feiners did not wait for a reply before arranging a meeting and under the auspices of the Gaelic Athletic Association they have announoed a grand concert and lecture at the Red Cross Rail, Errol Street, Glasgow on Monday the 27th February at 7.45 &apos;o.m. to be addressed by Sean litchinham, T. D. , Minister of Fisheries, Dail Sireann. &apos;There are indications that it will not be long before a split occurs amongst the Glasgow Sinn Feiners.Dean Ryan, Tom White and Sean Ferguson have already severed themselves from the Sxtremista and here and ther outside Glasgow many of the clubs are growing restive and are considering breaking aray should the Dublin Ard Fheis decide in favour of Arthur Griffith.
