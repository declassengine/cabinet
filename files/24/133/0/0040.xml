A merchant vessel must be ordered to submit to visit and search to determine its character before it can be seined.A merchant vessel must not be attacked unless it refuse to submit to visit and search after warning, or to proceed as directed after seizure.A merchant vessel must not be destroyed unless the crew and passengers have been first placed in safety.2. The belligerent submarines are not under any circumstances exempt from the universal rules above stated; and if a submarine cannot capture a merchant vessel in conformity with these rules the existing law of nations requires it to desist from attack and from seizure and to permit the merchant vessel to proceed unmolested.ii.The Signatory Powers invite all other civilised Powers to express their assent to the foregoing statement of established law so that there may be a clear public understanding throughout the world of the standards of conduct by which .th.e public opinion of the world is to pass judgment upon future belligerents.III.The Signatory Powers, desiring to ensure the enforcement of the humane rules of existing law declared by them with respect to attacks upon and the seizure and destruction of merchant ships,
further declare that any person in the service of any Power who shall violate any of those rules, whether or not such person is under orders of a governmental superior, shall be deemed to have violated the laws of war and shall be liable to trial and punishment as if for an act of piracy and may be brought to trial before the civil or military authorities of any Power within the jurisdiction of which he may be found.IV.The Signatory Powers recognise the practical impossibility of using submarines as commerce destroyers without violating, as they were violated in the recent war of 1914-1918, the requirements universally accepted by civilised nations for the protection of tho lives of neutrals and non-combatants, and to the end that the prohibition of the use of submarines as commerce destroyers shall be. universally accepted as a part of the law of nations they now accept that prohibition as henceforth binding as between themselves and they invite all other nations to adhere thereto.V.The use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and all analogous liquids, materials or devices, having been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilised world, and a prohibition of such use having been declared in. Treaties to which a majority of the civilised Powers are parties,The Signatory Powers, to the end that this prohibition shall be universally accepted as a part of international law binding alike the conscience and practice of nations, declare their assent to such prohibition, agree to be bound thereby as between themselves and invite all other civilised nations to adhere thereto.VI.The present Treaty shall be ratified as soon as possible in accordance with the constitutional methods of the Signatory Powers and shall, take effect on the deposit of all the ratifications, which, shall take place at Washington.The Government of the United States of: America will transmit to all the Signatory Powers a certified copy of the proces-vcrbal of the deposit of ratifications.The present Treaty, of which, the French and English texts are both authentic, shall remain, deposited in the archives of the Government of the United States of America, and duly certified copies thereof will be transmitted by that Government to each of the Signatory Powers.VII.The Government of the United States of America will further transmit to each of the Non-Signatory Powers a duly certified copy of the present Treaty and invite its adherence thereto.Any Non-Signatory Power may adhere to the present Treaty by communicating an Instrument of Adherence to the Government of the United States of America, which will thereupon transmit to each of the Signatory and Adhering Powers a certified copy of each Instrument of Adherence.In faith whereof, the above-named Plenipotentiaries have signed the present Treaty.Done at the City of Washington, the        day of February,&apos; 1922.
