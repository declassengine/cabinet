)0 k B I M 3 T x TH!S; SITUATION IB EGYPT aI have received from Lord ,/interton tho following very sensible and interesting memorandum written a fortnight ago in Sgypt by a group of gentlemen who are said to know that country thoroughly but who do not Rrish at this juncture to disclose their names,,flntd,) to&apos;. S, 0,:
-    171 2The Curaon Scheme, coupled vrith the risplanatory letter Of Lord -&quot;llenby to the Sultan dated 3rd Beoomber 1921 enunciated a policy of reasonable concession with firm resistance to extremism,, which policy had been steadily advocated by the majority of persons in iiigypt, having any knowledge of the subject.Its principal merit was to declare in plain language to what extent the British Government intended to maintain its hold over Egypt, and the language employed was intended to leare no doubt la.--the minds of the public as to the policy definitely adopted.It produced an excellent of foot *   Some little opposition and trouble had to be expected, but anything like the trouble foretold by quasi-a ufchor it. lea on the Egyptian Question, showed no signs of coming into being.It is true that a line of polioy taken by certain portions of the home prees, whioh showed nervousness,  did to somo extent attomsato the. exoellent effect produced.   But though extremists wore angry, the great majority which composes the would*-bq mod era-tea, were, gradually rallying uncor the influen-ee of suoooasivo measures showing the Government&apos;s intention to govern, such at? the deportation of kiagloul and his ocmpa-nionsj the closure of a certain number of newspapers as a punishment for tho publication of violent articles cal culat eo. to inflame the passions of the orowd, etc.It is generally expected that in tho event of the refasal of the Egjrptians to form a minil try tho British Authorities would oontinuo to take mousuree for the administration of the country without native ministers, and a few more weeks of this regime would have gradually brought about a state of 1calm and soberminded reasonableness in the masses; the hesi-tating majority, at last con vino edl on whioh side lay autho-rity would havo taken hearyof graoe and openly shown their
acquiescence at least. There were signs that this frame of mind was being more rapidly attained than had been expected. Later on this could have been followed by a measure of reasonable self-government and with that, in so far as it is possible the settlement of the Egyptian question would have been effected.

For some reasons not yet apparent supreme importance seemed to be attached to the formation of a Cabinet with a hurried chase after an Egyptian ministry, risking the loss of all the advantages which had gradually become more noticeable as a result of the firm policy adopted.

There is good reason, to think that there were certain ex-ministers who were quite prepared to form a ministry unconditionally, but Sarwat Pacha appears to have been considered the only possible candidate.

He naturally took advantage of his position.

Now Sarwat Pacha is a Turk with his wiliness sharpened by his Egyptian surroundings, and a very apt pupil of Rushdi Pacha with whom he is in close relation.

Sarwat Pacha put forward conditions to his acceptance of the ministry. Various accounts of these conditions have been reported, but taking the admitted version as the true one, the result reached can be summed-up thus :

There was to be substantially an abandonment of the position taken by the F.O. in the Curzon Scheme and this in return for mere acceptance of office by Sarwat Pacha, with no corresponding undertaking by him for himself, the Egyptian Government, or the Egyptian ?eople. In other words though the F.O. had declared that concessions would be made only if accepted by the Egyptians, the Sarwat manoeuvre was to obtain concessions without acceptance, and afterwards to go on asking for more. Thus the very object pursued by the liberal press and others in England would be defeated, as there would be nothing in the nature of a permanent settlement. It is doubtful if Sarwat Pacha over really intended to form a ministry, and it is more 

than
than suspected that ho only intended to pose as a patriot having&quot;&apos; brought tho Jritish authorities to their knoeOo    For whatever ho the outcome, and whether the arra ugement were accepted by London or not, and whother a ministry aotuaily did coma into being or not; by tho very fact of any discussion of terms which were oaloulatod to make a breach into tho dofinitoncss of the statement of policy by tho Foreign Office, the broach was bade. ri:hat is tho doplornblo outcome of the discuss! ons in Cairo having in viovi the formation of a ministry at fatal sacrifice of principle as originally laid down In tho Proclamation *On top of that osno the official communiquo published by the Foreign Office on January 30th, which has locally boon considered as apologetic in t,nc, and interpreted as a partial climb down-..In add.ition,,the sudden release of tho vfcfd members   has given colour to this view.In narked contract with tho firmness shown in deporting Zagloul, suppressing violent newspapers, all political die-cushion, -etc. exaggerated versions of Sarwat Pacha1s conditions have boon allowed to be published, without official correction?The fact of discussion any conditions at all, tho acceptance of which would have entailed a partial abandonment of the policy declared threo months ago by what is known as the Allonby letter, was bad enough, but to allow a wholly exaggerated version of those terms to go uncontraaifctofc     is a great deal worse,    It is inexcusable in those who ought to know the effect it would produce upon the public mind.The result of the policy is clear:Either tho British Government had to swallow its words end look foolish in the sight of the whole world, thus giving a heavy blow to British prestige, or tho authorities here w ou!3 appear to be elding with the Egyptians against the British Government.    In either ease tho object for which the Pacha5s..- ?.,-* ma n o o u vr c /
manoeuvre was designed vas attained nanoly to belittle the British, and to detract from tho firmnosr and dofinitenesa of the Foreign Office, statement of policy in December 1921.It is nc-o5ctary. to warn the authorities in L on dor..: of the present danger.    It .1s obvious there &quot;is a lack of tho deeper knowledge of the problem, ability to see through the manoouvr of Orientals.- and above all strength of purpeeo.The one unpardonable crime in the governance of an Eastern country is tho adoption of a wobbly uncertain lino of oonduet and the 3.11 d taken has resulted in giving tho appearance of weakness and uncertainty to British policy.
