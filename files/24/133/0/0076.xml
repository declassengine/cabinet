Third Report of theCommittee on National Expenditure.To the Eight Hon. Sir Robert S. Horne, G.B.E, K.C., M.P., Chancellor of the Exchequer.Sir,We beg to submit our Third Report, in which we deal with the 60 Votes which were outstanding after our Second Interim Report, and which account for an expenditure of approximately  102,000,000.The Provisional Estimates for Ordinary Supply Services for 1922/23 amounted to  528,000.000, showing a reduction effected by the Departments themselves of  75,000,000 upon the original Estimates for 1921/22.It is these Estimates amounting to  528.000,000 which we have been examining, and we have dealt with them as follows :  In our First Interim Report we dealt withServices amounting to   ... ... ...        390,000,000*In our Second Interim Report we dealt withServices amounting to   ... ... ... 18,000,000Irish Votes which we are not examining amountto      ... ... ... ... ... 17,500,000In this our Third Report we have dealt withServices amounting to   ...        .... ...       102,500,000t528,000,000In this Third Report, we have also dealt with 5 Votes in respect of &quot; Aftermath of the War Services,&quot; which come under the heading of &quot; Special Expenditure,&quot; and we have reported on one special subject which has been prominently before us throughout our review of Government Expenditure, viz., &quot; Pay.&quot;We have, as before, divided this Report into various parts according to the subject matter of the Votes under consideration, as follows, full details being given in the index : Colonial Office, Colonial Services and Middle East Group...

PART YIII.COLONIAL AND MIDDLE-EASTERN SERVICES.The Provisional Estimates submitted to the Committee of the cost of these Services in 1922/23 amount to  15,128,532 as compared with an expenditure of  841.364 upon the Services existing in 1913/14.	1913/14 Audited Expenditure.	1921/22 Estimates.	1922/23 Provisional Estimates.Colonial Office Colonial Services Middle-Eastern Services   ..	  60,169 &quot;781,195 Non-existent	  1,184,104 2,067,027 27,217,000	  372,764 1,752,068 13,003,700Total	841,364	30,468,131	15,128,532We proceed to deal with these Services seriatim.
COLONIAL OFFICE ESTIMATES.1913/14 Audited Expenditure1921/22 Estimates1922/23 Provisional Estimates60,169 1,184,104 372,7641. The Estimates for 1921/22 include a Supplementary Estimate of  330,000 voted last Autumn for the provision of Free Passages in connection with the Overseas Settlement Scheme, making the provision on that account in the current year  980,000. Since the Provisional-Estimates were submitted the Colonial Office have furnished a revised Estimate for 1922/23 of  928.866, the large increase over the Provisional Estimate being due mainly to additional provision for the Overseas Settlement Scheme.2. Overseas Settlement.In 1919 the Government decided that approved ex-Service men and women who wdshed to settle within the Empire Overseas should be given free Third Class Passages for themselves and their Dependants. Under the arrangements finally made applications were required to be lodged before the 31st December, 1921, and passages taken before the 31st December, 1922.This Scheme was part of the general arrangements for affording ex-Service men and women opportunities for settling in civil life after demobilisation. The total expenditure up to the 31st March, 1921 (including certain expenditure for assisting the emigration of non-ex-Service men and women out of employment) was  750.000, and the provision for 1921/22, including the administrative expenditure, is  1,037,675.The provision for 1922/23 is asked for to complete the Scheme. We are informed that  200,000 included in the Provisional Estimate for the cost of Free Passages was a tentative Estimate only and that it is now considered by the Colonial Office that, in view of the large number of applicants whose names are on the books of the Overseas Settlement Office,  750,000 may be required.The Treasury are disposed to think that this is an over estimate and that a provision of  500,000 for Free Passages should be sufficient to fulfil the obligations of the Government under the Scheme.3. Empire Settlement.We understand that proposals have been laid by the Secretary of State for the Colonies before the Government, involving a further expenditure amounting in 1922/23 to  1,245,000, for initiating a general measure of Empire Settlement which is intended to carry out and in some respects to extend a Scheme agreed in principle with the Dominion Prime Ministers last summer. We understand that this Scheme w-as accepted by the Government &quot; on the understanding that caution should be exercised in regard to any immediate expenditure.&quot; As no provision is made in the Estimates before us for this purpose, we offer no observations beyond pointing out that the question for decision would appear to be how much the State can afford at the present time, for an object which is, in itself, probably desirable. The Scheme agreed in 1921 was roughly to be financed as to 50 per cent, by this country and 50 per cent, by the Dominions. We are informed that the only sum so far voted by the Dominions is  160.000 by the Commonwealth of Australia, which is the measure of any immediate Exchequer liability.4. Administrative Expenditure.The staff of the Department was 214 on the 1st August, 1914. The staff proposed for the 1st April, 1922, is 413. The increased number includes a staff of 98 employed in the Overseas Settlement Office and the staff of 20 of the Middle-Eastern Department now transferred to this Vote. Apart from these new Services the staff of the Colonial Office proper has increased from 206 to 295.   This increase is accounted
for by the greater volume of work clue to taking over the former German Colonies and to the development of the Colonies and Protectorates, particularly in East Africa, and we are unable to criticiseit.CONCLUSION.As a result of our consideration, we are of opinion that the Net Estimate of the Colonial Office should be fixed at  678,866, instead of  928,866 in the revised Estimate, being an increase of  306,102 over the Provisional Estimate.

Cyprus: Grant-in-Aid,  50,000.In 1878 Great Britain undertook to pay to Turkey an annual sum subsequently calculated at  92,800 a year to compensate the Porte for the actual loss of its revenue from the Island, on the average of the five preceding years. This amount was charged in 1882 by Order-in-Council on the Consolidated Revenues of Cyprus. It has not, however, in fact, been paid to Turkey, but has been applied towards the service of the Turkish Guaranteed Loan of 1855, in respect of which Turkey has been in default. This arrangement appears to accord with the recognised principle that Territories which have formed part of the Turkish Dominions should continue to bear their due share of the Ottoman Debt.. Cyprus has not, however, in practice been required to bear this charge in full. Grants-in-Aid were given from time to time from the Imperial Exchequer of varying amounts, until in 1910 the British Government agreed to ask Parliament to vote in future a fixed annual grant of  50,000 a year so long as the obligation to provide the  92,800 continued.In recent years Cyprus has had a substantial surplus of revenue over expenditure, and by the 31st March, 1920, had accumulated a Reserve Fund of about  200,000, of which about  80,000 has since been spent upon special purposes.3. Tanganyika (late German East Africa): Grant-in-Aid,  800,000.A further proposal has now been put forward to increase the grant to  850,000.This Territory suffered considerably from the war, and assistance from the British Exchequer has been necessary since 1920, when a grant of  330,000 was provided. In 1921/22 grants have been made of  164,000 to meet the realised [7802] C1913/14 Audited Expenditure ... ...        781,1951921/22 Estimates      ... ... ...      2,067,0271922/23 Provisional Estimates ... ...      1,752,0681. The increase over 1913/14 is due to the requirements of Tanganyika territory ; (formerly German East Africa) and to provision for development loans to Uganda and Bhodesia.    Since the Provisional Estimates for 1922/23 were submitted the Colonial Office have furnished a revised Estimate of  1,779,120, which is made up
deficit for 1920/21, and  750,000 by way of loan to coyer a deficit on ordinary expenditure of  456,000 and to provide for capital expenditure and a working balance. The British Taxpayer has therefore made grants of  500,000 and a loan of  750,000.For 1922/23 the Territory&apos;s Estimates show a deficit on ordinary expenditure of  324,000, and capital expenditure of  378,000 is proposed, making a total of  702,000 in excess of revenue, to meet which a further grant of  800,000 is now asked.We are informed that the Customs revenue is estimated at  275,000 only, although the actual revenue for 1920/21 was  225,000 and the duties were increased in August, 1921, by about 50 per cent. No other increased taxation is proposed, although the Native Hut and Poll Taxes are said to work out at Is. 9i. per head of the Native population only, as compared with 5s. M. per head in Kenya. It would seem possible, therefore, in due course to obtain an increased revenue.In the circumstances, the Grant-in-Aid of  800,000 proposed by the Colonial Office appears to call for close scrutiny. It has been urged before us that capital expenditure in this Territory, as in other British Protectorates in East Africa, will materially promote their development, and that the provision of funds by the British Taxpayer would be a sound investment. We would, however, observe that the British Exchequer has, in present circumstances, no surplus funds for investments of this nature. At the present time, the provision of Public Funds must necessarily be limited to urgent requirements, and the development of these countries ought, in our opinion, to be regulated mainly by the ability of the local Governments and private undertakings to raise funds independently. As in the case of this country, these Territories ought, we think,&apos; to deny themselves expenditure, even, on laudable objects, until by rigid economy and taxation they have balanced their Budgets.We recommend that the Grant-in-Aid to be provided for Tanganyika in 1922/23 should be limited to  600,000 to meet the deficit on ordinary expenditure which cannot be met by increased revenue and the most urgent capital requirements, and that it should take the form of a loan and not of a free grant.4. Wei-hai Wei: Grant-in-Aid,  2,300.We understand that in connection with the arrangements under discussion at Washington, it is proposed that this Territory should revert to China. Its surrender will effect savings on Naval and Military expenditure and Telegraph subsidies, as well as on this Vote. Pending the final ratification of the proposed arrangements, the Grant-in-Aid provided in these Estimates ( 2,300) must stand.5. Nyasaland: Grant-in-Aid,  86,050.This loan grant is proposed to assist the Protectorate to meet payments arising under a guarantee in respect of interest and Sinking Fund given for reasons of policy in connection with the construction of the Trans-Zambesia Railway, a line under construction in Portuguese East Africa connecting the Nyasaland Railway system with the port of Beira. The guarantee payments are eventually repayable out of the profits of the Railway. It does not appear to be possible at the present time to reduce the assistance required.6. Uganda: Grant-in-Aid,  150,000.In 1920 the Government undertook to provide a loan of  1,000,000 at 5 per cent, for the development of the Protectorate over a period of five years. The loan is to be repaid out of the proceeds of a loan to be raised by Uganda on her own account as soon as possible after the 31st March, 1925. In 1920 the Protectorate was barely self-supporting, and did not appear to be1 capable of providing for development works .out of its own revenue, or of raising a lean independently for the purpose. Since that time, owing to savings on current expenditure and growth of revenue, the Protectorate has been able to accumulate a surplus estimated to amount on the 31st December, 1921, to  418,000. On the otner hand, Uganda has a large liability to the Imperial Government for her share of the war expenditure in East Africa, which may amount to about  800,000, but no definite arrangements have yet been made for the discharge of this obligation. The Uganda Government has agreed to reduce the loan instalment due from the British Exchequer under the 1920 arrangement, to  150,000 next year, on the understanding that the total sum of  1,000,000 will eventually be provided.   We consider, however, that in view of the
strength of the Protectorate^ financial position, if the Exchequer is called upon to provide capital for development purposes, arrangements should be made at the same time for the liquidation of the War expenditure liability.7. Somalilancl: Grant-in-Aid,  72,080.A loan grant of  72,080 is proposed to meet the excess of administrative expenditure over local revenue. We are informed that it will be necessary to increase this grant by  85,000 to enable the Protectorate to discharge its liabilities to the Air Ministry for the balance of the cost of the operations against the Mullah in 1919/20.The expenditure of the Protectorate for 1922/23 is estimated at  150,827 of which  70,938 is for Military and Police. It is considered by the Colonial Office that, owing to the circumstances of the country and the small Military force with which it is held, it is impossible to raise additional taxation. Prior to the War the occupation was limited to the coast, but it is not now considered that coastal concentration would lead to economy. There does not appear to be any immediate prospect that the Protectorate can be made self-supporting. So long as the British occupation is continued it is probable that substantial contributions will have to be made by the British Taxpayer.8. Rhodesia: Grant-in-Aid,  150,000:The provision of  150,000 is the second instalment of a loan which the Govern-ment has undertaken to provide to meet the urgent capital requirements of the territory pending the establishment of self-Government. We understand that arrangements are now being made to bring self-Government into early operation, and that the advances now being made by the British Exchequer will be repaid by the new administration out of loans to be raised by them in the open market.9. Niger Company Purchase Annuity:  44,475.This amount is an instalment of the annuity expiring in 1928, required to repay with interest at 3 per cent, per annum, the sum of  820,000 advanced by the National Debt Commissioners in 1900 for the purchase of the rights and properties of the Royal Niger Company under the Royal Niger Company Act, 1899.It was provided by that Act that, until the advances made thereunder had been repaid to the Exchequer with interest, the excess of the receipts from the territories administered by the company over the expenses of administration should be paid into the Exchequer, save so far as those sums might with Treasury approval be applied towards the development of the Territories. No payments on account of interest or repayment of capital have in fact been made to the British Exchequer. Prior to 1918 Nigeria received assistance from the Exchequer. We understand that in recent years there has been a substantial surplus of revenue over expenditure and that the surplus assets of the Colony amounted on the 31st December, 1920, to  3,296,789, more than half of which came from recoupment from loan funds of expenditure on capital works previously charged to general revenue. It would appear to be a matter for enquiry whether, in these circumstances, the recent Exchequer Grants-in-Aid should not have been refunded.The Colony raised loans, for development purposes, of  6,200,000 in 1919, and  3,000;000 in 1921. Owing to the depression of trade there has been a severe drop of revenue and the Colony is now faced with a deficit.In the circumstances the Colony would not appear to be in a position to make repayment, at the present time, of the sums due to the Exchequer under the Act of 1899, but we recommend that as soon as the financial conditions improve, definite arrangements should be made for the discharge of the liability.10. Vganda Railway Annuities :  319,112.This amount represents instalments of the annuities terminating in 1925 required to repay advances amounting to  5,502,000, made by the National Debt Commissioners for the construction of the Uganda Railway. In this case it was part of the original arrangements that the surplus receipts of the railway should be paid into the Exchequer until the debt was discharged. The Railway has been administered by the Government of the British East Africa Protectorate, now Kenya Colony and Protectorate, the finances of which, including the Railway receipts, have not been hitherto more than self-supporting. The Colony has recently raised a loan of  5,000,000 for development purposes. It also owes the Imperial Government [78021 C 2
sums estimated to exceed  3,000,000 in respect of war expenditure in East Africa, and arrangements have been made to liquidate this debt.We are informed that in these circumstances the Treasury have agreed that for the present the Railway revenue should continue to be applied towards the general expenses of the Colony. We make no recommendation, but we suggest that the fact that the Railway is an asset of the British Taxpayer should not be lost sight of.CONCLUSIONS.As a result of our consideration, we are of opinion: (1.) That the assistance which can be given by the British Exchequer to our African Dependencies must be limited to the most urgent requirements which those Dependencies can show themselves to be unable to meet out of their own resources.(2.) That the Estimates for Colonial Services for 1922/23 should be reduced from  1,752,068 to  1,664,120.
MIDDLE EASTERN SERVICES.9,200,000The Colonial Secretary explained to us the policy under which, in substitution for a British Administration supported by large British Forces, an Arab State is being established, in whioh order will be maintained by Native Levies, with the assistance of the Air Force. Thirty-nine out of the fifty battalions which were in the country a year ago, have now been withdrawn, and further reductions are proceeding. As a result of this policy and the accession of King Feisal, the country is more tranquil than before. The object in view is the establishment of a Native State on a firm footing, with a consequent relief of the British burden. It is now considered that the British expenditure in 1922/23 in this country should not be more than  8,000,000 or  8,500,000, and if all goes well the cost may be further reduced, falling to  5,000,000 or  6,000,000 in the succeeding year. It is necessary, however, to point out that, so long as the British Government remains responsible for the defence of Iraq against external aggression and for the maintenance of internal order, a serious indirect liability exists which might involve very large expenditure should difficulties arise.As regards the provision of  300,000 for railways, we are informed that the railway system was constructed at the cost of the Exchequer, and is a British war asset. It is now being valued on a commercial basis with a view to its sale. In the meantime, it is being worked by the Civil Administration, and some expenditure is necessary to provide for rolling-stock and necessary capital works to prevent deterioration. If, as is now hoped, an early sale can be effected, a proportion only of the proposed provision will be required for this purpose.3. Palestine.The expenditure included m the Provisional Estimate was as follows :  Army ... ... ... ...      3,300,000Air Force     ... ... ... ...        162,000Trans-Jordania Grant-in-Aid ... ...        130,000The problem here is the maintenance of internal order in a comparatively small country, and the difficulties which have arisen are due to the attitude of the1913/14 no Vote1921/22 adviced Estimate     ... ...      27,217,0001922/23 Provisional Estimate ... ...      13,003,7001. It is now considered probable that the provision required for 1922/23 will not exceed  10,500,000. This compares with an expenditure of approximately  36,000,000 incurred in 1920/21.    ,The provision in this Estimate results from the acceptance by the British Government of responsibility for the Mandates for Iraq and Palestine, and the policy of establishing a national home for the Jewish Nation in the latter country under the Balfour Declaration of 1917. The Colonial Secretary has given us full explanations of the present position in these countries and the vigorous steps which he has taken to reduce the expenditure consistently with the fulfilment of the obligations undertaken by the Government.2. Iraq.The expenditure included in the Provisional Estimate was as follows:  Army ... ... ... ...      5,700,0000       Army (Arrears and Contingencies)       ...      1,000,000 Air Force     ... ... ... ...      1,900,000Native Levies ... ... ...        300,000Railways      ... ... ... ...        300,000
Arab population towards the Zionist policy adopted by the Government. The Colonial Secretary informed us that, in his opinion, the position is one which requires police rather than troops. The cost of maintaining a British garrison, although reduced from  7,000,000 in 1920 to  3,500,000 in 1921 for about 5,000 troops, would appear to be prohibitive for a small country. The Colonial Secretary now proposes to relieve the War Office of responsibility and to maintain order by means of less expensive Native troops, with a European Gendarmerie and local police. In his view, the cost of these forces may not exceed  2,000,000 in 1922/23, and may be reduced in future years by further economy and the growth of local revenue.4. Arabian Subsidies.A provision of  156,000 is proposed for subsidies to certain Arab Rulers on condition of their maintaining peace and with a view to keeping open access to the Moslem Holy Places. These objects are considered to be essential British interests, and the cost of the subsidies is much less than would be involved by direct British intervention in these regions.CONCLUSIONS.Our conclusions may be summarised as follows: (1.) So long as the existing British responsibilities in the Middle East continue, we cannot suggest any further modification of the arrangements which are being carried into effect by the Colonial Secretary.(2.) On this basis it would appear to be possible to reduce the Estimates for Middle Eastern Services for 1922/23 to approximately  10,500,000, as compared with  13,003,700 in the Provisional Estimates, subject to any further economies which may result from the successful development of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s policy.We desire to add that in the reductions recommended in our First Interim Report on the Army and Air Force Estimates no account was taken of any economies which the Colonial Secretary might be able to effect in Middle Eastern expenditure subsequently to the preparation of the Provisional Estimates.

The number of cases enquired into by the King&apos;s Proctor in 1913/14 was 894, and in 1920/21 2,698, and the number of interventions in 1913/14 was 22, as compared with 141 in 1920/21.The increase is largely due to cases arising out of the War and the increasing complexity of Government business, and, judged from that standpoint, the increase in the Estimates would appear to be justified.There is one point, however, on which we think some economy could be realised, viz., the expenditure on Divorce Interventions by the King&apos;s Proctor. This now amounts to  20,000, as compared with  7,000 before the War. We suggest that a provision of  12,000 for this Service should be sufficient. The Estimate would then stand at  232,528, a saving as compared with the provisional Estimate of  9,129.

The Vote provides for the salaries and travelling and incidental expenses of the Officers of the Lord Chancellor and of the various Departments of the Supreme Court, exclusive of the salaries of the Judges borne on the Consolidated Fund. It also bears war expenditure in respect of Pensions Appeals Tribunals under the War Pensions Act, 1921, estimated to amount to  66,450 in 1922/23.

Besides the receipts and expenditure shown in this Vote, there are extra receipts taken by means of stamps, and further expenditure in connection with the
administration of justice is also borne on other Votes. An annual account is presented to Parliament under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1875, showing the receipts and expenditure in respect of the High Court of Justice, the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Criminal Appeal, which compare as follows for the under-mentioned years : 1913/14. 1920/21.   Receipts      ....... 489,778 596,207Expenditure ... 653,313 949,3814. It is considered, however, that the annexed Account which has been furnished to us for 1920/21 will give a more complete picture of the financial position as regards the administration of justice. On the basis of this Account the total figures for 1920/21 would be as follows :   Receipts        ... ... ... ...       639,094Expenditure   ... ... ... ...    1,002,369We are informed that when the Schedule of Court Fees was originally fixed in 1884 the principle was accepted that the total receipts from fees should be sufficient to cover the total expenses of the Court, excluding the salaries and pensions of the Judges, amounting in 1920/21 to  208,769. It will be seen that the present receipts fall far short of this basis. We recognise that it would not be justifiable to make the cost of justice unduly expensive to the litigant, and we do not consider that the cost of criminal justice ( 58,291 in 1920/21) or of Pensions Appeal Tribunals ( 39,714 in 1920/21) should be charged to fees taken for civil proceedings; but we see no reason why the remaining expenditure should not be met joy fees. We under-stand that some increase of fees was imposed in July 1920, and that a Committee set up by the Lord Chancellor has recently recommended a revised scale, which has been adopted, and is estimated to increase the receipts by about  70,000 a year.We are informed that the organisation and staffing of the various Departments of the Supreme Court have been, or are now being, investigated by a Committee, on which the Treasury is represented. On the recommendation of the Committee, economies amounting to about  30,000 per annum in salaries, excluding bonus, have . been effected, and it is expected that some further reductions may be obtained in the Principal Probate Registry, which is now under investigation. In these circum-stances, and in view of the figures of work given above, we do not make any recommendation on this head.5. Considerable economy might, however, be secured if the District Registrar-ships of all the Divisions of the High Court in one particular district were concen-trated in the hands of the County Court Registrar where that officer is a full time pensionable Civil Servant. The County Court Registrars at present frequently have High Court jurisdiction, with the exception of Probate, but for Probate work a separate Registrar is at present always appointed by the President of the Probate Division, the other appointments being in the hands of the Lord Chancellor.District Probate Registries cost at present nearly  70,000 a year in staff alone, and the Probate Registrars are also in receipt of additional remuneration by way of fees for &quot;agency business.&quot; It is suggested that the posts of District Probate Registrar should be combined with the other Registrarships, in which case a very considerable proportion of these salaries could be saved to the State.6. In view of the need for economy we recommend that further consideration should be given to the omission from Circuit of Towns at which there is little or no business at Assizes. In certain of the towns in question there is no longer a gaol, and persons have to be fetched at considerable expense from the nearest gaol for trial and taken back again. The reduction would also result in a substantial saving of Judges&apos; time and expenses. We understand that the Lord Chancellor fully concurs in the desirability of reform in this direction.[7802]

Work as &quot;Custodian of Enemy Property.&quot;Since 1917, the work of the Public Trustee proper has been conducted at a loss, which has been recouped out of fees in respect of &quot; Custodian of Enemy Property&quot; work, which has shown a substantial surplus.Taking the Public Trustee work alone, we find the following comparative results : 	1921/22	1922/23 (Provisional	Estimate. -	Estimate).-	 	 Expenditure	352.000	364,000 -Receipts from Fees, &amp;c.	282,000	303,000Deficit	70,000	61,000Taking the work as a whole, i.e., including &quot; Custodian of Enemy Property,&quot; it will be seen from the table at the head of this Report that the fees from Enemy Property work, after making good the deficit of  70,000 (in 1921/22) and  61,000 (estimated for 1922/23), on the work of the Public Trustee proper, still provide to the Exchequer surpluses of  99,990 in 1921/22 and  43,845 estimated in 1922/23.Although, hitherto, by means of this recoupment, the Public Trustee work proper has not shown a deficit, we are of opinion that it is an unsatisfactory arrangement which conceals the fact that the Public Trustee work proper is being conducted at a loss, viz., of  70,000 (in 1921/22) and of  61,000 (estimated for 1922/23).If the position in 1922/23 were really going to be as serious as the Provisional Estimate suggests, we should have considered recommending the abolition of the Department, as we deprecate a State subsidy to a Department which renders legal services to private individuals.The position, however, is materially altered by the revised Estimate which the Public Trustee has now furnished.Instead of anticipating a deficit on Public Trustee work proper of  70,000 for 1.921/22, he is of opinion that the deficit will only be  50,000.As regards 1922/23, instead of anticipating a deficit of  61,000. he has informed
us that he is reasonably confident that, in the absence of unforeseen difficulties, he can eliminate the deficit by a reduction of expenditure, provided there is a reasonable intake of new business. At the same time, he is strongly of opinion that any increase of fees would only drive away business and would increase, rather than reduce, the present deficit.CONCLUSION.In these circumstances, we recommend that the plan proposed by the Public Trustee should be given a trial for the year 1922/23 on the understanding that he will effect such reductions of expenditure as will enable him to attain and preserve the equilibrium which he anticipates of expenditure and revenue on his Public Trustee work proper.The result of this recommendation would be that in 1922/23, instead of requiring  61,000 from Enemy Property fees to balance his Public Trustee work expenditure, no such extraneous assistance will be required.The estimated surplus in the whole Department for 1922/23, instead of being only  43,845, as shown in the table at the head of this Report, would thus be increased by  61,000 to a total of  104,845, which sum should, in our opinion, be transferred to the Exchequer and not held in a Suspense Account, which, though convenient, has had the effect of obscuring the fact that this work has resulted in a charge on the Taxpayer.

For many years the Exchequer has borne the cost of Court buildings and the salaries and pensions of the Judges, but these are not included in this Vote. Before the war the remaining expenses of the County Courts were, roughly speaking, balanced by the fees received. It has been explained to us that this state of equilibrium was fortuitous and we have found, in our examination, that the balance has now been altogether upset as the result of the war, and the present position of the County Courts, both as regards finance and. staffing, is felt by the Lord Chancellor to be most unsatisfactory.3. The history of the County Courts during the war shows a progressive decline in remunerate business and, indeed, all the social conditions which obtained during the war, coupled with moratorium and emergency legislation, resulted in a practical cessation of that kind of litigation which used to prove remunerative to the County Courts. This state of affairs is illustrated by the following figures showing, for various years, the revenue received in fees and fines :  1909 ... ... ... ... 511,0001913       -   ... ... ... ... 471,0001914 ... ... ....... 373,0001918 ... ... ... ... 152,000We are informed there are already signs of a revival of litigation in the County Courts, but even so the present fees would fail to meet current expenditure.For the year 1921/22 the income has exceeded estimate and will be  400,000, as against an actual expenditure of  678,000 a deficit of  278,000.In. addition to this unsatisfactory financial position, we are informed that the method and scale of the staffing of the County Courts demands immediate revision if efficiency, which will result in economy, is to be secured.There are only two ways of redressing the balance between the revenue of the Courts and their expenditure. They are : (1) by an increase of fees, and (2) by a reorganisation of the staff.4.  Increase of Fees.We understand that, at the present moment, a Committee appointed by the Lord Chancellor is considering &quot;what additions should, with due regard to the
interest of litigants, be made to the fees charged, whether by increase of the existing fees or by the introduction of new ones &quot; As this matter is at present under con-sideration we limit our remarks on this subject to an expression of hope that the Committee will be able to report very shortly.It has been brought to our notice that no fees are levied in-the County Courts in respect of Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act business previous to the Award.We are informed that the work is arduous and increasing, and adds much to the business of the Courts so much so that the Treasury has been compelled to allow a special series of fees to the Registrars, though unable to obtain anything from the litigants.  The work is therefore a net loss to the Exchequer.However justifiable this provision may have been, we are informed that now, in practically every instance, a workman&apos;s Union takes up his case for him, and the difficulty of obtaining the small sum required to initiate an action is not felt. We doubt, therefore, if there is now any justification for imposing this extra burden on the Taxpayer.The reasons for a change in the system are particularly strong in the present case, where the fees are not sufficient to balance the expenditure of the Courts. We think that the attention of the Committee, which is now considering the fees in County Courts, should be directed to this point, and that, if they so recommend, the necessary powers should be obtained.5. Reorganisation of Staff.As stated above, the remuneration and the conditions of employment of the staffs of the County Courts have been regarded as unsatisfactory for some time past. In 1920, a Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. Rigby Swift, K.C., enquired into the whole matter and made important recommendations about :(a.) Remuneration and status of Registrars, Clerks and Bailiffs; (b.) Closing down certain small Courts; and(c.) Combining or grouping the office of Registrar in a number of Courts.As regards (b) and (c)., we understand that the Lord Chancellor has already taken steps and contemplates further economies in these directions. He has abolished 13 Court Districts, grouped 18 Courts and kept staff vacancies unfilled.As regards the major recommendation of Mr. Rigby Swifts Committee, on the subject of remuneration and status of Registrars, Clerks and Bailiffs, we understand that any reform of this kind will be fully considered as soon as the whole administra-tion of the County Courts and the Finance Staff have been transferred to the Department of the Lord Chancellor. This transfer will, we are told, be effected almost immediately. Without wishing to prejudge the consideration which will thus shortly be given to the remuneration and status of the staffs of the County Courts, we strongty recommend that anything which may be done to give &quot;established&quot; Civil Service status to Registrars and their staffs in the County Courts, with the object of increasing efficiency, should be accompanied by a reduction of the present numbers of staff and an equivalent saving upon the expenditure of the County Courts as a whole.CONCLUSION.We recommend that steps should be taken at the earliest possible moment to restore the financial position and to reorganise the staffing of the County Courts, in view of the great dislocation caused by the war in a system which was, long before the war, archaic and unbusinesslike. It is impossible to recommend any reduction in the Estimate which would be other than a mere guess and might involve the necessity of a Supplementary Estimate. In these circumstances, we recommend that the Lord Chancellor be asked to present, before the end of the year, a Report to be laid before Parliament on the subject of the increase in the scale of fees and the &quot;establishment&quot; of the staff, in order that Parliament may be afforded an opportunity of ascertaining what progress shall then have been made in these directions.

This Provisional Estimate has since been increased to  143,111 an increase of  1,013 owing to a reduction in the anticipated Appropriations-in-Aid.

We are informed that the organisation and salaries of the Procurators Fiscal and Sheriff Clerks and their respective staffs have recently been examined by a Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Blackburn, and as a result of the investigation it is not considered that any reduction of the gross expenditure on these services can be effected.5. It does not appear that any attempt has been made as regards Scotland to carry into effect the principle followed in England, that fees should be levied to defray all the expenses of the Court, excluding the salaries and pensions of the Judges. The estimated total receipts and gross expenditure, including allied services, compare as follows : 1913/14. 1921/22.Total Receipts   ... ... 64,500 86,000Total Gross Expenditure ...       284,532 423,268[7802] E
The estimated expenditure from the Consolidated Fund during the current year for the salaries and pensions of Judges, Sheriffs and Sheriffs Substitute is  123*393, being practically the same amount as in 1913/14.6.. We are informed that a Committee lias been appointed, to consider, amongst other things, whether or to what extent it is possible to meet from the proceeds of fees, the cost of the salaries of the Court of Session and the Accountant of Courfs Office and the Sheriff Courts, excluding the salaries and pensions of the Judges, and to advise as to the increases which should be made.We recommend that steps should be taken at the earliest possible date, as in England, to increase the existing scale of fees to an amount sufficient to cover the expenditure on the same basis as in England,7. In connection with this Vote, our attention has been called to the heavy cost of the Judiciary in Scotland as compared with England. The following statement which has been furnished to us shows the comparative position :  England.

It would appear that, if judicial functions in Scotland could be devolved upon officers similar to the Masters in. the English Supreme Court, a number of Judgeships carrying-salaries of  3,600 per annum, with substantial pension rights, could be replaced by posts costing appreciably less than half this amount.As regards the Provincial Courts, the duties of Sheriffs Substitute comprise generally those of the English County Court Judges, with, the addition of certain Criminal and Probate business. The wider jurisdiction of the Scottish Courts, and the fact that the population is more scattered, may to some extent account for the apparent disproportion of these officers.The Sheriffs Principal receive salaries ranging from  700 to  2,000 per annum, together with 75 per cent, of the Civil Service Bonus. They appear to constitute a first Court of Appeal from the decisions of the Sheriffs Substitute. Their official duties do not occupy their whole time, and they are not restricted from, private-practice. The necessity for these officers appears to us to call for enquiry, but the matter, like the question of the devolution of Judicial business mentioned above, is one which requires expert consideration.We recommend that an independent Committee, comprising members conversant with Scottish Legal procedure, should be appointed to consider the possibility of reforms in Scottish Judicial arrangements on the lines above mentioned, with a view to economy.

The Registry of Deeds staff has increased by 16 per cent, to meet a 16 per cent.increase in the deeds presented and a reduction in the hours of engrossers.3.

Staff Economies.At the same time, we wish to endorse the recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service of 1915, that the Registries of Sasines and of Deeds should be amalgamated under a single Keeper, and that the two vacancies which at present exist for two Assistant Keepers In the Registry of Sasines should not be filled.Further, we understand that the post of Deputy Clerk Register, who is the Head of the Register House, is now vacant. In the past, the Deputy Clerk Register carried out the additional duties of Registrar-General for Scotland. In 1920, however, in view of the Census work, a separate Registrar-General was appointed consequently, the duties of the Deputy Clerk Register are limited to the work of the Register House. In view of this limitation and of the fact that there is now a vacancy, we suggest that a new appointment should not be made, but that the Keeper of the Registry of Sasines and the Registry of Deeds, combined as we have suggested above, should become the Head of the Register House.CONCLUSION.We are of opinion that the staff economies which we have suggested should be effected, with a saving of approximately  4,600. As against this saving of  4,600 there is an increase of  1,612, which, as shown at the outset of the Report, is the amount by which the revised Estimate put forward by the Department exceeds the Provisional Estimate of July last.In addition to the saving on the cost of the Department, the Exchequer would benefit in 1922/23 considerably if the fee revenue were increased.

When the Provisional Estimate for 1922/23 was submitted it was intimated that the staff was in process of re-organisation, and that a further estimate would be submitted. This has now been received, the revised figure being  5,451,000, a reduction of  103,000.The numbers of staff employed compare as under :  August 1, 1914 ... ... ... ...      10.802August 1, 1921 ... ... ... ...      12,525April 1, 1922 (Estimate) ..: ... ...      12.314The increase is mainly in temporary staff.

Headquarters Staff.This accounts for  398,000 in the 1922/23 estimates as compared with  128,150 in 1913/14.   The present staff at Headquarters numbers 1,260.Since the Provisional Estimate was made steps have been taken to enlarge the powers of Collectors and Surveyors in certain matters, thus reducing correspondence and enabling staff at Headquarters to be saved. We think this policy should be pursued so long as the Revenue is not prejudiced.There are large numbers of Returns compiled at Headquarters for other Government Departments, the present reason in some cases not being apparent, it may well be that at the time a Return is originally called for the cost of production is fully justified; but there is grave danger of Returns becoming purely routine, and being continued without any practical result. We consider that the need for the whole of these Returns should be continually under review in relation to present-day cost and usefulness, and we understand that this is being done.We have made enquiries as to the extent to which machines are used in the compilation of statistics. We understand that hitherto practically no machines have been used, but that tests are now being made, and we recommend that the use of machines in connection with the heavy statistical work in this Office should be persevered with, as when introduced elsewhere material economies have resulted.3. Ex-Headquarters Staff.   Customs and Excise Collections. 1913/14 Audited Expenditure ... ...      1,704,9301022/23 Estimate       ... ... ...      4,261,000This staff accounts for the bulk of the vote for Customs and Excise. The total staff has increased from 10,050 in 1914 to 11,146 estimated for April 1922. The increase in numbers does not appear to be unreasonable having regard to the increase in the duties imposed upon these Officers, the amount produced by the Duties having increased four and a half times.We have made enquiries as to the tests which are applied to avoid wastage in staff.Customs and Excise Stations are of two kinds, namely, Time Attendance Stations, and General Stations.
As regards Time Attendance Stations, the Board of Customs and Excise are required by statute, to provide for the attendance of Officers at particular places, e.g., docks and warehouses, for a certain period daily.In General Stations an Officer is given Customs and Excise work of all kinds falling within a defined geographical area. This work comprises surveys, inspections and interviews, accounting, and visits to traders and Old Age Pensioners.The Board have fixed standard time equivalents for all units of work which admit of standardisation, and by this means have arrived at a normal year&apos;s work for each man..4. Revenue Launches, &amp;c.The annual cost of funning and maintaining the Cruiser &quot; Vigilant &quot; is  6,800, to which must be added the cost of running and maintaining the twenty-two Revenue Launches,  48,000, and eighteen Motor Launches at a cost of  7,900 per annum. Having regard to the length of coastline, and. the importance of preventing avoidance of payment of Duties, we cannot recommend any reduction in the preventive work of the Board. The value of this work cannot be gauged by the number of seizures in smuggling cases, as the real value is&apos;the deterrent effect which these craft exercise. The number of seizures has, however, increased. The following table shows the number of seizures, the value of goods seized, and the penalties recovered, in the years 1913/14 and 1920/21.:-			Number of Seizures,	Value of Goods Seized.

INLAND REVENUE.3.

Since the Provisional Estimate for 1922/23 was furnished, it has been found possible to reduce still further the estimated expenditure from  7,269,000 to  7.179,000. This is on the assumption that the cost of the Valuation Office is limited to  350,000. To this  7,179,000, however, it is now sought to add  162,000 for special non-recurrent work in connection, with a reassessment of property to Income Tax (Schedules A and B), and Inhabited House Duty. It is anticipated that this reassessment will increase the receipts from Income Tax, Super-Tax and Inhabited House Duty by roughly  10,000,000.2. The efficiency of this Department is of great importance in maintaining the revenue of the. State and except upon broad general lines it is not possible to criticise its expenditure.The following is a comparison, of the staff : August 1914   ... ... ... ...       4.508April 1922 (Estimated) ... ...      14,840Increase        ... ... ...      10,332 = 229 per cent..These figures exclude Industrial, staff numbering 550 in 1914 and 620 in 1922, and cleaners in the provinces.The Gross Revenue collected by the Department has risen from  87,989,000 in 1913/14 to  512,000,000 in. 1921/22, an increase of 482 per cent. The increase of staff is due not only to the increase in the amount of actual, money which has been collected, but also to : (1.) The increase in the rates of duty which render Taxpayers, in the discussion of their liability, far more jealous of their rights and far more prone than before to engage expert assistance.(2.) The increase in the number of cases which have annually to be dealt with.(3.) The increase in the complexity and elaboration of the. law,(4.) The addition to the work of the Department, of definite new tasks which had no pre-War counterpart, viz., the Excess Profits Duty, the Corporation Profits Tax, and the supervision of the manufacture of currency notes.It should be mentioned, however, that the duties on Land Values were repealed in 1920.It is obvious that the work is affected by the greater complexity of an increased number of cases as well as by the rate of tax, and figures have been supplied by the Commissioners which show that the number of cases has increased from 11.585,000 in 1913/14 to 25,140,000 in 1921/22, the latter figure being inclusive of new Taxes, Excess Profits Duty, and Corporation Profits Tax.
Having regard to the increase in volume and complexity of the work, we make no recommendation.4. Tax Inspectorate.  1913/14 Audited Expenditure ... ...        232,0001922/23 Estimate       ... ... ....    1,201,000The number of Inspectors has increased from 758 to 1,801, and apart from bonus the grading of the Inspectorate has been slightly improved.5.

This increase is entirely attributed to the increase in the work both in volume and com-complexity and to new duties imposed, e.g., Excess Profits Duty, Corporation Tax, &amp;c.We understand that the staff is subject to considerable overstrain and that a large number cannot be considered as fully experienced.The Commissioners of Inland Revenue have adopted a scale based on units of work for comparing the work and staff of the various offices. We have examined returns affecting thirty Tax Districts and find that the number actually employed is 784, which closely approximates to the numbers justified on the basis of units of work which has been adopted.We consider that the Commissioners are closely watching the staff, and we make no recommendation.6.

The same considerations apply to this item as to the two preceding items, and the Commissioners of Inland Revenue are fully satisfied that the increase in the volume of work has been such as to justify the increase in the aggregate remuneration.We understand, however, that if the position of the Collectors and Assessors could be revised on the lines recommended by the Royal Commission on Income Tax and embodied in the Revenue Bill of last year, a progressive economy would be made amounting to  100,000 per annum (exclusive of bonus). We are informed that a change on these lines would result not only in economy, but also in greater efficiency.7. Land Valuation Office. 1913/14 ... ... ... ...      622,5991922/23 ... ... ... ...      446,000Whilst submitting the figure of  446,000, the Commissioners indicate the possibility of rationing to a sum of  350,000, and this latter figure is included in the ,Estimate.The Estimate of  44.6,000 provided for a staff of 395 Permanent Valuers and 476 Clerks, of whom 408 are temporary.  The authorised staff in 1913/14 was 4,824.
The Valuation Office found its origin in a small nucleus staff of Valuers brought together in 1909, its first functions being to value important estates for the purpose of Estate Duty. On the passing of the Finance (1909/10) Act, 1910, the Valuation Office was developed on a large scale to cope with the general valuation of all the land in Great Britain and the assessment and collection of the Laird Value Duties. In addition, the Office was entrusted with valuation and similar work for other Government Departments.The main reason for the setting up of the Office disappeared with the repeal of the provisions of the 1910 Act in 1920. and it appears to us that the curtailment of the State Housing programme and the general reduction of Government activity will cause a further decline in the immediate future in the work of this Office. Great importance is attached by the Commissioners to the value of the Office in connection with Estate Duties, and 50 per cent, of the work is in this connection. It was also pointed out to us that the reassessment of property for Income Tax and Inhabited House Duty will cause additional work to be put upon this Office.In all the circumstances, we cannot recommend the abolition of the Office, although the prime reason for which it was formed has now disappeared; but we think that the reduced figure of  350,000 is the maximum amount which should be allowed for 1922/23, and, further, that no vacancies should be filled until the policy of the Government on the question of the management of Government land and valuation has been determined.CONCLUSION.For reasons given in this Report we have come to the conclusion that the Provisional Estimate of  7,269,000, as reduced by the Department to  7,179,000, should be allowed. This gives a reduction of  90,000, against which, however, must be set an increase of  162,000 for special work in connection with the reassess-ment of property to Income Tax Schedules A and B, and Inhabited House Duty, which reassessment is estimated to increase the receipts from Income Tax, Super-Tax and Inhabited House Duty by roughly  10,000,000 per annum. These alterations involve a net increase of the Provisional Estimate by  72,000.[7802]
POST OFFICE.1. The Estimate for 1922/23, compared with the actual expenditure in 1913/14, and the Estimate for the current year is as follows :  1913/14 Audited Expenditure     ..... .... ....   24,198,7261921/22 Estimate .... .... .... ....   67,165,2871922/23 Estimate (Provisional)  .... .... ....   59,375,376Reduction    .... .... .... ....     7,789,911(equal 11-6 per cent.)Since the Provisional Estimate was submitted a Revised Estimate of  57,371,000 has been put forward, showing a further saving of  2,004,000, which is accounted for by the revision of the Estimate for the conveyance of mails and for the cost of engineering work, and is not attributable to reduction of staff.A detailed comparison of the Provisional Estimate for 1922/23 with the actual Expenditure in 1913/14 and the Estimate for the current year is given in Appendix (A).We have been supplied by the Post Office with an analysis of the Revised Estimate for 1922/23, and the Expenditure can be roughly divided between the three Services as follows: Per Cent, of Total.Postal Services     .... .... .... .... ....      62&quot;3Telegraphs .... .... .... .... ....      13&quot;5Telephones .... .... .... .... ....      24&apos;2The usual Exchequer Account Estimates show only the Cash Revenue and Expenditure. They do not take into consideration services rendered to other Government Departments which are not paid for, Interest on Capital Expenditure, Rental Value of Crown Premises, Sinking Fund Charges, &amp;c. These items are included in the Commercial Accounts, -but estimates of these Accounts are not presented to Parliament.We have been supplied with the following forecast of the Exchequer and Commercial Accounts for 1922/23 compared with the actual Revenue and Expendi-ture in 1913/14, and the estimate figures for the current year: Exchequer Account.	1913/14 Audited Account.		1921/22 Estimate.		1922/23 Revised Estimate.

The volume of Post Office business is governed largely by the trade and industrial situation, and we are informed that the Estimates for 1922/23 are based upon the present traffic, charges and services, and that no allowance has been made for any general revival of trade. A margin has, however, been allowed for the expansion of the telephone system.The Commercial Account Estimate for 1922/23 gives the following results :  Postal        .... .... .... ....      9,110,000 Surplus.Telegraph   .... .... .... ....      2,340,000 deficit.Telephones .... .... .... ....      1,330,000 Surplus.The estimated surplus of  8,100,000 for 1922/23 compares with an estimated deficit for the current year of  3,156,000. In 1920/21 there was a deficit of  6,510,965 and in 1919/20 a deficit of  1,128,065. It would appear, therefore, that on this basis, although considerably increased charges have been imposed, the State has had to subsidise during the past three years, the Postal, Telegraph and Telephone Services by  10,795,000 on the basis of the Commercial Account.That Account is put forward by the Post Office as giving a truer indication of the result of the activities of the Post Office than is contained in the Estimates, but it falls short of the accounts which would be necessary if the whole of the activities of the Post Office were run on a commercial basis. For instance, no balance sheet whatever is prepared for the postal services although this is done in the case of Telegraph and Telephones. A trading Company would, moreover, have to make provision for Income and other Taxes which is not done in any of the accounts.[7802]

Staff.The following table shows the staff employed by the Post Office on the dates specified : ---	*Non-Industrial.	&quot;Industrial.	Total.August 1, 1914	208,889	20,600	229,489August 1, 1921	209,483	24.121	233,604December 1, 1921	204,907	23,613	228,520April 1, 1922 (estimated) ..	202,500	23,500	226,000The figure for 1914 is approximate only. The increase in Industrial staff is said to be due principally to the expansion of the telephone plant to be maintained, and the decrease in Non-Industrial staff to the reduction in business, set-off in part by new services undertaken since the war involving the employment of staff numbering 4,200.* Industrial Staff is largely composed of Engineering Workmen.   Non-industrial Staff includes Clerks, Sorters, Telegraphists, Postmen, &amp;c. -,
4. Clerical Staff.This staff numbers 14,700 and is included, in the non-industrial class. As ii] is engaged largely on routine work it is essential that a regular, systematic survey of the work should be taken in order to see that the output per man-hour is not allowed to drop, and also to ascertain by every possible means whether shorter and more direct methods cannot be adopted for achieving the same result. We have examined the standard tests which are applied to large blocks of routine clerical work and find that checks of this nature are applied to 7,220 out of a total clerical staff of 14,700. Details of the Departments in which these checks are applied are as follows: Money Order Department Accoun1ant-GeneraI&apos;s Department London Telephone Service Savings Bank Department Stores Department District Managers&apos; Offices Accountants&apos; Offices London Engineering DistrictNumber in Departments where no statistical check is possible or for which definite information is not available, e.g,, Secretary&apos;s, Engineer-in-Chiefs, Surveyors&apos;, Provincial Engineers&apos; Offices, &amp;c.Typmg StaffsTotalsApproximate Number of Officers whose &quot;workiB Cheeked by Statistical Methods.Approximate Number whose work 18 not so Chocked.900 940 5001,700 150 100 115 3752,600100 7,480The largest number is employed in the Savings Bank Department, and the tests applied in that Department are of two kinds. In one case a record of output is taken, and this.applies to 1,380 out of a total staff of 4,050. The record shows that the output is appreciably less than before the War; but an improvement is shown as compared with 1918-19, when the staff wTas necessarily less efficient than normal. It is also explained to us that the work has grown in complexity as well as volume.In the second case, a definite task, based on tests, is allotted as being a fair day&apos;s output, and the staff have to perform that task. A similar check is applied in the Accountant-General&apos;s Department.Postal Services.These services, which in the Revised Estimate are shown as costing  35,804,270, represent 62&apos;3 per cent, of the total cost of the Department. The staff may be divided into two main sections Indoor Force and Outdoor Force.5. Indoor Force.We find on enquiry that a system is in existence which enables the different classes of work, such as letters, parcels, sealed bags, registered letters, &amp;c, to be valued out in units so as to arrive at the staff considered necessary under normal conditions for dealing, with the work of the office. It appears that this system is not regularly applied either at headquarters or in the seventeen Surveyors&apos; areas into which the country is divided, the surveyors relying on personal inspection by their staff. It is, however, used in cases where Postmasters apply for increases of staff. Before the War, we understand, cases of declining traffic were practically unknown, and at that time it may be that the limited use provided all the check that could reasonably be expected. Since the War, however, the position has changed, and we think that with so appreciable a reduction in traffic since 1913/14-e.g., letters show a. drop 77,000,000, postcards 426,000,000, postal orders 58,000,000 a general scrutiny of the staff in relation to the volume of work is absolutely necessary.We fully recognise that unless great care is exercised, comparison of one office with another or one district with another may be dangerous and misleading. We think, however, that a full comparison of the volume of work in relation to the staff and cost for each of the seventeen Surveyors&apos; Districts would be valuable.
Each Surveyor would know how his results compared with those of earlier years and also how far they differed from the results obtained in other districts, and could ascertain the causes of this divergence. It is obviously impossible with varied conditions as to districts, train services, rush hours, &amp;c, to lay down a hard and fast standard; but returns of the nature indicated serve to show how far each district deviates from the normal. At present the Administrative Machine is designed to check growth of staff, but does not necessarily operate in times of falling traffics.The Department have evidently realised the importance of a scrutiny of this kind, because some six mouths ago a Travelling Committee was appointed to inspect the larger Post Offices in Great Britain. This Committee has compiled certain figures of traffic and staff for fifteen of these offices, but has not yet submitted a report to the Postmaster-General. Discussions, however, are taking place between the Committee and the various Postmasters. It is obvious from the figures compiled by this Committee that there is a primd facie case for enquiry, and the Committee itself is by no means satisfied with the standard of staffing which obtains at some of the offices. We think it desirable that the scope of this enquiry should be extended and the report expedited.In order to gather a general impression as to the present relation between traffic and staff, the Post Office have compiled at our request a comparison between October 1921 and the last occasion when a test was taken. We selected for this test the North Midland and Scotland East districts, also two large offices  Birmingham and Nottingham. The dates of the figures with which comparison is made vary widely; in some cases the last test made was in 1905.The returns relate to both indoor and outdoor forces, but at this stage we will deal only with the figures as to indoor staff.The Post Office point out that the returns have had to be compiled under considerable pressure, and that since the date of the earlier figures changes have occurred in the conditions of service, notably the granting of half-an-hour meal relief in the case of split duty. Nevertheless, the results, even when looked at in districts, reveal such divergence as to be of interest.	Increase or Decrease, per cent.			Units of Work.	Staff Engaged.

For example, Ashbourne has a drop in business of 3*96 per cent., but an increase in staff of 24&apos;62 per cent., and in cost of 33&quot;28 per cent. Stamford has a drop in business of 7&quot;26 per cent., but an increase in staff of 16&quot;6 per cent., and in cost of 8&quot;9 per cent.The result of our own partial and necessarily general investigation, coupled with the results of the Committee appointed by the Post Office, leads us to point out the vital necessity for a strict watch on the cost of the service. It should not be necessary to have to go back fourteen years to obtain a comparison for an office of the standing and importance of Nottingham.During the course of our investigation we have been struck with the immobility of the Postal staff. For example at Derby the existing permanent staff is admittedly greater than present conditions would justify, but being permanent men they are carried as surplus. At the same time temporary staff are being employed at Manchester. Again at Stornoway, to meet an anticipated develop-ment of traffic a considerable addition had been made to the strength of the
office; the anticipations have not been realised, but the additional staff is still detained. In the former case it may well be that the normal vacancies will soon absorb the surplus staff, and that no economy would result from moving men for a short time, but it would appear that considerable time must elapse before surplus at an office like Stornoway can be profitably employed. We also found that in all cases, except the smaller branch offices, men for leave relief duty have been appointed. We consider that the question of fluidity of the staff is one wdiich should be very carefully reviewed.The total indoor staff involved is 27,500. We realise that in small offices a minimum number of staff must be in attendance, but, after allowing for that, and having regard to the results in the districts examined we think that with present traffics a closer and more regular scrutiny of the staffing would admit of a reduction of staff equivalent to 5 per cent, being effected.This reduction would take some time to bring about so we only suggest a saving in 1922/23 of  150,000.0. Outdoor Force.In the case of outdoor staff many considerations are involved. A minimum service has to be given, and the delivery of letters completed at a reasonable time. The practice of the Post Office seems to be to deal with complaints either from the public or the staff by means of a personal test of the round by an inspector attached to the office or by a surveying officer.As in the case of indoor staff, a measure of traffic can be applied to town postmen.   Obviously rural postmen are governed by different circumstances.An examination of the figures of work and staff for the same districts, as in the case of indoor staff, shows the following results : -Increase or Decrease, per cent.Units of Work.Birmingham   ..NottinghamNorth Midland districtEast Scotland districtTotal4- 22-8&quot;)-\- 1-65-I- 15-114- 10-214- 14-74Staff Engaged.4 14-7- 3-74 11-614 2-68-I-   8-33Cost.4 21-814- 1-3-I- 20-394- 3-514 14-07The figures shown&apos; above are not unsatisfactory, but when the figures of individual offices comprised in the districts are considered, aprimd facie case for enquiry is indicated : 	Increase or Decrease, per cent.

Here again time would be required to bring about a reduction so we suggest a saving in 1922/23 of only  200,000.
7. Telegraphs.In this Department quality of service and economy of operation have to be kept equally in mind.We have made enquiry as to how the checks&apos;of the Department are exercised, and find that returns are furnished to headquarters for one day per month by the smaller offices and one day in alternate months by the largest offices. By this means a check on the quality of the service is maintained.A periodical check on staffing is also maintained by headquarters, and the following Table shows for the last five half-years how the staff and traffic have varied at the ninety-seven largest offices: Date.	Staff Hours.				Total Traffic (Valued).	Average Hourly Number of Telegrams dealt with per Officer-(a.) By  the   Manipu-lative Staff; (J.) By the Total 8taff.		Supervising Force.

The Post Office regard an output of 24 telegrams per hour per operator employed on manipulative duties as reasonable for an average office, and it will be seen that the average in October 1921 was only 19&apos;4 per hour, a reduction of 3&quot;6 per hour compared with the previous test, and 4*6 below standard. Similarly, although here the figure is a little more difficult to compile, 14 telegrams per hour is regarded as the average over-all output for all staff, and this figure was actually reached in October 1919 and April 1920. At the last test, however, the output was only 12&apos;10.These figures show, we think, that while there has been a steady decrease in the force employed, this decrease has lagged behind the fall in traffic. It is admitted that there is an estimated surplus of telegraph staff of about 15 per cent, over bare necessities. Telegraph traffic, however, is not regular, and we append a diagram, Appendix (B), showing the fluctuations in the average daily number of telegrams handed in throughout the United Kingdom during the last three years. We recognise that in the case of a sudden increase in traffic the staff cannot be immediately augmented by trained personnel, as it is some time before an operator can give a reasonable rate of output. Some reserve of force is therefore necessary; but we find it difficult to justify the retention of 15 per cent, surplus staff, especially as there is a staff of about 11&apos;1 per cent, carried as a relief force to cover sick and holiday absences. Further, holidays are given during the period of maximum traffic.The present rate of wastage is about 7f per cent, per annum, and this has been allowed in the Estimates for next year. We think unless there is an increase in traffic, the rate of wastage might be slightly accelerated during next year and a saving of a further  30,000 a year effected. &apos;In reviewing the telegraph service we have been impressed by the full information regularly compiled as to the volume of traffic, the staff employed, and the efficiency of the service.8. Telephones.As in the case of telegraphs, quality of service and economy in operation are equally important.A check on the traffic and staff is maintained by means of a return for one day in each quarter in the case of the larger Exchanges, and for one day in six months for the smaller Exchanges. We have examined the individual returns and also the summary and are satisfied that the figures produced enable a very complete check to be kept on the efficiency of the various Exchanges, and we are told that the operator is not aware when the check is being taken.
From the beginning of 1921 the traffic rapidly decreased, and the decrease was accentuated by the introduction of new rates in April 1921. By May 1921, when the steps taken after the Armistice to strengthen the telephone staff had produced the maximum trained staff, the busy hour load of originating traffic per operator had fallen to about 155 &quot;valued&quot; calls. The standard busy hour load recognised by the Post Office as efficient is 200.It was estimated by the Post Office that at May 1921 there was a theoretical surplus of 16*9 per cent, of the staff at Exchanges of 300 lines or more. Recruiting was suspended, and while the staff has been reduced the number of lines has increased, which has resulted in a reduction in the theoretical surplus.Appendices (C) and (D) give a summary of the lines, traffic, staff and service of these Exchanges from November 1918 to January 1922, -with notes which may be of interest.In this case also we have been favourably impressed with the information regularly compiled with a view to securing economy of operation and efficiency of service.Of the 15,800 operators, 13,300 are employed at the larger Offices, and we think that, failing a&apos; growth in traffic, recruiting should remain suspended, retirement accelerated, if possible, and an additional saving of . 10,000 realised next year.9. Engineering.The programme of engineering work for which provision is made in the Revised Estimates is as follows: 	Lines and Apparatus.		Electric Light and Power and Common Services.	Telegraph Services.	Telephone Services.	Construction.. Renewals, rearrangements, &amp;c. Maintenance Repairs of stores in Post Office factories..	  703,140 200,800 420,000 32,060	  2,085,030 3,029,700 288,570	  68,690 57,750 227,000 4,700	1,356,000	5,403,300	358,140Total	 7,117,440		In 1913/14 the corresponding figure was  2,700,000.In addition to the above estimates there is considerable new construction of telephone line and equipment on capital account estimated to cost during 1922/23, including sites and buildings,  9,500,000, so that the total estimated expenditure on new construction and maintenance in connection with the telegraphs and telephones of the country during 1922/23 is  16,617,440.The first cost of telegraph plant at 31st March, 1922, is stated to be  10,000,000, and of the telephone plant,  52,250,000. We have examined in detail the expenditure for eleven years and do not think the provision proposed for maintenance and renewal can be reduced if the efficiency of the service is to be maintained.&apos; With regard to Capital Expenditure on Telephone Account, we understand that upwards of 23,000 applicants are waiting telephonic facilities, and having regard to the fact that this country lags behind other countries in the ratio of telephones to population we do not think this expenditure can with advantage be reduced.For purposes of engineering control the country is divided into thirteen areas, each area being under the control of a Superintending Engineer who is responsible direct to the Engineer-in-Chief.We h ave examined very carefully the various methods which are employed to secure a satisfactory output of work from each workman. The total time occupied by the workmen on maintenance is divided by the number of units maintained and the average cost of maintenance per unit per week is arrived at. By this means the Engineer-in-Chief keeps in close touch with the cost of maintenance in T7802] - G
each of his districts, and is able to compare the results obtained in the various districts.In regard to construction work progress reports are compiled which enable the Engineer-in-Chief and the Superintending Engineers to ascertain the cost under each item of work.We find that the results for the various districts are circulated to all Super-intending Engineers, so that a laudable spirit of rivalry is encouraged.In this department there is a systematic compilation of results and circulation of information.10. Imperial Wireless Chain.Included in the Post Office Estimates for next year is an item of  250,000 for plant, &amp;c, in connection with the Imperial Wireless Chain, and the Office of Works have been asked to include  200,000 for buildings. The total estimated cost to this country of its proportion of the Imperial Wireless Chain is  800,000, so that a balance will remain to be provided in stibsequent years. We understand that schemes have been put forward by a commercial company, but that they have been subjected to criticism both on general and technical grounds, and that the present scheme has the approval of the experts. Certain work, such as the first links at Leafield (Oxfordshire) ancL Cairo, have been authorised, and officers have been sent out to South Africa, India and the East to select sites. Much of the preliminary work has been completed. In these circumstances, we make no recommendation.11. Engineering Stores.We have investigated the position of stores and find that the value of stock at the 31st March, 1921, was  3,126,591. The stock at the 31st March, 1914, valued at 1921 prices represented  2,906,000. Having regard to the fact that included in the stores in 1921 there is a submarine cable valued at  318,000, it does not appear that there has been any undue increase in the value of stores held.The total stock of stores includes items which must be held in. case of emergencies, such as storms, special events, and so forth, and these amount to  1,483,000, leaving a balance of  1,642,791 available for the maintenance of all engineering plant (telegraphs, telephones and common services), for joining up additional telephone subscribers, for works of renewal and rearrangement, and for new construction works both on Yote account and Capital Account. This stock represents between four and five months&apos; average consumption, and having regard to the great variety of the stores and the time required to obtain tenders and deliveries we do not think the stock held is excessive.12. Factories.The Post Office operate two Factories, one in London and one in Birmingham, the total number of workpeople employed being 579 and 540 respectively.The bulk of the work at these Factories consists of the repair of telephone and telegraph apparatus, and the adaptation and conversion of apparatus from older to later forms.The work is of a very varied character; but it appears from information which has been supplied to us that it has been found possible to apply piece-work rates to over 80 per cent, of the total work of the Factories. The large preponderance of piece-work enables the foreman to give special attention to time-work jobs : but in any case of a job becoming a recurrent one a piece-work price is fixed. We understand that it is the policy of the Post Office that if a piece-work rate is once fixed it is not cut unless a change of method is introduced, and the workmen are encouraged to earn as large profits as possible with a view to reducing estab-lishment charges.It is not practicable for us to form any opinion as to the cost of repairs carried out at these Factories; but in reply to an enquiry we were informed that in all cases where outside tenders have been obtained the prices submitted have been found to be in excess of Factory costs after clue provision had been made for establishment charges.13. Conveyance of Mails.Conveyance by rail, road, sea and air is put at  8,662,900 in the Provisional
Estimate for 19&apos;2&apos;2/23, as compared with  2,845,336 in 1913/14. The Provisional Estimate has since been reduced to  7,187,472.Apart from Road Transport owned by the Government these payments depend on Contracts and other arrangements made with the carrying companies; and we are not in a position to make any recommendation.We understand, however, that an. arrangement has been made with the railway companies to carry the Parcels Post packages on the basis of 40 per cent, of gross receipts in lieu of .55 per cent., but this saving has been taken into account in the Revised Estimates.14. Motor Transport.The Post Office own the following vehicles: --	Eng-ineering&apos; Department.	Stores Department.	Postal Services.	Total.Motor-Cycle Combinations..	500		7	507Motor-Cars	12	t t		12Motor Vans and Lorries  ..	165	35	151	351We have examined the checks employed on the running of these vehicles, and find that adequate allowance is made for depreciation, interest on capital and other overhead charges. The introduction of these vehicles has effected substantial economies, and we find that every care is taken before new Services are under-taken to ensure that in each case the running of Government-owned vehicles is cheaper than hiring.15. Uniform.The total cost of Uniform, including  16,500 for cost of uniform purchased for other Government Departments, is, on the 1913/14 standard of quality and equipment,  488,000. As In the case of the Fighting Services and Police, we consider that a lowering of the standard can be adopted without loss of efficiency. Economies have already been made amounting to  90,500, but we think more can be done in that direction, so that the total saving may be equivalent to 33^ of present-day cost based on the pre-war standard of uniform. This would yield a further saving on the Estimate of  81,000.16. Postal Charges.The Exchequer Account Estimates for 1922/23 foreshadow a surplus on tlie three Services as a whole of  5,140,000.It has been shown, however, that in the current financial year the Services have been subsidised by the State, and it is for consideration what proportion of this surplus should go to the reduction of postal charges and to the Exchequer.We have been reminded by the Postmaster-General of the pledges given when the new rates were imposed in 1921 &quot; that the Government recognise that when costs are reduced the user of the Postal Services is entitled to get the benefit, and that such reductions as are possible in the rates now imposed will be made as soon as a surplus on the Post Office balance sheet is assured.&quot;This pledge was given in relation to specific increases, and we understand that the increases imposed at that date may be estimated to yield at the rate of  2,000,000 per annum.In the present financial condition of the country we do not think it unreasonable that a great monopoly like the Postal Telegraph and Telephone Services should yield some return to the Exchequer in respect of the capital invested, especially having regard to the fact that if it were in the hands of Trading Companies the Government would receive substantial payments in respect of Income Tax, Corporation Tax and Property Tax.It may be that in certain cases additional net revenue could be derived from a reduction in charges and to such reduction no exception can be taken. We consider, however, that economy of operation is so important that any reductions in charges should where practicable be coupled with conditions which would enable the Post Office to take fuller advantage of the hours when surplus staff is neces-sarily available and thus relieve the congestion and expense of the rush hours.-[7802] G 2
CONCLUSION.As a result of our consideration, we are of opinion: 1. That regular and systematic check of traffic and staff should be instituted for the Postal Services.2. That the cost of indoor force can be reduced to the extent of  150,000.3. That the cost of outdoor force can be reduced to the extent of  200,000.4. That the cost of the Telegraph and Telephone staffs can be reduced by  40,000.5. That the standard of uniform should be lowered, as recommended in the case of other Uniform Services.6. That the Provisional Estimate of  59,375,376 should be reduced to  56,900,145, a saving of  2,475,231 in 1922/23, which is  471,000 less than the revised Estimates submitted.APPENDIX (A).Comparison of the Expenditure (1913/14), Estimates (1921/22) and Provisional Estimates (1922/23) of the Post Office.

The table above shows that the maximum number of originating and incoming calls was reached in November 1920 with a total for the day of 7,270,786 calls. At that time the average day load per operator was 678, but in July 1921 it had dropped to 528, and is now only 570. The figure of 678 in November 1920 is considerably inferior to the average day load, 729, in October 1919 ; but a reference to the diagram, Appendix (D), shows that in the year 1919 the average time taken to answer calls was, comparatively speaking, very high, and the percentage of calls answered by a telephonist in 10 seconds or less was correspondingly low. At the present time an improved quality of service is given, and the average time taken to answer calLs is now 5-^ seconds, the percentage of calls answered in 10 seconds or less being about 90 per cent.

We are informed that this is due to a decrease in the volume of private business and to an increase in the amount of the Pension List which is a first charge on fees. As stated above, the Select Committee on the House of Lords Offices propose an increase of 30 per cent, in Judicial fees and a slight increase in fees for Private Bills, but in view of the great decrease in the fee revenue since 1914 and the present, increased costs, we suggest that the Select Committee should give the fullest consideration to the possibility of :  1. Increasing up to 50 per cent, the scale of Judicial fees. -2. Increasing the present fees for Private Bills by 50 per cent.As regards Judicial fees, we are informed that 50 per cent, is roughly the increase recently imposed in the case Of High Court fees.

We understand that the Authorities in the House of Commons have considered the possibility of a reduction, but are of opinion that it is not possible to reduce the number of Police on duty in the House of Commons. As this is a matter which necessarily depends on changing political circumstances, we assume that the Authorities will&quot; keep the matter constantly under review.Fee Revenue.The figures at the head of this Eeport give a comparison of the net expenditure of the House of Commons.

This decrease is due to a diminution in the number of Private Bills. We understand that the Authorities in the House of Commons propose a slight increase in fees, but, as in the case of the House of Lords, we suggest that they should give full consideration to the possibility of increasing fees for Private Bills by 50 per cent.We understand that the Provisional Estimate for 1922/23 includes the salaries of Members of Parliament representing constituencies in Southern Ireland, and if, as we assume, these Members do not sit at Westminster, we are informed that the Provisional Net Estimate can be reduced by  28,400. This reduction, in addition to the saving of  3,979 already made on the Provisional Estimate of July last, gives a total saving of  32,379.

Cabinet Secretariat.2. Committee of Imperial Defence.3. War History Section.Of these, the Cabinet Secretariat, which constitutes the major part of the Office, how performs secretarial duties for the Cabinet itself, for Committees of the Cabinet and for various Conferences, international and otherwise, in which the Cabinet is chiefly concerned. It also has certain duties in connection with the League of Nations.The following table shows the comparative numbers of staff of the whole Cabinet Office :-August 1. 1021.

In these circumstances we make no recommendation. There will be a saving of  1,342 clue to the reduction made since the Provisional Estimate of July last.[7802]* Provision made under Cabinet Secretariat.H

Permanent      ... 217 367 531(6.) Temporary   m ... 53 350 190270 717 7211. Treasury.The staff of the Treasury for the year 1921/22 number 381 as compared with 148 in 1914. The figure of 381, however, includes 8 Ministers, 8 Accountants for the Public Service &quot; (who are on&apos;the Treasury Vote merely as a matter of convenience), 13 Treasury officials seconded for other service and 104 messengers and charwomen, whose duties extend over the Treasury Office, the official residences in Downing Street and the offices of the Chief Whips and Parliamentary Counsel.The number of Treasury officials engaged on Treasury work proper is thus 248. Of this number, there are 92 Higher Division Officials to exercise the whole of the Departmental functions comprised in the term &quot; Treasury Control.&apos;5 This number if 92 compares with 37 in 1913/14. The addition of approximately 148 per cent, to the pre-war strength of the Higher Division staff of the Treasury is due to the great increase in volume and complexity of the financial and administrative business, a fact which is illustrated by the comparative figures of the Budget which, in 1914/15, was  207 millions and in 1921/22 is  1,216 millions. Similarly, the Debt which, in 1914/15, was  706 millions, in 1921/22 is  7,633 millions.We are satisfied that the Treasury staff is under constant review and it is estimated that in April 1922 the number of Higher Division staff engaged on Departmental work will have decreased from 92 to 81. In considering the staff of the Treasury, we have borne in mind that it is constantly and rightly looked upon as the source from which officials with special experience may be drawn to undertake special work outside the Treasury, as occasion demands. In so comparatively small an Office, this is an important consideration and we find that, at the present time, 13 officers, of whom 11 are Higher Division staff, are seconded for such special service.In these circumstances, we make no recommendation, as we are of opinion that nothing should be done to detract from the efficiency of the Treasury machine for controlling expenditure and effecting economies.2. Paymaster-General&apos;s Office.The following table gives a comparison of the numbers of the staff: August 1, August 1, April 1,1914. 1921. 1922.(a.) Permanent      ...           56 47 205(&amp;.) Temporary      ...             9 212 6465 259 269The functions of the Paymaster-General are of the same nature as before the war, but the amount of the work has very greatly increased.  The Paymaster-General
either pays or imprests to other officers for payment all moneys for public service which are not provided in the Votes for Revenue Departments or issued for National Debt.  The increased staff is due to the following factors:  (1.) Payment of disability pensions awarded by the Ministry of Pensions to Officers, Warrant Officers, Nurses and their dependents. This work, which is entirely neAv, occupies some 40 per cent, of the staff, but it is gradually declining.(2.) An increase of 30 per cent, in the number of Navy, Army and Air Force &quot;Service Pensions.&apos;&apos;- There are at present almost 22,000 of these pensions.(3.) An increase in the number of Civil Effective Payments (i.e., separateindividual payments) from 377,000 in 1913/14 to 1,436,000 in 1920/21. (4.) An increase in the income tax assessment work.We realise that the work performed is very heavy at the present time, but it is of a kind which will decline as the numbers of the Civil Service as a whole are reduced and as the awards of the Ministry of Pensions decrease, and we think that the numbers of the staff should be kept constantly under review.The remaining sub-Departments do not appear to us to call for special comment, but we are informed that under the settlement with the Irish Free State the cost of the Paymaster-General (Ireland), estimated at  6,042, and the Teachers&apos; Pension Office (Ireland), estimated at  2,908 may be removed from this Vote, but as this is still uncertain we do not include it as a reduction.As stated at the outset of this Report, there will be an increase of  10,069 over the Provisional Net Estimate of July last.[7802]

Alien Immigration Control.The cost of this service has increased since 1914 from  12,000 to approximately  100,000 in the current year. The estimated&apos; cost for 1922/23 is  74,000. This control, which is designed to exclude alien immigrants who are destitute, diseased or otherwise undesirable, is a matter of policy. If it were abolished, the saving of expense is obvious. As regards the results which it achieves, we find that during the twelve months ending the 31st December last, 294,569 alien passengers landed at British Ports, and 1,712 were refused permission to land. Of these, 200 were refused on medical grounds. If it were decided that the cost of this control should be met by a Poll Tax on alien passengers say, 5s. the revenue therefrom would, on the experience of the last twelve months, be some.  73,000 per annum, but in considering this matter, the following classification, which shows the nature and business of the alien passengers who landed last year, is of importance. They are classified as follows : Residents returning from abroad ... ...       60,252Passengers in transit to other countries    ...       28,947 Visitors on holiday       ... ... ...      107,310Visitors on business      ... ... ...       66,789Foreign Diplomatic and other Missions    ... 6,584Seamen ... ... ... ...       13,752Other passengers ... ... ...        10,395With regard to visitors &quot;on business,&quot; it must be remembered that there is a considerable number who make regular journeys to and from this country sometimes twice a week.Apart from the political and economic considerations which are involved, we would point out that there are practical difficulties in the way of the imposition of such a Poll Tax.   The large majority of these alien passengers come by the cross-
Channel service, using a through Railway ticket which, of course, gives no particulars about the passenger. We understand that there is no such difficulty in connection with the Tax which is imposed by the United States of America on alien immigrants. In the latter case, the Steamship Companies are in possession of full particulars about the passengers whom they book to America, and with ,the aid of that informa-tion, the Companies are able to add the Tax to the price of the ticket.Apart from these remarks, we make no recommendation on what is essentially a question of policy.3. Anthrax Disinfecting Station.Under the Anthrax Prevention Act of 1919 a factory has been established at Liverpool for the purpose of disinfecting certain classes of wool, and sums amounting to  35,000 are provided in the Estimates of 1921/22 and 1922/23 to cover working expenses.Fees are charged for this disinfection, but at the present time only two classes of wool are on the schedule for compulsory disinfection, mid the depression in the wool trade and the fall in the price of wool have caused supplies to the Station to fall off very considerably, even though the fees have been temporarily reduced.The Station was opened early in 1921, and it is estimated that the financial year 1921 /22 will show a deficit on working expenses of  5,705. This includes no provision for interest and depreciation on the capital cost of the building and plant, which cost  113,000.We understand that the Home Secretary has recently considered the future of . this Station and is of the opinion that nothing should be done to extend its scope or plant in the present circumstances, as had been suggested, since this would probably result in a further deficit. He does, however, attach considerable importance to the experimental work which is being done and which it is desirable to bring to a degree of success which will induce other nations to adopt similar methods of disinfection. The results of the experiment are, in fact, being awaited by Foreign Countries, and if successful, it is hoped to obtain an International Agreement on the subject. The Home Secretary is therefore in favour of the Station being kept running on its present basis for a limited period, so that the experiment may proceed and the future course of the wool trade may be gauged more accurately than is possible at present.In these circumstances, we recommend that the Station should operate for the present, but that its position should be reviewed in four months&apos; time, in order that it may either be closed altogether at the end of six months from now, or continue provided, in the latter case, that its fee revenue is sufficient to cover all expenses and capital charges, or that the full cost is met by a subsidy from the trade in the interest of whom, and its workers, the Station was established.In considering this Vote, we find that a certain amount of administration cost at Headquarters is incurred in supervising the affairs of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, and we suggest that the present is an appropriate time for the Government to consider the relation of these dependencies to the Exchequer.4. Isle of Man.This Island enjoys in full the protection of the Forces of the Crown, and its inhabitants possess all the advantages of subjects of the United Kingdom as regards diplomatic and consular privileges abroad. The present position is that the Island makes a statutory annual contribution of  10,000 to the Imperial Exchequer, but, in addition to this, Tynwald (the Legislature of the Isle of Man) has, in the present year, voted an additional special war contribution of  20,000 for a limited period of years, representing payment by annual instalments of a war contribution of  250,000. Before the war, the total revenue of the Island was about  85,000. In 1920/21, it rose to  369,000, and in the present financial year it is estimated to be  321,000. In addition to this revenue, there is the Isle of Man Accumulated Fund, representing the invested surplus of revenue over expenditure for more than fifty years, and the realised surplus each year of revenue over expenditure. This Fund is estimated to stand at the 31st March, 1922, at  333,000, the net amount of the Fund at that date being estimated at  273,000.Until 1918, revenue was derived entirely from indirect taxation, but since then, there has been an Income Tax at rates varying from 1M. in the   for incomes under  500 to Is. &amp;%d. for incomes over  1,500. This Income Tax, however, produces less than one-fifth of the total revenue.  From the foregoing, it will be seen that, whereas
f.4the total revenue of the Island has increased from  85,000 to  321,000, or roughly, four-fold, the statutory annual contribution to the Imperial Exchequer is still only  10,000, though this has been supplemented by the special war contribution voted by Tynwald.We suggest that, in the present circumstances, the Government might think it an appropriate occasion to consider,a revision of the amount of annual contribution, and the disposal of part at least of the Accumulated Fund, which, as we have already shown, is estimated to stand at a net amount of  273,000 on the 31st March, 1922. In this connection, we would acid that Lord MacDonnell&apos;s Committee in 1911 reported that, in their &quot;opinion, the balance, which at that time amounted to  78,000,&apos; was unnecessarily high.5. Channel Islands.These Islands make no annual contribution to Imperial revenue, though, like the Isle of Man, they obtain practically the same benefits as though they were part of the United Kingdom. Guernsey and Jersey, however, have each made contributions of  100,000 to the expenses of the war. Though not in any way depreciating the value of these special contributions, as in the case of the Isle of Man, we think that the position calls for review. The Channel Islands require and raise comparatively little rever/ue, and are very lightly taxed. In Guernsey there is now an Income Tax of 7d. in the  . In Jersey, there is at present no Income Tax, and in both Islands the bulk of the revenue is raised by indirect taxation. We suggest that, as in the case of the Isle of Man, the Government might think the present an appropriate occasion on which to consider whether the Channel Islands should not be invited to make an annual contribution for the purpose of relieving the Imperial Exchequer in return for the benefits which the inhabitants obtain.In this latter connection, we would point out that the cost to Army Votes of troops stationed in the Channel Islands shows the following comparison :  1  Before the War-  (i.) For the Regular Garrison ... ... 135,000(ii.) For the Militia       .. ... ... 25,0002. At the present time (i.) For the Regular Garrison ... ... 330,000(ii.) For the Militia      ... ... ... 35,000CONCLUSION.The suggestions we have made do not enable us to point to a reduction of this Estimate at the present time, but there will, of course, be a saving of  36,514, the amount by which the revised Estimate falls short of the Provisional Net Estimate of July last.

There is practically no change in the staff of the Privy Council Offices as compared with 1914, though there has been an increase of work owing to the number of Orders in Council which required to be issued under recent legislation, and to the fact that, since 1915, the Judicial Committee has been empowered to sit in two Divisions.Revenue from Fees.The figures given at the head of this Report show a comparison of the net expenditure.

Consequently, the incidental expenses of manufacture have shown a very great increase.

For the purpose of reviewing the work of the establishment as a whole, we recommend that the total output, as represented by good coin, should be converted into common units by applying conversion factors to the number of coins of each denomination, regard being had to the fact that in the case of a portion of the output the whole of the operations are not carried out in the Royal Mint, as a quantity of bars of metal and &quot;blanks&quot; are obtained from outside works. This would enable the output of good coin during the four-weekly periods to be compared with the man-hours in the same form as that suggested for individual shops, and in addition the total wages paid out and cost of wages per units should be given.The conversion factors to be applied to the numbers of coins of the various denominations should be on the basis of the cost of labour. This would necessitate a careful costing analysis for one or more periods, but, when once obtained, the amount of clerical labour involved in compiling the return would be very small.[7802]I

Cost of Board.Of the Estimate for 1921/22, salaries, wages and allowances amount to  2,444, and travelling and incidental expenses to  80. If to this were added the cost of Allied Services, which are charged to other Votes in respect of accommodation, fuel and light, rates, stationery, printing and postage, the total cost for the current year the Board consists of a Chairman and two members. Of these, the Chairman and one member are unpaid, and the other member receives a fee of 5 guineas per meeting, up to a maximum of  525 per annum. The Secretary is an official of the Ministry of Health, and receives a special allowance of  200 per annum in respect of his duties with the Board. In addition, there are three clerks, two typists and two messengers.2. Origin, and Functions of the Board.The Board was set up in February 1917 &quot; to deal, by way of conciliation and arbitration, with questions arising with regard to claims for increased remuneration made by classes of employees in Government Departments other than classes of employees who are engaged wholly or mainly by way of manual labour of a kind common to Government and other employment.&quot; At present the Board is not empowered to entertain applications for permanent increases of salary from classes of officers with salaries of  500 or over, or placed on scales of salary rising to  500 and over.It is open to either party to a dispute to go to the Board independently of the consent of the other, i.e., arbitration is compulsory if either party desires it. It was set up at a time when war conditions had dislocated the Civil Service, and when there was no established machinery of conciliation and arbitration, but it has now passed from the position of being a war-time expedient and has come to be regarded as a permanent body.Whatever justification there may have been in time of war for setting up such a body, whose awards are final and who can thus authorise expenditure without the authority of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, we are very strongly of opinion that the main justification for the existence of the Board has disappeared with the institution of the Whitley Councils in the Civil Service. It has now become the established practice in the Civil Service to consider on these Whitley Councils questions of remuneration, so far as they relate to posts carrying salaries not exceeding  500 per annum, and, in these circumstances, we are of opinion that the need for a standing Arbitration Board no longer exists.We therefore suggest that the Board and, with it, compulsory arbitration, should be abolished. If this suggestion is adopted, the saving in 1922/23 will be  1,886, and there will be consequential savings on other Votes in respect of overhead charges.is  3,909.CONCLUSION.

Permanent        ... 50 55 63(b.) Temporary        ... 5 8 255 63 65The Scottish Office occupies a special position among Departments. Its direct administration work is comparatively small and its functions are largely concerned with the supervision and co-ordination with the Central Government of the Depart-ments in Edinburgh. This liaison work covers a very wide field of business and is of a kind which requires an unusually large proportion of higher posts.Since 1913/14 a great variety of new duties have devolved upon the Office, especially those arising from the passing of the Police (Scotland) Act, 1919; Repre-sentation of the People Acts, 1918 and 4.921; the Temperance (Scotland) ^Act;&quot; the Licensing Act and the Land Settlement (Scotland) Act, 1919.We do not see any prospect of reducing the staff.There is one item, however, in this Estimate to which we call attention, viz., the provision which is asked for the maintenance of a &quot; Drifter &quot; Service, mainly serving various small ports in Skye and on the west coast of Rossshire.This service was instituted during the war at a time when the usual steamer services were cut down, and it is now administered by the Scottish Office at an annual cost of between  1,000 and  2,000 per annum.In view of the fact that other steamer services are now available, we think that this &quot;Drifter&quot; Service, subsidised by the Exchequer, should be withdrawn, the Estimate being reduced accordingly by  1,500.CONCLUSION.In view of the suggested discontinuance of the &quot;Drifter&quot; Service, we are of opinion that this Estimate should be reduced from  53,775 to  52,275, a saving of  1,500, to which must be added the saving of  2,564, the amount by which the Scottish Office have reduced their Provisional Estimate of July last. The total reduction would therefore be  4,064.[7802]

It must be pointed out that the Audited Expenditure for the year 1913/14 quoted above refers only to the money provided by Parliament for the salaries and expenses of the National Health Insurance Commission (Scotland); the Local Government Board for Scotland, and the Highlands and Islands (Medical Services) Board, and for services administered by those Departments. The Estimates for 1921/22 and 1922/23 refer, of course, to the Scottish Board of Health, which was established on the 1st July, 1919, with the powers formerly assigned to the Local Government Board for Scotland and to the Scottish insurance Commission. Shortly afterwards, it also took over the powers and duties of the Highlands and Islands (Medical Services) Board and certain powers of the Scottish Education Department and the Privy Council.In general, the policy and practice of the Scottish Board of Health follow those of the English Ministry of Health, on which we have already made recommendations in our First Interim Report.2. T*he following table gives a comparative analysis of the main heads of the Audited Expenditure for 1913/14, the Estimate for 1921/22 and the Provisional Estimate for 1922/23 :&apos;-	Audited Expenditure. -1913/14.

Revised Estimate.The Scottish Board of Health have now revised their Provisional Estimate of last July in the light of the recommendations which we have made on the Ministry of Health Estimates in Part II, Chapter 2, of our First Interim Report. It is not necessary, therefore, for us to analyse and criticise in detail the figures of the Provisional Estimate, but we proceed&quot; instead to show how the reductions which are now proposed in the revised Estimate compare with the Estimates for 1921/22 and
with the Provisional Estimate of July last for 1922/23. The following table shows the comparative figures and results :  41		(A) Estimate, 11)21/22.	(B) Provisional Estimate, 1922/23..

Housing.The drastic cut made in July last in the Housing programme extended also to Scotland, the latter&apos;s share of Local Authority Housing Scheme houses being cut down to 25,550 as against England&apos;s 176,000. The following table shows a comparison of the figures for Housing Grants as estimated for 1921/22, as provisionally estimated for 1922/23, and as they now appear in the Revised Estimate for 1922/23:  	Estimate, 1921/22.	Provisional Estimate, 1922/23.	Revised Estimate, 1922/23.Gross total	  2,246,724	  1,077,724	  896,320Appropriations-in-Aid (Refund by Local Authorities in respect of purchase of housing- material, &amp;(;.)	1,048,000	542,500	893.935Nrt total	1,108,724	535,224	2,885The Scottish Estimate of their deficit on Local Authorities&apos; Housing Schemes in 1922/23 is  300,000 only as against the English figure of  10,000,000. This appears to be very favourable to the Scottish schemes when compared with the English figure on a population basis. The explanation is, however, that owing to the greater difficulties of securing labour and materials, the progress of building in Scotland has been very much slower than in England and whereas the subsidy to Local Authorities in England will practically reach its maximum in 1922/23, in Scotland the maximum deficit will not be reached till 1923/24, and possibly not till the year after that. Further, Local Authorities in Scotland have their accounts made up to the 15th May. They receive payments on account from time to time, but any final balance due to them in respect of their financial year is paid in the next Government
financial year. We fear, therefore, that the full deficit in Scotland is only postponed, but, on the other hand, the slow rate of building in Scotland will react favourably on the total deficit in that a much larger proportion of houses will be constructed during the period of falling prices than in the case of England.5. Public Health Services.Under this heading are included Grants for various Services, as in the case of the Ministry of Health.   The following table shows the recurrent expenditure : Description of Service.Estimated ScottishGrants in 1921/22.Scottish Board Scottish Hoardof Health Provisional Estimate, 1922/23.of Health revised estimate, 1922/23.Oommittee&apos;s Recommenda-tions for 1922/23.Scottish Proportion, viz.,. jll/80thsof what : Committee have !

Tuberculosis (Maintenance and Capital).(a.) Maintenance. The total provision, actual and prospective, of beds in England and Wales for the treatment of Tuberculosis is 22,750. The comparable figure for Scotland is 4,688. The English figure represents a drastic reduction of the provision agreed between the Treasury and the Ministry of Health in February 1921. The Scottish Board of Health, on the other hand, appears to have made no corresponding reduction. It is admitted that Tuberculosis is more prevalent in Scotland than in England and Wales, and consequently, we understand the Treasury allowed a more generous margin to Scotland than in the case of England. On the other hand, the actual number of beds available in Scotland is higher than the Treasury contemplated.We recommend that the grant for Scottish Tuberculosis maintenance should be limited to  269,000, which is the latest Estimate of the expenditure in 1921/22 (excluding non-recurrent items), and this is much more than the Grant would be on the proportionate basis of England and Wales.(b.) Capital. A provision of  24,000 is asked for in the Revised Estimate, in respect of capital expenditure on Sanatoria. We would, however, point out that under the Finance Act, 1911, a sum of  1,500,000 was earmarked for Sanatoria Capital Grants in the Consolidated Fund. Of this sum, Scotland&apos;s share amounted to  158,000. We are informed that Scotland still has in hand sufficient to meet such capital expenditure on Sanatoria as is likely to be incurred in 1921/22 and 1922/23. In these circumstances, we recommend that the Scottish Board of Health should meet their capital expenditure out of the remaining balance which they have in hand, and that the additional Grant of  24,000 should be withheld. 7. Maternity and Child Welfare ... ...      120,000Venereal Diseases     ... ... ...       65,000Welfare of the Blind ... ... ...       14,000We recommend that these grants be allowed.
8. Port Sanitation:  7,000.As in the case of a similar item in the Ministry of Health Estimates, we suggest that as this expense was, until recently, borne by the locality, the Exchequer Grant should cease.9. Constitution of Board.The present constitution of the Scottish Board of Health is made up of the following paid members: -1 Chairman,1 Member,2 Medical Members,1 Legal Member,1 Woman Member,making 6 in all, with salaries ranging from  1,000 to  1,800 per annum, together with bonus in all cases. We are not sufficiently acquainted with the duties of the Board to be able to make a recommendation on this matter, but it has been suggested to us that the present number of members is excessive and might be reduced to 3, viz., a Chairman and 2 other administrative members. Any such change would require amendment of the Scottish Board of Health Act, 1919, but nevertheless we suggest that the matter should be dealt with.CONCLUSIONS.As a result of our consideration, we are of opinion that :-The revised Estimate shows a proper reduction in accordance with the principles contained in our recommendations on the Ministry of Health Estimates in our First Interim Report, but that further reductions should be made in the case of certain grants for Public Health Services, with a consequent further saving of  42,000. The reductions on the Provisional Estimate for 1922/23 will therefore be :- 1.

The gross reduction shown in the Revised Estimates for 1922/23, as compared with the Estimates for 1921/22, is  179,400, of which  72,000 is due to fall of bonus and  76,000 to decrease of the staff employed on the house-building work performed by the Department as agents for certain Local Authorities under the Government Housing Scheme. The curtailment of this work has, however, reduced the estimated receipts from the charges made for overhead expenses from  150,000 to  15,000, so that the net reduction is  44,400.2.

This expenditure is governed by-the requirements of other Departments, subject to the control of the Treasury, and the increase in the staff of the Department and its expenditure, therefore, reflects the expansion of the Public Service which has taken place during and since the War.We are informed that the Directorate of Lands. and Accommodation is still fully occupied with the changes and concentrations required as temporary staffs diminish, and that the Maintenance Staff of the Directorate of Works has been strengthened to enable a stricter scrutiny to be applied to Departmental demands.While the work of the Department will fall with the diminution of Government activities, the staff cannot be reduced pari passu with the reduction in Government staffs generally, oAving to the work involved in concentrating the diminishing staffs in as few buildings as possible and disposing of the accommodation vacated.CONCLUSION.In view of the foregoing consideration, we are not in a position to recommend any reduction of the revised Estimate of  538,500, which compares with the Provisional Estimate of  559,500, but we consider that the staff of the Department should be kept under constant review and that substantial further reductions should be possible by the beginning of the financial year 1923/24.* Allowing for the transfer from the Public Buildings Vote to this Vote of Stores Staff costing  3,500.

When the Provisional Estimates were framed full particulars of these requirements for 1922-23 had not been obtained, and the Estimates were, therefore, compiled upon a rationing basis equivalent, on the whole, to two-thirds of the current year&apos;s provision. Since that date examination of the detailed requirements has enabled further reductions to be effected, particularly as regards New Works, and the following revised figures are now put forward :  Royal Palaces ... ...Osborne Royal ParksHouses of Parliament Buildings Miscellaneous Legal Buildings Art and Science Buildings Diplomatic and Consular building Revenue Buildings Labour and Health Buildings Public Buildings House Building Housing Schemes War Memorials	Increase or	Decrease as comparedNet	with ProvisionalEstimates.

tit;General.The main items which compose the foregoing total are as follows :   New Works (exclusive of Housing Schemes) 1,391,463Maintenance     ... ... ... ... 1,922,630Rentals ... ... ... ... 1,115,005Fuel, Light and Water   ... ....... 1,006,220Furniture ... ... ... ... 355,4152. New Works. .Approximately half this provision is for the completion of works in progress. The only considerable items for new permanent buildings are :  (a.) New Spirit Building at the Natural History - Museum .......... ..... 39,500This building is being provided to avoid serious risk of fire to the main building, as well as to provide accommodation for collections dangerously overcrowded.  34,500 of the total amount is a re-vote of provision already made but not expended. &apos;(&amp;.) New Science Museum        ... ... ... 36,500This building, which was urgently needed to relieve congestion in the Science Museum, was partially erected under a pre-war contract, and the reinforced concrete skeleton structure is in danger of serious deterioration through exposure to the weather. It is proposed to complete a section of the building at an estimated cost of approximately  107,000 spread over the next three years. The Science Museum will then vacate a portion of the Imperial Institute in which it is proposed to accommodate the Imperial War Museum, thus saving a rent of  25,000 a year now paid by that Museum for its premises at the Crystal Palace. This arrangement, besides avoiding an increase of this rent on the expiration of the present lease in 1924, should enable additional revenue to be obtained by the Museum from admission fees. (c.) New Post Office Buildings   ... ... ...       146,708In addition to Minor Post Office Works        ... 54,725We are informed that the proposed new works to be commenced in the year are confined to cases in which new accommodation has been seriously needed for many years and cannot be postponed without detriment to the work of the Post Office as a revenue earning undertaking. (d.) Inland Wireless Stations       ... ... ...      34,000The above consideration does not appear to apply to this item, and&apos; we think that it might be omitted, with the exception of  4,000 which is required to complete work in progress.No provision has been made for buildings m connection with the Imperial Wireless Chain, to which reference is made in our Report on the Post Office. If this scheme is proceeded with in 1922/23 an expenditure of  200,000 might be involved.A provision of  257,000 is proposed for the provision of temporary Employment Exchange accommodation,  82,000 being required to complete work in progress We are informed that no permanent buildings are contemplated and that the policy is to provide temporary buildings only where hired accommodation is found to be unsuitable or difficult to obtain. We understand, however, that the provision of temporary hutments would only be more economical than hirings if they are likely to be required for about ten years. In view of the uncertainty as to the future of the Employment Exchanges, we think that hirings should be resorted to wherever at all possible, and that the proposed provision might, therefore, be reduced by at least  50,000.
3. Maintenance.The following comparison of expenditure on Government buildings in Great Britain indicates that steps have already been taken to restrict the expenditure under this head, regard being had to the fact that the work for which the Department is now responsible is estimated to be more than 100 per cent, in excess of the liability in 1913/14:- Provision for 1913/14 ... ... ...        506,544Provision for 1913/14 based on estimated increased cost of maintenance during 1922/23  ... ... ... ...      1,196,813Provision in revised Estimates 1922/23 ...      1,877,430Detailed evidence has been supplied to us showing that reduced standards of engineering and building maintenance have been adopted.We think that the Department is actively pursuing economies and we do not suggest any further reduction of the revised standards. In view, however, of the continued tendency of prices to fall and of the need for economy, we think that a further over-all reduction of, say, 5 per cent, might be made on the total maintenance provision in these Votes.4. Rentals.Systematic inspection has been made of the accommodation in London with the result that the superficial area per head has been reduced from 100 square feet in 1913/14 to 85 square feet in 1921, and in spite of the substantial increases in rents the annual cost per head of rented accommodation is less than in 1914. This inspection is being extended as the staff available permits, to the Provinces, where, excluding buildings to which the standard is inapplicable, the average is now 98 square feet per head. We are informed that the application of a standard of 80 square feet per head to clerical staffs in London and the country generally would produce an ultimate saving of nearly  200,000 a year, and we recommend that steps should be taken to secure this concentration at the earliest possible date.Arrangements are also being considered for the housing of Government staffs wherever possible in the suburban areas rather than in the centre of London, e.g., the Ministry of Pensions building at Acton. Until, however, the approximate normal staffs of Government Departments have been fixed, the question of further decentralisation cannot be effectively dealt with.The recommendations which we have made elsewhere in our Reports, if adopted, should effect a substantial reduction in the accommodation required for Depart-mental staffs. Time is, however, required for the concentration of the remaining staffs and the surrender of vacated premises, and any savings obtained in 1922/23 would, we understand, be offset in that year by the expenditure on removals and dilapidations.In these circumstances we do not&apos;recommend any reduction of the provision proposed under this head.5. Fuel, Light and Water.The restrictions imposed during the war upon the consumption of fuel are still in force in Government buildings. In particular, Government buildings in London have been given a definite rationed allowance of fuel against which the records of consumption are checked and it is considered that the allowance now given is the minimum attainable without involving hardship or loss of efficiency. No immediate fall can be expected in the charges for lighting, and additional charges for water will result from the increased rates imposed by the Metropolitan Water Board under an Act of last Session.In these circumstances it would not appear to be possible to reduce this item.6. Furniture.Economies are being effected by standardisation and by reduction in the variety and quality of furniture issued to departmental grades. More rigorous scrutiny is also applied to departmental requisitions and visits of inspection are made to Government Departments with the object of withdrawing into store furniture not actually in use. The cost of the standard furniture supplied to each departmental grade is approximately the same as pre-war in spite of the fact that current prices [7802] K 2
have increased at least 100 per cent. Beyond emphasising the importance of scrutinising departmental requisitions and maintaining a uniform standard of supplies, we make no recommendation.7. Staff.The staff borne on these Votes compares as follows : August 1, 191-4.   August 1 1921.    April 1, 1922.Administrative and Clerical        471 1,438 1,360Industrial ... ...      1,707 8.589 7,425Apart from the general increase of the Departments work as an agent for supplying increased requirements of Government Departments generally, the number of industrial staff has been increased by the extended employment of direct labour, both in connection with normal activities and with the House Building Scheme. In the Engineering Division of the Department about 1,000 men employed on main-tenance and repair services, who were formerly obtained from a Contractor remunerated by a commission of 6 per cent, on the wages paid have now been taken into the direct employment of the Department, with a consequent saving estimated at  4,710 per annum.In the Supplies Division about 600 men are directly employed upon Maintenance Services, the majority of which were formerly executed by contract. It is admitted, however, that in these cases the work has been found not to lend itself so readily to economical working by direct labour, and it is intended, therefore, to revert to contract arrangements.In the case of House Building, the employment of direct labour was adopted at a time when it was found impossible to obtain satisfactory contracts. The workmen employed on these Schemes, who numbered 4,326 in December last, will not be required as soon as these Schemes have reached completion in the course of 1922/23.The number of Night Watchmen directly employed by the Department is 280 at the present time as compared with 17 in August 1914, when 44 Commissionaires, supplied by the Corps of Commissionaires, were also employed. This large increase is attributed to the increase in the number of buildings in the charge of the Department, the reduction of the working week from 72 hours to 48 hours and to emergency arrangements arising out of the Irish situation last year. In existing circumstances we consider that a substantial reduction should be effected in this staff.8. Police.We understand that a saving of  10,800 a year would be effected by the substitution of Night Watchmen for the Police employed upon night-watching duties in the Palace of Westminster, and by the substitution of Commissionaires for the Police employed at the Public &quot;Record Office. In view of the disproportionate cost of Police at the present time, we recommend that this should be considered by the Authorities concerned.In addition to the foregoing general observations, we comment upon the following particular Votes : 9. Osborne.Under the Osborne Estate Act, 1902, such part of Osborne House as was in the personal occupation of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria is, with the exception of certain Apartments preserved as State Apartments, open to the Public at a charge of 8d. per head. The remainder of Osborne House and Grounds are maintained as a Convalescent Home for the benefit of Naval and Military Officers. Before the war each patient paid 2s. Qd. a day towards the cost of his messing. This charge has since been increased to 3s. Qd. In view of the fact that the charge in a private Convalescent Home of a similar nature would probably not be less than  5 5s. a week, we think that it would not be unreasonable to increase the charge made at Osborne to  2 2s. a week.10. Art and Science Buildings.Of the increase in the Revised Estimate  149,000 is due to the transfer to this Vote of expenditure formerly charged against the Public Buildings Vote, in respect of Museums and Galleries, and of the cost of supplying fittings and exhibition cases formerly charged against the Museum Votes.
11. War Services.   Public Buildings.The Revised Estimate for this item is  719,450, as compared with  550,000 in the Provisional Estimate.  154.000 is for the reinstatement of premises already surrendered, and  70,700 compensation payable in respect of commandeered hotels. The balance is for rentals, maintenance of buildings, and supplies for the Disposal and Liquidation Commission and other temporary Departments.12. House Building.This Vote was taken in 1921/22 to enable the Office.of Works to undertake certain House Building Schemes as agents of Local Authorities under the Govern-ment Housing Scheme. The expenditure incurred is recovered from the Local Authority concerned with a charge for overhead expenses, and the Vote is required for the purpose of providing temporary working capital only. No new schemes are being undertaken, and the liability of the Department under the schemes now in progress will be practically terminated by the end of 1922/23.In these circumstances, we make no recommendation.13. Housing Schemes.This Vote is required for the purpose of financing the administration of certain Housing Schemes erected during the war by the Ministry of Munitions and a Housing Scheme at Woolwich erected by the Office of Works under the Housing Act, 1914, together with certain small schemes now being taken over from the Service Departments. The object of these schemes was to provide accommodation for Munition Workers in towns in which it was found to be seriously inadequate. No fresh schemes have been undertaken since the Armistice, but it was considered necessary to complete the schemes then in progress.The Gross Estimate provides for the expenditure required for purchase of sites, payment of rates and maintenance, and the rents obtained are taken as Appro p,r negotiations-in-Aid.The Provisional Estimate covers twenty-three schemes comprising approxi-mately 9,500 houses and certain hostels. Of the houses, about 5,600 are temporary structures. In the ease of only five or six schemes have definite arrangements been made for the transfer, at the end of periods varying from three to seven years after the war, of the schemes to Local Authorities or others. As regards the remaining schemes, the efforts so far made to arrange for their transfer to Local Authorities or for sale have not proved successful.We are informed that the total capital expenditure incurred upon, these schemes amounts to  4,526,000, which will be increased by certain expenditure necessary to acquire sites now held under the Defence of the Realm Act only. It has been found necessary to add  30,250 to the Estimate for this purpose in order to avoid the heavy expenditure which would otherwise be necessary upon reinstatement if the sites were returned to their owners.The gross rentals amount to  268,000, and the outgoings are estimated at  150,000. The arrears of rent in Oct6ber 1921 amounted to  21,545, this excessive amount being attributed to the effects of the depression of trade and the coal dispute, as well as in certain cases to rent strikes, now terminated. Allowing for outgoings and losses due to bad debts and voids, the net rental would not appear likely to exceed  90,000 a year, which would represent barely 2 per cent, on the capital expenditure incurred.We concur strongly in the view expressed to us by the First Commissioner of Works that it is extremely undesirable on general grounds that the Government should continue to own house property which is not required for direct Government employees. We recommend that, as in the case of the houses erected by Local Authorities under the Government Housing Scheme, vigorous efforts should be made to effect sales.14. War Memorials.It was originally contemplated that a number of War Memorials in France, Gallipoli and Salonika should be provided by the Office of Works, but it was subse-Gross Estimate.Net Estimate.  1921/221922/23 Provisional 1922/23 Revised    ,418,000 263,600 293.770143,300 10,800 52,770
quently decided that the work should be undertaken by the Imperial War Graves Commission. One memorial, however, had already been undertaken by the Office of Works, namely, a statue to be erected in Brussels as an acknowledgment of the thanks of the Government for the assistance and sympathy afforded by the Belgian people to British Prisoners of War during the period immediately following the Armistice.The Revised Estimate of  2,500 for 1922/23, which is now substituted for the Provisional Estimate of  25,000 framed in July last in pursuance of the earlier policy, is required to complete this work.CONCLUSIONS.As a result of our consideration, we are of opinion: (1.) That in view of falling prices and the need for economy, a reduction might be effected in the provision for maintenance of buildings made in these votes.(2.) That, while no reduction in the expenditure on Rentals appears to be possible in 1922/23, the diminution and concentration of Government staffs, which should result from our recommendations, should enable a substantial economy to be effected under this head in the following year.(3.) That the provision proposed for the erection of further Inland Wireless Stations should be omitted.(4.) That resort should be had to hired accommodation wherever possible for Employment Exchanges rather than to the erection of temporary buildings.(5.) That the number of Police employed in connection with the Houses of Parliament buildings and the Public Record Office might be reduced.(6.) That in all the circumstances, the net total of the Estimates for Public Works and buildings under the Office of Works for 1922/23 should be reduced to  6,000,000, as compared with the Provisional Estimates of  6,643,750 and the revised Estimates of  6,201,120.

These savings will be entirely automatic. It is not possible to forecast at this moment what premises will be given up and at what dates, so that no Estimate of the saving in respect of Rates for 1922/23 can as yet be given. We, therefore, make no recommendation.

Expenditure on Staff and Police             351,593 327,267Purchase Grants       ...         ...             51,458 42,425All other Expenditure           ...            132,435 .          64,712Gross Expenditure ... 535,486 434,404Receipts ... ... 28,715 -   28,540Net Expenditure 506,771 405,8642. From this table, it will be seen that over 80 per cent, of the Estimate is in respect of the cost of personnel. The functions discharged by the staffs employed in the National Collections are very varied, ranging from research, recording and
the purchase of new objets oVart down to the safeguarding of the Collections and the cleaning of the premises.As regards the higher and semi-technical staff, we have no comments to make. We think, however, that further economies might be produced by a close investigation into the question of the size of the warding staff required at all these Museums and Galleries, especially in the case of the British Museum and the Natural History Museum, where a reduction of the number of expensive Regular Police and their substitution by ex-soldier warders would effect a saving.3. Purchase Grants.The,sum provided for Purchase Grants is shown in the following table :-British Museum Natural History Museum National Gallery National Portrait Gallery Imperial War Museum Geological Museum  .. National Galleries (Scotland)1913-14. ___\	1921-22.	1922-23.e	 	 25,000	25,000	25,0005,500	6,500	6,5005,000	8,000	8,000750	1,038	1,0001	9,000 525	350		5251,400	1,400	1,40038,000	51,458	42,425The Wallace Collection and the London Museum receive no Purchase Grants.We have carefully considered whether any. reduction in these Grants is justified, but having regard to the special opportunities which now occur for making purchases for the Nation as the result of the breaking-up of many continental and private Collections, owing to the war, we do not recommend any such reduction, especially as we understand that the suspension or reduction of the National Purchase Grants discourages gifts or bequests of private benefactors.&apos;On the other hand, we are of opinion that a good deal can be done to increase the revenue of Museums and Galleries as we proceed to explain.4. Admission Fees.We think that the revenue can be considerably increased by the imposition of a small entrance fee for admission to Collections on certain days of the week. We understand that the National Gallery, the London Museum and the Wallace Collection have increased the number of paying days to four a week,, and in the case of the National Gallery the results have been very satisfactory. We recommend that such a rule should be made general for all National Museums and Art Galleries without distinction, in view of the growing expenses of these Institutions. The retention of three free days a week, including Saturdays and Sundays, and the granting of &quot; free passes &quot; to bond fide students would, in our opinion, preserve all the necessary educational facilities.The adoption of this recommendation is estimated to result in the following increase of revenue in 1922/23 :   British Museum Natural History Museum National Portrait Gallery National Galleries (Scotland) Geological Museum3,500 300 100 20010,100At the same time, we are of opinion that other sources of income should be developed as far as possible on a uniform basis, and that any articles sold should be sold at a strictly economic rate.5. British Museum.In examining the Estimates of the British Museum, we are struck by the increased cost of bookbinding.   This item, which in 1913/14 cost  11,900, is estimated in 1921/22 at  26,500, and in 1922/23 at  22,000.  We suggest that, in [7802] ^    L
present circumstances, this item should be reduced by  3,000, and the incidental expenses at the Natural History Museum should be reduced by  500.6. Imperial War Museum.The Imperial War Museum, which is now housed in the Crystal Palace, was instituted in 1917, and although the preliminary work is not yet completed, the volume of work is steadily decreasing. The expenditure has shown a steady decline since the high-water mark of 1919/20, as is shown in the following figures: But apart from this current expenditure, there is the cost of housing the Collection, which is borne on the Vote for Public Buildings (Great Britain). The principal item is the rent of  25,000 per annum, which is paid to the Crystal Palace Trustees. We understand that the lease runs till the 31st March, 1924, and although no immediate economy can be effected in this respect, we think that less expensive accommodation could be found possibly in one of the existing Government buildings which is not fully occupied. We understand that a Committee is considering the possible removal of the Museum to the Imperial Institute. Prom  80,000 to  90,000 has already been spent on the purchase of relics, apart from numerous gifts, and valuable pictures have been collected. There is an unexpired liability on the lease of the Crystal Palace, and the expense of storing the contents of the Museum elsewhere until it has found -a permanent and more economical home would be very great.   In these circumstances, we make no recommendation.7. We have not mentioned in this Report the three Museums (the Victoria and Albert, the Science and Bethnal Green Museums), which are controlled by the Board of Education, and the expenses of which are borne on the Vote of that Board, nor the Royal Scottish Museum, which is controlled and financed by the Scottish Education Department. The English Museums have already been dealt with in our Report on the Education Estimates in our First Interim Report, and the Scottish Museums should be dealt with on similar lines. We would only say further that the suggestion which we have made for the extension of admission fees should, in our opinion, apply to these Museums also and the increased revenue derived therefrom should prove helpful to them in view of the reduction of the Grants to them which we have recommended in our First Interim Report.We are of opinion that, in view of the economies which we have suggested and the means of increasing revenue which we have recommended, the net sum of  405,864, which is asked for in the Provisional Estimates for 1922/23 should be reduced to  392,264, a saving of  13,600.1919/201920/21 (estimated) ...1921/22 (estimated) ...1922/23 (proposed) ... 59,751 50,000 37.170 20,000CONCLUSIONS.
SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION, &amp;c. Class IV (8).This Vote consists of grants, mainly of small amount, to various learned and scientific societies.

A grant of  130,000 to the Medical Research Council.2. A grant of  8,750 to the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau.3. An increased grant to the National Museum of Wales.As regards (1), the grant to the Medical Research Council accounts for more than half the total Vote. We are assured that the work of this Council in Preventive Medical Research produces very substantial economies in administrative services falling on other Departments, and at a time when the prevention and combating of disease and the alleviation of physical disability is a matter of such vital concern from an economic as well as from a humanitarian point of view, we do not feel[7802] L 2
justified in &quot;recommending any reduction of a Grant-in-Aid of medical research conducted by a body of selected specialists.As regards (2), Grant to the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau, it will be observed that it is proposed to make a grant of  8,750, which is a reduction of  2,000 on the grant for the current year. We have no doubt that the Bureau is doing valuable work, but in the present circumstances, we endorse the redxretion which the Treasury have proposed.As regards (3), we understand that the grant to the National Museum of Wales is in respect of maintenance and building fund. It is estimated that no smaller provision than  13,000 will suffice for maintenance if the Museum is to be run with efficiency. The balance of the proposed grant, viz.,  7,000, represents what the Exchequer may reasonably be expected to contribute to the building fund in 1922/23 in fulfilment of its obligation, which is to provide total grants for this purpose within a maximum of about  116,000. The actual contribution each year depends upon equivalent outside contributions.The chief decreases, which are apparent,and not real, as the grants now appear in other Votes, are as follows : 1. The grant to the Royal Society now stands at  9,000 whereas in 1913/14 it was  27,150. Of this latter amount, however,  22,150 was for the National Physical Laboratory, its buildings and Aeronautical Section, and also Eskdalemuir Observatory. Provision for these latter services has, since 1918, been made in other Votes.2. There is now no grant to the Metereological Office, which, in 1913/14 amounted to  20,000. This is accounted for by the fact that the Metereological Office is now administered by the Air Ministry, at an approximate cost of  150,000, on which we have commented in our First Interim Report.CONCLUSIONS.We are of opinion that the grant to the Medical Research Council, which is by far the largest item, should be as proposed by the Treasury.As regards the smaller grants, we are averse from an arbitrary and uniform reduction on a percentage basis on the ground that the saving to the Exchequer would be small compared with the detriment which would be caused to the activities of the learned and scientific world and the discouragement which would be given to private subscriptions and donations if the Exchequer grants were reduced. We therefore recommend that the Provisional Estimate, as framed by the Treasury, should be accepted, with the qualification that it may be possible, under the terms of the Irish Settlement, to omit the  2,200 proposed for the four Academies and Societies in Ireland. Against this possible saving of  2,200 must be set the increase of  5,110 by which the revised Estimate submitted by the Treasury exceeds their Provisional Estimate of July last.

But this figure is not really comparable with that of 1921/22 because part of the expenditure collected on this Vote in 1921/22 was, before the war, spread over the Votes of many Departments, who paid fees to the Royal Society or other investigators for research or testing work undertaken on their behalf. In addition to the above  7,000, the following grants were made in respect of the Laboratory in 1913/14:  Buildings     .. .. .. .. .. ..      5,000Aeronautical Section   .. .. .. .. ...      9,150Eskdalemuir Observatory (now under Air Ministry) ..      1,000The Provisional Net Estimate for 1922/23 of  330,287 has since been reduced to  298,071, a saving of  32,216.2. The following table shows the comparative numbers of staff employed: 	1 August 1,  j   August 1, 1914.            1921.

The relative proportions of scientific staff of the National Physical Laboratory, the Fuel Research Station and other Research Boards cannot be determined until the programme of research for the year has been settled.
The staff is composed of : (a.) Administrative.(6.) Scientific and Technical.(c.) Financial and Clerical.(d.) Draughtsmen, Warders, Messengers, &amp;c.In all these cases, with the exception of (&amp;), the Treasury exercises the same control of staff as it does in other Departments. In the case of (b) Scientific and Technical Staff it is not possible for any outside or unscientific authority to estimate the number of persons or the length of time needed for the completion of a piece of research work. We think, however, that the incentive to engage or retain superfluous staff is small in a Department like this, where expenditure on personnel is governed by the total amount of funds available for the prosecution of researches and where there are no statutory and few administrative functions which might be over-elaborated or extravagantly conducted.3. Origin of Department.This Department did not exist before the war, but various grants were made by the Treasury to the Board of Education and the Royal Society for researches which are now conducted by this Department, while, in addition, fees were paid by various Government Departments from their own Votes for research work under-taken on their behalf. In the early years of the war, the Government were impressed with the great desirability of setting up some permanent Research organisation which they felt would be essential in the period of industrial reconstruction after the war. Consequently, the Department was established early in 1917 with a separate Parliamentary Vote which provided also for the expenses of the National Physical Laboratory and the Fuel Research Board. The Geological Survey and the Geological Museum were transferred to this Vote from the Board of Education in 1920.4. Work of the Department.The various functions of the Department can be grouped as follows :-1. Headquarters Staff     ... ... -2. Grants to Researchers and Learned Societies 3. National Physical Laboratory   ... 4. Geological Survey 5. Research Boards and Committees 6. Geological Museum 7. Fuel Research Board ...Estimated Cost in 1922/23. ... . 38,287 51,600 84,000 52,560 49,876 8,232 45,732We have already dealt with the Geological Museum in our Report on Museums generally and have recommended that there should be an increase of revenue by means of admission fees.5. Special Fund.In addition to providing for the annual expenses of the Department, Parliament voted in 1917/18 a capital sum of  1,000,000 to be expended on industrial research. The fund so created is not in the hands of the Government, but of a body of Trustees set up by Charter, who expend it in the form of   for   grants to approved Research Societies established by particular industries. This is not, however, a percentage grant, as it is based on contributions by the Associations, not on their expenditure, and the Government proportion stops altogether or is reduced rapidly after a certain point is reachedi Since 1919/20, the Treasury has required the interest on the fund, subject to certain prior charges, to be appropriated in aid of the Vote and a sum of  36,192 was so appropriated in the current year.
6. Comparison of the Estimates.Previous to 1920/21, the annual net estimates of this Department from the date of its inception were :  1917/18 ... ... ... ...       63,325(plus special grant of  1,000,000).   -1918/19 ... ... ... ...      148,3501919/20 ... ... ... ...      242,815The net Estimates for 1920/21 ( 556,868) showed so great an increase on the already expanding figures of the previous three years that the Vote was specially examined. Reductions were made and the fees charged to outside bodies for work done on their behalf at the National Physical Laboratory and in other Government Research Institutions were increased. This, as will be seen from the following table, has led to a substantial increase of the Appropriations-in-Aid, and there has been a steady decline in the gross as well as the net total expenditure during the last three vears.1920/21. 1921/22. 1922/23.     Gross ... ... 644,628 562,885 466,497Appropriations-in-Aid 87,760 146,962 136,210Net Total      ... 556,868 416,023 330,287This Department, like all others, was instructed, in May last, to effect at least a 20 per cent, reduction on their expenditure of 1921/22 when framing their Provisional Estimate for 1922/23. The Department succeeded in effecting this and presented a Provisional Net Estimate of  330,287. Since arriving at that figure, the Department and the Treasury have agreed on an additional cut of  17,700 and as the result of a further review, the Department have intimated that a still further reduction can be made, which will bring their Net Estimate down to  298,071. This recent reduction is partly due to the fact that the Department has reinvested more profitably the outstanding balance of their special fund and they are thereby enabled to appropriate in aid of their Vote a sum of  45,000 instead of  36,000.7. Present Work of the Department.The work of the Department now comprises :-(a.) Testing and research work for outside bodies for which substantial fees are charged.(b.) Research work for Government Departments which can be more economically and efficiently;carried out by this Department than by leaving the Govern-ment Departments to carry out their work unco-ordinated.(c.) Scientific Research bearing on industrial problems.CONCLUSIONS.We are of opinion that the activities of this Department have been minutely examined with a view to obtaining a reduction of expenditure, and we are unable to recommend any further reduction beyond what has been effected. The result is that the Provisional Estimate of  330,287 is reduced to  298,071, a saving of  32,216.
PART XIV. FOREIGN OFFICE AND DIPLOMATIC AND consular services.Chapter I.August 1,	August 1,	April 11914.	1921.	r    1922.187	f   273 1   590	421 458187	863	879FOREIGN OFFICE. 1913/14 Audited Expenditure    ... ...       67,8681921/22 Estimates        ... ... ...      212,5201922/23 Provisional Estimates    ... ...      181,3101. The reduction in 1922/23 as compared with 1921/22 is due to the fall of Bonus and anticipated savings on Messengers&apos; Travelling. Since the Provisional Estimates were submitted, it has been decided to transfer to tfhis Vote certain duties from Navy Votes, the cost of which is estimated at  32,010. With this and other minor adjustments the revised Estimate for the Foreign Office for 1922/23 is  216,679. Excluding the transferred staff, the numbers of staff compare as follows : Permanent ... Temporary   ...Total   .Of the increased numbers the staff of the Passport Office accounts for 290. The cost of this Office is covered by the fees charged.Apart from the staff of the Passport Office, the staff of the Foreign Office is more than three times as large as it was in 1914. This increase represents the additional work thrown upon the Department as a result of the Peace Treaties and the numerous problems arising out of the resettlement of Europe.2. Higher Division Staff.The Higher Division staff of the Office has increased from a total of 43 before the war to an authorised establishment of 75 at the present time, but we are informed that in addition it is proposed to employ 14 Temporary Higher Division Officers and 11 Junior Administrative Assistants, at a cost of about  10,000 a year. We think that by 1922/23 it should be possible for the Higher Administrative work to be done by the authorised establishment, so as to enable this additional staff to be dispensed with.3. News Department.Further temporary staff costing about  3,000 a year is employed in connection with the News Department, for which provision of  2,900 is also made for incidental expenses. We refer to the News Department again in our Report on the Diplomatic and Consular Estimates, and we think that this expenditure might be saved.4. Communications Department.A special staff of about 30 is engaged on the duty of cyphering and decyphering messages in the Foreign Office and carrying despatches abroad. The estimated cost for salaries in 1922/23 is  13,500, together with  22,500 for travelling, &amp;c, expenses, making  36,000. Prior to the war, the despatch work was performed by 6 King&apos;s Messengers at a cost of  1,650 per annum, plus travelling expenses, and the cyphering work was done chiefly by the ordinary staff.We consider that it should be possible to effect a considerable reduction in the number of cypher telegrams sent, resort being had to despatch by bag in matters not of great urgency, and the recommendations which we make on this subject in our Report on the Estimates for the Diplomatic and Consular Services should appreciably reduce the work of this Department.CONCLUSION.In view of the foregoing considerations, we recommend that the Estimates for the Foreign Office for 1922/23 should be fixed at  195,000, to include the transferred Services, instead of the provisional  181,310 which was increased to  216,679.

The Net Estimate as revised is accordingly reduced to  1,571,439.We proceed to deal with the heads of expenditure seriatim,.2. Diplomatic Services.The numbers of Diplomats for 1914 and 1922/23 compare as follows :-1914, 1922/23.Ambassadors, Ministers, &amp;c.     ... 41 44Counsellors    ... ... ... 12 12Secretaries    ... ... ... 65 75118 131The number of the subordinate staff of Archivists, Clerks and Typists, excluding clerical staff paid from allowances,has increased from 34 in 1913/14to 133in 1922/23. This increase of subordinate staff, for which it is now proposed to obtain trained personnel, relieves the Diplomatic staff proper of a considerable amount of routine work. It should also be pointed out that the Commercial Diplomatic Service, for which  155,000 is provided in the Estimates for the Department of Overseas Trade, [7802] M1913/14 Audited Expenditure ... ... ...        692,3761921 /22 Estimates :-  
has been added. The staff of Commercial Diplomats, numbering 43, has relieved the regular Diplomatic staff of work of a commercial nature, so that the real increase is very much larger than is shown in the table above. In these circumstances, we consider that some reduction should be possible in the number of Junior Diplomats employed. If the total number of Counsellors and Secretaries could be reduced to pre-war numbers a, saving of about  10,000 a year might be effected.Apart from numbers, the increased expenditure is due to increased rates of pay and Rent Allowances, and to provision for Entertainment.The provision for &quot; Frais de Representation &quot; for Ambassadors and Ministers in 1022/23 is  128,200. Before the war &quot; Frais de Representation &quot; fell to be met by the Ambassador out of his salary. In 1914 the total cost of the salaries of 39 Ambassadors and Ministers was  143,102, giving an average salary of  3,670, tlie whole of which was liable to Income Tax. The provision for salaries and frais for 1922/23 is  217,650, an average of  4,950, of which the salary portion only,  2,032, is liable to Income Tax. For the purposes of super-tax an Estimate of the necessary expenditure on frais in 191.3/14 was made, amounting to  81,000, and this compares with the proposed provision of  128,000 in 1922/23. In view of the obligations imposed on representatives of the Government in foreign countries and of present-day costs, we make no recommendation, especially as these allowances are under constant review.Included under this head is a provision of  27,568 for the News Department expenses abroad. Tins provision is for press work in foreign countries, and we do not consider that its continuance so long after the war should be necessary, especially in. view of the great increase in the number of diplomatic representatives of all kinds. We think the sum provided under this head might be saved by an adjustment of duties.3. Consular Services.The great increase in the cost of these Services since 1914 reflects the policy adopted since 1917, of giving active assistance to British trade overseas. In order to give a fair comparison of the expenditure incurred for this purpose, it is necessary to include the cost of the Department of Overseas Trade. On this basis the proposed expenditure appears as follows :  1913/14. 1922/23.   Consular Services   ... ... 427,461 1,153,818Department of Overseas Trade(or corresponding pre-war expenditure    of   ForeignOffice and Board of Trade) 34,000 336,039*461,461 1,489,857It will be seen that the expenditure has increased nearly three and a half times. The revised Estimate for Consular Services for 1922/23 shows a saving of  107,000 on the above figure.The growth of expenditure has been due to a considerable extent to increased rates of pay and to the provision of Rent and Representation Allowances. The number of salaried officers employed overseas compares as follows :  (b.)Overseas Trade Department Service 	1914,	1922/23.Commercial Diplomats	8	43Trade Commissioners	4	12General Consular Service 		Inspectors-General of Consular Establishments		2Consuls-General ...	40	39Consuls ...	84	101Vice-Consuls	113	149Student Interpreters and Probationers	20	62Far Eastern Considar Service 		Consuls-General ...	11	8Consuls ...	25	25Vice-Consuls and. Assistants	53	63Student Interpreters	31	9Total   ...	389	513* Excluding the Petroleum Department.
The cost of subordinate staff, &amp;c, covered by Office Allowances to Consuls in the General Consular Service, has increased from  103,000 in 1913/14 to  252,000. Apart from increased prices and wages, this increase is clue to the additional work thrown upon Consuls in answering commercial enquiries. If the recommendations in our Report on the Department of Overseas Trade as regards the nature of the information which should be given to the British traders are adopted, we consider that sonic economy should be possible in these staffs. We append joint Memoranda (Appendix (A)) furnished by the Foreign Office and the Department of Overseas Trade on the subject. As regards the Consular staffs, while reductions m the number of salaried posts can no doubt only be effected gradually as opportunity offers, we think that an immediate reduction of, say, 10 per cent, in the cost of subordinate staff should be possible.4. Telegrams:  175,000.The revised Estimate shows a reduction of  25,000 on this item. Even so, it is nearly four times the pre-war expenditure, and we are informed that the increase is due mainly to the increased volume of traffic and not to higher rates. Substantial economy should be possible in this expenditure. We believe that a large number of telegrams are sent on matters which might form the subject of ordinary despatches. The habit of telegraphing on every occasion is a habit of the war, when speed was essential and the ordinary means of communication either unsafe or not available. Now that there is a regular messenger service at frequent intervals with all the principal Embassies and Legations in Europe, it should be possible to limit severely the number of telegrams sent, except when Conferences of the highest political importance are in progress. The authority for the transmission of tele-grams abroad should be restricted to a very few high officials. We consider that in this matter pre-war methods and expenditure should be reverted to and that the proposed provision should be reduced to  85,000, as compared with  41,000 before the war.5. Passjport Control:  110,000 gross.The revised Estimate shows a reduction of  46,000 under this head. This service is a matter of policy, and as the cost is covered by the fees charged, we make no observations.6. Refund to India in respect of Far Eastern Services:  89,950.The revised Estimate for this item amounts to  168,550, which includes in addi-tion to the cost of Consular Officers employed in Persia the following amounts :  Maintenance of Lights and Buoys in the Persian Gulf      30,000 Maintenance of Telegraphs in Persia       ... ...      33,550Cost of Indian Troops employed in South Persia as Consular Guards (half expenditure incurred in the last two years)        ... ... ... ...      80,000Under arrangements made as the result of a Royal Commission in 1900, India contributes a fixed sum towards the cost of Diplomatic and Consular Services in China, and shares equally with the British Government the cost of such services, and the kindred services specified above, in Persia and the.Persian Gulf. The Diplomatic Mission in Persia and certain Consular Services are under the control of, and paid for in the first instance by, the British Government, and the other Consular, and all the kindred services are controlled, and paid for in the first instance by India. The determining factor is predominating interest roughly, north and west, British; south and east, Indian. The creation of new posts, and material increases of emoluments require the consent of both Governments. The Consular Posts controlled by India are more expensive relatively, and the expenditure on services incurred in the first instance by India is now the greater, so that the British Government has to make a contribution to India to equate the charges.The provision proposed for 1922/23 cannot be reduced.[7802] M 2
CONCLUSIONS.As the result of our consideration, we are of opinion: (1.) That the special provision for the News Department should cease, the necessary work being performed by the regular Diplomatic staff, in which further economies should be effected.(2.) That as a result of the recommendations in our previous Report on the Department of Overseas Trade, economies should be made in the cost of the Commercial, Diplomatic and Consular Services.(3.) That a substantial reduction should be made in the expenditure upon telegrams.(4.) That in the circumstances the Net Estimates for Diplomatic and Consular Services for 1922/23 should be reduced from the Provisional Estimate of  1,753,033 to  1,435,000.APPENDIX (A).Memoranda by Foreign Office and Department of Overseas Trade.I. Effect on Commercial Diplomatic Service of application of the Recomrnenda-tionsof the Committee on National Expenditure with regard to the Department of Overseas Trade.The attached schedule shows the provision inserted in the estimates for 1922/23 for the Commercial Diplomatic Service. The provision is for forty-three officers at a total cost of . 157,300.The Committee have recommended that the functions of the Department of Overseas Trade should in future be limited to giving general information, and that they should not henceforth give assistance to traders in specific matters of business. Should this recommendation be adopted, it is certain that the activities of the Commercial Diplomatic Service would be very materially reduced, although not to the same extent as in the case of the Headquarters office. It has been estimated that the work at Headquarters would diminish immediately by something like 75 per cent, if the Depart-ment were precluded from giving assistance in specific matters of business. In the&apos; case of the Commercial Diplomatic Officers, while it is true that a con-siderable part of their work is at present concerned with assistance in specific matters of business, the remainder of their duties includes, not only the rendering of general reports such as the Headquarters Department would under the Committee&apos;s recommendation henceforth pass on to the trading community, but also advising and assisting the head of the Mission in economic and financial matters, and rendering reports which are not intended for the trading community, but are designed to assist the work of the Political Departments of the Foreign Office. This work is, and is certain to remain, heavy. It is for this reason impossible to apply a definite percentage reduction to the Commercial Diplomatic Service and it has been necessary to review one by one the countries in which Commercial Diplomatic Officers are at present stationed.In the first place it is probable that, generally speaking, not more than one Commercial Diplomatic Officer would be needed in any country. There are at present twelve subordinate appointments, the holders of which are in the position of assistants to the chief Commercial Diplomatic Officer in. the country. Nine of these subordinate appointments could be abolished. It would, however, be necessary to retain the second posts in China, Germany and Russia. Special reasons exist in each of these countries. In China, it is essential to have one Commercial Diplomatic Officer permanently stationed in the Legation at Peking in order to assist in dealing with the commercial questions which form so large a part of the work of the Legation. The commercial centre of the country is, however, Shanghai, and the presence of another Commercial Diplomatic Officer is required there even for the purposes of general information alone. In Germany the senior post is in Berlin, but it is essential to have another Commercial Secretary in an independent position at Cologne to deal with the occupied territory.
Of the two Commercial Diplomatic Officers for Russia, one is practically a Diplomatic Officer in charge of the Mission now in Moscow, and the other acts as his assistant especially with reference to commercial work. Both are fully occupied at the present time in handling the special relations which subsist with the Soviet Government, and if, and when, normal relations arc restored, one of them will be recpuired for Siberia, oven if his duties arc confined to general information.While is is probably true that on the linos laid down no Commercial Secretary would at the moment be needed in Tin-key, such an officer would inevitably be required there even for the purposes of general information on the resumption of normal relations with that country, and it is therefore necessary to retain provision for the post. The post in Czechoslovakia is retained because its abolition would immediately necessitate a corresponding addition to the Diplomatic staff at Prague.On the strict application of these premises, the Commercial Diplomatic Service could be reduced to the establishment shown in the second part of the schedule, namely, twenty-four officers at an estimated annual cost of  110,000 per annum, as against forty-three officers at a total cost of  157,300 provided for in next year&apos;s estimates.Certain consequences would, hoAvever, be felt which would go some way to diminish the effect of this reduction. In certain countries the abolition of the junior Commercial Diplomatic post, or of the sole Commercial Diplomatic post, would quite clearly involve the need of more Diplomatic assistance at the Mission. This is true, for instance, of the United States and France. Even where it cannot be stated with precision that additional staff would be required at the Mission, the responsibility for general commercial information would, on the abolition of a Commercial Secretary, have to be distributed between the Mission and the Consular staff of the country in some way or other, and requests for additional assistance in some form might thus result.It must also be recognised that the abolition of this large number of posts would leave to be disposed of a number of permanent pensionable officers whom it would be impossible to utilise elsewhere at once or probably at all. The saving indicated also could not be realised completely in the first year of the application of the new principle. There would necessarily be some delay in disposing of officers and closing down the posts.This scheme of reduction is of course put forward not as in itself desirable or even practicable. It is simply an endeavour to interpret the logical consequences of the possible adoption of the recommendations of the Committee with regard to Government assistance in matters of ti-ade.(Signed) (Signed)EYRE A.

If.--Effect on Consular Service of Application of the Recommendation of the Committee on National Expenditure with Regard to the Department of Overseas Trade.It is impossible to estimate in precise figures what reductions of staff, if any, could be effected in the Consular Service&apos; should the recommendations of the Committee as regards the Department of Overseas Trade be adopted.The Consular Service has a variety of duties to perform which are not optional.Political work, more especially in the Near East and in China and Japan, which involves the cultivation of reliable sources of information, the collection and careful sifting of items of political interest the drawing up of reports to the diplomatic missions or to the Foreign Office. Shipping work which includes the administration of the Merchant Shipping Act, entailing in many cases, such as the relief of distressed British seamen, wrecks, the engagement or paying off of crews, con-siderable correspondence with the Board of Trade, the holding of Naval Courts. The relief and repatriation of distressed British subjects, the safeguarding of the interests of British subjects generally, either travelling or resident abroad, which often presents, complicated and lengthy negotiations. The winding up of the estates of deceased British subjects. Passport work which was before the war of no great importance, has now attained large proportions and takes considerable time at the many posts where passport control officers are not stationed.Notarial work and the payment of pensions, the latter having enormously increased in volume since the war.Marriages have to be celebrated.Nationality questions and points of international, law.In countries where we have extra-territorial rights judicial functions must also be performed.The Provisional Estimate for the Consular Service for&apos; the vear 1922/23 is  1,153,818 as compared with  419,991. for 1913/14. There are three reasons for1 this increase.1. The admitted inadequacy of the emoluments formerly &apos; sanctioned for Consular Officers. The findings of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service of 1914 left no doubt on this point. Nothing was done to.remedy the existing conditions until Sir A. Steel MaitlancVs recommendations, in so far as they effected the emoluments of Consular Officers, were accepted by the Cabinet in 1919. Actual scales of salary were then, raised, rent allowances were made universal and a repre-sentation allowance was sanctioned.2. The increased cost of living, for which the new scales of pay were not intended to provide, has necessitated a bonus calculated on the varying increase in the cost of living in different countries. The amount sanctioned is 40 per cent, of this increase for Vice-Consuls and 30 per cent, for more senior grades.3. The increase in. the number of posts under Sir A. Steel Maitlancfs scheme.The number actually sanctioned, which it should be remembered is about one-third of the total number proposed by Sir A. Steel Maitland, is 49, including 7 temporary posts which may eventually be required permanently.While it is true that Sir A. Steel Maitland had regard to the interests of the commercial community, he emphasised in his Report the very general nature of the duties of Consular Officers, and framed his proposals on the basis of the whole range of the duties of a Consular Service.While dealing with the increase in the number of Consular posts since 1913/14, it may be observed that between the years 1903/04 and 1913/14 there was also an increase of 49 posts. Such continuous increase appears inevitable as new fields for British enterprise are made available.The above summary of the duties of the Consular Service has not touched on their commercial work, but it should be pointed out that the following duties of a commercial character are included in the general Consular instructions, which have been in force for many years past:  &quot;1. To furnish immediate information with regard to all important changes in local conditions affecting trade or credit.&quot; 2. To deal promptly, to the best of their ability, with questions on commercial subjects addressed to them by the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade,, or by individual British traders,
Schedule.Salaried posts which can be abolished or reduced when corresponding reductions in numbers of personnel can be effected : (a.) Consulates to be abolished, or reduced to Unsalaried status : Five: Barranquilla, Noumea, St. Pierre, Tahiti and San Juan (Porto Rico).(&amp;.) Consulates to be reduced to Vice-Consulates : Five: Vienna, Iquique, Munich, Budapest and Savannah.(c.) Vice-Consulates to be abolished, or reduced to Unsalaried status : Fourteen: Charleroi, Kasai, Leopoldville, Stanleyville, Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Ajaccio, Majunga, Toulon, Taranto, Budapest and three at Loanda.&quot;3. To prepare and keep up to date, for the use of the Board of Trade, lists of the principal dealers in various classes of goods.&quot; 4. To supply special reports from time to time on matters which appear to the Consular Officer to he of commercial interest, or which may be suggested to him by the Foreign Office.&quot; 5. To prepare an Annual Report on the trade of their district.&quot;The above shows that duties of a commercial nature have habitually been performed by the consular service.It is impossible to say how far commercial duties occupy the time of consular officers at most posts, but at certain posts, e.g., New York, Chicago, Rotterdam and Buenos Aires, special commercial departments have been set up. The annual cost of these four departments is  4,998 in all.While these special departments could be abolished if necessary, it is impossible, without reference to each individual post, to say what reduction., if any, could be made in the staff at that post, were the commercial work to be relinquished.It may, however, be affirmed that, having regard to the general duties of the consular service, the abandonment of commercial work would not necessarily lead to the closing of consular posts; it might at most lead to the reduction at larger posts of the number of clerical assistants employed, but in most cases the obligatory work alone, entailed on consular officers, would necessitate the retention of the existing staff.Very careful consideration has been given during the last year to the question of a reduction in the number of consular posts and certain posts, as shown in the attached list, have been noted for abolition, but their abolition cannot be effected until the officers holding them have retired, unless arrangements can be made for their retirement on pensionable terms before they have reached the nominal age for retirement.(Signed)        P.

STATIONERY AND PRINTING.1. The Provisional Estimates for 1922/23 compare with the corresponding expenditure in 1913/14 and with the current year&apos;s Estimates as follows : 1913/14 Audited Expenditure ...1921 /22 Net Estimates ...1922/23 Provisional Net Estimates 1,059,724 4,119,944 3,163,850In addition, supplies to Liquidation Departments are estimated at:   67,500 for 1921/22.  50,000 for 1922/23.A detailed comparison of the expenditure under each main heading is given in Appendix A.Since these figures were furnished, Revised Estimates have been put in, reducing the Net Estimated Expenditure for 1922/23 to  2,996,348 and the estimated value of supplies to Liquidation Departments to  25,000, representing a reduction in the aggregate of  192,502 per annum.The increase in this Vote represents far more than rise of prices.New items of expenditure have arisen, e.g., printing under the Representation of the People Act, 1918, estimated to cost  500,000 in 1922/23, half of which is paid by the Local Authorities, and the creation of new Departments, mainly in connection with social legislation, whose stationery requirements are from the nature of their functions and organisation much heavier than those of the older Departments.2. Staff.The increase in the number of staff employed is shown in the following table : August 1, 1914.Permanent, j Temporary.August 1, 1921.Permanent.

Government Printing Works, the formation of a Transport Section, the reprodue-tion by duplicating processes, and the stocking, issue and distribution of forms previously undertaken by the various Departments.We observe that in both the Administrative and Clerical and the Technical grades a large transfer from &quot;Temporary&quot; to &quot;Permanent&quot; is contemplated. The Department is of opinion that better results are obtained from Permanent Staff. While in no way dissenting from this view, there is obviously a time of con-traction of Government activity ahead of us, and we consider it would be more prudent to wait until a normal level of work is reached before adding to the numbers of Permanent Staff.3.

Owing to the great alterations in policy referred to, a comparison with pre-war period is quite an unprofitable one. Although this Department is engaged on commercial work, yet, unlike a commercial concern, its business is to restrict output within the smallest possible compass, and the measure of success which the Department achieves in this direction only serves to enhance the proportion which salaries and wages bear to the total expenditure.4. Carriage and Transit.1913/14 Audited Expenditure 1921/22 Estimate 1922/23 Provisional EstimateWe understand that of the total increase,  50,000 is in respect of outward freight charges, which in 1914 would have been paid by the consignees, and that the remaining  26,400 is attributable to the facts that approximately twice as much material has now to be transported at increased charge and that direct distribution is made to more than twice as many destinations as in 1914.5.

effected and we suggest that the necessary steps be taken by legislation or by Order in Council to give effect to this economy.This proposal does not interfere with the principle of a half-yearly register; if an annual register were reverted to, the total economy would be greater, but this is entirely a question of policy.7.

The Harrow works were originally purchased in 1918 for the purpose of printing the food coupons for the national scheme of food rationing. We are told that the works tender for Government orders in ordinary competition with other contractors and that their trading accounts are run on an ordinary commercial basis.The Works have been the subject of report by Select Committees of the House,-, and are being maintained for a trial period of three years dating from June 1920. In view of this we make no recommendation, but suggest that the whole question should be thoroughly reviewed before the expiration of the period, the staff being maintained on a temporary basis.We cannot think that as a general rule such enterprise by Government Depart-nients can be as economical as public tender, but such considerations as temporary rings in the market and other abnormal circumstances may otherwise justify a departure from principle. At the end of the three years trial the matter can be reviewed.8.

We have satisfied ourselves that the necessary steps are taken by the Stationery Oil ice to restrict the quantity and cost of issues, and that economy under these heads must result mainly from a reduction in the requirements of Departments, or from a fall in the price of materials or wages.9. Summary.The considerable increase in the cost of this Department reflects not only the increase in prices and wages, but also the growth in Departments and Departmental activities since 1913/14; and any restriction of those activities should involve a direct reduction in the corresponding subheads of this Estimate.The difficulty of the Stationery Office is to check extravagant demands effectually. A good deal&quot; is done in this direction, and we have examined in detail a number of instances given to us where objections raised by the Stationery Office have resulted in economy.Further economies might, we think, be realised if the various forms and returns in all Departments were thoroughly overhauled with a view to standardisation and simplification, and such an examination will, we feel confident, frequently show that the purpose for which the form or return was instituted no longer remains.Having regard to the recommendations we have made in this and in earlier Reports, we think that the revised Estimates for the Stationery Office should be susceptible of a further reduction during 1922/23 of approximately  150,000 in addition to the  85,000 which might be saved in connection with printing under the Representation of the People Act.CONCLUSIONS.As a result of our consideration, we are of opinion: (1.) That the restrictions on the activities of various Departments suggested in our Reports should lead to a further reduction in the Estimates for the Stationery Office approximating in 1922/23 to  150,000.(2.) That a modification of the procedure under the Representation of People Act, 1918, should, whilst retaining the principle of a half-yearly register, lead to a saving in expenditure on printing of  85,000.(3.) That the Estimate for the Department for 1922/23 should be fixed at  2,761,348, a reduction below the Provisional Estimate of  402,502, and the amount for supplies to Liquidation Departments at  25,000 instead of  50,000 shown in the Provisional Estimates, a total reduction of  427,502.

Functions of the Registrar-General.There are three classes of duties now undertaken by the Registrar-Gcnerafs Office which did not obtain in 1913/14 :-1. The purely temporary work involved by the preparation of the report on the results of the 1921 Census will shortly reach its maximum and will remain heavy during 1922/23. The work in connection with the 1911 Census was practically complete before the financial year 1913/14.2. A large amount of verification work is now undertaken on behalf of the Ministry of Pensions and the Service Departments and arises out of the war.3. Certain new administrative work in connection with Electoral Registration.The chief normal function of the Registrar-General is in connection with registration and statistics of births, marriages and deaths. This registration is carried on outside the Head Office by three separate sets of statutory Registrars, viz., Registrars of Births and Deaths, Superintendent Registrars, and Registrars of Marriages. Of these, the first two classes are appointed by the Guardians, and the Registrars of Marriages are appointed either by the Superintendent Registrars or by the Registrar-General. In all three cases, the appointments are held during the pleasure of the Registrar-General.The system is an antiquated one and indeed, its connection with Poor Law dates back to 1836. There is no organic connection between the Registration Service and the Poor Law, but the Poor Law system was, at that time, the only existing system of ubiquitous local administration and the Registration Service was tacked on to it for convenience.The Registrars are paid in a variety of ways, contributions being made by the Guardians and the Exchequer to supplement their proceeds from fees. The total cost of the Registration Service amounts to approximately  440,000 per annum. Of this amount,  120,000 is paid out of the Poor Rate,  30,000 out of the Exchequer, and the fees paid by the public account for  290,000. These figures are exclusive of the cost of the Head Office. It will be seen, therefore, that the revenue, apart from&apos;Head Office, fails to meet the cost of registration by  150,000 per annum, and this is not surprising, seeing that the ordinary statutory fees payable by the public were fixed in 1836, and none of them has since been increased.We understand that the Registrar-General has in preparation a scheme for reorganising the Registration Service to synchronise with a revision of the fees charged to the public. This reorganisation and revision of fees has the object of relieving the rates and the Exchequer of the burden which at present falls upon them and of effecting economies in the case both of this Registration Service and the Electoral Registration Service, and, at the same time, it aims at providing a more elastic and cheaper system of machinery for future Census purposes.     We
understand that this reorganisation and the revision of the fees require to be put into force simultaneously, and that some little time must elapse before it can be effected, but we recommend that it should be given very full consideration in view of the economies which it promises.3. Fee Income of the General Register Office.As regards fee income of the General Register Office itself at Headquarters, it is estimated that at the existing scale of fees it should amount to  18,000 in 1922/23. One-third, roughly, of this sum is derived from searches and two-thirds from certificates. The proposals of the Registrar-General to which we have referred above contemplate an increase of this scale, which should raise the fee revenue to  34,000. It is not, however, considered desirable to introduce this revised scale at Headquarters until the reorganisation of the staff and the revision of the fees in the provinces have been effected. Such a step would merely divert the business from Headquarters to the local Superintendent Registrars. There is, however, one particular piece of work of the Head Office in respect of which an increased fee could be contemplated immediately, i.e., in connection with applications for certificates by post. This work involves a search of records by the staff in addition to the issue of a certificate. The present charge is only Is., which is the same as is charged for a search made by a member of the public in person. We therefore recommend that this fee should be increased from Is. to 2s 6c/., in order to make the work of the postal search-room more self-supporting. The increase in the Appropriations-in-Aid resulting therefrom is estimated at  3,600 annually.CONCLUSIONS.We are of opinion that: (1.) The organisation of the Registration Service and the present scale of fees should be revised, so that the whole Service may be self-supporting, with an ultimate saving of  150,000 to the Exchequer and local rates.(2.) That the fees for postal searches should be increased so as to produce an additional revenue of  3,600.(3.) That the Provisional Estimate should accordingly be reduced to  162,048, a saving of  3,600.

This has since been reduced by more than  2,000.As regards the normal work of the Registrar-General&apos;s Office, Scotland, in connection with the registration of births, marriages and deaths, we suggest that full consideration should be given to the scheme for the reorganisation of the service and the revision of fees, as we have described in our Report on the Registrar-Generals Office, England.We make no recommendation on this Vote other than that, as in the case of England, the fee for postal search should be increased from Is. to 2s.

Provisional EstimateThis Vote is to provide for the payment to the Councils of Counties and Boroughs of one half of the sums paid by these Councils for Registration expenses under the Representation of the People Act, 1918. In 1913/14 there was no similar Vote, but the Vote for Miscellaneous Legal Expenses included, in respect of the Revising Barristers (England), a sum of  25,462, of which one-half was recoverable as an Appropriation-! n-Aid.Persons Employed.Up to 1918, election expenses were borne by the local authorities and the candidates, except as regards the Revising Barristers mentioned above. On the 1st August, 1921, there were six temporary officers employed in the Treasury County Courts Department. On the 1st April, 1922, the position will be the same, with a proviso that, in the event of a General Election, a temporary increase of twenty-four would be required.Cost of Electoral Registration.Under the Representation of the People Act, 1918, it is provided that two Registers of Electors are to be prepared every year by the Registration Officers, and there is a Registration Officer for each area. Any expenses properly incurred by the Registration Officer in this work, including his own remuneration, are paid by the Council, and one-half of the Registration expenses so paid is repaid to the Council out of this Vote. The sum of  350,000 contained in this Estimate represents what is anticipated to be half the cost of the Registration Officers for the year in connection with the preparation of the two Registers which are required each year. If it were decided that one annual Register, instead of two, would suffice, it is estimated that there would be a saving of less than half of this Vote. This, however, raises a question of policy on which we express no opinion. In addition to the saving on this Vote, there would be a saving on the Vote for the Stationery Office, which, for the current year, shows an item of  700,000 for printing and paper required for Voters&apos; Lists and Registers. Half of this sum is recoverable from local authorities. We have dealt with this point on the Stationery Office Vote.

PETERHEAD HAR.BOUIt. Class I (12).1. This Vote is in respect of the construction of the Harbour of Refuge &quot;at Peter-head. The following table gives a comparison of the expenditure of 1913/14 and the Estimates for 1921/22 and 1922/23 :-Audited --                       Expenditure 1913/14.		Estimate 1921/22.

The Committee reported in favour of the construction of this Harbour at an estimated cost of  250,000, exclusive of the cost of housing and maintaining the convicts. Work was commenced in 1885 on a scheme estimated to cost  737,000, and has proceeded, with a short interval during the war, ever since. In 1903, the Treasury agreed to provide  32,000 per annum, so as to expedite the work and to complete it, as was then thought, in eighteen years, i.e., by 1921.2. Financial Position.Up to the 31st March, 1921, rather less than  1 million had been voted for this scheme by annual instalments, and  900.000&apos; had actually been spent. It will be seen, therefore, that the estimate for the whole work has already been considerably exceeded though the work is far from being completed. An estimate has been supplied to us showing that the total cost of this work is provisionally estimated at  1,592,147. Of this amount,  907,000 had been spent up to the 31st March, 1921. If the annual Votes are to continue to be at the rate of  25,000 now proposed, the work will not be completed for another twenty-six years.There are three alternatives : 1. To slow down the work and only do maintenance of what has already been constructed. 2. To abandon the work.3. To continue the work on the present scheme, or a modified scheme.As regards (1)- -slowing down the work the Treasury in September 1921 raised this specific point in view of the present financial circumstances. The suggestion is opposed by all parties.It is urged that the Harbour of Refuge will be of utility when completed; that there are no other means of employing the convicts so suitably; that the policy of slowing down would cost  14,000 a year quite unprofitably; that the present incomplete state of the breakwaters makes the Harbour dangerous, and that the local labour engaged on the work, in addition to the convicts, would lose its employment.The arguments against slowing down apply also to alternative (2) above, viz., the abandonment of the scheme, which would mean the sacrifice of nearly  1 million in wages and material and the results of thirty-seven years&apos; work, and in the end the Harbour would be in a worse condition than before.
We are therefore driven to consider alternative (3)-to continue the work.The Consulting Engineers hope to make an average surface progress of 80 to 100 ft. of breakwater, both in the current and the forthcoming financial years, though much depends on sea conditions and the cost of material. The completion of the northern breakwater is the only capital work remaining to be clone.We are far from being satisfied that the Harbour is really required. During the war, the Harbour was used by a considerable number of Naval vessels and others owing to the exceptional conditions in the North Sea, but we are informed that, at the present time, it is only used as a Harbour of Refuge by trawlers, drifters and other fishing craft and small sailing vessels proceeding coastwise, but even so, during a storm, the number does not exceed ten, and from the information before us we are of opinion that these works are likely to be of small national importance even though they ultimately formed a good Harbour of Refuge for fishing vessels. It will have taken sixty-three years to build (at the present rate of annual instalment), and will have cost twice the amount estimated in 1885. The position seems to us to be unsatisfactory, and while we do not suggest the abandonment of the work, after so much money and labour has been expended on it, or the restriction of the work to mere maintenance (at a cost of  14,000 a year without any return), we strongly recommend that this subject should be at once examined with a view to seeing whether some modification of the plans cannot be introduced which will shorten the work and decrease the outstanding liability of  653,000. We are of opinion that a total sum of  lij million is a big price to pay in order to provide suitable employment for convicts. Meanwhile, until a decision is arrived at by the Government as to possible modification of the plans, we feel that there is no alternative to recommend-ing that a provision of  25,000 should be allowed for 1922/23. It will be observed that the revised Estimate gives a saving of  600 on the Provisional Estimate of July last.

This Vote represents the non-effective benefits paid to all Civil Servants, except employees of the Fighting Services Departments and the Revenue Departments, whose non-effective allowances, although granted in accordance with the Civil Superannuation Acts, are borne upon the Votes of the individual Departments, as shown in the following table : Table of Civil Superannuation Cost in Fighting Service Departments and revenue Departments.Army Superannuation Injuries, &amp;c...Navy Superannuation Injuries, &amp;c. ..Air Force  Superannuation Injuries, &amp;c. ..Customs and Excise:):Inland Revenue^Post Office-Superannuation Injuries, &amp;c...A udited Expenditure 1913/14 (including Expenditure under Workmen&apos;s Com-pensation Act). 137,463 392,223488,477 130,805989,348(Estimate, 1921/22. 186,800 65,500636,200 180,5005,384 11,150 905,000 330,000f 222,0002,275,700 15,000Provisional Estimate, 1922/23. 186,800 65,500884,200*5,384 11,150730,000265,0002,195,700 15,000*  88,800 of this is for injuries, &amp;c. t Probable Supplementary.I The payments for injuries, &amp;c, in these Departments are negligible,
Adding the foregoing table to the amount of the Vote as set out at the head of this Chapter, we find that the total figures of expenditure upon Civil Superannua-tion and Injury Grants are as follows : Audited Expenditure, 1918/14.

Calculation of Bonus in Assessing Pension.Bonus was first made pensionable in part in connection with the Civil Service Arbitration Board Award of March 1919 Subsequent agreements endorsed the principle and the present arrangement under which 75 per cent, of the bonus received at the date of retirement reckons as an emolument for pension purposes, was embodied in the Civil Service Whitley Council Cost of Living Agreement, dated the 8th May, 1920.It has been explained to us that this decision as to the calculation of bonus for pension purposes was only arrived at after very careful consideration of various alternatives, all of which were open to strong objection.Since the above decision was arrived at, difficulty in the administration of the arrangement has been caused by the unexpectedly rapid fall in the average cost of living figure for the six months ending the 31st August, 1921, which, together with the super-cut for the higher salaries, brought about a situation in which there was a very marked difference in the Superannuation Allowances as between officers retiring just before or just after the 1st September, 1921. The sudden drop in bonus on the 1st September, 1921, gave a strong inducement to Civil Servants eligible to retire before the! 1st September to do so. A table showing the retirements in each of the five quarters to the 30th September, 1921, is appended to this Report (Appendix (A)). This state of affairs coincided, however, with reorganisations and retrenchments, and. Heads of Departments were able to avail themselves of the readiness of older Civil Servants, or of those whose health was such, as to interfere with the efficient discharge of their duties, to retire and so facilitate plans for the reduction of staff. We are informed that, in the opinion of the Treasury, both economy and greater efficiency have been obtained by these changes.The increases in this Vote are due to the following factors : 1. The progressive increase in past years in the pensionable establishments of the Civil Service.2. Increased rate of pension and additional allowances due to the admission of75 per cent, bonus        pensionable emolument. 3. An increase in the number of pensioners due to the exceptional number ofretirements prior to the 1st September, 1921, explained above. 4. The increases in certain pre-war pensions under the provisions of thePensions (Increase) Act, 1920.4. Injury Grants.It will be seen from the table at the head of this Report that Sub-Head E &apos; Injury Grants-has increased from  2,252 in 1913/14 to  10,000 in 1922/23. These payments are governed by the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts and similar Statutory provisions.CONCLUSION.We do not consider it possible to recommend any course which is likely to lead to a reduction of the amount necessary for these Services. It is inevitable that the growth of the Civil Service should be reflected in the Superannuation Vote for many years to come. It will be observed, as we have stated at the outset of our Report, that the Provisional Estimate for 1922/23 of  1,280,250 has since been increased to  1,452,472, an increase of  172,222.

MERCHANT SEAMEN&apos;S WAR PENSIONSClass VI (4).1921/22 Estimate1922/23 Provisional Estimate 595,485 534,600A revised Estimate has since been furnished amounting to  537,391.Under schemes initiated in connection with the Marine War Risks Insurance Schemes, the Government undertook to pay compensation, including pensions to widows and allowances to children, in the case of Merchant Seamen who lost their lives or were injured on British Merchant Ships and Fishing Vessels through War perils. Up to the 31st March, 1921, payments were made from the War Risks Insurance Fund, and on the winding-up of the Fund, provision requires to be made from Votes. The benefits conform generally with those of the Pensions Warrants, and the present basis of awards will be subject to revision in common with pensions under those Warrants in 4923. The capitalised value of the pensions and allowances at present being paid is about  8,250,000.The number of staff engaged in administering the pensions is estimated at 29 on the 1st April next as compared with 32 on the 1st August, 1921.This Service is a liability arising out of the War, and we make no recommendation.[7802]P

A similar sum appeared in the Estimates for 1921/22. We understand that this Association was formed in 1911 for the purpose of facilitating the exchange of information and visits and to provide a ready means of intercourse between Members of the different Parliaments of the Empire. Its Headquarters are at the House of Lords, where all information connected with Dominion Parliamentary and public affairs is collected and made available for Home and Dominion purposes.Financial Position.In the year 1919/20, the Association first asked for a Grant-in-Aid. Their working expenses were calculated to be as follows : In 1919 and in subsequent years, the House of Commons voted  5,000 as a Grant-in-Aid, which thus covers the working expenses of the Association. We understand that voluntary subscriptions only amount to some  400 a year and are allocated to hospitality purposes. We are informed that the Treasury have recently reviewed this grant and propose that, in 1922/23, it should be reduced by 20 per cent, to  4,000.There will therefore be a saving of  1.000. in addition to the  9,074 by which the Provisional Estimate has been reduced in the Revised Estimate.rees to writers   ...

Its object is to encourage saving by offering special facilities to the small investor in Government Securities, and it aims at fostering a habit of saving which grew up during the war under the War Savings movement. Its usefulness has been strongly emphasised by two expert and authoritative Committees and its record in the form of sales of Savings Certificates is shown in the table attached (Appendix (A)).Staff.The following table shows the number employed at Headquarters : August 1, 1921.   April 1, 1922.(a.) Permanent       ... ... 40 52(6.) Temporary       ... ... 228 152268        -  204Of the staff of 268 in August 1921, only 40 held permanent posts, and of these 32 are pensionable. The staff position has been carefully watched in order that the numbers might always be kept in strict proportion to the volume of business, and as a result of a recent review, it was expected that, by the beginning of 1922/23, the staff will have been reduced to 204.Apart from the Headquarters staff, the work throughout the country has been carried out by a large body of voluntary workers, numbering over 200,000, who carry on the work of 1,700 Local Committees and 25,000 Associations or Savings Clubs. Further new Associations are being formed at an average rate of 90 per month among Factories, Works, Schools and social organisations.CONCLUSION.We are of opinion that this system and organisation brings in real savings very largely contributed from sources hitherto untapped and that it encourages thrift. In these circumstances, we recommend the continuance of the organisation provided that the Headquarters staff is constantly kept under review. We assume that the sum of  2,000 included for the expenses of Local Committees in Ireland will be removed from the Vote for 1922/23.[7802]* Includes  2,000 for Ireland.

The Commission is an Imperial body established under. Royal Charter with the duty of constructing and maintaining the graves of Imperial Service personnel who fell in the Great War, numbering some 600,000. It is financed jointly by the British and Dominion Governments in proportion to the number of graves for which each would ordinarily be responsible.Apart from the cost of a small staff (4 in number) and of the acquisition of sites in this country which is a purely United Kingdom charge, the Vote is required to provide the British share, provisionally fixed at 81-52 per cent, of the common expenditure. This share is given in the form of a Grant-in-Aid which, when voted, is paid into the common fund and is not subject to Treasury control, although the Treasury is represented on the Commission^ Finance Committee. Any unexpended balance at the end of the year is carried forward or applied to reduce the Grant-in-Aid for the following year.The original Estimates of common expenditure were as follows :   1920/21        ... ... ... ...      2,787,0001921/22        ... ... ... ...      2,366,7201922/23        ... ... ...      &apos;   ...      2,316,0002.

The work of the Commission has not yet reached its maximum activity and we are informed that owing to unavoidable delays the rate of progress has been much slower than was anticipated, and that falling prices and economies have enabled the average contract cost per grave to be reduced from  10 to  7 10$. The actual common expenditure for 1920/21 was  965.000 only, and the revised estimates of common expenditure recently furnished for the subsequent two years are :-  1921/22        ... ... ... ...      1,441,1131922/23        ... ... ... ...      1,863,000As a result a balance of  1,079,000 is estimated to be carried forward on the 31st March next and the Commission have further agreed, on the representation of the Treasury, that the expenditure in 1922/23 should be limited to  1,750,000. These alterations will reduce the sum required from the Exchequer next year to  356,701.
We have not examined the common expenditure in detail, but we would point out that it materially concerns the United Kingdom Taxpayer who contributes 81-5 per cent, of the total. We are assured that the arrangements for consultation between the Commission and the Treasury are considered to be satisfactory.We do not suggest any alteration in the reduced Estimate of  356,641 now proposed, which represents a reduction of  1,050,391 upon the Provisional Estimate.
IllNATIONAL INSURANCE AUDIT DEPARTMENT.Class VII (7).The following table shows a comparison of the expenditure for 1913/14 and the Estimates for 1921/22 and 1922/23 :-Sub-Heads.

Permanent (&amp;.) TemporaryAugust 1, 1914.544 236780August 1, 1921.482* 17499April 1, 1922. 497*497The decrease of staff since August 1914 from 780 to 497 is almost entirely due to the completion of the initial work of organising the Approved Societies. That work involved the engagement of a large amount of clerical assistance at low rates of pay and the reduction in numbers is therefore not reflected proportionately in the cost.The numbers of staff for the year 1922/23 are those which the Treasury are satisfied are required for the work of full audit in a normal year, including the work for the quinquennial valuations. We are assured that any modification of the audit would involve more loss of efficiency in the accounts of the Approved Societies than it would mean saving on the reduced Audit staff. We think that this staff should be kept constantly under review. An amalgamation of small Societies would result in a decrease in the number of audits and a saving in staff.We are of opinion that the cost of this audit should be borne by the Approved Societies and should be charged as an &quot; administrative expense &quot; towards which the State would contribute its ordinary proportion of 2/9ths. The State contribution would thus be about  40,000 for 1922/23, a saving of approximately  140,000.* Includes 11 officers lent to other Departments.
* &apos;    ROAD FUND.*This Fund is not an ordinary Supply Service. Prior to the establishment of the Ministry of Transport the Road Fund was administered by the Road Board, and was financed by assigned revenues derived from the Motor Spirit and Carriage Licence Duties. These revenues were withdrawn during the war. In 1920/21 the Fund was again assigned the revenues of the Motor Spirit and Carriage Licence Duties during the first nine months of the year, after which the net proceeds of the new tax qji mechanically propelled vehicles has- been paid into the Fund in accordance with provisions in the Roads Act, 1920.The amount of the net receipts of the Road Fund from taxation available for expenditure on road works during the last two years is estimated as under:  Year ended. December 31, 1921 .... ....   -     ....      8,450,000Year ended December 31, 1922 .... .... ....      8,388,000The purpose of the Fund is to make grants and loans to Highway Authorities throughout the country in aid of the expenditure incurred by them in the construction, maintenance and improvement of roads and bridges. For the purpose of enabling the contributions towards maintenance to be equtably distributed the roads of the country have been classified, and during the lasit year 50 per cent, of the approved expenditure on maintenance of Class I, roads was borne by the Exchequer, and 25 per cent, of the expenditure on Class II, roads. Nothing is given to other roads.We find that in every case where grants have been made a definite limit of money has been fixed by the Ministry of Transport, so that in no case has the State incurred an unlimited liability.The assignment to road purposes of the proceeds of motor taxes was in the nature of a bargain with motor users, and while this bargain stands we do not feel that we can make any recommendation.* Note. With your approval the Chairman of the Committee took no part in the consideration of this subject or in framing the above report in. view of the fact that he himself was the Minister of Transport.

A sum of  138,000 is the estimated extra receipts payable to the Exchequer in 1922/23 in connection with this Service,  The expenditure is divided as follows : 1921/22. 1922/23. &apos;  Salaries and Expenses of Central Staff       22,040 6,435 Acquisition of Licensed Premises and Additions and Improvements (CapitalExpenditure)      ...         ...         ...      150,000 153,500The cost of actually conducting the business on the spot is charged to the Trading Account.2. During the war the State undertook the direct control of the Liquor Traffic in four areas Carlisle, Gretna, Cromarty Firth and Enfield Lock with the object of maintaining the greatest possible efficiency of the munition workers in those areas. The retail sale of intoxicating liquor was taken over, full compensation being paid to the trade, so that within the areas there is now a virtual State monopoly of the retail liquor traffic. In the Carlisle area breweries have also been taken over. The administration was originally carried on hy the Liquor Control Board. On the termination of the Board its functions have been transferred under the Licensing Act, 1921, to the Home Office and Scottish Office acting jointly.We have been furnished with a statement of the assets and liabilities of the whole undertaking as at the 31st March, 1921, together with a Profit and Loss Account, from which it appears that the total capital employed was approximately  1,270,000, of which over  1,000,000 represents capital assets, and that during the year 1921 a profit of about  138,000 was made. The total profit made during the period from the 1st April, 1918, to the 31st March, 1921, one mainly of good trade, amounts to  464,000, representing approximately 12-1 per cent, on the average capital employed during that period. This profit is arrived at before making provision for interest on capital provided by the Exchequer, Excess Profits Duty and Income Tax which would have been payable by a private firm.3. The original object for which this trading operation was undertaken no longer exists and there does not appear to be any reason for its continuance as a State undertaking, except for the purpose of making an experiment in the direct administration of the liquor traffic. We are informed that the scheme is not intended to be primarily profit making, but that its present as well as its original aim is the provision of food and drink under model conditions.The Licensing Act, 1921, provides, that if the Secretary of State or the Secretary for Scotland is satisfied that any property vested in him by the Act is no longer required, he may sell or otherwise dispose of it in such manner as he may think fit. That Act also provides that until Parliament otherwise determines, the existing State Management Schemes mav be continued. The Home Office state that, subject to further consideration as regards the Enfield Lock area, which does not appear to be profitable, it is intended to continue all the existing Schemes.We do not enter into the political or social reasons for this experiment, but in view of the results so far obtained and of the risk of loss in future years its con-tinuance as a State undertaking would not appear likely to afford any special financial advantage to the Taxpayer.4. We observe that the Estimate includes a provision of  153,500 for the acquisition of Licensed Premises as well as capital additions and improvements. Of this amount  53.500 is for compensation and adaptation in connection with premises already acquired and  100.000 to acquire further premises. We understand that the object of the proposed purchases is to complete the State monopoly in the Carlisle area, but we do not think that in present financial circumstances any further expenditure of this kind should be incurred.[7802] Q
PART XVII.AFTERMATH OF THE WAR SERVICES.Introductory Remarks.In this part of our Report we deal with the following Aftermath Services in respect of which there was no corresponding expenditure in 1913/14 : Disposal and Liquidation Commission (formerly Ministry of Munitions). Shipping Liquidation (formerly Ministry of Shipping). Railway and Canal Agreements. Treasury Securities Deposit Scheme. Coal Mines Deficiency.The expenditure under these five Votes, estimated to amount in 1922/23 to  44,000,000, forms part of the special expenditure to be set against Special Revenues in the Budget.In our second Interim Report we suggested that it might be desirable to remove from the Trade Departments the work of an Aftermath nature now performed by them, and to group it together with the work of the Disposal and Liquidation Commission in a single Department. By this means the permanent Departments would be put upon a normal permanent basis of expenditure, and the work and cost of liquidation would be readily controlled and kept prominently under review. Theoretically we think that this would be desirable. We append at the end of this Part a Memorandum (Appendix (A) ) furnished by the Treasury analysing the Aftermath Services referred to in our second Interim Report on Trade Services. While we recognise that the matter is mainly one of administration, and that there may be administrative difficulties in the way of altering,existing arrangements, we are of opinion that it would be desirable for the reasons already stated, if these services could be grouped together under a single Minister, so far as such a course may be administratively practicable and economical, and we recommend that the Government should consider such an arrangement, with consequent modification of the Votes concerned to which we have not given effect.We proceed to deal, seriatim, with the Estimates set out in the table above.
115 Chapter I.DISPOSAL AND LIQUIDATION COMMISSION. (Formerly Ministry of Munitions.)1920/ 21 Net Estimates 1921/22 Net Estimates 1922/23 Estimates-GrossNet      ............Reduction in 1922/23 as compared with 1921/22 18,336,000 7,600,0005,900,000 4,500,0001.

Disposal Expenditure.Apart from a liquidation staff, now numbering forty-seven and costing  20,000 in 1922/23, the provision for salaries and wages is for the staff engaged under the Disposal Board.  The numbers are as follows: September 1921. April 1922.Headquarters   ... ... 1,550 1,200Ex-Headquarters ... 4,750 5,060(4,200 industrial]     (4,500 industrial).The Disposal Board is engaged in the sale of Government property declared to be surplus since the Armistice, and its functions and policy have been fully described in papers presented to Parliament in 1920 and 1921 (Cmd. Papers 850 and 1412). The total sales effected from the date of the Armistice to the 30th June, 1921, amount to  582,000,000, and although the depression of trade has seriously retarded the progress of the work and has made it difficult in many cases to cany out previous contracts, ordinary weekly sales by auction, tender and private treaty, are even now realising on the average  350,000 per week. Surplus stores are still being notified to the Disposal Board of an average value of about  300,000 per week, and it is now estimated by the Commission that the receipts in 1922/23 may amount to  35,000,000. The surplus stocks for disposal will be appreciably increased if the recommendations made in our first Interim Report upon the Fighting Services are adopted by the Government.Apart from ordinary current sales, block sales have been effected by the Board of motor transport, textiles, ferrous materials, brass scrap, chemicals and explosives.We are not in a position to criticise the organisation and expenditure of the Board in detail. We think that block sales of the property remaining for disposal should be effected wherever such a course appears to be possible and economical. It is however, desirable that the work of valuing and selling all the stores in the hands of the Board should be pressed on as rapidly as possible during 1922/23 so far as market conditions permit. The Statutory existence of the Disposal and Liquidation Commission terminates on the 31st March, 1924, and we recommend that the Govern-ment should consider the fixing of a date in 1922/23 after which no further stores should be notified by Departments to the Disposal Board, and pre-war methods of disposal restored, so that it may be possible to wind up this Department finally within the prescribed period.3. Liquidation Liabilities.The provision of  2,462,000 is for the purpose of completing the settlement of the war contracts of the Ministry of Munitions.   During the period from the [7802] Q 2I
1st April to the 31st December, 1921, the number of outstanding accounts has been reduced from 1,247 to 478, and we are informed that a considerable amount of preliminary work has been done upon the remaining Accounts, and that it is hoped to complete it during 1922/23.The money provision to be made can .only be estimated conjecturally as the expenditure will depend to a considerable extent upon the result of negotiations, with Contractors and litigation. It is expected that towards the gross expenditure shown above, receipts amounting to  1,400,000 will be obtained in respect of the repayment of advances made by the Ministry of Munitions to Contractors during the War and interest thereon.We make no recommendation.
SHIPPING LIQUIDATION.(Formerly Ministry1920/21 1921/22 1922/23Reduction of expenditure in 1922/23 compared with 1921/221.

We are informed that the work remaining to be completed is : 1. The examination and settlement of Accounts with Allied and Dominion Governments and Shipping Companies, including certain cases in which arbitration proceedings or litigation are pending.2. The collection of instalments due on the purchase of vessels.3. The general closing of Accounts and their presentation to parliament on the termination of the Ministry of Shipping and the Office of the Shipping Controller under the Ministries of Munitions and Shipping (Termination) Act, 1921, the Department was placed as regards Ministerial control and responsibility to Parliament under the Board of Trade. The actual administration is conducted with the assistance of an Advisory Committee consisting of,the late Shipping Controller and other Shipowners formerly associated with the Ministry.3. Liquidation Expenses in respect of Requisitioned and other Vessels:  5,655,000.Included in this item is a sum of  258,000 on account of the current expenses in respect of certain Prize and Detained vessels not yet disposed of. The balance is required to discharge the liabilities of the Department to Shipping Companies and others for the running expenses, repairs and reconditioning of vessels now sold or released. The precise amount required is somewhat conjectural as the payments to be made depend on the rendering of Accounts by the firms concerned, and the settlement of the State liability in disputed cases.
4. Liquidation Expenses in respect of Shipbuilding and Shipyard Schemes:  65,000.This item represents the clearing up of outstanding liabilities in connection with the Standard Shipbuilding Programme and Shipyard Schemes undertaken by the Government during the war.5. Miscellaneous Expenses:  26,000.This amount represents provision for losses on exchange, the winding-up of Offices abroad, and other contingencies.6. Extra Receipts:  2,811,000.These receipts, which will be paid direct to the Exchequer, are the amounts due to the Government, which are expected to be received during 1922/23, in respect of the sales of vessels already made;and payments by Allied and Dominion GovernmentsWe are informed that the work of the Department will not be finally completed by the 31st March, 1923, but that after that date it is anticipated that further expenditure amounting to  2,000,000 will be incurred, and receipts obtained of  6,000,000.We have not investigated the staff in detail. The cost appears to be small in relation to the turnover, and we make no recommendation.
119 Chapter III.RAILWAY AND CANAL AGREEMENTS.Mil1920/21 Estimate   ... ... ... ...       45,400,0001921/22 Estimate    ... ... ... ...       75,000,0001922/23 Provisional Estimate ... ...       31,510,000Reduction in 1922/23 as compared with 1921/22       43,490,000This expenditure represents the Liquidation of Liabilities under Agreements relating to war-time control of Railways and Canals in Great Britain and Ireland.The cost of administration is included in the Ministry of Transport Vote, and is not capable of exact ascertainment. An estimate, however, places the cost, including rent, postage, &amp;c, at  23,690 for 1922/23.The sum of  31,510,000 included in the Estimate for 1922/23 is made up as follows :  Second moiety of lump sum payment to Railway Companies in Great Britain, under Section 11 of Railways Act, 1921   ... ... ... ...      30,000,000Second moiety of lump sum payment to Railway Companies in Ireland, under Irish Railways (Settle-ment of Claims) Act, 1921      ... ...       1,500,000Provision against certain remanet payments ... ... 10,00031,510,000The lump sum payments, provided for under the statutes mentioned, were in discharge of liabilities arising at the termination of control. The Government remains liable for that part of the compensation which under the agreements and arrangements entered into during the war was payable currently during the control periodPayments on account of this liability have been made, throughout the period of control, on the basis of monthly estimates submitted by the Companies. These provisional payments on account are subject to adjustment on audit, and the Ministry of Transport is still engaged on the detailed investigation of the claims which must precede a final settlement of the Governments liability. The claims are in various stages of investigation, and many claims have not yet been compiled by the Companies concerned in a form suitable for audit. While the bulk of the Govern-ment&apos;s cash liability has probably been liquidated by provisional payments made on the basis of estimates furnished by the Companies, the necessity remains of completing the investigation and audit of the Companies&apos; substantive claims before final settlement can be reached.The cost of the staff is small compared to the money involved.We can make no recommendation with regard to this Vote other than the general recommendation as to combining the liquidation of claims of this nature. We consider that this service should be transferred either to the Liquidation Department or to the Treasury.
TREASURY SECURITIES DEPOSIT SCHEME. 1920/21 Estimate 1921/22 Estimate 1922/23 Provisional Estimate ... Reduction in 1922/23 as compared with1,578,500 889,137 38,6001921/22850,537This Vote arises out of arrangements made during the war whereby certain securities were borrowed from English holders and pledged in America as collateral for loans raised there. Under the scheme all securities borrowed were to be returned by the 31st March, 1922, and we understand that this is being effected.Owners of securities so borrowed received by way of consideration additional interest at the rate of \ per cent, per annum. The Estimate for 1922/23 provides for a small remanet for paying this additional interest in cases in which dividend warrants cannot be cleared until after the 31st March next, together with a small provision for the payment of sums due to agents.&quot;We understand that this office will close during the early part of 1922/23, and in the circumstances we make no recommendation.
COAL 1VJMINES DEFICIENCY1920/21 Estimate 1921/22 Estimate 1922/23 Provisional Estimate Increase in 1922/23 as compared with 15,000,000 3.000,000 5.000,0001921/222,000,000This expenditure arises out of arrangements made by the Government under Statute for the control of the Coal Mines during and after the Avar. The provision required for 1922/23 consists of two items.The first, amounting to  3,000,000, is for recoupment to Mine-owners of sums due to them under the Coal Mines Control Agreement (Confirmation) Act, 1918, in respect of their guaranteed standards during the period ended the 31st March, 1919. The estimated expenditure under this Act up to the 31st March, 1922, is  4,900,000, and besides the sum now asked for a further  1,000,000 may be required after 1922/23. The Taxpayer also provided  6,300,000 on account of increased wages under the Sankey Award in the period ended the 31st March, 1919, so that the total expenditure in respect of that period may amount to  15,200,000.The second item, amounting to  2,000,000, is for advances to keep the Coal Mines Emergency Act Account in funds. This account, which was established by the Emergency Act of 1920 as from the 1st April, 1919, receives Coal Levy (excess profits) and distributes to Mines, which during the period of control have failed to earn their standard profits, sums to meet the deficiency. These deficiencies were increased during the latter months of control by the depression of trade, and, owing to the same cause and to the Coal Dispute, the receipts from Coal Levy have fallen short of expectations and have been delayed. It has been, and still remains, necessary, therefore, for the Exchequer, under the Act, to place the account in funds to meet the Statutory payments, and the advances already made for this purpose and to be made in 1922/23 will amount to a total of  26,000,000.As against this expenditure a sum of  1,000,000 has been recovered, and it is expected that a further  6,000,000 will be repaid to the Exchequer in 1922/23 or subsequently.The net cost to the Taxpayer of the statutory control of the Coal Mines may therefore be put at  34,200,000, apart from the subvention costing  7,100,000 granted upon the termination of the Coal Dispute.The expenditure provided in the Estimates for 1922/23 is determined by Statute, and we make no recommendation.Memorandum: by the Treasury on certain Aftermath Services.The Aftermath Services, other than the Disposal and Liquidation Commission, mentioned in the Interim Report on Trade Services, may be analysed as follows : The only Service of this nature which will remain in 1922/23 under the Board of Trade is the Timber Supplies Department. It would no doubt be possible to transfer the actual disposal of the small remaining stocks to the Disposal Board, but the Board of Trade must presumably continue to be responsible to the Public Accounts Committee for the Trading Account, and the change would, therefore, in addition to the disturbance of continuity, lead to some increase of interdepartmental correspondence. The remainder of the work of the Department, dealing with the liquidation of claims, &amp;c, could hardly be transferred without serious loss of experience. The general administration of Timber Supply Services has suffered in the past from being in the hands of four Departments successively.APPENDIX (A).(1.) Disposal of Surplus War Property.[7802]R
(2.) The Winding-upof Accounts.(a.) Shipping Liquidation.This is a self-contained Department with a separate Vote, and the question is, therefore, mainly one of Ministerial control and responsibility to Parliament. As regards actual administration, the Department receives most valuable help from an Advisory Committee, consisting of the late Shipping Controller and other Shipowners formerly associated with the Ministry of Shipping. On the termination of the Ministry and the Office of the Shipping Controller under the Ministries of Munitions and Shipping (Termination) Act, 1921, Parliamentary responsibility was transferred to the Board of Trade, and it is not considered desirable to disturb this arrangement. The Avork will continue for about two years.(b.) Liquidation of the Coal Mines (Confirmation) Act Account and the Coal Mines Emergency Act Account.This work is now being done by a staff of about 70 in the Mines Department, and no reduction will be possible before the end of 1922/23. It is possible that on the termination of the separate Mines Department, this staff might be transferred to the Liquidation Board, if it can be separated. The work is technical and requires continuous knowledge of the numerous changes made during and since the war.(c.) Raihvay Accounts.Similar considerations apply to these Accounts, now being examined by the Ministry of Transport.(d.) Food Liquidation.This Department will cease to exist in 1922/23. Apart from outstanding claims, the most important of which may involve litigation, the work will consist of the completion of the Trading Accounts. It will be necessary for the Accounting Officer of the Board of Trade to explain and defend these Accounts to the Public Accounts Committee, and no transfer of responsibility would appear to be practicable or desirable at this stage.(e.) Wheat. Accounts.The final winding-up has been placed under the supervision of a reconstituted Wheat Commission, including Lord Crawford, Chairman of the original Wheat Commission, the Accounting Officer of the Board of Trade and a Treasury Representative. The main financial questions outstanding are concerned with the settlements with the Allies in respect of Inter-Allied trading transactions and a number of claims which are likely to involve litigation. Apart from this, the work will chiefly be the completion of the Trading Accounts and their presentation to the Public Accounts Committee. As in the case of the Food Accounts, no change is con-sidered desirable at this late stage.(f.) War Risks Insurance Accounts.This is merely a staff of three persons engaged in the final settlement of marine claims and the completion of the Trading Accounts, and the same considerations apply.(3.) Post-Wa(r Services more or less arising out of the War.(a.) Enemy Debts Clearing Office.This Service arises under the Treaties of Peace, and accounts fo*. the bulk of the aftermath staff under the Board of Trade. As the cost is met by fees, the net Vote is not affected, and the question is, therefore, one of Ministerial control and responsibility. On the institution of the Office, it was decided that the Board of Trade, as the Department responsible for the interests of British traders generally, and under the Peace Treaties in particular, should be responsible for this Service, the object of which is to secure by Clearing House arrangements the repayment to British traders of the pre-war debts of ex-enemy nationals. It is considered that any alteration of these arrangements would be most undesirable.(b.) Zinc Concentrates and Spelter.The contracts for the purchase of Australian Zinc Concentrates and Spelter continue till June 1930, so that they are not suitable for transfer to a temporary
[7802]Department. It is understood that they were entered into by the Board of Trade in 1910/17 as part of a policy then contemplated for the establishment in this country of the Zinc Smelting Industry, which before the war was largely under German control. The actual sales are conducted by the Zinc Producers&apos; Association and the British Metal Corporation, as agents for the Government, so that little departmental work is involved. It is considered that the Board of Trade should retain the responsibility for the policy underlying the original contracts and for the general control of sales; as well as for such modifications of the contracts from time to time as may be desirable and possible.(c.) Russian Claims Department.This work was entrusted to the Board of Trade as the Department responsible for the commercial negotiations with Russia. The acknowledgment by the Russian Government of liabilities for these claims so far as they are established will presume-ably be a condition of any general settlement with Russia, and there would appear to be no advantage in transferring the register of the claims, which is more or less complete, to another Department.(d.) Reparation Claims Department.- This Department is now engaged in furnishing Lord Sumner&apos;s Commission with particulars of the claims to compensation for damages made by individuals or firms which are to be paid out of the sum of  5,000,000 to be allocated out of the first Reparation receipts. While this Service has no close connection &quot;with the general work of the Board of Trade, it is hardly of a character suitable for amalga-mation with any liquidation work, and no alteration in its present location seems to be called for.It may be added that the cost of concentrating all the foregoing staffs in one building would be very heavy, and no compensating reduction in accommodation or rents would be secured. Moreover, the work of removal would divert the Office of Works staff from other concentration work productive of economy, and the anticipated reductions in the Liquidation staffs themselves would be delayed as a result of the temporary dislocation of work.The conclusion which, it is suggested, follows from the above analysis is that there would be no case for the establishment of any new Liquidation Department, but that, if it is desired on the winding-up of the Ministry of Transport and the Mines Department to relieve the Board of Trade of some of the duties Avhich would other-wise fall upon it, the disposal of the remaining timber stocks might be transferred, though not without some countervailing disadvantages, to the Disposal Board, as agents of the Board of Trade, and the final liquidation of Railway Accounts, and possibly Coal Mines Accounts, might be placed under the Liquidation Board of the Disposal and Liquidation Commission.
PAY. Introduction.1. In dealing with the Estimates of the various Departments, we have, as explained in the reports on those Departments, refrained from commenting on the question of the pay of Government servants, as we felt that this subject is one which could not conveniently be examined Departmentally, but required consideration on broader grounds so that the relative positions of the various classes could be reviewed.The State employs directly approximately 891,000 persons, and they may be divided into the following classes : Fighting Services Navy ... ... ...  122,000Army ... ... ... ...  210,000Air Force     ... ... ... ...    30,000-- 362,000Civil Service Supervisory, Technical, Clerical            ...          ... 160,800Messengers, Porters, Charwomen and similar Grades 20,000Manipulative Staff, such as Postmen, Sorters, &amp;c. 191,700Industrial Staff        ....         ...         ...         ... 156,500891,000In addition to the direct employees of the State, the Exchequer is responsible to a very large extent for the salaries paid to the Teaching Profession and to the Police, which number 211,000 and 60,000 respectively.The total salaries for which the State was responsible either in whole or in part, on the basis of the rates of salary and bonus current on the 1st September, 1921, were equivalent to  257,000,000 per annum. Of this amount  227,000,000 represented Exchequer liability. The total corresponding salaries borne by Exchequer and Rates amounted to approximately  90,000,000 before the war.Obviously the question of pay is one of great importance, affecting, as it does, nearly 1,200,000 individual employees, and every Taxpayer in the country.In such an investigation as ours, it is not practicable to do more than survey the position on broad general lines; elaborate machinery exists for dealing with rates of pay and conditions of service, and detailed examination of the various classes must be deferred until all the considerations can be fully argued and examined.It is exceedingly difficult to review on any ordinary basis, or to attempt to make any immediate saving in, the pay of certain sections of State servants for reasons which appear later. The question is extraordinarily technical and complicated, and our remarks must therefore be considered as general only, and must not be treated too meticulously.How Rates of Pay are Regulated.The procedure under which the rates of pay of various classes of State servants are fixed is set out below.2. Navy, Army and Air Force.The pay and allowances of Officers were revised in 1919 after the whole question had been fully considered by two Committees, one of which was presided over by a member of the Cabinet. It was decided at that time by the Cabinet that of the new rates of pay then fixed for the Officers 20 per cent, only should be considered as due to the high cost of living and should be subject after five years \i.e., in 1924) to change either upwards or downwards, according as the cost of living had risen or fallen in the intervening period, and that there should be revision thereafter every three years, up or down, on the basis of the official food prices index number. The food prices index number at the time the new rates took effect was 109.The rates of pay and allowances of &quot;other ranks &quot; are set out in Orders in Council and in Royal Warrants and form the bases on which the men enlisted or entered.PART XYIII.
3. Civil Service.In the case of the Civil Service, the rates of pay and conditions of service have been reviewed from time to time by various methods. In recent years they have usually, as regards the rank and file, been fixed after discussion on Whitley Councils, or other representative bodies, or as the result of a hearing before the Civil Service Arbitration Board.4. Teaching Profession.Teachers are not the direct employees of the State, and the State does not deter-mine the rates of pay. These are fixed by the Local Education Authorities, who are the direct employers. The question of the appropriate remuneration for teachers was considered by a Committee, presided over by Lord Burnham, which laid down in 1919 and 1920 scales of pay known as the Burnham scales. These scales, as will be shown later, greatly improved the position of the teachers, and have been adopted by the Local Education Authorities in a large number of cases. The Government did not insist on the application of these scales; but an intimation was made to Local Authorities that grant would be paid on salaries based on such scales.It is clear from an examination of the various documents that the scales are not fixed immutably. In the case of London they can be reviewed on the 1st April, 1923, and in other cases the statement of the President of the Board of Education limits the recognition of the new scales for purposes of grant up to the period ending the 31st March, 1925.5. Police Force.The rates of pay for the Police were considered in 1919 by a Committee presided over by Lord Desborough, when a single scale of remuneration was laid down. In this case the Government adopted the recommendations of the Committee and instructed the various Local Authorities to fix the wages of the Police on the Desborough scale, the additional expense falling on the Taxpayer being largely increased. In this way the rates of pay of the Police were made uniform throughout the whole of Great Britain. Hitherto the Metropolitan scale had always been higher than the scale applied in large boroughs, which in turn was generally higher than the rural scale.Rates of Pay.We will now deal seriatim with the pay in these Services.6. Fighting Services: Officers.Appendix (A) shows a comparison of the pay of various Officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force in 1914 and 1921. We understand these rates of pay, when fixed in 1919. were intended not only to cover the increased cost of living, but also to enable an Officer Avithout private means to take a normal share in the. life of his regiment Avhen first commissioned, and upon attaining the age of 30, to maintain a wife on his pay and allowances.The present rates of pay were fixed at a time when high rates were prevailing everywhere, and it Avas stated there was a reluctance to join or continue in the Forces. Conditions have now changed, and all classes of the community have had to adopt a less expensive standard of living.The following table shows a comparison, as closely as it can be calculated, of the Pay and also of the total emoluments, including the actuarial value of Pension Rights of Officers and Civil Servants at given ages :  Service.	Age.	Rank or Grade.	Pay.	Other Emoluments.*	Total.

They also include, an estimate of the actuarial value of pension rights. In the case of the Civil Service, bonus is included, and is calculated on the basis of a cost of living figure J00 per cent, above pre-war, but the bonus is automatically reduced as the index number fulls.
7. Other Ranks.As in the case of the Officers, the rates of pay were revised at a time when high rates of wages were prevailing outside the Services and we understand there was then a difficulty in obtaining recruits.Appendix (B) shows the actual rates paid to the various ranks in 1914 and in 1921, and these are exclusive of Rations, Clothing, Marriage Allowance and value of Pension Rights. In the case of a single man practically everything is found for him. A married man with two children would receive a marriage allowance of  1 per week on the basis of a cost of living 100 per cent, over pre-war; further, a considerable number of men in the Army and Air Force are granted quarters for their families.It will be observed that the percentage increases in pay range from 100 per cent, to 424 per cent, in certain ranks and are generally speaking now much higher in the Services than the increases in the weekly time-rates paid in Industry generally, which range from 82 per cent, to a maximum of 155 per cent., as set out in Appendix (C). Industrial rates are likely to be further reduced as the cost of living falls.8. Civil Service.We have been supplied with the following particulars showing for all Depart-ments in Great Britain the percentage in each salary range in 1914 and 1921, of the total staff, excluding Manipulative and Industrial staffs, Messengers, Charwomen and similar grades. The figures for 1921 include bonus based on a cost of living figure of 100 over pre-war.Salary Ranges, including Bonus.	1914.		1921.		,         1   Per Cent, of Numbers.    j       ToUl 1		Numbers.

There is a reduction in the under  200 range from 74-8 per cent, of the total to 49-7 per cent., which is counter-balanced by increased percentages in the other ranges. The improvement is due partly to bonus granted on cost of living grounds, partly to a revision of basic salaries or wages, and partly to reorganisation of various administrative, executive and clerical establishments, the full effect of which has not yet been felt. Any further increase of cost on this acpount, however, will be more than compensated by substantial savings due to reductions of pay in other directions.The average salary for all the above grades, inclusive of bonus, has increased from  174. to  281, i.e., by 61-8 per cent.If temporary staff are excluded and the comparison is limited solely to members of the permanent staff, the average salary for all the above grades has increased from  185-6 to  231-3 (exclusive of bonus), and to  370 inclusive of bonus, i.e., by 99 per cent. It should be mentioned in explanation of this figure of increased cost of the permanent staff that under present conditions the bulk of the routine clerical work of the Civil Service is assigned to members of the temporary staff. The average pre-war rate of  185-6 per annum indicated the general level of remuneration of permanent Civil Servants for all classes of work from the highest to the lowest, whereas to a very marked extent the average salary of  231-3 per annum now .p ay able to members of the permanent staff reflects, in general, the standard of remuneration of the better class work.
The pay of the Industrial and Manipulative staffs and of Messengers, Charwomen, &amp;c., has also been considerably improved apart from the application of bonus. The average annual cost for Departments in Great Britain, including bonus, is as under : 	1914.		1921.		Percentage Increase of	Number.	Cost per Head.	Number.

The following scheme was; introduced on the 1st March, 1920, but several schemes had already been in operation: 130 per cent, on ordinary remuneration not exceeding 35s. per week. 60 per cent, on ordinary remuneration in excess of 35s. per week, but notexceeding  200 per annum. 45 per cent, on ordinary remuneration in excess of  200 per annum.The maximum bonus was not to exceed  750, and the scheme provided for a periodical revision at intervals of four months during the first year and six months thereafter on the basis of an increase or reduction of 1 /26th of bonus for every five full points rise or fall in the cost of living index figure above or below 130.From the 1st September, 1921, onwards the bonus of all Officers receiving-salaries exceeding  500 per annum has been reduced by a super-cut, with the result that the highest rate of bonus now payable to any Officer is approximately  400. No officer on a salary of  2,000 or more receives any bonus, and bonus is not payable so as to bring total remuneration in any case above  2,000 per annum.The index figures for each month since March 1920 are set out in Appendix (D), together with the average figures on which the bonus rates were fixed.10. Teaching Profession.The Burnham Committee fixed standard scales for teachers, with the intention that one of these scales should apply to each area in the country. It was provided that the individual teacher was not merely to enter the appropriate scale at his existing salary, but to be put in the same position on the scale by three successive -yearly steps as he would have reached had the scale been in operation during the whole time he was a teacher a most unusual provision.The average salary of teachers on the 31st March, 1921, and under the full Burnham Scales compared with 1913/14, are set out in Appendix (E). The individual increases vary from 58 per cent, to 184 per cent. The average salary in elementary schools has increased from  99 per annum to  266 when the scales are fully operative, which will be reached during next year, an average increase of 169 per cent. These figures apply to England and Wales only, but we understand that in Scotland similar increases have been given. The striking feature about teachers&apos; salaries is that their increases have suffered no check with the large fall in the cost of living and are still automatically increasing.In considering the pay of teachers it must be borne in mind that &quot; Certificated &quot; teachers, who receive the highest salaries and who form the majority of the profes-sion, have generally spent two years in a Training College largely at the expense of the public. We are informed that in England and Wales  1,350,000 will be paid from Taxes and  350,000 from Rates for the training of teachers in the year 1922/23. Although the work may be exacting, the hours are short, the holidays long and the risk of unemployment slight. Further, they receive pensions paid by the&apos; State on a scale approximating to that of Civil Servants.
11. Police.The present scales of Police Pay are those recommended by the Desborough Committee, which reported in July 1919. This Committee recommended that the scales of pay of Police &quot;should be standardised throughout Great Britain, and a comparison of the rates of pay in 1914 and 1921 is set out in Appendix (F).It will be observed that the percentage increase in the case of Constables in rural counties amounts in some cases to 208 per cent, above pre-war, in Industrial Boroughs to 148 per cent, and in the Metropolitan Police to 133 per cent. The present scales are not subject to any reduction on the grounds of cost of living, as the floating bonus has already disappeared. We have already recommended in our report on Police that the obligation to pay the Metropolitan Police scale of remuneration in County and Borough Police Forces should be cancelled. In our opinion, there is no justification for paying a Constable in a rural County up to  234 per annum and Sergeants up to  292 per annum in addition to the Rent Aid, Boot allowances, free clothing and generous pension terms which are granted to all members of the Police Force. Their emoluments are exceptionally favourable compared with outside rates in skilled occupations.12. General Remarks.We have dealt in detail with the methods of fixing and the rates of remunera-tion for the various classes of State servants, showing how in each case their position has improved since 1914. We have also given similar information as regards Teachers and Police to the cost of which the Taxpayer largely contributes.The improvement in conditions has been by no means uniform, and we give below figures as to the average cost per head and the percentage improvement for the various classes which have been supplied to us. Comparison is, however, not easy where Navy and Army pay is involved, as the actual rates of pay do not by any means cover the whole of the emoluments. In the following table, so far as the Fighting Services are concerned, the emoluments include rations, fuel and light, cash allowances for lodgings and servants and in the case of men, clothing and marriage allowance, but nothing has been added for the value of quarters, free medical attendance, travelling concessions, customs privileges and the actuarial value of pension rights.Average per Head.1914.1922.Percentage.

The following diagram illustrates the relative percentage increases for the various classes : State Sekvices.VERAGE percentage increases per head in 1922, as compared with 1914, for various classes.
The diagram clearly shows that the percentage increases in the case of certain classes are more marked than in the case of others. When we consider the actual emoluments the differences are more striking.A Second Lieutenant in the Army on joining at 20 years of age now costs the State in one way or another  469 per annum. He has received an &quot;outfit allowance of  50. A Civil Servant, on entering the administrative class of the Civil Service at 22 or 23 years of age after a University education, would cost  368 per annum including both bonus and pension rights valued approximately at  168 per annum.In order to see how the Fighting Services compare with the Civil Service we have made a test of representative entries into the Higher Division of the Civil Service. We find that the average remuneration at age 30 is  607 per annum of which  242 represents bonus, liable to reduction in&apos; accordance with cost of living, and pension rights.An officer in the Navy at the same age would be a Lieutenant-Commander and in the Executive Branch with full allowances and value of pension rights would cost about  900 per annum. It is true that most of these allowances when afloat are taken in kind, but the allowances when ashore seem to us not to be an unfair basis for an -estimate of this kind. Engineering and Medical officers receive additional pay of approximately  70 and  90 per annum respectively.Similarly an Army Officer in the Combatant arms of the Service at the same age would in ordinary circumstances be a Captain and if married his total cost would amount to  794 per annum.  Other Anns receive an additional  54 15s. per annum.At the lower end of the scale it is therefore apparent that the Higher Division men in the Civil Service even with Bonus have fared worse than their contemporaries in the Fighting Services although they have passed a far higher examination on entrance and join at a later age.As regards the highest posts in the Services, it is admitted that every service must have a few plums in order to stimulate ambition and secure the necessary reward for ability and hard work.The following table shows the number of posts in each service of  2,000 per annum and upwards and the ratios these bear to the total personnel: No. of Posts, Total 2,000.and upwards. Personnel.

In reviewing the pay of the Fighting Services it is necessary to have regard to allowances which in the case of the Navy are on a liberal scale. Estimates have also to be made as to the value of the houses provided. The average amount of the pay and allowances of the six highest posts in the Navy is approximately  4,187 and in addition the five Commanders-in-Chief each receive an allowance of  2,464 per annum for Table Money. It must also be remembered that most allowances are not liable to Income Tax. For the six highest posts in the Army the average of pay and allowances is  4,513 per annum exclusive of Table Money. ...In these comparisons of the highest posts the value of pension rights is ignored as all the services are pensionable services, but it should be mentioned that in the Fighting Services an officer can retire at a much earlier age than the Civil Servant.It should be added that the total provision for Table Monev in the Navy is  77,000 a year and  15,000 for the Army.14. We have pointed out how the pay of the Fighting Services, Teachers and Police was fixed in 1919 under quite abnormal circumstances, and on a general survey we feel that the country cannot continue to support a burden of this magnitude.We recognise the complexity of the question and the difficulties in dealing with it, some of which we have referred to. We feel, however, that the subject is so far reaching that it calls for a thorough special investigation.* Excluding&apos; Native troops.
Such an investigation would necessarily have to cover not only the percentage increase, but also the relation of the pay and conditions of service of each grade to its corresponding grade in the public Service and in civil life. It would also have to take into account the contractual obligations existing and the possibilities of introducing new rates of pay and conditions of service for new entrants, also whether provision exists and has already operated to meet the reduced cost of living.We would also draw attention to the fact that in certain cases, e.g., Government offices in London, the lower grade staff paid on an overtime basis has a normal day from 10 to 5, with an interval for lunch and half-day on Saturday. This is a shorter day than obtains in outside employment, and might well be reviewed at the same time.Such an important and far-reaching enquiry is manifestly beyond the scope which was ever intended for this Committee, touching as it might the very varying conditions of life of 1^ millions of employees and their families. Indeed it is far beyond the time at our disposal to hold such an enquiry, and Ave have therefore refrained from making a recommendation, arrived at after inadequate investigation, and have contented ourselves with urging that the most expeditious and authoritative means available should be adopted for a thorough review of this important question.15. Non-Effective Charges and War Pensions.We have referred in our &quot; General Conclusions &quot; to Part I to the increase in the non-effective Votes which may follow the acceptance of our recommendations as to the personnel of the Fighting Services. This will depend on the number of Officers and men entitled to pension whose retirement is accelerated and the terms on which such retirement can be arranged. It is exceedingly difficult to arrive at an estimate of this increase, but we are advised it is not likely to exceed  10,000,000 for next year, and the annual charge for some years thereafter may be at the rate of  2,500.000 per annum. We consider these charges to be really &quot; aftermath &apos;&apos; charges, but having regard to the fact that special revenue is anticipated next year, we think that the spreading of such charges need not be considered as they can be carried on the Departmental Votes and met out of the Special Revenue.We also referred in the same Conclusions to the question of War Pensions and stated we proposed to forward our views on the method of dealing with this charge. As this question involves considerations of Budget policy we have come to the conclusion that it is outside our &quot; Terms of Reference.&quot;APPENDIX (A).Comparison of Rates of Pay only of Officers in the Navy, Army and Air Forcein 1914 and 1921.Navy.

CONCLUSION.1. In concluding our Report, we wish to bring to your notice certain aspects of the National Expenditure and difficulties in the way of control and of economy which have emerged during our consideration.In order to illustrate the difficulty of reducing national expenditure by . 175 millions in 1922/23 by means of administrative economies and Departmental control of expenditure, irrespective of policy and national obligations, we have prepared an approximate analysis of the expenditure of 1921/22, under thefollowing heads :-Class 1. Debt Charges ............      ........,,    2. Other Charges on Consolidated Fund      ....3. Pensions,,   4. Aftermath and other expenditure arising out ofthe War   ........................,,   5. Fighting Services      ................&apos;,,   6. Middle East    ........................,,    7. Other Civil ExpenditureThis analysis, with our observations, is set out below: Glass L-Debt Charges  ................ 345,000,000Class 2.

Other items of ex-penditure, such as Disposal and liquidation-tion Commission and Shipping liquidation-tion, are producing &quot; Special &quot; Revenue.191,216,500710,008,417
We therefore have a total of , 710,008,417, which in the main is outside the effective control of the administrative machine.2. There remain three classes, amounting in total to . 436,114,583, in which the bulk of the administrative economies has to be found.Class 5. Fighting Services Pay and Allowances Navy ....      ........army air Force  ....Other effective Expenditure Navy ............army air Force  .... 27,865,000 37,250,000 5,394,000 70,509,00047,982,000 37,388,700 11,422,70096,793,400 167,302,400As regards the sum of  702- millions for pay and allowances, and apart from the actual rates, which are fixed by Orders in Council or Royal War-rants, and dealt with in our chapter on Pay, the only Treasury con-trol exercisable is in the matter of numbers.The numbers and the proportions of officers, warrant officers, N.C.O.S and men are, however, governed by the technical advice which the Government receives.Considerations of policy, of prestige and of safety play an important part in the estimates for these Services, but there is also the same difficulty in criticising these estimates which arises whenever a layman questions the expenditure of technicians and experts. This difficulty is common to all the great practical activities of civil life, but in civil life the experts and technicians can usually be checked by obtaining a second opinion. Such possibilities do not occur with the Fighting Services, and the difficulty is thereby increased.As an example, we quote the case of the provisional estimates for the Navy, amounting to  81,183,800,&apos;which were submitted to us for the year 1922/23. These were described in the following terms by the Board of Admiralty in a letter to the Treasury, dated the 2nd August, 1921 :&apos; -&quot;... My Lords are satisfied that, with very few exceptions, the Votes as fixed for the present year are not susceptible of reductions if the Navy is to be maintained in a state of efficiency at the One-Power Standard laid down by His Majesty&apos;s Government. There are, however, certain risks which My Lords feel justified in accepting in the present financial situation, on the strength of the assurance of His Majesty&apos;s Government that a state of war within the next few years need not be regarded as a possible contingency, and by deferring or dispensing with services which would otherwise be regarded as essential they can definitely omit items in 1922/23 amounting to  1,968,400.&quot;It is the estimates thus referred to which are dealt with in our Report on the Navy, Chap. 1, Part 1. These estimates were framed before the Washington Conference was arranged and our Report took no account of its results. In view of such a pronouncement, a civilian might indeed shrink from suggesting any reduction in naval expenditure. We are, however, definitely of the opinion, after our investigation, that this grave advice cannot be justified. In our judgment, this is a forcible illustration of the financial danger of accepting unchallenged the dicta of Naval and Military experts. Their natural tendency is invariably to be satisfied with nothing short of perfection, to which must be added their inherent desire to maintain the prestige of the Service.We are convinced, on the facts submittecPto us, that great economies can be realised in the Fighting Services if the control of the Treasury over them is vastly increased and brought up to the standard obtaining in the Civil&apos; Departments. In the covering letter to our first interim Report we refer to the fact that for the Fighting Services a base line similar to that in use before the war by means of which the deviation in expenditure from year to year can be measured, is essential to Treasury control. We have endeavoured in our recommendations on those Services to enable you to re-establish that base line. If our recommendations are approved by you, we recommend for these Services the imposition of a definite ration.

Total1,146,123,000* This is a gross figure. In cases in which expenditure is recouped in part from Appropriations-in-Aid (e.g., Savings Bank Expenses) the recoup-,ment reduces the balance shown as Miscellaneous Expenditure, which must therefore be regarded as an approximately correct balancing figure.[7802]This is a legacy of the War. The policy  which governs our position in Palestine and Irak governs also this expenditure, but there can be real financial control by administrative methods which the Secretary of State for the Colonies is apply-ing, and from which we look for further economies.The size of the Civil Service depends no doubt largely on the policy of the Govern -ment, but it is subject to administrative con-trol.The pay of the Civil Service, except that of the limited number in the higher classes, is settled usually after discussion, and in eases where disagree-ment is recorded and recourse had to arbi-tration, control passes from the Treasury, a most undesirable state of affairs. Policy largely governs the second item (&quot; build-ings&quot;) - as well as &quot; pay.&quot; The other items in this class susceptible to adinini-strative economy have been dealt with in the appropriate chapters of our report.The items marked(t) are largely statutory grants and, save by an alteration of the statute or policy, economies cannot be made. The expenditure is a result of Parliaments deci-sions.Percentage grants marked ($) are, as we have shown in our report, really beyond administrative control except by the Spending Authority, which is . not the Government.
The above examination indicates we hope in a convenient form that ai regards roughly  700 millions out of  1,100 millions for the year 1921/22 furthej real substantial economy can only be achieved if changes are decided upon in thj policy already approved by Parliament.3. &quot;We were invited by the terms of reference to make recommendations foj effecting &quot; forthwith all possible reductions in the National Expenditure on Supplj Services.&quot; As great economies can only be obtained by curtailment of the leasj necessary activities, some measure of the reduction to be aimed at was requiredj The national ability to continue expenditure on objects which might be justified with an overflowing Exchequer is limited by the financial position in the yeai under review.As set out in the opening paragraphs of our First Interim Report, the sum to be aimed at as a reduction in the year 1922/23 was  175 millions, of which . 75 millions has already been indicated to you by the Departments.Our terms of reference permitted us to indicate economies which might be effected if particular policies were either adopted, abandoned, or modified.

The above examination indicates we hope in a convenient form that as regards roughly  700 millions out of  1,100 millions for the year 1921/22 further real substantial economy can only be achieved if changes are decided upon in the policy already approved by Parliament.3. We were invited by the terms of reference to make recommendations for effecting &quot; forthwith all possible reductions in the National Expenditure on Supply Services.&quot; As great economies can only be obtained by curtailment of the least necessary activities, some measure of the reduction to be aimed at wras required. The national ability to continue expenditure on objects which might be justified with an overflowing Exchequer is limited by the financial position in the year under review.As set out in the opening paragraphs of our First Interim Report, the sum to be aimed at as a reduction in the year 1922/23 was  175 millions, of which  75 millions has already been indicated to you by the Departments.Our terms of reference permitted us to indicate economies which might be effected if particular policies were either adopted, abandoned, or modified.

In order to make the further economies necessary, we have invited your attention to a reduction 1. In naval expenditure, as a result of the Washington Conference.2. In naval expenditure, under the heading of Oil Stocks and Oil Storage.3. In military expenditure, upon a review of the foreign garrisons abroad.We are confident that under these heads more than the  184 millions necessary to complete the total of  100 millions can be realised.4. We have therefore come to the end of our task, and have reviewed the expenditure remitted to us. Over a period of six months we have been in almost continuous session, and no member of the Committee has been absent from a meeting.We believe that the reductions we have proposed throughout are attainable if prompt action is being taken by the Departments upon the general lines of our suggestions, and with determination to effect economies. We have no doubt whatsoever that a close scrutiny of expenditure by the Departments themselves and by the Treasury will disclose the possibility of further economies on the lines we have followed, as our investigations could not be exhaustive.5. There is also one very important point in reserve. The Treasury in May last laid down that Departments should estimate upon a cost of living figure for the year 1922/23 of 100 per cent, above the pre-war level. As the cost of living has already fallen to 88 per cent, above the pre-war level, there appears to be more than a possibility that the Treasury forecast made in May last can be improved upon, and, as the cost of materials was also taken at the same hypothetical level, it will be seen that the estimates as a whole have in all probability a margin of further saving in sight. Agreements, contracts and purchases will cause difficulty in the full realisation of this fall in prices.We understand that the Revised Estimates of Civil Departments reflect, so far as could be forecast, the fall in prices of materials, but Revised Estimates have not been submitted by the Fighting Departments. We recommend that this point should be specially watched by the Treasury, and that each Department should specifically surrender such savings, so that the Taxpayer may benefit.We wish to take this, the last opportunity, of stating that the task you set us was to say where retrenchment could be carried out with the least harm in order at any rate to balance the national accounts.We do not lay claim to infallibility in our judgment, but hand you our final Report as the unanimous recommendations of five men of good will, desirous of advising you as to how, having regard to the revenue, the national Budget can best be balanced, and we suggest that criticism can only be constructive on the remit which you gave us if accompanied by concrete alternative proposals. It is in this sense that we hope the Government and the public will regard our Report.6. In conclusion, we desire to record our deep appreciation of the assistance we have received from all members of the Civil Service. In every Department our path was made smooth for us by the Minister. The officials have also done everything possible to assist us.With the Treasury, we were in constant partnership of effort, and to Sir Warren Fisher and his staff we offer our special thanks.Sir George Beharrell occupies a special place amongst those to whom we are indebted, and we must thank him particularly for the masterly aid he has given us.The Secretary of the Committee, Mr. G. A. Steel, and Mr. G. C. Upcott and Mr. James Milne, the officers specially attached to the Committee, brought marked ability and energy to a difficult task.   We give them our sincere and grateful thanks.We are, Sir,Your obedient servants, (Signed) ERIC GEDDES (Chairman).INCHCAPE. FARINGDON. J. P. MACLAY. W, GUY GRANET.(Signed)      G.. A.
