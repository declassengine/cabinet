it this Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty13 GovernmentSecret. Cabinet.Copy No.       -;*, P. 3770,1,Valuation and Rating Reform. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.I have carefully considered the Report of the Valuation and Rating Reform Committee (CP.3544) and while recognising the value of the administrative reforms proposed) I am bound to object strongly to a Bill being introduced to j?ive effect to them unless they are substantially modifiedj as I am satisfied that the occuniers of agricultural land would be gravely prejudiced, if the proposals were carried in their present form.     I make no objection to the principle of the proposed reforms as set out in paragraphs 38 to 46, which indeed seem logical and practical, but as the present antiquated system has resulted in low valuations for agricultural land and buildings the proposed reforms will almost certainly bring about an increase in such valuations and will therefore add to the rating burdens of agriculturists, at a time when they are justly clamouring for their abatement.Paragraphs 47 and 48 set out a scheme for equating existing reliefs which would stereotype for all time the present inadequate reliefs for rates on agricultural land and tithes on a basis which is estimated to represent sixty per cent for urban areas and fifty per cent for rural areas.I claim on behalf of agriculturists that there shall be no reform in the constitution and methods of rating authorities unless it can be accompanied by a new differentiation in the rating of agricultural land and tithes which shall afford substantial relief to agriculture, and I propose to submit proposals on this subject to the Cabinet very shortly.
The Valuation and Rating Reform Committee seem to have taken evidence only on technical points and while I have no doubt that they are correct in believing that the proposals will arouse the minimum of opposition in Parliament and in the country when considered as reforms;in machinery, I am satisfied that the agricultural interests will soon realise that the effect of reforming the machinery, so far from affecting any reduction in their existing burdens, will substantially increase them, and vehement opposition may be expected,Both landowners and farmers, especially the new and large class of small farmers o^ing their farms, are in a state of rebellion against the existinp pressure of local rates and would only accept reforms in machinery if accompanied by definite proposals for relieving their existinp burdens.February 23rd, 1922.A, 0.
