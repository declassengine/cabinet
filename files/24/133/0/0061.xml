DRAFTOP ABILLTo restrict the taking of legal pro-ceedings in respect of certain acts and matters done during the period of conflict in Ireland and to provide for matters consequential thereon.17th February 1922.36-2
Confidential.Indemnity (Ireland) Bill.NOTES ON CLAUSES.Clause 1.This clause, in giving a complete and comprehensive indemnity for all acts done by Crown servants in good faith in the execution of their duty in connection with the maintenance and restoration of order in Ireland, follows generally the form of s. 1. of the Indemnity Act of 1920.That Act, however, (1) saved claims arising out of contract;(2) saved claims founded on negligence ;(3) gave a substituted right for compensation where damage had been suffered by reason of interference with property or/ premises- under /, L the enactments relating to the Defence of the Realm.The  present Bill contains no corresponding pro-visions.As to (1), the Government will of course fulfil their obligations under contracts they have made.As to (2), most of the possible claims founded on negligence would be barred by the Public Authorities Protection Act, under which actions for such acts of negligence must be commenced within six months, wecEld-tcpp^r.As to (3), claims for compensation for damage to property or business by reason of action taken under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations will be made on the same basis as in cases where action wras taken under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.It is suggested that a promise might be given that disputes under (1), (2), and (3) would be referred to the War Compensation Court. Under present conditions it would be inexpedient to leave them to be dealt with by tribunals in Ireland.   Such a course would place thetaxpayers in Great Britain at the mercy of/ acs&amp;ceign / r.m /- a tribunal. &apos;    A &apos; ^    137-3 A
Subsection (1). The period proposed to be covered by the indemnity begins on the 23rd April 191G, the day preceding the outbreak of the &quot; Easter week Rebellion,&quot; and ends at the passing of the present Bill. It thus includes the period of the truce which began on the 11th July 1921 and the period subsequent to the 14th January 1922, when the Treaty was approved by the Southern Ireland members. Seeing that the martial law proclamations have never been formally revoked, that the Defence of the Realm Regulations and Restoration of Order in Ireland Begulations remain nominally in force and may have been acted upon, and that there were breaches, or alleged breaches, of the truce on both sides, it is submitted that servants of the Crown should not he left exposed to the risk of legal proceedings in Ireland on account of acts done in good faith, &amp;c.j subsequent to the commencement of the truce, and that the period in the draft should he retained. *       !The indemnity is wide enough to cover acts done outside Ireland,&apos;if done for and in connection witj the maintenance and restoration of order in Ireland, e.g., the detention in Great Britain of Irish internees under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations. In the same way the Indemnity Act, 1920, was not confined to acts done in the United Kingdom but extended to acts wherever clone, whether within or without His Majesty&apos;s Dominions.Subsection (2) includes a petition of right amongst the legal proceedings prohibited by the section. i It is a reproduction of subsection (2) of section one of the Indemnity Act, 1920.iSubsection (3). If proceedings are taken against a Crown servant or a person who actedamder his authority, the defendant, in order to obtain the benefit of the indemnity, must prove certain facts, e.g., that the act complained of was done for or in connection with&apos;the maintenance or restoration of order in Ireland, that it was done in the execution of a duty, or that the defendant was acting under the authority of a servant of the Crown; In order to enable such facts to be proved without unnecessary legal formalities, and expense, the subsection, following the lines of - the Indemnity Act, 1920, provides that a certificate from a Secretary of State is to be sufficient evidence of the fact. . &apos;  :
Clause 2.This clause, in pursuance of the agreement with the Irish Provisional Government, .proposes to bar all claims for criminal injuries clue to the late disturbances in Ireland.So far as claims for injuries to property are con-cerned, all such claims, hy whomsoever the injuries were committed, will be dealt with by a Vice-regal Corn-mission set up in accordance with the agreement with the Provisional Government. The Commission will have power to review the amounts awarded by decrees already made in undefended cases. All claims assessed by the Commission and the amounts aAvarded by decrees already made, subject to such review as aforesaid, will in the first instance be met by the Irish Government, the Irish Government being recouped by the British Government in an agreed proportion of the total amount.So far as claims for personal injuries are concerned, the British Government has undertaken to be responsible for the payment of compensation to its own sup-porters. This in effect covers all persons who establish or have established claims under the Criminal Injuries Acts. Under those Acts the only persons who can claim for personal injuries are Crown servants, or persons who suffered through unlawful associations or meetings. The greater proportion of these have already been the subject of awards by the tribunals under the existing Acts, and a considerable portion of the awards have been discharged by means of deductions from the local taxation account grants. The British Government has undertaken to assume responsibility for these pay-ments, including the repayment of intercepted payments from the local taxation account.So far as there are any claims in respect of which a final decree has not yet been given, means will have to be found to assess the amounts, either by the establish-ment of a tribunal or otherwise, and the amount when assessed will be paid by the British Government.It would not be possible to entrust the assessment to an Irish tribunal. The result would be that/some cases the claimant would be a highly unpopular individual, and be awarded too little, whilst in other cases the tribunal Avould be generous at the expense of the British Exchequer.37 A 2
The clause as drafted relates only to proceedings in respect of injuries sustained in Southern Ireland. The injuries sustained in Northern Ireland are primarily a matter to be dealt with by the Northern Government and Parliament, and it would be impossible to justify the barring of Northern Ireland proceedings by the present Bill. Criminal injuries in the North stand on a different footing from the injuries in the South. In the North the injuries wrere inflicted by one section of the population upon another section in the course of what may be called an endemic party feud. Such injuries come normally within the Criminal Injuries Code, and the majority of the local authorities in the North have admitted their liability to pay compensation and have taken steps to satisfy the decrees. In the South, on the other hand, the injuries were inflicted in the course of a conflict between the Crown forces and their sympathisers on the one side and the mass of the population on the other, and the Criminal Injuries Code cannot reasonably be applied to such conditions.It is understood that it has been arranged that the principle of the agreement with the Provisional Govern-ment is to be extended to compensation for criminal injuries in the North. In that event it would be for the Northern Parliament to take such course as they think proper in relieving their local authorities from the burden of compensation by grants in aid, or otherwise, and in barring pending and future claims.Subsection (1). This subsection prohibits the institu-tion of proceedings in respect of criminal injuries sustained in Southern Ireland between the 21st of January, 1919, and the 11th of July, 1921, being the period between the repudiation of liability by Sinn Peinn (i.e., Dail Eireann) and the truce. It leaves untouched the right to institute proceedings in respect of injuries sustained outside this period. Injuries sustained prior to the 21st of January, 1919, have probably all been the subject of pro-ceedings already taken and disposed of, seeing that, under the law as it then stood, the proceedings had to be initiated within a short period after the date of the injuries. By a subsequent statute-the Criminal Injuries (Ireland) Act, 1920 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5, c. 66, s. 6) the court or judge wras empowered to extend the time for taking proceedings where it appeared just and reasonable, and this had the effect of enabling claims to be entertained although under
the pre-existing law they could not have been sustained, and there may be claims of this description pending.New claims may also arise in respect of injuries sus-tained after the 11th of July, 1921, and under the clause as it stands such claims could be prosecuted in the ordinary way. The responsibility of the Free State Government appears to extend to such cases.Subsection (2). This subsection prohibits the en-forcement of decrees already obtained in respect of injuries sustained during the said period. It does not prevent the enforcement of decrees in respect of injuries outside the period. If they are decrees in respect of personal injuries, they would be covered by par. 4 of the working arrangements, or if not so covered would be discharged primarily by the British Government, but if in respect of injuries to property, the remedy will still be against the local authorities.Subsection (3). The object of this subsectioa is to confer upon the agreed Commission, and upon any other tribunal that may be set up to deal with claims for personal injuries, the powers of enforcing the attendance of witnesses and examining them on oath, and compelling the production of documents. The shortest method of doing this is by applying section 1 of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, under which such powers can he conferred upon any tribunal appointed in pursuance of a resolution of both Houses of Parliament to inquire into a definite matter of urgent public importance described in the resolution.
