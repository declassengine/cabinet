OddTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.CABINET .INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION.Instructions to the Britiah Government Representative on the Governing Body of the International Labour organisation.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR.ORET. 1.     A question has arisen as to the future composition of the Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation.     Its present constitution (as set out in the Appendix) has given die-satiefaction on the three grounds -(a) that interest in the work of the Organisation is restricted because of the non-representation of small or countries and non-European States;(b) thftt the present constitution tends to give a socialist bloc consisting of continental workers and Government representa-tives of smaller States an undesirable predominance;(o) that the Hat of the eight States of chief industrial importance should be revised. 2.    Attempts have been made to meet the first and last points by re-arrangements within the terms of Article 393 of the Treaty of Versailles.     These re-arrangements will be considered at the next Session of the General Conference of the Organisation, but it is plain that a more permanent settlement involving Treaty revision will bo pressed for and is desirable. 3.     This settlement would probably involve an increase in tho size of the Governing Body from 24 to 32 (i,e, 16 Government representatives, 8 Employers and 8 Workers) and representation of Governments at any rate on a geographical basis.     I am inclined to support a proposal for a revision of tho Treaty in this direo-tion, because if properly adjusted it might remove the difficul-tiee mentioned.4.     I accordingly propose, unless any dissent is expressed by my colleagues, to support a proposal to revise the Treaty as suggested above.(Sgd.) T.J. MACNAMARA. Ministry of Labour. 22nd February, 1922 .
