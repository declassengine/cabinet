POST OFFICE.

Mr. Kellaway&apos;s estimated Post Office Profit on the Commercial Account for 1922/23 is £8,100,000, the same figure, though varying in regard to details, as was laid before the Geddes Committee.

He proposes to distribute £7,270,000 in reduced charges, and to restore ? collections (but net deliveries) involving additional expenditure of £230,000, making £7,500,000 and leaving a surplus of £800,000.

The estimated deficit for 1921/22 is now brought down to £2,145,000 on the Commercial Account, as against £3,155,000 the figure supplied to the Geddes Committee.

The Geddes Committee (paragraph 16) refer to the pledge given by the Postmaster-General on May 24th, 1921, in the House of  Commons, and observe:-

"This pledge was given in relation to specific increases, and we understand that the increases imposed at that date may be estimated to yield at the rate of £2,000,000 per annum.

In the present financial condition of the country we do not think it unreasonable that a great monopoly like the Postal Telegraph and Telephone Services should yield some return to the Exchequer in respect of the capital invested especially having regard to the fast that if it were in the hands of Trading Companies, the Government would receive substantial payments in respect of Income Tax. Corporation Tax and Property Tax.

It may be that in certain cases additional not revenue could be derived from a reduction in charges and to such reduction no exception can be taken ............."

 estimates in regard to Postcards and Printed papers are on assumption that the Letter rate is simultaneously reduced Letters remain at 2d. and postcards are reduced to 1d. assumably this would stimulate the use of 1.d postcards and consequently increase the loss on the reduction).

Mr. Kellaway in the House of Commons on the 9th as on Post Office Supply generalised the pledge saying "If are to have surpluses in the future I do not want them raided the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I got the Cabinet to agree at any surplus which is effected will go not to the Exchequer ? to the reduction of charges." But the underlined words ? that he is referring to the pledge of 24th May which was ? related to these increases.

Mr. Chamberlain on the 16th ultimo, in the ? of Commons said:-

"The considered views of the Government on this subject are explicitly stated by the Postmaster-General in reply to a ? on 24th May last, and referred to again by him on ? June in the course of teh Debate. The Government is prepared ? stand by the statement made on 24th May, but the whole matter ? Post Office costs is at present being investigated by the committee on National Expenditure, and it would be proper to submit their Report before making any specific decisions. I might add, of course, that for the current year there is a deficit, ? a surplus on the Post Office."

From the Budget point of view, the Treasury be more interested in the Post Office Exchequer Account (the comparison of cash receipts with cash expenditure) than with the commercial account.

Mr. Kellaway does not now say what on the revised figures would be the Exchequer Account position but the ? Committee say that the Exchequer Account Estimates for


for 1922/23 foreshadow a surplus on the th ,      ,   ik* a whole of  5,140,000, and thia sum may for thvbe taken aa the Exchequer Account surplus equiva. .to the Commercial Account surplus of - 8,100,000.Mr. iiellaway!s proposal to distribute surpluses in reduction of charge world affect the Exchequer Account by 7lmi.lliona. less - 620,000* s  6,880,000.        it would therefore mean a deficit on Exchequer Account aa a whole of  1,740,000.The increased rate,5 of June last were imposed withthe intention,of providing increased revenue to&quot; meet the anticipated deficit on Post Office commercial account andthe Postmastor&quot;&quot;General stated the figures aa follows:-Deficit in round fi-$ftreemillions actually  5,436,000Revenue from increased charges       ) 2^ millions ) ... *) &quot;  3,453,000Sunday Deliveries and collections ) .......\  1   million   J* so : far; from/the deficit -having- - -been&apos; Covered, it now appearsthat it exceeds.-  2^0(^000.:-     The Ge-ddea Committee - take the further point that the . Post Office-does-not pay -Income Tax, Corporation Tax-or any.,other form of -*ds*ty -which J-t -mould do if it&apos; &quot;were a ^private Company.   Tba.. Exchequer surely ought to be placedin no worse a position than if the Post Office were being conducted by private enterprise.To*   services rendered to other Government Departments.
R! S , B *Treasury ;Gmm$m:.3rd March, 1922.To sum up 5,(a) the pledge relied upon by Mr. Ke 1 la way^ -only^af rect3Certain,-specific- increases,. -,-ajo-d... ought not to be extended to&quot; ----cover all increases of charges since 1914/(b) the aurplus - which is a commercial account not an jptchequer Recount surplus - is still only an estimated surplus.   The pledge does not arise until It la assured. A riae in cost of living would upset all the estimates.(c) Mr. Kellaway&apos;a proposals would result in an Exchequer Account deficit for 1922/23 of about if millions.(d) Ho announcement ought in any case to be made except in connection with the, Budget when it is possible to review the whole1 Exchequers position.(e) The Exchequer Has a perfectly good claim to retain .a.0 much of the surplus as represents a tax contribution equal in amount to what a private company would pay.(f) If nevertheless it Is desired to make some concession, the printed paper concession coating It millions net would bethe most helpful to trade and industry and the reduction in the Postcard would allay ,a good deal of complaint but we should &quot;keep the 2d. letter.   The telephone reduction might be considered if necessary, but it Is not subject to the pledge of 24th May.
