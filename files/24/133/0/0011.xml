c.80Military Secret. 1531From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,6tk February 1922.ISO. We feel, that, with the object of enabling His Majesty&apos;s Government to arrive at a decision regarding our proposals as to the strength of British troops to be maintained in India, first, during ensuing financial year, and, secondly, with effect from commencement of following year, and in order to prevent misunderstandings, the time has come to place before yon our considered views regarding the military situation in India and its relation to existing financial and political situation.On a clear appreciation of these three factors must depend decision which we have to take, in.consultation with.His Majesty&apos;s Government, on a number of inter-relating questions, such as (? referred to in your telegram )s of 1-1 tlx January, No. 19-1, and No. 286, dated 20th January; telegram from War Office to Oonimander-iu-Chief, No. 6-1351, dated 2Jst January, and your No. 410, dated 28th January. We feel that the need for a re-examination of this question in its proper perspective is all the greater because we have had occasion to submit to you, from time to time during the past few months, expressions of opinion reflecting at times divergent points of view, and reflecting again the succeeding phases of the situation which is constantly varying with reference to such facts as, for example, the recently concluded treaty with Afghanistan ; the developments of our policy in Waziristan; and the extensive enlargement of the activities of the non-co-operators.2. As you are aware, our financial situation is causing us grave embarrassment. We are faced, with a deficit of over 41) crores in the current year, and the gap which we have to bridge between revenue and expenditure in 1922-23 is almost all (sic) as large.We are convinced of the imperative necessity for securing financial equilibrium, since the alternative will be a progressive deterioration of our financial position which, unless checked, must have grave consequences. Our object can be only attained by increasing our revenue on the one hand, and. by effecting economies on the other hand. The Army, although not absorbing a higher proportion of our total revenues than it has done for past 20 years, does consume now roughly one-half of our central revenues, and clearly offers the widest field for retrenchment. As you are aware, we have been engaged for weeks past in exploring every possibility of effecting economies without endangering the national safety. Although safety and security must be always dominant factor, financial considerations cannot be ignored. Financial position of the country must have, indeed, a marked political reactiou on.the question of safety and security. For a scale of military expenditure which is largely in excess of our means not only adds to the burden of taxation, but also renders it impracticable to devote adequate funds to other urgently needed administrative measures, impedes industrial and economic developments, raises prices, and thus creates such political discontent as seriously to aggravate the widespread unrest now prevailing in many parts ot India.3. It is mainly for these reasons that we have put before you, in pur. Army-Department telegrams 43, 11th January, 68, 16th January, and 115, 23rd January,, our proposals for effecting various reductions in the established charges of the Army. &quot;Those which most closely affect purpose of present telegram are :  Firstly, request put forward in para. 5 of our telegram of the 1] th ultimo for permission to inform Legislature that notice has been given by its to His Majesty&apos;s Government of the reduction proposed by Military liequirements Committee in the number of British units ; and secondly, proposal referred to in our telegram of the 23rd ultimo, 115, to take credit in next year&apos;s Budget for a definite saving of 50 lakhs on account of an estimated shortage of approximately 5,OJ0 British troops, for the first half of next financial year.At the same time, in the former of these two telegrams, we felt it necessary to -enter a caveat that, in certain circumstances, we might ask to be allowed to retain temporarily British units of the reduction of which we propose now to give notice to His Majesty&apos;s Government.Four reasons which, in onr opinion, justify our proposals to accept, at least for the first six months of the next financial year, a definite shortage of some 5,00 ) British&apos; troops are :  fhat, in point, of fact, shortage has been even greater than this during the past twelve months ;   and, second, as we had received  information from the
War Office that no increase to drafts lor India Avar (sic, ? was) possible during present year, we had every reason to anticipate that this shortage will actually exist, and we therefore saw no reason why we should not take credit in the budget for the resultant savings. Thirdly, Treaty with Afghanistan lias been reeenth concluded, and although we do not delude ourselves into belief that this circumstance &quot;affords any certain guarantee that we (? shall omitted) not be forced again into hostilities with Afghanistan, we think that we are now justified in counting upon greater stability of peaceful relations with Afghanistan for some time to come. Yon will remember that when Military Requirements Committee reported, and the Government of India adopted the conditions, there was imminent danger of the Mission having to leave Kabul without a Treaty.We adhere to our proposal to take credit for shortage of troops, though we recognise shortage may be reduced by two factors of which we were not aware at the time Ave made this proposal. These factors are, firstly, that the recall of certain Irish regiments to England, preparatory to disband men t, of which intimation has been given us in the telegram from the War Office, 0-135.1 of 21st January, and their replacement by an equal number of British battalions, may result in our receiving battalions up to full strength, in place of battalions which, according to our latest strength returns, are now over eOO below strength. Second factor is that in the same telegram it is suggested that, in view of the projected disbandment of these Irish battalions, and the estimated shortage of approximately 5,UU0 men in India, as many as possible of the men belonging to these battalions should be offered voluntary transfer to other battalions in India. We cannot estimate what response would be forthcoming to this offer should it be decided to make it ; but the shortage for which we are taking the credit is likely to be somewhat diminished on this account also.5. Turning to our other main proposal, viz., that we should give immediate notice to War Office of a reduction of five British Infantry battalions and three British Cava ry regiments, to take effect a year hence, we would point out that, unlike the temporary shortage, it will be a permanent reduction, counterbalanced to-some extent by an increase in the number of Indian Infantry battalions and Cavalry regiments, as proposed by the Military Requirements Committee.To explain and justify this permanent reduction in the British garrison, we have to examine internal political situation confronting us to-day, and attempt to forecast the immediate future. The indications are that the extremists are about to stake their last card, and, by instituting civil disobedience, to force on us an open trial of strength. We do not s( ek to minimise risk of serious and widespread disturbance Avhich may result from this movement on their part. If they adhere to their present intention, it means that we must come to grips with this agitation, and, if so, we think it quite possible that, in the course of the next few months, we may have to employ our armed forces, on a relatively large scale, in suppressing disturbances and restoring order. We shall have then dealt a severe blow to an agitation which has kept the country in a state of constant unrest for many months past, and has hampered us in carrying our, schemes of Army reorganisation. The point which we desire to emphasize is that this issue will, in our opinion, be decided, one way or the other, in the course of the next few mouths. But (? it omitted) may be that the conditions at the end of this period will not permit us to reduce tiie number of British troops at once, and in that case we should desire to retain thorn until the reduction could be safely made. Meanwhile, we shall be preparing for substitution of Indian troops for British in accordance with recommendation of Military Kequi rements Committee.We hope and believe, however, that, even if wiser counsels do not prevail, and if avo are compelled to reply by force to the open challenge of Government authority noAV contemplated by extremists, Ave shall succeed in seriously weakening, even although we do not crush this pernicious agitation. The result should be the inauguration of a period of freedom from serious outbreaks of violence, and in consequence there would be less need for use of strong military forces for internal: security purposes. It is in this hope and expectation that we feel justified, having regard to our present financial embarrassments, and to the insistent demand of moderate Indian opinion for a reduction in the cost of the Army, to ask leave to give notice now of a reduction of British troops to take effect a year hence.8. Coupled with this request Ave have, for the reasons already given, thought it necessary to issue warning that, if the situation changes in the interval for the worse, Ave may have, before the year has expired, to ask permission to retain these troops
temporarily. We recognise the&apos; inconvenience that may be caused to His Majesty&apos;s Government by the existence of this contingent liability, but we would remind vou that we have, ever since the war ended, assisted His Majesty&apos;s Government by lending large numbers of Indian troops for service over (? sea omitted), under conditions much more indefinite than those we now ask 1Jis Majesty&apos;s Government to accept in respect of these British troops, and this indefinite liability still continues. We believe the internal political situation in India will, a year hence, be such that we can then safely dispense with a (&apos;? certain) (? omission) British units. If we prove right, well and good. If, unfortunately, our expectations are falsified, all we ask is to be allowed to retain troops until conditions improve. Cost will fall on us. It will merely be a continuance of the existing arrangement, and a postponement of the desired reduction.0. Of course, if the other contingencies numbered 1, 2 and 3 in our telegram 22, 7th January 1922, arise, we shall have to call on His Majesty&apos;s Government for assistance, but our whole military policy and organisation have always been based on principle that, in the last resort, we must look to Great Britain for assistance necessary to preserve the integrity of the Empire. We feel sure that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no desire to divest themselves of their share of responsibility for safety of India, and that when military situation, whether external or internal, is beyond our capacity to deal with, we can count upon help from Great Britain, just as Great Britain counted upon help from us in the Great War.10. We have, in the foregoing paragraphs, attempted to give an appreciation of the military situation, viewed in its relation to the political and financial situation. The policy we wish to follow may be summarised as follows briefly ; First. To make such immediate economies in military expenditure as are con-sistent with national security.   We have in recent telegrams made various proposals to this end. Second. To make permanent reduction in the number of British troops, whichare more costly than we can afford, so soon as situation justifies such ared notion.Third. To put into effect a progressive scheme for the substitution of Indian officers for British officers throughout the Indian Army, exclusive of Gurkhas. See our telegram of the 23rd ultimo, 113.Fourth-. To encourage Territorial Force movement.11. It is in order to satisfy Indian opinion that we are in earnest in our desire to reduce British troops and to Indianise tho Army, that we have asked your per-mission in my Army Department telegram 43, 11th January to publish some of the conclusions of Military Requirements Committee, and to make an announcement regarding Indianisation of the Indian Army. As regards Military Requirements Committee, we propose, if you agree, to publish the whole of report, omitting paras. 6 to 17, and omitting from the remaiuder of the report such passages as it seems to us inadvisable to make public, as well as all reference to names of witnesses, &amp;c.12. In my Foreign and Political Dept. telegram 118 S., dated 30th January, we have submitted our views regarding future policy in Waziristan. According to views of Committee, the scheme which we recommend is only the second best. Military opinion, supported by that of experienced frontier officers of the Political Department, is in favour (? of omitted) continuance of permanent occupation of Central Waziristan by regular forces, and the domination of the country up to Durand line.Apart from other considerations, however, financial stringency precludes our adopting this policy, and we have been obliged, therefore, to adopt a less expensive alternative. We believe, moreover, that there will be less risk of this policy proving more costly than (? as) estimated. On the other hand, as experience has shown, we cannot feel any (sic ? very) certain that the result of the adoption of a forward military policy will not be a serious excess over any forecast which we can make. But the policy which we propose to follow, oilers, in our opinion, a reasonable chance of bringing about an improvement in our relations with the Mahsuds, and involves risks no greater than we feel justified in taking.13. Whilst we have always kept in mind that national safety must be predominant factor, we are compelled to have regard to the serious financial position. It is the combination of these two considerations that has led us to adopt the policy involving-expenditure as indicated above.
14. Above statement gives our appreciation of political conditions affecting military requirements of the immediate future. Our Army Department telegram 22 of 7th January was intended to be an exhaustive (? return of the) various situations which military authorities might be called on to meet, and a forecast of the assistance which they might require from home in certain (? eventualities). That telegram reflects a totally different point of view from that taken in our Military Budget telegrams, and pays no regard to financial considerations. It represents the sum of total demands, which according to expert military opinion might be made in the future under certain specified contingencies ; but was never intended as a survey of political situation.15. In conclusion, we must, impress upon you, with the utmost earnestness, that we have in any event a very difficult situation to meet. With political situation \ou are familiar. On top of this we are confronted with necessity of imposing, for the second year in succession, very heavy additional taxation. That taxation will inevitably be challenged as being due to heavy expenditure connected with maintenance of our Army. It is our considered opinion that in order to avoid a complete breakdown, it is essential that, we should be allowed to make the two announcements referred to in para. 11 antecedent. Unless we receive your permission to do so, consequences must be, we consider, grave, involving serious risks of complete breakdown of the Reforms Scheme, and rendering administration of this country most difficult.
