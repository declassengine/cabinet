C.P. 3792.

POST OFFICE CHARGES.

(Memorandum by the Postmaster General).

1. The principal Post Office rates have been increased since 1914 as follows:-

Pre-War Present

Letters (initial rate) 1d 2d

Postcards 1/2d 1 1/2d

Printed Papers (initial rate) 1/2d 1d

Parcels (average receipt) 5d 1/-

Telegrams (12 words) 6d 1/-

Telephone charges average increase of 80%



The last increase took effect in June 1921 when the charges for postcards and printed papers were raised to the present figure.

In sanctioning these increases on May 12th 1921 (Cabinet 39 (21)), the Cabinet, on the recomnendation of a Sub Committee presided ever by Sir Eric Geddes, authorised me to announce that "the Government recognise, that when costs are reduced the user of the postal services is entitled to get the benefit, and that such reductions as are possible in the rates now imposed will be made as soon as a surplus on the Post Office balance sheet is assured." Acting on this authority I announced in the House of Commons on May 24th 1921, that these increases are imposed solely to meet the exceptionally high costs at present prevailing. As soon as a fall in costs assures a surplus on the Post Office balance sheet, the public will be given the benefit of it by a reduction in charges."

Similar pledges have been given by me in reply to numerous

I also recommend the restoration of Sunday oolleotions (tut not deliveries), which will involve an additional expend!ture of  230,000,     The total estimated cost of these oonoeosions will therefore he  7,500,000, leaving an estimated balance of  600,000 on ne::t year Post Office accounts, without allovring for the nett saving of  750,000 from the transfer of the Southern Irish Post Office to the Irish Free State* 6,     The increases in rates last year met with strong opposition both in the House of Commons and outside, which showed no signs of diminishing*     1 receive representations almost daily from Chanters of Ccmnerce and other influential commercial bodies urging the Government to redeem their pledges of last year, and I believe that the reductions which I propose wQuld,not ,on^y ,be an extremely popular ooncession but would give a substantial stimulus to trade.     I think the view of the business community is oorrectly represented by the following resolution which was uhahiraousTy passed by the Poet Office Advisory Council,-. rffhat this Council,twhile willing to support the imposition of such charges as are required to cover the expenditure of the&apos; Post Off ice&apos;,&quot; considers &quot;that,&quot;in &quot;the Interests of Commerce and Industry the present rates, which were specifically imposed to meet abnormal coots, should be reduced5! oKO I 3W*as and when those costs decline,The&quot; Council understands that in 1928-83 a large-! surplus - -on the Post Office balance sheet is anticipated and it ^desires&quot; (to, record its, opinion that,, this surplus, should be allocated --to. -v&apos;v &quot;* ;  v    * &quot;&quot; * ; , .     :     JO-jfX WWII tiOXi.&apos;the reduction of Post Office charges in preference to being -merged 4n. the, National rEevenue or applle.d^,:&apos;tffl: any other ^purpbse.,;;Die Council requests the Postmaster General to convey their, opinion to the Government and to urge the Government forthwith&quot;.to redeem, their pledge fthatiWhen costs;&apos;are-reduced the user of&quot;* * - ( )**!j*teo sat ox.-the -Postal services &quot;Ehall get &quot;the&quot; benefit&quot;.&quot;&quot;
I would urge the desirability of announcing the intended reductions as soon as possible. This is a point which has been impressed on me by the Associated Chambers of Commerce, the F.B.I. and the allied Printing Trade Council. This last body state that large contracts for printing are placed at this period of the year, that these are being held up owing to the high postal charges and that the knowledge that postal charges are to be reduced on April 1st would release a considerable body of orders and thus reduce the great amount of unemployment in the Printing Trades. A month&apos;s notice is also required for printing stamps, postcards, etc.
