[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1922.SECRET.CP. 3723.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the (5th instant.General State of the Country.Police Reports of the Week.I regret to state that attacks upon the Crown Forces figure prominently in the Police Reports of the week. It is, unfortunately, becoming more apparent every day that the I.R.A. in many parts of the country are completely out of hand, and that unless immediate measures to restore discipline are taken by the heads of the organisation they will find themselves confronted with&apos; a situation in which they will be powerless to guarantee the continued observance of the Truce by a consider-able section of their followers.The most serious outrage of the week was the murder of two English Constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who were shot in cold blood at Lisdoonvarna, Co. Clare, on the evening of the 2nd instant. According to the Police Report, there is-little doubt that this crime was committed by members of the I.R.A., and that it was intended as a reprisal for the wounding of a number of children at Ennistyrnon on the previous day by a bomb, which is alleged to have been thrown from the R.I.C. Barrack. The District Inspector at Ennistymon, reporting with reference to the latter incident, states that the bomb was thrown on to the street while the Barrack was being evacuated, and that he has come to the conclusion that it was thrown by a member of the garrison, whom he has placed under arrest. Three children were seriously injured and nine slightly injured by the explosion. There is no suggestion that the two unfortunate Constables at Lisdoonvarna, upon whom vengeance was taken the following day, were in any way implicated in this incident.Among the other outrages upon the Police Forces committed during the week were the wounding of a temporary Constable by a bomb in Limerick City on the 30th ultimo; the firing at a Constable in Letterkenny District, Co. Donegal, on the 31st ultimo; a serious assault upon two Constables at Kells, Co. Meath, on the 2nd instant, resulting in the wounding of one Constable and one civilian; the disarming of a Constable at Carrick-on-Suir, Co. Tipperary, on the 3rd instant; the seizure and destruction of a police motor tender at Creeveroe, Mountbellew District, Co. Galway, on the 4th instant, the occupants of the lorry being taken prisoners and subsequently released; and an assault upon two Constables at Golden, Co. Tipperary, on the 5th instant. The last-mentioned assault appears to have been a case of ordinary robbery with violence. One Constable was robbed of the sum of  1 6s. in money and the other of his boots and clothing to the value of about  10.I have omitted from this list of outrages the shooting of an R.I.C. Constable at Killarney on the 2nd instant, in regard to which there at present exists a direct conflict of testimony. According to the Police Report, seven members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, all unarmed, were returning from the town of Killarney to their Barracks, when they were fired upon without being challenged by a party of I.R.A. Police, and one Constable was mortally wounded. The I.R.A. version, as furnished by the Chief Sinn Fein Liaison Officer, alleges that the Police, when challenged by their patrol, ignored the order to halt and opened fire, whereupon the fire was [7840]
returned. The inquest upon the dead Constable had to be abandoned owing to the absence of jurors, and no independent evidence has yet been forthcoming in support of either of these versions of the occurrence.In addition to the above attacks upon the Police, the breaches of the Truce committed during the week included a raid upon an ammunition store attached to the Military Barracks at Fethard, Co. Tipperary, on the 30th ultimo, in which a Lewis gun with fifty magazines, and a quantity of small-arms ammunition, were taken; the seizure of a quantity of goods from a Military store at Renmore, Co. Galway, on the 1st instant, and the disarming of a soldier at Sligo on the 4th instant.Other outrages included four raids for arms, four raids on mails, the theft of eight motor cars and five bicycles belonging to the Police or Military, and six cases of armed robbery. Among the last-mentioned cases were the robbery of  556 from the Northern Bank at Kingscourt, Co. Cavan. on the 3rd instant, and that of  394 from the Provincial Bank of Ireland at Birr, King&apos;s Co., on the 6th instant. The former was committed by men dressed in I.R.A. uniform, which is believed, however, to have been worn only as a disguise. In the case of the bank robbery at Birr, five men suspected of complicity were subsequently arrested by the T.R.A., and handed over by them to the custody of the Royal Irish&apos; Constabulary.State of the Police Forces. The following figures show the present strength of the Irish Police Forces :- Royal Irish Constabulary.Regular Force.Strength on the 30th January, 1922   ... ... ...     13,047Deaths  ... ... ... ... ... 7RetirementsDismissals or discharges ...Recruits ...

The retirements shown above represent the disbandment of 34 members of the Veterans&apos; Division and that of 1,211 members of the Regular Force recruited in Great Britain during the past two years. The strength of the Veterans&apos; Division is now reduced to 106.Dublin Metropolitan Police.The strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Police remained unchanged through-out the week at 1,134.Railway Situation.A series of joint conferences between the representatives of the Irish Railway Companies and of the Railway Unions has been held in Dublin during the week, with the hope of effecting a comprehensive settlement of the many subjects of dispute arising from the Carrigan Award, but no public announcement has yet been made as to the progress of the discussions. Meanwhile a settlement has been reached of the engine-cleaners&apos; and coal-heavers&apos; strike at the Broaclstone Terminus of the Midland Great Western Railway, and the normal passenger and goods services of this line have now been resumed. The sectional strikes on the Southern lines still continue, however, and the counties of Cork and Kerry are now practically cut off from all railway communication with the rest of the country. The suspension of traffic has already resulted in the infliction of heavy financial loss upon the trading and business community, and in a considerable addition to the number of the unemployed. An announcement issued by the Cork Strike Committee threatens that in the event of a settlement not being reached by midnight of the 8th instant, the men will seize the railways affected by the strike and operate them independently of the Companies&apos; rights of ownership. A strike of 600 employees of the Grand Canal Company is having serious effects upon business in the Midlands, and a strike of 120 dockers
employed by the London and North-Western Railway in Dublin has resulted in the suspension of the Company&apos;s passenger steamer service between the North Wall and Holyhead.H.
