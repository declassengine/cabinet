CHURCHILL.I.-STRIKES.Statistics of Strikes for the Week ending the 1st May.During the week ending the 1st May, 3,988 working days or one-fortieth of 1 per cent, of the possible working time were lost through strikes on munition work, excluding Admiralty work. The figures have varied little during the last four or five weeks. The most serious loss of time occurred at the National Shell Factory, Newport, where 750 workers lost two days each.Statistics of Strikes for April 1918.The following table shows for the month of April the number of persons involved in strikes in each district, the total number of days lost, and the average duration of the strikes:-	Number of Work-	Number of	Average DurationUlolJ lCl..	people Involved.

The only disturbing feature is a tendency to unrest among workers in the electrical trades, and this disturbance of feeling does not relate itself directly to any grievances of substance as to conditions of employment.   Disputes which have occurred at Oldham, Chilwell, Croydon, andA   (:I3)5756   Pk 20   12;*.   5/18   R&amp;S &apos;
Woolwich, in which electrical workers have figured, have not been serious on their merits, but they have afforded opportunities for the agitator to show his hand. Feeling in these trades requires delicate treatment owing to the widespread disloca-tion which would result from stoppage and the known character of some of the men in control of the Union&apos;s policy.IL-WHITSUN HOLIDAYS.The response to the appeal to munition workers to work over the Easter holidays was excellent, and indeed almost embarrassing. It is, therefore, proposed, both as a reward for good service and also as the best means of increasing output in the long run, to permit the usual Whitsun holiday to be taken. It will be necessary to request some firms engaged on certain kinds of manufacture, the need for which is specially urgent, to work over the Whitsun holidays, but these will be only a very small percentage of the total number.III. - TRAVELLING FACILITIES FOR MUNITION WORKERS.The Ministry of Munitions at present have at their disposal 20,000 vouchers for week-end railway journeys, which are distributed among workers in controlled establishments who are living away from home. The voucher entitles the worker to a return ticket at the price of the present single fare. The Board of Trade have made a request that the number of vouchers to be issued by the Ministry should be reduced by half.For some time preference in allocating the vouchers has been given to married men who have the expense of two homes. Dissatisfaction has been caused among other workers, particularly women, who, though nominally eligible, have not been able to obtain vouchers. The proposed reduction to 10,000 vouchers a week has led to the consideration whether the issue of so small a number would not cause more dissatisfaction than otherwise ; and, partly on these grounds, but mainly on the ground of the serious increase of pressure on the railways, it has been decided to abandon the issue of these cheap tickets immediately after Whitsuntide.This will involve in future the withdrawal of a similar privilege at holiday periods. Up till now, for the purposes of holidays, the Railway Executive have agreed both to increase the number of vouchers and to extend their availabilitv to cover the period of the holiday. The same objections, however, which apply to the continued issue of these vouchers at week-ends apply also to their issue at holiday times.IV.-MUNITION WORKERS RELEASED FOR MILITARY SERVICE.The pace in recruiting munition workers is being maintained. . During .1917, 67,672 men were released in eight months (May to December 1917). From January 1st, 1918, to the end of March, 32,120 men were released to the army, and in the last five weeks over 40,000 have been released for military service. The total number of men released for military service under the Munitions Area Release Scheme since the 7th May, 1917, is thus 140,654,
