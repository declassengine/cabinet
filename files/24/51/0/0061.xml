( Heference&quot;Vat Cabinet 412, Minute 14).Note &quot;by Mr. Churchill. Ifoedless inconvenience will, arise if paragraph 14 (d) of Tar Cabinet Minute 412 of yesterdays date is literally insisted on.    At present Sir Charles LlliSg the Ministry of Iftmitions Representative in Paris,seed M. Loucheur on my behalf upon a Variety of small matters constantly requiring attention between the Ministries of Munitions and of Armament.     If filr Charles has to go and. obtain leave from Lord Derby each time he sees i * Ijoucheur on routine matters of exclusively departmental concern, businesg will be delayed and much of the advantage of the British Monitions Establishment in Paris will be destroyed. At present relations are extremely good, personal as well as official and the progress of business is frequently and sens-ibly&quot; accelerated in conseq&amp;enoe,     I trust therefore that some ruling will be given making it clear that paragraph 14 (d) does not apply to purely routine matters involving no questions of general policy or of extra or inter-departmental character..(Signed).   vriBSTOU S. CHURCHILL.Ministry of ignitions.
