SECRET * G.H.Q,First Army No, G*s. 116??       13Reference 0,AfD, 834 dated 30th April, 1918, and attached maps,&apos; I forward tho following statement on the operations of 9th April, in regard to the action of the 40th Division and 2nd Portuguese Divisions-1,      On the morning of the 9th April, the 2nd Portuguese Division held the line from east of Richebourg L&apos;Avoue - east of Neuve Chapelle -,east of Fauquissart to N*8o central, south of Petillon.      Thence tho 40th Division held the line running east by north to where their line joined that of the 34th Division east of Bois Grenier.2.      The 40th Division was-holding the Fleurbaix Section with the 119th Infantry. Brigade, and the Bois Grenier Section with the 121st Infantry Brigade, the 120th Infantry Brigade being in reserve in the Nouveau. Hondo - Sailly-sur-la-Lys area.    The 119th Infantry Brigade had the 18th Bn0, Welsh Regt.v, on their right; 13th Bn*, F.ast Surrey Regts f on the left; 21st Bn,, iviiddlosex Regt., being in Brigade Reserve in the Rouge-de-Bout area,      In the event of an attack on the Portuguese front, the Brigade in reserve was to occupy the crossing over the river Lys from Nouveau Monde to Sailly-sur-la-Lys inclusive,, and to take over the defence of the line Charred Post, H3l*a.0t0,, to Cockshy House post, n ,9 ,,b .9r9 nand to provide certain personnel for traffic control on bridges,      Two companies also were to man the Fleurbaix defences. In the event of attack on the Portuguese front, one Brigade of the Division in reserve (50th Division) was to occupy the defences from Bout de Ville to Le Drumez.3, ^   At about 4*5 a,m0 a heavy bombardment opened on the whole front from the La Bassee Canal to Boas Grenior, including heavy shelling by H.T.v dnd gas shells of back areas on this front *    This bombardment diminished in intensity about 6..o30 a-airu but increased again at 8,0 a,m*,. and was continuing when the attack developed along this front at 9 a,m.Before the main attack there was minor Infantry action, patrols and raiding parties being pushed forward under cover of the bombardment and the thick fog,At about 8 a,Bi, the enemy succeeded in occupying two small posts in the front system of the right Brigade of the 40th Division.,By about 8 a*m* the enemy appears to have gained possession of the front system on practically the entire front held by the 2nd Portuguese Division; and by about 9 a,mo had also obtained possession of the whole of the 11B&quot; line on that front.It does not appear that any serious resistance was made by the Portuguese troops,4.      Reports from Officers of the British Mission with the Portuguese Division and from Officers of the 55th, 50th and 40th Divisions, on the right, behind and on the left, respectively of the 2nd Portuguese Division, and of the Heavy Artillery behind the Portuguese front, show that by between 9 a8ms and 10 a,i., the bulk of the Portuguese troops had passed through the Lacouture - Le Drumez line (approximately thr^e miles from their front trenches), and that practically the whole of the--Portuguese troops who succeeded in withdrawing, were behind that line by 1.1 aftm0The Portuguese troops were not retiring,       They were in flight;   many without arms, some with their boots off, &quot;some half dressede    Their officers do not appear to have attempted to rally them, even after passing through the British lines:   ins ome
5,     The- sequence of events on the. front of the 40th Division on the morning of the 9th April was as follows2,00 a.m,       Patrols returned from the enemy front line which had been found deserted.4,00 a.m.       Shortly after 4 a,m. the bombardment started,5,00 a,m,       About 5,00 a,m, a raiding party of the 121st InfantryBrigade found the enemy holding the line in strength, and were unable to enter his trenches as our artillery was firing at that time on the enemy&apos;s front line,6,15 a,m,       12oth Infantry Brigade, in reserve, moved forward to a position of assembly 1,000 yards south of Nouveau Monde,6,25 a,m,        18th Bn,, Welsh Regt,, was informed by a Portuguese officer that the left front company, the one next to the 40th Division, was not being attacked, and this information was passed to the 2nd Portuguese Division.7,00 a,m.       Two companies of the Brigade in reserve manned thePleurbaix defences. About this time the enemy&apos;s barrage was seen to lift off the front system, and hostile infantry were seen advancing towards the trenches held by the left Brigade of the Portuguese,,7,30 a,m,       Machine gun post near Charred Post, N*i,a,0.0, saw enemy % advancing over the Portuguese area.   Firing from the infantry posts in the front system of the 40th Division hampered the enemy&apos;s advance past tho right flanlc.7,50 a,m.       Instructions were Issued for the 120th Infantry Brigade to occupy the line Cockshy House, 11,9 .ba9-,9, to Charred Post, immediately, and to keep in touch with the 151st Infantry Brigade of the 50th Division, on thoir right, and to maintain touch vilth the 150th Infantry Brigade which was then at Troubayard, G,19,a,8,05 a,m,       The 119th Infantry Brigade, reported that the enemy hadpenetrated some of the posts of the 18th Bn,, Welsh Hegt., but a counter-attack was being organised,.8,35 a.m,        The 13th Bn,, East Surrey Regt., reported that they had not been attacked,8,,45 a,m,        119th Infantry Brigade reported that the number of theenemy in the front posts which they had occupied, had increased,, but that the counter-attack to drive them out was proceeding, This counter-attack did not reach its objective, as the enemy was found to be advancing from the south-west into our battle zone south of Rouge-de-Bout;   it became apparent that the right flank of the 40th Division was being turned by the enemy advancing through the Portuguese Sector, and the troops making the counter-attack had to turn and face them,9,45 a,m.       The right company of the 18th Bn., Welsh Regt., reported that they had heavy casualties, and it was also reported that the enemy was making progress through the front of the left Battalion (13th East Surreys), and was seen advancing towardsWye/o3ome oases, they actually reels tod attempts by Bri^Jj^-oJMlaaa^, to cally and reorganise:   at this time the en&amp;rny was not in close pursuit, and it should have boon po&amp;ajxlc to reorganise them,    Portuguese troops in rear defences, when they found ibhose from the front were not stopping in the rear defences, also withdrew,
Prom the details given abovo, it is evident that there is no foundation fcr tho suggestion put forward in Lisbon that the Portuguese troops suffered defeat owing to the failure of the British Division. (40th) to cover their left flank.   The truth is that the Portuguese troops failed to offer any sorioua resistance, and could not be rallied. Any resistance that may have been offered was so rapidly overcome, that the right flank of the 40th Division was enveloped before reserve troops could be moved up to cover it.Thelifye Farm 11.36 .a.2 .2 *  At this time, machine gun pojBt* ttO&amp;r Oliarred Pont, li.l.a.0.0 and Windy Post, II.1.0*2*4. saw the enemy forcing their way past V*C. Corner, N.2.C.8.1, and they inflicted heavy casualties on them.    The enemy, however, pressed on along Rue Delvas, Bio Petillon, and Rue du Boist    These machine guns remained in action until all but ono had been knocked out.    The deployment of the enemy from Rue Delvas was hampered by machine gun fire from post B.2, which was about 1,000 yards south of Croix Blanc ho Post H.33.b.4.7&apos;.    Those machine guns remained in action until 2*0 p.m.   Machine gun fire from poet B.l. near Two Tree Farm N .2.0.1*6, also liaapwind the advance of tho onemy through the left of the Portuguese front.    These, machine guns remained in action until 1.30 p&apos;.m.&apos;, although they had been surrounded by the enemy for a long time before that hour.10.0 a.m. Despite the resistance offered, the enemy succeeded inmaking considerable progress in the front system of the forward zone of the 40th Division, and especially on its right flank; and at 10.15 a.m* some were reported to have reached Rouge de Eout.    About this time, two Companies of the 21st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, of the Brigade in support, on thpir way to reinforte were diverted towards Two Tree Farm, H.2.c .1.-6, and attacked the flank of the enemy who wore attacking Petillon, N.2.d, checking the enemyfs attack.10.30 a.m.        The enemy continued to envelope the right flank of tho . ,20th Battalion Middlesex Regiment from the direction of Rouge de Bout, and machine gun fire was opened on the south-west portion of Fleurbaix defences.10.40 a*m. The 120th Infantry Brigade, on their way to occupy thelino Cockshy House - Charred Post, found the enemy already in occupation of a portion of the line; and took up the lino (with the 10th/11th H.L.I.) from Middy Lane Post G.33.d.l.5. to Laventie North Post,- G.35.a.2.-2, prolonging the line thence towards Charred Post with the 14th H.L.I. The 14th H.L.I. were attacked in flank from the direction of Rouge do Bout, and the 2nd Battalion R.S.F., with a...... section of machine guns, were sent up to support them, andto prolong their loft on the general lino Laventie Worth Post, G.35.a.2.2 - Barlotto Farm, H.26.a.3.4 - Bleurbaix. All the details that could be collected were sent forward to close the gap that bad&apos;now been made in this line, but , ,  , toy were not successful in preventing the further advanco of the enemy.11.10 a.m.        At 11.10 a.m. the 50th Division reported that the 150th Brigade which had been ordered at 8.45 a.m. to proceed to Bout Deville R.23.d.8.8 - Le Drumez N.3.a.2.0 line, had . reported thoir arrival there, and that they were in touch with the 40th Division.
The Commander and Staff of the Portugese Corps are well aware that such is the case, and immediately after * the battle were conscious of the failure of their troops. The change of bone now apparent may be traced to the * message sent to the Portuguese Government by our Foreign Office and to the misleading accounts which appearod in the English and French Press.(Sgd.)
