rgfegj)jcument is the Property.^ His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Govermnent/fCQNEIDENTLAL. Political Intelligence Department,[May 11,1918.] FOREIGN OFFICE.France /001.MEMORANDUM onTHE STATE OF FRENCH PUBLIC OPINION.THE great battle which began on the 21st March had not continued a fortnight before the enemy, perhaps already doubting of a complete military success, began an attack of another kind. Count Czernin made a speech in which he declared that M. Clemenceau had, shortly before the opening of the battle, made enquiries as to whether Austria was prepared to enter into negotiations for peace, and that a friendly reply had been sent intimating the willingness of Berlin and Vienna to discuss peace, with the single reservation that the French demand for Alsace-Lorraine could not be admitted. But, he added, M. Clemenceau had declined to enter upon a discussion upon this basis. So it was obvious that there was no choice, and the great offensive had to go forward.This speech led to a series of revelations which is probably not yet concluded, and may be more conveniently discussed at a later stage. The object of the present memorandum is not to discuss the question of the Emperor&apos;s letter, or the successive peace feelers which followed upon it; but to examine the, effect of the recent con-troversy, as well as of the battle itself, upon the state of mind of the French people. It may be taken as certain that one of the objects which Count Czernin had in view was, if possible, to upset M. Clemenceau. Any political crisis in the middle of the battle would obviously be an asset to the enemy. But it is safe to say that one which drove Clemenceau from power would have a double value in German eyes. This, then, was part of the scheme: to offend one section of French opinion by exhibiting the Prime Minister as asking for peace, to offend another by showing him slamming the door abruptly in the face of the peacefully disposed Central Powers, and at the same time divide France and Italy by arousing Italian suspicions that France was ready to deal with Austria, and that Alsace-Lorraine alone, and no consideration for Italy was the single obstacle.How far has the plan succeeded? The effect in Italy does not concern us here. But so far as it aimed at disturbing France it may be said definitely that it has altogether failed. It is true that not everything which M. Clemenceau has done in the course of the controversy which followed Czernin&apos;s speech, has been universally approved in France. In particular the publication of the Emperor Charles&apos;s letter was disapproved in certain quarters, not only among the Socialists who are always anxious to attack Clemenceau, and always ready to discuss peace anywhere at any time and with anybody, but also among certain sections of the financial, clerical, and aristocratic worlds, who, for various reasons, have Austrian proclivities. No -doubt the final verdict of public opinion as a whole will not be pronounced till after the whole .story has been discussed in the Chamber. But for the present there can be little doubt that Clemenceau&apos;s position is to-day stronger than it has ever been. The brutal frankness of his reply to Czernin, the dramatic stroke of the publication of the Emperor&apos;s letter, may have been wise or unwise, but they sort with the present mood and circumstances of the country, which is more than ever conscious of being at war with a relentless and unscrupulous enemy against whom the only argument worth using is a blow.The graver the hour, the more the country has turned to Clemenceau. No doubt it would, to a certain extent, have turned to any Prime Minister who was in power. But the tone Clemenceau has adopted from the day he took office, the attitude expressed in his phrase &quot; je fais la guerre,&quot; the brevity and rarity of his speeches, the courage with which he has attacked the whole Defaitiste gang, even the great Caillaux himself on whom, people thought, no politician would dare to lay his hands, all these things have given both the nation and the army a feeling that he is the man for the crisis. So we see such significant incidents as that M. Rene Renoult, the leader of the Radical Socialist Party in the Chamber (which is no friend to Clemenceau), after having been on a visit to the army front at the same time as Clemenceau, paid a remarkable tribute on his return to Paris to the great popularity[3(57-12]&apos;
enjoyed by the Prime Minister among the soldiers. And, in face of the annoyance manifested by the Socialists and some of his own party, he repeated it emphatically a few days later, declaring that not only French soldiers, but all the peoples of the Entente looked up with admiration to the man who, against the German onrush, represented the faith and resolution of France. So again M. Debierre, a Senator and active member of the Coalition republicaine, a body formed practically to unite all the elements most hostile to Clemenceau, is forced to begin an article in the &quot; Pays &quot; with the words &quot; M. Clemenceau is popular. He is popular in the army. He is popular with the people.&quot; It would be difficult to find stronger testimony. And M. Debierre calls more important witnesses than himself. He points to the significant fact that the Conseils Geiieraux, very important bodies who represent the municipalities and communes of each Department, have, most of them, at their recent meetings passed, often unanimously, votes of confidence in the Government, and in M. Clemenceau in particular. In many cases even the Socialists concurred in these votes, though in others they protested. On the whole these important meetings do indicate, as the &quot; Temps &quot; claims, that the union sacrSe in the country as a whole is much stronger than the spirit of party allows it to be in Paris, and particularly in the Chamber. Paris, indeed, is said to have been very nervous, and in certain quarters of it dangerously near the &quot; nous sommes trahis &quot; condition, during the first alarming days of the battle. But foreign observers, with access to good means of information, describe it as now quite sound again, and in particular say that the attitude of the Conseils generaux has steadied opinion, and greatly strengthened M. Clemenceau.There have been other good signs not connected with Clemenceau person ally. The abandonment by the workmen of&quot; the usual May Day &quot;celebrations; the immediate acceptance by ail parties, including the Socialists, of the incorporation of Class 19 in the army; the admission by even the Extreme Left that &quot;before the overruling will of facts &quot; there Can be no longer any parties in France; the confessions of Socialist papers that no further trust can be put in German Socialists&apos;, the wide-spread protests which from all Quarters compelled the withdrawal of the amazing proposal to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Karl Marx; and, finally, the abandonment in the Chamber of the proposal to demand the communication of the Austrian documents to the whole House, and the frank expressions of confidence in the Government with which M. Forgeot, who had proposed this plan, accompanied its withdrawal: all &quot;these things together &quot;point to the healthiness of public opinion, and its increased determination in view of the German&apos;offensive, to do nothing to embarrass M. ClemeriCeati. ...There is no &quot;doubt also that, not&apos;drily French military pride, but also serious French opinion is pleased and reassured by the new arrangements as to the unity Cf command, and &apos;tlie. &quot;appointment &quot;of &quot;General Fdch. One canndt, unfortunately, say that there has been ihiich recognition of the generosity of the British Government and army in accepting the Change, nor &quot;any self-questioning as to whether the French would, in any circumstances, have&apos; done the same. Even Clemenceau has never had the courage to tell the Trench &quot;people plainly the truth about the difficulty and danger of that smaller part of the front held by our army as compared with the larger part held by the French. And there has been a good deal of readiness in the:press to suggest that throughout the war, and more especially in the present battle, all the success has been due tq French generalship. This vanity, however traditional in France, is unfortunate; but much should be forgiven to a country which has under-gone so much,&apos;and at this mdihent sees a large part of its soil occupied by the enemy, and another large part defended by a foreign army. And side by side with ungenerous things there have&quot; been inaliy geiierdus things in the French papers. Many of the correspondents have given enthusiastic accounts of our soldiers. One, who is with oiir:army, confesses&apos;that lie ha&apos;s&apos;ahnbyed Frenchmen,&apos;and provdked annonymou^ letters, by his unbounded praise. He says he &quot;will only give his indignant corre-spondents one ansiyer: &quot; ask any French soldier who has fought side by side with the British, and seen them.&apos;&apos; Another has a Column of tribute, at once detailed and enthusiastic to the &quot;immense&quot; effort of England &quot;; a tribute inwhich, one is; glad to see the armies in Asia and Africa, and, above all, the Fleet, receive their full share of praise. Perhaps, more digriificant still is the&apos; question&quot; asked by the &quot; Temps,&quot; in an article on the Bill raising the age of &quot;military service. The writer not.only speaks with enthusiastic;praise&apos;&apos;6f the&apos;courage and&apos;resolution of the whole English people, and of tlie sacrifice&apos; bitiTtiour-firoftrema&amp;eldy a &quot;nation &quot;which has * never been cpn-quered &quot; in accepting the&apos;command of a foreign general; but goes to the root of the
matter by asking whether French critics, who consider the English have been too complacent and easy-going, are quite sure of what their own countrymen would have been if the field of battle had been far away in unknown Lancashire or Yorkshire.Other matters in which we have come in for French praise are the Budget, con-trasting, like its predecessors, by its bold policy of taxation with French timidity in this respect; and our earnest and disinterested pursuit of peace in previous days, as proved , by Lichnowsky&apos;s pamphlet. It is true that M. Longuet, the Minority Socialist, who is Karl Marx&apos;s grandson, managed to write a. long article about the pamphlet in the &quot; Pays,&quot; without allowing his readers to get a hint that it was one prolonged tribute to the honesty of English statesmanship, an unusually dis-ingenuous performance even for him. But other papers did better: and the whole pamphlet has been published in at least two papers, and will tell its own tale.Our vigorous and practical treatment of the food problem has also; met with some recognition. Some efforts are being made to imitate it. There are bread cards in France, and regulations limiting the consumption of some other things. And the Minister of Supplies has just announced the institution of three meatless days a week. But the whole value of these regulations depends, of course, on the rigorous enforcement which has, in the past, been conspicuously absent in France. English visitors still speak, even in the last week or two, of the lavish abundance of the meals served in Paris, and of the ease with which some of the restrictions are evaded. It is a good sign that some of the French papers are taking the question seriously. The &apos;: Debats &quot; has preached a succession of sermons on the subject. More effective, or at least more certainly to the point, is the line taken by the &quot; Pays,&quot; which, to its credit, has frankly told its readers that the Allies have long treated the French as &quot; spoilt children.&quot; &quot; The Americans and English,&quot; it adds, &quot; have long ago submitted them-selves to a severe regime such as we, in France, cannot even conceive. It is intoler-able that foreigners should be able to say, as they do, that it is to Paris that they come when they want to enjoy themselves in the matters of eating and drinking. M. Boret intends that in future Frenchmen should submit themselves to the same restrictions as the Allies. That is not a great deal to ask of us.&quot; It will be interest-ing to see the new regulations at work. M. Boret has received from Parliament much larger powers than his predecessors. The test of his quality will lie in the use he makes of them.
