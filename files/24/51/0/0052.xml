SECRET,WAR CA3TOT.G,T. 4552. &quot; &quot;ITOR-ALLIED AVIATION&apos; 0OMMITT.TSBS.Memorandum by Sir Ifilliam ffeir. with gote by,Mr.Churchill,(i). Lfomorandum by Sir -/illion.r:cir.In November, 1917, on the occasion of a series of Inter-Allied Conferences held in Paris, a special Inter-Allied Aviation Conference was held with M. Duroesnil, Under-Secretary Of State for Military Aeronautics, in the Chair, and with Mr. Winston Churchill, Minister of Munitions, present.At this conference, a small Inter-Allied Aviation Committee was constituted to meet once a month in Paris to . discuss and settle questions of supply and production associated with the aviation programmes of the different Allied countries. The Committee consisted of two representatives from each country, the British representatives being Major Baird and myself.     A fairly regular series of meetings have been held, and while the total number of important decisions taken has not been very greatj they have been sufficient to justify tho maintenance of the Committee.    The most important action produced has been the presentation to the Committee monthly of the production programmes of the different countries, together with tho statements of relative strengths in the Field.As can be appreciated, it has beei somewhat dif-rieult 4;o confine the discussions to supply, production and tochnital questions, as such questions in aviation are so much bound up with policy and operations.Last week, the Supreme War Council at Versailles initiated another Inter-Allied Aviation Committee, at Which General Sykes, Chief of the AJtr Staff, and General Salmond, G.O.C. Royal Air Force in thejFieXu in France, were present. The agenda comprised items of general aviation policy, but it was found difficult to disassociate those in discussion from questions of supply and production.Under these circumstances, I recommend that the w*ar Cabinet should inform tho Supreme far Council at Versailles of thoir desire to combine the two Committees at as early a date aa possible, so that overlapping and misunderstandings may not occur.    I am strongly in favour of koeping the size of the Committoe down to the minimum number, and suggest that each country should have two representatives as in the ease of the Supply Committeo already referred to.    I suggest the British representatives should be tho Chief o&apos;f Air Staff and tho Ministry of Munitions Council Member supervising aircraft production, and that these officers should take with them officers from other Departments, such as Operations or Technical representatives in accordance with the particular subjects to be discussed.Major Baird is proceeding to Paris on Friday to attend one of the montfl^meetings of tho Supply Committee, and if tho War Cabinet would instruct a representative at Versailles to take up this matter at onoc, Major Baird could assist in bringing about the necessary arrangements.(Signed)   W. wTSIR.AIR MINISTRY. Secretary of StateHay 13th, 1918.
(ii) Note by Mr. Churchill.

I am in full agreement with the above Minute by the S. of S. for the Air. The two Committees should be combined and the representatives chosen as proposed.
