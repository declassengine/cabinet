\ Colonel I, Dally Jones258Ic-X -      TO CABIKKX, /fftft*  Maintenance of the Army in Prance,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.I circulate a memorandum by the Adjutant General on recruiting during the past year and the drafting projects of the Array together with a note by the CI,GoSa     With both of these I am in agreement and should be glad of an early decision by the War Cabinet of the points at issue^21st May, 1918,The memorandum put forward by the A.G. giving the drafting prospects of the Army shows that the situation from now till August v/ill be seriouscWe have had to reduce nine divisions in Prance to cadre divisions and to use the men released thereby as drafts for other divisions.The majority of our divisions are now below establishment and the reinforcements expected per month only amount   to about 20,000,Meantime we are being pressed by the Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces, to make up our cadre divisions and to do all in our power to prevent breaking up units which are essential for the roulement required to release French divisions.I am in entire agreement with the Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces, in his wish not to break up units at the moment or we shall not be able to keep up the battle.I have carefully examined these figures and I am confident that the only way in which it is possible to obtain men is from the following sources:-(i)     By reduction of troops now available for Home Defence, ,(ii)    From Labour and Employment companies.It would be possible to obtain the following:-fa)     &quot;A&quot; men, 4 - 5,000 jb)     &quot;Bi,&quot; (nearly &quot;A&quot; men), 20,000, ,c)    Low category &quot;Birt and MBil&quot;, 60,000,Of the above those under (a) and (b) would be used as drafts for our fighting or front-line divisions.     (c) would be used to make up cadre divisions in order that the latter might be employed on quiet parts of the French front.I see no other way of keeping our divisions in thefield.
I must, however, point out what the above means as regards Home Defence,We now have (exclusive of Ireland) **4.Home Service divisions (3 on East Coast and 1 in  *Northern Command)7 Mixed Brigadeso1 Cyclist Brlgadec6 Cyc]&amp; fc Bat \. &amp;; .1 dns,1 Cyclist Division in Thanet,8 Cyclist Battalions in Northern Command.1 Cyclist Battalion in Kent,After proposed withdrawal we should only have -4 Home Service divisicnso 1 Cyclist-Division./and the cadres at the above units selected for reduction.The situation will improve later and it would then be advisable to increase our Home De-fence force again but I am of opinion tDnat we must now take the risk of the proposed reduction,Ueantine I am taking up the question of assistance from the Volunteer Force during the period when our Home Defence force is reducedThe above does not interfere: with our draft-finding machinery and only interferes to a very limited extent with our training arrangements at Home consequent on the withdrawal of abour 30$ of the Employment companies*It must be clearly laid down that the low category ttBiH and flBiiM men are solely for employment in quiet sectors of the front.I should be glad of an early decision^(Sd,) Henry Wilson, Cij IcGoSo18th I/lay, 1918.
mmMxm by the adjutant got&amp;al to*m ARMY COUNCIL REGARDING RECRUITING DURING THE PAST YEAR AND TEE! DRAFTING PROSPECTS OF THE ARHY.PART 1.1.    On the 31st Hay,1917, the Adjutant General submitted a Memorandum on the position and prospects of recruiting to the Army Council, which was forwarded to the War Cabinet by the Secretary of State on the 7th June,1917, with a covering Minute to the effect that &quot;the War cannot be won unless our achievements include tho defeat or exhaustion of the enemy Vis military forces, and this cannot be accomplished if our military forces are not maintained at am adequate strength.&quot;In this Memorandum it was pointed out that during the preceding year the Army Council had continuously drawn the attention of the Government to the state intp which the Army was falling, and the fact that in spite of the Council1s reiterated appeals, the result up to the date of the Memorandum had been dangerously disappointing.Certain proposals wero made in the Memorandum whioh closely resemble the steps that were only taken in April,1918.It is proposed in the first place very briefly to enumerate the representations that have been made from time to time by the Army Council during the last 12 months.2.     On the 17th July, 1917&apos;, the then Secretary of State forwarded to the War Cabinet (G.T.1439), Memoranda by the Director of Recruiting and by the Adjutant General.   In those Memoranda it was clearly stated that the situation was grave in the extreme if steps were not at once taken to keep the existing forces in theatres of war within Bight of their war establishment.    It was pointed out that during June, 1917, on account of the urgent call for men, 25,000 men who had been sick cr wounded were taken from reserve and training units before they would ordinarily have been passod fit, and that the situation at the time of writing domanded further large drafts from Command Depots and Convalescent Hospitals, a policy forced upon the Army Council by the shortage of healthy and fully trained recruits.   It was also noted that from January to June, 1917, the number of general service men recruited each month was insufficient even to replace the ordinary wastage, irrespective of heavy fighting.    A reference was also made tc the drain upon the rapidly diminishing man-power of the Army by civil and industrial departments.3.     On the 18th August, 1917, the Secretary &apos;of&quot; State forwarded a Memorandum by the Adjutant General (G.T.1772) calling attention to the fact that during the month of July,1917, the intake in the number of recruits was the lowest by ever 20,000 of any month (up to date) in 1917, and urging that it was &apos; imperative that seme drastic action should be taken to increase the influx of recruits,4.     On the 6th October,1917, in forwarding the monthly returns for Recruiting to the Secretary of the ^ar Cabinet, the Adjutant General attached a Memorandum showing the seriousaspect
aspect cf the position, especially in regard to the falling off of the number of the 18 year old boys, and indicating the departments by which the bulk of these youths were protected.5.     On the 19th November,1917, in forwarding the monthly State of the Army to the Secretary of the War Cabinet, the, Adjutant General wrote a semi-official lettor pointing out that the average monthly wastage in all theatres of war between April and   &quot;September, 1917, had been 67,190.     A comparison between this figure and the Monthly Recruiting figures forwarded with the semi-official note requires no further explanation.6.     On the 10th November, 1917, a lengthy Hemorandum was prepared by direction of the Secretary of State and the 0*1*0*3* setting forth the present and future position of the Army in regard&quot; to men.    Shortly it amounted to this:   that by the 31st October,1918, there would be a deficit of 219,000 Infantry in France alone.     The deficit in Infantry in all theatres of war was at the date of writing 95,000.   It was then calculated that up to the 1st April,1918, 15,000 men each month would become available from Hospitals in &quot;France, a figure which has since proved to be optimistic.    The Memorandum went on to urge that in order to bring the Infantry in the Field up to establishment and to have th*2 necessary reinforcements available, 250,000 Category &quot;A&quot; recruits over the age of 18 8/12 were required during the month of November, 1917, and a monthly intake of 50,000 Category MAW recruits during the months December,1917, to J&quot;une, 1918, inclusive.(gOJ2*   Owing to the reduction ef the number of battalions rTn divisions from 12 to 9, these figures were subsequently reduced to 2X1,000 Category &quot;A&quot; recruits over 18 8/12 years&quot; of age to be xcund during December,1917, and 38,700 per month afterwards.)It was further pressed that immediate Parliamentary action dhauld be taken to save the situation.7.     On the 15th November,1917, when the reinforcement of the&quot; Force in Egypt was under consideration, the attention of the CI.G.3, was called to the faot that if the policy then indicated in regard to Egypt was to be pursued, and the proposed foroe in that Country, including the consequential expansi on of the Lines of Communication, was to bo maintained from December, 1917, te Kay,1918, there would only be left available for theatres of war other than Egypt up to 31st May,1918, some 150,000 men.   This would work out at about 25,000 per month, a figure less than half that required to meet the normal wastage in Prance, where at&apos; that time there was an existing deficit of 48,000 men.    The C*X*G*S. brought this to the notice of the &quot;War Cabinet.8.    About the 18th November,1917, the C.I.0.3. submitted to the Cabinet a Secret Memorandum on the military situation in which the facts and requirements enumerated in the Adjutant General&apos;s Memorandum of the 10th November,1917, w.*ee briefly summarised.9.    On the 24th November,1917, the Secretary of State forwarded a Note representing the views of the &quot;ftar Office in connection with the Memorandum on the problem of the Maintenance of the Armed Forces&quot; drawn up by the Minister of National Service on the 15th November,1917.    In this note it was pointed out that since the presentation of the Memorandum of the Adjutant Genoral dated the 31st Hay,1917, the Recruiting figuresboth
both of men for General Service and of those for ether Categories had steadily declined.    figures were given, identical with those referred to in the Adjutant General&apos;a Memorandum of the 10th November,1917, and the note concluded by affirming that the situation demanded immediate action, either in the direction of admitting that the country was unable to maintain the forces then in the field, and the consequent reduction of those forces within the limits of our available man-power, or such steps on the part of the Government aB would at once make good the existing deficit, and enable the Armies to be maintained during the coming year.10.   On the 29th November,1917, the Secretary of State forwarded for the information of the War Cabinet a letter, dated the 24th November,1917, from the Field Marshal, Commanding-in-Chief in France, bearing upon the note from the War Office,dated the 24th November, 1917.     The conclusions arrived at by the field Marshal were practically identical with those formed by the Army Council.11.   On the 3rd December,1917, in reply to an invitation by the prime Ministor that the Army Council should submit their concrete proposals as to how men were to be obtained, the Secretary of State forwarded a Memorandum by the Army Council pointing out the various occasions on which the attention of the Government had been drawn by the Council to the unsatisfactory state of recruiting, and emphasizing the Councils agreement with the Memorandum of the Minister of National Service (G.174), on which no action had, up to the date of writing, been taken.   The Council further ampnaslsed the numbers cf men that were being drawn out from the Army for various occupations, and concluded by expressing their inability to make further proposals without intruding into the realms of politics.    It was further suggested that Ireland was practically an untapped source from which recruits might be obtained.12.   On the 15th December,1917, the Adjutant General addressed a personal Memorandum to the Secretary of State, the contents of which he gave to tho Cabinet Committee on Man-Power during his attendance at that Committee.The arguments which had been advanced against taking legislative action for the provision of men were mainly -(a) th8 fact that the Allies were shown to be numerically stronger than the Central Powers; and(b) that the morale of the German troops was on the decline.The Adjutant General pointed out that many cf the Allied troops were of very inferior quality if pitted against the Germans, that our men on the Western front were becoming &quot;cold&quot; with incessant fighting, and that new units and drafts had to he used up before they had been thoroughly trained, while cur numerical inferiority precluded out troops from obtaining the rest that was all essential to efficiency.    The Adjutant General suggested that whatever information might have been obtained in regard to the deterioration of enemy morale, it did not coincido with what he had heard from regimental and staff officers at the front.He piinted out that the discipline of the Army at Home, more especially in Command Depots, was being visibly affected by the shortage of men, and that Commandere-in-Chief at home were insistent in their anxiety on this point.&quot;flhile
While excusing himself from touching on the province of the General Staff, he felt it his duty to point out that unless men were provided, and provided quickly in numbers sufficient to bring units in the field up to establishment and keep them so, the discipline of the Army, whether at home or abroad, would suffer to an extent which would make it douTptful whether they would hold their own for long against heavy pressure.13.   About this time the &quot;Revised Draft Report of the War Cabinet Committee-on Kan Power&quot; (0.185) was circulated, and on 7th January,1918, the military Kembera of the Army Council submitted s Ilemorandum (G.T.3255) thereon to the War Cabinet. In this Memorandum the Military Members regretted to notice that in the conclusions arrived at, only 100,000 Category MAtt men ever 18 8/12 years of age would be allocated to the Army during the forthcoming year as against 615,000 estimated by the Hilitary Authorities as being required to keep the field Armies up to establishment-   It was emphasized that there was nothing in the experience of this War or any other to support the argument that a defensive policy entails    fewer losses than an offensive policy, a criticism which has been more than justified during the last twe months.     It was pointed out that the estimate of wastage on which the War Office had worked for the past two years depended upon the intensity of the fighting. Incidentally the figures then produced have lately been fully borne out, in contradiction to those on which the Cabinet Committee arrived at its conclusion.It was further stated that on the 1st Jamiary.1910, the deficit in all theatres of &quot;rar was 130,000 men, and it was calculated that even after the reduction cf the number of battalions in Divisions in Prance and Italy from 12 to 9 batta?4.ions, there might still be a deficiency in those two theatres of war alone   of -IOOjOOO on 1st April,1918. 140,000 on 1st July, 1918.increasing up to the end of the year.    Further, that unless men were provided in sufficient numbers, it would be necessary to break up 10 Divisions, and the Hilitary Members suggested that there was no justification for accepting the statement at the end of paragraph 71 of the Proceedings of the Committee.14.   On the 14th January, 1918, a Memorandum was forwarded by the Secretary of State (H.P.C.29) drawing attention to the differences of opinion between the War Office and Ministry of National Service in regard to the estimates of men required for 1918.    Without going into detail, the events of the last five months have proved the practical correctness of the War Office figures and calculations.15.   On the 11th March,1918, a Memorandum on drafts was submitted by the Adjutant General, and concurred in by the Army Council (G.T.3902)   in which attention was drawn to the unsatisfactory position resulting from the small numbers of men recruited during the months cf   January and February, 1918, a fact which in spite of the abnormally light wastage during those months, would rebound to the disadvantage of the Army later in the year.     It was pointed out that the numbers of men who became fit after being sick and wounded had not reached even the Army Council&apos;s estimate, which was much lower than that of the  Sinister of National Service.     A surplus of 40,000 infantry existed in Prance on the date of this Memorandum, due to the reduction of Divisions from 12 to 9 battalions, of this surplus 12,000 were being utilized to meet the inorease in the Machine Gun Corps.The
The Council again reaffirmed their opinion that if heavy fighting on the Western front commenced during the month of March, tho infantry in France would at the   end of April he 43,000 under strength, to meet which deficit there would &quot;be, short of drafting men overseas &quot;before they attained the age of 19 years, no available trained infantry.The actual deficiency in Infantry in France at the end of April,1918,.was 51,272.   But had not 55,000 youths under 19 years of age been drafted several months before it had been calculated they would mature as drafts, the above deficiency would have been correspondingly increased.16.   On the 29th March,1918, the Adjutant General addressed a Memorandum to the Army Council, a copy of which was sent to the Minister of National Service, indicating the number of men of fighting arms necessary to maintain the Forces in the Field.   A Balance Sheet attached thereto estimated the deficit on the 31st July,1918, as amounting to 252,200.17*   On the 1st April,1918, the Adjutant General presented to the War Cabinet-a Memorandum, giving briefly the situation, which was - that from 21st March up to id.anight of the 30-31st March,1918, the total actual casualties of the Infantry and Machine Gun Corps were 122,000, which it was calculated would increase during heavy fighting by 20/000 a day.     The number of drafts to replace these casualties ordered since 21st March were 101,000, including 56,000 under 19 years of age.   In addition to these, some 20,000 would be available up to the end of April, after which there would be no source from which drafts could be supplied ever and above the few thousand men who would normally become available monthly, either on completion of training or on recovery from wounds or sickness.     Some 9,000 B.i men have also been despatched tc France from Reserve battalions at Home.18.   On the 18th April,1918, the Military Service Act, 1918, became law.19.   The above facts deal entirely with the man-power situation as it affects the 0cribatant services, but in addition, the situation of the Labour units has for some time given cause for anxiety.    A Memorandum by the Adjutant General is in the hands of the Secretary of State to the effect that unless effective steps are taken, the amount of white and coloured labour considered necessary tc maintain the Forces in France will have diminished in the  Autumn by nearly a half, with, under present circumstances, no prospect of replenishment.
20.      The number of men Whom the Army Council stated on November 20th, 1916 (&quot;Jar Cabinet 30th November, 1916; to be required to maintain tho existing forces in the fiold during 1917, wa3 800,000 men of Category &quot;A&quot;, and the following tabla 3hov/s the numbers demanded in each month with the numbers supplied:*Demanded, Supplied.January 1917   100,000; 51,131,February   M     120,000 , 75,930,iiarch        ,J     130,000 , 75,44 6,April        *     120,000, 55,857,Hay w     100,000, 56,893,June &quot;      80,000, 41,879,July w      65,000, 32,267,August      &quot;       50,000, 26,038,September 11      35,000, 21,455,October    &quot;        Nil, 21,150800,000. 460,045,or a deficiency of 339,955.21.      Consequent upon the failure of Recruiting to provide the HAM men required, it was necessary to reduce the Infantry in the Divisions in France from 12 to 9 Battalions.The Army Council informed the \7ar Cabinet Committee on Man-power in December 1917 the numbers of nAn men over 18 who would be required to maintain theforces in the field, after this reduction of Battalions.The actual numbers so deiiianded, together with those actually recruited are shown in the following Table &quot;A&quot;.TABLE &quot;A&quot;Demands, Supplied,November 1917 211,000, 17,928,December     &quot; 38,700, 13,730,January   1918 38,700, 18,906,February    M 30,700, 20,402,March         &quot; 38,700, 20,069,April          M 38,700, 65,929.404,500 156,964.On this basis 404,500 men of Category &quot;A&quot; of 18 8/L2 should have been posted between tho beginning of November and tho end of April, 1918.    Of these only 156,964 wore actually posted, making a doficiency of 247,530.22.      In December 1917 the ./ar Cabinet Committee had before them tho various estimates made by tho statistical branches of the minister of National Sei-vice and tho Adjutant General^ departments.One
One of the points of difference &quot;between tho estimates of the Minister for National Service and those of the Adjutant General was that the representative of the Minister of National Service &quot;before the Smuts Conedt tee contended that as the British Army would be on the defensive tho percentage cf wastage for casualties would be considerably leas than during the period when the British Army was on the offeneive.Tho actual results of the fighting ainoe the 21st iiaroh 1918, do not bear out this contention.A further difference of opinion between the twt) estimates arose on the numbers of sick and wounded men who would become fit again for General Service.    The total numbers of such men in England were estimated by the Adjutant General to be 10,600 per month, and experience proves this to be an over-estimate to the extent of noarly 1,000 a month during the period January 1st to 1st May 1918; consequently the contention of the Minister of National Service that a higher figure should have been given under thiB heading is falsified by rosultB*It is certainly unsafe to calculate in the future that idore than 14,000 men per month from the sick and wounded evacuated to England will become fit again to proceed overseas.    This reduced estimate is based upon the reduction of the forces in Prance as shown in Part III, and on the faot that during the recent fighting a very large proportion of tho casualties were missing and prisoners.Another contingency must not be ignored, i*e,9 that in meeting further heavy attacks it may well happen that a oortain number of sick and wounded will be left in the enemy1s hands, a^ain making a reduction upon the numbers who would be likely to &quot;become fit again to prooeed to Franoe,
PART XII23.      The forecast of the Minister of National Servtoe fore-shadows the posting of 67,000 Category &quot;A&quot; recruits &quot;between 18 8/L2 and 43 years of age in May 1918, and 78,000 in June, 1918.The attached Table marked UB&quot; has been sompiled OH THE ASSUMPTION&quot; THAT NO DRAFTS CAN BE PROVIDED TO IffiET INFAtfm RE0JJIR3MENTS IN THEATRES OF \7AR OTHER THAN FRANCE. On this basis it is estimated as shown in the Table that:-(a) In July 1918 there will only be sufficientmen in the Army at home and overseas to admit of the Infantry of a maximum number of J38 British Divisions being maintained in France at full strength.(b) There is no prospect until September 1918of an increase in this number of Divisions.(o) By the end of October 1918 it may be possible to increase the number of Divisions up to as many as J53.(d)   If recruiting in Ireland reaches-a figure cf 35,000 per month, commencing In June, and that fi^are is maintained monthly up to a total of 150,000, it may be possible to reach a total of 37 British Divisions in October 1918, and 42 by the end of December 1918 and maintain them for a few months.24.      Prom Table &quot;B&quot; it will be seen that by the and of July 1918 it is estimated that there will only be about 250 British battalions at full strength in France, and it will consequently be neoessary in the near future to reduce to cadres 18 Divisions at least, in addition to the 9 already so reduced.    Of the 27 depleted Divisions it should be possible by Ootober to re-create at least 8*25.      From December 1918 onwards it is assumed that the normal intake of &quot;A&quot; recruits received at 18 years of age and the sick and wounded who become fit again for General Service will remain the only source of supply; consequently it will be necessary to deplete or reduce to cadre one Division at least per month until Buch time as the above supply will meet average drafting requirements.     This point would appear&apos;to be arrived at when we have reduced the Army in France to about 17 or IB-Divisions, or, if recruiting is successfully opened at once in Ireland, to about 19 or 20 Divisions.26.      By breaking up units of other arms in the Divisions where Infantry has already been reduced to cadres, a corresponding number of drafts would thereby be released from those other arms, and consequently the recruits-available for posting to Infantry might be increased.   This break up of other arms in Divisions is therefore cne of the guiding factors in fixing the rate at which the Infantry of Divisions must be reduced to cadree.
27.      Another guiding factor will ho the method adopted in allotting American Infantry to British formations.Assuming that 150 Battalions of Infantry from America will be forthcoming by the end of July 1918 with the necessary reinforcementa. it would mean that in order to place one American battalion in each Brigade, 50 Divisions will have to be maintained with British Infantry at only half strength, of say 465 per battalion.    As an alternative the British battalions in each Brigade might be reduced to 2 battalions per Brigade of a strength of approximately 700 each for 50 Divisions.It should be noted that in the foregoing statement the figures given deal only with France, and make no allowance for reinforcements of British Infantry being s nt to other theatres of 7ar and THAT CONSEQUENTLY THE BRITISH IFFANTRY IN THOSE THEATRES MUST ULTIMATELY BECOME SO SERIOUSLY DEPLETED AS TO BE OF NO FIGHTING VALUE.
