Mr. ,(This Document is the Property of   -^c^.His Britannic !;*&apos; i*-&apos;&apos;V&apos;A Government)Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMED,    IRELAND.JLy$jiao^andum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;sMinute of 17th March, 1917.VJeek ended 15th May,    1918.The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ire land:-Tillage   Defaulters.Inspections continue to be made in cases in which occupiers have not yet satisfied the Department that the prescribed areas have V^en cultivated on their holdings,Loans for Agricultural Implements.Twenty-six applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered frcm the beginning of the pre-sent year to date, under the Soheme, amounts to  31,818.Progress of Tillage OperationsThe oat and wheat crops are reported to have suffered in many districts from insect attacks.   The recent favour-able change in the weather and the counteracting measures adopted by farmers will, it is expected, obviate serious damage.   The Departments County Agricultural Staff are active in advising farm-era as to the treatment of attacked fields.Potatr   Spraying,Detailed instructions have boen issued to tho Departments Instructors and Overseers as to the steps to be taken by them to ensure the thorough and effective spraying of the potato crop in every distrfcot.   Spocial attention has been directed to the following among other points:-16/5/18
1. Urging farmers to give their orders for materials immediately, and en-oouraging traders to stock supplies,29   Instructing farmers in the preparation of spraying mixtures,3,   Instructing and assisting farmers in the repair of spraying machinery,4,   Testing materials for purityArrangements have already been made by the Department to ensure that an adequate supply of spraying machines and materials will be availablo for the season&apos;s requirements,,FLAX,It appeals that attacks of flax beetle have been very general, and in most districts there are oases in which the brairds have suffered so severely that it ha3 been ficund necessary to re-sort to a second sowing of the crop.   Early sown flax, more es-peoially where old seed of poor germinating quality was used, has suffered most from this pest,   The extent .of failures in proportion tc the total area sown will xnxa not be largo, though most of the early sown flax has been severely checked in growth.   The attack was very much favoured by cold, dry, bright weather,   Damp, dull weather has now intervened, and if this condition continues for a few days no further serious damage need be anticipated and all brairds which have survived the attawk will probably recover.In some cases the cause of failure has been due solely to bad seed.Apart from, the attack/ of the flax beetle, the weather up to last week was unfavourable for the growth of flax brairds. This phase in itself may not, however, affect to any oxtent the prospects of the crt&apos;p0As a result jf investigations of accounts of flax-seed merchants, proceedings for breaches of the Sale of Flax-Seed (Ireland) Order, 1918, have been instituted in eleven oasos.iTransit of Farming   Requisites.The Departments Transit Branch continue to deal with the numerous representations received in regard to the con-veyance of agricultural implements and machinery.Maintenance of Live Stock.During the period from 7th to 13th May, inclusive, 450 applications for licences to slaughter animals under the.
