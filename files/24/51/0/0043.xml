WAft CABINET. 0,T.4643*WAR    CABINET,THY Off HEALTH*UQTB J Y^THS :&quot;SSCl^AKY^t^rSC(ft lahd. OH THETOUTED(See also GUT,4455 and G,T.4S3o).(1) X am in general sympathy with the provisions of theBill o(2) I ara strongly of opinion, however, that the require-ments of Scotland are not sufficiently met,   The Bill proposes (clause 3) to glace the Scottish Insurance Commissioners under the direction of the-Secretary for Scotland, and to place that Minister on tho Notional Health Insurance Joint Committee,    This is tho minimum necessitated by the other provisions of the Bill, since tho abolition of the Joint Committee in its existing form must be followed by a recon-stitution of that body.   3o far so good.    But the Bill should go further, and do for Scotland what it does for England, i.e. set up a Ministry of Health combining inter alia the func-tions of tho existing Local Government&quot;^oarFTor Scotland and Insurance Commissioners for Scotland.    The demand for such &amp; Lliniatry which is made in England is parallelled in Scotland, and I cannot afford to overlook the difficulties that would arise if the situation were dealt with in England and left as it stands aoross the border.   To put it plainly, the Bill only deals with the Scottish question to the extent to whioh, from the English standpoint, the Bill would bo incomplete if it failed to do so.    I should find it very * difficult to meet Parliamentary and other Scottish criticism taking its stand upon that argument,    I do not think the difficulties in the way of the neoeseary legislation arc any greater in Scotland than in England, and I should regret to lose the stimulus derived from inclusion in a Bill covering both countries.(3) If it be argued that tho inolusion of Scotland willincrease the difficulty in passing the measure, I think that is a mistaken view.     It would, in any case, be bettor to in-elude Scotland in the Bill in the first instance;   its pro-, visions would then bo both fair and symmetrical,    If I am wrong in my opinion, the Scottish clause can be dropped in Committee and the English situation will remain intact*   I do not consider that there7 is any necessity for further en-quiry as regards Scotland.(4) I append to this Memorandum the draft of a clauseapplying the Bill to Sootland, whioh I submitted to the Minister of Reconstruction Isst month.    It v?ill be observed that tho last subsection of tho clause proposes the appoint-raent of a Parliamentary Under Secretary to the Secretary for Scotland, and a change, which I consider long overdue, in the
status of that Minister.    The demand from Scotland for a Ministry of Health includes a demand for additional Mill tutorial representation in Parliament, and. at least under existing conditions, the method proposed in tho clause seems to bo the only way of meeting that demand.( )       As regards the points raised by Mr. Hayes Fisher In his Memorandum, X find myself in general agreement with his arguments.     I am afraid that the constitution of a Consultative Council of the type suggested would&apos;load to divided oounsolu and deprive the Minister of tho authority which he ought to possess.    I oannot imagine a more unhappy position than ho would occupy if tho Council had tho same aocoea to Parliament as he himoelf must possess.    X also agifoo that it would bo better  to omit paragraph 1, of the 3?Jret SehOdulo, for the reasons et&amp;ted by Mr. Hayes Fisher. I feel even more strongly than ho does, in regard to the title of the new department.    Health administration is a  &amp;afgo part of local government, but only a part, and, $$$$rt&amp;nt though it is, to emphasise its importance by Witting all reference to Local Government in the title of the Hiniotry, would, in my opinion, be hailed by all the Pftbtia bodies eo&amp;prisad under the general heading of &quot;Looal Authorities&quot; with something like consternation.    T3here, they would ask, are tho other functions of Local Government t$ bo controlled?    Arc Town Councils and County Councils to bo ousted locally from their position, on tho centra! analogy?    I cannot but think that this is a point deserving tho most oar^ful consideration.Scottish Office. 14th May, 1918.
