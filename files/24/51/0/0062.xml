(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAflNIC MAJESTY&apos;,S GQVIRMMEIIT),COAL t SITUATION   Iff   .FRAKCE.Report by Hajor General Sir P.A*M.irHash. tciyouTated for reformation)(See also G.T.4130, G.T.4176, G.T.4234, G.T.4248, G..T..4273, and 6.T.4383.)The Secretary,British Section,Supreme V/ar Council.As you are- aware,, an agreement has recently been made, by which additional imports of coal from England are to be made to France in replacement of coal raised in the pas de Calais mines.   This agreement has been concluded in fulfilment of the instructions I received from the V/ar Cabinet, vide War&apos; Cabinet Minute Bo. 395 of April, 1918.On the 10th instant, Captain PLETRY called-on me on behalf of bonsieur LOUCHEUR, and informed me that no shipments under the recently made agreement had yet been made, and that his representatives in England informed him that the reason for the delay was that coal was not available in England for export, and not on account of the absence of shipping.Capt, BLETRY informed me that deliveries of coal from the pas do Calais mines for consumption South of the Sommc had, during the previous month, been very greatly reduced due to the impossibility of using the railways for this purpose.   As tho w&quot;ar Cabinet are no doubt aware, practically all the railway capacity across the Somme has been absorbed by military traffic, to the exclusion of the coal traffic which formerly was handled, and which was essential for economic purposes in France.   I have since received figures from Capt. BLETRY which show that from the 26th Karen to tho 30th April only 134,000 tons of coal from the Pas de Calais mines were railed South of the Somme, as against a requirement of 600,000 tons.   There has therefore been a deficit during that period of 446/000 tons of coal of French quality, which under the agreement recently come to should have been replaced by British coal.   The quantity of coal of British quality required for this purpose is 401,000 tons.As the War Cabinet will realise, the agreement alluded to has only recently been concluded, and there has hardly been time to bring it into full execution, but the position of coal reserves in Franco is such that unless shipments of British coal to replace Pas de Calais coal are instituted forthwith, a critical situation must arise.I am particularly anxious with regard to stocks of coal held on the railways in Francer Tho reserves held arc by no means high, as will he seen from the following figuresSECRET,W A R   CABINET,155G,T,-4562.Reseau de 1&apos;Est, Reseau de 1&apos;Etat Reseau du Midi.,38-g- days&apos; consumption.27      &quot; nRoseau du P.L.M.

The amount of military traffic now being handled in Prance is very groat indeed, and will increase with the growth of the American Army; and in ray opinion the reserves of ooal, details of which arc given above, do not afford a margin sufficient to give complete security,    A period of intense military traffic such as was experienced between Karon 25th and April 10th would materially reduce the amount of coal hold in reserve.The reserves of coal for other than railway purposes in France arc, I am informed by tho Minister of Armaments, &quot;cry low, and during the last month have suffered reduction by some 400,000 tons, due to tho loss of coal from the Pas dc Calais mines which has not be replaced from Great Britain.   Cayt. BL&amp;TBY informs ate that, unless the export of coal from Great Britain to Prance is increased at once, the reserves of coal for other than railway purposes will not be sufficient&apos; to meet requirements, and there must be a diminution in supplies of coal for railway purposes, which will have the effect of reducing the railway reserves.In my opinion it is impossible to reduce the amount of traffic now being handled by the French Hallways,   Already civil and&apos; industrial traffic has been cut down to a minimum, and military traffic cannot be reduced without immediately affecting the efficiency of the Armies.    The situation therefore appears to mo to be of such importance as to warrant special measures being taken to ensure the export of coal from Great Britain to Franco being increased without delay, and X am of opinion that the War Cabinet should be put in possession of the facts of the situation, which will, in my opinion, become critical unless strong measures are taken at once.I wired direct to the Coal Controller in London on the 10th instant, telling him of the result of my interview with Capt, BLIW.(Sd.)   P.A.K, 1TASH.Major-General, British Representative, Versailles, Intor-Alliod Transportation Council13th May, 1918.
