Majefty&apos;8 Government.)34port for Week ending Wednesday, May 8, 1918.MINISTET  OF  FOOD.PART I.-ACTION TAKEN.In the House of Lords, on 8th May, on the motion of the Lord Privy Seal (the Earl of Crawford), the Defence of the Realm (Food Profits) Bill was read a second time and set down for Committee of the Whole House on Tuesday of next week.In the House of Commons, on 6th May, the second reading of the Defence of the Realm (Beans, Peas, and Pulse Orders) Bill was carried by a majority of 134 votes to 23. Mr. Clynes pointed out that it was an abuse of language to apply the term &quot; sanctity of contract &quot; to wild speculations in foodstuffs at a time of severe shortage-carried out to a considerable extent by persons wholly without trade interests. He added that it was not the desire of the Department to impose any losses upon those those who, in the ordinary course, were engaged in legitimate trade at the time.In view of the interest expressed in Parliament and the Press with reference to the report of the Sub-Committee on the Government control of the wholesale distribu-tion of milk, the scheme as reported to Major Astor&apos;s Committee is set out, subject to such modifications as may be recommended by the parent Committee : (1) The objects to be aimed at are the maintenance of the milk supply, the economical handling of milk, its equitable distribution, and the full utilisation of surplus supplies for manufacturing purposes. (2) For the purposes of controlling the distribution of milk Great Britain shouldbe divided into suitable areas. (3) Milk Superintendents should be appointed in each area to take charge of the local distribution of milk and to act under the instructions of the Central Authority in London, with a separate Advisory Committee for Scotland, meeting in Edinburgh, and under the Central Authority in London.   They should have access to the statistics and information in the Live Stock Commissioner^ possession. (4) A National Milk Clearing House should be set up in London which should control the wholesale milk trade of the country, and employ persons, firms, or societies who are licensed to deal in milk by wholesale as authorised wholesale milk agents as far as is necessary. (5) The Clearing House should take over existing contracts between wholesalers and producers, but would interfere as little as possible with direct con-tracts between producers and retailers.   Such contracts would, however, be subject to the supervision and the approval of the Milk Superintendent for the area in which the retailer may be situated. (6) All milk churns in the possession of wholesale dealers other than retail delivery churns Avould be taken over and become the property of the Clearing House.(7) Manufacturers whose primary business is the manufacture of milk products would be authorised to act as wholesale agents of the Clearing House and would be required to manufacture dried milk, cheese, or other products, on account of and in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing House.(8) In the organisation of the wholesale trade during the war, the power of wholesale traders may be strengthened or in some cases disorganised for the period after the war. It is therefore recommended that in con-stituting traders agents of the Ministry of Food, the Government should at once obtain an option to purchase the businesses of such traders at a fair valuation to be arrived at by negotiation or by arbitration, as experience may show the ultimate necessity of the State becoming the sole wholesaler of milk, a development which this Committee considers to be desirable.(9) It should be the policy of the Clearing House to encourage producers to form themselves into co-operative associations for the purpose of improving the conditions of milk production and for the manufacture of cheese.A  (33)5683-2  Pk 1   130  5/18  E&amp;S .

(10) It is recognised that milk should be produced and supplied under improved conditions so that it may be more clean and wholesome when it reaches the consumer. Any improvements that can be effected, by grading or otherwise, should be made in such a way as to anticipate the lines of future requirements..The Sub-Committee is of the opinion that the most suitable locations for the establishment of new milk depots cannot be properly determined in the absence of the knowledge that can only be obtained by the exercise of full control over the wholesale trade.The Report will not be published until it has been carefully considered by this Department;The Food Survey Board recommend that, although the meat ration for troops at Home Stations has been reduced from 10 ozs. to 8 ozs., a further reduction be made in the case of soldiers engaged in sedentary occupations. They also recommend that the scale laid down for sick and wounded German prisoners of war should not exceed the scales adopted in workhouse infirmaries.The Food Hoarding Order has been amended in view of the decision of the Ring&apos;s Bench Division to the effect that tea is not a food.   The new clause reads :  &quot; For the purpose of this Order, the expression &apos; article of food&apos; shall &apos; mean every article which is used for food by man, and every article which ordinarily enters into or is used in the composition or preparation of human food, and shall include tea, coffee, and cocoa.&quot;Control of Supplies and Prices.- Allied Requirements. Lord Rhondda has received the following cablegram from Mr. Hoover, through Mr. Sheldon: &quot; Please inform Lord Rhondda that I am entirely in accord, with the views expressed by him in his cable to Lord Reading of March 18th. Our reduction in wheat consumption now amounts to 60 per cent, of normal and will, I believe, hold until harvest. This should permit our continued shipment of present programme in flour until July 1st. We can maintain a very large meat programme steadily. After July 1st we will have a bad period in wdieat until new harvest is generally available about middle September, although we hope to maintain some shipments. Present harvest prospects here, France, and Italy, if realised will permit relaxation all bread restrictions except possibly dilution and even this might be reconsidered if harvest proves its maximum possibilities.&quot;Lord Rhondda has replied as follows : &quot;Many thanks for your cable received, through Sheldon. I am relieved to hear of the improved outlook and congratulate you most heartily upon the success of your untiring efforts on behalf of the Allies. Rhondda.&quot;In reply to an enquiry as to whether the United States could provide additional supplies of frozen beef to fill refrigerated tonnage which is likely to become avail-able in June, Sir Guy Granet cables that Mr. Hoover informs him that the U.S. Food Administration would be willing to take drastic action by enforcing meatless days and by restricting the supply by packers to their own trade, in order to provide in June 42,000 tons of frozen beef in addition to the regular monthly supply of 32,500 tons, and a further , additional 4-2,000 tons before the end of August.Sir Guy Granet has . been authorised to proceed with the purchase of the remaining 124,000 tons of bacon, hams, and lard previously offered by Mr. Hoover. In reply to an enquiry as to whether there is any prospect of reduction in the present high prices of these commodities, Sir Guy Granet cables that the United States Food Administration consider it advisable that hogs should be kept about the present level in order to encourage production, and that in view of the increased cost oi labour and materials there is no prospect of lower prices.The Treasury have approved requirement of the Ministry of Food in meat, fats, and oils imports through Sir Guy Granet, at 75,282,430 dollars for June, and 54,178,430 dollars for July.Ocean clearances for the week ending April 27th of purchases on behalf of the Ministry of Food other than cereals and sugar amounted to 35,050 net tons.

Bacon, Earns, and Lard. Some improvement in transport lias been effected, and a suggestion that coasting steamers should, be used for transport between ports is under consideration. The causes of delay in clearing the quays at Liverpool are being investigated.The Irish Food Control Committee find that there are small surplus supplies which may be exported from Ireland to Great Britain, and anticipate that such export is likely to be continuous.Butter. During the week ending May 4th, 825 tons of butter has arrived from Australia, 762 tons from the Argentine, 482 tons from the United States of America, 10 tons from- France, and 30 tons from South Africa, making a total of 2,109 tons. The amount on passage on May 4th was 23,221. tons, and the stocks in hand 9,617 tons.On Monday, 13th May, the fortnightly distribution of butter will be made, amounting to 25 per cent, of the applications, for the month of May.. Cheese. Advice has been received of further shipments of 102 tons of old season Canadian cheese ; 384 tons of cheese has arrived from the United States of America, and there are 1,991 tons on passage ; the unshipped stock amounts to 6,474 tons.Meat. An Order has been issued amending the Edible Offals (Maximum Prices) Order, 1918, by revising the schedules of prices, and including certain offals not previously controlled, of which the principal are beef and mutton raw fats.The Live Stock (Sales) Order consolidates various Orders dealing with the sale and slaughter of live stock, and carrying out arrangements recently made with the Board of Agriculture and representatives of the farmers. It provides that cattle and sheep for slaughter may be sold by dead weight at the vendors option with the concurrence of the Area Live Stock Commissioner. The dead weight prices, which include the value of the offals and are calculated on the certified dressed weight of the carcase, are, for cattle Is. 2\d. per lb., and for sheep Is. 2\d. per lb., plus the market value of the skin, less the sum of \d. per lb. The seller will be entitled to a reasonable opportunity of checking the weight of the carcase.The Order also empowers the Food Controller to prescribe the markets in which cattle, including those coming into this country from Ireland, shall be sold for slaughter.Oils and Fats. The position with regard to stocks of linseed oil in the U.K. has grown appreciably more serious since the War Cabinet&apos;s decision of January 11th to allow 6,Q00 tons of linseed oil already in the possession of manufacturers of linoleum and leather cloth to be rationed among them. In view of the difficulty of buying linseed in the Argentine, coupled with the fact that there is not so much linseed oil in the country as the trade returns had seemed to show, it is necessary to restrict the consumption of linseed oil within the narrowest limits.The purchase of 10,000&apos; tons of tallow is now being negotiated in Australia. Half the amount of linseed required in this country is now being purchased, in India ; in the Argentine competition with the United States of America caused linseed prices to be high ; it is hoped to arrange for purchases of linseed to be made conjointly.Sugar for Jam. The Sugar Commission originally allocated 10,000 tons for the purposes of the domestic preserving scheme, and it was at that time provided that the allotment per head of household should not exceed 10 pounds of sugar. When the summaries of applications were received from Local Committees it was found that 1,700,000 households had applied, and that the average index number, that is, the number indicating the proportion of the total supplies that an applicant should obtain, was 3&apos; 4. Upon the basis of these figures, in order to allot 10 pounds per head, 26,000 tons would have been required. The stocks held by the Royal Commission, and those in prospect, would not permit of such a quantity being allocated for the purpose, but the Royal Commission substantially increased the amount set aside and the Director of Sugar Distribution was thus enabled to fix the unit value of index numbers at six pounds. This absorbed 15,480 tons, and in effect means that where the quantity of fruit possessed by applicants averages 10 pounds or more per member of their household, they will receive six pounds of sugar for each member of their household, and where the quantity of fruit averages less than 10 pounds per member of their household, there will be a corresponding reduction in the amount of sugar allotted to them.A 2
Tea. By the Tea (Retail Prices) Order, 19.1.8, and a Direction under the Tea (Distribution) Order, 19J8, made on the 4th May 1918, wholesale prices of tea were iixed throughout the United Kingdom and retail prices in Great Britain. The Food Control Committee for Ireland lias subsequently agreed to the application of the fixed retail price to Ireland and the Order will be immediately extended.National Rationing.Supplies of Meat. The supplies received from the U.S.A. continue to be sufficient for immediate requirements. Complaints of the quality of North American, meat are very numerous, but a recent cable states that the unsatisfactory light beef is nearly finished, and a high grade beef is now being purchased.The Commissioner for the North Western Division reports that the meat supplies are now satisfactory, and he draws attention to the loyalty shown by the great industrial area of his Division throughout a most trying period when there was a serious shortage of meat.Coupon Value.-It has been announced that, as from Sunday, 12th May 1918, and until further notice, the meat coupon will be available for the purchase of 6cZ. worth of butchers&apos; meat instead of M. worth as hitherto.Up to May 5th the public were able, by using their coupons on their meat cards, to obtain Is. 3d. worth of butchers&apos; meat weekly. On May 5th this quantity was reduced to lOd. worth by the reduction of the number of coupons that might be used for buying butchers&apos; meat from 3 to 2. The present concession, by enabling the public to buy Is. worth of butchers&apos; meat weekly compensates in part for the reduction of the number of coupons that may be used for that purpose.Supplementary Rations. The limited number of returns at present received from Food Control Committees indicate that over half a million supplementary ration cards have been issued.In view of the decisions of the Special Committee that the existing scheme should continue for the present, i.e., at least up to July 13, the Central Classification Com-mittee has completed its inquiry into the textile trades and is now issuing to Food Control Committees a list of women&apos;s occupations which it considers to be of a sufficiently arduous nature to entitle the women workers engaged therein to receive the supplementary ration. The question whether or not any supplementary ration should be allowed after July 13 is under consideration.Food Queues. The Commissioner of Police has decided to discontinue making returns of the number of persons in food queues in the Metropolitan area, in view of the fact that such queues have practically disappeared.Enforcement of Orders.The total number of prosecutions in the past week was 845, of which 748 were successful. There were 451 prosecutions in England, Scotland, and Wales, and 297 in Ireland. Compared with the previous week the numbers showed a decrease of 776. The prosecutions were instituted under 58 Orders three of which are new to the list Bacon, Ham, and Lard (Provisional Prices), Pigs (Maximum Prices), and Milk (Summer Prices). Ireland is responsible for all&apos; the prosecutions in connection with the Potatoes (Grocers&apos; Returns) Order numbering 43, and for 62 out of the total of 64 cases under the Tea (Prices) Order. The average fine for Ireland shows an increase of 5s. Qd., although the number of cases this week is considerably less than last.Among the returns for London this week were some 60 prosecutions under the Bread Order, and fairly large fines were imposed throughout this series of caseR.At Bow Street Police Court, on May 7th, a clerk employed by the Westminster City Council was sentenced to one month&apos;s imprisonment in the Second Division for having attempted to obtain 12 ration cards to which he was not entitled.
PART D.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.Though the level shown in last week&apos;s report has not again been reached, the aggregate weight of principal foods imported in the week ending May 4th was at the fairly satisfactory level of 253,800 tons (Table A). Compared with the corresponding week of 1917 there was an increase of 50,000 tons.Arrivals of cereals were much&quot; lower than in the previous week, but were still sufficient to meet current consumption. Wheat and flour together were 07,700 tons as against 132,000 tons in the week ending April 27th. Other cereals fell 43,600 tons to 55,000 tons mainly owing to the absence of any consignments of rice, but in part also to the drop in maize from 68,200 tons to 51,300 tons.Meat rose by 3,000 tons to 20,200 tons, compared with imports of 8,400 tons in the week ending May 5th, 1917, and with 16,100 tons, the weekly average of the pre-war year, 1913. Bacon and hams more than doubled on the week. Not since the outbreak of war have arrivals of bacon and hams, or of total meat, including bacon and hams, been so heavy in any one week.For several weeks past there have been no arrivals of margarine. The last two months&apos; imports of fats and sugar, with corresponding figures for 1917, were as follows : 	Sugar.

Fats, taking home supplies and imports together, greatly exceeded the rationed consumption.Consumption.Meat. Supplies of home-fed meat at the Central Markets, London, and at Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool increased 4 per cent, in the week ending April 27th over the previous week (Table B). A year ago there was a fall of nearly 20 per cent. Both this year and last the week saw a decline of about 16 per cent, in imported supplies. Taking the two kinds (home and imported) together there was a fall of 9 per cent, on the week before and of 20 per cent, on the corresponding week of last year. The weekly average for April was higher than that for March of this year by 15 per cent. Compared with 1917, the decline in April was less than that in the earlier months of the year, amounting to 25 per cent, whereas in January the decline had been 44 per cent., in February 37 per cent., and in March 38 per cent.At the Central Market total supplies for the week ended May 4th showed little change. Imported supplies formed 66 per cent, of the whole as against 71 per cent, in the previous week.The number of cattle stalled at the markets in the week ending May 4th was 40 per cent, less and the number of sheep 30 per cent, less than in the corresponding week of last year. The actual decrease in supplies of live stock is greater than this, since the abolition of sales outside markets makes the comparisons unduly favourable to this year.
The following table gives a comparison between the weeks ending April 27th and April 20th 1918 :-Number of Cattle Stalled.	Number of Markets.	April 20th, 1918.	April 27th, 191!;.

The consumption of bread and flour as shown by returns from bakers and retailers of flour for the four weeks to April 27th was in the aggre-gate the same as for the previous four weeks, and 1 per cent, less than in the corresponding four weeks of 1917 (Table E). Last year there was a fall of 31 per cent, from March to April.There was no great change in April in any part of the country, but there were falls in the Newcastle and Cardiff Divisions and rises in the Bristol and Home Counties (South) Divisions (Table K). Compared with April 1917 the most marked falls were in the Newcastle, London, and Glasgow Divisions. Stocks are slightly lower in most districts.	Four Weeks&apos; Consumption to April 27th, 1918.

Compared with a year ago, there was an increase of 120 tons or 6 per cent., and compared with the corresponding week of 1916, an increase of 57 tons or 3 per cent.Milk. A new table (Table D) is incladed this week giving an index of the quantity of milk carried on the principal railway lines in England and Wales monthly *since September 1917, and during the past four weeks. Since the period of maximum scarcity in December and January the supply has steadily improved. The improve-ment has been particularly marked during April. The index is now above the standard of September.

It now stands at 73s. 5d. a quarter compared with 70s. 2d. in the week ending December 1st, 1917. During the week April 27th to May 4th there was a slight fall in the price of barley to 56s. 5d. a quarter. A year ago it was 64s. 4d. a quarter. Canadian bacon which had remained steady at 177s. Qd. per cwt. since January has fallen to 176s. Qd.Following the additional tax on sugar of 11s. Sd. per cwt. the wholesale prices of cube and granulated sugar were raised by 11s. per cwt. to 64s. 9d. and 57s. 9d. respectively.Retail Prices.There were several important changes in retail prices during April (Table G.). The price of imported beef rose 6 per cent., and of imported mutton about 7 per cent. Milk fell more than 18 per cent. The percentage increase in the price of sugar was nearly as great.   Eggs fell 3 per cent. ; a year ago the price was rising.The result of the movements during the month was to lower slightly the general level of prices calculated on the basis of consumption in the autumn of 1917 :
