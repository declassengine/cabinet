(THIS D0QUM3MT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT).204SEC R E T. G.T.4578,    -ITAJi_C A B IN E T.TRANSPORT 03? AMERICAN TROOPS.Noto by the Secretary, covering Noto by Mr. Graeme Shomson.Noto by the Secretary.I circulate herewith for the information of the War Cabinet a Note by Mr. Graeme Thomson, Ministry of Shipping, relative to the transport of United States troops, &amp;c.In forwarding this Note to me, Mr. Graeme Thomson informs me that the United States Authorities are now fully alive to the importance of getting their troops ever at once, and he is satisfied that they cannot appreciably increase the number of American ships devoted to trooping except by withdrawing ships carrying supplies to Pershing&apos;s Army.This latter course they will not and cannot adopt in view of the policy of adding considerably to the strength of that Army,He adds that I can now safely give an assurance to the Prime Minister that approximately a quarter of a million American troops will be embarked in British and American tonnage combined in each of the months May, June and July, assuming, as 1-^*8,&apos;assured by General Hutchison, that the men are forthcoming, &apos;  $hose figures are drawn up on a conservs-tlve basis with a reasonable allowance to cover delays and casualties to shipping.(Signed)    M.P,A.HANK8i,Secretary.2 Whitehall Gardens, May 18th, 1918.Note1 by MrGraeme Thomson.I am glad to be able to report that the Shipping arrange-merits for troops in U*C.A* show great improvement, tho American Shipping devoted to trooping having been nearly doubled during the past month.     The actual fitting out of the American Ships for carriage of troops however is not carried out so oxpedi-tlously as it should&quot;be, the speed comparing unfavourably and in some cases most unfavourably with that of fitting British Ships in American- ports.This has been to some extent due to the practice of calling for competitive tenders for the vork instead of putting it in hand
at once on a cost plus percentage basis.   I was informed that th latter system was contrary to American Law, none the less in certain cases which they were persuaded to regard as of special urgency tho system of calling for tenders was departed from as it should be in all oases.-  A good deal of troop space is lost by the American practice of carrying crews enormously in excess of those carried in British steamers of a similar type.   This practice I was unable to get altered, my impression being that this course is pursued as a matter of policy with a view to training men for the American Uavy and in order to man the now ships building for their Mercantile liar ine.I should like to sound a note of warning as to the policy of allowing Goneral .PershingTs Array to he largely increased without first ascertaining that the numbers involved can be supplied and fed through the western  ranch ports.These ports already show signs of congestion which is illustrated by the fact that the American Shipping Authorities admit that the ships carrying stores for Serening&apos;s Army ere talcing an average of 72 days for the round voyage which should be completed in 60 days.The root cause of this is a shortage of wagons to carry the stores sway from the quays.The rate of importation of American wagons to France requires to be increased from the present scale of about 30 a day to a steady rate of 60 wagons a day,   (This figure I obtained to-day from General flash).&apos;.   The united states Authorities realise this but I am not satisfied that they are in face taking sufficiently drastic stops&quot;to remedy the situation promptly.On the other hand there is no difficulty in supplying and maintaining a largely increased army through the Northern French ports and the right policy from the point of view of both sea and land transportation is that the vast bulk of the -   men now being brought over should consist of infantry and machine gun units for filling up the gaps in the British and French Armies.Our own experience in the early stages of the war tells us that a vory serious &quot;blunder will be committed if we allow more ships to he allocated to transport and maintain an increased United States Army until ue have incontestible proof that.the transportation facilities in lestern France are equal to the strain,I am informed that the rate of discharge in the Western French ports shows improvement and the United States Authori-ties will raa e the most of this, hut the matter requires, and is receiving scrutiny from day to day for once a port becomes badly congested a practical deadlock results with a consequent waste of shipping which we are most certainly unable to face in present circumstances,(Signed)   GRAEME THOMSON, D.0f T. &amp; S.Ministry of Shipping.
