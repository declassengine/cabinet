Grind 1. Ball? ?m  0000(This Document is the Property of Hig Britannic MajestyU (government):&apos; ii,....... i......itu......IpgT ,I THB MISISIKY OP POOD, AH) TEE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE).Memorandum hy the President of the Board of Agriculture andFisheries.Ho clear distinction is drawn &quot;between the respective functions of the Ministry of Pood and the Board of Agriculture. Production is so   closely involved with prices and distribution that this indefiniteness continually creates difficulties which impede the work of the Board.Some of these difficulties are already known to tha Cabinet. They are illustrated by a recent action of the Ministry of. Pood.    On May 3rd, 1918, the Ministry of Pood announced the appointment of a &quot;Permanent Agricultural Advisory Committee&quot;, representing various agricultural organisations, to advise it generally on &quot;important agricultural matters&quot;.    As a result of the appointment of this Committee, and of the imperfect reference to them of a question for their opinion, the pood Controller, on May 7th, issued in his own name advice to farmers on the management of their live stock.The official advisers of the Ministry of Food on agricultural matters are the three Agricultural Departments of the United Kingdom.    They were neither consulted as to the appointment of the Advisory Committee, nor on the reference to it, nor on the advioe given by the Pood Controller to the agricultural industry.The difficulties are again illustrated by a recent proposal of the Ministry of Pood in respect of fish distribution which will to a great extent supersede the work dene by the Pishery Department of the Board (Sea Appendix A. attached).    This proposal raises the real question which has always been at issue between the Ministry of Pood and the Board.    It illustrates, also, one of the chief reasons why I ask that our respective functions should be defined and placed on a new basis.The Ministry of Pood regards the Board as representing producers, and discounts its advice as partial, if not hostile.    The Ministry is still dependent upon some one for advioe and information. It is therefore driven to rely on the trades.    The results might have been cxpeoted.    Producers have been harassed and exasperated; traders have had their position made relatively comfortable and secure.    Farmers do not so much complain that, as producers, their prioes have been limited.    Their complaint rather is that distributors have been relieved of risks and secured in the enjoyment of increased profits, while they themselves, taking all the risks of production, have been repeatedly made the subject of attack.    The measures of the Ministry of Food in dealing, for example, with meat, bacon, onions, and feeding stuffs illustrate both points.The Ministry has adopted these measures on the plea of the alleged necessity for control.    The remedy for every hitch or leakage, which occurs in working out an equitable distribution under flat rates of maximum prices, is found in still greater control, so that the Ministry of Pood is being steadily pushed towards the&quot; position of the sole dealer.    Already the Ministry is the chief wholesale buyer and seller of meat; after October it becomes the sole purchaser of the potato crpp;   the proposals outlined for dealing with fish must, in my opinion, eventually make the Ministry the onlybuyes?
&quot;buyer of fish on landing;   and I understand that proposals to take over all the milk distributing businesses of the country are far advanced.In proportion as the Ministry of Pood toccomes the only bujrer, control and direction of producers by the Departmerrt-Tm*t assuredly follow.    The Agricultural Departments of the United Kingdom, can only stand by and watch their functions exercised by a new set of officials who possess no knowledge of tho past history 6f agriculture, and are not concerned in its future development.    It is not only the immediate interests of producers that are prejudiced. The permanent interests of agriculture suffer, and the critical consideration of the measures of reconstruction that must follow after the war are neglected.It is from these aspects that I ask for a revision of the functions and powers of the Ministry of Pood in&quot; relation &quot;&quot;tooths ^-agricultural Departments of the United Kingdom, and the association of the Board with the Ministry at an earlier stage in dealing with the food supplies of the country.    Other cogent reasons seem to me tft point in the same direction.As a basis of discussion I suggest that the food supplies of the country should be dealt with by three Departments.1,    Supplies and purchase,2.    Home Production, i,e, the three agricultural Departments of the United Kingdom, combined for the purpose ot production and supply.3,    Conservation and Distribution, including internal transport, and the control of the Retail Trade4The frivot of the whole would be the Supplies and Purchase Department.     The duties of the Head of this Department would be, (1) to calculate the total quantities and various kinds of food required by the population;   (2) to inform the Head of the Homo Production Department from time to time of his requirements, and call upon him for estimates of the quantities which can be supplied in the United Kingdom;   (3) to purchase whatever supplementary food for man and beast can be acquired   abroad, and to arrange with the 8hippf.Lg Controller for the necessary transport;    (4) to keep the Head of the Conservation and Distribution Department continually informed of the quantities of food in sights and of trie ports or other localities at which the supplies will become available.The Heads of the three Departments should meet at frequent intervals so as to be in the closest touch with one another.    If once a fortnight, or once a month, a member of the Cabinet reviewed the work of the three Departments, I for one should welcome the additional security that each was working to its fullest capacity, and that all were working in harmony.    Points of extreme urgency &apos;*ould thus emerge on which Cabinet decisions might be immediately obtained, and the member of the Cabinet to whom the work was delegated would be the representative on that body of this particular section.If any one of the three Heads desires to recommend the fixing or the alteration of a price,, or the initiation of a policy, or the issue of a regulation, which directly or indirectly affects one or both of the other two Departments, he should bring the question before his colleagues as one of principle.     If they decide that a change is in principle, or practice desirable, the details should bareferred
soreferred to a Joint Committee formed of two of the prinoipal permanent advisers of each of the three Departments with instructions to take evidence and advice, and auggent the proposed price or investigate the detailn of the proponed policy or regulation,    On the report of this Committee, the three Heads would deoide or remit the report for further consideration of any points that might arise. The Head of each Department might also make use of this Joint Committee to investigate whether a change in principle was expedient in practice before bringing the question before his colleague.All Denouncements of decisions of tho Departments on policy, regulation v, or prices should bo issued in their joint names, so as to avoid controversies on tho share taken by each in the decisions arrived at.R, E, PROTHERO.14th May, 1918,
APiMPIX   A.Tfte ,^n4,q.t.r.Y aO&amp;gj ftQd the gjQ3ifiiljB.B-PJBftr,tagto,t. of the Board.The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries is responsible for fish production in England and Wales.    In order to carry out its functions and meet war conditions, it has been compelled to study questions of distribution, and to extend its organisation.     It has built up a staff, both at headquarters and in the fishing ports, which, though small, is trained, disinterested and of proved capacity.    It deals with the Railway Executive and with curing and canning firms in order to make full use of seasonal gluts;   it helps these latter establishments to obtain their necessary supplies;   it has advised the National Service Department and the trade as to the men who were indispensable, raring from fish friers to quayside labourers;   it has been in constant touch with the Admiralty as to the recruitment of fishermen for the Navy, the restriction of fishing areas and the movements of the fishing fleets.On the ground that the step is necessary to the establishment of an undisclosed system of distribution, the Ministry of Food has now announced their intention of replacing the Board*s staff, as far as all the port duties are concerned, by a new organisation of Advisory Committees and Executive Officers, though they &quot;would be happy to avail themselves of the services of any officers who are considered to be specially qualified to perform these new duties&quot;.This announcement of the Ministry of Pood follows prolonged discussions between the two Departments.    The Board starts) from the position that its port officers are already dealing with both fishermen and traders, and that its authority, for both the present and future interests of the industry, ought to be maintained^ It therefore proposed that, as far as landing and ^despatchare oonoerned, it should act as the agent of the Ministry of Pood to carry out the polioy and, as far as possible, the instructions laid down by them.    The Ministry of Pood rejected this offer and made the counter proposal that the Board1s chief fishery officer and suoh 1 of his staff as were engaged in direct work with the fishing industry should be transferred to their Departments    Neither proposition proved acceptable to the other party.    Meantime the Board had offered to submit for consideration a scheme of distribution that had been prepared in the Fishery Department. This suggestion has also been refused by the Ministry of Pood.Control of the distribution of fish must necessarily be both difficult and partial.    Neither the time, plaoe nor volume of I landings can be foreseen;   the perishable nature of the produce demands promptitude and elasticity in handling;   little time is allowed for the application of a rigid system to be worked by officials acting on instructions from headquarters.    Any system must be difficult to frame or to administer, and any scheme that iB adopted must be framed with disinterested knowledge, and above all in the interests of increased production.The Ministry of Pood possess no knowledge of fishery matters;   their officer in oharge of this work comes entirely new to the work;   he is obliged to rely to a great extent on the advioe of the trade;   and though the proposal of the Ministry of Pood discloses little of their scheme of distribution, the reasons which the Ministry of Pood state for their action clearly shew trade influences.The Board are net consulted as to the personnel of the proposed local advisory committees and executive officers.    It is,hewever
however, resorted that the Registrar of the County Court has been asked to betKJStte the Chief Executive Officer in the largest fishing port of the oountry.    The new organisation may do its work we 11* But it seems a doubtful policy to displace the Fishery Departments, who are disinterested, who know both the productive and trading sides of the fisheries, and who will be required, on the resumption of peace, to undertake the rapid reconstruction of the fishing industry and business.    Already the Ministry are olaiming to deal with production as well as distribution, and have begun to address letters to the Admiralty asking for this or that control of the fishing fleets.    The position of the Board1s officers, superseded in the ports by the executive officers of tho Ministry of Pood, must become equivocal and embarrassing;   their authority will be impaired; and their efforts to maintain continuity of the Board1s policy of development will be largely frustrated.    Officers of the Departments are at present in constant conference with the Ministry of Reconstruction and the Admiralty Reconstruction Committee on after-the-war problems, and their oapacity for usefulness must be seriously prejudiced by their temporary dismissal (for it amounts to nothing else) from participation in the most important functions of fisheries administratien.The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries make no claim to be the authority charged with the distribution of fish.    That is admittedly the business of the Ministry of Pood.    But the Board, with their knowledge and experience of Fishery affairs, do claim to be consulted in the framing of that policy, and afterwards to be utilised as far as possible in carrying it out without losing their identity.    There should be no difficulty in this, provided the Ministry of Food will recognise the Board as part of the machinery of Government, and not as a rival concern to be run out of business as quickly as possible.14th May, 1918.2. J, PROTHERO.
