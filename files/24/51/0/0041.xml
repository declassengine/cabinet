1   &apos;    , /2&quot;I I circulate a raevio rand urn and enclosureswhich I have received from the Attorney-General for Ireland.    I am very axdous not to trouble my colleagues with.more material about Ireland than is absolutely necessary, but I hope it will he possible for them to read these documents, as they give an admirable idea of the present difficult condition of things in Ireland,    I had not seen them when I expressed my own views at a recent Cabinet, but I think I may claim that they confirm everything that I then said.    Personally I am convinced that the proper course is to take time, not to be in a hurry about anything except the assertion of the law, and then I hope we shall find before very long that a different atmosphere has been created which will make it possible to deal with other questions.\I * H * L o13th fey,1918.
I IRELAND.On the 6th of hay I requostecl Brigadier-General Byrne -the Inspector General of the R.I.C. - to let me know whether the Constabulary could be fully relied on if called upon to arrest the Priests who&apos;in the .^nfci-Conscription Campaign are \ Royal preaching from tho Altar and at Chapel and other meetings to Ifcabu- their Congregations, arid telling them to assassinate thesoldiers and police if they come to conscript them, and are endeavouring to suborn the police to betray their allegiance. He told me that the agitation led by the Hierarchy and pushed actively by the Priests was telling on his men, and so serious on tho R.C. members of the Force was the effect of the Bishops and priests urging resistance as a &quot;moral&quot; and &quot;religious Duty&quot; that the   Constabulary could not be trusted to carry out suoh arrests and that if they were put to it the results might even be so disastrous as to break up the Force.Some time later in the day I had an interview with County Inspector Power of Kilkenny - the Inspector General being again present.   Mr. Power (who, like the Inspector General, is a Roman Catholic) told me that, having regard to the Bishops and Priests urging resistance to Conscription as a &quot;moral duty&quot;, the R.C. police could not be safely ordered to carry cut such arrests or to enforce Conscription, I knew he had great experience of the Land League agitation, and I said to him that priests were frequently arrested and imprisoned then.    He replied that the present conditions are quite different - the Bishops never before intervened as a body with a unanimous Declaration proclaiming re-si stance as a matter of- religion - and &quot;Faith and I        &quot;Morals&quot; - that an unprecedented situation had nowarisen
arisen creating a danger that never before had to be en-countered in the history of the Force.     He agreed with Brigadier General Byrne that to call on the police to arrest the Priests might have disastrous effects on the Force and possibly lead to its being broken up.   They both said that if such arrests had to be made they should be carried out by tho military.    This is a ?ery grave situation.    The discipline of the B&apos;orce has never hitherto wavered and the Government could always trust them implicitly,    H.M. Government has hadstsbefore it within the last few days several reports (selected from a large number) of Parish Priests and Curates preaching not only sedition but assassination, and in one instance even advocating poisoning.   The Government cannot permit any longer these murderous instigations to go unpunished.   To deal with them in Ireland under the ordinary law is impossible.   No jury dare to convict no matter how clear the evidence, and the life of the police or other witnesses who might testify at a public trial against them and who would be denounced by advocates would frequently be imperilled and in almost every case be rendered unbearable,   To bring these priests before the King&apos;s Bench and bind them to the Peace in default of sureties would be an altogether inadequate penalty, but it would at any rate publish to the world the enormity of their base and criminal instigations.    They would not give bail and they should then be arrested and imprisoned.    The question would then immediately arise of the expediency (in face of the statements made by the I.G. and County Inspector power) of straining the discipline of the police by ordering them to effect arrests under the warrant of the King&apos;s Bench,, Under the circumstances it seems better that they should be arrested by the military j    and tried by Court Martial under the D.R.R.  The proceedingsat
at the Court Martial should enable full publicity to be givento their infamous and criminal harangues for which they may bepunished.   Apart from tho inadequacy of the penalty which apetty sessions court could inflict, it would not be expedientto bring them to trial before Resident Magistrates even wheresuch tribunals might have jurisdiction.    The County Courthouses where the cases would be heard would be invaded bymobs of Sinn Feiners and riots would occur.It would be desirable to have full information from timeto time conveyed to the Vatican of the incitements to5      assassination by the priests0    And it would be of supreme icanadvantage for the moral of the R.I.C. if a pronouncement wouldbe obtained from Rome condemning the utterance by priests ofsuch instigations to crime.Ireland is in a most seditious and dangerous condition.The Sinn Fein organisation is a treasonable conspiracypreparing for another rebellion - it is looking for German Itora-m of assistance. Rebellions would occur at any favourable moment ler. -were it not for the large number of troops in the country. There is well-grounded apprehension of outrage and sabotage -threats of it are frequent and the number of claims for malicious injuries before the courts has been very great. Large subscriptions - amounting now to about  60,000 - are being given or exacted at the Chapels for the &quot;National Defence Fund&quot; to resist Conscription.   The &quot;Freeman&quot; of May 6th reports that  470 was collected on the previous Sunday at Marlboro&apos; Street Cathedral -  500 at Westland Row -  680 at Phibsboro and  1,250 at Dunmore, Galway, and a very large number of other substantial contributions.   Isolated Protestants in the South are being intimidated to subscribe and to sign anti-conscription pledges.    I annex a leaflet&quot;A
&quot;A Call to Irishwomen&quot; which was distributed by the thousand in Dublin at the Chapel doors last Sunday, and also a so-called Protestant Protest against Conscription&quot; which speaks for itself,     The Secretary is Miss Nellie 0&apos;Brien, a grand-daughter of Sm.th 0&apos;Brien, the great rebelof 1848o    It is essential that steps should be taken to enforce order, and a -onsistent and drastic policy inaugurated.Procedure (Ireland) Act, 1885, should be brought into operation1,1885.by Proclamation -   It was found most effective in restoringorder at the time of the Land League,   The people know what itmeans, and if the country were proclaimed under it the peasant-&apos; ry would at once believe that the Government was in earnest andmeant to Govern, and the effect would, I believe, be a welcomerelief to all well-disposed persons.locla- The Sinn Fein organisation should be proclaimed under the ItionIs.    Act by special Proclamation as a &quot;Dangerous Association&quot; - asfin as[dan-   it unquestionably is within the legal definition of such an IrousIsocia- &quot;association&quot; in the Act.    The effect of such proclamation Ion,would then be that any Sinn Fein meeting would be an unlawful assembly and the Association itself would be an unlawful association;   and any person calling together or taking part in a meeting of the Executive or any Branch of it or any Sinn Fein Club, or printing and publishing notices calling meetings or soliciting contributions or subscribing to the Association would be guilty of an offence and could be prosecuted and con-victed before two Resident Magistrates.    This would stop the subscriptions and be welcomed by the farmers and others as an excuse for not parting with their money.  Powers are given to try cases by special jury and to hold investigations which would greatly facilitate the Executive. A great defect in theprocedureI am strongly of opinion that the Criminal Law and
procedure under the D.0.R.Act is that the smaller class of cases has to go before a Court of Ordinary Petty Suasions, and no conviction in such cases can be expected in Ireland, ,. as the Magisterial Bench has, in recent years, been com-pletely debased.    It is practically only in Dublin, where a Stipendiary Divisional Magistrate constitutes the Court, that summary proceedings under the D.R.R. are effective. The D.O.R.A., should be amended and the Resident Magistrates given jurisdiction in all such cases.In addition to bringing the Crimes Act into force and proclaiming Sinn Fein as a Dangerous Association, it is absolutely essential, in my opinion, that the leaders of the Sinn Fein organisation should be at once deported and interned.    There is abundant evidence of hostile associa-tion with the German enemy forthcoming, and there should be no more delay in banishing these enemies of the State from Ireland.    They are day by day organising effectively and concocting rebellion.    The seditious Press should also be rigorously suppressed and their printing works seized and type confiscated, and the seditious literature with which the newsvendors1 shops are crammed cleared out of them and pulped.The agitation and organisation against Conscription have been rapidly consolidated, and the enforcement of military service must be effected gradually with great discretion.     I suggest that the first application should be against the refugees from military service who flocked in thousands to Ireland from Great Britain since the commencement of the war, and who are a most un-desirable and unpopular element amongst the Irish popula-tion, engaged in betting and whippet-racing, who the police could at once identify and round up.    This would be quite a popular application of conscription in Ireland to . iieginwith
with.    An announcement tot any person identified in the future as taking part in illegal drilling would be deemed fit for military service and conscripted would also have a very useful effect.It is, in my opinion^ impossible to hope that any Home Rule measure would at present be accepted by Nationalist Ireland. The Sinn Fein body has completely captured the Nationalist party and any proposals for Federal Home Rule or sunn scheme as the Convention suggested will be now repudiated by the National-ists with contumely.    The Southern Unionists, owing to the antir-conscription revolt of the Nationalists and the attitude of the Hierarchy and Priests, are now unanimously of opinion that no scheme of Home Rule such as their delegates (supported at the Convention could be safely introduced.    I have spoken within the last few days to the most prominent of the Southern Union-ist delegates to the Convention:   the ^Archbishop of Dublin; Mr. George Stewart, Mr. A. Jameson and Mr. Powell (now Solicitor General) and that is their conviction.    The Ulster Unionists are more determined than ever against Home Rule.   In fact, no &quot;Settlement&quot; of the Irish problem on legislative lines is at the moment possible, and the Covemment will only court repulse if a Bill is introduced.    It would be impossible to enact a &quot;settlement&quot; that all sides reject.    I suhait that the extra-ordinary outburst of seditious and disloyal antagonism against the obligation to military service in common with Great Britain and the proved and active association of Sinn Fein with the German enemy since the announcement of the Government&apos;s inten-tion to introduce Home Rule and Conscription, not as interdepen-dent but as contemporaneous measures, fully justifies the post-ponement of a Home Rule measure.    The temper of Ireland istoo
too bad to Hope for any reconciliation at present, and it wouldbe a much safer and practical course to postpone the generalenforcement of conscription for the present - postponing alsothe introduction of any Home Rule Bill during the presentParliament, and to take in hand the restoration of order andpublic confidence.    I have not spoken to a single man inIreland who has now the least hope of any &quot;settlement&quot; being atpresent possible oy means of any Home Rule or Federal scheme.The universal opinion is that at the moment it would makethings far more unsettled and be accompanied by greater antagon-ism and sectarian animosities than unhappily now predominate.A new and vigorous campaign for voluntary recruitingfed should be inaugurated - and-the Bill (which is ready drafted)Ittle-int for    for settling the men who have served in the war on the unoccu-jldiers.pied lands in the hands of the Estates Commissioners and Con-gested Districts Board passed through Parliament without delay.I enclose a copy of a letter, dated 7th May 1918, written to m by my predecessor in the office of Attorney General -Mr. Justice James 0&apos;Connor - a convinced Home Ruler.    It puts his view that both measures should be postponed, and he states this is concurred in by two R.C. Bishops he had been speaking to.    He also sent me a letter to him from Cardinal Logue which makes it clear that a Home Rule Bill on the now proposed lines would be banned by the Church, c(Sgd.) ARTHUR I. SAMUELS. 10.5.1918.
Merrion.7-5-18.My dear Samuels,There is only one way of putting an end to the present intolerable &quot;situation in Ireland, and that i3 by dropping - or not persevering in - the Home Rule .Bill md likewise dropping conscription.Thisiet certain - that Mat.iona.Ust Ireland won&apos;t take the., bill now in draft.In proof of this I enclose a letter from Cardinal Logue, in, referenoe to the Prime Minister^ letter.    Now the Cardinal-is&quot;a moderate;   so you may imagine what the taorre^extreme .Naiionalists^will say.Nor will the bill please anybody, as far as I can see, save two or three dozen people who by reason of being associated witfch -the Convention, are predisposed in its-favour.    It will, of course, be bitterly opposed by Horth..liaa:t- -Uls te r.The dropping of both measures will be a blessed relief and will be accepted by all Irish parties as a way out.    I spoke to-day to two Catholic Bishops - one an Imperialist;   the other slightly Sinn Fein - and they quites agreed with me.I trust you will press this view on the Prime Minister, - to whom you can send this letter and its en-closure if you wish.I may add that if this course be adopted, the fact of Conscription being held over may help you to keep the peace in the country;   though I should like to point out that a ministerial announcement as to conscription not-being applied should be made as soon as possible, for theunrest
unrest is preventing proper attention being given to agricultural and other work in the country.Sincerely,(Sgd.) JAilKS 0&apos;COiinOB.A.W. SAMUELS, ESQ., K.C. ,M.P., A TTORKEIY&quot;-GENERAL.Please let me have back the enclosure.
1st March, 1918My dear Mr. 0&apos;Connor, - ^I have carefully read over the proposals of Mr. Lloyd George;   and I am sorry to say, in my opinion they will settle nothing.    I believe thatr if published at present, they would be promptly rejected with contempt, and would strengthen the hands and complete the influence of the promoters of disorder.I have not read the clauses of the Home Rule Act on the Statute Book, and only know its pro-visions from newspaper comments, but, from what I know of it, I believe it is as good, if not a better settlement than that proposed by Mr. Lloyd George. It. keeps Ireland-whole and unpartitioned;   whereas, in the proposals, there is an undeniable, though disguised partition of Ireland. .1st. It is proposed that the Parliament should meet for alternate sessions in Dublin and Belfast.2nd.    fiie principal offices of an Irish Depart-ment of manufacturing industry and commerce should be located in Belfast.3rd.    The most extraordinary proposal, unknown I believe to any legislative assembly in the World, that a committee of the assembly, (not any external authority of King or President) should have the power of vetoing the enactments of the assembly. If this be not partition, real and effective, though disguised, I don&apos;t know what it is.    The example of South Africa.is futile.    In South. Africa, there were three separate independent states, the Cape,The
The Boer Republic, and the Orange Free State. Ireland has been and is an ancient Kingdom, one and undivided, acknowledged as such by the British con-stitution, with an ancient Capital, which was a Capital before Belfast was even a decent village.The partition of this old nation and the degradation of this ancient Capital to please Belfast is a thing which will not go down with Irishmen. This may be regarded as mere sentiment;   but national sentiment is a thing to be reckoned with, and one for which men have been prepared to make great sacrifices, even the sacrifice of life itself.With regard to customs and excise, I note the proposal is made to the Irish Parliament control of &quot;all taxation other than customs and excise;&quot;  what that other taxation is I don&apos;t know.    I suspect it is a negligible quantity, except perhaps the power of overloading the people with special taxes to make up for the void which shall be created by sweeping away the income which will accrue from the chief sources of taxati on.The complicated and vague scheme of settling the customs and excise and financial relations after the war is I regard as so much moonshine.    We know what a celebrated Commission on financial relations has already come to.    I am pretty sure that, if we wait for a settlement of these matters till after the war, Ireland will have a poor show.    Why not decide now, by positive and definite legislation the handing over to the Irish Government customs, excise, the post-office and police;   putting the application ofthe
the enactment in abeyance till after the war, if necessary.    The same may be said of the principles by which the financial relations should be determined. This would give security;   whereas the vague proposals and promises would give none.It may be uncharitable, but I find it hard to resist the conviction that this wnole business, Convention, and all, is a piece of clever play - it would be disrespectful   to call jockeying - to keep the Irish question floating till the war is over, and then leave Sinn Fein, Carsonism and Socialism to fight each other over the fate of unfortunate Ireland. This is the view which the public will certainly take of futile proposals of settlement.Hence I believe it is the duty of the Nationalist members of the Convention to insist on the earliest possible report, or reports, as the case may be, and leave to the Government the responsibility of acting or refusing to act on the report of the maj ority.I am,Bear !:r. 0&apos;Connor,Yours faithfully, (Sd)    I   liichael Card. Logue.
