W     At.50Colonel 1. Dally Jones.WAR CABIIIST,0103/2A&amp;00,^^^y^roposed In sue of Horseflesh to Knemy priaonera of tfar. ^(G T^&quot;^^ Memorandum by the Secretary of State, xA review of the soale of rations issued to Enemy Prisoners of War in this country with the intention of bringing it into closer correspondence with the scale of the civilian population, has raiaed the question of substituting horseflesh for beef and mutton on whioh, f as it involves a matter of principle, I should like the decision of the War cabinet.The objections to the proposal may bo briefly stated as       Ifollows(a) The scale aimed at for prisoners of war is that in foroe for I the civilian population, and horseflesh is not an integral pfcrfc^oXf their diet in this country,(b) Less favourable treatment than that accorded to the civilian   1 -   population might react on the treatment of our prisoners in 1Germany.The arguments for the adoption of the change are:-(a) The issue of horseflesh would save other forms of meat, and the saving io appreciable as the number of German prisoners of war is now between fifty and fifty five thousand,     (it is not proposed tc restrict the Vneat ration entirely to horseflesh as supplies might not always be obtainable).(b) Horseflesh Is a common article of diet in Germany and   its issue would not impose any hardship,(c) The evidence of our returned and escaped prisoners and the information in the Report on the treatment by the enemy of Britif?h Prisoners of War behind the firing lines in France and Belgium (Cd, 8083. page 6) show that their staple diet is soup, in many oases lr,:cgeiy devoid of nutrition., and that meat, when givenj, is horseflesh,(d) There can be no doubt that Germany does not attempt to feed her prisoners on the same scale as her civilian population, and short of actual starvation could not treat^them much worse,MILKER.11th May, 1913.
