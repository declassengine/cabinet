The Imperial War Conference which mot attho Colonial Office on 30th Larch, 1917, passed thofollowing resolution :-&quot;That the Admiralty bo requested &quot;to work out immediately after the conclusion &quot;of the war what they consider the most &quot;effective scheme of naval defence of tho &quot;ICmpiro for the consideration of the several &quot;Governments summoned to the Conference, &quot;with such recommendations as tho Admiralty &quot;consider necessary in that respect for the &quot;mmpir^s security,&quot;It was further suggested at the Conference that it would to of oreat assistance if the Dominion Governments could receive in advance a general outline of what the Admiralty consider best, so that the matter might be studied locally and no time be lost, in coming to an agreement on principles.2,-    In considering this largo question, the Admiralty have recognised that any suggestion put forward at the present time for the closer co-ordination of the Naval Force of the British -empire mag be affected by constitutional&apos;changes decided upon subsequently. It is thought,&quot;however, that any such changes will bo in the direction of associating the self-governing nations with questions of Imperial Policy, and this has been borne in mind in approaching the subject.3.   It is assumed
3,-    It is as Glided that the great stru&amp;rlo in which&apos; we arc now enured has proved to all concerned that it is upon the. maintenance of it* soa-power that the communities which form the British Empire must rely for their indo- . pendent existence, and that, as in tho past, the various Dominions are willinj bo share in the provision of tho necessary force   Hitherto the choice &quot;before the Dominions has lain between forming separate Floot units or contributing men and money to the British Flcot.   Money contributions have always boon&quot;unpopular0   Floot units are not within the reach of some of tho Dominions and can never be so economical or effective as would bo ono single Fleet under ono control in peaoo and war.4For the preparation of adequate and effective war plans, knowledge of what naval forces can be counted on with certainty, a peace distribution to meet probable war requirements, and the power to dispose-the Fleet as requisite instantly on the development, of a critical situation are essentials4.-    lit its scattered nature the British Umpire differs from all others.   Its only lines of communication are by the sea, and tho continuan.ee durin;: the war of its sea-borne traffic is necessary to its existence.   Tho problem ah/ays before the Eavy is to keep tho waterways free.Tho present war has dispelled much of the doubt surrounding the problem, but has also disclosed now difficulties.   The primary duty of the liavy is now,
as formerly, to sink the onemy or to drive him from the sea- and so far as surface craft are concerned it may claim to have been successful, but the new element which has arisen - ,the submarine - requires special measures, including a largo increase of small craft in proximity to enemy bases and protection from the submarine cruiser at sea.,50   The strength and distribution of naval force in peace and its disposition on the threat of war are primary factors in maintaining that command of the sea without which no community within the Empire can hope to retain the freedom it now enjoys: and it will be one of the first duties of the Admiralty on the conclusion of peace to report on the needs of the Empire in these respects, and of. the self-governing nations together to decide upon the best method of meeting them,6.   In view of the above considerations, the Admiralty, convinced as they are that a single Navy is necessary for the security of the whole Empire,have drawn up the following proposals for a naval organisation, and in so.doing have borne in mind that :u(i)      With a single Navy the right of the nations within the Empire to partnership with the United Kingdom in the provision, adminstration and disposition of the Fleet must receive full recognition,(ii)      Uniformity and avoidance of overlapping in adminstration and supply are essential if economy in personnel and material is to be attained.7.     The outline.
7. The outline cf the proposed scheme is as follows(i) The whole naval force   of the Empireto form one Navy,, all effective units being under tho control of an Imperial Naval Authority both in peaoo and war, Ships to be available to serve in any waters., and officers and men in any ship.(ii) Local Navy Boards, each under a Ministerfor the Navy, to &quot;be established by the partner nations, working in co-operation with the Imperial Naval Authority but directly responsible to their arm Parliaments 0(iii) The Imperial Naval Authority and itsStaff would.deal with all questions of Naval strategy, and subjects connected with the provision, equipment, efficiency, organisation and utilisation of the Navy as a fighting force; promotions and appointments; principles of training; the formulation of requirements on which the Annual Estimates would be prepared; types of ships and materiel,&amp;e0(iv) The Navy Boards would control all localnaval establishments, such as dockyards, training colleges, and schools; undertake construction, repairs, and carrying out of works, and deal with the entry and training of personnel, the provision of materiel and supplies, and other subjects connected with the maintenance cf the Fleet in a state of efficiency.(v) The Naval Ccnimander-in-ehief on eachstation would be in command of all Naval Forces afloat, including local defence vessels when in commission.The Imperial Naval Authority would keep the Ministers for the Tfevy informed of orders given to the Ocranander-in-ohief,(vi) Each nation would decide, with dueregard to its resources the extent to which it would share in the total cost of the Navy, and,as far as possible,control the expenditure of the monej it provides.After considering estimates, prepared/annually
annually on a statement of the requirements of the Empire drawn up by its Staff, the Imperial Naval Authority would make proposals as to the share of work each nation would take, subject to the approval of tho respective Parliaments.(yii) Local resources would be developed andutilised for shipbuilding, repairs, provision of war materiel, etc,, special attention being attached to interchangeability of all resources, personnel, material (especially munitions), designs, etc.      Members of the Navy Boards would be required to keep in touch with tho corresponding members of the Maintenance Commit tee of the U,K. Admiralty, with a view to ensuring uniformity in such matters,(viii)       Officers and men would be entered for theNavy locally, with equal prospects of advancement.Naval colleges for junior officers, depots for newly^-entered men, schools for gunnery, torpedo, etc,, would be established by each Navy Board in the same way as at the home naval ports in England,, The curriculum andexaminations would be in accordance with the requirements of the Naval Staff and as nearly as possible uniform, so that officers or men might qualify or requalify for special ranks or ratings in whatever part of the world they might bo serving.(ix)       Discipline, uniform, qualifications for promotion and advancement, etc,, to be the same for all,      Tho selection of officers for promotion and appointment to commands might be dealt with by a Committee of the Imperial Naval Authority.(x)       The question of pay would require special consideration and would depend largely on conditions prevailing after the war; the rates to be as uniform as practicable./ It is not
,8.   It is not possible in this paper to make any final 10Lproposals as to the composition, title and constitutional status^ of the proposed Imperial Naval Authority.    The manner in which a chain of responsibility is to be established between it and the Nationsof the Empire must, it is thought, be determined by the form in which it may be ultimately decided to give expression to the desire for the closer union of the Empire,     The Admiralty, however, make the following tentative suggestions for covering what may perhaps be looked upon as a transitional period.0.   The Ministers of the Navy of the self-governing Nations i should attend whenever possible as members of the Imperial Naval I Authority, and at least once a year, for the considerati.cn of the Annual Estimates and deliberation on large matters of policy.In their absence, they could be represented generally by the First Lord of the Admiralty, with whom they could be placed in direct communication, and through this channel they would be consulted and would have at all times an opportunity of expressing the views of their Governments, on the distribution of the Naval Forces and other important questions affecting the squadrons in their waters,10  These are, however, only temporary suggestionsa    On the political and constitutional side, they would, it is hoped, be superseded by more continuous representation as part of the solution of the larger problems referred to6     On the naval and professionalside, the Staff of the single Navy would formthebasis of an organisa-fullytion which would gradually become mx&amp;J representative as officers drawn from the Overseas Nations acquired sufficient naval experience to fill the higher adminstrative posts on or under the Imperial NavalAuthority.110 If the proposed scheme is accepted by the other Nations, it should be possible to devise arrangements to enable India to share in it.    It is recognised that the status of the Royal Indian Marinewould require adjustment (signed)   R. E. WEUffSS.1.5.18. .
