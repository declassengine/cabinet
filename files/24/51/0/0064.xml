$       MEMORANDUM FOR WAR CABINET.VIt has become apparent to me that the time hasarrived when it is necessary to formulate a policy by which His Majesty&apos;s Government shall be guided in all matters relat-ing to tho advancement and direction of petroleum industries. Up to the present time each department concerned has formulated its own policy, and there has consequently beon an absence of co-ordination which has frequently proved to be embarrassing, while difficulty has been experienced in reconciling divergent interests. It is therefore my intention to entrust to a small Committee the important work of elaborating a general policy which shall be applicable in all cases and shall form a basis which will enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to deal uniformly with all questions relating to the industry whether departmental or commercial which may arise for decision and settlement in the future.&quot;To enquire into and advise as to the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government should follow to secure supplies of oil for naval, military and industrial purposes&quot;.I have asked the following gentlemen to acceptand am taking steps to secure representation on the Committee of the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, the Treasury, and the Board of Fuel Research.Petroleum Executive, 12, Berkeley Street, f., and for all official purposes it will be considered to be attached to that Department,The terms of reference which I am addressing to the Committee are as follows:-nomination to the Committee:-Viscount Harcourt (Chairman) Colonel Sir Robert Horns.
