THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MA^BTYjS GOVERNED,)SECRET.&quot;- WAR CABINET.. INTERVENTION IN RUSSIA.(Note by General Smuts with reference to &quot;War Cabinet 409a)The War Cabinet this morning appointed Lord Kilner and myself together with the First Sea Lord, and the C.I.G.6. as a Committee to consider the question of the steps which could immediately be taken to organise military resistance to the enemy, in Russia while the correspondence with. America, and Japan in reference to intervention was proceeding.     We met this afternoon and arrived at the following conclusions(l)     A great deal of confusion and. cross correspondence was at present arising from the absence of any definition and apportionment, of military responsibility in Russia among the Allies.     It seemed to us, therefore, advisable to divide the responsibility for certain localities among the Allies as hereunder stated.     It seemed also, anomalous that, while great efforts were being made to secure the intervention of Japan in Russia, the Czecho-Slovak troops should be 1 removed from that country to the Western front.     The Shipping Controller reported that any transport of Czecho-Slovak troops would simply divert tonnage from the transport of equivalent numbers of American troops, and it appeared inadvisable to ask for Japanese tonnage for the purpose at the very time when we were pressing Japan to undertake intervention in Russia which would absorb all her tonnage.     We therefore came to the conclusion that the Czecho-Slovak troops no&quot;r at Vladivostock or on their way to it should be taken charge of there and be organised into efficient units by the French Government to whom, the above difficulties in the way of their transport to France should be pointed out, and who should, be asked that, pending their eventual transport to France, they might be used to stiffen the Japanese as part of an Allied force of interven-tion in Russia,     Similarly the rest -of the Czecho-Slovak force in Russia should be collected at Murmansk and Archangel preferably the latter, and should,   be taken charge of there and organised by the British Government^ and pending their transport across the sea should be used to hold those places and to take part in any Allied intervene tion in Russia,     The Secretary of State for War undertook to send a telegram in the above sense to K. Clemenceau who had addressed a question to him about the transport of the Czecho-Slovaks from Vladivostock in execution of the Supreme War Council resolution on the subje t.     It was felt that the collection.and organisation of large bodies of troops at the above ports would in itself be a warning to Germany against the removal of further divisions to the Western Front.2,       It was decided that General Poole should proceed as soon as possible to Russia as our military representative in order to take charge of military affairs so far as the British Government was concerned, and to advise the War Office as to all steps to be taken -in regard to our intervention in Russia.     Meantime his London office would collect the necessary officers and. N.C.CS.. more or lees on the lines of the Dunsterville mission        to assist him in the task of organising the Czecho-Slovaks and other forces of intervention from Archangel and Murmansk.     The First Sea Lord undertook to send some 200 marines for the defence of Archangel, and the War Office to send such munitions and supplies as General Poole might deem necessary for the purpose of his mission.     General Poole was to consider, while holding and safeguarding the positions at Murmansk and Archangel, how far he could work up from Archangel towards Vologeda with the forces at his disposal.
11th May, 1918.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.3. It was not considered advisable at the present juncture to move either American or other Allied troops from the West to Russia, though the matter should bo   reconsidered at a later stage of the present enemy offensive on the Western front.4.   After the discussion this morning at the War Cabinet at which the Prime Minister pointed out how difficult and indeed impossible it was for M. Trotsky to invite Allied intervention &quot;in Russia, however much he might desire it, before an Allied force was on the spot to protect him against tho enemy,1 -it was felt by the Committee that an undue weight had been placed,in our recent correspondence, on the desirability of an invitation for intervention from the Bolshevik Government.   It was there-fore decided to recommend to the Foreign Office that the difficulties against such an invitation should be pointed out to the American and Japanese Governments, and that they should be pressed to be satisfied with the very strong expressions which had already fallen from M. Trotsky and the Bolshevik foreign Minister without waiting for a formal invitation which the Bolshevik Government could not be expected to make in their present helpless situation.(Signed)    J.O. SMUTS.
