His Britannia &apos;&quot;&apos; &apos;^Government,)(This Document is the,Property of olitioal Intelligence Department,FOREIGN OFFICE.Confidential.Norway /002.M3M0RAJDIM/ON LABOUR TROUBLESIN NORWAY.The Norwegian Bolshetrists alias Syndicalists do not appear to be prepared, like the Russians, to go to all lengths to secure their aims.     In the month of April, sporadio disturbances took place in various parts of Norway, in most cases due to the sympathy of the working-classes with some recalcitrant oonscript or conscripts, yet in every case where the local police had failed to maintain and re-store ord6r, the mere display of military force suffioed to oalm the spirit of the mob. .A Bhort acoount of the more important disturbances at Sulitjelma and Trondhjem - the two were inter-oonnected - will^give some, idea of their causes and dimensions.    In the second week of April at Sulit-Jelma, a mining town in the,province of JTordland, polioe were sent from the nearest town, BpdB, to arrest two conscripts who had been sentenced to imprisonment for insubordination.;   As soon as the poliDe appeared in Suliijeima, the miners obstructed, them in the execution of their duty and the culprits managed io escape.    The railway officials were then compelled by the mob to take the polioemen back to $odd. Soldiers were despatched to enforce order and of these some 800 mobi-lised at Trondhjem sent a deputation to the General asking for an ex-plan at ion of their mobilisation.    This they naturally failed to get. On the next day, April 12th, the workers downed tools and ^reat orowds collected.    Speeches were held protesting against the sending of spl-diers to Sulitjelma, a resolution was passed requiring the Government to rescind the mobilisation order and the S.S.,?Sigurd Jarl&quot;, destined to take the troops to Sulit^elma, was boarded by the mob, which did muoh damage and destroyed the parcel post.     6,000 people were oon-,cerned in thsse ricts and the police were severely handled.    On the-1-/l4th
41114th April, however, a display of military force brought about altered conditions and strong police reinforcements, whioh had meanwhile ar- , rived, were not required.    By the 16th April the Government had also suooeeded in getting control of the situation in Sulitjelma without bloodshed and on that date an official telegram announced that every-thing was quiet in the mines there.All these events seemed to be leading up to serious disturbances on the 1st of May and there is no doubt that this date was anticipated j with very considerable nervousness in Norway.    Yet it passed off with-out important trouble of any kind.    In Christian!a, the number of people participating in the Socialist demonstration was somewhat greater than last year.    About 15,000 wero addressed by Buen and Man, members of the Storting, and the oditors Moe-Jo^hansenand Mar-tin Tranmael;   the last was the only representative among the speakers of tho Syndioalist Section now controlling the Party machine.    He made a quite unsensational speech to the effect that the worsen would prefer to obtain tile satisfaction of &quot;their demands peacefully and con-stitutionally, although they were prepared to use other means if ne-cessary,    It Is, by the way* not clear how Trenmael was at.liberty X to address the orowd on this occasion for on the 16th of April, he had been tried for Incitement and disorder in a speech made a few weeks ago, and condemned to 60 days1 imprisonment and a finje of 50 Kroner: probably ho is still at liberty pending the result of his appeal against the sentence.    Buen, of the old Socialists, stated that he had reason to believe that a law introducing a temporary 8-hour a day would be discussed within the next few days in the Storting.    Lisa, his colleague, declared that Socialism would win even without the use of guns and violent speeches.    The only definite sign of the &quot;Reds&quot; was a solitary banner inscribed &quot;Wake up, workmen!    The Revolution is earning.    Be prepared.&quot;It would appear that during the last three weeks the opposition to Bolshevism in werking-olass circles is increasing and that a split-2- /in
in, the&apos; Socialist Party will take place.    It will.be recollected (vide \mm- on.Norwegian Bolshevism, of the 18th of April) that at the General Conference of the Norwegian Socialist Party, the two opposing factions parted in peace and amity and that a member of the old executive called for concerted action in the cause of Socialism.    Now it is clear that tits Syn&amp;ioalistB have just cause to fear that the oia Socialists will nominate theia? own oandidates for the Storting elections in the autumn, for the latter have issued a manifesto appealing for meetings to be held in support of the old policy as against the new, with its resolu-tions In favour of military strikes and dictatorship.    &quot;Social-Demo-kraten1&apos;, the official organ of the Party, now, of oourse, controlled by the Syndicalists, waans the old leaders against embarking on such a policy.    It is, however, hardly likely that the latter will allow themselves to be deterred frsm going their own way, especially as S3 out of the 24 Socialist members of the. present Sijolrbiug are of their persuasion.The signs that the new movement is on the whole at least not gaining in popularity are definite.    We have firstly the faot that on the 5th of May the attempt of the Syiiaioalists to force an 8-hours working day on the Government by means of a strike was unsuccessful. Particulars are not yet to hand but events of the past fortnight er so had already shown that the skilled workmen were not inclined to support this proposal and that it had, in consequence, small chance cf success.    The trades Unions in Christiania, for instance, oon-trolled as they are for the most parfc by the old Socialists, refused to take aotion in support of the 8-houxe working day scheme and in most other towns the Unions adopted the same attitude.    The workmen of Trdnd^om and one or two other places were the exception to the and in these towns strikes were successfully started on the 5tla f of , sy but as these are isolated oases only, they are hardly likely to affect the attitude of the Government.    The general secretariat of $ e workers have also pronounced against .extra,parliamentary methods-3- /for
&apos;ll^S()x^--^o**Jjag-v-aa 8-hours working day though they have petltlonod the I  QoVwinment to introduce it temporarily in view of the shortage, of 1 rations, and the impossibility for a worlcaan under present oondltiona to &quot;work for a longer period..fceoondly, as so often happens, aeoession to power has exercised j a distinctly moderating influenoe on tho wild men.    Most of the newleaders have moderated their violent language and no longer counsel jj mass-action, revolution, nor a dictatorship of the proletariat., I  &quot;SQoial-DBiaokrateia&apos;Ti the official organ already alluded to, now under the editorship of the Syndicalist Schoflo, is quite moderato in tono. It even denies that revolutionary action was ever advocated in any I Norwegian Socialist paper, and this despite the fact that the Socialist organ &quot;Arfceidet&quot;, when edited by Sehe;flo, had contained most inflammatory articles.    It is noteworthy, too, that this paper i protests against the term &quot;Syndioalist&quot; being applied to the new party.    Syndicalism, it explains, foreswears parliamentary action -Socialism strives for parliamentary power.    She new leadership, it definitely states&apos;, does not adhere to the Syndicalist view of Society..... &apos; &apos;Other Syndicalist papereV too, sound the same note.  .The fact is that in a truly democratic state such as is the Norwegian, the soil is not good for the Bolshevist growth.    There is no reactionary party in Norway to &quot;be overthrown, grievances can be relived by constitutional methods, and as the Government shows the intention to grant all reasonable demands, the ground is cut from I under the feet of tie extremist agitators.
