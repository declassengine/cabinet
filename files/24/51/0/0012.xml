C This Document is the Property of Htt Brftannic Majesty&apos;s Government) MONTHLY R1.P0R?mmGJaS^^I &quot;&apos;aoHK of the iom oi mm:.;-&apos; 1916.I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet the following brief -account of tlie iv or It of the Board of Trade during the*month of April, 1910, which deals&quot;only &quot;with questions&apos; likely to interest wf colleagues and does not profess to be an account of the ordinary departmental work of the Board, or&apos;to &quot;include all the important ques-tions considered by the Department.GQlMM m IOTJ8TBYEGYPrijlN CGTTOMCOTTONink&apos;The ration of 450,000 bales of Egyptian cotton&apos; &apos;.t&quot;     ... .\ . -   .. :allocated to the United Kingdom for the current season under the rationing scheme at present in force having1 been practically, exhausted, the Department authorised the Egyptian Cotton Exports Eegulati-on Committee to&apos; increase the ration up to&quot;475,000 bales.    The present crop is proving larger than was at one time anticipated-  ----- K&apos;-       &apos; .-.   -  vand moreover there has not &quot;been so large an export to the United States cf&apos;America&apos; as was allowed for owing to the dearth of shipping&apos;;-.&apos;&apos;; The- iticreaBod export of Egyptian cotton to the&quot;IJhTtetH Kingdom mil prove of : ) service to Lancashire spinners, many of whom are how substituting the co&amp;sor varieties of ij;^ptia:i&apos;\etfttbn for American cotton in their millsA fourth census of cotton&apos;, stocks, is being taken shortly by the Cotton Control Boardc    when the resultsOver.
are available it will be possible to reconsider the posi-tioa of the industry in relation to the supply of raw materials.    It nw seems probable that no claim will have to be made on the Treasury for assistance for the Cotton Control Board1a unemployment fund before June 10th, when the present arrangement lapses. ,With a view to preventing,exports to Russia of goods which might toe of service to the enemy the export to Russia (both Asiatic and European) of all goods at present prohibited to neutral countries bordering on enemy &apos;territories has now been prohibited except under licence.Progress has been made in conjunction with the Ministries of Labour and Reconstruction with the arrange-meats for setting up Whitley Councils or failing these, Interim Industrial Beeonstruetion Committees in a large number of trades.    Conferences of representatives of associations of employers (including Traders) and work-people have been held in the Made-up Leather and Belting trade and in the Tanning and Currying Trade.   At the former conference it was agreed to set up a Whitley Council and at the latter an Interim Industrial and Commercial Committee for reconstruction purposes.Questions at issue between the Department and the flay Office with regard to hay have been referred to Sir A. Lee, M.P.. as arbitrator. His award recommends the reconstitution of the Forage Committee and the district committees, and the establishment of a Central Council to make recommendations to the Forage Committee on the subject of civilian requirements.
The heads of a new agreement between the British Government and the Australian Zinc iYodueers for the&apos; supply of Australian zinc concentrates have now. been&quot;, signed.    The new Agreement takes the place of one made in 1917, the terms of which have become unsuitable owing to the changed conditions particularly with regard to tonnage and freights;.,   Under the Agreement IUI, Govern-ment have undertaken to purchase the whole Australian production of zinc concentrates, (subject to certain \ reservations in respect of Australian requirements and existing contracts) up to a maximum annual quantity, which --is 250-,0,00 tons from the 1st January, 1918, to the end of. IS&quot;months&apos;after the termination of the War, and 300,000 tons for 9 years thereafter...The Department has been in touch with an important group of ironmasters in this country who have formed a .project for an arrangement with French interests whereby large supplies of iron ore will be made available for : this country in exchange for coal to be exported to Prance.    The project is only in a preliminary stage but representatives of the group have been to France to in-vestigate ,the conditions on the spot and have made a report.Now that the Report of the Balfour of Burleigh Corn-mi t tee, on Commercial and Industrial Policy has been pub-lished, arrangements are being made to publish forthwith the Reports of the Committees which were appointed to consider the probable, posit ion of certain staple in-, duatries after the V/a^    The $epdrts of the Iron and Steel Trades, Engineering Trades; Textile grades and Bleotrical&apos; Trades Committees are being published immedia-tely, and the Department is in communication with the Chairmen of the Coal Trades and Non-Ferrous ^etal Trades Committees with a view to deciding on any alterations in those Reports that may bo necessary before publication.
\The Report of the Shipping and Shipbuilding TradesCommittee will also U&apos; publishedbut&quot; its exact form isstill uncertain.    &apos;:&apos; ----- &apos;    &quot;&apos;&quot;    &apos;*-&quot;Progress has been made with the re-drafting^&apos; tile Patents, and Designs Si 11-and-the Trademarks Bill&apos;.&apos;- : itis hb?ped that the Bills&apos; in their amended&quot; form will disposeof much of the errtiix&amp;tf nade^iar-the tfase of the previous Bills.&apos; V&apos; &apos;: -&apos;v.;.v ,:&apos; -The -British Aluminium&apos;Company&apos;a (Loohaber ftater Power)proposal to &quot;establish a &quot;&quot;key industry11 on a -firm basis had no jbetter success.

It is regrettable that the
Public Services Administration,Consequent upon a series of meetings which I have had with the Hailway Blxecutive Committee on the subject of the further restriction of railway facilities with a view &apos;.) more especially &apos;to the reduction of passenger traffic, an addition to Defence of the Realm Regulation 7 B, v^.u^rQ?iddlor-on the 27th April authorising the Board of Trade to make Orders in regard to the conditions under which tickets may be issued and   passengers carried,, and enaoling the Railway Companies to! refuse to carry passengers if necessary. The addition to the regulation also deals with the issue of season tickets and the renewal and cancellation of such tickets.   It further provides that Orders may be made enabling Hallway Companies to refuse to accept goods for . carriage by rail? where other means of transport exist,.Tlie Orders to be made under these additions to Regulation 7B involve very difficult considerations both from the point of view of the form they should take and also from the point of view of securing uniformity of action by the lailway Companies.   I contemplate-that a-committee mainly composed of members of the Railway Executive Committee shall deal with the season ticket question in order toensure that differential treatment is not metod out by&apos;  thethe different companies to/people who desire to use their respective systems,.The problem of the future of the Railways is being considered by me with the assistance of expert ad.,ice and conferences on the subject are being held, ,   Pending any action that may be taken as a result of the Report of the Coal Conservation Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee and of that of the Electric Power Supply Committee, under which the possibility of Electric
Supply Schemes on a wide basis is contemplated, I havedecided not to sanction any new proposals for;the estab-34aliment of schemes of a purely local character.Beturns received from .388 Gas Undertakings and 139  GAS ANDElectricity undertakings affected by Part II of the Order 6WH ,give the &quot;following results for the first fortnight duringwhich the Order was in operation, as compared with .the. ,corresponding period in 1917.

The recruitment of the first 50,000 miners is proceeding smoothly and it is understood that the Ministry of Hational Service expect to have posted the whole number to the Colours by the 10th klay.
Difficulties are being experienced in connexion with the recruitment of the second quota owing to the refusal of the miners to agree to the system of recruitment, under which it was proposed to discriminate in favour of tho inland coal-fields - already very short of men - and recruit almost entirely from the exporting districts only.Satisfactory progress is being made with the arrangements in connexion with the proposals for rationing household and industrial consumers of coal to meet the shortage created by recruitment.Goal for Franco.   Arrangements have been made to insure the supply to France of an additional quantity of 280,000 to 530.000 tons monthly (according to circumstances) to meet the situation created by the enemy advance towards the Pas de Calais coalfields.!fIM comm.Qensup of Home Or own Timber.   A Census of standing timber has now been completed.    The result   is only approximate but indicates sufficient supplies of pitwood to last for six years.    iifeture coniferous timber, however, will apparently be exhausted by the Autumn of next year, although sawn hardwoods should sui&apos;fio-j for two to three years after that.Imported Timber,   The Timber Order 1918 dated 23rd   -April, prohibiting private transactions with regard to timber abroad except under permit from the Controller of Timber Supplies has been issued after consultation with the Department interested.    Almost the whole of the importation of timber will now take place through the Timber  upoly Department.(3gd). A.H.STAKLEY.10.5.1918.(?)
