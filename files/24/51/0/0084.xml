CONFIDENTIAL-. Political Intelligence Department,^^^S^MsisT&quot; Foreign Office,^Slj^^^ France /002.iAM^/M) MEMORANDUMONTHE &quot; BONNET ROUGE&quot; TRIAL AND ITS CONNECTION WITH MALVYAND CAILLAUX.THE trial has ended, as was inevitable, in the conviction of the accused. Duval is sentenced to death, the others to terms of imprisonment, varying in length from two years to ten.On the whole, the sixteen clays of the trial produced little evidence of any serious political interest. The &quot;Bonnet Rouge &quot; was an evening paper of &quot;defaitiste &quot; and anti-English tendencies, of which one Almereyda or Vigo was editor, and Duval was manager, as well as a frequent contributor. Duval was detained on the French frontier early in 1917, and found to have on him a German cheque for over 6,000L The cheque was of course seized, but by some means, not even now really explained, it was returned to him after being photographed. The matter came later, almost accidentally, to the knowledge of the then Prime Minister, M. Ribot, with the result that, after further delay, Almereyda and Duval were arrested last August, the first of the long series of arrests on charges of treason which, have followed, culminating in that of M. Caillaux. Almereyda died very mysteriously in prison soon after his arrest. Duval and other members of his gang have lived to be proved guilty of intelligence with the enemy, or complicity in it, and are now to pay the penalty. So far the trial is of no particular interest. All that it means is that some rather disreputable journalists and adventurers who took German money, or worked with those who did, have been caught and convicted.But it has three points of public importance. First, the whole business shows the importance attached by the Germans to getting at public opinion in the Allied countries by means of the purchase of the press. In this case as in that of &quot; Le Journal,&quot; which figured in the Bolo trial and will figure still more in that of the Senator Humbert, the Germans paid large sums of money for the purpose of controlling French papers. &quot; Le Journal&quot; was to be moulded to their uses, though, so far as one -can judge, it never actually was. The &quot; Bonnet Rouge &quot; was ready made to their hand, and only needed support and development. It was Caillauxist, pro-German, and anti-English before the war. On the outbreak of the war it indulged in a spell of patriotism, after which, and especially after Duval joined it, it took to its natural business of sowing distrust, discouragement, and disparagement of the Allies, and fomenting class feeling and unrest among the army and people, wherever it could .get a hearing. With a paper called &quot;La Tranchee Republicaine,&quot; belonging to the same group, it carried on a mischievous propaganda at the front, Avhich even led to mutinies, and produced repeated protests from Generals Nivelle and Petain. In fact it did the work for which Duval received, as he has admitted, though of course giving other reasons for its receipt, some 40,0001.But what is more interesting perhaps and certainly more astonishing is the assistance it received from those who did not receive 40,000L or indeed anything at all from the German banker-agent, Marx. Here we come to greater personages than the obscure Duval. We come to M. Malvy, Minister of the Interior from the outbreak of the war till the Almereyda-Duval affair compelled his resignation last August; to M. Malvy who is soon to stand his own trial before the Senate, and is represented in this by his former &quot;chef de cabinet,&quot; M. Leymarie, who was one of the accused and has been sentenced to two years&apos; imprisonment; and to a still greater man, M. Caillaux, whose name has often been mentioned in the trial at the end of which he appeared as a witness.Let us take Malvy first. He did. not appear in this trial, and of course his defence will not be made public till his own trial takes place. But he was the Minister responsible for the doings of the officials of his Ministry, and of the &quot; Surete Nationale,&quot; and it is, to say the least, astonishing to foreigners to find him subsidising the &quot; Bonnet Rouge &quot; for some time, in close relations with Almereyda, accepting [367-13]
the recommendations of the prisoner Marion, a person twice convicted for. swindling and once for desert ion, and on these recommendations allowing Duval to make ten journeys to Switzerland for the known purpose of meeting the German banker Marx, besides permitting another prisoner, Touela, also of the &quot;Bonnet Rouge&quot; office, to go to Spain, where he immediately went to the German consulate at Barcelona and offered an article for a pro-German paper published there. It is strange to find, too, his confidential subordinate, the prisoner Ley marie, overriding the express instructions of the Ministers of War arid Foreign Affairs, and even a formal order of Malvy himself, that&apos;no passports were to be issued to Duval, and continually refusing the urgent requests of General Pel am and the army authorities that steps would be taken to put a stop to the &quot;clefaitiste&quot; press campaign carried on by the &quot;Bonnet Rouge&quot; and other papers among the troops. No doubt Malvy did not know of all these things personally, but they were done under his authority, and Leymarie is stated by the army authorities to have invariably encouraged all the pacifist press and done nothing whatever to assist the High Command to stamp out &quot; defaitisme.&quot; Nor was any change made till Leymarie, who had cut off all direct communication between his department and the army, left the Ministry of the Interior. The damning fact that it was Leymarie who gave the passports to Duval, that it was lie who allowed the cheque to be returned to him, that Goldsky and Landau, two of the other prisoners now convicted, had sufficient influence with Leymarie to have been able to get the passport for Dumas, have proved fatal to Leymarie himself, and can hardly fail to be damaging to Malvy. Leymarie was not accused by the prosecuting counsel of deliberate crime. He was accused and has been found guilty of allowing what counsel called his &quot; mauvaise camaraderie &quot; to induce him to commit acts, in particular the granting of the passport and the return of the cheque, which amount to complicity in treason.Malvy&apos;s trial is yet to come and will take place before the Senate, that is under conditions possibly more favourable to an ex-Minister than those of a military court. But the present revelations cannot do him any good ; they must predisj)ose the public, and even perhaps the Senate itself, against him. Whatever the result of his trial, it seems incredible that, unless France loses the war, a man who is shown to have made the Ministry of the Inferior a place of resort for persons who were subsequently convicted of being directly or indirectly agents employed by Germany for the defeat of their own country, whose most trusted subordinate was sentenced to two years&apos; imprisonment for his connection with these men, and, more than all, who was himself in close relations with at least one of them (Almereyda), should ever again hold, high office in France. Political memories are short in ail countries, but it is difficult to believe that they could be so short as that.Finally, there is Caillaux. What bearing has the trial on him ? Well, broadly speaking, it has the same effect on his position as it has on Malvy&apos;s. One may have the misfortune to have a single friend or acquaintance convicted of treason even that does not improve a man&apos;s reputation ; but to have half a dozen ! Malvy&apos;s jjosition is in one respect worse, for his discreditable relations, direct and indirect, with this gang of scoundrels were official. Caillaux&apos;s were merely personal, and so far less serious. He gave no passports and returned no cheques. But, on the other hand, Caillaux not only shares with Malvy all the discredit of having been mixed up with such a crew; in his case there is the allegation, which there is not in Malvys, so far as any evidence in this trial goes, of his having been in direct and personal relations with agents of the enemy. Take the minor point first. Caillaux pretends that all financial connection between him and the &quot; Bonnet Rouge &quot; ceased before the war, but he does not deny that he supplied it with funds at the time of his wifes trial; and it is notorious that its editor, Almereyda, not merely made an active defence of Mine. Caillaux, but organised a collection of ruffians, who had a whole series of political convictions against them, to be a &quot; Corsican bodyguard &quot; for Caillaux. Moreover, it always supported Caillaux&apos;s pro-German policy. And the evidence in this trial shows clearly enough that the political relations between him and the &quot; Bonnet Eouge &quot; world continued during the war. Four of tbe prisoners, Duval, Marion, Landau, and Goldsky, are found visiting him in the country where, as the counsel said, they may not have been received cordially, but they were nevertheless received and invited to drink some of the great man&apos;s port wine. It is not necessary to go into details. It is plain that, speaking generally, the whole gang looked up to Caillaux, whom they called the &quot;President.&quot; Well, it is not an advantage to a man about to be tried for treason to have several of his acquaintances and political supporters found guilty on the same charge ; nor can it be an advantage to a politician aspiring to govern his country to be proved to have leaned on the support of traitors.
As for the more serious point. The man who paid Duval was, as Duval admits, a Mannheim banker, named Marx, the note on whom, at the French War Office is that he is now established at Borne Tor the purpose of managing&apos; financial transactions in which the German Legation does not wish to appear. It is this person whom the German Government tried to use as intermediary with Caillanx. Two documents were seized in M. Caillaux&apos;s strong-box at Florence. One says this : &quot; M. Lippscher does not appear desirable as intermediary. I place myself at your disposal, and am authorised to establish the relations you desire.&quot; This document was typed. The other, in handwriting, simply contained the words &quot; II. A. Marx, care of Professor Erzberg, 27, Steinerstrasse, Berne.&quot; The writing is believed to be proved to be that of Marx himself, The explanation of these documents is this : Lippscher was an old acquaintance of Caillaux, and one of his witnesses at his wi:i&apos;e&apos;s trial. He had tried in 1915, according to Caillaux&apos;s own statement, to open political communications with Caillaux, and had invited him to come to Switzerland with a view apparently to discussing peace. Caillaux asserts that he did not reply for some time, and then only to refuse, and that he spoke to M. Briand, then Prime Minister, on the subject. Later came the further attempt made by a person who called on M. Caillaux at his house in Paris, alleging financial business, and on entering presented the two documents already quoted, on which, according to M, Caillaux, lie was at once shown out. But, as the Government counsel severely comments, he was neither arrested nor even reported to the authorities. Nor were the documents which on the face of them imply communications with the enemy handed over to the Government. On the contrary, they were preserved by M. Caillaux, and merely annotated by him &quot; Conversations refused.&quot; Nor did his evidence as to the elate on which he first heard of Marx appear to agree with his previous statements, while it was fiercely contradicted by some of the prisoners.Caillaux&apos;s innocence or guilt must remain an open question for Englishmen till his trial. But these revelations can scarcely help him with public opinion. He claims that he was entitled to do anything he could to assist in peace negotiations ; and if he had consulted or continued to consult the Government about them, so no doubt he was. But M. Briand does not appear to have any recollection of having been shown Lippscher&apos;s letter ; and in any case the desire to serve France in peace negotiations, even if admitted, would not cover the concealing of the presence of a German emissary in Paris.On the whole, the trial can scarcely fail to discredit further the whole Caillaux-Malvy party, and those sections of the Extreme Left who have all through made themselves their champions in Parliament and in the press, and have during these proceedings made no effort to conceal their bias in favour of the prisoners and against the prosecuting counsel. This memorandum is being written before French comments on the verdict have arrived. But it seems inevitable that, whatever attempts to save faces may be made, the result, as a whole must be to arouse the country still further to the clanger of the &quot; defaitiste &quot; propaganda, to make those who pursue it themselves, or defend those who do, still more suspect in the eyes of patriotic Frenchmen, and above all to strengthen the hands of M. Clemenceau, who before he took office led the attack on Malvy which caused Malvy&apos;s fall, and as soon as he became head of the Government proceeded with the utmost vigour to insist that the whole nest of suspected traitors, including the powerful and dangerous Caillaux himself, should be brought to their trial, and by the proof of their guilt or innocence should deliver the army and the nation from the fear of being stabbed in the back at the very crisis of the fate of France. That can hardly have anything but a good effect on the moral both of the soldiers and of the people.
