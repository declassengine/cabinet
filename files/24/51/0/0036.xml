7f*s^^ is the Property.of His Britannic Mqjeatfs Government?STATEMENTS OF GERMAN POLITICAL AIMS SINCE THE WESTERNOFFENSIVE  BEGAN.THROUGHOUT the summer of 1917 a vigorous campaign was waged by the leaders of the &quot; peace by understanding &quot; movement in the various political camps of the Reichstag Majority Parties in favour of a public renunciation of all claims to indemnities or annexations. This campaign culminated in the Resolution passed by the Majority in the Reichstag last July 19. In that Resolution it was declared that &quot; The Reichstag, rejecting every idea of the acquisition of territory by force, aims at peace by understanding and the lasting reconciliation of all nations. Political, economic, or financial measures of coercion are imcompatible with such a peace.&quot; The vote for the Resolution was 214 against 116. The leading exponents of the Resolution in the country were Erzberger, of the Catholic Centre, Dernburg, the former Secretary of State for the Colonies, Scheidemann (Majority Socialist), and Radicals like Conrad Haussmann, the Wurttemberger. After the Resolution had been passed, its precise meaning became a subject of violent controversy, which helped to overthrow the Chancellor, Michaelis, after he, under pressure from the Majority, had declared his adhesion to the Resolution, &quot; as I understand it.&quot; There was also some doubt regarding the attitude of the bulk of the Catholic Centre, and certain members of that party could go about the country declaring that &quot;the Resolution did not exclude the possibility of Germany nevertheless here and there receiving extensions of territory, nor did it exclude Germany getting an indemnity.&apos;&apos;It was originally understood that Herr von Kuhlmann went into the. Brest-Litovsk negotiations on the basis of the Reichstag Resolution, but it speedily became apparent that the military leaders and the Pan-Germans and other advocates of annexation had obtained decisive influence over the negotiations. They were finally broken off, and Germany&apos;s terms were ultimately imposed upon the Russians by force. It is argued by the Germans that the encroachments which Germany has made upon Russian territory do not as yet amount to forcible annexations; that they represent the liberation of nationalities like the Ukrainians, the Lithuanians,, the Letts, the Baltic Germans, the Esthonians, and the Finns, in accordance with their own desire, and with the assent in general terms of the Russian Bolshevik Government. But, in the first place, the way in which Germany has acted makes it perfectly plain that what she is doing is essentially to subject these new frontier States to a German protectorate, political and economic, which is designed to secure for her all the advantages without the responsibilities of annexation. Under one pretext or another, she is maintaining and extending her military occupation of . Russian territory, the latest extension being into the Crimea. The assistance given to the present Finnish Government against the Red Guards is likewise being ex-hibited in its true light by the terms of the Treaty of Peace concluded with Finland, and the anxieties which it has begun to create among the Finns themselves, as well as the Swedes, regarding plans for the complete political, military, and economic domination of the Baltic and its coasts by Germany.Secondly, the word is being suited to the action, and schemes of aggrandisement, extension of influence and annexation are now being openly proclaimed by leading German speakers and writers. The frankness with which these ambitions are avowed has increased since the beginning of the Western offensive, but the Germans have always had many irons in the fire, and they can point to the fact that no scheme which was once regarded, as wild, and which they now regard as practical, ever lacked advocates in Germany.   The wilder avowals of to-day may thus become
the practical policy of to-morrow. After the experience of the collapse of Russia the idea has been widely accepted that policy will be decided by the fortune of the German arms on the Western front, and that the military leaders must have a decisive voice in the peace terms.To take, first, the question of indemnities. The demand for eventual indeinnh ties had been once more raised by responsible and influential speakers months before the Western offensive. Tims, as far back as the last week in November, 1917, the Finance Minister of Saxony had declared in the Saxon Chamber of Deputies that: &quot; Germany must demand a war indemnity without bothering about whether her adversaries could pay it; let them only think of America. Indemnities were the best means of preventing future wars.&quot;The same Minister is now publicly agitating in favour of a policy of indemnities. Speaking at a meeting at Dresden on 11th April, he said: &quot; The most appropriate means of preventing the nation from becoming exhausted is a war indemnity. We have the right to demand that the enemy make amends, for war was forced upon us. It is our duty to our people, too, to hang the weight of milliards around the necks of those who conjured up the war. There is less doubt than ever to-day concerning our power to obtain a war indemnity.&quot;This view was stated in a more extreme form in the Upper House of the Prussian Diet on the 10th April by Prince Salm-Horstmar, who declared: &quot; Poland must bear a due proportion of our war costs. But vje must also demand war indemnities from the rest of our enemies. They must pay till they are black in the face, so that they may be weakened for at least 100 years. The leaden weight of the milliards of which IIerr Heljferich srpohe is not to be trailed about by us, but by our enemies.&quot;According to the Kreuzzeitung,&quot; the leading Junker organ, all parties are gradually recognising the necessity of demanding an indemnity in money. A prominent Radical, Herr Miiller, the Reichstag Deputy for Meiningen, who leads his party in the Bavarian Chamber, has just published a pamphlet which, the Radical &quot; Berliner Tageblatt &quot; describes as &quot; throwing the July Resolution over-board,&quot; and therefore, presumably, favouring the demand for indemnities.The Majority Social Democrats are not one whit behindhand, although they state their views somewhat differently. The &quot; Muncliner Post,&quot; and other Socialist newspapers, have recently published an article from which the following extracts we taken: &quot; In all parties there are probably men who are convinced that an annexa-tionist peace in the West as a supplement to the annexationist peace in the East would not be for Germany&apos;s good, but there is no solid majority in the Reichstag which is acting consistently in this conviction. If the action in the West closes with a complete military success, if Prance and England can really be forced to submit to the conditions imposed upon them by the conqueror, then it is improbable that the Reichstag will appear as a deciding factor. Minorities are powerless, and can do nothing more than protest.&quot;This is a frank confession that there is now in the Reichstag no majority against annexations and indemnities. Indeed, according to the &quot; Hamburger  Correspondent,&quot; negotiations are in progress between the Government and the Reichstag, which will presently result in the explicit abandonment of the so-called &quot; Peace Resolution &quot; of last July. A prosecution of Erzberger for his share in secur-ing the adoption of the Resolution is even contemplated. He is said to have secured the adhesion of his party, the Centre, to the Resolution by producing a letter which he alleged had been written by Czernin to the Emperor Charles, insisting that Austria absolutely must have peace before the winter of 1917. The Catholic &quot; Germania,&quot; a paper which reflects the views of Hertling&apos;s party, has described the Resolution as having been merely intended to trap the Bolsheviks.Meanwhile, the idea that - Germany must demand war indemnities from the Western Powers, apart from the territory she must annex in order to make her frontier secure, is being insinuated into the minds of the German people by articles
in newspapers, speeches by politicians, and all the usual means of propaganda. The services even of a Royal Prince have been enlisted. Prince Frederick William of Prussia, a cousin of the Kaiser, speaking at the opening of a Courland exhibition at Breslau, on the 12th April, said:-&quot; The renewed sacrifices we have been compelled to make by the stubborn-ness of our opponents, who disdainfully rejected the hand of peace held out to them, justify us in demanding an economic and financial indemnification. It is only right and just that they who started the war (this after the publication of Lichnowsky&apos;s memorandum and Muhlon&apos;s explicit statements!) should pay the bill. We need such indemnities, moreover, for our economic development and to ensure our economic future. If our industry is rendered incapable of competing with that of other countries, and our agriculture is hampered by an excessive burden of taxation, the consequences must be that workmen and their families will have no bread, and will be exposed to terrible privations. No German who has the good of his country at heart can wish that our workmen, who have accomplished such great things at the front and at home, in such difficult conditions, shall be exposed to want through the instrumentality of a lame peace.&quot;The Conservative and the Pan-German press naturally abound in the sense of these declarations. Thus, the Free Conservative and Pan-German &quot; Deutsche Zeitung &quot; insists: &quot; We must exercise an iron pressure on England to secure all the raw material we need. If we do not achieve this we shall have lost the war. We must obtain a large indemnity from England, part of which must be paid in raw materials, of which we must demand three times the quantity we imported annually before the war. Finally, we must refuse to stop the U-boat war or to evacuate France before the raw material is landed either at Bremea or Hamburg, and our terms must be that for each ship-load we receive we will evacuate one French town, or alternatively allow one ship-load of supplies to reach England unmolested by our submarines. Unless we do these things Germany will be ruined.&quot;Judging from the attitude of a spokesman of the Berlin business world, like Dernburg, it might have been supposed that German business men took a saner view of the prospects of Germany&apos;s recouping herself by indemnities. But recently, in the first flush, doubtless, of the Western successes, certain prominent representatives of the financial world have begun to fall into the tone of the Pan-Germans. Thus the Dresdener Bank, one of the biggest concerns in Berlin, in presenting its annual report and balance sheet, says: &quot; While this is being written the success obtained in the fight under gifted leadership against our Western enemies, in connection with the success of our U-boats, justifies the hope of a peace which will not only make the future of Germany and her colonies secure, but will also transfer from the shoulders of the German people a considerable portion of the heavy financial burden which devolves upon them through the war.&quot;The Disconto-Gesellschaft, a still bigger banking concern, after assuming in its annual report the final success of the German arms, expresses the hope that there will be no direct levy on capital. Yet the taxation of capital and income and the taxes on production and consumption will impose heavy burdens on German economic life. It is, therefore, hoped that a portion of the cost of the war will be transferred to Germany&apos;s enemies.II.The treatment of the question of annexations is a barometer of the opinion which prevails in authoritative quarters regarding the prospects of complete military success. Before the Western offensive began, there prevailed, as regards the terri-torial future of Poland, an impression that the new State would be treated generously on its western frontier, that any rectifications of frontier which might be undertaken, in the interests of the military security of Germany, would be slight, and that on the
east it would obtain a &quot;window towards Russia &quot; so as to enable it to maintain to-some extent its economic relations with that country. Meanwhile, in the Lower House of the Prussian Diet, representatives of the Prussian Poles had taken occasion to emphasise their strong national standpoint, and the uncompromising language which they had employed was made the pretext for a political offensive by the annexationists in the Upper House on the 9th April, and for an unusually violent speech by the Government spokesman, Herr von Eisenhart-Rothe, the Prussian Minister of Agriculture. The Minister said: &quot; The strength of our eastern frontier is, in the first place, a Prussian interest. Prussia can demand that in the treaties as to this frontier military interests should be regarded as of decisive importance, even though they involved the disadvantage of not inconsiderably increasing the number of Poles in Prussia who would not bring their will into harmony with that of the Prussian State. As to the actual conditions of peace, such as war indemnities, and the taking over of Polish domains, &amp;c., I will say nothing, but only emphasise that agreements as to peace must be made between Government and Government, and that private persons, even if they be Parliamentary leaders, have no say in the matter.  In this I know that I am in agreement with the Chancellor.&quot;This ministerial declaration is universally interpreted, first, as foreshadowing annexations on a large scale at the expense of Poland; and, secondly, as denying the right of the Reichstag majority to interfere by any manifestations of its opinion such, as the July Resolution.As to the extent of the contemplated annexations, Eisenhart-Rothe&apos;s words are, according to the &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung &quot; (the 12th April), interpreted as meaning that the numbers of the population to be annexed would &quot; run into seven figures.&quot; There are said to be three military schemes of annexation. The first would affect 500,000, the second 800,000, and the third over 2,000,000 Poles.&apos;Such schemes are only in accordance with the views of the dominant Junker clique, whose resolution adopted by the Upper House of the Prussian Diet, urged upon the Government &quot;that in the still outstanding agreements as to the future frontiers of the Kingdom of Poland, considerations for the military security of Prussia shall form the fundamental principle of all negotiations.&quot;It is understood that Ludendorff, whose influence, even with his opponents of the Socialist Majority Party, is ever on the ascendant, advocates a policy of extensive annexation. Indeed, one of the speakers in the Upper House, Dr. Korte, Burgo-master of Konigsberg, told the House: &quot; If we adopt these proposals, we shall have the support of General Ludendorff, who celebrates his fifty-third birthday to-day.&quot;It may be added that the Conservatives in the Prussian Upper House proposed and carried (the 9th April) a rider to the Annexation Resolution, to the following effect: &quot; The requisite, means for this military security, and the necessary means for providing for war invalids, and for an economic and cultural reconstruction that will preserve the financial resources of the country, can only be obtained if a sufficient war indemnity is proposed at the conclusion of peace.&quot;The Pan-Germans and annexationists always put forward the case of the war invalids. Their object is to render the idea of indemnities popular with the masses., and to counteract their war-weariness, which is intensified by the suspicion that the war is being prolonged for the sake of money and territorial conquests. Many of the speeches delivered in the Upper House debate were calculated to encourage these suspicions. Thus, Count York von Wartenburg, the bearer of a famous Prussian name, complained that &quot; in spite of all that the occupying Powers had done, the Polish army (on which Germany appears to have counted for her own purposes) had not been raised, and the (Polish) State Council had resigned when the Polish Legions were ordered back to the front, whereas Polish Legions from Chicago had landed at Bordeaux . . .; . The State of Frederick the Great and Bismarck had risen to greatness, not by renunciation and understanding, but by force of arms. If there was such a thing as a right to self-determination, it belonged to the German people.&quot;
In a previous debate in the Reichstag, the 19th March, on the eve of the Western offensive, the Conservative leader, Count Westarp, said that the only real promise the Poles had made was that they &quot; would be ready to conclude an economic alliance and a military convention with Germany.&quot;&quot; But,&quot; he added, &quot;the Majority Parties of Poland are not behind this promise. They are rather against it .... It cannot be assumed that the new Polish State aims at an honourable connection with Germany. It may be a tragic circumstance, but Germany, owing to her own vital interests, cannot grant the Poles the fulfilment of their desires.&quot;As to the requisite territorial security towards the East &quot; the character and extent of this security must be shaped in accordance with the judgment of our military command, and it would be a crime for Germany toreject such security out of regard for political considerations. If you call such frontier securities annexations, it is all the same to us.&quot;The last few clays have shown how Germany interprets her relations with the Ukraine, with which she concluded a treaty professing to recognise the independence of that country. That treaty, however, imposed upon the Ukrainian People&apos;s Republic a forced levy of foodstuffs, to be collected for the Central Powers under State control. The German army of occupation, which entered the country with, the professed object of restoring order, supporting the Rada, and expelling the Bolshevist troops, is now being used to enforce a German dictatorship, of which the instruments are Field-Marshal von Eichhorn, Commander-in-Chief of that army; the German Minister-Resident, Baron Mumm von Schwarzenstein; and General Groner, formerly at the head of the German National Service Department, and now Collector-General in the Ukraine. As it has been found impossible to extract from the peasants the supplies which Germany expected, Field-Marshal von Eichhorn recently issued a decree that they were to proceed with their spring sowing, and that they were to return all the property, which, during the revolutionary movement, they had taken from the landlords. The result apparently has been a fresh revolution, the peasant Deputies, according to the first accounts, having upset the Rada Government and established themselves in its place. That Government, the Germans complain, had not given sufficient support to the German efforts to restore order, and had even joined in the agitation against them. The arrest of Dobry, the manager of the Russian Bank for Foreign Trade, who was associated with the German efforts to exploit the -country, is regarded as an act of anarchy. Field-Marshal von Eichhorn has, there-fore, with the approval, of the German Minister, taken special measures for the security of Kieff. His intention is to establish military tribunals, and to secure the punishment of criminals, and the imposition of severe penalties for all disturbances of public order. Meanwhile, a German military tribunal has instituted an inquiry into the Dobry case, which has led to the arrest of the Ukrainian War Minister, M. Shukowsky; the Departmental Chief of the Ministry of the Interior, M. Dajeviky; Mine. Katchenko, wife of the Minister of the Interior; the Departmental Chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and others. Finally, a new Government, under the certified &quot; pro-German,&quot; Skoropadsky, seems to have been setup. The Main Committee of the Reichstag has resolved to request the Chancellor to giveexpianations of these events; they certainly bear the aspect of a German military administration of the country, and seem to be altogether inconsistent with the terms of the Peace Treaty.The German occupation has extended south and eastwards to Odessa, the national connection of which, with the Ukraine, is exceedingly doubtful, and into the Crimea, including Sebastopol, which has no national or political connection whatever with the Ukraine.In the case of Lithuania, the Germans have doubtless a better political basis to work upon in retaining control of the country. Hertling&apos;s reply to a deputation from that essentially unrepresentative body, the Lithuanian National Council, which he received in Berlin on the 24th March, could refer to the Council&apos;s declaration of 11th December last, in which it declared Lithuania to be an independent State &quot; united with Germany in perpetual and close alliance in traffic, monetary, and other spheres,&quot; and asked for &quot; Germany&apos;s protection and help in the reconstruction of the State.&quot; The Chancellor accordingly undertook to give the desired assistance, and &quot; in concert with the Lithuanian population, to take the necessary measures and
conventions for the establishment of Confederation with the German Empire/&apos; (Bundnissverhaltniss im Deutschen Reich.)   He added &quot; The German Government presupposes that the Convention will be made &apos; to Germany&apos;s interest as well as Lithuania^, and that Lithuania will take a share of Germani/s war burdens, which are promoting Lithuanians emancipa-tion.&quot;This &quot; emancipation &quot; of the border territories from Russia seems, in all cases, to mean the substitution of one kind or another of German supremacy for Russian. When the Lithuanian Deputation arrived in Berlin, they were informed before seeing the Chancellor that, if they did not accept the German conditions, Germany would simply proceed to annex their country. They therefore, in the circumstances, decided to abandon their objections to the far-reaching demands of Germany, and to agree to a military convention, an economic convention, community of coinage, and German control of the Lithuanian railways, post, and telegraphs, it is reported that the Ukrainian Government consider this surrender on the part of their northern neighbour to represent the conversion of Lithuania into a mere dependency of Germany, and the further encirclement of their own country by spheres of German influence.The &quot; Kreuzzeitung &quot; (Junker), of the 14th April, in an article by a well-informed correspondent, deprecates the idea of erecting Lithuania into an indepen-dent principality, whether the future sovereign were a Duke of Urach, a Saxon Prince, or a Hohenzollern. The reason alleged is that the new Court would ultimately become Polish, as there is no non-Polish Society capable of forming a Court in Lithuania. The only solution is a personal union with Prussia, where, as history shows, every concession to the Poles soon finds its limits in the vital necessities of the State. This is not the case with other German States. Saxony, Wiirttemberg, and the rest, might possibly enter upon a pro-Polish policy-of course, it is not maintained that they would. but their own skins would not suffer from the harm that would result. On the other hand, a pro-Polish policy in Lithuania is dangerous, not only for Prussia, but most of all for the Lithuanians themselves. Here Prussia&apos;s interests are absolutely identical with those of Lithuania.Livonia, Esthonia, Couriand, and Oesel.The General Landesrat of these territories, a body which claims, on no real grounds, to represent their whole population, having addressed a telegram to the Kaiser thanking him for &quot;their rescue from the heaviest affliction,&quot; and &quot; unanimously begging him to unite the Baltic lands to the German Empire for all time &quot;; the Emperor replied on the 15th April, that he heartily thanks God &quot;for allowing me and my armies to be the instrument of this liberation, and for enabling me to piace on a safe basis the future of the old country created by German labour. The request of the National Council for union under my sceptre will be benevolently considered.&quot;Hertling and Kuhlmann are said to be opposed to the union of Esthonia and Livonia with Germany or Prussia, especially as this would constitute a breach of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Russia, which contemplates the ultimate exclusion of these countries from the German sphere of influence. Hertling has been at head-quarters, and is said&quot; to have had differences of opinion with the Emperor on this subject. The Esths are opposed to the action of the General Landesrat, which claims to represent them, and an Esthonian delegation has been sent to Stockholm to urge their views. The Socialist Esthonian Deputy, Martha, a member of this delegation, has informed a representative of the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung &quot; that, while the Esths have no antipathy to German Kultur, they cannot but be hostile to the &quot;Baltic German nobility and to the German Baltic bourgeoisie, which, following in its train, is ranging itself against us. This aristocracy has oppressed us for centuries . . . There can be no doubt that, but for the melancholy experiences which they had of the Baltic nobility, the Esthonian people would have full confidence in the German Empire (this is, of course, a German report of the conversation), although even in that case they would not consider a complete union of Esthonia with Germany desirable,&quot;The Esthonian and Livonian deputation arrived on the 22nd April at Main Headquarters, and was received by Hertling, who expressed thanks for the confidence expressed in the Kaiser by the resolution of the Landesrat (United National Council
of Livonia, Esthonia, Riga, and Oesel), and announced the Kaiser&apos;s readiness to take under the military protection of the Empire the countries represented by the Landesrat, and to support them in their endeavour to separate from Russia.  Cert-ling finally declared, in. the Kaisers name, his readiness to recognise the separated regions as an autonomous State. The Landesrafs desire for a uniform monarchical constitutional State in personal union with the Crown of Prussia would, he said, be graciously.considered by the Emperor, and the all-highest&apos;s decision would shortly be communicated to the Landesrat.This looks like a surrender by Hertling in essentials to the annexationists. It also represents a contemplated fresh breach of treaty engagements by Germany, In the Reichstag (20th-21st March) the question of the Baltic territories which lie east of the agreed boundary line was threshed out. The Conservatives tried to make out that the statements made on behalf, of the German Foreign Office did not agree with the view of the majority of the Committee, that these territories were still under Russian sovereignty (Oberhoheit). Erzberger ultimately insisted upon a fresh official statement, and maintained that &quot; the Government has spoken out quite clearly. Esthonia and Livonia are still within the jurisdiction of the Russian State. If they want to secede, then a Russian act is necessary. It is quite a mistake to suppose that any Landesrat of Livonia or Esthonia could one-sidedly resolve upon secession from the Russian State jurisdiction. If we were to adopt the standpoint that through such one-sided resolutions attachment to Germany could be brought about, that would be a direct violation of the treaty.&quot;Erzberger, therefore, insisted upon a clear statement, and added, the singular observation: &quot; To keep treaties truly and honestly is, and must remain, the German custom &quot; (sic).Thus cornered, the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, von dem Busche, confessed &quot; What Dr. Junck (the Reporter of the Committee) has reported is absolutely the standpoint of the Foreign Office. The territories, Esthohia and Livonia, are still under the sovereignty (Oberhoheit) of Russia.&quot;After the Chancellor&apos;s cynical repudiation of this &quot; standpoint &quot; a month later, on the 22nd April, at Headquarters, the &quot; Kolnische Zeitung &quot; was evidently instructed to make some attempt to reconcile the new German policy with the Brest-Litovsk Treaty. It says on the 30th April: &quot; The German Government takes the standpoint that the Russian Soviet Goverment has from the first proclaimed the right of self-determination as its foremost principle, and that this Russian conception was one of the determining factors in the Chancellor&apos;s statement. The Peace Treaty is in no way contra-dictory to the Chancellors promise that the Empire&apos;s military protection shall be given to these lands, and that they shall be assisted in their aspirations towards independence. The German attitude is in accordance with the present Russian Governments own ideals. A decisive act regarding the relationship of those peoples to Germany will only be undertaken when the question of separation from Russia has been decided.&quot;As a matter of fact, the Russian Soviet Government had insisted that any decision with regard to the future political status of territories which might claim the right of self -determination should be based upon a consultation of the popular will in such countries, expressed through popularly elected assemblies, and not through bodies like the Landesrat, which is essentially the organ of a ruling minority based upon caste and property, and out of sympathy with the national aspirations of the Esths and Letts. (Cf. Brest-Litovsk Peace, article VI.)Note -The Pan-German Conservative and National Liberal Press generally advocate the union of all these countries with the Prussian Crown.The Western Front. Belgium, Longwy, and Briey.Since the Western offensive began, the question of eventual German annexations on the West has once more come into prominence, and it is evident that the campaign against Kuhlmann, which sometimes involves Hertling as well, is partly based upon.
the belief that he is an opponent of annexations on the West. Among the more extravagant utterances with regard to Belgium is that of Lieutenant-General Keirn, who was for f6\ years Governor of the Belgian province of Limbnrg, and was pro-minently connected with the Navy League and the Pan-German agitation. He is reported by the &quot; Kreuzzeitung &quot; (10th April) as having told the Deutscher Wehrverein that the proposal to restore Belgium was &quot;simply monstrous.&quot; He scouted the idea of &quot;paying,&quot; when &quot; they had simply treated &quot;Belgium according to the law of war.&quot; He proceeded &quot; The Belgian question is the question of Germany&apos;s fate. BethmannV remark about&apos; wrong &apos; had, unfortunately, put it on a wrong track. The present Chancellor is willing to content himself with &apos; guarantees &apos; against future intrigues-but such guarantees are dreams and bubbles. If we evacuate Belgium, she will at once break any such treaties, knowing quite well that we could net begin a new world-war on that account. And what form would mili-tary guarantees take? An independent State will not put up with foreign soldiers; this only leads to continual acts of murder. Is there to be a Belgian standing army as well? Are we to take possession of fortresses? They would be of little use without a Hinterland. To take over the railway, postal, and tele-graph services would result in endless friction. The case is no better with, economic guarantees, in no circumstances can they prevent the German merchant of the future from being treated as a criminal, and ultimately being wiped out. And how is one to conceive political guarantees, unless we have Belgium in our power? All such guarantees are discussed in the most superficial manner; all are built upon sand. The Chancellor should just tell us what practical measures will prevent Belgium, if we hand it over, from being a hostile base for con-centrating to attack us (Aufmarschgebiet). Such utterances of the Government are knives without blade or haft. To give up Belgium is to abandon the Flemings, upon whom a frightful penalty would fall. The Flemish Coast is indispensable for us. But without a Hinterland it could not be held twenty-four hours.&quot;Lieutenant-General Keim endorsed Bissing&apos;s programme, illustrated the importance of Belgium for Germany&apos;s future fate, exposed the hypocrite Wilson, who had not yet been described, in his true colours by the Chancellor or the Deputies, and, finally, emphasised the necessity of a German peace with indemnities.The expression &quot; a German Peace &quot; has, by the way, been consecrated by no less an authority than Hinclenburg himself who, in his reply to a message of gratitude and encouragement from the Reichstag on the occasion of the Western offensive, telegraphed on the 2nd April that the British and French must not think that the fresh sacrifices which they had compelled the Germans to make would be &quot; for nothing.&quot; He continued: &quot;With the army I know that the Reichstag understands this desire of the brave men at the front, the best sons of the people, and that for its part it will also champion a strong German peace, which alone can preserve us from war in the future.&quot;What is far more remarkable, however, than the views of Pan-German fire-brands like General Keim on the question of Belgium, is the revised attitude of so staunch an organ of the parliamentary Left as the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung.&quot; On the 5th April that journal criticised the pre-war idea of neutrality as &quot; antiquated &quot; and as no longer corresponding to the conditions of modern war. The Belgian Government prided itself on having delayed the German advance and made the victory;,of the Marne possible. Thus it did not merely defend its neutrality. Yet if it had not acted as it did it would have been reproached by the other side with having supported Germany.&quot; Political neutrality can therefore only be observed if Belgium does not possess any armed forces which could awaken in her the ambition to play the part of the tongue of the balance.   If Belgium wants to recover her neutrality, itis only conceivable on that condition......If Belgium desires to possessan army in future, then her sham neutrality must be abolished and her liberty to conclude alliances openly declared. The&apos;clear situation thus created would enable Germany to frame &quot;her policy accordingly and to draw the necessary conclusions betimes in the treaty of peace.&quot;
11ms even the Radical type of German wolf will not allow any future measures of defence to protect the Belgian lamb from its attentions.The Catholic Centre is little or no better. Eight hundred Centre delegates from the Rhine provinces met in the first week of April at Cologne, and the leading speaker, Herr Trimborn, Reichstag Deputy for Cologne, declared that, since all overtures had failed, victory must bring&apos; peace. He was convinced that &quot; the peace terms which will emerge (on the West), like the peace terms in the East, will be approved by the Party and its deputies. At any rate we have no need to disagree about our foreign policy, neither about the East, nor about the West.&quot;Radical Deputies are speaking in the same sense. At a public meeting of the Progressive Party at Hirschberg (reported in.the Radical &quot;Berliner Tageblatt &quot; of the 7th April), the Reichstag Deputy, Dr. Ablass, emphasised the fact that the foreign policy adopted by the Reichstag had justified itself and obtained successes as was proved by the peaces concluded in the East. He then defended the often-attacked peace Resolution, which had been at the time an absolute necessity. It had been necessary to pass the Resolution in order to prove to the German people and its Austro-Hungarian allies that it was no desire for annexations on the part of Germany that was responsible for the prolongation of the war. The peaces concluded in the East and the successes attained by them were a vindication of the Reichstag and its foreign policy. But the Resolution was not an unalterable programme, it was not an offer to the enemy to which the Reichstag had bound itself for all time. &quot; After the enemy&apos;s refusal of the Chancellors peace offer before the offensive we must demand from them a reckoning for all the blood and money needlessly sacrificed. We are no longer bound to our earlier conditions.&quot;Briey and Longwy.The progress of the idea of Western annexations among the Majority Parties in the Reichstag is illustrated by the suggestion which so Liberal a newspaper as the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung &quot; put forward on the 27th March, that the demand of t,he Pan-Germans, and especially the great ironmasters, for Briey and Longwy, might perhaps be settled by &quot;some exchange&quot; or &quot;some agreement might he come to whereby Germany takes ore from Briey and in return gives France the much-needed coal.&quot;The &quot; Vossische Zeitung&quot; (Radical and Jingo) has taken up the question of Briey and Longwy and has sent round a questionnaire to some of the leading German industrialists. An editorial note (7th April) begins by saying that all Germany is hoping that the V/estern victories have brought peace nearer, so that it seems timely to devote some attention to the problems of the Western peace. It goes on to suggest that &quot; England is the arch enemy,&quot; not France. If France would only become sensible, detach herself from England and approach the question of peace in a reasonable temper, &quot; there would be many ways in which German support might assist in her economic and financial recovery.&quot; On the other hand, there are &quot; the essential require-ments which our iron industry puts forward for consideration at the peace table.&quot; The questionnaire shows &quot; the stress laid on the German industrial interest in Longwy-Briey,&quot; but the suggestion is made that &quot; the manner in which these demands are to be met is a matter of policy.&quot; Xhey might be &quot; brought into harmony with political sagacity and necessities &apos;&apos;-in other words, some compromise might be arranged with France, if she only were reasonable.The iron magnates consulted by the &quot;Vossische &quot; are of course in favour of annexation, pure and simple.  They nave no faith in &quot; economic treaties.&quot;Geheimer Kommerzienrat E. von Borsig, expatiates upon the indispensability of iron and coal. Gone is the good old time of peace, when life was easier, when,the struggle for raw material not too difficult, and there was no anxiety for the future.&quot; But now our enemies have invented the idea of the economic &apos; war after the war.&apos; According to the Paris Economic Conference, this means not only a limitation set upon the market for German wares, but also a blockade of raw material. Thus would our one-time competitors, the advocates of the principle of &apos;l.ive and let live&apos; become lasting and embittered enemies. Before the war the desire to possess the iron district of Briey and Longwy lying before our doors, rarely arose among Germans, for then we could import at a moderate cost any amount of raw material out of any land. Hence, no one formerly considered Germany&apos;s future to be endangered, but now that the mask has been torn from
JOthe face of the enemy, and we get to know his true countenance, we realise what we have to expect, if we do not protect ourselves.&quot;The iron industry in all its ramifications was to economic Germany like a mighty tree, half of whose roots lie outside and in a foreign land; if: Germans wish to preserve it &quot; they have only to take so much land that in the future it is rooted wholely and entirely^ in German soil.&quot; Confronted with a problem of this sort, the English would require little time for reflection, but would stretch out their hands. Why should the Germans not do so, especially when it is a question of a portion of the old German Empire?August Thyssen points out -the indebtedness of the highly-developed iron industry to the acquisition of Lorraine in 1870. But one can only give the&apos; mines a life of 50 years, and it must not be forgotten that they lie so near to France that, at the outbreak of war, her long-distance guns could d*estroy them in half an hour. There must also be borne in mind the significance of iron for military as well as for industrial purposes, and the experiences of the blockade by land and by sea, Seriously as Germany&apos;s manufacturing trade has suffered, it would have been considerably worse had France, at the opening of the war, destroyed by gunfire the mines and foundries of Lorraine and Luxemburg. Many of the neutral countries, who have grown rich through the war are establishing their own foundries (Holland, Norway, Sweden); competition will be more severe. The &quot;already long-needed rectification, of the frontier&apos;&apos; must be taken in hand. They must put the foundries of Lorraine and Luxemburg out of the reach of French projectiles. The narrow French frontier  districts which once, for almost nine centuries, belonged to the German Empire, but were not given back at the conclusion of peace in 1.870-71-must again come into the German Empire. He expressly includes Nancy. Not only does the district belong naturally to the geologically cognate district of German Lorraine, but France would still, even without Briey and Longwy, have more iron than Germany. Far-seeing treaties would be inadequate, and their pre-war experience of the French in this regard had not been encouraging. But what would be the use of treaties supposing  which God forbid  there were another war in a few decades&apos; time?&quot; Precisely in order to secure peace we must demand the rectification of the frontier by the acquisition of Briey and Longwy. To give up Briey and Longwy, which have served us so well during the war, and to keep to our old border, is to leave unprotected the most vulnerable part of our Western front. This small rectification would permit the reconstruction of our industry and the recovery of our world-trade, for it would give us the requisite raw material for our iron and steel goods.   We should not be too sentimental.&quot;General-Direktor A. Vogler, of the German-Luxemburg Bergwerks-Hiitten A.G., remarks that it is too little known that already before 1914 a considerable part of the Briey-Longwy basin was in German hands, and that in other lands the German iron industry had been striving untiringly to acquire its own mines. Commercial-political treaties would not ensure supplies of iron from France or the overseas. Even before the war they had experienced difficulties with France, and, even if she were bound by treaty of peace to provide a specified quantity of iron, the question of guarantee would remain. There might be all sorts of evasions, shortage of labour, or of coal, questions of prices, &amp;c., which would stop the delivery.&quot; Successful strategy has given into our hands the basin of Briey and Longwy. Its loss would be but little noticed by France, the richest land in Europe as regards iron. Its possession would far centuries ensure for us and strengthen one of the most important of industries, and one upon which so many others depend. The acquisition of the iron district of Briey and Longwy *is a question of life or death for the German iron industry. In view of the situation an understanding with France on this matter must be the aim.&quot;To conclude, it was clearly demonstrated that in the first flush of the Western offensive, and at least up to the middle of April, German politicians and journals of all party shades, except the Minority Socialists, had cast prudence and even hypocrisy to the winds, and were rallying to the cry of annexations in the West. It was freely asumed that France and England would be so soundly beaten that they would be unable to offer any effective opposition to this policy, and that America had come in too late to affect the issue.   Germany would soon be in a position in
which even the great naval superiority of the Allies could not prevent her from dictating peace. This point of view is stated most frankly in an article in the &quot; Weser Zeitung&quot; (14th April), formerly a Radical (Progressive) journal of moderate opinions, but recently, it is understood, acquired by one of the great industrial syndicates. The article says that Briey and Longwy should be annexed and Flanders placed &quot;under German protection.&quot; Germany must adopt the same principles in. the West as those on which she had acted in the East. The article goes on. to ridicule the idea that England and America, provided that they still kept command of the seas, could continue the struggle after they had been defeated on land. What would France say to that theory? It was indeed impossible that England and America could hold out against an. enemy &quot; who would presently be in complete possession of the continent from Flanders to Egypt, with a free hand further East, and with increased numbers of submarines and naval bases.&quot;&quot; We must therefore abandon the policy of July 19 and exploit our military victories. Let us follow the advice of Eudendorff, and bear in mind that deeds are better than words.&quot;It will be useful to remember all these quite recent boasts and schemes if, in consequence of increasing difficulties and embarrassments both on the West and in the East, the Germans should presently initiate a new &quot;peace offensive.&quot;P.S. Nothing has been said in this report of the renewed declarations of the German Colonial Secretary, Dr. Solf, on the subject of a great German African Empire, which is to be self-sufficing for purposes of defence and is, moreover, to establish a &quot;military balance&quot; in Africa. That belongs to a whole chapter of extra-European schemes. Reference may be made, however, to- the inconsistency with which Germany protests against proposals among the Allies on the lines of the Resolutions of the Paris Conference, while herself making exclusive treaty arrange-ments for trade, e.g., with the Ukraine and with Roumania. The first-mentioned country has been constrained to undertake the delivery of 1,000,000 tons of cereals at pre-arranged prices, amounting to 20,000,000/. The Ukraine is per contra to place orders in Germany for agricultural implements, tools, and chemicals, &amp;c, to the amount of 37,500,000/. Under these arrangements, if they could be carried out, the Governments of the Central Powers and of the Ukraine would practically be controlling the whole import and export trade of Ukrainia.In the case of Roumania, the peace treaty secures for Germany a monopoly of the Roumanian oil-fields. A German company is to be founded to lease the oil-wells. The Roumanian Government is to participate in the enterprise, but German control will be secured by an arrangement of the share capital. It is expected that more than half of the demand for petroleum will then be supplied, making the German market independent of America.
