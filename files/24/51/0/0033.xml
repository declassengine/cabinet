(This DocMrwent js the Property of^His Britannic IV) aJesty&apos;sCove r n me nt.)klflflSTift OJ? HEALTH.Observations by the President of the Local Govern---^^^&quot;^ p0nt Board on tho Draft Bill and * memorandum (G.T. 4uOS ) circulated by the Minister for ^construction.I have always expressed myself in favour of a Ministry of Health to effect unification of health activities at the centre.     if therefore I criticise this Bill it is with a view of eliminating from it tho previsions which are likely to provoke acute controversy and so impede its Parliamentary passage.The introduction of Clause 4, which provides for v the eotohllshment of a Consultative Council to be attached &apos; to the Ministry of Health, raises ,a constitutional issue of far-reaching importance affecting the independence of Kinistors and their rooponoibility to Parliament.     This body which is to give advice and assistance to the Minister touching&quot;.bio powers and duties/ is to consist of &quot;persons of both sexes having practical experience of local goverriraont, of public health.? of national health insurance, of housing problems,, of hospital work, of general and special medical practice, of research and&quot; of pharmacy&quot;. The clause has been inserted as &quot;an inclispenoable con-dition of tho agreement of the British Medical Association and the Health insurance organizations to the Bill&quot;.     It is a question whether the agreement of these bodies may not be too dearly purchased.     Pothing is said in the Bill about the powers of this body, which is to be a  Statutory Body.     The powers aro left to be conferred upon it by Order in Council.     But to appreciate its importance and its relationship to the Minister for Health we must look to the scheme which has been put forward by the Council of the British Medical. Association and to the Dill circu-latecl last year emanating from certain - Insurance organiza-tions.     The scheme of the British Medical Association sets up this Consultative Council as a Statutory Body.   * Its representatives are to be nominated by the general Medical Council and tho British Medical Association. They are to hold office for a number of years.     All, or certain members of them, are to. be paid for expenses incurred or services rendered.     They are to meet not loos than once a month.     They are to have the right not only of advising the Miniate^ but, in addition, of reporting to Parliament, so that when they differ from the Minister, Parliament will have &quot;tho advantage of having a reasoned statement on both sides before it .     The Council &quot;is to be made as independent as possible of tho Minister and his officials&quot;;, in fact the Minister may go but the Council will remain.    Moreover, the administrative functions of the Ministry are to bo carried out by v, staff containing members representing the preventative and clinical side of medicine.Tho  ill of the Insurance Organizations provided for tho constitution of a Board of Health under the Chair-&apos;  manchip of)Minister, comprising representatives of various bodies (including National Insurance) connected with questions of Health.
______ ^     &quot;HfheFoHTah Tab&quot;&quot;hlPdBuBTT^tpreooTngfor the Consultative Council both tho British Medical Association and tho Insurance organizations have in view riot an Advisory Commit too in the hitherto accepted sense of the term but an active propagandist body claiming a definite share in administration and intended to keep tho Ministor up to tho mark which they appoint for him,The clause in fact puts the Minister in shackles.    T&apos;e have seen a good deal recently of press agitations.    One can readily foresee the forces which would bo brought to boar on a Minister who was not pro-pared to accept tho &quot;advice&quot; of his Consultative Council on any question of policy or. which ho did not soe eye to oye with them,     even when the policy had boon approved by the Cabinet, his would be the responsibility and he would bo the victim, theirs would be the irreeponsi-bility and they would be free to criticise and attack, I cannot understand any Government willingly placing any hintator in such a position.If an Advisory Committee is necessary for tho galvanisation of tho Minister of Health, is it not equally necessary for tho home Office, tho Board of Trade, and other Departments?    The debate in the House of Commons on 19 th Larch gave Mr. Balfour an opportunity for dealing with a proposal fo,r a somewhat similar appendage to tho Foreign Office.     his arguments are in principle applicable in this case.     I do not think tho experience of the.Insurance Commission or of the - Board of Education with respect to the Advisory Committees sot up under the Board of Education Act, 1899, and tho national Insurance Act, 1911, is so encouraging an to warrant us attaching this Council to the Minister of health.     I feel sure that generations of Ministers of Health will rue the provision.In my view there is no need for the&apos; clause at all.    A minister can always consult whom he will and every -Minister takes frequent opportunities of gauging outside and instructed opinion on all sorts of matters both by the appointment of Committees and by informal methods of consultation and conference.    Similarly outside organizations can always make representations to Ministers and they show no disinclination tf do so . ft, certainly seems to be tactically unwise for a Government to introduce a Bill for the establishment ^f a new Ministry containing a clause, which is not in tho least essential to it.     If the Clause is in the Bill the Government are committed to it.     If it bo omitted and on amendment is proposed for its insertion, it can then be seen whether it can be successfully resisted or in what form it should be conceded.Paragraph o of Dr. Adclioon!s Minute deals with tho question of the reform of Poor- Law Administration referred tc. in paragraph 1 of the First -Schedule to tho Bill.:   I quite agree with him in thinking&apos;that, in view of the issue of tho fioport of Sir Donald Maclean&apos;s Committee (which recommends that the present functions of Poor Law Authorities should bo transferred to the County and County Borough Mouucilo) it is impossible to avoid some reference to this mattor in connection with
a Bill which so intimately concerns the Local Government Boards and I feel.it will bo necessary to wake a pro-nouncement of Government policy on tho subject, though I Realize that the V.&apos;ar Cabinot have had little opportunity &apos; of making themselves conversant with the Committee^ proposals.     That pronouncement might I think take the form of a guarded approval of the goneral lines of reform which the Committee have recommended.     it is hov/ovor quite evident that when legislation on the subject comes to be attempted c, very considerable opposition from1Boards of Guardians and their supporters will have to bo faced,, and it therefore seems to mo that it will be wiser to let the matter bo debated - as it must be - on SoCQtid. Reading when the suggested pro-noun cement could be aade, and te omit from the Kill any direct reference to it.    Paragraph 1.. of the First Schedule is in no sense a necessary pert of tho Bill. It is merely a declaratory provision, and all that it enunciates can be done under Clause 2 (3).     If the paragraph remains, it is cortain to give rise to pro-longed debate in Committee and on Hepcrt in both Houses.     I am strcngly of opinion that for the sake of the Bill it is dooirable to omit the paragraph./fh.With regard to the title of/Bill, it is difficult to fight about a name.     But I hope that if a concession -is made on this point it will not be taken , as implying that the Government agree to the new Ministry being shorn of functions, not directly connoctod with Health., which are at present performed by the Local Government Board.-iuite apart from the practical difficulties of drawing the line between functions which are and are not incidental to Health administration, it seems to me to be most desirable that there should be one Central Department which is pre-eminently responsible for Local Government, and to which the Local Authorities can look for control and assistance in the dischargo of their miscellaneous duties.     It has been of great national value that the Local Government Board has been able to direct the activities of the various Local Authorities In the performance of the new duties which the war has cast upon them.Secondly, I believe it would be a grave error and a most retrograde stop to divorce Health administration from the administration of other forms of Public Assistance.    Public Assistance as a whole and in its widest sense is in just as great need of co-ordination as that part of it which forms Health Administration.-Thirdly, I- am convinced that, while the Ministry of Health may now be somewhat prominently in tho limelight, once a Linistry of Health is established, it will, if divested of othor*Local Government functions, rapidly fall into the position of&quot; a second-rate public office,     To what other Department, moreover, are the discarded functions to appertain?Apart from the First Schedule the Bill does not deal in terms with questions of Local machinery,
but although I know it to be the view of the Minister of Reconstruction that discussion on these questions can be avoided, I feel bound to warn my colleagues that in my opinion they will certainly bo raised, and here again I desire to bring to their notice the proposals of the British Medical Association. The Association "are definitely of opinion that the advantage" of unification at the Centre "would not be great unlose a corresponding unification of local authorities were carried into effect". This change is in their view "an integral part of the scheme for a Ministry of Health" and they hold that "to delay dealing with the local part of the problem will not 1essen but increase the difficulties of the new Ministry".

I fear these questions may seriously endanger the prospects of the Bill and I regret that it has not been found possible before introducing the Bill to come to some conclusion on policy and on questions of local administrative machinery. Failing that,it seems to me that the Bill should be strictly confined to the Minimum necessary for securing unity of central administration by the fusion of existing Departments.
