C R E T *j. 4565.158WAR      OAS III E T.B^gSWAJIOg Off TKS B-iO^ai ACT, .1918.    . PREPARATION OF HEW [REGISTER,Komorandum by the Secretary for Scotland*I adhere to the statement which I made to the- Far Cabinet that tho Register in Scotland can be completed by let October, and that the assessors there do not desire that date jjeo       to be altered,/    The fact that the ,:.&apos;ar Office has not yet issued the registration post cards to soldiers at home and inet   abroad, though material and regrettable, does not affect the 1        accuracy of my statement.   It is true that, if these cards are ate     not timeously returned, the completeness of the Register may bo affected; but I see no reason why that disadvantage should bo incurred.I understand that, if the cards referred to are issued now, the T;ar Office anticipate that they will reach tho registration officers in a month or at most six weeks.   I strongly urge that, if possible, the distribution and return oi these cards should be expedited.    If that were done the estimated period might be shortened.   But if that cannot be done, then by re-arranging the dates which are at present fixed for the stages of procedure which intervene between 15th toe and October 1st, there should bo no difficulty in having a complete and accurate Register by October 1st,I offer no view regarding the Register in England.   Tho conditions there are doubtless different.   I am concerned with Scotland only.   The position there is as I have stated it,(Signed), ROHCRT LHJ1JR0.Scottish Office.
