&quot; 151((PHIS DOCUMENT - IS MS PROPERTY Off HIS BMJAHBIO MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT) SEOHJJ iWAR m OABBIET,M* 4559.pTER-ALLy COUNCIL AND IMR-ALLY EXECUTIVES, Report by Mr. Chamberlain.It    By Minute 10 of War Cabinet 394 I was given authority to arrange a Conference between the Departments concerned in the worlc of the different Inter-Ally Councils and Executives.    On May 8th I circulated my Report of the Conclusions reached by the Conference (G,T,4467).       I have sinoo been in communication with all the -Departments and authorities concerned. &apos;   As a Result I have made some slight alterations of detail, and I believe that the proposals which I have now to make will be found generally acceptable.2,    In the papers left with mo by Lord Milner I found pro-nosals for a new organisation of Food Supply.    Lord Milner had not come to any definite decision on these schemes, and I am not prepared to recommend them for adoption.      They are strongly opposed by Lord Rhondda, and I am not satisfied that they are necessary.3*    I recommend(a) that the decision of the Allied Maritime Transport Council in favour of the creation of Programme Committees for all commodities be approved5(b) that the establishment of these Programme Committees should follow as far as possible the lines of existing organisations;t*)   that where the existing organisation already&apos;possess-os executive authority (as, for example, the caso of the Oil Conference) those executive powers be retain-ed.    In other oases the Committees would have no executive Authority.    Their duty would be to examine the stocks, resources and needs of each of the Allies, and to report what in their opinion was a just repartition of the available supplies between them. In all oases the functions of the Committees would be confined to the period of the war;(d)   wherever the commodity dealt with 3s onederived wholly or largely from the Dominions or Colonies, the Colonial Office should if possible be represented on the Committee,    In any case where that is not possible the British delegates should be instructed to keep in close touch with the Colonial Office, without whose services the hearty co-operation of the Dominions and Colonial Govern-ments cannot be obtained.4*    Following the lines already laid down,(a)    The !%r Office should make arrangements for em Allied Programme Committee or Committees to con-4 sider all requirements for Wool, Leather, Jute and i?laxj
(b)   the Board of Trade for Cotton, Tobacco, Matches, Timber and Paper, as well as Rubber and miscellan4 eomj  items not cdverod by any other Council;&apos;(o)   the Ministry of Shipping and Coal Controller for Coal;(d) the Petroleum Conference for llineral Oils;(e) the Ministry of Food for Ooroale, Meats and  ata, and Oil Seeds;(f) the Ministry of Munitions for Metals and Ores, including  Tin;(g) the existing Hitrogon Executive should continue to deal with Nitrates;(hi  the Sugar Commission for Sugar.5f.    In the case of Food - Cereals. Meats and F/ats, Oil Seeds and Sugar    there would be great advantage from the point of view of the most economical use of tonnage in forming a single Committee to embrace all these articles, and I believe that this ought to be done.    But the proposal raises contentious questions upon which I am not yet in a position to malje any recommendation.6* !Ehe seat of the Committees should be in London, except in so far as the special arrangements now being negotiated by the Ministry of Munitions in relation to the commodities for which they are primarily responsible provide for meeting in Paris.7ft    The Reports of these Programme Committees would form the natural basis for the work of the Inter-Ally Councils of Maritime Transport on the one hand and War Purchases and Finance on the other.    In order that the British delegates on these two bodies may be kept in touch, I recommend that Lord Buokmaster be invited to attend the Maritime Transport Council, as the constitution of the Council prevents his being formally appointed an additional delegate.    I have ascertained that Lord Buekmastor would be willing to serve if the times of meeting can, be so arranged as not to interfere with the dis-oharge of his duties on the Committee of the Privy Council.(initialled)    A. 0.2 Whitehall Gardens, S*W*, 16th May, 1918.
