This will be organised as a separate command of the British Royal Air Force under major-General Sir &apos;H,ji, Trenchard, who will work directly under -the Air Ministry.It is highly desirable that t-aj,General Trenchard should be able to deal direct on this subject with the necessary French Military Authorities,     It is therefore requested that the French Government may be informed of the arrangement and it is hoped that they will see their way to issue such orders as will enable the necessary facilities to be placed at the disposal of the Royal Air Force,, so as to ensure the carrying out of this bombing in the largest possible v.-ay .In view of the fact that these long distance bombing operations will, in the near future, partake more of an international character, it is proposed that the broad lines of action should be laid down by the Supreme V/ar Council on the advice of the military Representatives at Versailles.I am to add that the Air Council feel sure they can count upon the French Government to help them in this very necessary and. important work to the utmost.I am,&apos;Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd.)
