G.T.-4548.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending the 15th May, 1918.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The question of Industrial Reconstruction in Germany is discussed. .IPart II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press on military affairs, on peace negotiations, on foreign affairs, on home affairs, on Ireland, on the liquor traffic, and on food is described, and some criticisms of the Government are given.Part III: District Reports.The situation continues tranquil, but in South Wales a strike has occurred in the Tradegar Valley.   The agitation as to John McLean is dormant.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. Besides a somewhat important strike in the Tredegar Valley, there has been a stoppage among the shipyard workers at Garston, and a &quot;serious strike at Messrs. A. V. lioe and Co., Manchester. In the latter case work has been resumed.(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work. No serious dispute is in progress.I.-General Remarks.Industrial Reconstruction in Germany.It has hitherto been a somewhat difficult matter to obtain information with regard to German plans for reconstruction after the war. Arrangements for reorganisation of industry were in the hands of an &quot; Imperial Commission for the Transitional Period.&quot; Its activities were shrouded in silence, and complaints were made in the German press that the public heard little of this body. As far as information has been published, it appears that statistics concerning the supply of raw material in Germany were collected and preliminary estimates with regard to the requirements of the various industries were worked out, and that special consideration was given to the problem of freightage.Recently an Imperial Economic Department has been created as a branch of the Ministry of the Interior, and to this Department the Commission for the Transitional Period has been affiliated. The functions of the Department are exceedingly wide, and include some which in this country fall to the sphere of the Board of Trade, and others which are performed by the Ministry of Labour. Of the former kind are control of the Technical Committee for Shipping, of the Department of Weights and Measures, of the Canal Department, of the Imperial Committee for reconstruction of the Mercantile Marine, of banking and stock exchange matters, and of commercial policy generally. Its functions, analogous to those here iperformed by the Ministry of Labour, are relief[1100-29] BPrinted for the War Cabinet,   May 1917.
oand welfare of the working classes, statistical matter dealing with the Labour market, the Insurance Department for workpeople, and the Statistical Department. The Department has constituted a Committee consisting&apos; of no less than .370 members to consider problems which will arise in connection with individual industries. Of the members on this Committee seven only represent organised Labour, tbe rest being of the employer class, and of the seven one is known, to be a reactionary representative of a &quot;yellow&quot; union. It is thus patent that the claims of the working classes to participate in the work of reconstruction have not made much impression on the Prussian mind, and the welcome which has been accorded to the new Department by organised Labour has been tempered by criticism that its constitution does not provide a fair representation of Labour interests.It is evident that during the transitional period the Economic Department will maintain that control over industry which has been even more marked in Germany than it has in Great Britain. This will be specially obvious in the allocation of raw materials for manufacture. For separate branches of trade the formation of economy boards has been planned under the Department which are to be composed of representatives of the branches concerned. To these boards, acting in co-operation with the State, will be delegated the settlement of questions in which each is specially interested, and in particular the allocation and distribution of materials, and the division of tbe supplies released by the military authorities, of which the value is stated to run into millions.The Bill for the Beform of the Constitution of the Prussian Diet hasf provided for vocational representation of industry in the Upper House, in which it was proposed that seventy-two such representatives of industry should sit. The Constitution Com-mittee of the Diet has reduced this number to forty-eight. To this reduction a strong protest has been made by the German Industrial Council, which represents German industry as a whole, on the ground that the vital interests of commerce and industry are at stake, and that they require protection the more urgently as the political influence of tbe productive classes is weakened by the democratisation of the Parliaments in the Empire, as well as in the separate States.Last month a Bill was introduced into the Keichstag providing for the formation of Chambers of Labour. The full text of the Bill has not yet been received, and indeed in the official &quot; Beichsanzeiger &quot; only a long abstract has been published. The Bill is of the first importance, and is so framed as to constitute official councils of much the same type as the National Industrial Councils contemplated by tbe Whitley Report, the difference being that whereas those are voluntary and their constitution varied, the German Chambers are compulsory and of a sealed pattern. The functions of these Cham bers are to safeguard the industrial and economic interests which are common to both employers and employed, as well as the separate interests on the one hand of the employers, and on the other of their workmen. In particular the Chambers are charged with the following duties: (1) To promote healthy relations between employers and employed ; (2) to constitute an authoritative representation of the industry in relation to the State, to lend co-operation and to furnish written reports in the case of investigations into industrial and economic conditions of the industry; (3) to initiate measures having for their object the improvement of the status and welfare of the workmen, specially for the training of the rising generation; (4) to co-operate in the conclusion of collective labour agreements ; (5) at the request of the State and the municipal authorities, in those cases where no Trade Board exists under the Anti-sweating La v, to ascertain the scale of actual earnings amongst out-workers, to report on its adequacy, and to make suggestions as to rates agreed upon as fair ; (6) to encourage the establishment of employment registries not carried on for profit; (7) to co-operate in procuring employment for war invalids and others deprived of employment by the war.The Bill at the same time repeals section 153 of the Industrial Code, which prevented picketing, forcible suasion to join unions, and the enforcement of a penalty, provided for by a trade union in its rules, against any member who withdraws therefrom.Though the Bill has been welcomed by the working classes as an important expression of principle, several of its clauses have met with the most severe opposition. In the first place, the Bill provides for separate Chambers for salaried employees, and in this expresses the policy of the German Government, which has always insisted on the distinction between the salariat and the wage-earner, and has encouraged the general opinion as to the superior respectability of the former class. Again, it cuts at the root of organisation by locality, which is favoured by tbe German trade unionists, and
uinsists on organisation by industry, which in their view is an inferior method. Further, no provision appears to have been made for separate committees of the workmen, a principle on which the social-democratic unions lay much stress. Finally, the Bill fails to establish those Conciliation Boards and Workers&apos; Committees for which provision has been made for the first time under the National Service Law, and which the workmen hoped would be rendered permanent by statute. A minor objection taken is the constitution of the railways of the Empire and of the Federal Htates as a unit for the purposes of Chambers of Labour. During the war a large number of workmen&apos;s committees have been formed on the Prussian railways, from which are elected twenty-one district committees. A Central Workers&apos; Committee is now being formed consisting of twenty-five members, one each from all other districts and four from the Berlin district. This committee is to be constituted as the workmens side of the Chamber of Labour for Railways, and much opposition is expressed on the ground that the State Railways are in fact one single undertaking, and that a Chamber for snch an under-taking can never develop the effectiveness which, is desired.The reconstruction period has been anticipated by the employing class by very widespread measures of federation and amalgamation in all branches of industry and commerce, and an Industrial Council, covering nine-tenths of the whole of German industry and representative solely of the employers, has been constituted with the approval of the Imperial Government. Its claims for the future are large, and there can be no question that the employing class as a whole anticipates a time of grave struggle with the working classes after the close of the war. The tendencies to syndication and federation among the employers is viewed by Labour with, the greatest alarm.Labour&apos;s demands, on the other hand, have been formulated in detail in July of last year and in January of this, in a tone which leaves no doubt that the working classes are prepared for industrial war, and are determined to abate no jot of the advantages which they have gained during the last three years. It is fair to conclude that the position in Germany at the close of the war will be highly critical for industry, apart altogether from the question of supply of raw materials, or the ordinary conditions of commerce. The employers, with the sympathy of the governing class, have determined to resist the claims of Labour to an improvement in the standard of life and to any participation in the functions of management. Labour on the other hand is suspicious, and is determined to improve the standard of life, and at the same time to obtain a share in the regulation of its conditions. Similar problems are likely to arise in Great Britain, but the experiences of the war, especiall)- the provision of the Whitley Report, have accustomed both Labour and the employing class to the idea of joint interests and joint action, and it is legitimate to conclude that the chances of serious dislocation are more acute in Germany than they are in Great Britain.II. Pkess Comments.Military Affairs.On the situation at the front Labour papers offer no remarks. After noting the boastfulness of the Turkish communique on the withdrawal from Es Salt, the &quot;New Statesman &quot; suggests that a franker account from the British point of view would be an advantage.Peace Negotiations,Pacifism and regrets for abandoned opportunities are the themes of many writers. There is general belief in the mission of M. Colyn and a disposition to accept the current accounts of the terms he communicated. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; describes the offer as an endeavour by the civil authorities in Germany to defeat their militarist colleagues. The &quot; Herald,&quot; after enumerating in detail the chances of peace which have been allowed to slip away, including this latest, with its summary rejection through Lord Robert Cecil, asks whether Labour can support Governments that act like this. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; denounces the manner in which a message on the subject was issued to the press through the Central News Agency, and says it is having the worst effect on people&apos;s minds. &quot; Solidarity&quot; describes Glasgow as more than ever a fertile field for revolutionary Labour activity. Although slackness and reaction are inadmissible in vitw of the situation at the front,
tthere is no enthusiasm over Alsace-Lorraine or the Czecho-Slavs. The &quot;New States-man&quot; offers the only contrast in tone, in a well-reasoned article justifying the rejection of offers made hitherto and the secrecy observed in dealing with them.. A cynical peace is available at any time, but to accept it would be not merely ignoble but suicidal.Criticism -of the Government.General Maurice&apos;s letter was freely used for attacks on Government which develop in other directions and, as a rule, evade analysis of the debate on Mr. Asquith&apos;s motion. The &quot;Herald&quot; demands, as the first preliminary to a clean peace, the removal of the present Government and its replacement by one which will repudiate secret treaties. &quot;Justice&quot; considers the procedure has enhanced the reputation of neither Ministers nor Parliament. It savours of trickery, not statesmanship. Both &quot;Justice&quot; and the &quot;New A^e&quot; at the same time admit that thev have no alternative Government to suggest.!Foreign Affairs.Secret treaties are again being much discussed. The &quot; Herald &quot; devotes most of its space to a reprint of the texts already published in the &quot; Manchester Guardian,&quot; and compares these with declarations by Ministers from time to time. Annexationists in all countries are responsible for prolonging the war. The &quot; Clarion&quot; reproduces articles by &quot; Homo &quot; (S. Grumbach) in &quot; Humanite,&quot; discussing the Lichnowsky and Miihlon papers, and arguing that these have made a greater impression on the German Socialists than is usually believed.Few comments are made on Russia, but the &quot;Herald&quot; denounces any attempt at interference in Siberia. The &quot; Call&quot; describes rumours of a counter-revolution as fabrications.The Labour correspondent in the &quot; Christian Commonwealth&quot; defends the American Labour Delegation from the attacks referred to last week, and describes it as a mission of enquiry rather than a body of plenipotentiaries. He admits that the American Federation of Labour has been opposed to the Internationale, but suggests that the effect of the Delegations report should be awaited. Mr. J. R. Macdonald in &quot; Forward&quot; criticises the Delegation for relying on Trade Unionism instead of on Labour and Socialism as he regards them.Rome Affairs.Full accounts of May Day demonstrations appear, and warm indignation is expressed at the prohibition of the meeting in Finsbury Park. It is urged by the &quot; Herald &quot; that a similar meeting, last year was peaceful. Prohibition was an insult to organised Labour, which was responsible for the intention to meet. If papers are suppressed and freedom of speech abolished, the Labour movement will be driven underground with serious consequences. A letter to the same effect by the Chairman of the National Council for Civil Liberties is printed in the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot; The &quot; Call,&quot; referring to large peaceful meetings abroad and at home, asks what London workmen propose to do.Ireland.There is no change in the tone of comments, but the subject is not very prominent. The &quot; New Age&quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; complain of delay in the production of a Home Rule Bill. The &quot;Call,&quot; in a leading article, says that Government has thrown the Irish into the Sinn Fein party. Labour must now rally to help the Irish nation. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; disclaims any intention of advising the Irish on their own affairs. They regard themselves as an independent neutral nation, which can become involved in the war only by its own decision. The appointments of Lord French and Mr. Shortt meet with no approval.Liquor Traffic.The scheme for state purchase is condemned by the &quot; New Age.&quot; In the alternative it suggests division of compensation equally between the trade and labour employed by it.   The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; regrets that purchase was not carried out three years ago
on the Samuel report, when millions might have been saved. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; thinks that opinion generally is coming round to the views of the Labour party on this matter, and sums up the demand as one for State purchase and local veto, with national ownership and local management.Food.Comments are few and mainly favourable. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; thinks women should share in the extra rations. &quot;Justice&quot; praises the Food Consumers&apos; Council for watching the quality of food. In&apos;regard to past policy it criticises the delay in fixing maximum prices for food and in limiting freights. The tax on sugar will strengthen the hands of Labour in the conscription of riches. Keference is again made to the bad effect on children&apos;s health of potatoes in bread. The &quot;Co-operative News&quot; has changed its tone towards rationing and registration. Instead of blaming the Ministry of Food it calls on members of co-operative societies to register with their own shops now that a national system of compulsory rationing is in sight.III. District Eeports.London and South-astern.The situation in this district is very quiet, and few reports of unrest have been received. A public meeting of workers in Woolwich Arsenal expressed their confidence in the Prime Minister.Some discontent prevails among members of the Electrical Trades Union, and at a meeting of shop stewards on the 6th a strike was threatened over the pay of charge-men and the suspension of certain members. A further meeting on the 13th May passed resolutions about confining men to their special grade, and a request for travelling allowances for men from London.The London Aircraft Woodworkers&apos; Council, a rank and file movement, has recently become active and is now exhorting the workers in this industry to unite on the ground that the fourteen existing trade unions do not maintain their interests.The London Trades Council has offered an emphatic protest against the proposed increase in railway season tickets, and suggests that this is not the right method to check extravagance in travelling.West Midlands.Eeports from this area indicate continued calm. At a large meeting of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Soldiers and Sailors at Birmingham on the 5th it was resolved that all fit and single men should be called up before any discharged man was asked to volunteer.   About 3,000 discharged soldiers took part.The Birmingham Trades Council, which is well known for its pacifist sympathies,, passed a resolution recently that the continuance of the war &quot; increased the fierceness of the struggle and brought famine nearer,&quot; while it appealed to the House of Commons to accelerate a Peace Conference.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Some unrest is still prevalent in this area.The demand for increased wages among workers in the clothing trade round Leeds has caused considerable excitement among all members of the Garment Workers&apos; Union. Latest reports indicate that matters are now more satisfactory. A number of disputes in the wool trade have been referred to the Chief Industrial Commissioner.The Labourers&apos; Union in Suffolk is at present showing some activity, and a considerable number of young men have recently joined it.North-Western.The situation in this district has not deteriorated. The working of the Man-Power Act is being closely watched. The Mersey Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades held a meeting at Liverpool on the 7th to consider complaints. A vigilance committee was appointed to interview the Shipyard Labour authorities and state complaints.[1100-29] C
At the Tyldesley Collieries the complaint is made that men under 25 who have come to the mines since 1914 are still employed, while older men are being called up. Meetings of miners from other parts of the same district also have been held to consider this question. In Barrow it is alleged that preferential treatment is being given to the young men in some firms, and efforts made to protect them from military service, and this is naturally giving rise to discontent.The shortage of beer at Barrow is causing discontent, and it is suggested that a card system might be established to give priority to men engaged on furnaces, smelting, and other similar work. The steelworkers, on the other hand, have proposed distribution through a canteen, in order to obviate the difficulty of the present shortage. On the 12th May the men invaded one public-house and threatened to help themselves unless they were served at once.Conscription in Ireland is being debated at Barrow, where the shop stewards are initiating a course of propaganda on this subject.The recent award to the transport workers is still under consideration at Liverpool, and a series of meetings have been held on this question. As a result of a visit by Mrs. P. Snowden, the Women&apos;s Peace Crusade has been revived here. Open-air meetings are being held by the I.L.P.Northern.The situation in this area is very quiet.Some of the younger men liable to service would be glad of any opportunity to create trouble, but little sympathy is expressed for their views, and public opinion is largely expressed in favour of the comb-out., At a May Day demonstration at High Shields on the 5th the views expressed were very moderate in tone, and the meeting passed off quietly.South Wales.The situation in this area is on the whole fairly satisfactory, with the exception of a strike in the Tredegar Valley, which is dealt with elsewhere.Discontent as regards the 12$ per cent, bonus is rife among the Cardiff and district railway shopmen, and at a meeting held on the 8th a resolution in favour of a strike was adopted unanimously unless this award was conceded from October last.Scotland.The excitement in this district reported last week has subsided, and matters are moderately quiet.The conviction of John McLean has not yet affected the purely industrial situation. No protest meetings have been reported, but the Clyde Defence Propaganda Committee are considering action to secure his release.A May Day demonstration, which was held on the 12th May at Paisley, was noticeable as being the first of its kind to be held in this place. The proceedings were orderly and the attendance considerable. The speeches were on the whole moderate, though they included some harsh criticism of Government; a resolution was ultimately passed in favour of the overthrow of the Capitalist system and the establishment of a Co-operative Commonwealth. Though references were made to the arrest of McLean, it was evident that little interest was felt by the audience in general.IV. Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The general situation is not unsatisfactory, and few strikes or disputes of any importance are reported.The Shipyard Labour Department has six new strikes to report, while thirteen previous cases still remain unsettled.   Work has been resumed in fourteen cases.Of the new strikes the chief is at Messrs. H. and C. Grayson, Garston, where the whole of the shipyard workers ceased work owing to the refusal of a timekeeper to join the union. About 1,200 men are affected by this dispute, and the matter has now been referred to the Controller-General of Merchant Shipbuilding.   Riveters in two yards at
Whiteinch (Scotland) came out, but the strikes have been temporarily settled. Messrs. Workman, Clark, and Co., Belfast, are again involved in a strike, as 100 ship-wrights ceased work on the 11th, owing to a demarcation dispute with the joiners. A meeting held to effect a settlement had no result. This case has also been referred to the Controller-General of Merchant Shipbuilding.The Ministry of Munitions makes reference to six strikes this week, and notes that on the 11th May only one strike on munition work was in progress. The number of workpeople involved in strikes for the week ending the 8th May was 7,469. Of these by far the most important was that at Messrs. A. V. Roe and Co., Manchester, where about 3,000 men and women struck, owing to the discharge of a clerk who belonged to the union. Victimisation was alleged by the workers, while the firm complained of inefficiency. There was some fear that the dispute might be used to induce sympathetic strikes elsewhere, and so afford a means of resisting military service. The men have, however, returned to work upon the promise of the Ministry to proceed against the firm.Other strikes which may be mentioned are one of 750 employees of the Cardiff&apos; Corporation, who struck because the Corporation have refused a further advance of 4s., and strikes at Sheffield and at Blyth in connection with the 12j per cent, bonus.On the 10th May about 1,000 men at Messrs. Austin&apos;s factory, near Birmingham, struck, on the grounds of the dismissal of a man for insolence and a dispute about bonus.   Prosecution of the strikers is contemplated.The War Office Contracts Department have no new cases of stoppage of work to report.Ten new cases are reported by the Coal Controller, which have rendered approxi-mately 17,270 men idle.   Work has been resumed in five of these cases..The whole of the Tredegar Company&apos;s pits are at present idle as the result of a wages dispute at one of the collieries. The stoppage is apparently a breach of the agreement whereby all disputes are to be referred to the Conciliation Board before a stoppage takes place. The dispute was to be considered by the newly appointed &quot; Emergency Committee&quot; of this Board on the 14th, but no intelligence of a settlement has been as vet received.At the Bentley Colliery, Doncaster, a stoppage occurred on account of the employ-ment of &quot; post-war miners.&quot; A short stoppage also occurred at the Harrington Colliery of the Workington Iron and Steel Company in contravention of the Conciliation Board Agreement, but work was resumed on the 14th.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Shipyard Labour Department reports 38 new controversial cases and 78 old. Settlements have been effected in 35 cases out of this total.None of these cases is of serious importance. The most noticeable are a dispute at Messrs. Fairfield S. and E. Company, Glasgow, where the painters refused to work overtime in consequence of a dispute regarding overtime rates, and where a strike is now threatened; and one at Messrs. J. Bro vn and Co., where the drillers allege that the. firm is not paying rates in accordance with the price list which was recently fixed.The Electrical Trades Union at Belfast is also reported as restless owing to the action of the military authorities in refusing to allow a workman to enter the Belfast docks where he was employed.The Ministry of Munitions notes nine controversial cases. Of these three are concerned with the 12^ per cent, bonus, while two have been occasioned by dilution. Of the latter one was caused by an objection to the introduction of women at Messrs. Dewars works, Glasgow, and has been settled by the allowance of overtime and by the society undertaking to supply the firm with more men; in the other case, at Messrs. J. G. Carrick and Co., the union have repudiated the agreement upon this subject and have refused to assent to any dilution by male labour; thirty-four tinsmiths have in consequence left the firm.The employes of theBelsize Motor Company are showing discontent at the dilatory methods employed to settle their dispute, and a strike is threatened in consequence.The War Office Contracts Department report only two new controversial cases : the Hosiery Federation in the Nottingham and Leicester districts have applied for an increase to bring the present bonus up to 8d. in the Is. The matter is to be referred to arbitration. The second case is an application to the Master Curriers&apos; Associations in Scotland for an increase of id. per hour. A strike is threatened unless this demand is conceded.
The Goal Controller has no new controversial cases to report.The Committee on Production have heard forty cases in London during the week.These included claims from the National Union of Clerks and by the building trade in various districts. An application was also made by the North of Ireland textile traders for the payment of the 12^ per cent, and the 7\ per cent, bonus. It is noticeable that this is the first application for these advances in ^he textile trades.New differences reported to the Chief Industrial Commissioner during the week number 153, of which. 41 are claims for the 12^ per cent, bonus. The total differences noted during April was 750, a number which showed a distinct reduction upon that reported for March.A meeting of the parties to the Liverpool building trade dispute has been arranged for the 15th May, when the Governments position will be explained.D.
