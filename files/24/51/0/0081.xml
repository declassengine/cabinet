Their Majesties the King and Q,ueen have recently visited anumber of Elementary and Secondary Schools in London and have , .graciously conveyed to me Their appreciation of the manner in which*the educational service of the Country is being maintained.   Their ^ Majesties&apos; letter, a copy of which is attached, has been sent to all Local Education and School Authorities throughout England and Wales and has called forth the warmest expressions of gratitude from them and from the teachers.2, I have issued a number of Circulars during the past monthdealing with various matters, among which may be mentioned the following:-(a) The increase of Grants in respect of the attendance of students at Elementary and Secondary Training Colleges, at Elementary Training Departments of the Universities, and at Training Schools of Domestic Subjects, and the granting of allowances to Teachers attending Vacation Courses in Physical Training.(b) Calling for a Return of the Annual Salaries of teachers in Public Elementary Schools in the area of each Local Education Authority.(0) Announcing the issue of revised Regulations under whichthe Supplementary Grant for Elementary Education, sanctioned by Parliament last year, will be payable during the current financial year.3, At the suggestion of the Ministry of National Service I haverequested Local Education Authorities to do what they can to facilitate the medical examination of recruits by consenting to place the Elementary Schools at the disposal of the Recruiting Authorities in cases where thty are   unable to secure othersuitable accommodation. This may invelve some dislocation of school work, but it is hoped that arrangements will be made to reduce the inconvenience to a minimum.
With a view to securing the utmost economy in the use of ooal I have, at the requcot of the Board of Trade, called for ft Return from all Local Education Authorities as to the extent by which they estimate that the consumption of coal in Schools and other Education-al Institutions during 1917-18 can be reduced in the coming winter. The information to be obtained will, it is hoped, assist the Coal Mines Department in arranging for a sufficient and equitable distribution of the available supplies.I have been in close consultation with Sir Auckland Geddes on the subject of the administration of the new Military Service Act as it affects teachers and educational officials and I have communicated the decisions that have been reached to all Local Education Authorities and to the Governing Bodies of Secondary Schools and other institutions of Higher Education.Subject to special exceptions to be made by the Ministry of National Service on recommendation by the Board of Education and with** out prejudice to the right of appeal on personal grounds, it has been agreed(a) As regards men liable to Military Service prior to the passing of the Military Service (No.2) Act, 1918, all teachers and officials up to the age of 43 (other than those in Categories C2, B3, C3) are to be medically examined and graded by National Service Medical Boards.    Those in Grade I, and all those in Grade II. who had not attained the age of32 on the 1st January, 1918, are to be released for service forthwith.(b) Teachers and officials now for the first time liablefor Military Service will be called up for medical examination and grading as and when other men in their age groups are called up,     Those placed in Grade I. will be released for military service subject to the exceptions referred to above.. Those placed in Grades II, or III. will be retained for the present and will be entitled to the same protection as the &apos;younger men.
A dispute In regard to salaries hae arisen between the teachers and Local Education Authority of Carmarthenshire, as the result of which all tho Assistant Teachers in the Elementary 8chools throughout a considerable part of the County hare ceased work.    I have arranged to bring the two parties to the dispute together under an independent Chairman and I hope that a satis-factory settlement will be reached.The department hae been engaged! in consultation with the Treasury in preparing a Bill dealing with Pensions for teachers in Public Elementary, Secondary, and other Grant-aided Schoole.The Education Bill has been under discussion in Committee In the House of Commons and some progress has been made,    X am in frequent communication with the various Interests which will be affected by the provisions of the Bill.17th May, 1918.
/ WINDSOR CASTLE, 220y 6th April, tqi8.Dear Mr. Fisher,It has given the King and Queen much pleasure lo visit recently gthools of various types, and thus gain an insight into the daily life of :he rising generation at work and at play.Their Majesties are aware of the magnificent response which the Educational Service throughout the Country has made to the demands of the present time, not only in its contribution to the Fighting Forces, but also in the assistance which it has rendered in many kinds of important War Work.Above all, they wish to express their admiration of the self-denial and devotion&apos;of the Teachers, who it is evident, while training the mind and body of their pupils, recognise the importance of the formation of character.These visits have brought home to tho King and Queen the keenness and patriotism of the Youth of the Country.They realise the unselfish and hearty manner in which boys and girls, inspired by the example of their Teachers, have formed War Savings Associations; subscribed money for charitable purposes ; and, by their handiwork, contributed to the personal needs and comforts of the Troops.Their Majesties feel that the Nation can be proud of its young sons and daughters, whose example during this great War augurs well for the future of our race.I am commanded to request you to convey to the School Authorities and Teachers the hearty congratulations of the King and Queen upon the admirable manner in which the Public Service of Education is being maintained, the progress of which their Majesties will ever watch with interest and sympathy.Believe me,Yours very truly,(Signed)    STAMFORDHAM.The Rt.
