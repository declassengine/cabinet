SECBET,HORSE   RACING. Report.Jby--tne-President of the Board -of &quot;Trade.**^t &amp;^- In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet, arrived at on the 1st May (-War Cabinet 402, (12),) I have consulted with the President of the Board of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries and representatives of the War Office and Food Controller on the subject of the advisability of the con.-tinuanco of horse racing.The President of the Board of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries is of opinion that a certain a:;iount of flat racing 3hould continue, as it is in the national interest that the breeding of thorough-bred horses should be assisted.The Army Council are vitally interested in the main-tenance in the United Kingdom of a sufficient supply of horses suitable for military purposes to meet both the annual replacement in peace time and the far greater demand in case of mobilisation, and they favour the continuance of flat racing to a limited extent.     A memorandum showing the views of the Army Council is attached, as is also a memorandum handed in on behalf of the Food Controller.After discussion it was decided to recommend      the War Cabinet that, in view of the necessity for restricting railway travelling, no flat racing should be allowed except at Newmarket after the 1st June, and that race meetings under the rules of the National Hunt Committee should not be allowed during the ensuing winter season, the greater part of the competitors at such meetings being geldings.It was also decided that no extra trains should be run to Newmarket for the conveyance of race goeis or tickets scld to Newmarket beyond the capacity of the ordinary trains.A.H, STANLEY.Board of Trade,
Memorandum setting out the reasons v/hy the Army Council considers that the present limited Flat Racing Programme should not he interfered with.The Army- Council is not directly responsible for horsebreeding, but they are vitally interested in the main-tenance in the United Kingdom of a sufficient supply of horses suitable for military purposes, to meet both the annual replacement in peace time, end the far larger demand on mobilisation.90$ of Army horses ere of riding and light draught type;   in the former thoroughbred blood predominates, while in the production of th9 latter it plays an important part.The maintenance of the Thoroughbred Breeding Industry is, therefore, vital to the efficiency for war of His Majesty&apos;s Land Forces.Racing is essential to the Thoroughbred Breeding Industry in that it provides the only test of the real value of thoroughbred stock and thereby shows which are the best stallions to use for breeding purposes.    Without this test the selection of stallions could only be made on looks and breeding without any reference to the really essential points of courage and stamina.The training of horses for the test of the raceoourse is expensive;   even a temporary cessation of racing must result in horses being thrown out of training and the majority of the colts, which are to develop into the Sires of the future both of thoroughbred and half-bred stock, would be castrated, for they cannot be turned away to grass as can geldings and fillies.Lord Curzon speaking in the House of Lords on May 24th, 1917, said:&quot;That we possess in this wonderful stock - upon which foreign countries are always indenting, and which was really the foundation of the well-bred horse of the world - a national asset of almost incalculable value is undoubted.&quot;The Council cannot but feel that in the face of the development of light motor traction, the maintenance of a stook o  horses suitable for the mobilisation of the Army in future years will present increasing difficulties, and that as numbers decrease it is essential that the average standard of excellence be improved;   they therefore urge with the utmost seriousness that the very foundation of all excellence in horsebreeding, i,e. the Thoroughbred Ereeding Industry, should not be interfered with as long as it is possible to maintain it.The Council has no desire to urge the resumption of racing under the National Hunt Rules, which they understand is largely confined to geldings and mares, nor do they ask for more raoing under Jockey Club Rules than is sufficient to keep the industry of thoroughbred breeding alive.
MSM0H.^&apos;DU1 BY MIITISCT CP POOD.The quantity of cereals concerned in the main-tenancs of racing is not serious as affecting the general supply of the country, and the Food Controller thinks that this side of the question should not affect a decision as to a continuance or otherwise cf racing;   hut in his opinion the continuance of racing during war -time has a ba  moral effect and is distinctly creating a good deal of irritation among all classes other than thoss immediately interested in herse racing.    He will not press his objection if the Cabinet think that the proposals for a limited number of flat racing&apos; fixtures are wsll founded.
