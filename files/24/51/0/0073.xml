-thl8 dqcmraftnt to fur property Qfjrt relating to the War Work of the Board of AgricultureCAB&apos;Scotland for the week ending 15th May 1918.hum??/I.   FOOD PRODIKTION........-&apos;&quot;&apos;The ohange to milder weather which was noted in last week*s report has oontinued:   plentiful rains have fallen aooompanied &quot;by a higher temperature and all orops are respond-:ing to the ohanged conditions.1.   Improvement of Hill Pastures..    In connection with the efforts of tlie Board io promote the breeding and rearing of cattle on farms principally devoted to sheep, several meetings have been held in the south-eastern distriotB of Scotland. These have been attended by representatives of the Board and a considerable interest in the scheme is being manifested.2.   Compulsory Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2M.During the week the Board have issued the following ordersFarm or Lands CountyAbemethy Grass Parks PerthshireL&amp;weide LanarkWest Lochridge AyrGrass Park at Towerdean Midlothian.Section	(1)	(a)(1)	(a)(1)	(e)(1)	(a)3.  Wart Disease of Potatoes.    Potato planting for the season is now praoiioally completed, and steps are being taken to aecer-:tain whether all the occupiers of gardens, farms, oto. infected with Wart Disease have complied with the provisions of the Order in regard to the planting of varieties immune from attack by the disease.   A list of all scheduled holdings in respect of which planting licenoes have not been issued has been  pre-:pared and each holding will be visitod either by the Police, the Inspectors of Local Authorities or the Board&apos;s Inspectors. These steps are being taken with a view to facilitating control of the disease later in the season.   A large number of occupiers of infected premises have not applied for a planting licence and while it may be that in many oases no potatoes have been planted in the Infected ground there is a strong probability that in others the provisions of the Order have been ignored.   The question of the steps to be taken in these latter cases will be considered on reoeipt of reports from the inspecting officers.,       4.   Manufacture of Potato Flour.    The Ministry of Food in connection with the disposal of the 1918 Potato Crop are making arrangements for the manufacture of Potato Flour.   It is propose,! in the first place to supply a number of Potato Flaking Machines to private individuals in the chief potato growing districts who have premises in which these machines could be installed and worked.   Preference is to be given to districts where the potatoes could be conveyed to the factory by road or inland water-way as It is desirable in the present congested state of the railways to use wherever possible these alternative means of transit.    A oiroular giving details of the process of potato flaking and pajrticulars of the conditions under which the necessary machinery Hill/
will be supplied has been issued by the Ministry of Pood.   Copies ere being sent by the Board to the District Agricultural Executive Committees in those potato growing districts in Scotland where there are likely to be surplus supplies.   The Committees circularis-:ed to date are those in Perthshire, Porfarshire, Pifeshire, Stirlingshire, Kinross-shire and Easter Boss.5*   Tractor Ploughing,   Returns for the month ending 20th April of the work done by the Board&apos;s tractors have now been examined in the Department.   During this period 2000 acres were ploughed, 771 acres were cultivated, 566 acres were grubbed, 2982 acres were harrowed and 100 acres detailed as &quot;other operations&quot; were oomplet-:ed.   Owing to the favourable weather conditions prevailing in April the demand for tractor implements was not so great as had been expected.   Towards the end of April, however, there was an increased demand for tractors to undertake cultivating and grubbing work with the result that in many districts the Board1s tractors have been fully employed.    To meet these requests seventy grubbers of a type mueh heavier than those formerly employed have been issued to District Agricultural Committees and thirty cultivate :ors specially adapted for use with tractors have also been provided. The Board intended to provide Disc Harrows for districts where large areas of old pasture had been broken up,but owing to the unavoidable shipping difficulties these only came to hand at the end of April and could not be made use of to any extent during the present season.    Orders have been plaoed with agents for Binders to be used for harvest work and delivery of these has already begun.6*   Horses for Agricultural Work.    The Board have been indebted to the Keoouni&apos; department&apos; for horses during the busy spring months. In all 78 horses were provided for the use of Committees by the Army Authorities and much valuable assistance was thereby rendered. The majority of these animals have now been returned to their units and it is hoped that all will be returned by the end of this month.7.   Corn Produotion Act 1917. Part II.Wages of AgirlcCTTural Workers. In terms of Sections 12and 18 ox the 2nd Schedule oTIFeTot, the Board have issued Regula-:tions requiring the discharge of certain duties by District Agricultural Wages Committees and the Central Agricultural Wages Committee.    These Regulations empower Distriot Wages Committees to define (1) the benefits which may be reckoned as payment of wages, (2) the value of such benefits, (3) the employment to be treated as overtime employment.    The Central Wages Committee are /required to define the general principles on which benefits may be reckoned as payment of wages in lieu of payment in oash and to them is reserved the power of taking proceedings in cases where workmen are paid at a rate less than the minimum.COLLECTION OP STATISTICS AND RETURNS RELATING TO AGRICULTURE,m1mMMwmmm***mmmmm mm mm wmm mm i^iiwmoiwwwiai mmm ^n*i**iwThe Board propose to obtain from all occupiers of agricultural holdings in Scotland (except in the crofting districts) who have this year planted one acre or more of potatoes, a return showing the/
tho acreage of each variety planted.   The Board of Customs and Excise have undertaken that their officers shall distribute and collect supplementary schedules for this purpose along with the schedules for the Annual Agricultural Returns, which are as usual -to be filled up on 4th June.(2)   The Ministry of Pood (Live Stock Section) propose to obtain on 2nd June a Census of Live Stock and Mlk Production,     It was suggested that this might to some extent be combined with the Board&apos;s Annual Returns, but after consideration it has been decided that the purposes of the two Departments will best be served by independent action.TRAINING Off SOLDIERS AND SAILORS IN AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY.Employment of Convalescent Officers.    The Beard have approached&apos; tie War &quot;IJil3&apos;.ce&apos;&apos;wiTira prcpcsal for the employment on agricultural and forestry work of officors undergoing treatment for neurasthenia and the effects of shell shock in view of the need for labour in such industries at the present timo and of the probability that such employment would bo conducive to the recovery of officers so engaged.   The Board are able to provide facilities for the utilisation of their services in clearing and burning felled areas and also for placing the men on farms or -estates.   The Army Council are agreeable to the Board&apos;s proposal and arrangements are at present being completed with a view to putting the scheme into operation without delay.2.   Training of Discharged Service men as Working Foresters. This sbneme was explained in ike Board1 s report of 27th December last.   It may now be stated that the Board have received offers from Estate proprietors to train 100 discharged men.   The number of applications received is 36, of which 19 have been approved amd the men placed for training.   In addition to issuing leaflets and circulars explaining the scheme the Board have sent a representative to visit the larger War Hospitals in Glasgow, Bangour and Aberdeen. This official has also met representatives of the majority of the War Pensions Committees.It may be added that although a larger number of applications is desirable the number so far secured is not unsatisfactory in view of the high wages at present being paid in other industries.3,   Training of Discharged men in Gardening.   Reference is made to the Board&apos;s fteport of 30th January last.   Offers have been received from Nurserymen and Market gardeners to train over 300 men and the Pensions Committees are at present plaoing suitable applicants for training.4.   Training of Discharged men in Horticulture, Bee and Pig-Hapln^.The East of Scotland College of Agriculture have with the Board1s approval framed a scheme for the training of men at the Veterans* Garden Oity Association Farm, Longniddry, East Lothian. Under this scheme it will be possible to train 12 men at a time and the course will last 6 monthB.   Arrangements are at present being adjusted with the Ministry of Pensions./
