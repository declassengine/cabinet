(This Document is the Property of His Britannic lvlajesty&apos;s Government.)SUPPLIES   OF   RAW   MATERIALS   PROM   SPAIN.Circulated by the Minister pf Lhinitiojis.1.     On 30th January 1910, a memorandum (Reference G-*Te 3501) was circulated to the War Cabinet by tho Ministry o,f Munitions asking that the policy of the Shipping Centrollor with regard to outward traffic to Spain should be brought under review,    A copy of this memorandum is attached.memorandum are:-(a) owing to tho refusal of the Shipping Controller to allow British or controlled neutral vessels to proceed to Spanish ports the outward freights to the so ports have, been forced up to over 400/- per ton.(b) tho result of theso exorbitant freights (pro-war rates were 4/6&amp;, to 5/6d9) is that the supplies of Iron Cr Lead, Ccpper and Pyrites from Spain aro endangered, and the largest producer af Copper and Pyrites - the Rio Tinto Company&quot; threatens to closo its mine.2.     Cn 15th February 1918, tho Ministry of Shipping circulatod a memorandum in reply - copy of which is also attached - giving in detail tho reasons why its policy was considered to be justified and urging that rather than that this policy should bo altered:- Britishinterests in Spain whose products aro essential to the conduct of the war may be onabled to charter Spanish ships for their requirements under such financial guarantees as the circumstances of each cose justify&quot;.The two main points dealt with in the
3.     On 20 th February tho question was referred by the War Cabinot tp Lord Milnor, who did not deal with the main question of policy, but decided, as an interim measure, that excess freight over 100/- should bo paid by H.M.G. on 5,000 tons of coal for the Rio Tinto Company, and that the Foroign Office and Treasury should jointly recover from the French and United States Governments their share of the extra cost.     These instructions have been carried out, deliveries of Pyritos have been obtained from the Rio Tinto Company and negotiations with France and the United States have been begun.     It is understood, however, from information supplied Vy the Foreign Office and Treasury that it is unlikely that either country will agree to contribute any part of tho excess cost incurred.4,     In January, when this question was first roferrod to the War Cabinet, its bearing on the supply of Pyrites was the most important&apos; aspect from the point of view of the Ministry of Munitions.     The position has now altered, as the Allies will soon be largely or even entiroly independent of Rio Tinto, owing to the reduction in the manufacture of explosives in France and this country, the purchase of a large quantity of Pyrites from Norway and the fact reported by Lord Reading and Sir Charles Gordon in their cables of 23rd March, 1918, that the United States hope, in the course of tho year, to make themselves practically independent of supplies of Pyrites from Spain.     The question, therefore, now largely resolves itself into one of oxtra cost to the Ministry of Munitions, although supplies of Iron Ore, Copper and Lead may bo affected to some extent.
5,    As far as can Too estimated the nett additional cost of supplies from Spain due to a difference botwoon an outward freight to Huelva of 100/- and 400/- is as follows:-(A) Lead -   freight on 1-g- tons of coal (orecruivalont coke) por tw of load- say 35,000 tons xIf x 300/-    -    707,500(3) ^yritos    -   freight on 1 ton of coal to, 25tons of Pyrites delivered -600.000 x 300/- -    360,000(0) Iron Oro   -   (say)  200,000Total    -       1.347.500It is not possible to make any accurate estimateof the extra cost incurred in connection with tho 3^ to4 million tons of Iron Ore which will be imported fromSpain during the next twelve months.     The extra oostaveraged ovor tho whole Spanish export to this country .of Iron Ore is probably about l/- per ton of Ore at presentrates of freight compared with the freights prevailing upto October last.     On an expert of four million tons thetotal extra oost payable either directly as a subsidy or..indirectly in tho price of tho Oro may, therefore, beassumed to be In tho neighbourhood of tho figurementioned.    No direct additional chargo falls on Copperowing to these high freights, but if the Rio Tinto Minois shut down an important source of Ooppor will be closedto the Allies.5.,    It is understood that the effect of theeo enormous freights on tho Spanish Exchange is viewed by the Treasury with considerable apprehension.     The freight on a ship carrying, say, 5,000 tons&apos;to Huolva amounts to  100,000 or more,/
more, and whether the freight is oxpressod by tho Charter-party to bo payable in pesetas or sterling tho ultimate effect on the exchange situation is the same, as tho money in the latter&apos;case is remittod&apos; to Spain by tho shipowners,7.     On 17th April, a conference between representatives of tho Foreign Office, Treasury, Ministry of Shipping and&apos; Ministry of Munitions was hold in Lord Robert Cecil ls room with a view to sosing whether it was not possible to reconcile the views of the various Departments as to the Shipping Controllerfs policy, but tho conference proved abortive,    A letter dated 24th April has since been received from tho Shipping Controller, confirming that &quot;having regard to the still existing desperate shortage of tonnage he can see no reason for making any change in his policy&quot;,0*     In his memorandum of 15th February, the Shipping Controller defended his -policy on the ground that ships whose services would otherwise be loot to tho Allied cause were thereby enticed into the Spanish trade and that a. substantial fall in the then existing rates&quot; of freight might shortly be expected.     The particulars of the Spanish ships actually engaged in the transport of coal to concerns in Spain in whose activities the Allies are interested are not available to the Ministry of Munitions, but the additional number of ships attracted to tho Span:ohttrade during tho last fow months is believed to bo arm 11, while up to now thoro appears to bo no indication whatever of any fall in froights, tho only movements so far having boon/
boon in an upward direction.0.     In the circumstances it is submitted for the cortsidoration of the War Cabinet that the policy of the Shipping Controller with regard to the export of coal frsm the United Kingdom to Spain should bo again &quot;brought under roview with a viow to its being decided whether(a) the policy should be abandoned and the embargo on tho chartoring of controller neutral ships to Spanish ports removed, or whether(b) the policy should be approved and either(1) matters bo allowed to continue as at present, or(2) that instructions should be issued to theShipping Controller that the fuel required by undertakings In Spain whose output of lead and pyrites is vital to the Allies should be transported in British or controlled neutral buttons.     The quantity of coal involved is approximately 75,000 tons per annum.In the opinion of the advisors of tho Ministry ofkunitions it is not possible to ration the Iron Ore mineswith coal and, if tho last alternative is adopted, thesemines should bo left to make their own arrangements as at7rreoent.
