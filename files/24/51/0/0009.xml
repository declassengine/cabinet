/zLIFE OF PARLIAMENT AND PREPARATION OP NEW RBGISTBJB.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Local Government Board.Septennial Aot wao still in force, met on the 31st January 1911.     The Parliament Aot, 1911, reduced the seven year&apos;j* to five years, but &quot;by the Parliament and Registration Act 1916, the Parliament and Local Elections Acts, 1916 and 1917, and the Parliament and Looal Elections (No. 2) Act, 1917, this period has from time to time &quot;been extended, Under the last mentioned Act the life of the present Parliament cannot continue beyond the 31st July next, unless further provision is made, and it is desirable that an early decision on this matter should be reached.last with the approval of the War Cabinet, the end of the qualifying period for the purpose of the First Register to be prepared under the Bepresentation of the People Act, 1913, was fixed for the loth April next, and the date for the coming into force of the new Register was fixed for the 1st October next.     It was at that time considered that at least six or seven months would be required for the preparation of the Register and that if this time were allowed there was good reason to anticipate that the Register would be ready by the 1st October,The difficulties, however, in the way of carrying out the worfc have proved even greater than was anticipated. They arise mainly from the heavy burden of work placed upon Clerks to County Councils and Town Clerks of Parliamentary Boroughs (who are the Registration Officers under the Act)The present Parliament, elected when theBy an Order in Council issued on the 4th March
and their staffs by Vae additional and onerous duties, many of thorn of a novel character, now devolving upon thorn in conneo-tion with the War.   The diffioulty is more especially felt in London and the great towns.   For various reasons the task of preparing the first Register under the Act would in any case have necessitated practically a house-to-house inquiry throughout the Country and consequently some increase in the staff employed for registration purposes.   At the present time the staffs are not only depleted, and likely to become more so in consequence of the recent Military Service Act, but it is almost impossible in certain areas to obtain the services of canvassers competent to perform the work.   These considerations point to the desirability of an extension of the time allowed under the Order in Council for the preparation of the Register, but there is another and most important consideration,   The Representation of the People Act requires the Admiralty, Army Council and Air Oounoil to furnish Registration Officers with information as to the names and addresses of naval and military voters.   It was decided in consultation with these Departments that the most effective way, oo far as the Western Front is concerned, in which up-to-date information could be furnished, would be by means of printed postcards in a prescribed form supplied to men serving in the Forces on the Western Front and returnable by them direct to Registration Officers.   Such postcardswith the necessary instructions, have been prepared and printed, but tho War Office&quot; have found it impossible in view of the present military situation to take any action with a vie?? to the distribution of these postcards.   It is hoped that a very large percentage of naval and rr.ilitary voters will be placed upon the Register from the information obtainable locally by the Registration Offioers and other persons engaged in the preparation of the lists, but it is extremely desirable that further time should be allowed
so as i;o-pejraii3j^ return ofthe postcards.The desirability of an alteration of the datea at present fixed for the preparation and oowing into force of the Register was urged from both sides of the House in the Debate on the Vote for the Local Government Board last week.   There can be no doubt that if the present dates are adhered to, the netf Register will be very imperfect, and that, if it ie desired to obtain as good a Register as is reasonably practicable, the date of ooaiing into force of the Register should be postponed from 1st October to^lsi- December or preferably the 1st January.   Not only is more time required for the preparation of the lists but it is anticipated that more time will be necessary for the revision ffork.It is accordingly suggested that the life of Parliament should be extended for a further six months, i.e. , to the 31st January next and that a new Order in Council should be issued postponing the Registration dates so as to permit ofithe First Register coming into force on the 1st January.Although it is not necessary that any announcement should be made at present as regards the extension of the life of Parliament it is most important in order to avoid duplication of work that a decision should be reached forthwith as to the postponement of the dates for registration.The Bill for prolonging the life of Parliament should also postpone the next ordinary Municipal Elect ions which take place in November.W.
