MEMORANDUM TO THE WAR CABINET BY THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT OF THE JAPANESE MISSION.

With reference to war Cabinet Minute 404, Minute 13, in which the War Cabinet finally decided on reconsideration that it was inadvisable that a civil mission should accompany the Military Mission to Japan, I would point out that the objections raised by Mr. Balfour were to the specific character of the civil mission to be sent, i.e,, that the questions more properly belonging to the Foreign Officer might be raised by its presence, and what it would be a mistake to send a sailor, Lord Beresford, with a military mission. Considering this controversy as now decided by the War Cabinet, I would ask its permission to send out to Japan a mission for propaganda pure and simple. This mission would not be open to Mr. Balfour&apos;s criticisms and would in no way traverse ground within the sphere of the Foreign Office, which should therefore not be able to object to its beinp sent, unless this Ministrv is to be considered act adjumet of the Foreign Office.

Advices continue to reach me that the state of public opinion in Japan towards the Allied cause is far from healthy, and that the Japanese people to not realise the exertions, or the ?rength and successes of the British, nation. Nor, I believe, is this fact denied by any competent authority.

I feel, therefore, that it is a matter of imperative necessity to send such a mission to Japan, and I would ask the authority of the War Cabinet to organise it.

BEAVERBROOK.
