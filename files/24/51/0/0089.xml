0.1/162/485,SITUATION AT MURMSK.On tho 14th May a report was received by theAdmiralty from the RearWUmiiral, MURMANSK, conveying a recommendation by Lieut... Colonel Thornhill for the despatch of a composite Brigade, (enclosure A).At the same time news was received by the Admiralty that their detachment at PECHENGA had been heavily engaged.    They therefore decided to despatch reinforce-ments In the shape ef 300 - 400 marines, who will sail in tho next few days.2,     On the 16th Hay General Poolc asked that a force of 250 infantry with machine guns and 100 Royal Engineers should be dospatchod with a view to forming, with the above mentioned marines, a mobile striking force to be used at PECHENGA, MRMANSK, ARCHANGEL or IW as required. *3?.     On the 17th the Rear-Admiral MURMANSK telegraphed * (enclosures B.&amp;.C.)    that the situation was becoming critical and that a decision must be given as to whether or not the Allies intended to maintain their position in -the Murman Province.     If it. was decided to do so, the Brigade previously asked for should be despatched at once..4&apos;.    The above raises the whole question of our future policy in Russia,    If the enemy establishes a submarine base at PECHBNGA or in the KOLA inlet he will entirely cut us off from Russia, except through Siberia, thereby obtaining undisputed control of all the resources of EuropeanRussia,
Russia, and effectively preventing us from talcing anypaoH^ in its re-organisation.     Unless we can- re-establish a front in Russia it is not clear how we can ever obtain a decision in our favour, and the seizure of the northern Ports is a necessary preliminary.     We are already commit-ted to a certain extent and it- must, be recognised that the despatch of a small expedition will inevitably entail further demands,, which the existing state of our man-power may not enable us to meet;,     For this reason it is strongly recommended that the Americans should be asked to - participate&apos; in the expedition, with a view to their eventually assuming its chief burden.5,        The small force required in paragraph 2 can be pro-vidod without seriously affecting the supply of reinforce-ments to France, - preferably by drawing on the Special Bri-gade, and t recommend that this be done but only on the un-derstanding that it will he followed by a composite American Brigade to be obtained from troops going to France,,The diversion of the small number involved will not affect the situation in the West in the immediate future since in any case they require further training before they can be put into the line in France,(sd.)

SECRET.ENCLOSURE   &quot;A.&quot;   TO   0,3/162/465.The following Information has been received from tto Rear-Admlral, MJRMANSK :*1 Lieutonant-Colonol Ttoornhill arrived here evening 11th May and Ms acquainted himself with the situation as far as it can be ascertained on the spot.   He directs mo to state he concurs with me that a Brigade which should include four field companies of engineers sbould be sent at once to Pecbenga together with a sufficient -artillery.    I suggest latter should consist of Naval hand guns as more suitable for the country .    Any force sent should have a.t any rate certain amount of tent and field equipment.    On arrival Pecbonga proportion of force would be landed for service there and remainder brought round to Murmansk for service along the railway line. Reliable information as to movements Finns is exceedingly difficult to get owing to nature of country in irhich they are operating and for this reason force named is a wise and necessary precaution which should not be delayed for a day.   In any case political effect would probably bo most marked as it would be first direct step taken by v Allies to raise the national spirit.1Naval Staff,INTELLIGENCE DIVISION 14.   5.   18.

Without this my. hands anot the hancts&quot;&quot;&quot;o&quot;f  hF&apos;locar*au&apos;EEorj/Hes^are hopelessly tied and we can only drift on into disaster,iThere are two courses,     The firstJ.s to despatch at 13th May) flnoe the Brigade asked for in my 330*T   1?hie snouldTe supplemented! by a bribe To^tlae^iropulaTi&apos;on ihTKe^shape of definite promise of food supplies in the immediate future and the promise of despatch ?th Hay) of fishing equipment in accordance with my 348*;    Approximate date as to first lot reinforcements must be given.    The second course is to intimate circumstances require complete withdrawal of allied intervention in Murman affairs.     This would include withdrawal of H,H.S. &quot;COCHRANE&quot; to MURMANSK^ withdrawal of all detachments landed except those required to guard refugees, complete stoppage all supplies including coal, &amp;c, and the ultimate withdrawal of allied men of war as soon as embarkation of all refugees had been completed.     It should also include a threat of armed reprisals on the spot in the event of outrage to allied life or property.    I do not consider there is any middle course.personally, looking at the matter from my restricted purview I consider the first course is the best,I shall carry out your instructions in the spirit and as far as possible in the letter but beg that the measures to &quot;be taken to carry them out may as far.as possible be left to me,The above relates only to Murman province, and has nothing to donwith Archangel.Request speedy reply, if 0730.1st Lord 1st S,L.

COPY   0?   mBOBAK.From R.A. Murmansk To       AdmiraltyDate 17.5.18. SentReed.   1.40 p.m.P 111Cypher  H392.    Your 265 was received after despatch of my 337 I endeavoured 14th Kay to verify statements made in my 387/ re Chicherin Commissicmer for Foreign Affairs.     ^as unable to do this fully but consider it certain that telegrams have been received from Chicherin tending to weaken position of L:urman Sovdep in connection with Allied position in Llurmansk and giving handle for agitation against Sovdep ana -Allies. It must be remembered that all political correspondence between local authorities and Loseow is carried on en clair and that any telegram received is known to the various political factions.    With reference to your 265 consider any assurance coming from this quarter should be taken with greatest reserve and point out that there is no co-operation with local Bolsheviks aa such but only with recognised elected representatives of Russian Nation.    However these things ma  be it remains a fact that position here is threatening as reported in my 387.     I repeat with emphasis that it is necessary that it is neoessary that 1 should be at once informed on the points asked for in my 387. Provided **ecpl** of Hurman Province will receive definite assurance allies will protect them from outside aggression and from political persecution she would be forced to break with Central Govt. there can be little doubt allied inter-vention will be welcomed in a friendly and not in hostile spirit.     In addition assurance roust be given them that Allies &apos;viii not leave them to starve and will assist them in their industries.    But definite assurances of this nature *an no longer be delayed if the Allied position here is to be maintained&quot; and if grave results are to be averted.0715.1st L 1st SL DCNSD 1st SLDBOD (H) for action DN1 2Hd of U 2............
