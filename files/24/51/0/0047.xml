 THIS P0CPUB1IT 13 TO; FROIWJY OF HIS BRITANNIC MtTOflTV&apos;8 ggSBBHSL8.B 0 R g i, G..Tr4547.129WAR     CABINET.PROPOSED EXTENSION OP THE MUNITIONS OF WAR ACTS .TQ CROWN ESTAELISKiffiHTS.Memorandum by the Conciliation and Arbitration Board for Government&apos;&apos; femnioyees.(Previous Papers - G.T.1449; G.T.2666, CT.2691, and G.T.J2797).WarCabinet 288, Minute 17.A1.    On the 30th November, 1917; the War Cabinet &quot;authorised the Ministry of Labour and tho Ministry of Munitions to insert in the next Munitions of War (Amendment) Bill a olauee to the effect that the Munitions of War Acts should be binding on the Crown&quot;,    This will have the effect of giving to Crown employees engaged on munitions work (whether as workmen or as clerks or otherwise) a statutory right to refer differences as to rates of wages etc., to the Ministry of Labour for settlement in accordance with the provisions of the first Schedule to the Act of 1915 - that is to say, ordinarily, by the Committee on Production.Zm    His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware that all these employees (provided that their salaries do not exceed  500 a year) already possess the right to refer suoh differences to the Conciliation and Arbitration Board unless they are classes of employees &quot;who are engaged wholly or mainly by way of manual labour of a kind common to Government and other employment and in respect of whoa the Board are satisfied, on the certificate of the Government Department ooncemed, that adequate means for the settlement of such questions have already been provided, or that changes of remuneration always follow the decision of the recognised machinery applicable to the district generally&quot;.3*    The extension of the Munitions of War Acts to manual workers in the employment of the Crown will presumably exclude them from the Board&apos;s purview under the exception quoted above. The Board agree that the Committee on Production will be a more appropriate tribunal for suoh classes.4.    The position of non-manual employees is different. There is no provision for any suoh classes (with salaries of less than  500 a year) being excluded from the Board1s purview. If therefore they were given a statutory right to report their differences to the Ministry of Labour (who have no power under the Acts to refer a case to the Board) they would have open to them two tribunals between which they could choose or to which they oould appeal in turn.5.    It would appear that there are three possible ways of overcoming this difficulty, vis:-(1)    By the Terms of Reference to the Board feeing amended by Eis Majesty&apos;s Government so as to exolude all Governaaat taployees engaged on &quot;munitions&quot; work:(ii)   By making the Board a tribunal under the Munitions of War Acts for the purpose of dealing with clerks, etc:(ili) By excluding clerks etc., from the proposed extension of tho Munitions of War Aots to Crown employees.
6.   The Board are of opinion that the first of these alternatives may he dismissed, as it would not he feasible in practice for clerks employed by one Government Department to be dealt with by one tribunal and clerks in another Government Department, who might be on the same scales of salary by another.   They have from the first expressed the view that the exclusion of non-manual classes from the proposed extension (alternative iil) was the proper solution of the problem.   They understand, however, that the Minister of Munitions holds that he has no%authority thus to limit the scope of the War Cabinefs decision.7.   The Minister of Munitions has submitted to the Board a draft bill in which an attempt is made to give effect to alternative (iij consistently with the duties and procedure of the Board as laid down by His Majesty1a Government.   A careful consideration of the terms of this draft confirms.the Board in their view that this course presents difficulties which are almost insuperable.8.   The Board are the more impressed by these difficulties by reason of their inability precisely to appreciate the reason for bringing clerks etc, in Government employment within the provisions of the Munitions of War Acts.   The object cannot be to give them the right to refer their differences to an arbitration tribunal, for this they already possess.   The prac-tical effect of the legislation proposed will apparently be confined to providing that the crown establishment or employees concerned will be guilty of an offence under the Act (a) if they declare a strike or lock-out unless a difference has been reported to the Board and twenty-one days have elapsed without the Board dealing with the case; and (bj if they fail to comply with an Award by the Board.9.   So far as the proposal is to impose on a Crown establish-, meat, under penalty of being guilty of an offence under the Act, a statutory obligation to comply with an award and to refrain in certain circumstances from a lock-out, the Board ^would submit both that this is unnecessary as a practical measure and also that it appears to involve certain anomalies.10.   So far as the proposal is to declare that a strike of certain classes of Civil Servants will in certain circumstances be illegal, the Board would point out that this appears to implys an admission of the doctrine that other classes of Civil Servants whose duties are certainly   not of less importance to the community (as, for instance, postmen and telegraphists) possess, and may legally exercise, the right to strike, in spite of the fact that an arbitration tribunal is open to them.11.   So far as the proposal is to impose on the Board an obligation to take action within twenty-one days, the Board would offer the following observations for the consideration of His Majesty1s Government.12,   The Board have already called attention to the pecuiia position that they occupy.   In paragraph 24 of the Record of their Proceedings in 1917 they wrote :-&quot;The interdependence of the various classes of the &quot;Civil Service makes our position essentially different from that of an ordinary arbitration Board, dealing with specific submissions. While our operations are limited to the civil Service, they may range over the whole of its multifarious classes and grades.
It hes boon tho duty of tho Treasury representative in oase after case to point out that wo oould not concern oursolvss merely with tho   mse boforo us, but were obliged to considor tho results of a docislon on the claim in question upon other classes throughout the ramifications of the Civil Service. It follows that oar functions tend to become much wider than tho determination of the articular differences laid beforeIt may bo added that tho Treasury have often represented to tho Board that they ought not to issue an award on a particular case until thoy have considered other pending claims from similar classes of employees.   The Board recognise the force of the argument and are frequently obliged to follow this course.   Moreover, it is pertinent to mention that His Majesty&apos;s Government have selected for the duties of the Conciliation and Arbitration Board three gentiemon whose time is very fully occupied with other public dutlas and who would not be able to devote more than the two whola days in each week which they already give up to the work of the Board.13. In these circumstances it will be readily understood that to introduce into the work of the Board a statutory provision whioh appears to id^pose upon the tribunal the responsibility for any strike or lock-out that may take place if a cose has not been dealt with within twenty-one days would create a situation of groat difficulty.   Sven if it were practicable for the Board to approximate towards a compliance with such a provision, this could only be done by differentiating between Government employees engaged on Munitions work and other Gfovornmont employees, and so. setting up a specially privileged class at tho expense of tho main body $f Civil Servants, in whose interest the Board was created.14. i*or roasons set out above tho Board trust that His Majesty1s Government may see fit to limit the proposed oxtensicr of the Munitions of War Acts so as to confine it to, persons employed wholly or mainly by way of manual labour.&quot; This would bo the natural complement of the Terms of Referonoo given by His Majesty&apos;e Government to the Conciliation and Arbitration Board1 Sanctuary Buildings,Great Smith Street, S.V7.1.14th May, 1913.
