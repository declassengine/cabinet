[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government)      $219Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1918.SECRET.Naval weekly appreciation No. 50.NAVAL OPERATIONS. Minelaying in the Heligoland Bight has been continued. North Sea.R.A.F. machines from Dunkirk, employed on naval duty, have carried out a number Handera of patrols and reconnaissances. area&quot;On 30th April a raid was carried out on Ostend, eleven 230-lb. bombs being dropped close to the electric power-house, but owing to clouds and fog the results could not be observed.On 1st May two 230-lb. bombs were dropped on enemy trenches north-east of Nieuport, and bombs were also dropped on the coastal road west of Weenduyne.On 2nd May about 1,500 lbs. of bombs were dropped on or near Zeebrugge Mole, and twelve 230-lb. bombs on Zeebrugge lock gates. One bomb fell in the middle of the lock and several very close to it. Two enemy machines were driven down, and one of our machines is missing.On 3rd May, during bombing patrols, thirty 230-lb. bombs were dropped on Zeebrugge Mole and lock gates. One bomb fell on the seaplane base, one on the root of the Mole, two on a battery, seven in the entrance to the canal, and the remainder in close proximity to the target.Considerable activity was noticeable on the outer half of the Mole, and a number of small craft were seen round the block-ships, the positions of which had not changed. The Zeebrugge-Bruges Canal was clear of shipping, and the lock gates were closed, and two vessels, apparently dredgers, were inside the Mole.   Ostend was also, clear of shipping.On 4th May one of our W/T machines was shot down and fell into the sea after a reconnaissance over Nieuport, the pilot being severely wounded and the observer killed.The statement in last week&apos;s Appreciation that two coastal motor boats were missing after the operations at Zeebrugge was inaccurate, our casualties to ships on that occasion being one destroyer sunk by gunfire and two motor launches missing.On 1st May the minesweeper &quot; Blackmorevale &quot; v/as sunk by a mine in the North Casualties. Sea, three officers and 23 men being lost.The special service vessel &quot; Bombala,&quot; which left Gibraltar on 17th April for Sierra Leone with the tug &quot; John 0&apos; Gaunt &quot; in tow, is missing. A report has been received of a vessel having been attacked by two submarines 30 miles west of Cape Blanco on 25th April, and as the &quot; John o&apos; Gaunt &quot; was found abandoned in this position, with tow rope cut, the vessel referred to was probably the &quot; Bombala.&quot;ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week under review from 13 to 16 large enemy submarines have been Submarines located, three being vessels of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type.   Of these latter, one operating, was outward bound and two were operating in the neighbourhood of the Canaries. The remaining large boats were working mainly off the coasts of Ireland, and the Irish Sea and the eastern part of the English Channel have been the areas of chief activity.(0 1144)   Wt.     55  5/18  HtS

There were no losses in Coasting trades during the week under review, but the losses in Non-United Kingdom trades were double those of the previous week.

The Irish Sea is the area where this increase of activity is most marked, but the attacks are also more numerous in the English Channel and the Mediterranean.The number of British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing in organised convoy, Vessels and the losses sustained whilst in convoy, during last week, compared with previous periods, Convoyed, are as follows : 
The total losses of all vessels for April, 1918, are the lowest recorded since September, 1916 (when they were 165 vessels, aggregating 230,651 tons), and are only 30 per cent, of those sustained in April of last year, in which month the heaviest losses took place. It will be noticed that the British losses in April are not so low as in several recent months, the improvement in the total figure being due to the very small Neutral losses and much reduced losses of other Allies. This is doubtless accounted for by the requisitioning of Neutral tonnage and by the development of the policy of employing the tonnage remaining in Neutral hands on the safer routes.Daily The following table shows the daily average of World tonnage sunk by enemyaverage of  action and of British merchant tonnage sunk or damaged by enemy action, or tonnage     escaped from attack, for each month since unrestricted submarine warfare commenced, standardized by taking 100 as the daily average for February, 1917, in each case:-attacked.Minelaying.Casualties.Month.

As regards British tonnage it will be seen that the tendency for the daily average of vessels damaged but not sunk to increase, to which attention was drawn last month, has not been maintained.ENEMY MINES.The Week under review has been quiet from an enemy minelaying point of view, only one new cargo of mines having been located and that off Plymouth. Three further mines have been destroyed seaward of Montrose, which leaves at least 20 still unaccounted for in that area. An unusually large number of drifting mines, both British and German, have been destroyed or reported off the East Coast during the week. These have evidently drifted from the Heligoland Bight, as wreckage belonging to German vessels has also been picked up.The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks : Week Ended.

It should be borne in mind, in considering the output of new tonnage, that the number and tonnage of merchant ships which are being repaired and returned to service are, as appears from the next following table, very rapidly increasing, and these repairs make great demands on the shipbuilding and marine engineering resources of the.country.(011:44) A3

OF ENEMY SHIPS.Merchant- During the week under review 14 enemy merchant ships arrived at and 12 sailed frommen.        Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat.  No enemy ships have entered or left Rotterdam.The enemy have recently for a short time made use of the port of Harlingen, instead of Delfzyl, for their vessels engaged in the coal trade, but the scheme has now been abandoned and the Dutch have relaid the minefield which they had previously swept in order to enable the port to be used by the enemy. Only one German vessel is reported as having entered the port during the period that it was in use.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.An ultimatum has been sent to the people of Archangel to the effect that the store ships now lying off that port will be removed without unloading their cargoes unless the stores required in exchange are forthcoming. The Archangel Committee is evidently much alarmed and H.M. Consul has been confidentially informed that they propose once more to ask the Central Government for permission, to carry out the exchange, and that unless this is forthcoming they will take the law into their own hands and carry through the bargain. In the event-of reprisal on the part of the Bolshevik Central Government, they request that H.M. Government may be ready to support them to some extent. Meanwhile we are sending on the &quot; Vladimir Russanofi &quot; with a cargo of herrings to demonstrate our good intentions, and promising to offer naval assistance, so far as it can be spared, in the maintenance of order, should the local authorities be unable to deal successfully with the situation.Armed Finns are reported to be advancing on Pechenga, whither the Rear Admiral, Murmansk, in co-operation with the local authorities, has despatched H.M.S. &quot; Cochrane &quot; with a small force of Red Guards with orders to protect the town.H.M. Vice Consul at Helsingfors reports that the Germans have already forwarded to Germany the greater part of the military stores left behind by the Russians, and that the relations between the Germans and Finns of all parties are becoming increasingly strained.The garrison and Finnish Red Government have arrived at Kronstadt from Viborg, which is now believed to be in the hands of the White Guards.
The whole of the Russian Baltic Fleet is now at Kronstadt, and the sailors are showing marked hostility to the National Commissars, especially towards M. Trotsky. Resolutions against his interference in naval matters have been passed, and a &quot; pogrom &quot; of Jews is feared as a result. Orders have been given to withdraw certain of the guns from the more outlying forts to Petrograd for its defence.German troops are reported to have entered Sevastopol on the 1st May without opposition, and they are also reported to have occupied Taganrog on the northern shore of the Sea of Azov.As regards the Black Sea Fleet information was received on the 1st inst. that the Commander-in-Chief had informed Kiev and the officer commanding the German troops in the Crimea that he had hoisted the Ukrainian flag in the Fleet. In a telegram received on the 3rd inst. from the same source it was stated, however, that the two &quot; Dreadnought &quot; battleships and a number of T.B.&apos;s had proceeded on the 1st inst. from Sevastopol towards Kertch, while other units had proceeded to Novorossisk.Spain.The crew of U.C. 48, with the exception of six men who have been left to look after the submarine, have been interned inland at Alcala de Henares. The Spanish Press, however, reports that the necessary repairs to the submarine have been completed and that she is now ready for sea.INaval Staff,9th May, 1918.[Appendices.
