WAR   CABINET.53IMPORTATION Off BACON - LACK Off STORAGE &amp;o.5002250!tois country. &quot;(Copy of a letter from Port and Transit Executive Committee dated 10th May, 1918)At the general Meeting of this Committee held yesterday, I was requested to place before you the following statement in ragari to tho recent importations of bacon, and in doing so, to state that from the information before this Committee, it would appear that only the unusual coldness of the weather during the past six weeks has saved the Country from the disastrous consequences which must have resulted if large quantities of bacon had^been left to go&quot;bad on the quays at a time when the Nation was on strict meat rations.(l) On the 14th March, this Committee was informed that there was then actually at sea on its way to this Country about 47,000 tons of bacon, and that these consignments were to be followed rapidly by shipments which might represent in the whole 400,000 tons.It was further advised that a very considerable portion of these imports would consist of mild cured bacon requiring immediately on its arrival either cold storage or further curing.No warning had been given to this Com.. it tee of wus extraordinary importation; and from what has since happened it is obvious that no steps had been taken by the Ministry of Pood to organise storage or the facilities for the distribution of the bacon as it arrived in this Country.The extraordinary nature of the imports will be Rbvious when it is borne in mind that during the whole of the year 1917 the total imports of bacon were about 350,000 tons.(2) Immediately on being informed of this extraordinary bacon importation, this Committee placed itself in communication with the Ministry of Food, the Railway Executive Committee, and the Port Authorities.It pointed out to the Ministry of Pood that there ware no facilities in the Ports adequate to deal with such extraordinary importations; that it would be impossible to use the quays or the Railways for tho purpose of sorting and classifying the bacon according to the taste and fanoy of different parts of the. Country, or to use the Railways for the purpose of making retail deliveries throughout the Country.   Therefore the bacon, as it arrived, must be sent through immediately &quot;wholesale&quot; to the districts in which it would be consumed.In the result, Representatives of the Ministry of Pood on the 31st March, agreed to arrange for the bacon being sent forward through the Ports as it arrived in bulk, so that the sorting and classification and the retail distribution might be made in each District, but even yet, this method of forwardingColonel Sir Maurice Hankey, ;K.G.F. Secretary, War Cabinet.
has not boon brought into full operation,(3) This Committee further impressed on the Ministry of Food tho necessity for securing by cable the fullest possible infor-p, mation as to each shipment, so that the Ministry might be able mi make arrangements before the arrival of tho ship in this Country for the receipt end distribution of the bacon.    Vessels arc still .arriving, and bacon is still being landed on the quays before any instructions have been given by the Ministry of food in regard t(? its receipt or as to its ultimate destination.   In consequence, there are now large quantities of bacon on the quays rapidly deteriorating in condition and in the meantime blocking the Ports,So long as receiving and forwarding instructions are wanting, it is of no avail for this Committee and the Railway Executive Committee to provide labour and means for transport.(4) when it became obvious that the bacon could not be either stored or distributed as it arrived, this Committee   pressed the Ministry of i?ood to either restrict its imports or to sanction an increased consumption.   Steps have now been ta&amp;en for securing both of these objects, and it is understood that those steps should become fully effective at the end of this month.   In the meantime it is only the unusual coldness of the season that has warded off the disaster of large quantities of food becoming unfit for human consumption after it has been brought to this Country.If the warmer weather comas, there is grave reason for fearing that, during the next few weeks, large quantities of bacon will become unfit for human food,(5) This Committee, acting in close co-operation with the Ministry of Shipping and the Railway Executive Committee, has done, and will continue to do, its utmost to maintain the flow of traffic through the Ports, but it is quite beyond its power to avoid the consequences which result from such action as has been taken by the Ministry of flood in regard to the recent bacon Importations.(6)   Jhe work of this Committee has been rendered the more difficult because the Ports have been Overwhelmed with the bacon imports, for which no provision has been made by the Ministry of ?ood, at a time when, under the instruction of the War Cabinet, every possible effort is being made to give the vessels, bringing the United States troops, the quickest possible turn round in the Ports on the West Coast; whilst shipping tonnage and tho port facilities available are   being used to the full to accumulate large reserves ox food and raw material in the East Coast Ports .(7) In the circumstances, this Committee desire to place the facts before yom in the hope that steps may be taken to limit the imports brought in by any one Department, and in particular^ imports of perishable commodities, to the quantities which that Department is prepared either to pass Into immediate consumption or/bto store, as and when tho vessels bringing in such Imports, reach this Country,If the imports of perishable food be in excess of such quantity, it will be impossible for this Committee to guard against the disaster of its becoming unfit for human consumption, j even at a time when the Ration is on strict food ration.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)   NORMAN HILL..- -u-^ Chairman.
