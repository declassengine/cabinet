This -:as, however,   een somewhat delayed owing to repeated wet days.The roots will shortly be sown, as well as the acre of Dutch Brown Beans.The crop of oates in Bushy Park, and in a lesser degreee also in Richmond Park, is suffering from wire-worm.In newly turned up ground it is not unusual for the second year to be worse, in this respect, than the first year,, owing to the turf being again brought to the surface b,o the-second year&apos;s ploughing.   A considerable part of the 30 acres of oats .at Bushy Park has received a second drilling of Oats, 2 Bushels to the acre, and the whole area in both parks has received a thorough rolling with a ring roller, and a dressing of sulphate of ammonia, and salt has been given.In Richmond Park where the wire worm has appeared more in patches than in any we 11 defined area, no extra sowing has   een tried.If the oat crop shows signs of failing on some of the lighter land ;;ithin the next week or so, it is proposed to break it up and plant potatoes of which we have sufficient in stock.
