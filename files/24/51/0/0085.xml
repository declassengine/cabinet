(p Property ofannic tViajesty^ Government.)Confidential.LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES. M/Z (15th May 1918.)I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics. Section of the Ministry of Munitions,on the labour position in munitionDuring the week ending the 8th May, 1.1,511 working days-or one-fourteenth of 1 per cent, ofi the possible working time were lost through strikes on munition work, exclusive of Admiralty work. The greatest loss of time was at, the GorseMill Aircraft Factory (Hollinwood), where 2,900 builders lost. 4,350 days, and at the works of Messrs. A. V,, Roe &amp;. Co., Limited (Manchester),, where 1,532 employees, lost 3,064 days.Women1 s. Consolidated Order.--Before the war there was noj State regulation, generally speaking, of women&apos;s wages, and women, as a rule, had been too ill-organised to secure,, as men liadssecured, the protection of standard rates. Accordingly, with the influx or women workers into, munition industries,, it became necessary, both for the sake of the women themselves and in order to prevent a chaotic condition in the. whole wages situation for both sexes after the war, to fix by State action the remuneration of women war workers. As these workers diffused themselves in constantly greater numbers through the factories, penetrating into industry after industry and mastering one process after another, the wages orders issued by the Ministry of Munitions were of necessity multiplied, extended and amended, in order to deal with shifting conditions and new problems. The time, however, has arrived when it is possible to bring these numerous regulations within the ambit of a single Order ; and, after much earnest consultation with the industrial representatives of women workers and with other parties interested, a code of women&apos;s wages is about to be issued.The opportunity has been taken to make a few alterations in the rates prescribed, especially in connection with processes in the manufacture of aircraft.There will now be a general, minimum, guaranteed rate of h\d. per hour, plus 6s. per week, for women of 18 and over. This is not a standard rate. It is the lowest time-rate which in future-is-to-be paid&apos;to&apos;any women munition workers.In establishments chiefly engaged on the manufacture of aircraft, women employed on aircraft processes are to receive a minimum rate of Qd. per hour.The Order prescribes rates for women employed on sheet metal work for aircraft work work not hitherto done by women and detailed directions are given for the wages of women on several woodwork processes, to take the place of an interim Order issued in April last year.Higher Wages in relation to Output and Time-keeping - The, managers of 144 Govern-ment establishments have recently recorded their opinions on wage increases in relation to (a) output, and (b) time-keeping. On the point of output, the opinion is general that while higher wages have not stimulated effort they have not led to its relaxation. Only in 15 cases is an increase in output attributed to higher wages. Only in nine eases is it suggested that in consequence of a rise in wages output has decreased.With regard to time-keeping also, the general verdict is that wages advances have brought about little or no change.   Only a small minority of the managers took aA  (33)5791   Rk 20   125   5/18   E &amp;.Sindustries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I.-STRIKES.II.-WAGES.
contrary view, and of these the opinions of the majority are unfavourable. In 16 factories 10 of them shell factories-time-keeping has worsened with the rise in wages.   In 11 factories time-keeping has improved.III.-RECALL OF RELEASED SOLDIERS.The War Cabinet directed shortly after the first German offensive that as many as possible of the serving soldiers released from the army for munitions and shipbuilding work who were fit for general service should be returned to the colours at once. The total number of these men was about 29,000. Some were employed on : work such as blast furnaces, from which it was not possible to release them without -serious loss of output, and a large proportion Were employed on shipbuilding and marine engineering, which are dealt with by the Admiralty. From the firms controlled&apos; by :the Ministry of Munitions, 11.580 men were sent for medical examination. Of these, 3,795 were found to be category &quot; A &quot; and were retained by the army; the rest were returned to their work. The proportion found to be category &quot; A&quot; is surprisingly small, considering that most of these men had seen service as soldiers. None of the soldiers employed in Admiralty firms have yet been returned.IV. -TRAINING CENTRES AND EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES;Co-dperation between the employment exchanges of the Ministry of Labour and the training centres of the Ministry of Munitions is important in two ways in finding candidates for training in munition work, and in transferring the trained worker to the munition factory. To promote this co-operation the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of Labour have caused conferences of their officers to be held during April in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Manchester and other places. Under ,.the practical working, arrangements that have been concluded, vacancies at training.centres will be..notified to the employment exchanges, which in their turn will obtain and recommend candidates for instruction. A final selection from these--Candidates will then be made by :those responsible for their training.       ,        :
