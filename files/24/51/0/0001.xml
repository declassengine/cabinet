(This Document is he Property ofHit Britannic M t tv&apos;a government) &quot;ffyculat^tfl.....The.Klruc.and jfa Cabinet.It was decided at the Inter-Allied Confer-ence held in London on Inarch 15th to explain to President Wilson the expediency of Allied inter-vent ion in Eastern Russia.Lord Residing discussed the question at length with the President on March 19th0 &apos;The President admitted the argument that, if Germany could carry out her Eastern policy un-molested by the Allies, she could concentrate on the Western Front, but observed that the Russians themselves would object to German domination; that they would be difficult to manage and would eventually rise against Germany, and that events were tending to the consolidation of the Bolshevik elements against the Germans.   He agreed that, if Japanese intervention were undertaken, the safest * course would be that it should be undertaken with the assent or mandate of the Allies and America, but he dissented from the suggestion that an im-portant reason for this was the trust of the Russian people in America, which, he said, hung by a very slender thread, as the Bolsheviks re-garded
regarded the American administration as existing for the benefit of capitalists.   He said that he was very conscious of the perplexities of the situation and that Vie was ready to take the risks &apos; provided that he was convinced that there was a fair /prospect of a successful result of the venture, hut that his main difficulty&apos; was that he could not see how Japanese intervention, would so seriously affect Germany as to cause German troops to he withdrawn from the t/estern front.   He was not convinced that any military advantage would he gained0   The distances were great, the railways were broken up and there were rolling stock difficulties j so that he did not see how the Japanese forces available to enter Siberia could be so spread as to guard the Trans-Siberian rail- * way.   General Bliss had expressed very serious doubts on the military aspect of the question,-, The President added that at some later stage Germany might begin to overrun Siberia and that the situation would then require reconsideration. He also referred to American opinion which was un-. favourable to Japanese intervention.   When asked for his alternative suggestion, he replied that the decision must be on. the Western Front. -The

Lord Reading was further in-structed to ask the President if he would agree;-(a) to a simultaneous proposal on the part ofAmerica and,Great Britain to the Bolshevist Gov-ernment for the intervention of an Allied forcepredominantly American and Japanese throughSiberia; (b) to America sending a technical con-tingent to the Par East, with the addition of.a complete American division,srd Reading President Wilson declared to Lord Reading31-Noa 1833,pril 26th.        on April 26th that he would reconsider the wholeproblem viewed by the new light upon it.   He said he was anxious that the situation should be closely watched in orde/r not to be led into a trap by Trotsky and that he was expecting the &quot;arrival of documents purporting to prove that Trotsky and Lenin were in the pay of the German * Governments   The proposal for an American force could not be carried out because of the lack of * shipping, though a regiment might be sent,    Th-:. President considered that the arrival of Viscount Ishii presented a favourable opportunity of as-certaining
ascertaining Japan&apos;s views, and suggested a can-. . ference between Viscount Ishii, Mr,Lansing, Baker and Lord Heading,   He was doubtful whether Japan would intervene at all, and mere particularly if she was to he accompanied by American and Allied contingentSoOn iviay 7th Mr.Lansing informed Lord Heading that the President was convinced that the moment was not opportune or that a sufficient military advantage would be gained, and that consequently he could not at present concur in the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   Lord Heading is sure that he remains unconvinced that the balance of advantage and disadvantage is in favour of action at present.Foreign 0fficeoMay 10th.1918.
