THB GOI/IIdlTTES ON UNEMPLOYMENT DUE TO R3STKICTI0B OF WfoMTW RA+7 rJATERIAXS *In War Cabinet 320 of January 11th, 1918 (Minute 13) a Committee was appointed tq consider the question of Unemployment duo to Restriction of Imports of Raw Materials.The composition of the Committee was as follows:-The President of the Board of Trade   (CHAIRMAN) The Minister of National Service, The Minister of Labour.Tho President of the Local Government Board (addedsubsequently).Colonel F. J. Byrne , C .MG.(See rotary.)Five meetings have been hold and the following Interim Report is submitted for the information of tho War Cabinet.Jotton Trade.In this industry decrease in employment is met by what is known as the rota system worked in conjunction with a levy fund.   The rota system is, briefly, one by which instead 3f all operatives working short hours., or sometimes being left entirely without -vork, full time is worked by as many as can be employed and the unemployable surplus go out in rotation, e.g. one week out of work to three weejss in work, and receive unemployment pay while out of work from the levy Fund.   This Levy Fund is paid by the Employers but in practice a considerable proportion of its total has been indirectly contributed by the operatives owing to their having delayed and reduced their demand for increased wages in return   for the payment of the levy by the Employer.   It is estimated that the total receipts from the levies will have reached  1,000,000 before the end of May.Up to December 1917 more than  300,0.00 had been accumulated by means of the levy as the nucleus of a reserve fund.   There was a prospect of this sum proving insufficient to tide ftver the period up to Juno 10th,(the date of the termination of the existing agreement between masters and men with regard t  the Levy)   especially in view o&quot; the further restriction of cotton imports amounting to more than 200,000 tons for the year 1918 as oompared with 1917, imposed in February, and tho Treasury accordingly agreed to sanction a grant of  500,000 towards meeting any deficit that might occur up till June 10th. This grant has not yet besn drawn upon but there is every prospect that the reserve fund will be exhausted by June and the Treasury have accordingly been asked to extend permission to draw on this sum over the following 6 months.
tie!4r    Flax Industry,The Elimination of Russia as a source of Supply and the rapidly increasing de&amp;attA for Aeapplane Linen fabric as well a the increasing Naval and Military&quot;Demands for other classes of heavier canvas and linen goods have necessitated measures baingj taken to conserve to the utmost all available supplies of Has and the Trade has accordingly been rationed with raw material.At the present rate of consumption, however, it is estimated that supplies of raw   materials will be exhausted during the present year unless measures are taken to restrict working hours in the Industry.To meet this situation the War Office propose to put into operation a scheme, in which both masters and men concurs The proposed arrangements are briefly as follows:-(a) That the hours worked in spinning and weaving ?lax and Hemp of certain specified descriptions should be reduced t( forty hours per week.of its equivalent in stoppage of machine!)(b) That a War Wage allowance equal to two thirds of til difference between the hours of work in Clause (a) and full &quot;tic should be paid to workers, the maximum allowance to be limited to seven shillings.i2* Munition Workers.At the request of the Minister of Munitions the Committa considered the question of the unemployment among Munition Workers which it was anticipated would arise when outs in the Munitions programme were in prospect owing to the necessity for further reduction in imports of raw material.It was agreed by the Committee that at the stage then reached they were not in a position to make any recommendations on the question which was still in an early state of development! and had not yet threatened to become acute.    In the meantime tlij Ministry of ifunitions, the Ministry of labour and the Ministry of national Service would see what steps could be taken to meet the situation by the means already available such as transfer of labour-The Committee felt in this connection that great caution I should be exercised in formulating any general scheme for the relief on unemployment to ensure that it did not embrace those Munition Workers, who had ;merely taken on the work as a temper ary war measure and did not possess what might be termed any form of vested interest in the industry from which they had beef! discharged.3.   Wool Trade,The Committee was informed that unemployment in the Wool Trade did not amount to more than a few hundred employees and was a problem of comparative unimportance.   The War Office expressed the opinion that the matter could be settled by agreement between Employers and operatives, and the Committee agreed that this would be the most satisfactory solution of the problem.
Tho Committee felt that it was within tho competence of the War Office to effect a settlement on these lines and agreed that there was no objection to the War Office proceeding on their own responsibility with the proposed scheme which did not, in the Committee1s opinion, require their formal recognition,5.   Jute Industry.It was stated to the Committee that the unemployment in the Scottish Jute Industry was unimportant amounting to under 300 unemployed.   The War Office state that this Industry instituted last month by agreement between employers and employed a scheme virtually identical with that described above as pro-posed for the Flax Industry.(Sgd.)
