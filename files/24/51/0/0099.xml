E. PROTHERO.21. 5. 18.
RKSulffS OF POOD PRODUCTION CAMPAIGN. (1917-1918).Interim report of the Director-General of Food Production(for England and Wales).It ia- now possible to give some results, to date, of the Government&apos;s efforts to increase home-grown supplies of corn and potatoes.An official and compulsory census, obtained on April 27th, 1918, from occupiers of land in England and Wales, shows the following total acreages up to that date.CORN AND POTATOES. (England and Wale3 only).CROP	ACRES	INCREASE OVER 1916		REMARKS		Acres	Percentage	Wheat Barley Oats Rye, Dredge Corn, and &apos; Pulse Potatoes	2,665,000 1,490,000 2,820,000 682,000 645,000*	752,000 58,000 735,000 280,000 217,000	* 39$ * 11$ * 35$ * 69$ 4 50$	Highest recorded since 1882 Highest on record by 20$ i -Highest on record by 27$ xMinlstry of Food Census               ^Total acre-age of Corn &amp; Potatoes England &amp; Wales.	8,302,000	4-2,042,000		INCREASE IN TILLAGE AREA.Complete returns of the acreage of grass land ploughed are not yet available but a compulsory census, taken on March 11th 1918, showed that over 1,800,000 acres of &quot;Permanent&quot; grass In England and Wales had been broken up by that date and it is estimated that a total addition of not less than 2,500,000 acres to the tillage area of England and Wales (as compared with 1916) has now been made.If, as may be anticipated from the recent forecasts of the Boards of Agriculture for Scotland (300,000) and Ireland (1,500,000), the corresponding addition to the tillage area in those two countries will approximate to 1,800,000 acres, the total for the United Kingdom will be well over 4,000,000 acres.HOME-GROWN BREADSTUFFS.The foregoing figures indicate that the total acreage in the United Kingdom under wheat, barley and oats., in 1918, will be the highest ever recorded in the history of British agriculture,   The acreage under potatoes will be the greatest since 1872. Particulars of other crops are not yet available.
It is, of course, not possible to foretell the quality of the coming harvest but, speaking generally, the present condition of crops is very promising and gives reasonable hope of at least an ^average yield.Proceeding upon this assumption, and further assuming that (after deducting seed and light corn) the whole of the wheat and barley crops, one-fifth of the total oat crop, and one-quarter of the potato crop (i.e. the surplus above normal consumption) could be made available for bread-flour in case of need, it may be reckoned that the United Kingdom harvest of 1918 could provide 40 weeks supply of bread-stuffs for lHo entire population, at the present scale of consumption and on the existing basis of milling.FEEDING STUFFS,^ne English and Welsh harvests would further provide concentrated feeding-stuffs for animals (in excess of the normal home production of oats reserved for this purpose) to the amount of some 500,000 tons, besides additional oat straw equivalent to at least 350,000 tons of hay.SAVING OF TONNAGE.Reckoned in tonnage, the net, saving in shipping resulting from the increased production of corn and potatoes, in England and Wales alone, should amount in the coming year to 1,500,000 tons.ALLOTMENTS.The foregoing figures relate only to holdings of one acre and.upwards and take no account of the increased produce from allotments and gardens.   These, however, contribute very largely to the supply of home-grown food.   The increase in the number of allot-ments alone, since 1916, is not less than 800,000 in England and Wales, or 140 per cent.The additional weight of food-stuffs produced by this expansion may be reckoned at not less than 800,000 tons above the normal.CONCLUSION.These results (so far as Great Britain is concerned) have been achieved under exceptional difficulties created by shortage of labour. In England and Wales alone there are over 200,000 fewer male labourers on the land to-day than in the year before the war, after crediting all military and prisoner labour furnished by the Government. This faot, by itself, is a sufficient proof of the energy, resource, and patriotism with which all sections of the agricultural community have devoted themselves to the service of their country.Director-General of Food Production.20. 5. 18.N.B.
