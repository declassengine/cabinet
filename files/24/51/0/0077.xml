u a-TUB MINISTER.1. On April 24th the War Cabinet approved proposals for the extension of the War Munition Volunteer Scheme, subject to the modification of the draft press announcement.   Attached are : (i) A revised press announcement ;(ii) Detailed instructions as to procedure;(iii) Draft letter to a workman who is surplus to the establishment where he isemployed, and refuses to enrol as a War Munitions Volunteer.2. The Department have consulted on the details of the scheme, Mr. Allan Smith, Mr. Frank Smith, Chairman of the Trade Union Advisory Committee, and another Member of the Committee, the Ministry of Labour, and the Ministry of National Service, as well as with the Committee of the Munitions Council which deals with the withdrawal of labour from munitions firms. The details of the scheme and of the press announcement have been revised in accordance with their suggestions. /3. Special attention is drawn to the fact that the scheme to be workable must be administered for Admiralty firms by the same authority and on the same lines as for Ministry of Munitions firms.Uth May, 1918.GD6664/1   4(3 ,5/18   HWWP)
DRAFT PRESS ANNOUNCEMENT.The Minister of Munitions has had under consideration the position created in the war industries by the calling to the Colours of large numbers of men employed on production. While the man-power employed on munitions is thus being depleted in order to meet the needs of the Army for men, it is essential to maintain,.and even in some directions to increase, output in order to meet the needs of the Army for munitions.The Minister appeals earnestly to all skilled workers who are eligible to become War Munitions Volunteers and who have not already enrolled, to enrol without delay, and by doing so to place their services at the disposal of the Minister for transfer, as and when necessary, to such work as he may direct in the national interest, and he hopes that the response to this appeal to workers to enrol will be sufficient to meet the needs of the situation.With a view to securing the economic use of the labour employed on the production of munitions for his department, the Minister has instructed his officers to undertake a careful survey of the labour employed in munitions firms. If, on investigation of the labour employed in any firm, responsible officers of the Ministry direct that workmen should be transferred elsewhere, such men will, if not already enrolled, be asked to enrol as War Munitions Volunteers, or te satisfy the Local Enlistment Complaints Sub-Committee that such enrolment would in their particular case involve great personal hardship, and that there are adequate reasons why they should not be transferred to a distance from their homes. This Committee will be empowered to modify, in certain cases, the terms of the obligation so that they shall not involve the transfer of a workman away from his home.The Minister desires to point out that the justification for protecting a man from military service is not merely that he possesses certain industrial qualifications, but also that he is indispensable to the, work on which he is engaged, and that a man, though employed on munitions work, whose labour is not being used to the best advantage has no claim to continued protection from service in -the Army. It is proposed to offer to such men (unless they are of an age and medical grade from which men are being called up under the Schedule of Protected Occupations)\the - opportunity of transferring their services to work where their labour will be more fully utilised and where continued protection from military service can be justified..On the other hand, the Minister cannot continue to extend protection to those men whose services are not being fully utilised on their present work, and who refuse to place their services at his disposal for transfer to more urgent work.The maintenance and increase of the output of munitions can only be achieved by extending the principle of dilution and substitution.   The Minister realises that it will be necessary to extend dilution and substitution not only where the practice exists but to occupations in the munitions industry to which they have not been &apos; extended hitherto, and he relies confidently upon the whole-hearted co-operation of,GD6664/2   40   5/1S   HWV(P)[Labour
Labour Organisations and officials throughout the country to 1 assist him to the utmost of their power by impressing upon their members the urgency of the country&apos;s need.The Minister further realises that the present position calls for fresh and sustained efforts on the part of employers. It will be necessary that all employers should review with the utmost care the present use of the man-power in their employment, and place all possible facilities in the way of the Ministers officers in rendering men available for&apos; transfer. It- is the Ministers intention to apply extensively his powers under the Defence of the Realm Regulations to regulate and restrict the engagement or employment of any workman or classes of workmen in order to ensure not only -a more equitable distribution of labour throughout the industries for which he is responsible, but a better ^economy of the man-power remaining in the country.The Minister is aware that his proposals involve a heavy strain upon both employers and men ; but he is confident that in this time of great national need every one will realise the necessity of releasing the greatest possible number of men required for military service and the need of maintaining, at whatever sacrifice of personal convenience, the vital output of munitions.10 A May, 1918.
rafted.;j  (10*660/2   40  5/18   HWV(P)Procedure as to Dilution inspections and Enrolment ofWar Munition Volunteers.i. FUNCTIONS OF DILUTION OFFICERS.When the arrangements have been completed for a Dilution Inspection of any firm, the O.D.O. will, if he has reasons for placing the firm under embargo, immediately despatch to the firm a letter forbidding them to employ any further labour without special licence under 0.0. R.A. 8a (b), in order to stereotype for the time being the labour conditions prevailing in that firm. tThe Dilution Officer inspecting the firm will take with him a list of all the W.M.Vs. who according to the records of the Department are working there, and if, after inspection, he is satisfied that a certain number of workmen should be spared for munitions work elsewhere, he will inform the firm&apos; of the names of the men he considers should be transferred.The number of names will be at least 25% in excess of the actual number which the Dilution Officer considers should be &quot;removed, unless he finds he can only recommend certain specific men for removal. The firm may suggest names in substitution for those suggested by the Dilution Officer on the grounds that son&apos; e of those originally suggested were pivotal men. &quot;The Dilution Officers recommendations will be made on purely technical grounds, except that other things being equal he will, for the sake of convenience, select for transfer men who are already W.M.Vs., E Cs., or A.R.M.VV&amp;., but he will not in any way enquire into personal circumstances. If he finds it necessary to include men who are not enrolled, he will in preference select men below the age of 51.2. In all cases the Dilution Officer will leave with the firm a written statement of his recommendations, and in cases in which the firm does not agree with these, he will recommend to the firm that they should at once lay their views in writing before the C.D.O.The Dilution Officer will report to the O.D.O. who, after considering any communication which the firm may have made, will issue Dilution Instructions to the firm embodying L. 6 procedure.   A standard form of letter is being drafted.&apos;-&apos;&apos; . :,V-.&apos; -:     C    ::..-j-,&apos;-&apos;V- Va      &apos;;;-&apos;&apos;.--&apos;&apos;Y&apos;&apos;&apos;     &apos;-&apos;. \.&apos;    \r &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; &quot;&apos;&apos;:&apos;.&apos;&quot;S&apos;..;i..&apos;^&apos;In cases of difficulty (which will be defined for the guidance of the O.D.Os.) the C.D.O. will refer to Headquarters for adjudication. Headquarters will refer back to the C.D.O. informing him of the lines on which he may proceed and the Chief Dilution Officer will act accordingly.3.-FUNCTIONS OF ENROLMENT OFFICER.As soon as possible, but not less than 7 days from the date of the dilution letter, the C.D.O. will furnish the Enrol-ment Officer with a list of the names (including the 25% surplus) as recommended by the Dilution Officer, specially indicating those suggested by the firm as substitutes. The Enrolment Officer will visit the firm with the object of securing the enrolments desired up to the total required for transfer. In selecting the men for enrolment, he will have regard, as far as possible, to:  , *(a) Avoiding victimisation, especially as to the men whom the firm have suggested as substitutes;(6) Avoiding tho infliction of severe personal hardship arising out of domestic circumstances;(c) Selecting in preference men under 51. ,He will endeavour to secure voluntary enrolments from the men named on the list who are not already enrolled as W.M.Vs. up to the total number required for transfer, explaining to the workmen where necessary, the nature of the W.M.V. scheme,&apos;and its special provisions for protecting a transferred man from hardship. He will make careful notes of the facts of any case in which a man declines to enrol, and at the end of his visit he will ascertain whether he has attained his quota by voluntary enrolments. If he has not, he will there and then go carefully through the outstanding cases and will decide which men should be pressed to enrol.Having so decided he will: (a) Summon these man again before him, and once more press them to enrol.(6) Should any men still decline to enrol; the enrolment Officer will explain to him that in the opinion of the Dilution Officer the work which he is doing is not of such a nature as justifies his,continued retention in his present employment, or his continued protection from military service if he is of an age and medical grade or category from which men are being called up for service, although, having regard to his qualifications, such protection could be continued for the present.in accordance with the Schedule of Protected Occupations, were he ,employed upon other work of a more urgent or difficult nature. He will carefully give the workmen to linder-stand, however, that if his refusal to enrol is based upon grounds of personal hardship, any appeal on these grounds which hevmay wish to make will be carefully considered by the local Enlistment Complaints Sub-Committee, provided that his appeal is lodged within seven days. He will explain that this Sub-Committee may either recommend that he should not &quot;be enrolled for the present, or that a modified form of enrolmentI should be adopted, which will &quot;guard against his transfer to work rendering it necessary for him to live: away - from home. Should he not lodge any such appeal, however, or the Sub-Committee reject his appeal, and he continue in his resusal to enrol, he will be called up for military service forthwith, if he is of an age and medical, grade Or category from which men at the time are being called up for military service. Care should be taken that the workmau fully appreciates the special allowances -which he may be eligible to receive on transfer as,   a W.M.V. ,    ,&apos; &apos;.  &apos;   - ,   N . ,&apos; &apos;    :&apos;       .The Enrolment Officer will, at the srme time, hand the workman a formal notification (M.M. ) explainingclearly his position as regards enlistment and a form of appeal to the Sub-Committee (Form L.E.C. ),on which he will write the address of the appropriate Sub-Committee.MM. 192.1533
(c) Tho Enrolment Officer, in order&apos;to provide for the contingency of the man (hanging his mind and enrolling a fewdays subsequently, will-also furnish him with a copy of a ,printed post card addressed to the Enrolment Officer., This post card will read as follows :-&quot;I bog to inform you that I enrolled as a W.M.V, on......Employment Exchange.   My eniolment numbers areName..............................Address        ..........&apos;..........Date...........(d) The Enrolment Officer will notify the appropriate Sub-Committee on Form (L.E.C. ) of the issue of &apos; (Form M.M.           ) by the workman.(e) The Enrolment Officer will make a report on evory firm visited, showing the men actually enrolled, and anyspecial arrangement made as regards rate in cases of employment upon high piece rates of upstanding wage, and with regard to the men who he thinks should enrol but who have declined to enrol, he will give the fullest possible particulars as to their reasons for.refusing. One copy of this report he will retain, one he will, send to the C.D.O., and one to the VV.M. V. and A.U.M.W. Section. It is essential that this report should be rendered . within 48 hours.-4.-FUNCTION5 OF ENLISTMENT COMPLAINTS SUBCOMMITTEE.A man appealing to an Enlistment Complaints Sub-Committee may claim, on the ground of severe personal hardship either--      .   &apos;* . \(a) That he should not be required to enrol at present; or,(6) That the terms of enrolment should be modified in such a way as will render it unnecessary for him to live ansray from home. . r,The appeal must be lodged within seven days from the date upon which the notification form mentioned at 3 (b) above is handed or sent to the man. The Sub-Committee will be instructed to satisfy themselves that there will be real and substantial hardship before they grant the appeal. &quot; ...The Sub-Committee may refuse a claim or decide in favour of a modified enrolment, but should not themselves decide that a man peed not enrol at the present time, but whenever they think the facts may justify such a, decision, they should report the case to the Main Committee for action. They may refer any cases to, the Main Committee if they so desire. - , - (Immediately on receipt of an appeal, the Sub-Committee will report the receipt to the C.D.O. for transmission to the Enrolment Officer, and a similar report will be sent when the decision has been taken.5. In tho event,of a man refusing to enrol upon grounds which are considered insufficient by the Sub-Committee, or in the event of his failure to lodge an appeal within the specified time he will, if of an age and medical grade or category for which men are at the time being called up for military service, have his protection withdrawn and will be called up for military service forthwith. For this purpose the Enrolment Officer will notify the appropriate M.A.D.O. on (Form B.P.O.      t     ), requesting him to arrange for the man to be called up.6.-SUBSEQUENT  PROCEDURE.It will be for the Enrolment Officer at the end of ten days from the date of his visit, as in paragraph 3 above, to clear up all the outstanding cases from each firm. The outstanding cases will consist of all the men to whom he has handed or sent the notification in paragraph 3 (b) above, and who have not since enrolled as W.M.V.S., They will be classified thus: 1. Men who have not made appeals. , 2. Men who have made appeals which have not yet been determined.3. Men who have made appeals which have been refused.&apos; 4. Men who have made appeals which have been granted by relieving the man from the necessity of enrolment at the present time. t    , ;5. Men who have made appeals which have been granted by way of allowing restricted enrolments. Cases 1 and 3 will require immediate action under paragraph 5.Case 4.   The firm must,&apos; if. possible, supply a substitute of similar qualifications and experience.Case 5 will require verification that the man has in fact enrolled.   If he does not enrol he will be dealt with under paragraph 5.&apos;     Case 2 must be followed up when the decision of the Sub-Committee is given. .   .;   ,The Enrolment Officer will make a report on all these cases showing the position of each and taking care in a casts to state the man&apos;s name, private address, age and medical.grade, if known (he should have obtained these particulai from the firm&apos;s register during his visit).

Any further communication should be Hdresaed to THE SECRETARY,ad the following letter and number should la quoted:-If elephone Number : Victoria, 8660.* MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS OF WAR, 6, Whitehall Gardens,LONDON, S.W.I,Letter to be handed by the Enrolment Officer to a workman who refuses to enrol as a War Munitions Volunteer.Dear Sir,1. I am directed to draw your attention to the Memorandum printed on the back of this letter, and to inform you that on account of the need for making certain readjustments in the firm where you are employed, and of increasing the supply of mobile labour available for transfer to urgent war work, it is necessary to ask you to place your services at the disposal of the Ministry of Munitions. I am, therefore, to urge you in the national interest to enrol within seven days from the date of this letter as a War Munitions Volunteer, and as soon as you have enrolled, you should fill up and despatch the attached postcard.2. As is explained in the Memorandum an the back of this letter, it is open to you to represent to the Enlistment Complaints Sub-Committee for your district that there are good reasons why you should not enrol; any such application must be made within seven days from the dale of this letter on the enclosed form .L.E.C. .   If you do not enrol or apply to the Sub-Committeewithin seven days, there will be no alternative but to lay the facts before the Ministry of Munitions in order that they may consider whether there is sufficient justification for continuing your protection from military service.3. If you apply to the Sub-Committee, they may decide either that you should not be asked to enrol, or that the terms of your enrolment shall be modified so as to ensure that you will not be transferred to work which will necessitate your living away from home, or that you should enrol without condition.4. If the Sub-Committee decide that you should enrol either with or without modification of the terms of your enrolment, you must do so at once, or it will be necessary to report your name to the Ministry of Munitions in order that they may consider whether there is sufficient justification for continuing your protection from Military Service.- Yours faithfully, &apos;. M. 191.
MEMORANDUM.A. The severe calls which are now being made upon the man-power of this country render it more imperative than ever that men not serving with H.M. Forces should be distributed upon work of national importance with the utmost economy- and advantage&quot; It is the duty of all men possessing special industrial qualifications to make themselves available for transfer to urgent work of national importance, in order that the needs created by the withdrawal of men for the Army and the sudden&apos; changes caused by alterations in the munitions programme or in the supply of materials may be met.B. It has been realised that hardship may be caused to a workman transferred to another estab-lishment if no special arrangements are made as to the payments he may there receive, and for this purpose the War Munitions Volunteer scheme was instituted by the National Advisory Committee. Information as to the conditions of enrolment can be obtained at any Employment Exchange ; it should be remembered that a workman who on transfer finds that the conditions of employment cause him serious hardship, or that his special skill is not being fully utilised, may apply to the Ministry of Munitions for transfer, when his request is at once investigated.C. The Minister of Munitions has instructed his local officers to survey carefully the labour employed in firms manufacturing munitions of war. If on inspection of any establishment-the Dilution Officer decides that a certain proportion of the labour employed in it ought in the national interest to be made available for transfer to other or more urgent war work, he will prepare a list of suitable men who will be asked to enrol*Hs*War Munitions Volunteers, so that they be transferred either at once or when an urgent need arises.D. If a man considers that on account of his domestic circumstances or for other reasons, the terms of enrolment will involve him in severe personal hardship, he may apply to the Enlistment Complaints Sub-Committee for the district, who will be able to decide either : (i) That be should not be asked to enrol at present; or(ii) That the conditions of enrolment should be modified, so that the man is not transferred to workwhich would render it necessary for him to live away from home; or(iii) That he should be asked to enrol unconditionally.&quot;&apos; . :    v   &apos; -      &apos; . -    &quot; &quot; t - \ &apos;If the Sub-Committee decide that the man ought to be asked to enrol, either with or without modification of the terms, and the man refuses to enrol, his name will be reported to the Ministry of Munitions, in order that they may consider whether sufficient justification exists for continuing his protection from military service.E. The justification for protecting a man of military age from military service under the Schedule of Protected Occupations, M.M. 130 (Revised), is not merely that he possesses certain industrial qualifi-cations, but also that he is indispensable to the work on which he is engaged. When, subject to the safeguards set out above, a man of militaryNage has been asked to enrol as a War Munitions Volunteer, he cannot be regarded as having any&quot; valid claim to continued protection from- military service, even though employed upon munitions work, unless by enrolling as a War Munitions Volunteer, he places his services at the disposal of the Ministry of Munitions for transfer to any other work of national importance upon which they may be needed.10fA May, 191,8.
