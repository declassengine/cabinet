RJ5K03&amp;OTATION OF W PEOPLE ACT, 1916./. /77/V&apos;).,-,;Iiifft of Parliament and Preparation of Hew Register.Further ideoio rand urn by the President of the Local Government Board.1.    As desired by the War Cabinet I have conferred with representatives of the War Office and the Scottish Office with regard to the preparation of the new Register.   A representative of the Lord Chancellor1a Department was also present aa any modification of dates might affect the work to be done by the County Court Judges in dealing with appeals from the decisions of the Registration Officer.In paragraphs 12 to 14 i put forward some alterna-tive proposals which I hope will meet the views of my colleagues.2.    As regards the War Office the position is that, owing to the military situation on the Western 3?ront since March 21st, it was considered impossible to set in motion the machinery provided for getting the necessary information from soldiers.   The V/ar Office have now decided, after communication with General Head Quarters in Franoe, that the work of dis-tributing the postoards, many millions in nuaber, to the troops and otherwise setting in motion the Machinery of the Record Offices can be begun almost immediately, and this will be dona. It is estimated that the bulk, or at any rate a fair proportion, of the postcards ought to be in the hands of Registration Officers within a month from now.   It must, however, be remembered that the date fixed for the publication of the Electors listo is loth June, i.e., exactly a month to-day,and that, even if the estimate made by the \/ar Office proves accurate, a very large number of the postcards will not be received by the Registration Offioers in time for the par-tioulars which they contain to be inserted in these lists.3.     I have carefully compared the position in Scotland with that in England and V/alee and have come to the con-elusion that no decision should be based upon the comparison. The Registration system in Scotland is, I find, essentially different.   There are many more Registration Officers in Scotland on a population basis than in England.     In England the Registration Officer acts for a Parliamentary County or Parliamentary Borough which may be divided into a number of separate constituencies.   In Scotland not only is there a Registration Officer for every constituency but in some areas   * I am informed there are several Registration Officers in the same constituency some of whom act for quite small areas, such as some of the Royal burghs.    Again, in England and Wales the old machinery of registration has been scrapped and a new system inaugurated.   In Scotland precisely the same officers -are doing the worlc as hitherto.
4.    Apart from this, I am informed by the Scottish Offioe that the statement made by the Registration Officers in Scotland that the work could be dona v.&apos;ithin the time fixed by the Order in Council was made in ignorance of the fact that the arrangements with the War Office were not proceeding as originally planned.    The Scottish Offioe were not aware until yesterday that not a single postcard had yet been distributed and there is no reason to doubt that the Registration Officers even in Scotland are relying on the information contained in these postcards to supple-men t and correct the information obtainable locally.6.     The question of the ability of the County Court Judges to do the appeal work raises an incidental point of some difficulty, and I understand that it is doubtful in any oaee whether this work can be done within the period allotted.6.    Apart from the fallacy of comparing the position in Scotland with that in this country, 1 would impress upon the Cabinet the urgenoy of the demand from the Registration Officers for an extension of time.   This demand proceeds from bodies representing the great towns outside London, from the Metropolitan area, and from the Counties.7.     The Law Committee of the Association of Municipal Corporations my that if the work of registration is to be done adequately it will be necessary to enlarge the time; that it has been found that the house-to-house canvass will occupy a much longer period than was anticipated;   and that there are great difficulties in regard to the printing and also in regard to tho naval and military voters.   They urge that steps be taken to postpone the dates.8.     The London Borough Officers&apos; Association suggest that the time should be extended for the printing and publica-tion of the Lists:   they say that at a meeting of the Association it was ascertained that Registration Officers generally in London found it quite impossible to be ready with the publication of the new Lists on the prescribed date, viz; 10til June next.9.    Sir Charles Longmore telegraphing on 10th  lay on behalf of tho County Registration Officers says;   &quot;ITo cards are coming in from either army or navy:   if soldiers and sailors are to get on register at all everything must depend on house-to-house canvass;   if this is to be efficiently carried out more time must be given for printing and publiea-tion of lists;   suggest that dates should be altered so as to bring register into existence first January next;   this is the unanimous view of members of society of clerks of peace for counties&quot;.
10.   A number of representations from individual registration offioera for both boroughs and counties confirm these views.11.   We must remember that some millions of newly enfranchised electors have to be put upon the new register, and that Parliament has insisted upon every effort being made to put soldiere and sailors upon the register) and I aid convinced that there is, und*r present abnormal conditions, a serious risk of hundreds of thousands of them being left off that Keginter if you insist upon bringing a register into force by the int October,12,   1 entirely appreciate the reasons given by the Prime kinister for desiring a new register at the earliest possible date, and I would make th? following suggestion, which X think may go a long way to meet the difficulties of the situation.13.   The material dates under the Order in Council arePublication of lists .......lb JuneLast day for objections to lists 29 JuneLast day for claims ,...,........ 6 JulyPublication of lists ofobjections ................... 8 JulyPublication of lists ofclaimants .................... 13 JulyLast day for objections toclaimants.............26 JulyPublication of lists of objeo-tions to claimants as soon as practicable after............ 2S JulyPublication and coming intoforce of iiegieter ............ 1 October,14.   aiy suggestion is that the first date (the date for publication of the lists) be postponed for a fortnight. This will be of material assistance to the Registration Officers in their work and will admit of a very much larger proportion of Army postcards being received and dealt with.     I think it may be possible to close up somewhat the other dates between lb June and 26 July although this may provoke criticism.   The period between 26 July and 1st October cannot be shortened, as within that time the whole of the revision work (whioh now takes some 0^weeks) will have to be done as well as the appeal work by the County Ctfurt Judges, the correction of the lists, and their final printing off as a Register.   1 suggest that this post-ponement of a fortnight for tin publication of&apos;the lists be made at once and that the question of postponing the data of coming into force of the 4f)gister (1st October) be allowed to stand over.   If it is found, say at the end of August, that an extra two or three weeks are needed this Can be effected if circumstances are then favourable,W. HAYES FI3HSK,Government Board.l&amp;th May, 1918.
