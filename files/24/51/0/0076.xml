This first phase of German activity in the Middle East produced little result. The Amir held to his neutrality, the German mission failed to bring the pro-German element in Afghanistan into power, and the head of it, von Henting, returned to Berlin by way of Eastern Turkestan and China. In Persia, too, the advance of the Russians to Kermanshah and Ispahan, and the formation of the South Persian Rifles under Sir Percy Sykes, led to the flight or arrest of the German agents. The British forces advanced in Mesopotamia, and when Bagdad fell and the armies of General Maude and General Saratov joined hands on the line of the Diala in April 1917 the German door into the Middle East was momentarily closed.Only momentarily, however, for the Russian Revolution had occurred a few weeks before. The Russian troops in Persia were among the first to succumb to disorgani-sation. The road through Northern Persia was thrown open again. Trans-Caucasia and Central Asia became accessible to German and Turkish propaganda. After the second, or Bolshevik, revolution of November 1917 these regions practically severed their connection with Petrograd and set up local governments. Since that time they have been at the mercy of the enemy Powers, and though in Mesopotamia and Southern Persia the British position has been greatly strengthened during the past year, the new&quot; road through Trans-Caucasia, Northern Persia, and Central Asia offers Germany more favourable opportunities for stirring up trouble in Afghanistan and on the North-West Frontier of India than she has possessed at any previous period of the war.The Germans have evidently been seeking to take advantage of these opportunities by sending out fresh agents and missions. - Our information about this second phase of German activity in the Middle East is inevitably vague and defective, but, in view of the dangerous developments that may follow from it, it may be worth while to set out briefly as many as possible of the facts or rumours in our possession.(i.) Plans of the Enemy Governments.Conferences between leading German and Turkish politicians, at which general programmes were laid down, are reported to have been held at Berlin on the 1st August, 193 7, and the 21st January, 1918, and a special meeting of the C.U.P. at Constantinople on the 15th March, 1918. There seems also to have been a staff conference at Constantinople on, the 21st October, 1917, about propaganda in Trans-Caucasia, and a permanent propaganda committee appears to have been set up in the&apos; Turkish War Office under Enver&apos;s presidency some time before April 1918.The general plan evidently is to prepare the ground by propaganda and to follow this up with military operations when and where local co-operation can be counted upon. There is no evidence that the despatch of large forces is contemplated. The idea rather seems to be to send the minimum forces that will set local movements in motion and to leave these movements to do the rest. Stress is laid on securing the command of the Black Sea and Trans-Caucasia ; Northern Persia, Russian Central Asia, and Afghanistan are the objectives, and it is hoped that effects will be produced in China and India.
(ii.) Enemy Missions,(a.) The original German mission, under von Henting, in 1915. Members of tins mission seem still to have been in Afghanistan in April 1.917.(6.) A second German mission, under von Heating and Asaf Bey, was reported to be starting from Constantinople at the end of October 1917, but apparently it was still at Constantinople in March. If this March mission is the same as that of October, it had been strengthened meanwhile by the addition of trained Persian propagandists. Persian propagandists are also mentioned in April 1918 as having been sent out from Constantinople with Turkish officers. Whether this is a separate mission is again uncertain.(a) In November 1917 the German Foreign Office was reported to be sending Prince Rokn-es-Saltane from Switzerland on a mission to Persia-possibly to Luristan(d.) In April 1918 a mission of Osmanli Ulema, under Colonel Ali Rani Bey, was reported to be starting from Constantinople for Bokhara.Our information about all these missions comes from the &quot; departure&quot; end. There is no news of their arrival at their destinations, or of effects produced by them.(iii.) Enemy Agents,There are innumerable rumours of German and Turkish agents in Central Asia and European Russia, Northern&apos; Persia and Trans-Caucasia (especially the last). Their numbers are almost certainly exaggerated, and the information generally comes from the place of despatch and not from the place of. arrival. There is no evidence of results produced by these agents in proportion to the numbers alleged. The following cases, however, seem of serious importance : (a.) Ubeiclullah. This Turkish agent, who had been arrested and. interned in Persia earlier in the war, escaped, and reached Berlin about November 1917. He has since been sent back to Persia. The Persian Government has been afraid to rearrest him. He is said to be in touch with the &quot;Turkish agents in Central Asia. Corre-spondence has been intercepted between him and the Jangali leader Kuchik Khan, but he does not seem to have gained Kuchik Khan&apos;s confidence. In April 1918 he was reported on his way to Mazanderan.(b.) Akchura Oghlu Yussuf, the Kazan Tatar irredentist, who has been at Oonstan-tinople since the Balkan war, was reported in January to have arrived at Petrograd on his way to Central Asia, but there is no further news of him.(c.) Four Turkish propagandists appeared in January 1918 in Ferghana, and in April Turkish agents were still reported, to be at large in the west of the Chinese Empire.[d.) There is practically no mention of propaganda literature, except for a bilingual pamphlet in Persian and Tatar published in the last quarter of 1917.(e.) The Osmanli Ulema were reported averse to Pan-Islamic propaganda in August 1917 ; but in two cases since then Uiema have&quot; been mentioned among the propagandists sent to the Moslems in Russia.(iv.) Enemy Troops in Persia.Persia was practically clear of enemy troops from April 1917 to April 1918. On the 14th April, 1918, detachments were first reported in Azerbaijan, but up to date they have only appeared in small strength in the neighbourhood of the frontier. The majority are Turks, but in. one place 100 Germans have been seen with, eight guns.(v.) Enemy Prisoners of War in Russia.The rumours about enemy prisoners of war are like those about enemy agents  their alleged activities are disproportionate to the results produced. On the whole, the prisoners of war in Central Asia have remained remarkably passive. Until the beginning of 1918, at any rate, they seem to have been kept under control, and many of them belong to the disaffected Austrian nationalities or to classes susceptible to Bolshevik ideals. On the other hand, a weighty American witness, who was in Turkestan during March and&apos; April 19! 8, and who estimates their numbers at 30,000 Austrians and 8,000 Germans, considers them &quot;a threat to British India,&quot;
(vi.) Article X of the Armistice between Russia and the Enemy Powers, signed on December 15, 1011.This article, which proscribes the evacuation, independence, and integrity of Persia, was prepared for in the Turkish Parliament on the 1st November, 1917, and was applauded by the Persian diplomatists and irredentists in Germany. It has been well advertised by the German propaganda, and has been followed up in pronounce-raents by enemy statesmen, eg., by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs.(vii.) Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed on March 3,1918.In article vii of the treaty, article x of the armistice was reaffirmed, and Afghanistan was this time included. -During April 1018 a circular note from the Persian Government was handed to the foreign Ministers of various countries, announcing that all treaties or agreements infringing on the integrity and independence of Persia were null and void, and mentioning specifically the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907.(viii.) Turkish and German Economic Penetration.The Germans are anxious to secure free transit through Russia to Persia and Afghanistan, which was denied them under the Russo-German Commercial Treaty of 1894. This question was discussed in the Reichstag during the Brest-Litovsk negotiations, and the German press appears to assume that a modification of the 1894 Treaty in Germany&apos;s favour to this effect has been provided for in the Russo-German Economic Annexe to the Treaty of the 3rd March, 1918. No such provision is discoverable, however, in the published text.In February .1918 there was uneasiness in Germany lest the repudiation of the 1907 Convention by the Bolsheviks should imperil the German interests in Persia recognised in the Russo-German Agreement of 1910.In April there was a significant, though, unconfirmed, rumour that German firms were demanding a monopoly of the Turkestan cotton crop for forty-eight years.(ix.) Dealings between the Persian Government and the Enemy Powers.Germany and Turkey are known to have twice offered guarantees to Persia in the event of a rupture with the Entente, in October 1917 and&apos;in March 1918.During the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, Persia is said to have asked Germany and Turkey for parts of Russian Trans-Caucasia which formerly belonged to her. A Persian delegation to Berlin in March 191.8 was ostentatiously entertained, and they are said to have asked for Persian participation at the Peace Conference. Germany seems to have demanded a high price for these favours. Turkey appears anxious to bring Persia into a definite treaty relation with herself, but the Persian Government is reported to mistrust Turkish, intentions.Husein Kuli. Khan, the Persian Ambassador at Berlin, is an ardent pro-German, and. has been training young Persians as propagandists.(x.) Afghanistan.There is no real evidence that the Amir has changed his policy or that he intends to do so, nor, again, that the pro-German element in the country is getting out of hand. &apos; Statements to the contrary effect appear to be either deliberate inspirations of German propaganda or merely inferences from the fact that the breakdown of Russia has made the Amir a freer agent than he was before.The story of an Afghan mission to Russian Central Asia turns out to be a misunderstanding. The party referred to really consisted of Mahindra Pratap (the Indian member of the original German mission in 1915) and his followers, who left Afghanistan via Russia after the Revolution. Afghanistan has so far maintained a perfectly correct policy of non-intervention in Russian affairs.(xi.) Policy of Turkey towards the Russian Moslems.The Turkish desire for Batnm, Ears, and Ardehan is evidently no more than an extension of the principle of &quot; integrity &quot; into that of&quot; disannexation.&quot; In all probability it has little psychological connection with the aggressive policy of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turanianism.
On the other hand, there is evidence that Turkey wishes to bring all the Caucasian Moslems under her permanent protectorate. But she does not expect to incorporate the more scattered or remote Moslem elements of the former Russian Empire; and she is therefore in favour of their remaining inside Russia, in order to exert an Islamic influence on Russian policy. When the German occupation of the Crimea became imminent, however, the Turkish press began to agitate for the self-deter-mination of the Crimean Tatars.In Central Asia Turkey seems to aim principally at creating a cultural bond, but Dr. Nazim&apos;s policy of making concessions to Great Britain in Arabia in exchange for a free hand in &quot; Turan &quot; may reappear hereafter.(xii.) Attitude of the Trans-Caucasian Tatars.The Trans-Caucasian Tatars are reported to be violently anti-British in feeling, but by no means anxious to come under Turkish rule. They would like to return to their connection with Russia, either in a federal form or even by the restoration of the old regime.   Their leaders, however, are pro-German.(xiii.) Future of Azerbaijan.There is a movement among the Trans-Caucasian Tatars to detach Azerbaijan from Persia and unite it to themselves in an Azerbaijani-Tatar national State, possibly under Turkish suzerainty. The Trans-Caucasian Tatars and Azerbaijani Turks speak the same dialect, are both predominantly Shia, and were never separated politically till the Russian conquest of Trans-Caucasia a century ago.This proposal, however, comes entirely from the Tatar side, and finds no support in Azerbaijan itself. The democratic party leaders at Tabriz, the Shahsevans and the Jangalis are all strongly opposed to it.
