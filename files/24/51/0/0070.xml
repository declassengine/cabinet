m(Thte Document is the Property^ o  HSs Britannic tWajesty&apos;s Government)Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Report for week ending Mav 14th. 1918,.Land Division,.Small Holding Colonies.Holbeaoh.     The farming operations are well advanced and practically all the seeds are now sown.    All corn crops are looking excellent.     The labour is at present plentiful, and the cleaning of the corn crops is well in hand.    Four of the most unsatisfactory soldiers have been returned to their Depots.     The horses are busy scarifying and harrowing amongst the potatoes.     There still remain one hundred pigs to be sold which will be effected before long.Heath Hill.   The farming operations consisted chiefly of working for and drilling mangolds and the preparation of the acreage allotted for potatoes, which is taking time owing to the amount of &quot;couch&quot; in the particular fieldb.    A start has been made with planting and four acres were planted on Saturday.    Arrangements are now approaching completion for the forming of a Hostel for women workers at King Street Grange Farm House.Patrington.     The weather has been very varied and cold, particularly at nights, which has retarded the growth of the grass. The crops, with the exception of the oats, are looking well.     The farm operations on the Colony during the week included the preparation and sowing of the land with mangolds, drilling clover and rolling wheat. The crops, produoe and stock disposed of during the week included 10 qrs. oats, 2 cwt. potatoes, 2 bullocks, 12 pigs, 8 dozen chicks, and 1074 eggs.Kelham Estate.Many applications have been received with reference to the scheme of distribution of sugar beet seed for a feeding stuff for pigs and cattle, and in the case of the small-holders for syrup making for jam and for domestic purposes, and seed to the extent of nearly two tons has been supplied.    A great many applications have been refused during the last few days, not only because the time is now late for sowing, but because of the difficulty in insuring the arrival of seed. Further, the Food Production Department advised that a certain balance should be retained for next year in view of the shortage.   Insurances of the property controlled by the Committee are being revised in order that the terms of the mortgage may be adequately met.     This is being carried out with the assistance of one of the leading Insurance Companies, who have made a complete survey of the property.Flax Production-Branch.Further groups of City Workers have been despatched during the week to Suffolk, to assist in the weeding of the crop.     Owing to the spell of two weeks of bad weather which occurred in the middle of seeding time, it is feared that this operation will be somewhat protracted.   Charlock has been reported as troublesome in several areas, and four Sprayers have been purchased and despatched.     The selection of premises or sites for the Factories and desteding Stations is now complete, with the exception of three oases still awaiting decision.    A considerable proportion of the necessary machinery has been ordered and in one instance, that of deseeding rollers, delivery has commenced.
Tithe, Commons, Copyhold and Survey. Branch.Among the applications received during the past week have &quot;been four Altered Apportionments and six Redemptions of tithe-rent charge , and two for tho Enfranchisement of Copyholds;   while three Altered Apportionments and nine Redemptions, and one merger of tithe rentcharge, and four enfranchisements of Copyhold have been confirmed.    A considerable number of communications have been received from incumbonts of parishes protesting against any bill amending in favour of the landowners the provisions for variation in the Tithe Act, 1836, until the average tithe rentcharge .for the whole period since the passing of that Act has reached par value, and until the lav; relating to the rating of tithe rentcharge has been modified in favour of titheowners.Joint Committee of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheriesi tne j3oard 01 agncu and Ministry&apos; of Pood.Qheese and Kilk.    In some districts where cheese could be made, farmers are not inclined to do so fearing the price would be lowered after they had procured the plant and commenced to manufacture it*    There is at present a lack of confidence among ths farmers in this respect.    There is also a hesitancy in som? Counties to proceed with the organisation of Milk Collecting Depots owing to the uncertainty as to milk prices and to the dissatisfaction at the treatment received by the farmers.    Farmsre generally are demonstrating considerable feeling at the position occupied by the Trading community under the system of control now instituted.    Some examination of the relation of the &quot;middleman&quot; to the working of the various Orders seems necessary in order to restore the confidence of the producer, bearing in mind the almost continuous rise in his expenses and the limitations imposed upon his profits by fixed prices, diminished skill in his labour, and inadequate supplies of necessities.Diseased Potatoes as a pig and poultry, food.    A means for converting diseased potatoes into a valuable pig and poultry food has been brought to the notice of the Joint Committee *    Immediately the potatoes are lifted they are put through an ordinary turnip cutter and care must be taken that the potatoes are free from stones and dirt.    They should then be placed in an oven and baked until they are thoroughly dry.    For pig food they can be used in slices and for poultry the slices should be ground in an ordinary coffee mill, when the potato comes out in the form of a dark coloured grit and of the oharacter of ground oyster shells.    A fine powder can also be made*    Poultry eat it with great avidity.    Samples were submitted to the University College of lorth Wales, Bangor, for analysis and the report stated that &quot;The dried potatoes shouM be quite  a good food with about 8-10$ albuminoids, a trace of fat, about 80$ starch material and a little fibre and ash.    They should be as good, bulk for bulk as wheat offals etc.&quot;Meetings have been held during the week at&quot;Maidstone, Swansea, Bridgend, Cardiff and Ipswich.!Qrdnance Survey.During the weekending 15th May 1918, 71,509 maps were sent to Prance and 16,667 to the Admiralty.    10 relief models were sent to Franco.Publications Branch.The number of applications for ordinary issues of the Leaflets was 1736, in response to which 7714 copies of leaflets were despatched.    In addition 40,000 copies of leaflets v?ere despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.
174 &quot;125,000 copies of Leaflets were supplied to the Food Production Department for distribution direct by that Departments    A further supply of 41,000 leaflets was sent to the Government Information Bureaux for distribution as explained in previous Reports *    During the week Food Production Leaflet No. 42 (The Cultivation of Buckwheat) was published and copiee distributed to 10,000 persons on the Leaflet list.AdjnilL^ The Division has been oonsulted by theIsle of Man Hilihesy Department with regard to the proposed new trawling regulations off the Coasts of that Island.    Approval has been, given to the form and position of a gauge for measuring water discharged from the Paignton Reservoirs:   the work was a statutory duty under the Paignton Water Acts and involved considerable correspondence and engineering details    Applications for fishing facilities at Crlccieth, Southport, and other plaoes are under consideration.EeJffiJ^52ilJSa*    27 permits have been issued in respeot of fishing vessels and 49 cancelled.    A notice has been issued to fishermen at certain ports on the&apos; South Coast prohibiting trawling in certain areaB in which enemy mines have been sunk without exploding.Me tcr^ Loan,Sectipn*    The past week has been one of great activityo    No less than seven vessels have run their trials successfully at various stations.    As must necessarily happen in entrusting engines to the unmechanical fishermen, troubles from time to time arise and while things as a whole have been running extremely smoothly there bavs occasionally been reports of serious engine troubles.    This was the case with a large vessel - one of the largest installations the Committee have oarried out -belonging to the Padstow Patrol.    The engine was in charge of a boy who had received a small amount of training on a Bimilar engine but who could not let well alone.    Very serious trouble was caused on the engine and an engineer had to be sent for from Glasgow and the work took four full days to complete.    This trouble has led thff Committee to obtain the services of an engineer thoroughly conversant with heavy oill engines to take charge Of tho Padstow Patrol and in this way it is hoped that such troubles will be obviated in the future and vessels be able to proceed to Bea regularly and according to programme.    This arrangement has been rendered more necessary in view of the fact that three other large vessels are to be engined at Padstow as soon as engines are obtainable.Fish Food Section.?^i^l^MMM*    It is proposed to proceed with the erection of tanksi*a&apos;t&quot;Teigmacuth immediately on the granting of the Regulation under the Defence of the Realm Act for which the Board are applying, and in anticipation of this an Engineer has been consulted who will at once proceed to Conway to inspect the installation there, as a precedent.    He will then go to Teignmouth to inspect suitable sites for the Tanks.SujDnli.es.    A further requirement of the trade is old&apos; sacking as covers for herring barrels.    A supply has been found through the Salvage Department, and if suitable in material and price, sufficient for the purpose will be available.-    A trial consignment&apos;has been ordered.Largo numbers of applications for assistance in procuring supplies of various kinds required by the Trade have been dealt with.

Energetic efforts aro being made to enrol in Section Y of the R.N.V.R, or failing this in tho Special Pithing Reserve P. 125, fishermen of the new military age.Fishermen. Pish Trade and Military Service.    Particulars have been received from&quot;the&quot; TlawonaT Men, Poultry, Game and Rabbit Trades&apos; Association, of the constitution of the Advisory Committees set up by that Association, and of the areas with which they are to deal.    The Association has also communicated their conclusions as to the advioe to be given to these Committees with a view to securing Uniform treatment of man-power questions throughout the country and of adapting the personnel which they attempt to retain to the actual needs of the locality and to the exigencies of the situation.    Hr. Maurice at a general meeting of this association took the occasion of urging the great importance of working towards an organised fish trade in all its branches, and of regarding all man-power questions not merely from the point of view of private interests but rather in the first instance from one of national interests, and requirements.    The Section has lost m opportunity of impressing on the Officers of the Association the National Importance of these viaws and their necessity as a condition of the Board1s support.The National Service Ministry have concurred in the ; Board&apos;s approaohing the Ministry of Munitions with a view of facilitating the transfer to fishing of experienced fishermen at present at work in controlled establishments.fresh Water fttsh Section.
