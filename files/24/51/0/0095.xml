CAb/%;&apos;:\    WCgg ON A REQUEST MADE BY THE GREEK GOTONMENT FOR A LOANJ^/^cT 1 * J OF      million fro.nos TO ASSIST THE L^TEIOPMENT vP THE &apos; fc,,,        ... PIRAEUS - SALONIKA RAILWAY.1,      The railway line front PIRAEUS to SALONIKA via LARISSA and PLATI Is already of considerable value to the Allies in MACEDONIA for saving shipping and for relieving congestion at the port of SALONIKA *    It might in the future become of vital importancein the event of a retirement of the whole, or part, of the Allied forces on to a line of defence south of SALONIKA covering OLD GREECE *2.     Hitherto, largely owing to lack of efficient control, theline has been working considerably below its maximum capacity. To remedy this, the Greek Government was asked in January, 1918, to consent to an arrangement whereby the entire line from PIRAEUS to SALONIKA would be controlled by the Allied Railway Commission at SALONIKA? of which the British and French Direct-ors of Railways are members:   to render the proposal more acceptable to the Greek Government, they were to be asked to nominate a Greek representative to the above Commissions   This proposal was, however,, rejected by the Greek Government, on grounds of political amour propre and the old system still prevails,, according to which we and tho French control tho railway as far south as KATERINI, on the boundary of the war zone, while from KATERINI to PIRAEUS it is still under Greek control,3*      The Greek Government has now asked the Military and JLord Grrn-Iville 595.   Financial Inter-Allied Commissions at ATHENS to advance 21I? * 5 * 131(appendix    million francs towards the development of this line (including^ a. *) *&apos;402iU 0 million&apos;francs for the organisation of an allied base at0.0.5.18.Appendix    PIRAEUS).      The Interallied Commissions and His Majesty1 sel..) *Minister at ATHENS recommend that the request should be granted.    The latter points out that if we refuse to share the expense the whole sum will probably be provided by the.French
2. 247French Government, which will consequently obtain complete control of the railway both during and after the war* At the same time he suggests that we should impose the condition that one British railway expert be added to the &quot;Superior Direction of Transports&quot; which consists at present of two Greeks and one French officer, under the presidency of K, Venizolos.There is another important military consideration to be borne in mind.    We are developing a line of supply via ITEA .-. BRALO, joining the PIRAEUS * SALONIKA line at BRALO,     It is clear that any great development of PIRAEUS by the French may absorb the total capacity of the line northwards to SALONIKA, to the detriment of our line of supply via ITEA,    It is essential, therefore, that we should be represented on the &quot;Superior Direction of Transports&quot; which controls the line from BRALO to KATERINI.4.     Conclusions,I consider that the only satisfactory solution of the problem would be the control, by one Allied Commission, of the entire line from PIRAEUS to SALONIKA, and I suggest that advantage be taken of the present request by the Greek Govern^ ment for financial assistance to press for the adoption of this measure.    -Only as a last resouroe should we consent to share in the proposed loan on the present unsatisfactory basis of dual control - and in that case- we should Insist on a British Representative being appointed on the &quot;Superior Direction of Transports&quot;.The following appendices are attached ;**A, Lord Granvilie1s 395 -- 7,5.18 ,B.

APPENDIX   A   to 0.1/163/466.SECRET.PILES ONLY.DocypherLord Granville, (Athens), (? Kay 7th),D. 8-45 p,ra R.   8-00 a.mMay 7th, 1918. May 8th, 1918*NO.395.received M.I.1,Confidential.Your telegram No.357 of April 20th.Greek Government have submitted to military and Finanoial Commission urgent request for 21 million francs to finance improvements, upkeep etc. of railway with construction of large clearing station at.Piraeus which they calculate will be used in equal proportions for civilian requirements, Greek military requirements and Allied military requirements.Commission agree that money is urgently required and that object is of great importance, particularly If, as they are told here, both French and British Armies propose to use Piraeus as a base of supplies but they also agree that the sum. required cannot come out of 750 millions under agreement as it stands.    French financial Delegate proposed neverthe-les3 that the three Allied Governments should be asked to allow advance out of 750 millions and Mr.Billinski agreed, with proviso that expenditure must in that case be closely followed, like all other expenditure under the agreement.   United States Delegate concurred and it was decided to recommend proposal in that form to three Governments9-Hints have been given that failing Governments consent to this course money required could probably be found in France which in my opinion and that of General Reade and Mr. Billinski would certainly entail complete French control of railway now and in the future.    We therefore urge the acceptance of proposal but suggest condition be imposed that one British railway expert be added to superior direction of transports which consists at present of two Greeks and one French Officer under presidency of Mr.Venezelos*: immediate management of line under superior direction being in the hands of two Frenchmen.,    Further condition should be that one British, one French^- one American and one Greek should be appointed as practical clerks of the ,works to control expenditure,     Of these one,should be a railway accountant and one a civilian engineer and it would be best that British representative should be accountant.Greeks would certainly not consent to put their line (? under) Salonika Committee (see my Despatch No,53 of February 23rd) and wc think aboire arrangement ought to work satisfactorily..    Greeks are not likely to accept it very easily as it savours strongly of their- bugbear   control&quot; andif
if you approve I would propose to speak privately to Mr.Venezjelos and point out to..him that we obviously cannot give money without Insisting on carefully &quot;following&quot; its expenditure,- that, if this arrangement is refused, the money will probably have, to be found in  Yance with certain control if not mortgage and that mixed&apos; control is surely better from his point of view than solo French control.I learn now that official demand for use of Piraeus by Allies-has not yet been made and I am asking General Milne whether, it is roally the intention.     If Piraeus clearing station were not considered necessary sortie eight million would bo saved but arguments regarding dangers of complete French control appears to me to apply in any case.General Reade asks that this telegram be communicated to War Office.Addressed to Foreign Office No. 395, repeated to General Officer Commanding, Salonika9

Lord Granyille (Athens), i.iay 10th, 1918.I).   3 p.rn, Hay 10th, 1918.R.   9.15 a.nu/  Hay 11th, 1918.No. 402 A *My telegram No,-395 of Hay 7th.   (Appendix *A 1)..Military and Financial Inter Allied Comissions having asked for documents showing on what Greek Government based state-merit that Piraeus was to be base for Allied, armies and therefore groat railway expenditure was needed for urgent military reasons * M. Venizelos sent message to them to-day that any documents they wished would be placed at their disposal but that if they refused loan, responsibility for any future want of transport for military obligations must rest with thorn and not with Greek Government *Some of works proposed of a permanent nature will be suitable for peace and whole scheme is drawn upon general lines to this end. Perhaps this is wise strategy in the long rim.   (V But also) parts of work such as permanent way etc. are urgently required for military and other purposes.     It is difficult here to ascertain what military policy is to be.    Though Greeks say Piraeus is to be base for.Allied armies General Officer-Commanding Salonika says he knows nothing of It.    General Guillaumat wrote April 12th to Chief of French Mission at &quot;Athens that from next September there will be much railway traffic for goods etc a from France and that Piraeus appears suitable port and their Idea is to have a base there - to this end Greek Government are to be approached.aa to choice of necessary quays and sites near them.    Again French President of the Council wrote April 26th to French Military Attache at Rome that line of communication (? Italy), Piraeus, Salonika was important and that arrangements should be made so that by the end of July 30,000 tons (? a month) could be carried throughout *It is probable that full policy on these points is known to War Office,No (? estimate) for additional rolling stock is included.Greek Government say they suppose French Commander^in^Chief is responsible for this.    At the same time as project is to Include capacity of line to 18 trains a day It is evident large amount of extra rolling stock will be required.Even if development of line is not regarded as wholly for military purposes I venture to remind you of arguments in my telegram       395 against giving French sole control.Please communicate this telegram to War Office and Treasury. Addressed to Foreign Office No. 4052, repeated to General Officer C ommand1ng, Salonika.
