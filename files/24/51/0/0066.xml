SUMMARY OF INFORMATION 1 f) 0545/35 G.British front.In accordance with a request from General Guillaumat, local operations were carried out during the month on tho STRUMA and DO IRAN fronts.     Those operations were designed to harass the enemy, disturb his projects and to obtain for us reliable information as to his intentions *During tho night of 14th/l5th April strong detachments from the 1st Greek Division and the 27th and 28th British Divisions pushed forward to occupy the following villages in the STRUMA Valley - BEGLIK MAHALE - KAKARASKA - SALMAEALI - ADA -KISPEKI - HOMONDOS - KALENDRA - TOPALOVA * PROSENIK and KJUPRI, while a proportion of the artillery took up positions on the left bank of the STRUMA.     The named villages were occupied with only slight casualties.For the first phase of the operations, until the enemy had discovered our new positions,, the advanced troops were disposed, in ambush with a view to capturing enemy patrols.At 0530 hours a Bulgar patrol about 30 strong was engaged by one of our ambushes N. of KALENDRA, four Bulgars being killed and four captured.At PROSENIK, the presence of our troops was apparently detected and the village was heavily shelled during the morning. In the course of the day parties of the enemy from 250 to 400 strong collected in the EAST BELICA STREAM where they wore engaged by our artillery and aeroplanes.Two companies of the 4th Rifle Brigade had occupied tho village and one of them was overwhelmed by a Bulgar attack which developed during the afternoon.     The enemy brought a machine gun into action from a commanding position on the rear of this company, and after a desperate fight both Companies withdrew to TOPALOVA having had 121 casualties.In the meantime two detachments from the 28th Division crossed the STRUMA by ARTILLERY BRIDGE and KOPRIVA BRIDGE and proceeded to ORMANLI and ELISAN respectively.     The first detach-ment on arrival at ORMANLI pushed forward reconnoitring patrols which encountered strong enemy parties in GIPSY village and DO LAP WOOD.     After a short encounter they withdrew to the main body.The other detachment after occupying ELISAN advanced to KJJMLl and KJUPRI.   Shortly after dawn the enemy commenced, sniping the patrol in the latter village together with short bursts of artillery fire*    About 0820 hours the fire increased and the en^my appeared in force (about 500) from E. N. &amp; W, at close range. .In spite of rapid fire from our patrol, the enemy advanced and rushed the three forward posts.     The patrol withdrew fighting at close range and inflicted considerable casualties on tho enemy. The open ground S. of KJUPRI afforded no positions for checking the enemy, and heavy rifle and artillery fire compelled a with-orawal to KUMLI.     Our casualties were about 50, thoso of the enemy being estimated at slightly more.No further operations beyond small patrol encounters and intermittent artillery fire took place on this front till the aight of the 18th/l9th April when our detachments withdrew totheir/
their original line unmolested?. The detachments of the Greek Division did not withdraw till the evening of the 20th/21st. As a result of these operations we have been enabled to verify the order of battle of the enemy along the entire STRUMA front.

On the DOIRAN - VARDAR front harassing operations have been confined to intermittent bombardments and wire cutting by our artillery, and small raids on enemy works. During the night of the 15th//16th April a raid was made on DOIRAN Town by a party of 5 officers, 9 naval ratings and 25 other ranks with the object of killing or capturing any of the eneny along the Lake road.

The party left DOIRAN Station in 4 boats at 0030 hours and landed at DOIRAN at 0205 hours undefeated by the enemy. The detachment after posting sentries on either flank to guard the boats, proceeded to search the town; but no enemy were encountered. In spite of a bright moon and Ve?y lights being fired the party were able to embark and return to DOIRAN station, where they arrived at O4OO hours without. It is believed, being observed by the enemy.

I consider the success with which the party managed to cross the lake, to land, and apparently to withdraw without detection, as largely due to the trouble taken by the Royal Navy in training the men.

On the morning of the 20th one of our raiding parties out the wire and entered the enemy trenches on PETIT COURONNE.

Occupied dugouts were bombed and two unwounded Bulgars were captured. Our party then withdrew with no casualties.

Other raids have been carried out on enemy works from 0.1, to 0.6 and on CHAPEAU de GENDARME but without incident.

Casualties have, in each case, been inflicted on the enemy, at small cost to ourselves.

Aviation.

Fine weather during the month has favoured aerial operations, hardly a day passing without our aeroplanes bombing enemy camps, ?mps, railway centres and communications.

On April 13th 21 of our aeroplanes bombed HUDOVA aerodrome. Bombs were observed to drop in and around the target. Two enemy scouts? which attacked our formation were driven down and crashed near CESTOVO.

Dumps at CESTOVO, PLATANENWALD, RUPEL, and KAKARA have also been bombed. The railway station at ANGISTA was attacked, a train as derailed, and several, trucks set on fire. Our aeroplanes then descended and fired on the enemy with their machine guns. During the period under review six enemy aeroplanes have been driven down, and over 14 tons of bombs dropped on objectives.

Allied Fronts.

Frequent raids have been carried out by our allies with satisfactory results, prisoners being taken and heavy casualties inflicted on the enemy.

At 0730 hours on 19th April after a bombardment lasting half an hour Serbian assault detachments of the 115th Regiment attacked the advanced trenches of the enemy south and south west of SBORSKO. They cut the wire, entered the trenches and drove back the enemy. Hostile reinforcements which were hurried up from the rear, as well the  retiring garrison of the trenches, were caught under the barrage and suffered heavily. Under cover of this baragge the Serbs were able
were able to hold on to the capt tared posts and then, profiting by a fog, wore enabled to withdraw to their own lines at 1300 , hours with comparatively few losses.At 0250 hours on 20th April Serbian detachments carried out a &quot;coup de main&quot;- against the enemy&apos;o trench system situated on the Eastern slopes of O0LA ROUT)Ir:A, capturing about 120 metres of trench.     This they successfully consolidated and held against violent counter-attacks of the enemy.       A certain amount of material was captured and heavy casualties inflicted on the enemy.On the raornlng  3rd April a French detachment consisting of the 58th 3n, Chasseurs a Pied, dismounted Spahis, elements of Albanian Gendarmerie, and two mountain batteries, carried out a reconnaissance 11, of the River PEV0LI with the object of obtaining information concerning Austrian Units,They advanced in S columns under cover of a thick mist at 0450 hours. .. At 0625 hours fighting took place when the right column, consisting of the 53th Chassuers a Pied, carried the ridge West of the River VRBA. (a tributary of the DEV0LI), and seized the village of SALS.     At 0850 hours the left column (Spahis Maroccains) entered STRELCA SID and continued their attacks against STRELGA KORB which fell into their hands at 1140 hours.   As it was not intended to hold any of these places the French withdrew at night bringing with them a certain amount of material and 9 Austrian prisoners.Other minor raids have been carried out by the French and Italians.Health of Troops.1.
