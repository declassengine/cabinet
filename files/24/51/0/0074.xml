187Printed Joy the War Cabinet.  May 1918.SECRET.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 51.Week ended 11th May, 1918,NAVAL OPERATIONS.Mines have been laid in the Heligoland Bight and in the northern approach to the North Sea, Thames.On 10th May one of our large America seaplanes from Killingholme, when on patrol off Borkum Reef, sighted a Zeppelin at an altitude of 8,000 feet. The Zeppelin rose to 10,000 feet, when the seaplane fired 120 rounds from a position 2,000 feet below the airship, and 60 rounds were also fired with the rear gun, some hits being observed.The Zeppelin then rose to 14,000 feet, followed by our seaplane, which opened fire again from 11,000 feet, when it was observed that material was being thrown from the airship. The attack was continued until a position 70 miles N.W. of Heligoland was reached, at which point, when the action had lasted over half an hour, the seaplane had to discontinue the engagement and alight, owing to the breaking of the oil pipe. Some enemy destroyers opened anti-aircraft fire, but without result, and the seaplane, after effecting temporary repairs, returned safely.Mines have been laid off the Belgian coast. Flandersarea.On 10th May, at 2 a.m., the attempt to block Ostend was repeated, the intention being for H.M.S. &quot; Vindictive,&quot; which was filled with concrete, to be sunk between the piers and across the entrance of the harbour.The Flotilla Leader &quot; Warwick &quot; (flag of the Vice-Admiral) and a division of destroyers sailed as a supporting force. When the force started on 9th May, the weather conditions were very suitable, but 15 minutes before arrival at Ostend thick fog set in. &quot; Vindictive,&quot; therefore, had difficulty in finding the harbour, and for 20 minutes cruised East and West seeking its entrance, during which time she was hit repeatedly.When the piers were sighted &quot; Vindictive &quot; was almost alongside; course was set for the entrance and &apos;she passed in under a very heavy fire from both guns and machine guns. On reaching a point about 150-200 yards from the entrance, the stem of &quot; Vindictive &quot; was placed against the Eastern Pier and the vessel was swung across the channel, but as it was then found that the vessel was aground and would not turn any further, she was sunk, and lies at an angle of about 40o to the pier, leaving 60 to 80 yards of fairway unobstructed.Her crew was taken off by Motor Launches 254 and 276 under very heavy machine gun fire, and it was during this work of rescue that most of the casualties occurred. The retirement commenced about 2.30 a.m., and at 3.35 a.m. &quot; Warwick &quot; picked up Motor Launch 254 in a sinking condition, and removed her crew and the survivors of&quot; Vindictive,&quot; subsequently blowing up the motor launch to ensure her not falling into enemy hands. &quot; Warwick,&quot; on the return journey, struck a mine and sustained damage aft, but was towed to Dover in safety.(C 1157)  Wt.     55  5/18  H k S
Aircraft from Dunkirk co-operated, six 550-lb., fifty-three 112-lb., and twenty-one 25-lb. bombs being dropped over Ostend docks.The total British casualties during the operation were : KilledMissingWoundedOfficers. 2 2 5Men. 6 926941R.A.F. machines from Dunkirk, employed on Naval duty, have also carried out a number of patrols and reconnaissances.On 8th May, five of our machines engaged 12 of the enemy, of which two crashed into the sea, one was driven down in flames, and another driven down out of control.During bombing raids on Zeebrugge and Ostend twenty-three 230-lb. and eighty-eight 25-lb. bombs were dropped in the vicinity of salvage ships at Zeebrugge Mole, and sixteen 25-lb. bombs on Ostend docks. Our airmen reported considerable activity around the block-ships.All our machines returned safely on this day.On 9th May 600 lbs. of bombs were dropped on Bruges, and nearly two tons of bombs on Zeebrugge, with good results. One enemy machine was driven down in flames, but all our machines returned safely.On 11th May two enemy aircraft were destroyed, and eight 250-lb. bombs were dropped on Zeebrugge, with the lock gates and a salvage ship as the objectives, and forty 25-lb. bombs on Bruges dock, but the results could not be observed. One of our machines is missing.A report has been received from the Coast Guard, Ballintrae (north coast of Ireland), that on 5th May a submarine fired 11 shells at the town, without, however, doing any damage, as they all burst in fields.On 6th May an air reconnaissance was made over Constantinople when it was seen that &quot; Goeben &quot; had left Stenia Bay, where she had been moored since the end of January.On 8th May our machines operating from Thasos bombed Drama aerodrome, one hangar being hit.   All our machines returned safely.On 11th May six of our machines carried out a bombing attack on Cattaro. Two direct hits on the floating dock and arsenal were observed, and the attack on submarines and destroyers apparently had good results. One enemy machine was driven down into the sea. One of our machines, the crew of which had received instructions to burn their machine should circumstances render such a course necessary, was obliged to land at Zukovac Point, 8 miles from Teodo.On 5th May, at 4.40 p.m., the sloop &quot; Rhododendron &quot; was torpedoed by a submarine 25 miles N. 30o Kfrom Westray (Orkneys), and her stern was blown off. After unsuc-cessful efforts had been made by trawlers to salve her, she sank at 10 a.m. the following morning.   Two officers and 13 men were lost.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines During the week under review it is estimated that about 16 large enemy submarines operating, have been operating, three being vessels of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type, working in the neighbourhood of the Azores and one of the three being outward bound. The remaining large boats have been operating chiefly in the Irish Sea and to the south of Ireland, and the Yorkshire coast has again been visited by one or more submarines. There was an entire absence of activity in the English Channel.The number of attacks on enemy submarines reported this week is unusually high.
The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Home Actions Waters during recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have been engaged, and ^j^rin^ also the number of submarines destroyed: 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		April 20th.

The percentage of losses to sailings in Overseas trades was 1 * 05 as against 3-16 the previous week, in Cross-Channel trades -08 as against 1-00, and in Coasting trades -13 as against no losses last week, while as regards all United Kingdom trades the percentage is - 50 as against 1 * 43 the previous week.(C 1157) A 2
Areas in which vessels lost.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign as well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine, classified according to areas.There has been a marked reduction in enemy activity during the week in almost every area, and it is noteworthy that the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay were entirely immune, and that no attack by a submarine has been reported in the whole of the area extending from the Straits of Dover to the Straits of Gibraltar.Attacks in April on vessels en-gaged in United Kingdom Overseas Trades.The total number of vessels of all nationalities which sailed to and from the United Kingdom in Overseas trades in the month of April was 1,974, and of these, 1,772 sailed in convoy and 202 independently of convoy. Twenty attacks were made on the 202 non-convoyed vessels, whilst of the 1,772 convoyed vessels 25 were attacked whilst in convoy and 22 before joining or after dispersal.In March, when the number of convoyed vessels was larger, only 17 such vessels were attacked whilst actually in convoy, and a considerably larger proportion of the attacks were made on non-convoyed vessels.Enemy Attacks in April classified.The total number of enemy attacks made upon steamships of all nationalities of over 500 tons gross during the month of April was 160 as against 213 in March and 156 in February, and the following table shows the method and result of such attacks and classifies the vessels as to whether in convoy or not at the time of attack : Method and Result of Attack.

The mining of the approaches to Dover synchronised with the opera-tions off Ostend, and may possibly have been undertaken with the intention of intercepting our ships on their return.It is now definitely established that mines have recently been laid off Sierra Leone, this being the first instance of submarine minelaying so far afield as the West Coast of Africa. One mine was cut by a merchant steamer&apos;s Otter and one swept up by mine-sweepers, and from the description received, it appears that these mines are similar to our new submarine type and capable of being fired from torpedo tubes. They could therefore be carried by any type of submarine with the sacrifice of a certain number of torpedoes, and it is estimated that for every torpedo dispensed with two of the mines could be stowed.The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels Casualties, sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks : Week Ended.

No enemy ships have entered or left Rotterdam.The movements of enemy merchant ships this week shew a marked reduction, the average number for the past nine weeks having been 25.
FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.The Germans are now pressing the Russians to enforce our withdrawal from Murmansk, and threaten to enter Petrograd unless action is taken. The Central Soviet does not desire to see any retirement on our part, but it feels helpless to withstand the German threat in view of the military situation in Russia.A small force of White Guard Finns is now close to Pechenga and is apparently the advanced party of a force of some 500 men which is said to be moving north towards that place. Meanwhile it is reported from Helsingfors that an order has been given that all operations towards Murmansk and Karelia are to cease forthwith. This order may be due to the differences which are stated to have arisen between General Mannerheim and the German authorities in Finland.General Ogorodnikov has now been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the White Sea region. He is said to speak English well, to be a favourite in Archangel, and to be most sympathetic towards the Allies. He has been granted full powers by Trotsky to arrange locally with the Allied representatives the desired exchange of stores for the cargoes of the food ships.The evacuation of material from Petrograd is now believed to be proceeding by both water and rail, and British and French officers have been called in to control the transport.Regular sailings are now reported to have commenced between Abo and Liibeck. Certain Russian shipowners at Libau, Riga and Revel have approached the German Baltic Shipping League with a proposal for obtaining redelivery of their ships from the Russian Government and they have been promised assistance, provided that the ship-owners will accept German nationality and place their ships under the German flag. Commander Leighton is leaving England for Petrograd at once to keep an eye on these transactions.Sevastopol was occupied by the Germans on May 4th. On May 1st the 2 Russian Dreadnought battleships, 2 of the cruisers and several destroyers, escaped to Novorossisk, but the 7 pre-Dreadnought battleships, the other 2 cruisers, 8 destroyers, 14 submarines and some auxiliaries remained at Sevastopol and fell into enemy hands.The Turkish Minister of Marine has given orders that the captured cruiser &quot; Prut&quot;  originally the Turkish &quot; Medjidieh &quot; and the destroyers and submarines are to be removed to Constantinople as soon as possible. After the fall of Sevastopol, Theodosia and the remaining ports in the Crimea were soon capturecl.Reports have been, received that Novorossisk is to be attacked by land from Kertch, assisted by &quot; Goeben &quot; and any other naval forces available.The Germans are said to be looking for a suitable harbour in the region of Lake Sasik, north of Sulima, to be converted into a naval base and mercantile harbour which, being north of the Danube, would strategically be superior to Constanza.Italy.On April 29th an enemy submarine bombarded the W/T Station on Cape Sperone, Sardinia.  The aerial was brought down, but otherwise thedamage wras slight.Spain.The Germans are constantly imposing fresh conditions on the Spanish vessels to which they grant safe conducts. In particular they have recently decided that they will no longer grant safe conducts to vessels which refuse to carry goods for firms appearing on the Allied Black List.The Spanish Government have now determined to requisition the entire merchant fleet of Spain, owing, probably to the critical position as regards food supply, and also because shipowners have become timid and many sailings have been suspended in con-. sequence of the large number of Spanish vessels which have been sunk.Naval Staff,16th May, 1918.[Appendices.
