WaR  CABINETColonel I, Dally toes.EEBEHaLISM .I hope I&quot;.may be pardoned if I refer very brieflyto my own position as regards the Federal system.    I haveon the ground mainly that the country is geographically too small for more than one Parliament.     The scheme that I preferred for devolution involved granting further powers to County Councils, grouping County Councils in certain areas, and setting up therein a central representative Council of the area, empowered to levy taxation within certain defined limits, and to pass legislation dealing with specific subjects, and I suggested that the Imperial Parliament at Westminster should have the seme control over their procedure, or at all events, a somewhat similar control to that possessed by the Dominion Parliament&apos; of Canada over the Provincial Parliaments.     I still believe that if this reform had been adopted twenty years ago, it would have avoided the necessity for Home Rule in any form, but I realise,, as I think everybody must do, that events have marched far too rapidly recently to offer the least prospect of such a proposal finding favour anywhere to-day. And therefore it appears to me that Federalism is the only way in which the pressure on Parliament can be relieved.before I realised that we must find some way cf dealing with the vast amount of business involving legislation which we must ask Parliament to pass if we are to take full advantage of the less^ons we have learned in the War, and make the Empire really self-supporting and able to defend herself against the world, whether in arms or in trade.     I was very greatly impressed by many conversationsalways been opposed to Federalism for the United KingdomI had not been many months in the Colonial Officethat
that I had with sober-minded, experienced representatives of our Dominions.    What they said may I think be not inaccurately described as follows -We, in cur Dominions, are devoted to the Crown and the Flag;   we believe in the Empire, and subject to certain conditions, we are very anxious to see it brought closely together and made stronger and self-supporting.    As we watch politics in the Mother-Country, we find ourselves in agreement with those who hold Unionist views on Imperial questions, and when we come here, we expect and hope to find them devoting themselves to the solution of these great problems.     But we find to our dismay that their time end thoughts are taken up in dealing with a variety of domestic questions, some of which we cannot in our newer countries even understand. . We find Parliament engaged upon what we would regard as parochial iegis-lation to the entire exclusion of the greater questions which affect us so closely, and it makes us despair of the future of the Empire.    We are compelled to con-sider our own position.     There is no fear that we shall ever desert the Crown or the Flag, but we want   . to go further than this.    We want to act hand&apos; in hand with the Mother-Country in certain questions and on certain lines, and if we are forced to the conviction that there is no prospect of the Imperial Parliament finding time to deal with these matters, we shall then be compelled,, very much against our will, to strike out on a line of our own, and to embark upon a programmewhich
notwhich otherwise we Bhould/*dopt..Conversations of this character deeply impressed me. There was no doubt about tho sincerity of the speakers. They were indeed pathetic in their anxiety that we should work together - the Mother Country and the Dominions -and in their despair when they realised how fully our time is taken up with minor questions.     Bo much for my personal experiences.When it became my business to consider the questions which press for settlement as soon as the War is over, and which affect the whole Empire, questions connected with Foreign Affairs, Defence, Finance, Trade, Communica-tions c.o. - I need not I am sure, enumerate them all here - I realised that there is enough work before us to occupy the time of Parliament for a very long time before we can dispose of the accumulation, and it seems to. me that with each successive year old problems will change, new problems will arise, and an Empire Parliament will have all its time occupied with dealing with Empire questions, and I might here point out that many of those who at present are the strongest opponents of Federalism are to be found among those who have made the loudest complaints in previous times of the ill-proportioned view taken by the British peoples of matters of vital nationa,l importance.    We have constantly been told -and with a very great deal of truth - that some rela-tively unimportant matter of domestic interest or pre-judice which happened to excite the popular fancy of the moment, would overlay and obscure the higher Imperial issues at an Election, and this must always so remain solong
long as these minor issues of purely domestic importance continue to be dealt with by the Imperial Parliament.And it is not only in respect of natters of Imperial Government that there is congestion,    The same holds good of domestic government.   I find legislation is re-quired dealing with a variety of subjects, such as Local Government, Public Health, Education, Licensing, Highway Administration, and a variety of other local questions. I find that the laws and customs of the three countries &apos; of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and in a lesser but still in a material degree, of Wales, differ so complete-ly the one from the other, that it is almost hopeless to attempt to deal with questions of this kind in one Bill, and that we are therefore forced to contemplate the introduction of legislation for each country,   There is also the financial aspect of this subject.     Ever since the Act of &apos; 68, when the Local Government Bill was passed, and Scotland and Ireland demanded grants similar to that given to Great Britain in relief of local taxa-tion, it has been the invariable rule and practice, when money is granted to England for a particular purpose, to give the equivalent to Scotland and Ireland, even though, as has more than once been the case, they have no immediate purpose to which they desire to devote the grant.     In these circumstances I have come deliberately to the conclusion that if we are really to do for the Empire what she needs, and at the same time to meet the legitimate requirements of our people at home, the only possible way in which this huge task can be accom-plished, is by a system of devolution to local Legislatures, and if I had. my way, I would decide that the Federal system must be adopted, and I would makethis
this declaration when &quot;bringing in the Irish Bill.If I may turn from the Imperial and general domestic questions to the particular one of a Parliament for Ireland, I cannot exsggerate the importance to be at-tached to the adoption of the Federal plan.   It must attract the attention, and I think receive the support of all our Dominions, aid of the United States of America.     It would undoubtedly materially alter the position of Ulster.     It would no longer be possible for her people to say that they demand but are not going to receive similar treatment with the rest of the United Kingdom.    I am of course aware of the argument that this is a vast constitutional change, and ought not to be contemplated during the War, but will this argument really hold good?     We have dealt with one of the great-est of our social questions, Parliamentary reform, and I think it is not Incorrect to say that our action has been very generally approved.    We are legislating every day in connection with many of our most contentious questions, and if it is legitimate to do these things during war, can it really be justly held that we are to be forbidden to make an attempt to solve a problem the reality of which no man can doubt, and if in this solution of the general problem we find an easier path for very many of our friends in the United Kingdom in connection with Irish self-government, is not the ad-vantage so great that we ought to make up our minds and adopt the plan which I venture to advocate?So far as my information goes, a considerable majority in the present House of Commons, includingLabour,
Labour, would support this proposal.   The opponents I hear, are- steadily decreasing in number, and yet the advantages which I have tried, most inadequately I know, to set out here, have never been explained to them,   I venture to say with great respect, that it is, in my judgment, almost an obligation upon Unionist Members of the Government to make it as easy as is possible for those who have hitherto always opposed Home Rule, to support the Government policy.    To set up a parliament in Dublin apart from the Federal system is to be confronted at once with the problem which has defeated statesman after statesman, namely, what is to be the position of the Irish Members in the Parliament of the United Kingdom?   Once the Federal plan is adopted this difficulty disappears.   Then as regards Customs and Excise, it is contended in some quarters that control of these shall be given to Ireland..So long as they are fighting their own battle alone,   , they are able to advance their demands with considerable effect, but although I am not foolish enough to imagine that any plan whj.cn we adopt would put an end to their claims, yet it is surely obvious that once we decide to apply the system to the United Kingdom, their decision must be very greatly weakened.   What I would like to do would be to make the Irish Bill, not merely as it is noW? consistent with the Federal plan, but actually in -words a part of a Federal plan.   I would like to set up English, Scottish, and Welsh Committees, not to enquire into Federalism, this would be fatal in my judgment, but to prepare the particular constitutional systems suited to their various ideas and respective countries; for the powers which the.subordinate legislatures areto
to exercise will have bean settled by the Government of Ireland Act.   They will be the same for England, Scotland and Wales as they are for Ireland,     I believe that wall-selected Committees would do this work with   very great celerity and without any serious difficulty, and I can-not help thinking that even those who are most doubtful about Federalism to-day would welcome &quot;the change when they found that by it it became possible to meet our Imperial obligations, and at the same time satisfy the just demands of our people at home,W.H.L&apos;9th ]fey, 1918.COLONIAL OFFICEc
