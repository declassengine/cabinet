^ J&amp;ujk* 6 9* JThfs Document is the Property of&apos;/ His Britannic tVfajestVs Government)*:MiIitary Secret.5^ u/^//vP i%^HAIL From Viceroy, Home Department, 1st May 1018.(Received India Office 10 p.ni.)Delhi Conference. Opened Saturday 27th by Viceroy and attended by sixteen Princes, non-official members of Legislative Council, and about one hundred representatives selected by Provinces from all shades of political opinion. Considerable feeling- amongst small. Home Pule section of politicians at non-inclusion among provincial delegates of Til ale and Mrs. Besaut resulted in strong disposition on the part of certain, delegates to insist on importation of political considerations into any resolutions passed, though great majority fully realised that at present juncture such a procedure would be most undesirable.. This rendered it inexpedient to move definite resolution for abatement of political propaganda. Two sub-eom-mittees formed to consider man-power and material resources respectively reported, the former committee in favour of (1) continuance of energetic recruitment upon voluntary basis ; (II) early consideration by Government of substantial increase of sepoys&apos; pay ; (III) early and generous admission of Indians to Xing&apos;s Commissions as calculated to afford great stimulus lo &quot; .. response ; and (IV) formation of publicity and employment bureaux; the latter Committee in favour of immediate constitution of Provincial Com-mittees to include non-officials to co-operate with Munitions Hoard and other authorities established and to be established for economy of railway tradic, encouragement of consumption locally of local products, control generally of supplies, immediate development of programme for construction of shipping, development of production of foodstuffs and war requirements, and urging economy on the part of Government and public in use of materials.A resolution advocating abolition of all racial distinct ions and introduction of a Bill into Parliament for establishment of responsible Government in India within a reasonable Bpecilied period was ruled out of order on Monday by Viceroy, when reports of sub-committees were adopted with suitable resolutions. Speaking&quot; generally, and after making all allowance for ill-considered and short-sighted attitude adopted by afore-mentioned section, Conference was successful. The object of Conference, which was to enlighten India generally on situation and to enlist co-operation of prominent men in measures necessary, was, we believe, achieved. The Conference could &apos;not go closely into details, or undertake spade work, but policy was formulated of expansion of present efforts to be worked out by Provinces under guidance of Central Government. Conference showed existence of large measure of appreciation of situation and cordial desire to furnish further assistance to cause of Empire, while measures advocated in resolutions will bring into being throughout India a greatly strengthened and improved machinery both for educating people as to needs and obligations of situation and for giving effect to necessary measures. It is hoped that, as a result measures for recruitment, half million recruits will be obtained during year, and necessary corollary will be further examination of question how best to apply our already greatly reduced European man-power. Pespouse of Chiefs with offers of assistance in men and money most cordial and generous.Will you use your discretion in communicating all or any of above to the Press.
