(This Document is the property of Q ,H,is Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)a.ECRMfraorai^Gm^for the War Cabinet by First Lord of the Mair&amp;lty -covering a Meirorahdum by Lord Pirrie &amp; Sir Almiinderaon.In forwarding to the V/ar Cabinet the enclosed memorandum an Shipyard Labour, which has been prepared by Lord Pirrie and Sir Alan Anderson in view of the forthcoming discussion of this subject by the War Cabinet, I desire to draw particular attention to the following facts:-In July 1917; the War Cabinet made a first priority allotment of labour, amounting1 %c SO,000 Ken, to shipbuilding, of which a minimum of 12,500 should be skilled.   Up to the 19th of April 1918, thisallotment has only been met, to the extent, of 32,000*In January, 1918, it was found that outside the servicestherewas a shortage of skilled and semi-skilled shipyard workers I The War Cabinet immediately decided that 20,000 skilled and semi-skilled men should be released from the Amy.   Up to the 19th of April, this allotment- has only been met to the extent of 6,000*These figures speak for themselves:    and whilst. I am fully aware of the very great difficulty/ of releasing men from the Army, even for shipyard work, at the present time, I think the following points cannot be too strongly emphasised:-(1) That the need of the Admiralty for shipyard labourhas ftn no way abated: indeed, the strain of repair work has doubled in recent months, at the expense of new construction*(2) That the supply of steel, is now in advance of thesupply of labours(3) That the dilution cannot be effected on a large scale,,until there is an adequate withdrawal of skilled and semi-skilled men from the Army.   The Employers and Trades Unions insist on this points(4). Not only has the realisation fallen seriously shortof the allotment of labour, but constant demands are being made upon the Admiralty to release men from the Yards for hilitary Service^.Finally, I would point out that the Prime Minister, when explain-ing to Ministers the proposals for raising men for the Army at the War Cabinet meeting on the 6th of April, stated in the most positive terms his view as to the vital necessity of shipbuilding.. The Prime Ministerrs words on that occasion, as quoted in the Minutes, were: -&quot;It is clear that certain industries must- not be touched: &quot;shipbuilding must on no account be interfered with - it &quot;must remain in the foremost position among protected &quot;industries, for without more ships, neither we nor our Allies &quot;can carry on the war&quot;*In the stress of the great battle, the comparatively small demand for labour for merchant shipbuilding is net, I think, seen in its right perspective.   Red herrings, such as dilution and release of men from the Navy, etc*, are drawn across the track.     To compare&quot;dilution&quot; on Admiralty work with &quot;dilution&quot; on Ministry of Munitions v;ork is useful and Interesting:but at best it can only be a slow process, and the immediate results will not be great.- Steps are, however, being taken to reorganise the Shipyard Labour Department with a view to extending dilution and effecting economy of skilled men, In this vital question of the nation&quot; s merchant tonnage,with the j charter given by the Cabinet for the priority for labour,confirmed by the Prime Minister in his words which I have quoted,we have since July 1917,received a net addition of 32,000 men out of 80,000 promised,This is the situation as regards shipyard, labour,which I would ask the Cabinet to face. 5.1918- (Signed) ERIC r^g.
WAR    CABINET.SKIHARp LABOURf SUPPLY AMD REGULATION.Memorandum by Lord Pirrie (Controiler General of Merchant Shipbuilding) and Sir AJ,an Anderson.With reference to M&amp;BsraQS&apos; Memorandum of the 26th April, 1918 (No0G.T\.4341)vaFl*baiB&apos;domestic arrangements in connection with the Admiralty Shipyard Labour Department have recently been under discussion and the advice of the Minister of Labour, Mr. Barnes and the Minister of National Service has been sought on the general lines of policy0 These general lines which are stated below have been approved but Mr. Barnes in&apos; his Memorandum of the 26th instant criticises certain points of the organisation which he believes the Admiralty propose to set up.(2) The shipbuilding employers and unions have recently expressed a strong desire to be allowed freedom to settle their own affairs direct without the intervention of any Government department *    Useful as some of the activities of the Shipyard LaBour Department undoubtedly have been... the Controller General and the Controller have come to the conclusion that the best results will be reached by acceding, so far as possible, to the de3ire of the industry to accept responsibility for the first handling of differences9    This is the policy the Admiralty adopts   The only change in organisation necessitated by this policy has already been made in the form of an instruction to the Shipyard Labour District Directors to abstain from inters ventioiXj unless desired to Intervene by the Controller General or the Controller as the case may be9(3) There appears, to,be nothing in this change which re-fuired previous assent of the Cabinet or now requires Cabinet consideration0    It is a policy which, as stated above, has been blessed by the three Ministers specially concerned in labour,    Quite apart from this change of policy, the advent of the Controller General and the departure of Sir Lynden Macassey to America makes it desirable to examine in some detail the activities of the S.LJ). both in the Districts and at the Centre,    This is being done, but any change that proves to be desirable and which may or may not require con-sipleratAon with other departments or with the Cabinet will not be ready for discussion until the results of the in-vestigation are known.It need scarcely be said that the Admiralty and Sir Robert Hofcne (Director of Materials and Priority) who has now assumed charge of fully appreciate the necessity of workingwith the other departments^, and of making no new arrangements in any way affecting them without the fullest consultation with them.(4) Dilution in shipbuilding must be effected by arrange-ments between the Unions and the EmployersB    The problem of the shipyards is essentially different from the problem of the machine shops where repetition prevails.    Some progress lias al-ready been made in diluting one set of Tradesmen with another,e.g./
ecg,, Shipwrights1, work is being done by Joiners, and Copper-smiths 1 work by Joiners and Fitters,    There are many obvious reasons why it is difficult to employ women in most of the branches of shipyard work;   but they are doing a certain amount of.fitting and general labouring work, 5,000 roughly being so employed,,    In marine engineering shops 5/6,000 women are engaged in preparing and fitting turbine blading, general fitting and labouring work.    The figures given are exclusive of women em-ployed on clerical and simi1ar^adminstrative duties0   In 1917* dilution was definitely stopped by the shortage of ste$l.  When material was the   neck of the bottle organised labour refused to admit the necessity to dilute their ranks,    When steel overtook labour in the autumn of 1917 an approach was made to the Govern-ment by the shipbuilding employers and Unions together to set free from the Army the skilled shipbuilding workers not employed there on their trade, before attempting to&quot; force newcomers - &quot; unskilled men at that, - into the industry0    On the 32nd January the Cabinet assented to this proposition and ordered the return&quot; of the skilled men6    The result of this order is shewn below(5) The present gives a convenient opportunity of in-forming the War Cabinet of the present position of shipbuilding lab our generally.(6) A Memoranda dated 5th July 1917 was submitted to the War Cabinet on the general situation of shipbuilding, shewing the steel and labour which would be required to give a certain output per annum0On the 10th July 1917, the War Cabinet made a first priority allotment of labour amounting to 80,000 men, of which a minimum of 12,500 should be skilled.The following table shews the extent to which this allot-ment has been met:-Allotment	RealisationCabinet Minute 10th July 1917....... 80,000 with a minimum of 12,500 skilled	32,000 from 31st July 1917 to 19th April 1918. JIt was subsequently found that outside the Services there was not available a sufficient supply of skilled andsemi-skilled shipyard workers.    &quot;The War Cabinet, therefore, decided on the 22nd January 1918 that 20,000 skilled and semi-skilled men should be released from the Army.    The War Cabinet further decided on the 19th March 1918 that certain skilled men should be released from the Navy and from the Air Force0    All these men to form part of the 80,000 originally allotted.     The following table shews to what extent these men have been released- :-

The tonnage of damaged vessels rescued during March was 50$ higher than any month since June 1917? and by far the largest month since the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfaree(8) The War Cabinet on the 23rd March 1918 ordered the release of 12,500 men from Admiralty  A* firms; it being understood that the Ministry of National Service would provide suitable substitutes.&apos; The following table shews the numbers released up to the 20th April 1918a    Any substitutes which may have been provided are included in the total figure under (6)  Number to be released	I----  -i :Mo, of Names handed in to Recruiting Officer whom he may call up.

(9) Government.an4 the Shipyards:   In the past the authority of the Government has been exercised In the shipyards by several departments,,    The Admiralty desire for the future that to each shipyard and marine engineering shop, one department alone should convey the instructions of the GovernmentbBy arrangement between the Controller-General and the Con-troiler, sanctioned by the Board of Admiralty, certain shipyards which are primarily engaged in merchant shipbuilding have been placed under the Controller-General, and other shipyards primarily Naval have been placed under the Controller,    A similar course will be followed in the case of Marine Engine Shops,AH Admiralty orders to merchant shipbuilding yards or engine shops will pass through the Controller-General, and all Admiralty orders to Naval shipyards or engine shops will pass through the Controllerc    The Admiralty urge that this principle should be extended to other departments of the Government, and . that when a Government Department, other than the Admiralty, has occasion &quot;to exercise Government authority in Admiralty *Ah Firms or upon the men employed therein, the authority should be exercised through the Dc.M?.?0&quot;of&quot; the Admiralty, and the Controller-General or the Controller., as the case may be0The Admiralty believe that much confusion and friction will be avoided by the adoption of this method0(Signed)   PIRRIE.11 A ,GC ANDERSON 030o4B18o
