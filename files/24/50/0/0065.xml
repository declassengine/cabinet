(Shis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty1s Government).T.WAR CABINET.EXTENSION OF TH5 BRITISH IlflE.Note by the Secretary, (with Summary).On WuB&amp; 8, 1917, General Sir Henry Wilson, Head of the Brit-ish Mission at French Genera! Headquarters, gave the War Cabinet a serious warning as to the state of the French Army, in the course of whioh he:-Expressed the view that before long the British Government would be approached by the French Government with a request to take over a further section of the line on the Western front.   A case based on a comparison of tho numbers of bayon-ets would be made out which it would be very difficult to re-sist.   General Maodonogh confirmed General Wilson&apos;s informa-tion that there was a strong feeling in France that we ought to hold more of the line.   On its being pointed out that to hold more of the line was not consistent with the active pro-secution of the offensive by the British Army, General Wil-son eaid that the French were good comrades, and,although they had not much confidence in our proposed autumn offensive, could be relied on to give us our chance and not to press us to extend our lines prematurely.    (War Cabinet 159A).On July 4, 1917, a most important telegram was received fromthe British Ambassador in Paris, recounting a visit he had hadfrom M. Abel Ferry, Deputy and Reporter of the Chamber Commissionof the Army, and on the outbreak of war Under-Secretary of Stateof the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.   The following is a paraphraseof an extract from this telegram:-&quot;After a preliminary statement of his strong sentiments for cordial cooperation between the British and French nations for many generations to come, he stated that he desired to ex-plain the attitude he had taken up in the Secret Sittings of the Chamber in his attacks on the Ministry.   He had pressei the Government to insist on an extension of the front hell by the British Army in order to avoid difficulties and disputes In the future between England and France.   As a Sub-hieuten-ant in command of 40 men, he had served at the front.   As Re-porter of the Army Commission ne had frequently visited the front.   He, therefore, knew the sentiments of the soldiers. He maintained that there is among French soldiers a feeling that they have borne much the harder part,nf and that a full share has not been taken by British troops in opposing the Germans.   In consequence, there was discontent and even cries for peace.   In order to put an end to this bitterness and feeling against England in the future it was essential that
the British front should be lengthened by 135 xilos. (85 miles) so as to maAe it up to its proper proportion to the French line, and to enable  Teach soldiers to have a time of rest during the winter in their turn, so that in the spring they may be ready for an offensive.   If this is not done there may be a disaster and an inconclusive peace.   He says that the density of British troops on the ground is double or treble that of the trench,    The Army Commission adopted his Report, and the speech he made in Secret Sitting in support of his proposals was received by a large majority with^acclam-ations, and they would be adopted in a public sitting,&quot;In regard to this:-&quot;The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he thought this would be required of us next winter, but he did not anti-eipate any definite request would be put forward by the French Government for action before that time..&quot; (Jar Cabinet 176, 6).An extract of M. Abel Ferry&apos;s Report was circulated by tho General Staff on the 11th July, 1917, with some remarxs, but does not seem to have been discussed at the War Cabinet. (W.P-41).Further information to tho same effect continued to be re-ceived, and on July 6, 1917, General Sir Henry Wilson-, on resigninghis appointment as Chief of the British Mission at ?rench GeneralHeadquarters, forwarded a Memorandum to the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, in which occurs the following:-&quot;In order to keep Prance as an active partner in the War until America can act in the field with real success, wc must treat her with great consideration.   We must be helpful in every sense of the word, and when she asks us later on to take over many miles of hef front, we must do so with as good a g^:&quot;ace&quot;&apos;as we can.   We must remember that in Prance we have found a real aTTy &quot;and a good comrade ever since this war began, and we must pay her bae&amp; in her own coin, but we must do more&quot; &amp;c., andand the Cabinet Committee on War Policy, in their Report dated Aug-ust 10, 1917, considered that tho Government1s war policy shouldbe based on the following assumption, among others:-&quot;It will be necessary before the winter to take over a considerable section of the line now held by the French.&quot;On September 21, 1917, Lord Derby:-&quot;Reported that,on his way to Italy, and also on his return, he had seen M* Painleve, who had raised once more the ques-tion of lengthening our lines.   Lord Derby had told him that the matter would receive attention, but tha-v no decision could be reached until this ycarrs operations were over.&quot; (?fer Cabinet 257, Minute 5).On September 25,.the question of our taking over more of theFrench line was formally raised by M. Painleve at &amp; Conference etBoulogne, attended, on behalf of the British Government, by Mr.LLoyd
George and General Sir William Robertson.   The Minutes of the shortdiscussion which arose are given in full below:-&quot;M, PAINLB7S said that tho question of the extension of the British line on the Western front was a vital question for France.   It was necessary to demobilise the men of 48 years of age in the French army in order to provide for the sgricul-tural needs of the country.   Otherwise the economic life of the country could not continue.GENERAL FOCH said that it was important that the line should be taken over by the 1st November.SEVERAL ROBERTSON said that the question must be regulated on the basis of next yearTs plans of operations.   The matter should, therefore, be left  or arrangement between IPield-M&amp;rshal Haig and General Petain as *oon as the offensive oper-ations now in progress come to an end.   5o far as the Govern-raents were concerned, the principle of taking over more of the line was already admitted.M, PAINLBVE pointed out that the question was not a purely military one, as its economic importance ?/as considerable.GENERAL ROBERTSON pointed out that in these respects, of course, General Petain would take his instructions from his Minister.G3N3R&amp;X FQCK insisted on the importance of keeping quite distinct the question of relieving the French lines and next yearJs plans,   the question of relief was one of great urgen-cy to France, in order, during the winter, to release the la-bouy essential for agriculture.    ?men the question of the spring offensive was decidedj the arrangement could be read-justed to meet the plan.GENERAL R0B3RTS0N pointed out that, in order to rest, and, more especially, to train, troops who s?ere to take part in an offensive, it was necessary to keep them out of the line. Consequently, any great extension of the British line was not consistent with the adoption of a great offensive next spring. More particularly, so long as the present offensive continued, it was impossible to take over more of the line, although the question could be discussed.GENSRiL FOGH insisted that the question of date was ona of urgency.   Operations such as the autumn ploughing and sow-ing could not wait.GENERAL R03SRTS0N proposed that he and the Prime Minister should discuss the question with i&quot;le Id-Marshal Haig, whom they were to see on the following day, and should ask him to place himself in cotssnunioation with General Petain.   It was not pos-sible to fix a date now.   He thought that he himself was look-ing for greater success from Ifi eld-Marshal HaigTs present op-era t ions than General Fooh,   3o long as the troops were fight-ing hard they were doing the best they could for the war,SSNSRAL POCK agreed that the question should be discussed, in the first instance, between Field-Marshal Haig and General Petain.&quot;The Conclusion was as follows&quot;The British ^vernment having accepted, in principle, the extension of&apos;the line held by the British Army on the West-em front, the two Governments are agreed that the question of the amount of the extension and the time at which it should take place should be left for arrangement between the two Commanders-in-Chief\3.
On tha same evening the Prime Minister and Sir William Robert-son proceeded to General Headquarters and informed Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig verbally of the decision taken that morning.This decision was reported to the War Cabinet by the Prime Minister on September 27, 1918 (War Cabinet g^Oc^nnteU).On the occasion of his visit to Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haigon September 25, the Prime Minister had asked verbally for a reportof the Field Marshall views as to the r6le of the British forcesin the event of Russia being unable to maintain an active part inthe war, and having regard to the weakened state of France and Italy.The Fiald-Marshales, in his Report, which was a very large ouq, dated8th October, 1917, favoured an offensive, provided certain condi-tions were fulfilled, among which he included the following:-&quot;It is of great importance that every possible facility shall be afforded for training my troops during the winter; and for sending as many officers and men as possible (subject to train-ing and defence requirements) on leave between the cessation of this offensive and the commencement of the next.   The armies have undergone almost superhuman exertion and hardships during the last few months, and unless the demands made on them dur-ing the winter are reduced to a minimum they cannot be expect-ed to respond fully to the further heavy calls entailed by a renewal of the offensive next year.    I urge this point very strongly and it entails resistance to any French demands on us to take over more line.   A refusal by us to do so will un-doubtedly be both justifiable and wise.   Though the French ean-not be expected to admit it officially, we know that thy state of their armies and of the reserve man-power behind the as-m-ics is such that neither the French Soverscent nor the niilit-ary authorities will venture to call on -heir troops for any further great and sustained offensive effort, at any rate be-fore it becomes evident that the enemy1s strength has been de-finitely and finally broken.   Though they are staunch in dc-fence and will carry out useful local offensives against lim-ited objectives the French armies would not respond to a call for more than that, and the authorities are well aware of it. In these circumstances, since the British armies alone can be made capable of a great offensive effort it is beyond argument that everything should be done by our allies  3 well as cur-selves to enable that effort to be made as strong as possible, and for this as much training, leave and rest as possible is absolutely essential for our men.&quot;The French authorities will no doubt insist strongly on an extension of our front, but the weight of argument is all against it and our troops are entitled to be protected against what is really an unfair demand on them.   They are in a foreign country, the French are at home.    They get little leave and at long intervals, the French soldiers get 10 days1 leave every 4 months and their Government dare not refuse it.   Our men have borne more and accomplished more than the French this sum-mer, and though France may plead that the weight of the war has fallen on her it cannot be expected that the British sold-iars in the field who have done so much and borne so much, and who have come voluntarily from the ends of the ear.a uo in France, will be content to see preferential treasong^-^ to our allies.    This aspect of the case must not oe overioo^u any more than the purely military arguments, and it is on
popular feeling amongst the French people rather th&amp;n on mil-itary argument that the French demand on us to taka over more line is based.&quot;(The actual extent of front measured by milos is no tost Of what we should hold.   The true test is the relative number of enemy divisions engaged by us and still more the r6le to be allotted to us in next year&apos;3 campaign. &quot;&apos;&quot;For all these reasons it is necessary in my opinion to re-fuee to take over more line and to adhere resolutely to that refusal, even to the point of answering threats by threats if neoess&amp;ry.&quot;   fG8Tu2?.45J.On October 10-, 1917:-WTHE PRIME MINISTER informed the War Cabinet that he bad seen II. Painleve the previous evening, and again in the mom-ing, and that the position was as iollowsT- M; Painleve&quot; was mainly oonoerned that the British Expeditionary i&apos;-ores should take over some of the line from the French., otherwise, the prospects in France would be extremely difficult.   Li\ PainlerS represented that the life of the French nation depended on the release from the Colours of some of the older men for the pur-pos^s of the hardest, otherwise France would starve.&quot;There was some dieoussion on tho subject at tho War Cabinet, when:&quot;It was pointed out that the French demand that we should take over fes additional portion of the Western front was due, not only to the reasons given-by M. Painleve&apos;, but also to tho de-cielon of the French Government that their men should receive 10 days&quot; leave in every quarter.   It was impossible, for sea transport reasons, to give our men. particularly the Colonialsoldiers.   It would, therefore, be very unrgur to ask our troops to take over an additional portion of the line to on-able French troops to have advantages which they themselves could not obtain, particularly when it was borne in mind that the French were fighting in tfeoir own country and our men in a foreign land.&quot;   (War Cabinet%4?A)On October 13, il PainlevS and M.    Franklin-Bouillon visited England and stayed with the Prime Minister at Cheeuor!8 Court, kt Painlevfi left on tho 13th, but M. Franklin-Bouillon stayed over, and more or Xese formal conversations were hold.    M. Franklin-Bouillon, and General Foch, who was also present, again urged the British Government to take over 100 kilometres of the Frenoh line at once, the reasons gives being much the same as before.    The Secretary of the War Cabinet made the following Kotos of the con-versation:-M H. FRASSXIK-30UILL011 and GENERAL FOCH urged tho great import-anoe of the British Government taking over 100 kiloa. of the French line at once.   M. Franklin-Bouillon said that from all over ^r&amp;noe messages were being received by the older men from their wives, who said they could not cultivate the land and
were faced with starvation unless those men were released from the Colours.    This, of course, caused great discontent in the Army.   In the classes of men of 4r&apos;48 and 49 years of age there were probably some 200,000 men.   If they were not re-leased the French would be faced with a most serious economic position.   Ilcithef this French Government nor any other could exist if this request were not acceded to.THE PRIME MINISTER explained the difficulties which the British Government met in acceding to this request.   Field    \ Marshal Sir Douglas Haigj he pointed out, was in the middle of a most important military offensivej and insisted that he could not possibly spare the numbers required while that of-fensive was in progress.   Forty-two divisions had been allot-ted to this offensive.    These divisions that had been engaged had lost many men, and had not yet been completed with drafts. It was impossible to utilise these to take over the French line.    It was equally impossible to utilise those divisions which still remained to be employed, or the offensive would some to an end.   Hence, until the weather automatically brought Sir Douglas Haig1s offensive to an end the question cotfld not be even considered.   Even then, however, the question prosont-ed groat difficulties to the British Government.   Field-Xar-shal Haig was anxious to renew his offensive at the earliest possible moment next year, and to enable him to do so it vras necessary to give the men leave, rest, and training.   Hence, to put them in the line was not consistent with the renewal of the offensive next year.   If the French Government had their political difficulties in this matter, so had the Brit-ish Government.    The British troops were not fighting in their own country, as wora the French.   For transport reasons it was impossible to   give them leave on the same scale as the French Government was doing to the French troops.    It was, however, impossible to convince the soldiers themselves of this.   Hence, if the troops, after bearing the brunt of tho fighting all the summer were then asked to take over more of the Frenoh line, and knsw, as they did know, that the French soldiers, who had had less fighting latterly, were receiving more leave than they themselves, it would cause great discontent in tho Army which would be echoed at homo.   He suggested two alternative methods dealing with the question for the consideration of the Frenoh Government(1) That tha British troops should be trained in camps in rear of the Frenoh lines, so that, in the event of an attaok, they should be thrown in to reinforce.M. FRANKLIN-BOUILLON and GENERAL FOCH both opposed this on military grounds.   They said it would be impossible from the point of view of communications to intermingle British troops with the French in the manner proposed.(2) That the British Government should undertake to make good to the Fresek Government the wheat which was lost by the failure to bring back their soldiers.M. FRANKLIN-30UILLON begged that the British Government would not make this second suggestion.    Ho said it would bo disas-trous to British prestige in Franco if, when they were asked to take over &amp; portion of the French line, they replied with a commercial offer of assistance in wheat.
H* FRANKtilN- BOUILLON then urged that a meeting between the two Prime Ministers, General Foch, General Robertson,, General Petain and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig should taie plaoe at once to settle tho question which was one of the utmost urgeney which $ould not wa-i-tir l! &apos;?THE PRIME MINISTER urged that this should be preceded by a meeting between Field-Marshal Haig and General Potain.M. FRANKLIN-BOUILLON, after expressing the view that this was quite useless because the differences between &quot;the two Commanders-in-Chief were so strong, undertook, immediately on his return to Franoe, to arrange for General Petain to meet Field Marshal Haig.&quot;
This is the Memorandum quoted above.On Ootober 16, Field^Mar-shal Sir-Douglas&quot;Haig sent a conamini-cation to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in regard to the ac-oeptance,in principle,by. the British Government at the Boulogne Confer-enoe, of an extension of the line.   In the course of this communicationhe writes as follows:-- s&quot;In my Secret Memorandum No.0.A.D.652, dated the 8th Instant,I have stated some of the objections to taking over moreline .from, the French, and I regret that the British Gov-ernment should have seen fit to decide a matter which mayinvolve such serious consequences without giving me anopportunity of stating my views *   In view of the consid-eration3 explained in my 1.A.D.S52, I trust that the WarCabinet will reconsider the question.&quot;The above document was forwarded to the War Cabinet by GeneralSir 7/illiam Robertson with the following remarks:-&quot;At the recent Boulogne Conference between the Prime Min-ister, M. Painleve&apos;, General Foch and myself, the question of extending our Front was raised by the French Represent-atives.   The reply given was that, while in principle we were of course ready to do whatever could be done, the matter was one which could not be discussed in the absence of Sir Douglas Haig, or during the continuance of the present ope^atians, . and that due regard must also be had to the plan of operations for next year.   It was suggested . that&apos; it would be best for the Field-Marshal to come to an arrangement with General Petain when this could be done. So far as I am aware, no further formal discussion has -taken place, and therefore the matter cannot be regarded as &apos;decided&apos;.   Further, I feel sure that the STar Cabinet would h^t think of deciding such an important question without first obtaining Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s views.   I am replying to him in the above sense.I should add that, on the day following the Boulogne Conference, the Prime Minister verbally informed Sir Douglas Haig of what had passed, and the latter then laid stress on the necessity of settling the plan for next year and then adjusting the line accordingly.   He also emphasized the great importance of our having Divisions out of the line for training purposes during the winter if we were to take the offensive next spring.   He has since emphasized the necessity of giving our men who have recently done much hard fighting, adequate leave of absence.11   (v7.P.59.) -On October 22, General Sir William Robertson forwarded a further communication from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, describing an inter-view he had had with General Petain on the question of taking over more line, and enclosing several documents giving their respective points of view.   These documents are very lengthy, and hardly lend themselves to
1 0 &amp;summary, but, broadly speaking, it may be stated that Field-MarshalSir Douglas Haig was pressing strongly for a resumption of the Flandersoffensive in 19181   to render this possibles it was necessary to restand train his troops , and this was not consistent with an extension ofhis linet   General Petain, on the other hand, anticipated that theGermans might increase their forces on the Western Front by 30, 40 oreven 50 Divisions, in which case he would be thrown on the defensive;for this he wanted further reserves.   He asked, as a beginning, that afront extending to the South of the Forest of St.Gobain should be takenover by the British.   In his oovering-note the Field-Marshal makes thefollowing observations:-&apos;&quot;In view of the acceptance by the British Government, as notified to me in the annexure to your 0.1/1.0. 7, of October 2, of the principle of taking over more line, I felt compelled to make the offer stated in Paper &quot;0&quot;. Your No.0.1/127/363, of the 18th Instant, received by me this evening, presents the conclusion arrived at on September  5th at Boulogne In a different light to the record contained in the annexure above quoted?   but, even 80* before the discussion with General Petain goes further, I must ask to be informed with the least,possible delay whether the War Cabinet will support me in a refusal to take over more than a 4-Division front.As my views on the&apos; question lusve already been stated fully for the information of the War Cabinet (my Paper No.0iA.D.65S4 dated October 8), it is unnecessary for me to enter into further explanations beyond urging again that, in my opinion, the prospects of decisive success in next year&apos;s campaign will depend mainly on the prose-cution of a, vigorous offensive by the British Array, and on the means to this being at my disposal.You will appreciate, however, the undeairability of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Armies in France refusing a request of the French Conumnder-in-Chief if the British Government finds itself unable subsequently to support the refusal.*In forwarding the above the Chief of the Imperial General Staffstated as follows:-&quot;As the War Cabinet are already aware, I agree with Sir Douglas Haig that the redistribution of front between the French and British&quot;Armies must be in aooordanoe with the decision agreed upon as to next year&apos;a plans of opera-tions;   and that,if the British Armies are to undertake offensive operations early next year, it is essential that the men who have been engaged in protracted attacks through-out the present year should have adequate leave and rest and receive the training necessary to assimilate the new drafts.&quot;   (General Staff No,0.1/127/363, dated October  2, 1917.)
These questions came before the War Cabinet ok October 24.1917, (War Cabinet a.56A).    The Minutes of this Meeting-record thatGeneral Sir William Robertson gave a summary of the circumstances,which differs in no particular from the summary given above, and atthe end of whioh he pointed out that Field-Marshal Haig:-&quot;Asked the War Cabinet to support him in his refusal to take over more than a 4 division front.   As the matter has recent-ly become mainly political.&quot; General Robertson continued?- &quot;so far as the French are concerned it is unlikely that the two Generals will bo able to arrivo at an agreement.   But it is necessary to send some reply to Field-Marshal Haig, and if the conditions which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had suggested should govern taking over the line are agreed to by the War Cabinet, and as we have not yet ourselves decided on our future military policy, it follows that it is hardly con-sis tent to say now whether ws should take orer a 4 division front or more or less than that.&quot;Tho Conclusion is recorded as follows:-&quot;The War Cabinet approved the suggestion of the Chief of tho Imperial General Staff that he should reply to Field-Marshal Haig in the following sensei-&quot;The War Cabinet are of opinion that, in deciding to what extent British troops can take over line from the French,f regard must bo had to the necessity for giving their reas-onable opportunity for leave, rest, and training during tha winter months, and to the plan of operations for next year; and^ further, that while the present offensive continues, It would not be possible to commence taking over more 3ine*&quot;The general military policy for next year is now under eon-Sideration, and will subsequently form a conference with the Allied Governments,    In these circumstances, the War Cab-inet feel that until this policy is settled it would be premature to decide finally whether the British front can be extended by 4 divisions, or to a greater or less extent than this.&quot;,-On October 30, 1917:-&quot;The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he had received a message that M. Painleve was arriving that af-ternoon and wished to see him at 7 o&apos;clock.   He had no doubt that the object of M. Psinleve^s visit was to indueo the British Government to take over part of the French line. He wished to ooneult his colleagues as to the line hi- s-as to-take.     Eis own view was that the War Cabinet are net in a position to decide.    It was first necessary to male complete exemination, in conjunction with our Allies, of the factors bearing on next year!s operations.&quot; (War^CaolrerThe remainder of a long meeting was taken up with a discussion of the first proposal for the establishment of the Versailles Council, on which the Prime Minister was authorised &quot;to send a letter to
fa Painleve, but the following conclusion was also reached&quot;The Prime Minister should be authorised to refuse M. Pain-levels proposal that we should take over a portion of the French line until some agreement had been reached in regard to the military plan of operations for 1918*   (War Cabinet 259AhThe following is an extract from the Prime Minister1s letterof October 30, 1917, to M, painleve:-&quot;This brings me to tho second point.   I do not think it is possible to decide about the taking over of more line by the British without regard to the plan of campaign for nest year. The question of who is to hold the line during the winter is inseparable from that of the character and extent of the of-fensive next year, and the respective parts to be played by the various Allies in that offensive, because the armies which are to take the offensive must spend the winter in hard train-ing.   This la exactly the sort of question which would be re-ferred to the Allied Council.   I, therefore, consider that it is of the utmost urgency that a decision should be come to about the Council without delay, and if the proposal is ap-proved, that it should be constituted as soon as possible.&quot;On the following day, October 31, 1917, the Prime LCinister inform-ad the War Cabinet of the inclusion of the above passage in hisletter and stated that:-&quot;M. Painleve and M. Franklin-Bouillon, whom he had seen that morning, had agreed that this was a fair stipulation.&quot; (War Cabinet  611)*At the end of October the sudden invasion of Italy ocourred, andet the beginning of November the Rapallo Conference was summoned.In the course of a discussion as to the line to be taken by theBritish representatives at the Rapallo Conference:-&quot;The Prime Minister also stated that General Petain had inform-ed him that arrangements had been made by Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and himself that the British should not only take the front occupied by General Anthoine1s Army on the British left, but should also take over a front at present occupied by 5 French divisions on the British right.&quot; (War Cabinet 264, Minute z).The actual extension of the line was somewhat delayed, first ow-Ing to the British attack at Cambrai, and then owing to tho German counter-attack.   On December 5, 1917, Sir William Robertson informed the ;Var Cabinet thst:-&quot;Sir Douglas Haig pointed out that he could not take over any of the Frenoh front until the situation was cleared up.&quot; (War Cabinet 292, Mliute 7).On December 6, 1917, General Robertson forwarded to the v?ar Cab-inet aorrespondence between Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Eaig and Gener-al Petain in regard to the extension of the line.   This was the first information that the War Cabinet had as to the progress of these negotiations, apart from the items of information recorded above.
ajft,     According to the corr^ai)oiiA6nce1.on the 2nd November, 1917,     1 S qField-Marshal Haig wrote to General Petain:-&quot;As I hare already informed you, I am prepared to extend my right as far as tho River Oise; and I can arrange to meet your wishes by also taking over a small sector south of the Hirer . . . The effect of this will bo to limit the extension of the British front to the neighbourhood of the Base For3t-St. Gobin Railway.&quot;In the course of the correspondence General Petain prosses Sir Douglas Haig on the 27th November&quot;Not to defer the extension of your line to Barieis.   Informa-tloa which I have lately reoeived bids me consider the possib-ility of German operations in Lorraine, in Alsace, or even against my right by way of Swiss territory, and consequently forces me to form a reserve consisting of as many divisions as possible; this is the reason why I attach such importance to the liberation of units holding the front of the third Army.On the 29th November, 1917, Field-Marshal Haig regrets that:-&quot;I am unable to accelerate this relief, as the 2 divisions -which are destined to carry it out have only just been brought out of the battle and a few days1 rest is absolutely essential for them before going into the line.   Owing to the number of troops I have been called upon to despatoh to Italy, I have no other divisions available, as the continued fighting irt on my Third Army front necessitates frequent reliefs there.&quot;On December 1, 1917, the Field-Marshal, after describing the sit-uation in the Cambrai area, states that:-&quot;The employment of my reserves in the battle,ka*30ffiei and the ex-hauation of the troops who will require relief will, I very much regret to say, render it necessary for me to postpone the relief of the Third French Corps which was to have commenced on tho 12th December&quot; &amp;o.Field Marshal Haig, after giving a summary of the position, ended as follows&quot;Under these circumstances, and while active operations are in progress on the British front, I do not feel justified in oarry-ing out any extension in relief of French troops.&quot;^Sir William Robertson^ inJhie covering Minute, also gave a summary ulcff d&amp;es-not differ- materially ,from FleVMterebaX Kail1 s summaryk sna jaah0*h9Tefore, be quoted somewhat fulltf.   hiU% Hheafcsirii the -events already related in this Memorandum, and after stating ihatj en the 24th Ootober, the decision of the War Cabinet Of that date&apos;, &amp;8 recorded afeere. was e*aagai8&amp;t*&amp; %* Sir Douglas Hai , he costiaued m fellows?-&quot;The latter theniarranged to study with General detain Spossible relief down to the Barisis-St. Gobin railway.&quot;After the receipt of orders to send 2 divisions to Italy this offer was reduced to an extension down to the Base Forot-St.&quot;Gobin railway, and then only if no more divisions were sent to Italy.
&quot;The present situation is that since the principle of ex-tending the line was accepted Sir Douglas Haig has been order-ed to send 5 divisions to Italy.   A sixth division (4th Aus-tralian) has been converted into a draft-finding unit, whilst, as the result of the Cambrai battle, his front will have been lengthened, necessitating the employment in the line of at loa3t one more division than before the battle.    This makes a total decrease of the strength of the 3ritish troops on the Western front available for reserve or for extension of tho line of 7 divisions, while our troops have been fighting oon-tinuously from July 31, to the present time.&quot;On the other hand, the French advance on the Ailette on 18th and 19th October,, shortened their front by the equival-ent of z divisions, and they have not fought since.   Further in the north the French have relieved 4 of our divisions, while wo have relieved six of theirs,, giving them the advantage of 2 on balance.   They thus have a relief of 4 divisions (2 on the Ailette and 2 in the north) to sot against the 6th they have sent to Italy.&quot;The result of these various changes is that, as compared with the situation before the Italian collapse the French are now 2 divisions to the bad and we are 4 divisions to the bad, plus the effect Of the Cambrai fighting.&quot;   (G.T.2884).At this time a Cabinet Committee was investigating the question [of Man-Power, which consisted of the Prime Minister, Lord Curzon, General Smuts, Mr. Barnes, and Sir Edward Carson.   On Saturday, Dec-ember 15, 1917, (although the question did not striotly concern the Mas-Power Committee), the extension of the line came up on a point of urgency.   The following is an extract from the Minutes:-&quot;Captain Amery, who had that morning returned from Versailles, reported that, on Thursday last, General Petain had discuss-ed with the French Cabinet the question of the holding of the Frenoh line.   General Petain stated that he could not continue to acocpt responsibility for holding tho French front unless the British were prepared to take over a considerable portion of the line now held by the French troops, and unless at the same time the French Government could find him 200,000 men from civilian sources to prepare defensive lines behind the front. Tho lattor undertaking had been given to General Petain by M, Clemenceau, who stated that he was determined to press the British Government to settle the former question at an early date, and threatened to present the matter to the French Chamb-er in the event of our refusal to meet the French request.   How-ever, H. Clemenceau had been willing to submit the French case to Versailles by Thursday next.&quot;&quot;The Prime Minister directed General Maurice to communicate the above facts to Sir William Robertson, who, it was unaerstood, was now at Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s Headquarters, asking thorn to prepare a full detailed statement of the British case for submission to ths Supreme War Council at the same time as the French.&quot;The Prime Minister added that he considered the matter one of the utmost seriousness and importance&quot;. (M.?.C.4thMeeting, Minute 1).
On December 17, Sir William Robertson circulated to the War Cabinet Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s case for ^he Supreme &apos;7ar Council. As this was prepared rather for the Council than for the S7ar Cabinet, and is a very long document, it is unnecessary to summar-ise it very fully.   It begins with an appreciation of the strategic cal considerations on the British front, pointing out the small room for manoeuvre, the importance of the objectives covered, and the low military value of the Belgians and Portuguese:    it contin-ues with a full statement of the exhaustion of the British Army after the prolonged operations of 1917, and particularly the Divi-sions in reserve, and alludes to the bad repair of our defences after a long period of the offensive:    it lays stress on the short-age of man-power, the deficiency in the Infantry, and the small leave allowance:    it contains a statement of the relative strength of the enemy on the British front:    it forecasts the probable re-duction of Infantry establishments&apos;,   Two passages must be quoted in full:-&quot;In the above circumstances, in my judgment the utmost that can be asked of the British Armiea is that they should hold their present front.    To extend it now would not only involve risks which I consider very grave, but would seriously hamper and delay the development of a strong defensive system which is urgent at the moment, and which, when It has been developed, will enable me to increase my reserves considerably.    By that time, too, I hope that my troops will have been rested and that my drafts to fill the ranks will have been received&quot; (M.P.0.31.)The other quotation is as follows&quot;So far as lies in my power, with due regard to the safety of my Armies, which is as necessary to our Allies as to the British Empire, I desire to fulfil the undertaking which, subject to certain conditions, I gave to General Petain, vis., to take over, as soon as possible, a two-Division front at least, and, if possible, a larger front extending to the St Gobain railway, a little South of ha Fere.   I estimate that, provided the enemy does not make any further offensive on the British front, that there is no indication of any considerable hostile offensive on that front, and that I receive reinforcements sufficient to bring all my Divisions to a strength of at least 10,000 Infantry, I shall be able to carry out the relief of two French Divisions (III French Corps) about the second week in January.&quot;   (M.P.C.&amp;1.)
$ In his covering Memorandum to the War Cabine&quot;U,^^G^aral^^Roberfcson stated as follows&quot;As regards M. Olemenceau^s request that we should take over the line as far as Berry-au-Bac, I con-sider this is quite impossible.    It would add 60 miles to our present front, and even if we held this new front very thinly (8,000 yards to a Divi-sion) we should require 13 or 14 Divisions for it, leaving only 7 weak and exhausted Divisions in re-serve on a total front of 155 miles without even good railway facilities.   Further, with 49 Divisions in the line -and only 7 in reserve, it would be neces-gary to keep the Divisions on the front for a period of six months without relief*. (M.P.0,21.)On December .18:-&quot;The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the -far Cabinet that he had conferred with Sir Douglas JSaig&apos; on the question of taking over more French line, and that Sir Douglas Eaig had put forward very strong observations on the subject which he had sent to General Wilson,   General Ro..bertson informed the War Cabinet that he w&amp;g circulating to the War Cabinet, .during the course of that afternoon, these observa-tions, together with some of his owrf,   The Prime Minister stated that he had received a telegram from M. Clemenceau, indicating that Sir Douglas Haig and General Petain had been unable to agree on the matter of taking over more of the French line:   that he (M, Clemenoeau) proposed that the question should be sub-mitt ed to Versailles, and that he would agree to abide, by the decision arrived at there if the Prime Minister &apos; was also prepared to accept it. The War Cabinet decidedt-To send a telegram to M. Clemenceau, saying that they agreed to the exam-ination of the question by the Military Experts at Versaillest with a view to the final decision by the Supreme ffar Council in accordance with the Raps11o Agreement;   at the sao e time informing M. Olemenceau that they had already referred the oase to the Military Advisers in ques-tion.&quot;   (War Cabinet 301, Minute 8.)The Military Representatives reported on January 10, 1918, asfollows&quot;The Military Representatives recommend that the point of junction between the British Forces and French Forces should be on the left bank of the Ailette and Laon-Soissons road, the exact point to be fixed by the Commander-in-Chief.   The sections of the French line taken over should be occupied consecu-tively as may be arranged between the Commanders-in-Chiefr and this extension should be carried out as a continuous operation,   They also recommendSpTE by the Secretary.These are the observations quoted in the immediately preceding paragraphs.)
on the one-&quot;Tiand, that the studyand: preparartIon,-.T &quot; should at once be undertaken for an extension of the British front South of this point, in the event of any enemy attack exhausting the reserves of the French forces outside their present front (for example., by an enemy offensive through Switzerland), and then that study and pre-paration should at once be undertaken for an exten-sion of the French front North of this point in the event of any enemy attack exhausting the reserves on the British front.&quot; (Joint Note No,10.)On January 23, the date of the Supreme War Council Meetingwas considered at the War Cabinet,   It was decided to ask for the30th January, and it was decided that&quot;The Prime Minister and Lord Milner represent the British Cabinet at that Council, and that full powers be given to them to decide all questions relating to - (a) The extension of the British front:and(b) The disposition and Command of the General Reserve on1the Allied Western Front,&quot;(War Cabinet 329, Minute 13.)January 25:-&quot;The War Cabinet instructed the Director of Military Operations to inform Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig that the Prime Minister would see him at Versailles, on Tuesday next, the 29th January, 1918.The Director of. Military Operations pointed out that the decision to be taken now concerning the extension of the British front should not be af-fected by the expectation of American reinforce-merits, as there could not be enough Americans in line to modify the situation seriously before June&quot;.(War Cabinet 331, Minute 4.)On Tuesday, January 29th. the Prime Minister and Lord Milnerhad a Conference at the Plots! Trianon, Versailles, with Sir WilliamRobertson, Sir Douglas Haig, Sir Henry Wilson and General  awrence,the Minute a of which, in regard to the extension of the Britishline, are as follows&quot;The Conference discussed the question of the exten-si on of the British line.   The Prime Minister inti-mated his Intention of supporting Field-Marshal . Haig and General Robertson in their opposition to the proposed extension, and discussed seriatim the various arguments put forward on the subject by Field-Marshal Haig.    It was arranged that these arguments should be further developed by Field-Marshal Haig, end forwarded to the Prime Minister before the meeting on the following day&quot;.
At the Supreme ??ar Council the question of the extensionof the line was held over until after the discussion on the planof campaign of 1918 and the creation of a General Reserve, as itwas recognised to be dependent on this.   The Minutes of the meet-ing are too long to reproduce here, but are contained in PaperI,Gt&quot;d&amp;r, attached herewith,   tt, Clemenoeau urged the adoptionof Joint Mote 10 cf the Military Representatives,   Sir DouglasHaig, after quoting many instances in which he had met French re-queSts with a desire to comply, stated as follows:-&quot;Lastly, during the recent battle in Flanders, he had, at General Petain&apos;s request,agreed to and had now extended the front, first to the Oise and afterwards to Bar is is, although his troops were in great need of rest and training after the severe fighting they had been through, and notwithstanding he had also to detach Divisions to Italy.&quot;He than adduced the various arguments against an extension, whichhave already been given in this Memorandum.Mr Lloyd George asked General Petain whether it was a fact that he and Sir Douglas Haig had agreed that the British front should extend to Barisis only.      General Ftlain confirmed this, but stated that he had later been obliged to ask for a considerable extension.   He urged that the recommendation of the Military Re-presentatives should be ratified, giving reasons.-17***-
She Prime Mlsieter then made an important Statement, whioh is tperted in the prods verbal as fellows:-&quot;MRiLLOYD GEORGE asked that before the Joint Hots was adopted he.might be allowed to put before the Supreme V?ar Council cer-tain very serious considerations.   The Field-Marshal had said that he oouid hardly be held responsible for the security of his front if he had to extend his lino.   He had pointed out that the most vital parts of the Allied fronts were held by the British,   $he British lines of communication ran parallel to their front, and the enemy were only ton miles off; this constituted a very dangerous situation.   Further, an advance of a few kilometres by the Germans on the French front would not be a very grave matter.   If, however * tho Germans advance ed only six miles in Flanders they would deprive us of car-tain valuable eoal mines, whioh at present provide no lose than tan million tons of ooal a year.   If they wore deprived of this supply of ooal it would have to be made up by Great Britaine   This would mean a large diversion of labour to the ooal mines, and of tonnage for the transportation of ooal across the Channel .   Th&amp; second point was partly military and partly politioal in character.   Th$ French soldier by the law of his country   and he would remind the Council that the French were fighting on their own soil   got loave every four months; the British soldier, on the other hand, got leave oa-ly oaoo s^rear.   She British Army had oome to be aware of this fast, which was causing the gravest dissatisfaction.   No doubt this disparity in regard to the granting of leave was in part due to the shortage of tonnage, but it was a serious considers-tion whioh could not be Ignored.   He would remind the Supreme War Council that the British Commander-in-Chief had said that if he had to extend his front he could not be responsible for the security of his line.   If, therefore, the Council decided to accept the reoemiaendatlon of the Military Kepressntatives, a very grave responsibility would rest upon them.   There were then throe considerations whioh he wished to put before his col-leagues,-&quot;(1) That the British hold a line whioh covered indispens-able ports and valuable ooal mines, neither of whieh was it possible for us to relinquish:&apos;*(2) Ths question of leave;n(3) She British had borne the brunt of the fighting during the past year, and as they had advanced their line in many places it was Impossible to give the men the rest they badly needed, as it was necessary to prepare new lines of defence.   Further, these lines had to be eonstrueted in tho abominable climate of Flanders, whioh was very different from the climate cf Italy, for instance.&quot;If in addition to the dissatisfaction caused by the disparity in regard to leave, by the neeosaity of having to forgo their well-earned rest in order to construct new lines of defence, the British Army were told that they had to take over a new portion of the French front they would be seriously dishesrt-enad to say the least of it.   He therefore would again press that a solution of the difficulty might be found by transfer-ring Italian divisions to  ranee.   A large contribution of Italian troops to the Western front would, in his opinion, best solve the most difficult problem whioh il. Clemenceau and he had to consider.   Mr. Lloyd George thought that the question of the extension of the line and that of the trans-ferenoe of Italian troops to Flanders should bo oonsidered together.n
General Petain continued to press that the recommendations of the Military Representatives should &quot;be accepted, but he agreed that the execution and method of carrying out the extension should be left to the two Commanders-in-Chief.After some discussion the Prime Minister retired into thepassage with Field-karshal Sir Douglas1 Haig,   On their return, Mr.Lloyd George said that:-&quot;He understood that the Field-Marshal would now be prepared to ascent the recommendations in Joint Note No.10i in princi pie, subject to an agreement between himself and General Pe-tain as to the method of giving effect to it; the resolution therefore, that Was aboiit to be moved must not be regarded as an order requiring immediate execution.&quot;The decision of the Supreme War Council was as follows;-&quot;The Supreme War Council adopt Note 10, subject to the time and method of the extension of the British line4 being lef^ for arrangement between General Petain and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig.&quot;This decision was reported by the Prime Minister wo the War Cabinet on February 4, 1918.    (War- Cabinet 338, Minute 4),It was not until February 8, 1910, that the War Cabinet were informed that the British front had been extended to Barisis. (War Cabinet 541, Minute 1).This was the last reference to the subject at the War Cabinet and no extensions were made beyond the extension at Barisis arrang od between Field-Marshal Hsig and General Petain. , Whitehall Gardens, S.W,, Malt ?, 1918.

M. Clemenceau ouvre la seance. II indique 1&apos;ordre du jour : Plan de cam-pagne de 1918, Reserve interallied Com-mandement de cette Reserve.M. Lloyd George propose qu&apos;on adopte la methode de travail du Parlement anglais, et qu&apos;il soit procede pour chaque question a deux lectures : 1&apos;une sur le fond de la question, 1&apos;autre sur les amendements proposes. Cette proposi-lion est adoptee.M. Clemenceau declare ouverte la dis-cussion sur le plan de campagne de 1918. La parole sera successivement donnee aux Chefs d&apos;Etat-Major generaux et aux Commandants en Chef.Le General Foch:L,esciv Constances nous obligent, pour le debut de 1918, a rester dans une situation expectante. D&apos;oii ne-cessite d&apos;avoir un plan defensif de Nieu-port a Venise, qui puisse, selon les circon-stances, se transformer en plan offensif total ou partiel.Notre plan defensif doit etre etabli de facon a pouvoir repondre a plusieurs at-taques ennemies declanchees sur differ-entes armees alliees, d&apos;ou necessite de combiner entre eux les moyens de defense de ces armees. En dehors des organisa-tions defensives a creer dans chaque armee, des reserves dont cliaque armee doit disposer pour repondre a une at-taque sur son front, il est necessaire davoir des reserves generates qui puis-sent etre transporters d&apos;un point a 1&apos;autre du front a 1&apos;endroit le plus menace, ou puissent etre reunies pour une contre-effensive de degagement destinee a mettre fin a une attaque acharnee de 1&apos;ennemi sur un des Allies. II est done necessaire de preparer en meme temps que la def en-si ve ces manoeuvres offensives. Les Etats-Majors des armees anglaise, francaise et italienne pourraient en etablir les plans. I/es propositions seraient faites par les Commandants en Chef et examinees par les Chefs d&apos;Etat-Major.M. Clemenceau suggested that the Supreme War Council should first con-si der Note 12 of the Military Representa-tives dealing with the general plan of operations for 1918.Mr. Lloyd George concurred and sug-gested that the Note should be given what in English Parliamentary procedure would be called a second reading, Le., that its general principles should be accepted, subject to such amendments or alterations in detail as might emerge as a result of subsequent discussion.The Supreme War Council having accepted the Note in principle, M. Cle-menceau invited General Foch to open the discussion in detail.General Foch said that he was in agreement with the Note that the Allies would have to be on the defensive on the jWestern front, from Nieuport to Venice, at any rate in the opening stages of the campaign of 1918, but that this defensive might, according to circumstances, be converted into an offensive, as indicated in the plans annexed to the Note. It was necessary to envisage the possibility of attacks for the purpose of which the enemy would have absorbed large forces brought over from Russia. The Allied plan must take account both of the defen-sive organisation of each of the armies and. in the event of a realty important attack, of the necessity of a. General Reserve. A General Reserve which could be moved from one part of the front to the other was a necessary feature of a plan of defence involving so long a front with limited resources. He summed up the fundamental bases of the Allied de-fence for 1918 as, firstly, the complete arrangements on the front of each Army and, secondly, the possibility of an appeal to the total reserves of the coalition in order to meet a very heavy attack. He-presumed that the respective Chiefs of Staff and Commanders-in-Chief would work out their plans on these lines.Secretariat.: Secretariat:Major Martin Franklin. Colonel Grant, U.S.A.

Le General Robertson est (Taecord avec le General Foch pour que Toffensive soit combinee avec la defensive. Des terrains d&apos;attaque ont ete prepares dans ce but dans les armees anglaise et f rancaise. Le General Foch a parle dUne offensive a grande envergure, c&apos;est une question de moyens, sur laquelle il faudrait entendre les Geheraux en Chef.Le General Cadorna approuve egale-ment la these du General Foch, qui est du reste celle des Representants militaires du Conseil superieur de Guerre. Cest la doctrine mise en pratique dans 1&apos;armee italienne, ainsi que le montre Fattaque si bien reussie au]&apos;ourd&apos;hui.Le General Bliss estime aussi que tous les preparatifs d&apos;une contre-offensive doi-vent etre faits. La creation d&apos;une reserve generale est essentielle.Le Marechal Haig est daccord avec le General Foch en ce qui concerne la defen-sive. II approuve en principe la doctrine offensive, mais on manque de moyens pour passer a 1&apos;execution.Trois terrains dattaque ont ete pre-pares par Farmee anglaise, 1&apos;armee fran-caise en a prepare quatre; mais, d5une part, 1&apos;ennemi peut faire avorter hos plans en se retirant devant les secteurs prepares; d&apos;autre part, les effectifs dont nous disposons ne nous permettront sans doute pas d&apos;entreprendre ces operations.Si 1&apos;ennemi nous attaque en force, nous serons en effet, du fait de nos effectifs, dans une situation tres grave a 1&apos;automne. En temps normal nos ressources sont superieures de 5,000 hommes seulement a nos pertes mensuelles, soit 45,000 (3 D.I.) en neuf mois. Si dans ce laps de temps se livrent de durs combats, avec des pertes equivalentes a Feffectif de 33 D.I. ce sera une perte nette de 30 D.I. (soit un demi-million dTiommes). Or, 1&apos;armee anglaise compte pour Finstant 57 D.I., auxquelles on pourra a j outer F equivalent en hommes de 8 D.I. americaines (si les plans se realisent), soit au total 65 D.I. En novembre, en admettant les chiffres ci-dsssus, elle serait done reduite a 35 D.I. L&apos;armee francaise doit s&apos;attendre a des reductions d&apos;effectifs analogues.Signor Orlando expressed the view-that the arrangements for the defensive and the constitution of the General Reserve were intimately connected.Sir W. Robertson agreed with General Foch that it was necessary to have arrangements for an offensive combined with the defensive. The offensive was, in fact, the best form of defensive. General Foch, however, proposed an offensive on a bigger scale than he thought possible. It was all a question of means. He suggested that the opinion of the Commanders-in-Chief should be asked as to the means at their disposal.General Cadorna said that the prin-ciples expressed by General Foch and Sir W. Robertson were the same as those upon which the Military Representatives had based their plans. The only question was carrying those principles into execu-tion.General Bliss said that he was in full concord as to the necessity for a general defensive in 1918, coupled with prepara-tions for making use of every opportu-nity afforded for a counter-offensive. In his opinion, the formation of a General Reserve was an essential part of the general plan.Sir Douglas Haig agreed with General Foch and Sir William Robertson as to the necessity for acting on the defensive to begin with, and if possible passing over to the offensive later. He doubted, how-ever, if means for the latter were avail-able. He had prepared three sectors on the front for an offensive, and General Petain had, he understood, four similar sectors. The idea was to attract the enemy&apos;s reserves, but it was always pos-sible, or, indeed, probable, that the enemy would take counter-measures, and that these local attacks might fail to draw away many of the enemy&apos;s reserves. In fact, we cannot hope, with the small means at our disposal, to secure very great results from these offensives. On the other hand, a large offensive such as had been indicated by General Foch was not, in his opinion, practicable. He con-sidered that if the enemy attacked in force the situation would be very serious by the autumn. In the case of the British Army the normal excess of recruits coming in over casualties was about 5,000 a month. It was necessary to admit the possibility of a loss of 500,000 men, equivalent to the loss of 33 divisions, by November in the event of heavy fighting; or, deducting for the normal excess of recruits coming in for
Le ecmcours des Americains ne peut etre escompte pour cette annee. L&apos;experi-ence montre en effet qu&apos;il a fallu aux D.I. anglaises, pour acquerir leur valeur com-bative, neuf mois d&apos;entrainement prea-lable en Angleterre et six mois d&apos;instruc-tion en France dans les secteurs calmes. L armee americaine ne pourra done pas cette annee soutenir le choc de Farmee allemande si on lui donne un secteur com-plet a tenir. Ce sont les seules armees anglaise et francaise qui auront a s&apos;oppo-ser aux attaques allemandes.Le General Petain est d&apos;accord sur les principes defensive et defensive exposes par le General Foch. Mais la situation des effectifs oblige a garder une attitude expectante.Pour pouvoir executer les offensives de-mandees par le General Foch, il faut d&apos;abord que Fennemi ne nous previenne pas sur les terrains prepares et ne se derobe pas, d&apos;ou necessite davoir de nom-breux fronts cFattaque, possibles. A ce point de vue, des plans ont ete etablis en complete communion de vues par les Etats-Major anglais et francais. Une armee francaise a ete prevue pour porter secours, le cas eeheant, aux Anglais.Mais, pour les effectifs, le General Petain arrive a des conclusions analogues a celles du Marechal Haig. Les Frangais ont fait tout F effort possible. Ils ont appele jusqu&apos;aux hommes de 50 ans. Or, les ressources de recrutement ont oblige a supprimer 5 D.I. depuis un mois. Jusquau l,r avril les pertes de Farmee francaise ne pourront etre comblees qu&apos;avec peine et, encore, s&apos;il n&apos;y a pas de combats. Entre le ler avril et le ler octobre il faudra supprimer 25 D.I.; et meme davantage, s&apos;il y a une grande bataille.Le General Petain partage Favis du Marechal Haig au sujet du concours americain. L&apos;armee americaine ne sera cFaucun secours si elle veut conserver son autonomie en 1918, parce que, si ses sol-dats et ses cadres subalternes sont excel-lents, elle ne pourra avoir, cette annee, un Commandement et des Etats-Majors. N&apos;ayant pas le noyau dont disposait Farmee anglaise, elle mettra plus long-temps qu&apos;elle pour se constituer. L&apos;armeethe nine months, for a net loss of 30 divi-sions. The present strength of the British Army was 57 divisions, and even after allowing for the addition of Ameri-can units of a total strength equivalent to 8 divisions, that would mean that by the end of October the British Force would have sunk to about 35 divisions.As regards the American Forces, our own experience had been that our new divisions required nine months&apos; home training and six months&apos; training in France before they were fit for hard fight-ing, though they could be put into quiet sections of the line before that. Nor could one expect that the American divisions could be placed in the line together in any number without inviting a heavy German attack. He consequently did not con-sider the Allies could expect the Ameri-can Force, as a force, to be of effective support this )^ear.General Petain agreed with the prin-ciples expressed by the previous speakers in favour of combining the measure of offensive with the defensive. He had already organised schemes for the offen-sive, and the whole of the plans, both for the defensive and for the preparation of sectors for local attacks, had been com-pleted between Sir Douglas Haig and himself. He would have an Army ready to support Sir Douglas Haig in an emer-gency, and he knew Sir Douglas Haig would be ready to assist him in the same manner. With regard to the question of effectives, he agreed with Sir Douglas-Haig that the situation was very serious. The French nation had made all the effort it could make, and could go no further. Men of fifty years of age were with the colours, and every man who could dig or handle an instrument of any sort was in the trenches. He had already been compelled to suppress 5 divisions, and though he would be able to fill up the gaps in his Army up to the 1st April, he would be compelled between that date and the 1st October to suppress 25 divisions more, bringing the Army down to some-thing like 75 divisions, simply in conse-auence of the normal losses along the front, and without any heavy fighting. If there were a big battle the losses of that battle would involve still further reduc-tions.As regards the American Army, he agreed entirely with the conclusions arrived at by Sir Douglas Haig. In fact, in his opinion, the American Army, if it wished to retain its autonomy, would be of no use to the Allies in 1918, except, perhaps, along some quiet section of the

In his opinion, theentry of American troops by battalions or regiments into French or English divi-sions, not only for training, but also for fighting, was muchj the greatest assist-ance that the United States could give the Allies, and would furnish the solution of the crisis with regard to effectives. It would also mean a saving of tonnage if the United States concentrated on send-ing over their infantry in the first instance, and leaving the artillery, horses, &amp;c, to come later. The suggested amalgamation, of course, was only tem-porary. The American Army would get back its units afterwards and become fullv autonomous. Unless this were done the reductions in divisions foreseen by him and by Sir Douglas Haig would cer-tainly come into effect, and the war would enter into a very critical period.M.

Lastly, he wished to have the total number of guns on both sides, heavy and field guns being distinguished. He suggested that these questions should be worked out by each of the General Staffs separately, and drew attention to the extreme import-ance of each General Staff being clear as to its definition of what they include in the term &quot; combatant,&quot; so as to make sure that their estimate of Allied and enemy strengths should be on the same basis.
sM. Clemenceau demande que les Etats-Majors allies se mettent d&apos;accord dans le plus bref delai sur les chiffres de-mandes par M. Lloyd George, car on ne peut evidemment faire de plans sans connaitre les moyens dont on dispose,II est entendu que ces donnees seront preparees pour le lendemain.M. Sonnino demande si les Americains acceptent Famalgame.(La seance est levee.   La continuation de la discussion est fixee au lendemain.) till 3 p.m. on the 31st January.)M. Clemenceau agreed that it was no use making plans if the Allies had not the means to carry them out. He fully realised&quot; how difficult it was to arrive a&quot;t any common agreement in international matters, and that to make agreement sure and to enable the Supreme War Council to decide courageously, and even heroically, it was necessary to be clear about the actual facts. Making plans was an easy matter, but their execution came up against the question of the actual means. The task to be undertaken had to. be proportionate of the means available.Mr. Lloyd George suggested that the Joint Secretaries should frame a ques-tionnaire, and in view of the fact that the British Representatives had not the available staff with them, that the basis alreadv taken by the British for estimat-ing combatants should be adopted. He again laid stress, in answer to a sug-gestion from General Petain, that the relative strengths were sufficiently indi-cated by the number of divisions, that he wished to have the figures worked out in actual numbers of men. He pointed out that the battalions in the British Army stood at 1,000 men, those in the German Army at about 750, and in the French Army between 600 and 700.M. Clemenceau suggested that the com-parative figures might be drawn up in two columns, one column giving the divisional strengths and the other the strengths in combatants.The Supreme War Council agreed that the Secretaries should prepare a questionnaire as suggested, to which the respective General Staffs would furnish their several answers by the following morning.Baron Sonnino wished to bring the discussion back to the question whether the United States would agree to the temporary amalgamation of their forces in British and French units.Mr. Lloyd George suggested that till the Supreme War Council knew what the actual situation was, and the extent of the need for men, it was undesirable to go into the matter at this stage.(The Supreme War Council adjourned

Clemenceau, as Chairman, put for-ward the Joint Note 12 submitted by the Military Representatives on the 1918 campaign.Mr. Lloyd George called attention to some discrepancies in the figures which had been placed before the Supreme War ^Council in the form of tables by the General Staffs, in accordance with the instructions given at the meeting on the previous day.   These were explained.
On examine ensuite les chiffres portes comme ressources dans les depots. A leur sujet, le General Foch compare pour la France et Angleterre I0 L&apos;effort militaire deja fait;2D La situation des ressources actuel-lement existantes ou prevues pour1&apos;annee 1918; 30 Les ressources restant a exploiterdans chacun des deux pays.Les chiffres exposes sont donnes dans le tableau joint au proces-verbal.ii en conclut a la necessite pour 1&apos; Angleterre de faire de suite un grand effort pour exploiter les ressources encore disponibles.M. Lloyd George fait observer que plusieurs faits fondamentaux ont ete laisses de cote par le General Foch.La Grande-Bretagne supporte la charge de la plus grande partie des transports maritimes; elle assure la liberte des mers; de ce fait, elle emploie dans sa flotte de 400,000 a 500,000 hommes.La France, privee d&apos;une grande partis de sa houille, doit la recevoir d&apos;Angle-terre, qui en fournit egalement a 1&apos;Italic.Sur les chantiers navals d5 Angleterre, on a construit depuis , le debut de la guerre 4,000 navires; les reparations de tous les navires en service constant sur la mer necessitent un personnel nom-breux.1,000,000 de tonnes ont ete mises a la disposition de la France, et cela ne sufht pas encore.ii faut done a 1&apos;Angleterre des mar ins, des mineurs, des constructeurs: si elle cessait de fournir a ses Allies du charbon et des navires, la guerre serait terminee en six mois.Quant k 1&apos;Irlande, le Premier Ministre ne demanderait qu&apos;a utiliser ses res-sources, si les contingents qu&apos;elle don-nerait etaient utilisables dans les memes conditions que les autres contingents de 1&apos; Angleterre.On ne peut, certes, comparer les sacri-fices de la France et de 1&apos;Angleterre. Mais cela tient en partie a ce que 1&apos;Ang-leterre n&apos;a eu pendant les deux premieres annees de guerre qu&apos;une petite armee. Le chiffre de ses pertes est en somme a repartir seulement sur deux annees, et, en 1917, c&apos;est elle qui a supporte sans doute les plus grandes pertes de tous les Allies.Enfin, il faut tenir compte de la psychologie des peuples; le patriotisme de la France, a laquelle sa situation geographique a impose a plusieurs re-The figures given for men available in depots as drafts were then considered. In this connection General Foch insti-tuted a comparison between France and England in respect of 1. The military effort already made; 2. The actual resources in man-poweravailable at present or in 1918; 3. The resources in man-power that /&apos;     could  still be got from eachcountry.The figures quoted by him are given in a table annexed to the minutes.He reached the conclusion that Eng-land should at once make a great effort to get more men for military purposes.Mr. Lloyd George pointed out that there were two sides to the question: Great Britain had made naval and eco-nomic efforts which France had never been called upon to make, and for all of which labour in great quantities was indispensable. Acknowledging as he did the splendid sacrifices in blood France had made, the British figures were creeping up to the French. There were circumstances in the history, the tradition, and the social condition that made it necessary to handle British masses with more circumspection than the French masses.
prises des incursions ennemies, a une puissance toute particuliere. En Angle-terre, le patriotisme est grand; au debut de la guerre, 4,000,000 d&apos;homines se sont engages votontairement; mais, si on voulait prendre pour les armees les 3,000,000 d&apos;hommes en age d&apos;y servir, on risquerait de graves dangers; Taccueil fait tout recemment dans certains milieux ouvriers aux propo-sitions du Gouvernement anglais en est. la preuve.Le General Foch demande la parole. M. Clemenceau la lui donne, a condition que sa reponse ne contienne aucune critique des methodes de Gouvernement anglaises.Le General Foch sans discuter les besoins speciaux qui viennent d&apos;etre indiques, remarque que plus un pays a de besoins de cet ordre, plus il doit mobiliser de classes; il peut ainsi faire face a ces besoins avec les vieilles classes, et garder les jeunes pour le front.M. Lloyd George declare que le Gouvernement britannique doit tenir compte d&apos;autres considerations que des considerations militaires.M. Clemenceau estime que le Conseil superieur de Guerre doit s&apos;en tenir la de la discussion des effectifs. Restent les chiffres.M. Lloyd George propose de discuter des chiffres entre Ministres.M. Clemenceau estime, au contraire, que c&apos;est un probleme militaire et il de-mande que les Geheraux en Chef expos-ent le parti qu&apos;ils peuvent tirer des effectifs mis a leur disposition par les Gouvernements.On s&apos;e^t mis d&apos;accord sur le principe d&apos;un plan defensif avec contre-offensives partielles; reste a savoir s&apos;il y a lieu ou non de preparer une grande contre-offen-sive combinee et de constituer une Re-serve generale interallied.M. Lloyd George dit qivun plan etudie par les Representants militaires fait Fobjet de la Note collective No. 12 et de-mande qu&apos;on 1&apos;examine.M. Clemenceau propose d&apos;interrompre la seance quelques instants afin que chacun puisse relire cette note.II est ainsi fait. La seance est inter-rompue a 16 heures 30.M .ClemenceauTuled that while General Foch was entitled to draw the deductions he had made from the figures, none of these remarks were.to be interpreted as criticisms of an Ally. The question that now faced the Supreme War Council was military. Assuming the figures in front of them to stand, what was to be their plan of action.Mr. Lloyd George proposed to adopt the Joint Note No. 12 on the 1918 Cam-paign, subject to any amendments that might be introduced.Then followed a debate as to whether or not the effort in the East, recom-mended by the Military Representatives, should take place.M. Clemenceau proposed to ask the Commanders-in-Chief oh the Western front what he considered the essential question: Can they hold the front in 1918?
La seance est rouverte a 17 heures.M. Clemenceau: La deuxieme partie de la Note 12 conclut a faire une operation contre la Turquie, si les effectifs peuvent etre maintenus sur les fronts d&apos;Occident. Ces effectifs ne pouvant etre maintenus, cette proposition tombe.M. Lloyd George: La proposition de-meure, si la situation en France et en Italic &quot;est assuree; sinon, elle tombe. Mais il faut etablir 1&apos;operation proposee en dehors de ce que peuvent dire les Geheraux presents. Le General Smuts a accepte d&apos;aller etablir sur place les possibilites de cette -operation.M. Clemenceau est d&apos;accord avec M. Lloyd George. Les Generaux presents doivent repondre a cette question. Les effectifs dont vous disposerez vous per-mettent-ils de garantir la securite des fronts de France et d&apos;Italie en 1918? Sinon, 1&apos;operation contre la Turquie de-vient une impossibilite.M. Lloyd George n&apos;est pas tout a fait d&apos;accord.Pendant longtemps, les Allemands ont tenu le front devant nous avec une inferiorite de 2 contre 3^.Notre erreur a ete de nous concentrer dans 1&apos;Occident sans rien tenter en Orient. Si nous avions abattu la Turquie quand la Russie etait en guerre, nous aurions les Dardanelles, et a notre dis-position des ressources de toute nature que rien ne peut maintenant empecker FAllemagne d&apos;exploiter.II ne faut pas nous laisser hypnotise r par ce qui est pres de nous. Les Alle-mands, sachant qu&apos;ils ne pouvaient nous battre sur le front occidental, se sont successivement attaques a la Serbie, a la Roumanie aux plus faibles.II faut faire tomber un de nos enne-mis; si nous n&apos;agissons pas ainsi en ap-pelant 1&apos; imagination a notre secours, nous en serons toujours au liieme point.Comment finira la guerre?Est-il possible de rejeter les Allemands au dela du Rhin? Je le croyais, je n&apos;en suis plus sur; il faut done faire sortir de la lutte un des allies de 1&apos;Allemagne.M. Orlando croit que la divergence de vues vient d&apos;une interpretation differente de 1&apos;avis des Representants militaires. Cet avis exclut la diminution des forces des fronts occidentaux, et indique que les forces sont sufiisantes en Orient pour le but cherche. On parle done seulement de mieux cultiver ce champ d&apos;operations militaires.Mr. Lloyd George did not agree. We must be secure in the West at all costs; no victory elsewhere can compensate for decisive defeat in the West; if necessary f or this purpose he would withdraw every soldier from the East, but we had always over-insured ourselves in the West. He described the advantages Germany had reaped from her Eastern efforts, and those we might have had and still might get. His plan was to knock Turkey out; if not, how, he asked, are you going to end the war ? General Smuts had been deputed to proceed to Egypt to study the situation with a view to the most vigorous prosecution of the war against Turkey.Signor Orlando remarked that the proposal of the Military Represen-tatives did not involve an expedition that would weaken the forces on the West, but only a further cultivation of the military situation there, and he thought, therefore, that the disagree-ment between Mr. Lloyd George and M. Clemenceau rested on a misunderstand-ing.    He thought Mr. Lloyd George
M. Clemenceau: Les operations mili-taires comportent un melange cFaudace et de prudence. II y a des heures pour la prudence, et des heures pour la temerite. Nous sommes a la troisieme annee de guerre, il faut se metier des exces d&apos;imagination.En relisant les restrictions de 1&apos;article 4 de la Note No. 12, M. Clemenceau revient a sa question: Les Geheraux en Chef sont-ils assures de leur front pendant la campagne 1918? En dehors de cela, 1&apos;Angleterre peut faire les expeditions lointaines qrFelle juge necessaire.Aujourd&apos;hui apres trois ans de pertes enormes, arrive sur notre front la I71e Division allemande; ce n&apos;est pas en vain que Fennemi y accumule ainsi ces forces. Mais FAllemagne n&apos;a pas vaincu la Russie militairement; la Russie a train, et le jour oil elle trahissait, FAmerique se levait. Le defaut de notre raisonne-ment est de 1&apos;avoir oublie.&quot; Oui, j&apos;ai un moyen de finir la guerre. Cest de donner.a FAmerique, qui nous apporte sa volonte, son courage, son sang, ses ressources immenses, le temps qu&apos;elle nous demande pour etre a nos cotes avec toute sa puissance.&quot;Si ce qu&apos;ont dit hier le Marechal Haig et le General Petain sur le chiffre cles divisions qu&apos;ils devront dissoudre, faute d&apos;effectifs, est exact, 6&apos;ils&quot; ne se levent pas pour nous dire qu&apos;ils se sont trompes, nous ne pouvons aller chercher la victoire sur 1&apos;Euphrate.&quot; L&apos;echange de vues fait entre M. Lloyd George et le General Foch a fait ressortir notre defalliance au point de vue des effectifs. Si Ton veut faire cette expedition d&apos;Orient, il faut donner des homines.&apos;&apos;II y a lieu d&apos;en revenir a 1&apos;annexe de la Note No. 12, qui traite de Fattitude a tenir sur le front occidental. La realisa-tion de la partie relative a la Turquie reste a F initiative du Gouvernement britannique.Le Baron Sonnino remarque que cette discussion a pour base une question d&apos;effectifs.Hier, on a expose une methode pour accelerer Faide americaine, en proposant d&apos;amalgamer provisoirement Finfanterie americaine aux troupes franchises et anglaises. Si cette aide n&apos;arrive que lorsque les Allies seront trop affaiblis, elle sera une simple substitution et non un renforcement.convincing. If we cannot win on the Western front, we yet may win by knock-ing out an ally of Germany, and Turkey is the weakest of them.M. Clemenceau expressed his disap-probation of the Eastern plan of the Joint Note, and insisted that the security of the Western front overrode all other considerations. The treason of Russia (he used the word deliberately) had ex-posed the Allies to the greatest danger they had yet run in the war, but the accession of America to the Alliance would counterbalance it. This was his plan to hold out this year, 1918, till the American assistance came in full force; after that America would win the war. All he asked was, hold out on the West-ern front this year. He protested against embarking on. this Eastern ad-venture, when so dreadful a danger was imminent near to Paris itself. He pro-posed to accept the first part of the Note, and, without in any way questioning Great Britain&apos;s right to engage in a campaign in the East, to reject the second.Baron Sonnino proposed, as it was agreed that no further resources in man-power could be found among the Western Allies, to ask the Ameri-cans what their views on the pro-posed. embodiment of American units in the French and British Armies were: the adoption of this proposal might con-siderably accelerate the usefulness of the American help.
, La, premiere chose, a examiner. serait de: savoir si lep Americains. admettent ce principe de 1&apos;amalgame proyisoire. Cela rnettrait de la lumiere sur la question des effectifs.M. Lloyd George: II ne peut etre question de. prendre en Occident des forces dont le depart mettrait ce front en danger.,11 ne peut etre question non plus d&apos;abandonner nos conquetes en Mesopor tamie et eh Palestine. Peut-etre quel-ques troupes pourraient-elles etre retirees de Salonique: c&apos;estv a examiner. Mais ces changements de quelques divi-sions ne peuvent decider de Tissue de la guerre.Mais les chiffres doimes par le General Betain et le Marechal Haig ont surpris M. Lloyd George (M. Clemenceau dit que le General Petain les liii avait signales depuis longtemps). Eh examinaht le tableau des forces en presence, les chiffres des combattants et des ressources des depots, dans les deux camps, il ne ressort pas une grande inferiorite de notre cote.Une discussion au sujet des ressources americaines amene ]e Genera&apos; Bliss a exposer a combien il estrme qu&apos;il faut evaluer le nombre des divisions ameri-caines instruites a une epoque donnee:D.I.II y a en France actuellement ... 5 Les  Anglais  ont  entrepris detransporter le personnel de ... 6 II arrivera en France, en fevrieret en mars (1^ D.I. par mois)... 3 Les mois suivants 2 divisions parmois, soit jusqu&apos;en septembre...   10Arrivees le ler septembre       ...   24On admet que trois mois d&apos;instruction en France sont necessaires pour que ces D.I. soient utilisables sur le front.Pour connaitre le nombre de divisions utilisables le ler septembre, il n&apos;y a qu&apos;a supprimer le nombre de divisions arrivees dans les trois mois precedents, soit 6, restant 18 divisions.M. Sonnino. .demands- si ce delai d&apos;utilisation suppose ramalgame on non.Mr. Lloyd George, in answer to the last remarks of M. Clemenceau, Urged the Supreme War Council not to lose sight of the.importance of the East, and insisted that, on the figures prepared by the General Staffs, the Allies were in the West taking risks considerably less than had been taken by the Germans on the same front during the war. He asked whether M. Clemenceau proposed we should retire from Jerusalem, Bagdad, and Salonica. He pointed out that we would not get more than two divisions out of the abandonment of the Eastern offensive campaign: that was all even that Sir Douglas Haig hoped for.A general discussion to which Generals Bliss, Pershing, and Petain, and other members of the Supreme War Council contributed, then followed. It was ascertained how the American troops were to be embodied, and at what rate they would become an effective com-batant force.General Bliss explained that the principle on which he calculated his effective combatant forces, after the spring of this year, was to take the total number of American troops on French soil at a given date and to deduct from it the number of troops that had arrived during the three months previous to that date at the rate of two divisions a month. At the end of September he would have 24 divisions on French soil, and 18, there-fore, effective combatant divisions.In order to expedite their training, some of the American troops would be attached as battalion or regimental units to the Allied forces for purposes of train-ing; when undergoing this training they would, of course, do their duty and take part in any engagements in which they might find themselves involved, if judged capable to do so. But,when this period of training was over, they would be assembled in purely American divisions under their own commanders.** Tbe complete statement made by General Bliss is printed as an Annex to this proces-verlal.
Le General Bliss: Les unites seront entrainees au front avec les troupes anglaises et francaises, jusqu&apos;a ce qu&apos;elles puissent etre reunies en divisions.M. Clemenceau affirme que personne ne veut diminuer Fautonomie de 1&apos;Armee americaine.Le General Petain fait remarquer qu&apos;il y a confusion: le General Pershing est d&apos;accord pour Vinstruction avec les troupes alliees, mais n&apos;admet Femploi de ses troupes que par divisions reunies.Le General Pershing precise qu&apos;il s&apos;agit d&apos;instruction, y compris le service dans la tranchee, mais non du combat.Le General Bliss conclut sur ce point particulier en disant: &quot; Quand le moment viendra, les troupes americaines en etat de se battre se battront la oil elles seront; les troupes americaines non en etat de se battre seront remplacees par d&apos;autres.&quot;Personne, d&apos;autre part, ne peut s&apos;etonner du desir de 1&apos;Amerique de reunir ses troupes en divisions a mesure qu&apos;elles sont instruites.&quot;*M. Clemenceau declare ce point regie et propose de remettre au lendemain, 10 heures, F etude du Plan d&apos;Operations.(La seance est remise au lendemain a 10 heures.)(The Meeting adjourned at 6.45 to 10 am. the following day.)* The complete statement made by General Bliss.is printed as an Annex to this proces-verhal.
ANNEX.Statement made by General Tosher H. Bliss before the Supreme War Council at its Second Meeting, Third Session, January 31, 1918, in regard to the Training and Utilisation of American Troops.In regard to the question which had been twice asked by Baron Sonnino as to whether the American Government would allow the minor units of each division to be amalgamated with British and French divisions, in order that they could most effectively perform their part in the emergency which was assumed to be&apos;approaching within the next few months, General Bliss stated in substance as follows : To ask the United States formally to declare now and in advance of the emer-gency that it will permit its units to be amalgamated with British and French divisions is to make unnecessarily difficult the solution of the problem which you are studying, i.e., the most effective utilisation of American man-power under present conditions. Everything possible is now being done to prepare for this effective utilisation of American man-power without the formal declaration by my Govern-ment which Baron Sonnino appears to desire. Yesterday the British Government agreed to bring over six American divisions, with the understanding that the)&quot; would train the infantry battalions of these divisions on the British front. If the German attack finds these battalions on the British front they will fight to the extent of their capacity wherever the attack finds them. Also, General Pershing entered into an agreement with General Petain by which the organisations of his divisions will receive their final training on the French line. It goes without saying that neither our battalions on the British front nor our other organisations on the French front can be withdrawn for the purpose of forming complete American divisions under their own officers while the German attack is being made or is being prepared. If the crisis should come the American troops will undoubtedly be used in whatever way their services will be most effective, either in defence or offence, with the British and French troops with whom they are at the time serving. It is to be clearly under-stood, however, that this training of American units with British and French divi-sions, whether behind the lines or in actual combat on the line, is only a stepping-stone&apos; in the training of the American forces, and that whenever it is proper and practicable to do so these units will be formed into American divisions under their own officers. Such a thing as permanent amalgamation of our units with British and French units would be intolerable to American sentiment.

M. Clemenceau ouvre la seance. II demande la discussion de Y annexe a la Note No. ,12. Cette annexe est lue et adoptee en premiere lecture.En deuxieme lecture les modifications suivantes sont apportees au texte sur la demande de:M. Lloyd George: $ 1. Au lieu de: &quot; en mettant pour un certain temps la superiorite du nombre du cote des Empires centraux,&quot; mettre &quot; accrois-sant dans une proportion menacante les effectifs du cote des Puissances centrales.&quot;regard to Note 12 of the Military Representatives: &quot; The Supreme War Council accepts Note 12 of the Military Representa-tives on the Plan of Campaign for 1918, the British Government having made it clear that, in utilising in the most effective fashion the forces already at its disposal in the Eastern theatre, it has no intention of divert-ing forces from the Western front or in any way relaxing its efforts to maintain the safety of that front, which it regards as a vital interest of the whole Alliance.&quot;This   resolution   was formally con-%ifirmed at a later stage of the meeting  see page 25 below.M. Clemenceau proposed that- the Supreme War Council should commence by discussing the Plan of Campaign for 1918, and drew attention in particular to the annexure to Note 12, which, he said, was an important document.(M. Mantoux then read the Annexure to Note 12.)M. Clemenceau suggested that the best procedure would be to accept the Annexure as a first reading, and then to discuss it in second reading when any necessary amendments could be made.Mr. Lloyd George proposed to delete the following word in paragraph (1): &quot; transferring as it does the superiority of numbers to the side of the Central Powers &quot;;and to substitute the following: &quot; increasing to a menacing extent the numbers on the side of the Central Powers.&quot;Subject -to this he was prepared to agree to the Annexure to Note 12.(This amendment was agreed to.)M. Clemenceau said that this An-nexure constituted a veritable plan of offensive-defensive, including a local counter-offensive leading, if circum-stances should permit, to an extensive and powerful offensive.General Petain said that no offensive could be contemplated unless the effec-tives were forthcoming, and this brought us back once more to the question of man-power.M. Clemenceau said that after the long discussions on the previous day the Supreme War Council could not again enter into the man-power question.   He
n tagreed, however, that when we speak of a great offensive it was necessary to satisfy ourselves as to whether it. was feasible. He himself did not pretend to know the possibilities, but he asked if General Petain would like to move any amendment.Du General Petain: I C.  Au lieu de:      General Petain proposed to omit the &quot; aussi    puissante   et    etendue    que   following words in paragraph (1) (c) on possible,&quot; mettre: &quot;aussi etendue que page 2 of the Annexure:  nos effectifs le permettront.&quot; ::as    extensive    and    powerful    aspossible,&quot;and to substitute the words:  &quot; as far as our effectives permit: &quot;(&quot; aussi etendue que nos effectifs le permettront.&quot;)Field-Marshal Haig and General Robertson agreed to the Annexure to Note 12, subject to General Petain&apos;s amendment.M. Clemenceau called attention to the last paragraph of the Annexure to Note 12, and said that General Foch had sug-gested that the text implied that the Supreme War Council would have no right to take the initiative in making plans. He himself inclined to this view, since the making of plans belonged essen-tially to the functions of the Com-manders-in-Chief and their Staffs. Their plans, however, could be referred to the Supreme War Council. Unless, for example, Field-Marshal Haig and General Petain had disagreed, it would not be necessary to refer their plans to the Supreme War Council.Du Baron Sonnino: Dernier alinea. Au lieu de: &quot; il serait desirable que les Gouvernements fissent adresser,&quot; mettre: &quot; les Gouvernements feront adresser.&quot;Baron Sonnino asked whether the term &quot;it is highly desirable that&quot; was intended to be interpreted in its strict sense or in the sense of &quot; must be.&quot; The question arose as to whether the plans of campaign must necessarily be sent to the Supreme War Council or not.Mr. Lloyd George said that in the con-sideration of this question it must not be assumed that the paragraph applied only to the Commanders-in-Chief in France. Questions might arise as to the action to be taken in Italy. In this case the ques-tion of plans would not be one for Field-Marshal Haig and General Petain. The three Governments and the three armies might all be concerned. It was im-portant not to fetter the plans of the Commanders-in-Chief and their Staffs, but it was provided in the Rapallo Agree-ment that the plans of the various Com-manders-in-Chief should be submitted to the Supreme War Council, which was responsible for their concordance, and

Clemenceau repond qu&apos;en cas de divergence de vues entre les Com-mandants en Chef, le Conseil superieur de Guerre tranche.Le General Petain expose que Finitia-tive de la conduite de la guerre ne peut etre laissee aux Commandants en Chef: les Gouvernements doivent leur fixer le sens general dans lequel ils auront a con-duire leurs operations.consequently they should have power to add plans of their own, if necessary.- M. Clemenceau suggested that the last paragraph of the Annexure should be amended to read as follows: &quot; The Governments will have the plans and schemes sent to the Supreme War Council, which will ensure the co-ordination of this combined action, and will be entitled to take the initiative in any proposals with this object.&quot;(This amendment teas agreed to.)Baron Sonnino proposed to add before the word &quot; entitled &quot; the word &quot;equally.&quot;(This addition was agreed to.)General Cadorna pointed out that decisions would sometimes have to be taken in case of emergency. At present, however, the meetings of the Supreme War Council .only took place once a month, and in fact, two months had elapsed since the last meeting. He asked what the Military Representatives would do if they required an immediate decision from the Supreme War Council in the intervals.M. Clemenceau said that the Supreme War Council would then meet at once. The heads of the Governments would be always ready to go to one or other of the Allied countries if the meeting could not be held in Paris.General Robertson asked what was meant by the term &quot; will assure the co-ordination of action.&quot; There was no one at Versailles who could issue orders, and without doing so how could they assure co-ordination?M. Clemenceau said that, as he under-stood the question, in the case of a divergence of opinion between the three Commanders-in-Chief, who might have two or even three opinions on any par-ticular question, by referring the question to the Supreme War Council you would substitute one mind instead of three.General Petain said that the general conduct of the war must not be left to the several Commanders-in-Chief: for example, general considerations might make it very desirable to attack in Italy and to defend in France, or vice versa. This might not fit in with the plans of the Commander-in-Chief concerned.
There should, therefore, be some general authority which would lay down where to attack and where to defend, when to attack, and when to delay.Discussion sur ce point, a laquelle M. Clemenceau.said he did not think prennent part MM. Lloyd George, he was in disagreement with General Clemenceau, Baron Sonnino, le General Petain. A priori various Commanders-Foch et le General Cadorna. in-Chief who had the same ultimateobject in view would have a tendency to agree. In case of disagreement, how-ever, the Supreme War Council could always meet to take a decision.General Petain said he did not know exactly how Commanders-in-Chief could be expected to agree about general questions. Some decision should come from some higher authority on this point. At this moment, for example, he himself was preparing to act generally on the defensive, but was also getting ready local offensives. He was not qualified, however, to decide whether an offensive should or should not take place on the Italian front. There should be some higher authority on the general conduct of the war, and this was a matter for the Governments.Mr. Lloyd. George said he was in general agreement both with M. Clemen-ceau and General Petain. He could foresee cases when the Supreme War Council might have to intervene. He would give two examples of such. First, in the event of an attack upon the French front, in coincidence with an attack on the British front, the question might arise as to which attack was the more formidable. General Petain might con-sider that the attack on his front was the more serious. At the same time, Field-Marshal Haig might reply that, in his view, the principal effort was being made on his front. This would be a serious matter requiring a decision from some higher authority. His other ex-ample referred to Italy. At this moment there was a divergence of information as to the enemy&apos;s concentration. Our intelligence was that the German con-centration was on the Western front. The Italian intelligence, however, as he understood from Signor Orlando, was that a great concentration was taking place on the Italian front. It would not be fair to expect General Petain to decide, on the Italian information, to send his reserves away to Italy. The Governments must take this responsi-bility. Such questions were matters for the decision of the Supreme War Council.General Petain said that Mr. Llovd George had rather raised the question of[280 J G
the conduct of a battle than the conduct of a war, and these were two separate questions. The conduct of the reserves in the course of an action concerned the conduct of battle. But in regard to the conduct of the war, preliminary decisions governing the plan of campaign ought to be given by the Governments to the Com-manders-in-Chief, indicating&apos; the general lines of the action they were to take: He wished to draw a clear distinction be-tween the conduct of a battle and the conduct of a war.M. Clemenceau: Les Gouvernements M. Clemenceau suggested that the text font aujourd&apos;hui ce que demande le .which the Supreme War Council were General Petain en adoptant un plan adopting would meet General Petain s d&apos;action. views as far as possible.   In Note 12 andits Annexure were set forth on the re-sponsibility of the Governments, the general lines on which they desired the next campaign to be conducted, namely, a general attitude of defensive; the preparation of local offensives, leading, if circumstances permitted, to a great counter-offensive.General Petain repeated that the general conduct of the war pertained to Governments. They must say what the general plan of campaign was to be. The conduct of a battle was a different matter, and that brought us to the question of a great central reserve, which at present did not exist.General Foch then quoted from the scheme of organisation of the Supreme War Council, as approved at Rapallo: &quot; The general war plans drawn up by the competent military authorities are submitted to the Supreme War Council, which, under the high authority of the Governments, ensures their concordance, and submits, if need be, any necessary changes.&apos;&apos;General Petain pointed out that this was supposed to have been the procedure for the last two months. Some arrange-ment was required for getting the plans sent to Versailles.General Cadorna said that all this would be the proper function of an Allied Generalissimo, if such a post existed. If plans were drawn up by the various Commanders-in-Chief it would be for this person to say that one should take the offensive, that another should take the defensive, and where the concentrations of heavy artillery were to be, &amp;c. Since no such person existed, however, it was necessary to substitute some organ instead. He could not see how there could be any other organ than the Supreme War Council.
Cette discussion amene la lecture de la Note collective No. 1 des Representants militaires, qui est adoptee par le Conseil superieur de Guerre.La conclusion de la discussion est donnee par J&apos;adoption du texte des deux resolutions ci-dessous:Resolution 1.Le Conseil superieur de Guerre accepte la Note No. 12 des Representants militaires sur le plan de campagne pour 1&apos;annee 1918, le Gouvernement britan-nique ayant nettement declare qu&apos;en utilisant de la facon la plus efficace les forces dont il dispose deja sur le theatre de guerre oriental, il n&apos;entre pas dans ses intentions de detourner des forces du front occidental, ni de diminuer d&apos;aucune faeori ses efforts pour assurer la securite de ce front, qu&apos;il considere comme etant d&apos;un interet vital pour 1&apos;alliance entiere.Baron Sonnino said that what General Cadorna suggested was precisely what the Supreme War Council were about to do, namely, to give general directions for the 1918 campaign. He thought possibly the matter might be put more clearly in the note. It might be stated that it was the duty of the Supreme War Council to establish some general plan of campaign, and that the general direction of the war would be under the Supreme War Council.M. Clemenceau asked if Baron Son-nino wished to move an amendment.Baron Sonnino replied in the negative.&quot;General Cadorna said that Note 12 only laid down the principles of a cam-paign. A plan of campaign meant much more than this. It must say that there would be an offensive here, and a defens-ive there, and that troops should be moved from one section of the front to another, He conceived this to be the duty of the Supreme War Council.General Wilson reminded the Supreme War Council that the Rapallo Agree-ment gave full powers for what the Supreme War Council had to do. As a result the Military Representatives began by drawing up Note 1, which laid down the general policy for the war in 1918. If the Supreme War Council would endorse that Note thev would have done what General Petain required.(.!/. Mantoux then read, Note 1 by the Permanent Military Representatives.)General Petain agreed with this Note.(Note 1 was approved.)Mr. Lloyd George suggested that, in order to bring this discussion to a head, it was desirable that the Governments represented on the Supreme War Coun-cil should direct their General Staffs and Commanders-in-Chief to prepare their plans of campaign for 1918 on the basis of Notes 1 and 12, and that these should be forwarded to the Supreme War Council.General Petain said that Notes 1 and 12 were quite correct as a basis of what should be done. They expressed certain desiderata, but the Commanders-in-Chief would require further instructions in order to draw up precise plans, and in his view another organ of co-ordination would be required.Lord Milner suggested that Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s resolution would meet the case. General Petain had quite correctly pointed out that the Note only laid down
Resolution 2.Ann d&apos;obtenir la complete coopera-tion pour les plans cooperations en 1918, le Conseil superieur de Guerre declare que les Gouvernements interesses don-neront a leurs Etats-Majors et Gom-mandants en Chef respectifs Finstruc-tion d&apos;etablir leurs plans detailles sur les bases des Notes collectives numeros 1 et 12 et de les envoyer au Conseil superieur de Guerre.the general lines of the policy to be adopted, and that something more was required. This was met by Mr. Lloyd - George&apos;s proposal that the General Staffs and Commanders-ih-Chief should submit their plans. The Supreme War Council, he pointed out, really consisted of the Governments, since it included the Minis-terial Heads of the Governments. &quot;The Notes which the Supreme War Council had before them had been submitted to them by their Permanent Military Repre-sentatives. He suggested, therefore, that the first thing for the Governments to do was to give these Notes their im-primatur.Mr. Lloyd George then proposed the following resolution: &quot; With a view to the complete co-ordination of plans of operation dur-ing 1918 the Supreme War Council agree that the several Governments concerned, shall direct their respective General Staffs and Commanders-in-Chief to submit their detailed plans on the basis of Joint Notes 1 and 12 by the Permanent Military Representa-tives, and shall forward these plans to the Supreme War 001111011.&quot;General Foch said that in order to get co-ordination between the detailed plans, it was necessary that theGovern-ments should give general directions as to the basis of these plans. After these general directions had been received the plans could be made. Plans could only be drawn up by some Inter-Allied organisation, which would consider the ^whole front from Nieuport- to Venice. For this there was required an organ of study and an organ of execution. At present there were no general directions and no plans.Mr. Lloyd George said that this was the object of the Supreme War Council.M. Clemenceau agreed with Mr. Lloyd George, and pointed out that the general directions had been given by the Notes now under consideration.General Weygand said he had no ob-jection to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposal, but that to instruct the Commanders-m-Chief to base their plans on Notes 1 and 12 was, to some extent, a violation of the Agreement of Rapallo, which left the initiative of drawing up plans with the competent military authorities.M. Clemenceau did not consider it necessary to discuss this question.
Le General Robertson expose qu&apos;il est de son devoir de faire observer que par suite de manque de ressources en effectifs, en materiel, en tonnage, et par suite des evenements possibles sur le front occiden-tal, il juge utile de se tenir sur la defen-sive sur les fronts secondaires, et d&apos;en ramener toutes les troupes non neces-saires a cette ligne de conduite.M. Clemenceau prend acte de cette de-claration. II a ete decide que cette aifaire ne regarde que le Gouvernementanglais.General Robertson asked whether Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s resolution applied to Note 12. ./ M. Clemenceau replied in the anirma-tive.General Robertson asked if Note 12 had been approved.M. Clemenceau then read the follow-ing Resolution, which had been agreed to (as stated at the beginning of this Proces-verbal) before the meeting: &quot; The Supreme War Council accepts Note 12 of the Military Representa-tives on the Plan of Campaign for 1918, the British Government having made it clear that, in utilising in the most effective fashion the forces already at its disposal in the Eastern theatre it has no intention of divert-ing forces from the Western front or in any way relaxing its efforts to main-tain the safetv of that front, which it regards as a vital interest of the whole Alliance.&quot;(This Resolution was formally agreed to.) .General Robertson said that he did not agree with some of the statements made in Note 12 of the Military Representa-tives, or with some of the inferences drawn in regard to a campaign against Turkey. He did not want at the moment however, to discuss these in detail. It was not for him to approve or object to anv Resolution of this Council, as he was not a member, but as he was present he felt compelled to make a few observations on the Resolution proposed. In view of the state of the Entente&apos;s resources, espe-cialiy in men and tonnage, and in view of the possible events on the Western front this yesir, he submitted to the Council that they ought to adopt a defensive policy in all secondary theatres, and to keep no more troops there than were necessary for this. He was also of opinion that to undertake, as recom-mended by the Military Representa-tives &quot; A decisive offensive against Turkey, with a view to the annihilation of the Turkish Armies and the collapse of Turkish resistance &quot;w&apos;as not a practical plan, and that to attempt it would be very dangerous and detrimental to our prospects of winning the war.M. Clemenceau suggested that the Supreme War Council should take note of General Robertsons opinion. The question as to whether General Robert-

Clemenceau then asked whether the Supreme War Council would approve Notes Nos. 1, % 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11.(All the above were approved, with the exception of -Joint Note No. 4, on the Balkan problem, which was reserved for more detailed information at the sugges-tion of General Cadorna; Note No. 5, on the situation in Russia, which was merely taken note of; and, Note 11, on Chinese battalions, which was dropped.)Summary of Conclusions.I. Resolutions in regard to the Plan of Campaign during 1918..1. The Supreme War Council accepts Note 12 of the Military Representatives on the Plan of Campaign for 1918, the British Government having made it clear that, in utilising in the most effective fashion the forces already at its disposal in the Eastern theatre, it has no intention of diverting forces from the Western front, or in anv wav relaxing its efforts to maintain the safety of that front, which it regards as a vital interest of the whole Alliance.2. The Supreme War Council approve the Annexure to Joint Note No. 12, sub-ject to the amendments proposed by Mr. Lloyd George (page 1, para. 1), General Petain (page 2, para. 1 (c) ), and M. Cle-menceau (page 2, last para,).3. With a view to the complete co-ordination of plans of operation during 1918, the Supreme War Council agree that the several Governments concerned shall direct their respective General Staffs and Commanders-in-Chief to sub-mi t their detailed plans on the basis of Joint Notes 1 and 12 by the Permanent Military Representatives, and shall for-ward these plans to the Supreme War Council.4. The Supreme War Council approve Joint Note No. 1 of the Permanent Mili-tary Representatives dealing with mili-tary policy.

This Re-serve must be additional to the divisions which each army has behind its owm front. It was also necessary to have some authority to conserve the reserves and to decide when the time has come to use them, to arrange for their transport to the north or south, and to decide all details in conjunction with the comman-ders of the armies to whom they might be sent. To summarise, there must be one authority, able to constitute, conserve, and prepare for the employment of the General Reserve by the various armies, in agreement with the commanders. When the moment arrives to make use of the Reserve the same authority must decide ; on their use, must arrange  for  theirtransport, and feed the battle-line in which the Reserve w^as to be engaged. As the Reserve might be utilised to support any of the Allies, the central authority must be Inter-Allied in character. It must be able and entitled to make all the necessary preparations. Moreover, this Inter-Allied organ must be required to take decisions if the Governments were not in session at Versailles. In fact, it must be an Inter-Ally organ of execution. The only question that arises is as to how this central authority should be consti-; tutecl. If he were asked for a concrete &apos; proposal he would suggest to bring together the Chiefs of the Staff who advise their Governments on the different questions, in order that they might carry out their duties in agreement. To these principal members of the central organ - there should be added representatives of the American Army and of the Belgian Army.Le General Robertson, apres quelques General Robertson said he was in objections de details, ajoute que quel que general agreement with General Foch in

Clemen-ceau, Lloyd George et Orlando.regard to the necessity of creating a General Reserve. The fundamental question, however, was the command of the reserves. If this were settled, the composition of the Reserves would settle itself. He himself doubted the need of the General Reserve at the moment, because most of the Allied troops were needed where thev were, except in Italy. Any day, however, it might be necessary to form the proposed Reserve, and therefore the question of the organisation should be studied in detail. He agreed with General Foch that the best persons to control the Reserve would be the Chiefs of the Staff. This arrangement would perfectly well suit Great Britain and France, but it would not suit Italy so well, as the Italians had no Chief of the Staff, except with the Commander-in-Chief of the Army. He also understood that General Pershing commanded all the American troops in France. The question of the Italian and American re-presentation would want working out in detail, but these minor difficulties could be surmounted. Whoever commands the Reserve must be in a position to issue orders immediately the emergency arises. The central controlling body, however, should interfere as little as possible with the Commanders-in-Chief, who were re-sponsible to their respective Govern-ments. What the central body had to do was to perform those duties which could not be undertaken by the Commander-in-Chief of any one of the fronts.M. Clemenceau said that the Supreme War Council now had a definite propo-sition before them, namely, that the com-mand of the reserves should be given to the Chiefs of Staff. He pointed out, however, that the Chiefs of Staff are not constantly in the same place, and that the reserves were scattered about in various places. The question, therefore, arose&apos; how to provide for the prompt decisions that would be required.General Cadorna said that however the directing organisation was composed, it would not have to undertake a definite act of command. It would merely have the duty of saying whether the Reserve was to be sent to the British, French, or Italian front, where it was to be concen-trated, and which Army it was to rein-force. Once the reserves had been sent to one or other of the Armies, they would pass under the command of the Comman-der-in-Chief of that Army. In fact, the function of the central body would be a very simple one.
General Petain expressed agreement with General Cadorna.General Foch pointed out that the cen-tral body would have to deal with re-serves of several nationalities. The ques-tion arose, therefore, as to whether the whole Reserve could be under one com-mand. The Inter-Allied body would have the duty of saying how it was to be employed.M. Clemenceau said at the moment he did not want to discuss the question, but merely to know what was intended. In the conditions proposed by General Cadorna and supported by General Petain, he did not understand of what the Inter-Allied Reserve would consist. He understood that each General would have a reserve of his own; for example, there would be French, British. Italian, and American reserves. In this scheme he did not see how the great army of re-serves which he wanted was to be created. He did not want to discuss the question for the moment from a military point of view, but merely from one of common sense. If each General had the free dis-position of his own reserves what would happen? When one General was attacked he would gradually use up his reserves until there were none left. In the meanwhile, the General Commanding the adjacent Army might have the whole of his reserves in hand. Hence, a situa-tion of great danger might arise. When the question of creating an Inter-A Hied Reserve had been raised it had been with the idea that, as we could not have a single Commander-in-Chief, such as a Plannibal or a Charlemagne, we might at least have a Commander of Reserves. He considered it very desirable that we should build up an Army Reserve which could be sent to any point where it would be useful.General Cadorna said he feared he had not made himself sufficiently clear. His opinion was the same as that of M. Cle-menceau in regard to the creation of a great Reserve. Suppose that a great attack were made by the enemy against the French front. Then the central body would decide that reserves were to be sent to that front. Once they had arrived these reserves would be entirely under the command of the French Com-mander-in-Chief. He then took another hypothesis, namely, that there were two attacks, one in France and one in Italy. The central body would then only decide^ the point to which the reserves were to be sent, how many to Italy and how many to France.    Another duty of the central
body would be, when the time had arrived, to recall the reserves and form them up for another emergency. The reserves allocated to the central body, though remaining behind each separate Army, would be at the disposal of the central organisation, which would decide when and where they were to be employed.Mr. Lloyd George said that, like M. Clemenceau, he was at the stage of ask-ing questions and not of discussing the merits of the scheme. He asked himself whether, supposing those in charge of the Reserve decided on a counter-offen-sive, would the new central body have the power to plan and direct it ?General Foch replied in the affirma-tive.General Petain expressed himself in agreement with General Cadorna, and reinforced his argument, taking another example on a somewhat lower scale. Sup-posing, he suggested, that on the French front he had fifteen divisions in reserve. If a sector of his front were attacked the duty of the French-Commander-in-Chief would be to put some of the fifteen divi-sions at the disposal of the Commander of that part of the line which was attacked. It would then be entirely for the Commander of that Army to decide what to do with them. Similarly, the essential role of the supreme central body would be to allot the reserves to one or other Commander-in-Chief. Of course, the Commander-in-Chief had other duties to perform, which would not per-tain to the proposed central body, but in regard to the reserves their functions were precisely similar. The same prin-ciple applied to the offensive. If in the French Army it was decided to make an offensive at some point, the Commander-in-Chief would allot, say, ten divisions for that purpose. When the operation was concluded the Commander-in-Chief would withdraw these divisions. The functions of the central body in regard to an offensive would be precisely similar.Signor Orlando suggested that when General Petain talked of the reserves being disposed of by the new central bod)&apos; he understood that this did not apply to the reserves at the disposal of particular Armies. He understood that each Army would continue to have its own reserves in addition to those under the Inter-Allied central body.General Petain replied, in the affirma-tive. The idea was to constitute an Inter-k

Des Commandants en Chef lui parait le meilleur organe.Allied Reserve in addition to the local reserves of the Armies.Mr. Lloyd George suggested that it was difficult to consider this question unless a specific proposal was formu-lated.General Bliss said that, in the presence of so many officers with long experience in the present war, he, who had as yet but little experience, spoke with some defer-ence. He had, however, observed abso-lute unanimity of opinion on the desira-bility of creating a Reserve if sufficient troops could be found. This involved a considerable reduction of the strength of the various Armies. It was clear that someone must decide whether there are sufficient disposable troops for the crea-tion of a Reserve, and this at once raised the question of the command. Each national Army must have its own Re-serve, and the commander of each national Army must, at the outset, have all the troops under his command, as he did not know where the attack would come. If any particular Army were attacked, the Conunander-in-Chief would gradually put in all his reserves until they were exhausted. It would seem to follow that, at a certain point, you might be able to sav definitelv that this was the point on which the enemy was concen-trating his main attack. When the Com-inander-in-Chief had exhausted his own resources reserves would have to be brought up from another national Army. The question would eventualh&quot; arise when those armies which had not been attacked would still dispose of consider-able reserves. General Robertson had suggested that a great step forward would be taken if the question of the command could be decided, as the person selected would then decide on the strength of the Reserve and whence it was to be drawn. General Robertson had also said that it would not be necessary to form the Reserve at the present moment. But it did seem necessary to decide now whence the Reserve was to be drawn. If the Commandersrin-Chief could agree on a single man to command all the reserves, that would be by far the best plan. But to select a single man might prove impossible, and some other solution would have to be found. The question was not so much one of com-mand as of control. He reached the con-clusion that the only body that would command confidence would be one com-posed of a group of men who represented the various Commanders-in-Chief. When the representatives of the Commanders-
in-Chief were in agreement he presumed that the Commanders-in-Chief them-selves would be in agreement and perfect harmony would be preserved.M. Lloyd George demande que Ton dis-cute sur un texte.M.

La seance est interrompue de 16 heures 45 a 17 heures 5.A la reprise de la seance, lecture est doniiee du pro jet ci-dessous :Projet de Resolution.1Q En vue d&apos;assurer la coordination des operations militaires, conformement -aux directives des Gouvernements, sur tout le front s^etendant de la mer du Nord a 1&apos;Adriatique, il est cree une Direction superieure de la Guerre.2Q Cette Direction comprend les Chefs fFEtats-Majors generaux francais et anglais, ainsi que des officiers Generaux representant lTtalie, rAmerique,&quot; et la Belgique.

In any offensive operation the use of reserves would be involved. He wished to know how far the central body would have control of the Reserve for offensive purposes. He was apprehensive that the control of all offensive operations might be placed in the hands of the cen-tral body, thus depriving the British, French, Italian, and American Comman-ders-in-Chief of the initiative they ought, to possess.(At this point the Supreme War Coun-cil ad]ourned in order that General Foch might prepare his draft)On reassembling Professor Mantoux read the following draft hj General Foch : Draft Resolution.1. A Superior War Board is created to secure the co-ordination of military operations, in accordance with the general instructions of the Governments, over the whole front from the North Sea to the Adriatic.2. The members of this Board are the French and British Chiefs of the General Staffs, and also Generals representing Italy, America, and Belgium. It sits in Paris.3. This Board draws up, in agreement with the Commanders-in-Chief, the general plans of operations. These plans can be proposed either by the Board or the Commanders-in-Chief.4. The powers and duties of the Board include (a.) The constitution of General Re-serves.For this purpose the Commanders-in-Chief receive, according to circum-stances, the instructions of the Board with regard to the troops required for the General Reserves, the places where

The maintenance and movement of the General Reserves.For this purpose the Commanders-in-Chief must, in accordance with the in-structions of the Board, take all neces-sary measures for the transportation and concentration of the troops constituting the General Reserves. These measures are submitted to the Board for approval.(c.) The use of the General Reserves.Their use will have been settled in a. plan adopted by the Board in agreement with the Commanders-in-Chief. As soon as active operations begin, the Chiefs of the General Staffs are present, as much as possible in Paris, together with the officers representing the other countries. They have full powers to take decisions in the name of their Governments.Signor Orlando said that he saw grave difficulties in regard to the application of this scheme to Italy, owing to the diffi-culties. of the military organisation which were, to some extent, constitu-tional. He observed that in the text of the document care had been taken to dis-tinguish between Great Britain and France, which were to be represented by the Chiefs of the Staff, and Italy, which was to be represented by a General. The fact was that Great Britain and France both had a Chief of Staff, as well as a Commander-in-Chief, but Italy only had a Commander-in-Chief and no Chief of the Staff. The question would be asked : Why should Italy not nominate a special officer ? But the question of the powers of this officer presented difficulties. Of course, he could be accorded special powers, but, nevertheless, he w*ould not have so authoritative a status as the others. How could he give orders to his Commander-in-Chief, whose representa-tive he was ? It was true that the term &quot; instructions &quot; was used, and not &quot; orders,&quot; but the instructions would practically amount to orders. In the British and French Armies this difficulty did not arise, because the Chief of the General Staff did, in fact, issue instruc-tions. But in Italy no one could give instructions to the Commander-in-Chief.
M. Lloyd George expose 1&apos;imppssibilite pour les Chefs d&apos;Etats^Majprs autres que le General Foeh de se reunir souvent a Paris. II faut reflechir avant de se de-cider sur une question&apos; aussi grave et se contenter ce soir d&apos;une premiere lecture.Le Baron Sonnino signale la contradic-tion qu&apos;il y a entre ce texte et les deci-sions prises le matin au sujet des pou-voirs du Conseil superieur de Guerre. L&apos;organe dont on propose la creation sup-planterait les Gouvernements et le Con-seil superieur de Guerre. II est neces-saire que cet organe soit permanent, et le siege a Paris est une difficulte.- Mr. Lloyd George said that Signor Orlando&apos;s observations emphasised the importance of seeing the actual proposal before accepting it. The general prin-ciple of the proposal had already been agreed to, but everything depended on how it was worked out. He did not think that, seeing this proposal for the first time, he could express a decision in regard to it, but he would like to make a few observations. It appeared to him that the proposal was entirely incon-sistent with the Resolutions which had already been passed on the same day. It had been decided in the morning that the plans of the Commanders-in-Chief were to be submitted to the Supreme War Council and approved- by the various Governments there. This, however, was a plan to get round this decision. Conse-quently, some alteration would have to be made in the proposal in this respect. Another difficulty which he foresaw was that whatever body was created would have to be located at Paris. This was quite convenient for General Foch, who was already located at Paris. For General Robertson, however, who was located in London, this was a difficulty. General Robertson had the duty of ad-&apos; vising the War Cabinet in London, and they would not be willing for consider-able periods to put up with some officer of lower status. In fact, we were in almost the same difficultv as Italy. Hence he proposed merely to make a first read-ing of the proposal, and then to adjourn the question until to-morrow.Baron Sonnino concurred in Signor Orlandos and Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s criti-cisms. This new Central Direction would entirely supplant the new organisation agreed&quot; to in the morning by the Supreme War Council. Only this morning it had been agreed that the plans would be laid before the Governments at the Supreme War Council. Here, however, the plans were to be proposed by the Chiefs of Staff. He wished to know how the dele-gates of England, France, Italy, Bel-gium, and the United States would take their decisions. . Would it be by voting and a majority ? This he could not agree to. Wouid they have to reach unanimous agreement? This must be more clearly defined.In regard to the constitution of the Reserve, he thought that a decision should be taken by the Supreme War Council.As regards the idea that the seat of the new central body should be at Paris, Mr. Lloyd George had already put the
M. Clemenceau trouve ces objections determinantes. II ne peut admettre un organisme qui se substituerait a ce qui existe et prendrait les pouvoirs qui doi-vent rester entre les mains du Conseil superieur de Guerre.(La discussion continue sur ce sujet.)objections that the British Chief of the General Staff could not sit permanently there. The same applied to Italy in a greater degree, since a journey of thirty-six hours instead of ten hours was in-volved. In his view the new proposals ran entirely counter to what had been decided by the Supreme War Council the same morning, and too much of the text was new.M. Clemenceau said that the objections of Mr. Lloyd George and Baron Sonnino appeared to him to be determining. He himself was not prepared to discuss a new- text like this without time to con-sider it. He foresaw, however, that it would be very difficult to get a formula for the new organisation. He wished to ensure the preservation of the continuity of the proposals already agreed to. In-stead of discussing the new proposal point by point, he suggested that it would be better, before to-morrow, to try and discover a short formula to cover the administration of the Reserve. It did not enter into the minds of him and his colleagues to deprive the Commanders-in-Chief of any of their powers any more than it entered into the minds of the sol-diers to deprive the statesmen of their powers. He hoped that before to-morrow a simple and short formula would be dis-covered to avoid discussion of these details.Signor Orlando said that he had a suggestion to make, not formally, but merely for reflection before the meeting on the following day. In constituting the authority to administer the General Reserve it was absolutely essential to have a body that, on the one hand, had the power to issue instructions, and, on the other hand, was in immediate con-nection with the Governments. He asked why the Military Committee at Ver-sailles, who are beginning to create a tradition of their own, and are in direct touch with their Governments, should not form the nucleus of this body, to which might be added the four Chiefs of the Staff in agreement with the Coni-manders-in-Chief. Difficulties might arise in securing agreement, but in emer-gency the Generals would, as a rule, pro-bably agree. If, however, they did not agree, then the political Supreme War Council must be called in. He admitted the proposal was open to the objection that it was not a very speedy method.General Cadorna pointed out that cases of urgency might arise when there would be no time to call together the

Lloyd George la resume en disant qu&apos;on a propose trois alternatives:&apos; Mettre le commandement des Reserves entre les mains soit des Chefs d&apos;Etats-Majors generaux, soit des Representants militairea agissant au nom des Chefs d&apos;Etats-Majors generaux, soit d&apos;officiers delegues specialement a Versailles par chaque Gouvernement avec un pouvoir executif.Supreme War Council. In the case of the Italian retreat on the Upper Isonzo, for instance, General Foch had taken a very rapid decision, and had sent the first of the French divisions within twenty-four hours of the incident. He suggested that in such cases the Military. Representatives should have powers to take the decision and to act as delegates of their Government.Signor Orlando said that this was in accord with his ideas.Mr. Lloyd George said that another suggestion that had been made was that in this emergency the Government should delegate someone to come to Paris and sit with the French Prime Minister to take the decision. For example, he himself might delegate to Lord Milner the neces-sary powers.Baron Sonnino, while admitting that the Prime Minister could, of course, dele-gate if he wished, suggested that it was not necessary to establish this in any formal document.Mr. IAoyd George agreed that it was unnecessary to include it in a Resolution. He would like his colleagues to consider before the next day the following alterna-tive proposals for the composition of a central directing body : 1. A directing body composed of the Chiefs of Staff of the various nations.2. Signor Orlandos proposal that it should be composed of the Military Representatives, assisted by the Chiefs of Staff in agreement with the Commanders-in-Chief.3. All the Governments, except the French Government, which resides at Paris, should appoint a General ad hoc attached to Versailles. This latter suggestion was made because the bod3^ controlling the Reserve must be in immediate touch with all the information which exists, and Versailles was convenient for this purpose.Baron Sonnino suggested that the Per-manent Military Representatives at Ver-sailles had all the information that was required.Mr. Lloyd George- pointed out that the difficulty was that the Permanent Mili-tary Representatives had no executive functions, and were purely advisory. This new body, however, would have to be executive.M. Clemenceau made another sugges-tion. The new body would not be entirely

Paris and Ver-sailles were, he suggested, too far from the seat of war. Consequently, the new body should sit and take action when convenient at some point nearer to the front.Baron Sonnino agreed that the new body should have the power of moving about in order to ascertain the situation on the spot, and that its executive powers would be limited to the movement of reserves. Once the Reserve divisions had been sent to Italy or France the cen-tral body would have nothing executive to do, and should at once come away.Signor Orlando agreed in this pro-posal, and considered that it would be a danger for the new central body to remain at a point on the front, as they would tend to interfere with the powers of the Commander-in-Chief.M. Clemenceau agreed. The only object of his proposal was a prompt decision after ascertaining the facts.Mr. Lloyd George said it must be re-membered that the new central body Would be connected with the movements of an Inter-Allied Reserve, and conse-quentry it must not be associated with any particular War Office. If it were in Paris it would be difficult to avoid such association. Consequently it should be connected with some Inter-Allied bodv, such as Versailles.Baron Sonnino said that it seemed to be agreed that the new bod)- must be associated with Versailles, and must have the power of moving about.M. Clemenceau said that the first read-ing of the proposal for the constitution of an Inter-Allied Reserve would be re-garded as closed, and the second reading would be taken to-morrow.Italian Co-operation on  the   Western Front.Mr. Lloyd George said that now that we had decided on the constitution of a General Reserve, the question arose how it was to be obtained. He wished to recognise that General Pershing and General Bliss had met the Allies very handsomely in regard to the employment of American troops. He wished, how-ever, now to call attention to the question .of Italy. We and the French had to-gcther no less than 11 divisions in Italy. Apart from their material support, he thought it was a good thing that the British and French troops should fight side by side with the Italian troops for
the defence of Italy. It helped the moral of the troops of both countries that they should be fighting side by side. This was equally true of British and French troops. They would feel encouraged if Italian troops were fighting side by side with them on the Western front. They would feel that they were fighting a common battle, and not each his own battle. He wished to see British, French, Italian, and American troops fighting the battle of humanity on the Western front, though, as he pointed out, America was far enough away from the seat of the war to be indifferent to a German ad-vance of 40 kilom., or so, which was not the case with any of their European co-belligerents. Hence, before coming to the question of the extension of the British line, or the creation of the reserves, he suggested, if his Italian colleagues would consent, that we ought to discuss the question of bringing Italian troops to the Western front. The alternative was to bring the British and French troops from the Italian to the Western front. This, however, was un-desirable from the point of view of moral. Hence, it would be better to bring Italian troops here.He then drew attention to the figures in the tables prepared by the Allied Staffs for the Supreme War Council, pointing * out that on the Italian front there were 1,440,000 Allies, compared with 860,000 enemy combatants, a superiority of 580,000 combatants; whereas, on the French front the Allied superiority was only 164,000. Moreover, the movement of enemy troops was at present towards the French rather than towards the Italian front. Hence, he suggested that the Italians should send eleven divisions to the Western front, who should be available as part of the Central Reserve.M. Orlando adhere, en principe, cha- Signor Orlando said that Mr. Lloyd leureusement a cette proposition.

When General Foch had come to Rome on the question of military labour he had replied that he would like to give him all the men that could possibly be spared.

Sonnino fait remarquer que le front italien ne doit pas etre trop affaibli de troupes en raison des effectifs ennemis qui s&apos;y trouvent, des ressources in-terieures de FAutriche et de la possibilite pour cette Puissance de ramener bientot de nouvelles forces du front russo-roumain.draw the British and French divisions. When it came to the practical execution of the proposal, however, he thought that the new authority should be entrusted with the study of the question.    This matter was closely connected with the question   of  finding   and   utilising  a General Allied Reserve.  Hence, it must be examined and measured by technical experts from this point of view.   It was true that the difference of the numbers of the enemy and the Allies on the Italian front was considerably greater than on the French front.     The docu-ment submitted to the Supreme War Council allowed for forty-seven enemy divisions on the Italian front, though the Italian Staff estimated the number as fifty divisions.    He did not, however, wish to dwell on this aspect of the question.     When the Italian numbers came to be considered it was necessary to bear in mind that some of the divisions required time to be reconstituted after the disaster on the Isonzo.   These ought not to be reckoned on as immediately ready.   Later on, however, it was hoped that they would be fully available.   He also wished to  draw attention to the technical question of the different con-ditions on the Italian and the Anglo-French front. The latter was very strong and fully prepared.   The Italian front was only recently established and con-solidated.   Moreover, owing to the shape of the frontier, any attack on the left flank was most dangerous.   A defeat on the Anglo-French front merely meant a retreat  over  a few kilometres, but a retreat on the Italian left flank meant a very serious and difficult retreat for a great part of  the  army.    For these reasons, while accepting the proposal in principle, he wished it to be studied by the new body.Baron Sonnino wished to add one further consideration. No doubt the Italians had a certain superiority over the enemy in effectives, but the Austrian resources in reserves were much greater than the Italian. Moreover, a peace between the enemy and Roumania and the Ukraine would release a very large force against Italy. The communica-tions of the enemy were very easy, and the whole of the Austrian force could soon, be brought to the Italian front. This must be borne in mind in consider -ing any question of taking troops from Italy.Mr. Lloyd George pointed out that the enemy troops released from the Russian and Roumanian fronts could, with equal ease, be brought to the Western front.

Orlando s&apos;en rap-porte a la decision de 1&apos;organe a, creer, mais il ne doit pas cacher que le General Petain lui a deja demande de faire reve-nir un certain nombre de D.I. dTtalie.Moreover, the Hungarian Prime Minister had only recently declared publicly that Austro-Hungarian troops would be sent to the Western front.M. Clemenceau summed up the remarks of Signor Orlando and Baron Sonnino in the sense that the Italian Government would leave the decision to the new central authority to be created to-morrow.He then said it was his duty not to conceal the fact that some weeks ago General Petain had asked for the with-drawal of two divisions from Italy, partly because the position in some parts of the French line was weak, and partly because France had 135,000 men in Italy compared with Great Britain&apos;s 98,000. Of course, nothing had been decided, but it was possible that General Petain might press for it again. Possibly also, the British might press for the release of one division. In this connec-tion a new fact that had arisen since the previous day was that a further German division had appeared on the -Western front, making a total of 172 German divisions. He wished to point out that all these questions were closely connected, such as, for example, the creation of reserves, the proposed extension of the British line in France, and the employ-ment of Italian troops.(Seance remise au 2 fevrier, a 10 (The Supreme War Council then heures.) adjourned until the following day.)

Lloyd George constate qu&apos;apres avoir examine separement la solution qu&apos;il convient de donner a cette question, les Representants militaires des Puis-sances alliees sont d&apos;accord sur les points principaux; a savoir : qu&apos;il n&apos;est pas sou-liaitable de creer une organisation nou-velle puisque le Conseil superieur de Guerre existe; qu&apos;il est desirable que le General Focli en raison de son experience et de tout son passe puisse faire partie de ^organisation deja constitute (les objec-tions relatives aux autres Chefs d&apos;Etat-Maior conservent d&apos;ailleurs toute leur valeur); que la meilleure solution est de creer un comite oil TAngleterre, lTtalie, TAmerique seront representees par leurs Generaux Representants militaires et la Prance par le General Foch, a crai la proximite de Paris permet d&apos;etre present a. ce comite.II y a lieu de completer le document anglais deja prepare par certaines idees du document americain qui ont une seri-euse valeur; ces idees sont empruntees au 5 3 du document americain.II est desirable que ce comite ait un president pour diriger la discussion et preparer les decisions. II n3y a aucun nom inscrit dans 1&apos;acte de constitution du comite, ma is les membres des differents Gouvernements Tont designe d5un avis unanime, c&apos;est celui du General Foch. Nul doute que les Generaux aniericains s&apos;y rallient. Ce nom inspire a tous les Allies une entiere confiance a cause de la science militaire et de Texperience du General Foch. et peut-etre plus encore parce quhl est un soldat dont la loyaute cnvers 1&apos;Alliance s&apos;est affirmee au cours de cette guerre.Les Anglais n&apos;oublient pas son role en 1914 au cours des circonstances difficiles traversees par les armees anglaises dans les Flandres.Pour lTtalie, il a agi de menie des qivelle a couru un danger; nous savons que si lTtalie ou les Flandres souffrent, ce sera pour le General Foch comme si la France elle-meme souffrait.M.

They had now before them a paper by General Bliss, as well as a set of Resolutions diafted by Mr. Lloyd George. He pro-posed to take General Bliss&apos;s paper first. (M. Mantoux then read Gene-ral Bliss&apos;sNote, which is printed as an Annex tothis proces-verbal.)Mr. Lloyd George said that it had been decided at the Meeting on the previous evening that each member of the Supreme War Council should study separately the various suggestions that had been put forward in regard to the General Reserve. The several texts sub-mitted were now before them, and it was gratifying to find that they, had all arrived separately at the same conclu-sion. He was very glad that so compli-cated a problem had been solved satisfac-torily by general agreement. His own view was that it was undesirable to create an entirely new body. The Supreme War Council, with its Military Representatives, existed, and the exist-ing machinery could be utilised for the purpose in hand. The question before them was, how was this problem of the Central Reserve to be dealt with. He found that they were all in agreement, that General Foch should represent the French Armies on this new body. This decision in no way reflected upon General We)*gand, whose ability and energy were conspicuous. General Foch, however, had exceptional qualities and experience. The heads of the Allied Governments on the Council would have been pleased to have all the various General Staffs repre-sented, but it was quite impossible for the United States to send over their Chief of the Staff to France, and it was equally impossible for Italy and Great Britain to spare their Chiefs of the Staff to sit permanently in Versailles or in Paris, as they were the chief military advisers to their several Governments. Moreover, in particular, when a great battle was in progress, these Chiefs of the Staff should be at their respective posts. They had therefore arrived at the opinion that the best thing to do was to make use of the existing body, with General Foch representing the French instead of General Weygand. As regards the text of the Resolution which the Council had to pass, M. Clemenceau had expressed the wish that it should be as brief as possible. The draft now pro-posed- fulfilled that condition. At the same time, there was something which he
should like to add to it. . He had read General Bliss&apos;s paper, and he suggested that certain portions of it, with one or two alterations, should be engrafted upon his own draft resolutions. Referring to draft resolution 3 of General Bliss&apos;s paper, he suggested that the words &quot;after approval by the majority of its mem-bers &quot; should be eliminated. He would, however, like to see the words &quot; the moment the Reserve or any part of it shall have begun to move, it will come under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief to whose assistance it is assigned &quot; inserted in the final resolution. He also thought it important that the following sentence should also be included in the final resolution, viz. : &quot; Until such move-raent begins the General Reserve will for all purposes of discipline, instruction, and administration be under the orders of the respective Commanders-in-Chief, but no movement could be ordered except by the Committee.&quot;Sir Douglas Haig expressed his con-cnrrence in this suggestion.M. Clemenceau put it to the Council that they should accept Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s draft resolutions with the above additions.Mr. Lloyd George stated that there was another point he wished to raise. He thought it very desirable that as the pro-posed Committee was to have executive powers it should have a President. Some members of the Supreme War Council desired to insert the name of the Presi-dent in the text which constitutes the body, but his own view was that it was best not to insert the name. It was pre-ferable that the Supreme War Council should nominate the President. The President of the Committee must neces-sarily have special qualifications, and the members of the Supreme War Council had agreed that is to say, the three heads of Governments attending that meeting had agreed, and in the absence of the President of the United States had ventured to assume the latter&apos;s concur-rence that the right man to be Presi-dent was General Foch, on account of his experience, his record and his energy, his accomplishments and his reputation.General Bliss said he was sure that the three Prime Ministers were right in assuming that President Wilson would acquiesce in this suggestion.Mr. Lloyd George went on to give the reasons why he and his colleagues had come to this decision.

Orlando s&apos;associe chaudement aux paroles de M. Lloyd George.loyal not only to France but also to the Allies. When the British Army in Flanders was in difficulties he threw all his weight into rendering it assistance. So prompt and generous was that assist-ance that General Foch might almost have been an Englishman himself. Again when Italy was in trouble General Foch, without any hesitation and on his own responsibility, decided to send troops to her aid. General Foch therefore commanded the confidence not only of the French but also of the British and Italians, and, he was glad to hear, the Americans. They could be quite sure that as President of the Committee General Foch would be quite unbiassed. He had, therefore, great pleasure in announcing this decision of the Supreme War Council.General Bliss said that, speaking on behalf of the American Section of the Supreme War Council, and also on behalf of the United States of America, he could say that General Foch was marked out for this important work by his great name, if for no other reason.General Pershing said that he had hoped that perhaps General Robertson&apos;s name might have been included in the composition of this body. His own pro-gramme of that body had, indeed, in-eluded him, but after hearing what Mr. Lloyd George had said about General Robertson^ great ability and experience being wanted elsewhere he was per-suaded that the inclusion of General Robertson was not practicable. He re-gretted the fact, because Sir William Robertson&apos;s name carried very consider-able weight both with the United States and with her soldiery. If the Supreme War Council were satisfied that the Per-manent Military Representatives would have time to perform the very important functions allotted to them in addition to their ordinary duties, then he agreed that the new body should be charged with the work of controlling the reserves.M. Clemenceau expressed his thanks to Generals Bliss and Pershing for what they had said. He wished also to take this opportunity of expressing the admiration and gratitude with which the French Army and the French nation felt towards Sir William Robertson, who was undoubtedly one of the greatest soldiers of this great war.Signor Orlando said that he had heard with emotion what Mr. Lloyd George had stated concerning General Foch&apos;s record

As re-gards the question of the communication of orders, these would be issued by the member of the body nominated by the Supreme War Council.Sir Douglas Haig asked that the exact position should be made clear to him in writing, as it involved a change in con-stitutional procedure.M.

Clemenceau suggested   that   the finitif de la resolution touchant la con-   draft resolutions should now be read, stitution et le maniement d&apos;une Reserve generale.(Professor Mantoux then read the following draft resolutions.)1. The Supreme War Council decides on the creation of General Reserves for the whole of the armies on the Western, Italian, and Balkan fronts.2. The Supreme War Council delegates to an executive composed of the Perma-nent Military Representatives of Great Britain, Italy, and the United States of America, with General Foch, the follow-ing powers to be exercised in consulta-
tion with the Commanders-in-Chief of the armies concerned: (a.) To determine the strength in all arms and composition of the Central Reserves, and the contribution of each national army thereto .(&amp;.) To select the localities in which the Central Reserves are normally to be stationed.(c.) To make arrangements for their transportation and concentration in the different areas.(d.) To decide and issue orders as to the time, place, and period of em-/ployment of the Central Reserves.(e.) To determine the time, place, and strength of the counter-offensive, and then to hand over to one or more of the Comnianders-in-Chief the neces-sary troops for the operation.3. In case of irreconcilable differences of opinion on a point of importance con-nected with the Central Reserves, any Military Representative has the right to appeal to the Supreme War Council.4.

As the resolution stood it looked as if the orders were always to be given by one man. The intention was, however, he understood, that in each several case one man would be designated to give orders.General Bliss suggested that the orders would not be given, but merely trans-mitted.(This was agreed to.)(Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s resolutions, amended as above, were formally agreed to.)M. Clemenceau, after having consulted the members of the Supreme War Council, declares that General Foch had been designated as President of the Executive Committee for the General Reserve.M. Clemenceau said that the next question which had to be decided by the Supreme War Council was that of the extension of the British front. (Joint Note No. 10 of the Permanent Military Representatives). He thought that this question could be decided without any very lengthy discussion. The Military Representatives had arrived unanimously at a certain conclusion, and it remained for the Supreme War Council to ratify what the Versailles Body had agreed upon after much deliberation. He suggested that the Supreme War Council should sanction the adoption of the above Joint Note, leaving it to Sir Douglas Haig and General Petain to decide when and how effect could be given to the recommendations contained in that Note, having regard to the position so far as effectives were concerned.Sir Douglas Haig said that before the Joint Note was accepted he wished to point out that requests from the French for an extension of the British front had &quot;been numerous. He had always met each request with a desire to comply with it if he possibly could. It was in this spirit that he had constantly had to deal with small rectifications of the line when a

Again in 1917, at General Nivelle&apos;s request, he had ex-tended the British front, although by so doing British divisions were deprived of the necessary time for training, and the British Army was compelled thereby to play a secondary role in the spring cam-paign of last year. Lastly, during the recent battle in Flanders, he had at General Petain&apos;s request agreed to, and had now extended the front first to the Oise and afterwards to Barisis, although his troops were in great need of rest and training after the severe fighting they had been through, and notwithstanding he had also to detach divisions to Italy. Owing to the shortage of men and the apparent impossibility of getting the numbers he wanted, he had to face a re-duction in the numbers of the divisions under his command. The position as regards man-power was exactly as set forth in the statement he had submitted on the 30th January. If, as was possible, the enemy attacked in force, he had to face a possible loss of half a million men. This must mean that by the end of Octo-. ber the British force will have sunk toabout 35 divisions. With the effectives at present at his disposal it &quot;was impos-sible for him to extend his front beyond the point that he had agreed upon with General Petain. The extra front he was now7 asked to take over presented other difficulties with regard to transportation. Many additional men would be required to construct and operate new railways. With the utmost desire to comply in every way possible with the French de-mancls, he felt bound to point out to the Supreme War Council that with the troops now at his disposal it was quite out of the question for him to take over any more front.M.

M. Lloyd George expose les raisons militaires et politiques qui s&apos;opposent a une extension du front actuel. Raisons militaires: Grande importance du front anglais a cause des points vitaux qui en sont a petite distance, mines; nceuds de chemins de fer, ports. Raisons politiques: mauvais effet produit en Angleterre par le fait que les soldats anglais n&apos;ont qu&apos;une permission que tous les quinze mois, alors que les soldats francais en ont une tous les quatre mois. II y a en permanence 350,000 Francais en permission et seulement 70,000 Anglais.II prendrait done a regret une telle mesure. II renouvelle son appel au Gouvernement italien pour T envoi sur le front franco-britannique de troupes italiennes. II y aura lieu de soumettre cette question au nouveau comite.cision, mais en s&apos;en rapportant aux considerable extension. It had been Generaux en Chef pour leur execution,   then decided that this question should bethen referred to the Versailles body, and the recommendations of the Military Representatives was that the point of junction between the British forces and the French forces should be on the left bank of the Aillette and between the Aillette and the Laon-Soissons road, the exact point to be fixed by the Com-manders-in-Chief. This recommendation had been made by the Military Repre-sentatives in possession of full knowledge of the comparative reserves of both the French and British armies in men. Field-Marshal Haig maintained that it was impossible for him to make this further&apos; extension of his front on account of his diminishing man-power. The French reserves and personnel, however, suffered from the same disability. General Petain hoped, therefore, that the recommenda-tions of the Military Representatives would be ratified. He agreed that the execution and method of carrying out this extension should be left to the two Commanders-in-Chief.Mr. Lloyd George asked that before the Joint Note was adopted he might be allowed to put before the Supreme War Council certain very serious considera-tions. The Field-Marshal had said that he could hardly be held responsible for the security of his front if he had to ex-tend his line. He had pointed out that the most vital parts of the Allied fronts were held by the British. The British lines of communication ran parallel to their front, and the enemy were onlv ten miles of!; this constituted a very danger-ous situation. Further, an advance of a few kilometres by the Germans on the French front would not be a very grave matter. If, however, the Germans advanced only six miles in Flanders they would deprive us of certain valuable coal mines, which at present provide no less than ten million tons of coal a year. If they were deprived of this supply of coal it would have to be made up by Great Britain. This would mean a large diversion of labour to&apos;the coal mines, and of tonnage for the transportation of coal across the Channel. The second point - was partly military and partly politicalin character. The French soldier by the law of his country and he would remind the Council that the French were fight-ing on their own soil got leave every four months; the British soldier, on the other hand, got leave only once a year. The British Army had come to be aware of this fact, which was causing the gravest dissatisfaction.    No doubt this
M. Orlando remarque que les Geher-aux en Chef declarent tous que les forces dont ils disposent sont a peine sufhsantes pour assurer la securite de leur front. Au point de vue de la situation militaire, il insiste sur la situation difficile du front italien; quant aux permissions, elles sont actuellement supprimees en Italie; on n&apos;envoie qu&apos;un homme en per-mission par compagnie et seulement pour acte de bravoure.   II conclut, comme M.disparity in regard to the granting of leave was in part due to the shortage of tonnage, but it was a serious considera-tion which could not be ignored. He would remind the Supreme War Council that the British Commander-in-Chief had said that if he had to extend his front he could not be responsible for the security of his line. If, therefore, the Council decided to accept the recom-mendation of the Military Representa-tives, a very grave responsibility would rest upon them. There were then three considerations which he wished to put before his colleagues : 1. That the British hold a line which covered   indispensable   ports  and valuable coal mines, neither of which was it possible for us to relinquish. 2. The question of leave. 3. The British had borne the brunt of the fighting during the past year, and as they had advanced their line in many places it was impossible to give the men the rest they badly needed, as it was necessarv to pre-pare new lines of defence.   Further, these lines had to be constructed in the abominable climate of Flanders, which was very different from the climate of Italy, for instance. If in addition to the dissatisfaction caused by the disparity in regard to leave, by the necessity of having to for-go their well-earned rest in order to con-struct new lines of defence, the British Army were told that they had to take over a new portion of the French front they would be seriously disheartened to say the least of it. He therefore would again press that a solution of the difficulty might be found by transferring Italian divisions to France.    A large contribu-tion of Italian troops to the Western front would, in his opinion, best solve the most  difficult problem which M. Clemenceau and he had to consider. Mr. Lloyd George  thought  that  the question of the extension of the line and that of the transference of Italian troops to Flanders should be considered to-gether.Signor Orlando said that Mr. Lloyd George had arrived at the same con-clusion as himself. He (Signor Orlando)^ had said yesterday that the question of the extension of the front was essentially a technical one, which only our military advisers were competent to decide for &apos; them. Sir Douglas^ Haig had said that he had so few troops now at his disposal that he could not accept the responsi-bility if he were ordered to extend his
Lloyd George, qirix y a lieu de soumettre la question au nouveau comite; il a pleine confiance dans la decision qui sera prise.Le General Petain reconnait que le secteur britannique est le secteur le plus important du front de France; il a tou-jours admis que ce secteur devait etre tenu par des troupes d&apos;&quot;une densite double de celle du secteur tenu par 1&apos;armee francaise. Cest ce qui existe. Quant aux permissions, c&apos;est plutot une question de transport qu&apos;une question d&apos;effectifs qui oblige a les reduire dans les armees anglaise et italienne.II y a des divisions franchises qui tien-nent jusqu&apos;a 12 et 15 kilometres de front; elle n&apos;occupent ce front que par des effectifs tres legers, et en cas d&apos;at-taque elle procede par contre-attaque. Cette methode pourrait peut-etre avan-tageusement s&apos;employer clans les armees alliees.front. Mr. Lloyd George had further laid stress on the conditions which obtained on the British front. As re-gards the question of leave, the French were allowed to go every four months; and the English troops could only take leave every twelve months, but he wished to point out that the Italian troops at present got no leave at all, with the ex-ception of one man per company, which was granted only as a reward for acts of. gallantry. Again, General Petain said that he could not accept the re-sponsibility of holding the French line if that line was not diminished. As regards the question of transf erring-Italian troops to France, he must point out that on this subject the Italian Coni-mander-in-Chief would naturally have something to say. v In making calcula-tions as to the number of troops required to hold a certain front, one could not approach the subject as a purely mathe-matical problem ; geographical and other considerations entered very largely into the question. He agreed with Mr. Lloyd George that the questions of the exten-sion of the line and of Italian troops being sent to France must be considered together, and that they were questions for the deliberations of their military experts.General Petain said that the points raised by Mr. Lloyd George had not escaped him when he had made his re-quest for a diminution of his front. He had always admitted that the part held by the &apos;British was the most vital along the whole front, and that the depth of troops holding that front must be double what they were elsewhere. He would remind the Council, however, that the English only held 180 kilometres of line, while the French were responsible for the security of 550 kilometres. As regards the question of leave, this was mainly one of transport. The British lacked ton-nage, and in Italy there was serious shortage of rolling-stock. The French no doubt were generous in the matter of leave, but it must be remembered that they hold their line very thinly, their front line indeed was practically an out-post line only. The actual front given to one division was from ten to fifteen kilometres. He hoped the Council would not forget that in the French army one redment consisted of only three, bat-talions, and one battalion at present only had three companies.Mr. Lloyd George said he understood that the Field-Marshal would now be prepared to accept the recommendations

On decide de soumettre cette question au nouveau comite.in Joint Note No. 10 in principle subject to an agreement between himself and General Petain as to the method of giving effect to it. The resolution, there-fore, that was about to be moved must not be regarded as an order requiring immediate execution.M. Clemenceau ruled that the Supreme War Council accepted the recommenda-tions contained in Joint Note 10 of the Military Representatives in principle, the time and method of carrying out the recommendations being left for decision to General Petain and Sir D. Haig.. (TKis resolution was formally agreed to.)Lord Milner suggested that the Supreme War Council should accept the first article of the Agenda regarding future procedure as regards the adoption of the Joint Notes, and moved the follow-ing resolution: &quot;The Head of each Government repre-sented on the Supreme War Council undertakes to notify the Military Representatives of the Supreme War Council as soon as possible whether any Joint Notes presented by them have been accepted by his Govern-ment or whether he wishes them reserved for discussion at the next meeting . of the Supreme War Council. If a Joint Note is accepted by all the Governments concerned, it shall, as from that date, be treated as a decision of the Supreme War Council.&quot;(The above resolution was agreed to.)Signor Orlando asked whether the Supreme War Council did not propose to discuss the question of Salonica.M.

Summary of Conclusions.I. Resolutions in regard to the constitu-tion and control of a General Reserve.1. The Supreme War Council decides on the creation of a General Reserve for the whole of the armies on the Western, Italian, and Balkan fronts.2. The Supreme War Council delegates to an Executive composed of the Permanent Military Representatives ol Great Britain, Italy, and the United States of America, with General Foch for France, the following powers to be exercised in consultation with the Com-tions involved, moreover, if the Italian Armies had to defend Valona it would be impossible for them to spare men for the Western front.Mr. Lloyd George was of opinion that it was all part of the question of a General Reserve, and that it was for the Executive Committee to examine the problem.Baron Sonnino pointed out that the present Session had been occupied prac-tically entirely With the discussion of questions which mainly interested the Western Allies, and he deprecated the proposal that a matter which concerned Italy so closely should not be considered by the Supreme War Council, but should be relegated to the Executive Committee.M. Clemenceau said that General Guillaumat had been instructed to examine the whole question on the spot and to submit his report upon it. Until that report had been received no profit-able discussion of the question could, in his opinion, take place. As soon as the report was submitted he thought that the Executive Committee and the Military Representatives would go into the whole . question.Mr. Lloyd George concurred in this view.No formal resolution was passed, but there was general concurrence in the view that this question should be examined by the Executive Committee.M. Clemenceau said that he proposed to summon a Meeting of the Supreme War Council to be attended by Ministers only at 2.30 p.m. that afternoon to discuss the terms of the resolution regarding the work of the Supreme War Council during the present Session.(La seance est levee a 12 h. 45.,) (The Meeting adjourned at 12.45 p.m.)
manders-in-Chief of the armies con-eerned: (a.) To determine the strength in all arms and composition of the General Reserve, and the contribution of each national army thereto.(&amp;.) To select the localities in which the General Reserve is normally to be stationed.(c) To make arrangements for the transportation and concentration of the General Reserve in the different areas.(d.) To decide and issue orders as to the time, place, and period of em-ployment of the General Reserve; the orders of the Executive Commit-tee for the movement of the General Reserve shall be transmitted in the manner and by the persons who shall be designated by the Supreme War Council for that purpose in each particular case.(e.) To determine the time, place, and strength of the counter-offensive, and then to hand over to one or more of the Commanders-in-Chief the necessary troops for the operation. The moment this movement of the General Reserve, or of any part of it, shall have begun, it will come under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief to whose assistance it is con-signed.(/.) Until   the   movement  of   the General Reserve begins, it will, for all purposes of discipline, instruc-tion, and administration.. be under the orders of the respective Com-manders-in-Chiefs, but no movement can be ordered except by the Execu-tive Committee. 3.. In case of irreconcilable differences of opinion on a point of importance con-nected with the General Reserve, any Military Representative has the right to appeal to the Supreme War Council.4. In order to facilitate its decisions the Executive Committee has the right to visit any theatre of war.5. The Supreme War Council will nominate the President of the Executive Committee from among the members of the Committee.II. Resolution in regard to the Presi-dent of the Executive Committee. The Supreme War Council designate General Foch as President of the Execu-tive Committee for the General Reserve. Ill-Resolution in regard to the exten-sion of&apos; the British front (Joint Note No. 10).The Supreme War Council adopt Note 10, subject to the time and method of the
extension of the British line being left for arrangement between General Petain and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig.IV. Resolution in regard to the employ -ment of Italian troops on the Westernfront.The Supreme War Council remit to the Executive Committee for the General Reserve the study of the question of em-ploying Italian troops on the Western front,V. Resolution as to future procedure in regard to Joint Notes.The Head of each&apos; Government repre-sented on the Supreme War Council un-dertakes to notify the Military Represen-tatives of the Supreme War Council as soon as possible whether any Joint Notes presented by them have been accepted by his Government, or whether he wishes them reserved for discussion at the next meeting of the Supreme War Council. If a Joint Note is accepted&apos; by all the Governments concerned, it shall, as from that date, be treated as a decision of the Supreme War Council.ANNEX.Note by General Bliss.1. I think that one single general principle should guide the Supreme War Council in determining the important question of the control and direction of the inter-Allied General Reserve. That general principle is unity of control and direction so far as it is possible to attain it.2. The Supreme War Council has already laid down the rule that the Allied Generals-in-Chief and their General Staffs must make their detailed plans in con-formity to the general plans adopted by the Supreme War Council in representation of the Allied Governments. These plans must be submitted to the Supreme War Council in order that it may be assured that they are properly co-ordinated, and that all tend harmoniously to the successful accomplishment of a common object. The Supreme War Council cannot depart from this rule without abdicating its essential functions.3. It is not wise to waste effort by doing a thing which it is not necessary to do. It is, therefore, not wise to create an organisation to do that which another organisation has already been created to do. It is not wise to superimpose one agency upon another agency doing the same thing. The only possible result of such action will be to produce unnecessary confusion, friction, and delay, at a time when there should exist the utmost clearness of cool and unbiassed vision, the utmost harmony, and the utmost rapidity of action.4. The Supreme War Council was created in order to secure unity of control, and unity of action. It was created, not to assume the functions of command and of execution which belong to Commanders-in-Chief and the General Staffs of the National Armies in &quot;the Field, but it was created in order that a certain general con-trol of the. common allied military efforts might be transferred from the local theatres of war at the immediate front,&apos; where that control could not be exercised in the light of a general view of the entire situation, to a point further removed from that front and from which the situation on all fronts could be seen with equal clearness, and each local situation be thus brought into its proper perspective.
5. If the Supreme War Council, through its own military agency and in harmonious co-operation with the Commanders-in-Chief and with the General Staffs is not able to undertake the solution of all questions relating to the Inter-Allied General Reserve, including its control and direction, I do not know of anv organisa tion which can undertake it. If the agency created to assist it under its immediate direction is not competent for the purpose, let the Supreme War Council change this agency to whatever extent it may find desirable; but, whatever be the final constitu-tion of this agency, it is neither necessary nor wise to superimpose another agencv on it. If the Supreme War Council cannot itself solve the problem of a General Reserve, it will have failed in the, principal function which, as I believe, it was created to perform, viz., the securing of unity of control and action; because, in the approaching campaign, the control and direction of a strong General Reserve is the only thing that will secure unity of purpose over three theatres of war which are now to be regarded as a single theatre.6. The Supreme&quot;War Council has already directed that the general attitude on the Western front shall, in general, be a defensive attitude. Therefore, the primary object in the creation of an Inter-Allied General Reserve must be the preservation of the integrity of a defensive line at the point or points most seriously threatened. It cannot be supposed that those who control and direct the reserve will use it to precipitate an offensive contrary to the accepted general plan. They can only direct it, in its entirety or in part, towards the threatened point where it immediately falls under the sole command of the Commander-in-Chief of that part of the front. If. when the enemy has been decisively repulsed, there should appear an opportunity for a decided offensive, it must be assumed that if there then be any considerable force of the reserve still unengaged, those who control it will immediately send it to the Commander-in-Chief who is in a position to make the offensive.I, therefore, propose for consideration by the Supreme War Council the following Draft of a Resolution.1. In order to secure unity&quot;of control and the maximum effort at the point or points of the Western front that may be most seriously attacked, the Supreme War Council directs the formation of an Inter-Allied General Reserve.2. Its Military advisers, after full conference with the Commanders-in-Chief, their Chiefs of Staff, and the Chiefs of Staff of the respective Govern-ments, shall advise the Supreme War Council as to the strength, composition, and point or points of initial concentration of the General Reserve. The Supreme War Council, if it approves, will then give the necessary directions to carry these recommendations into effect.3. The Military Advisers shall constitute a committee for the sole purpose of deciding to which Commander-in-Chief or to which ones of them, and the time when, the General Reserve or parts of it shall be assigned to assist in the defence; after which the control by this committee shall cease. After approval by a majority of its members, the orders of the committee for the movement of the General Reserve shall be given through that one of its members who shall be designated by the Supreme War Council for that purpose. The moment this movement of the General Reserve or any part of it shall have begun, it will come under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief to whose assistance it is assigned. Until such movement begins, the General Reserve will for all purposes of discipline, instruction, and administration be under the orders of the respective Commanders-in-Chief, but no movement can be ordered except by the committee.4. On the advice of its Military Advisers and after approval, the Supreme War Council will give instructions to the Governments and Commanders-in-Chief concerned to prepare and have available at the designated places the means of transportation necessary for the most rapid movement of the General Reserve.5 At any time during the formation or existence of the General Reserve as an independent body, the Supreme War Council may, in its discretion, give any instructions relating to it.

Frazier, First Secretary, Embassy of the United States of America.Secretariat:Conte Aldovrandi, Private Secretary to   Lieutenant-Colonel L. Storr. Baron Sonnino.Au cours de cette seance, tenue par les membres des Gouvernements seuls, sont adoptees:I0 Une declaration des Gouvernements.20 La resolution suivante au sujet de la transmission des ordres du Comite executif (en execution de 1&apos;alinea (d) du $ 2 de la resolution relative a la Reserve generale adoptee le matin):&quot; Le Conseil superieur de Guerre designe ses Representants militaires respectifs au Comite executif pour trans-mettre les ordres de ce Comite- aux armees des pays auxquels ils appartiennent.&quot;Mr. Lloyd George said that it had been suggested that the Supreme War Council should not close its present Session with-out issuing to the world a combined re-statement of the war aims of the Allied Powers.  He had read very carefully the declaration of the French Government, and the revised declaration prepared by Baron Sonnino on behalf of his Govern-ment, and was and he believed his colleagues were inclined to doubt the expediency  of   issuing  these   at  the present   moment.     Our    war    aims had been  clearly indicated  in  recent speeches by himself, President Wilson, and M. Pichon.    There were indica-tions that the moral of the Germans and  Austrians was  weakening.    We wanted to weaken it still further.  If we restated our war aims we ran the risk of losing our present advantages.   In a joint formal declaration of war aims each country must feel bound to state its . maximum terms.   On the other hand, no- -body was bound by a speech.   Numbers of  speeches  had  been made in each country, but thev did not bind Allied
Governments in the way that they would be bound by a formal joint declaration. It was impossible to formulate such a declaration without consulting the Presi-dent of the United States of America, and that would involve much dela)^ and the effect of such a delay would be bad. He suggested as an alternative that the Supreme War Council should issue a declaration stating what had been achieved during the present Session. Before submitting it for the considera-tion of his colleagues he wished to re-mind them that Hertzling and Czernin had shown in their recent speeches that the enemy Governments had no intention of relaxing their claims. With these pre-fatory remarks he asked that his brief text might be read to the Council.M. Clemenceau thought that it was not necessary to discuss the alternative of issuing a declaration such as Mr. Lloyd George suggested or a joint state-ment of war aims. It was self-evident that the former was to be preferred. He had prepared a draft statement, but m face of objections that had been raised by Mr. Lloyd George and Baron Soninno he was quite prepared to withdraw it.(Professor Mantoux then gave a ren-dering in French of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;&apos;s draft declaration.)M. Clemenceau said that he had pre-pared a declaration of his own which lie. would like to read to his colleagues. Me put it forward merely for discussion and as an alternative to that of Mr. Lloyd George.(M. Clemenceau here read his draft declaration.)He said that what he thought was required was to issue something which would give to each of the Allied Nations and armies a renewed feeling of cou-fidence, self-reliance, and assurance.Mr. Lloyd George suggested a fusion of the two declarations by himself and M. Clemenceau. He suggested that the latter part of M. Clemenceau&apos;s paper would do admirably as a peroration. His view was that the declaration might begin with his own text and conclude with the latter part of M. Clemenceau&apos;s.Baron Sonnino said that in the last speeches of Mr. Lloyd George, President Wilson, and M. Pichon his own country -men felt that they had been rather left out in the cold. He felt bound to speak frankly on this subject. He thought that some announcement should be made by the Supreme War Council of the Allied
war aims which would satisfy the aspira-tions of the Italian nation. Italy&apos;s part in the war, and what she might expect to obtain as the result of the war had, he conceived, been placed rather in the shade. In the speeches alluded to above, atten-tion had only been drawn to the rectifies-tion of the Italian front, and nothing had been said about such territorial adjust-rnents as would give Italy definite security for the future. That security it was necessary to insure, because Italy came into the war with this object only in view. Referring to the naval situation, he wished to point out that although Italy was three times as strong as Austria in those waters, she could yet hardly ven-ture to enter the Adriatic. He reminded the Council that prior to Italy&apos;s entering the war, Austria offered her certain terri-tory, but not enough to guarantee her real security. He wished to conclude by saying that no declaration could be accepted which suggested any renunciation of Italy&apos;s legitimate claims.(Here followed a discussion on the form of the text suggested by Mr. Lloyd-George, in the course of which certain minor alterations were agreed upon.)Baron Sonnino considered that if any difference existed in the substances of the speeches made recently by Allied states-men, these ought to be reconciled. He deprecated introducing into the declara-tion anything which might savour of dic-tation to the enemy nations in regard to the management of their own affairs.Mr. Lloyd George said he was not cer-tain that he was in entire agreement with Baron Sonnino. To state that one of the main objects of the Allies was to break down the domination of the military caste might wound.the amour-propre of Ludendorff and Hindenburg, but there were in the enemy nations many who dis -liked militarism as much as the democra-tic countries who were fighting the Cen-tral Powers, and he was inclined to believe that a statement to the effect that our aim was to do away with militarism would divide the enemy nations rather than consolidate them.Baron Sonnino disagreed. His view was that any attempt to dictate to enemy countries the form of government they should adopt would lay us open to the retort: &quot; It is no business of yours : if we wish to be slaves, let us be slaves.Mr. Lloyd George maintained that it was desirable to state definitely that what stood in the way of peace was the mili-tary party in Germany.S
Baron Sonnino contended that although the German Socialist might admit to himself that he wished to change his form of government, he was certainly not going to do it at enemy dictation.Mr. Lloyd George said that the point was no rhetoric, but facts. He still main-tained that it was necessary to make it quite clear to Germany and Austria that the real barrier to peace was the aggres-sive and unrepentant military caste. Peace could never be made until that class was overthrown.Baron Sonnino said that ^he was not convinced. His view was that by outside dictation you will only bind and not divide the enemy. The national amour-propre will still defy you.Lord Milner said that he agreed with Baron Sonnino, but as they were evidently in a minority it was no use con-tinuine the discussion.(After some further discussion as to the text to be adopted, it was decided that Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s text followed, by M. Clemenceau-&apos;s peroration, subject to minor verbal alterations already agreed upon, should be accepted,.)M. Clemeanceau then instructed Pro-fessor Mantoux to prepare a revised French and English text for the final acceptance of the Supreme War Council.Signor Orlando said he wished to raise the point of procedure. He thought that the proceedings should be secret, but, that the declaration, as now agreed upon, should be the only thing published.(After some further discussion, it was decided that the declaration in its final form should be published simultaneously in the press- of the Allied Countries on the folloiving Monday.)(The text as finally approved is given in the Summary of Conclusions.)With reference to paragraph 2 (d), Resolution I, of the Fifth Meeting of the Supreme W^ar Council held the same morning, the Supreme War Council passed&quot; the following Supplementary Resolution: &quot; The Supreme War Council desig-nates the respective Military Repre;-sentatives on the Committee to trans-mit its orders to the armies of their several countries.&quot;(La seance est levee, a 4 heures 10.)(The Third Session of the Supreme War Council closed at 4.10 p.m.)
Summary of Conclusions.I.-Declaration in regard to work achieved by the Supreme War Councilduring its Third Session. The Supreme War Council decides that the following declaration embodyino-the results of the meetings of its third Session at Versailles shall be published simultaneously m the press of the Allied countries on Monday, the 4th February 1918:  d&apos;&quot; The meetings of the third Session of the Supreme War Council were held at Versailles on the 30th and 31st January and the 1st and 2nd February. In addition to the members of the Supreme War Council itself, viz.,&quot; AIM Clemenceau and Pichon for France, Mr. Lloyd George and Lord Milner for Great Britain, Signor Orlando and Baron Sonnino for Italy, and the Military Representatives of the Supreme War Council, General Wevgand, General Sir EL H. Wilson, General Cadorna, and General Bliss, there were also present for the greater part of the purely military discussions the French and British Chiefs of the General Stall, General Foch and General Sir William Robertson, the Italian Minister of War, General Alfieri, and the Commanders-in-Chief on the Western front, General Petain, Field-Marshal Sir D. Haig, and General Pershing. Mr. A. H. Frazier, First Secretary of the United States Embassy in Paris, was present during the political discussion.&quot; The Supreme War Council gave the most Careful consideration to the recent utterances of the German Chancellor and of the Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, but was unable to lind in them any real approxima-tion to the moderate conditions laid down by all the Allied Governments. This conviction was only deepened by the impression made by the contrast between the professed idealistic aims with which the Central Powers entered upon the present negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, and the now openly disclosed plans of conquest and spoliation. Under the circumstances the Supreme War Council decided that the only immediate task before them lay in the prosecution with the utmost vigour, and in the closest and most effective co-operation, of the military efforts of the Allies, until such time as the pressure of that effort shall have brought about in the enemy Governments and peoples a change of temper which would justify the hope of the conclusion of peace on terms which would not involve the abandonment, in face of an aggressive and unrepentant militarism, of all the principles of freedom, justice, and the respect for the Law of Nations which the Allies are resolved to vindicate,The decision taken by the Supreme War Council in pursuance of this con-clusion embraced not only the general military policy to be carried out by the Allies in all the principal theatres of war, but more particularly the closer and more effective co-ordination, under the Council, of all the efforts of the Powers engaged in the struggle against the Central Powers. The functions of the Council itself were enlarged, and the principles of -unity of policy and action, initiated at Rapallo in November last, received still further concrete and practical development. On all these questions a complete agreement was arrived at, after the fullest discussion with regard both to the policy to be pursued and to the measures for execution.&apos;: The Allies are united in heart and will, not by any hidden designs, but by their open resolve to defend civilisation against an unscrupulous and brutal attempt at domination. This unanimity, confirmed by a unanimity no less com-plete both as regards the military policy to be pursued and as regards the measures needed for its execution, will enable them to meet the violence of the enemy&apos;s onset with firm and quiet confidence, with the utmost energy, and with the knowledge that neither their strength nor their steadfastness can be shaken.&apos;: The splendid soldiers of our free democracies have won their place in history by their immeasurable valour. Their magnificent heroism, and the no less noble endurance with which our civilian population are bearing their daily burden of trial and suffering, testify to the strength of those principles of freedom which will crown the military success of the Allies wTith the glory of a great moral triumph.&quot;H.Supplementary Resolution in regard to the constitution and control ofa General Reserve.The Supreme War Council designates the respective Military Representa-tives on the Executive Committee to transmit its orders to the armies of their several countries.o
