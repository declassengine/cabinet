D/HS/1099irw.i fib o -i tci^D^,. //ISUMMARY Of BLOCKADE INFORMATION May 3 - 9, 1918..3SQRWAY.   The new.Economic Agreement between the United States and Norway dates from May 10th. The following are its main pro-visions as signed by Dr. 3ansen(1)   The United States Government agree to facilitate the im-port into Morway from all sources of fixed annual quantities of specified commodities.

The United States Government will be consulted as to the sources of supply and will regulate the issue of licences !for exports from the United States in accordance with the respective needs of JSorway and of the Allied countries.    The Norwegian Govern-ment agrees to furnish monthly statistics of all the existing stocks in lorway of commodities imported from overseas.(2)   The United States War Trade Board will bunker and victual all ships carrying approved cargoes under .the Agreement; and subject to the right of visit and search, the Allied Governments wijLl not interfere with their sailings.(3)   Ho Goods imported under the Agreement may be reexported except to Allied destinations.   Ho articles produced wholly or
partly with the aid of commodities imported under the Agreement may be exported to an enemy country, or to a neutral country ex-cept under an Agreement which provides sufficient security that they will not be used in any way to impair the efficiency of the blockade.   Goods re-exported from Norway will be consigned to the authorised importing Associations in the countries concerned.(4) The Norwegian Government will not interfere with commodi-ties imported under the Agreement for use in factories manufactur-ing for the Allies.(5) The Norwegian Government agree to prohibit the export to the enemy of all foodstuffs except fish and fish products, all domestic animals and their products, antimony, bismuth, mica, man-ganese, nickel, tin, titanium, wolfram, chrome,ore, pyrites molyb-denum and all nitrates (except calcium nitrate).   The following commodities may be exported to the enemy within the limits speoi-fled:-Fish &amp; Fish products ...   48,000 tons per annum. Calcium Carbide    .......    10.000   &quot;Calcium nitrate 8,000   nFerro-silicon   .........     2,000   &quot;      &quot;      &quot;Iron Ore   ..............    4,000   &quot;      &quot;      &quot;Aluminium   ............. 40   &quot;      &quot;      &quot;The iron ore must not include pyrites or ore containing man-ganese.     additional quantities of iron ore and sine may be export-ed to the enemy in exchange for iron and steel and zinc goods re-eeived from the Central Empires, but the total exports may not ex-esed the 1917 figures.   Copper may be exported in exchange for cop-per goods but the total exports may not exceed 200 tons per annum. Other exports to the enemy, of which a list is attached to the Agreement, will be limited to the quantities exported in 1917 and no goods not included in this list may be exported without the con-sent of the Unitod States War Trade Board.
(6)   the norwegian government wall allow the export to the allies of certain chemical and metallurgical products, minerals, timber and fish.   the allies will oo granted the option of pur-chasing the surplus of any native produce othervthrm oommodities which may oa exported to the enemy under the Agreement,(v)   the norwegian government undertake to sanction any agree-ments for the control sad distribution of norwegian imports which the norwegian trade associations may make with&apos; the allies or- any modifications which may be necessary in agreements now existing or suspended.denmark.    we noted last weak that the banish government were disposedto abandon the idea of a general agreement with the allies and toarrange instead for a provisional exchange ox commodities *     It nowappears that the danish gofemment would actually prefer an. agreementas this would settle their difficulties with the gorman governmentin regard to their shipping.     they have, however, offered to negoti-ate,with the allies, on the basis of compensation, in deference tothe   opinion of the united states war trade board,positionthe danish shipping/is extremely difficult,     the agreement desired by denmark would have to be an agreement approved by the german government*   tho germane will sanction no agreement which reserves less than 400,000 tons of shipping for danish trade.    the&apos; allies would in this case retain only 280,000 tons of shipping for allied services in the war zone and some.80,000 tons for belgian relief.     it is accordingly to our advantage to preserve the status quo*     this appears to bo realised by the germans, who may insist-that   danish shipping shall be laid up.      in that case it is considered that our only alternative would be to requisition all the drnlsh shipping within reach - a step which the germans would probably make the excuse for serious violations of danish neutral-ity.
F\ AIt has hien ascertained that under the Agreement between Den-mark and germany and austria concluded in *$&amp;j$eh, Denmark will reoe 100,000 tons of fuel monthly during the four months April to July. The german legation at copenhagen has prepared a list of approved receivers for the guidance of the Coal distribution committee at copenhagen.gethkriabps.     mr. loudon informed the states general on may 5th that the negotiations with germany were proceeding satisfactorily.   The butch had agreed to allow the transit from germany to belgium through dutch territory of 1,600,000 tons annually of sand and gravel and to sanction the export of 250,000 tons monthly of sand of dutch origin. they would receive an undertaking from the german government that none of these materials would be used for military works,   The dutch had also agreed to allow the transit over the limburg railway of all merchandise not intended for thegerman armies, and to handle the german rhine traffic with more despatch.   mr. loudon assured the states general that the dutch government would not surrender any suc^J powers as were necessary to check offences against the dutch fron-tier regulations and that they would not allow goods to pass through holland from belgium to germany without assurances that the goods had not been requisitioned by the german authorities.   sir iv.townley is informed that the discussions as to the limburg railway are now. chiefly concerned with the difficulty of distinguishing military from civilian goods,   tho german government claim, for example, that hay and straw should be allowed to pass, as the bo commodities are required by the civilian administration in belgium.   the dutch gov-srnment have refused to accept this contention.h.m.government have refrained from putting any difficulties in the way of the dutch during these negotiations.   we have merely in-sisted that the dutch should satisfy themselves that the sand and gravel or any other commodities forwarded to belgium from holland will not be used for military purposes, and we have asked the dutch
to obtain if possiblo a reduction in the quantities of sand and gravel proposed.   We have represented that Holland oannot, consis-tently with her neutrality, permit the Germans in any way to use the Scheldt for their shipping;   but the Dutch Cabinet had already de-cided that this demand could not in any case be admitted.The fl.0.1   have submitted formal proposals for a general ratioh-ing agreement based on the discussions of tho general draft agreement recently held in London.   They omit, however, all reference to Dutch agricultural produce or to the import into Holland of fertilisers. The U.O.T. have revised and in some cases increased the rations ori-ginally proposed.The Governor General of the Dutch jfiast Indies has extended the embargo on tho export of Dutch colonial produce.   The embargo now covers tin, quinine, oapoo, timber, tobacco, sugar, tea, pepper, oof-foe, copra, petroleum, vegetable oils and skins.   Sir r&quot;. Townley will   protest against this measure.- tfhe Dutch East Indies have hith-erto been exeepted from embargoes imposed by the Allies upon the ex-port of Allied commodities, so that the action of the Dutch Jsast Indian Government seems particularly unreasonable. SftlTgERLAflD.   The wood &amp; Agricultural products Agreement, noted last week, was signed at Berne on May 1st.The Swiss Government intend to take over the purchase and dis-tribution of foodstuffs, industrial fate ana metals imported into Switzerland from abroad, and they have already mode preliminary ar-rangements for centralising the control of fats and foodstuffs. The S.S.8. are assured that&apos;the federal authorities will act in close eo4-operation with the Society.   The distribution of the commodities ire-ported oy the Government will be carried out oy the Society subject to theapproval of tho Government, and the Government will only in exceptional oases require goods to be delivered to firms included in any of the Allied Black Lists.   In all such cases the Society will oq previously consulted.   The will also cooperate as far as
/possible in effecting purchases abroad.The French have offered to supply the Swiss with 80,000 tons of coal monthly on condition that the Swiss send labour and rolling stock for loading and transport.   The French Government estimate the Swiss total monthly requirements of coal at 160,000 tons.   Of this total 75,000 tons are consumed in the factories which supply hydroelectricsi energy to the Germane.   The French Government are representing to the Federal GoYsrmment that the Germans should be re-quired to furnish this quantity of coal as compensation.   M. Schult-hee-s has received the French offer with considerable satisfaction. It should appreciably effect $be course of the negotiations now pro-coeding between the Swiss and German Governments.&quot;Hliai SUBMARINE BLOCKADE,     The following paragraph was added to the German Prise Regulations on April 9th:-&quot;A neutral vessel is further regarded as trading in tho Interest of an enemy belligerent (insofar as circumstances do not contradiot this) when the country whose flag the vessel is entitled to fly has made an Agreement with an enemy country for the cession of tonnagej or when the bulk of the neutral country*s merchant fleet is employed in enemy trade*&quot;The presumption is that neutral vessels flying neutral flags will be regarded as enemy vessels if the neutral country in question has surrendered the greater part of its tonnage to the Allies.   The paragraph may be regarded as an extreme statement of Geraan policy, under cover of which the Germans will probably introduce a system of safe conducts for ships exclusively engaged in neutral trade.The Germans have notified the Spanish shippers and Customs Agents that they mey obtain German safe conducts to cover non-oontra-bend cargo destined for Switzerland via Cette or for America and the Philippines.    Safe conducts will also be issued to vessels sailing for America to load cargoes for consumption in Spain or Switserland&apos; Safe conducts will not, however, be issued to vessels which refuse to carry cargo for firms on the Allied Black List,
The following is a summary of the losses to merchant shipping,due to enemy activity, which were reported in the period May 3-9,inclusive.
