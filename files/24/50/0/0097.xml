M&amp;ofrunent is fee Property-of His Britannic Maiestys Government.CONFIDENTIAL.[May 7, 1918.]&quot;I\   AsPolitical Intelligence Dspaetment, : I ok big x Office.Italy /002.MEMORANDUM^ H ALLASSIGN OF THE ITALIAN CHAMBER, APRIL 18-26.Italian soldiers for France.THE Chamber reopened on the 18th April. After presenting Bills for the prolongation of the life of the existing legislation for one year-as from October 1918 -and for removing the age limit of qualification for the&quot; Parliamentary franchise in the case of all men who shall have performed military service in the mobilised army, Signor Orlando announced to the Chamber the fact that Italian troops had been sent to the French front. The announcement was received with very great and general demonstrations of enthusiasm, in which even Official Socialists took part.Baron Sonnino on peace overtures.On the 20th April Baron Sonnino, in reply to interpellations and questions regarding the Czernin-Clemenceau controversy, and the attitude adopted by the Italian Government towards enemy peace overtures and the conversations which had taken place in Switzerland, while deprecating public discussion of the subject, consented to make a short statement. &quot;The Italian Government,&quot; he said, &quot;which was informed by the Allies of these various tentative overtures, .never made any formal opposition to them, although it made manifest to the Allies its absolute conviction that no practical good could result from those proposals and those conversations in the form in which they were conceived. The Government has always held that it was a question of enemy manoeuvres having .a double aim-first and foremost to create suspicions and divisions between the Allies; and in the second place to exploit for war purposes the natural relaxation which any announcement of peace negotiations might produce among our populations.&quot; At the Conference of St. Jean de Maurienne of the 19th April, 1917, haAriug examined, in concert with the Allies, the general subject of the tentative overtures which Austria was disposed to make to one or other of the Allied Powers with a view to obtaining a separate peace, we found ourselves fully in agreement, and a written memorandum was made &apos; (&apos; f u registrato in apposito verbale &apos;) &apos; concerning the inexpediency of engaging in conversations which, under the then existing circumstances, would have been particularly dangerous, involving the risk of weakening the close union existing between the Allies.&quot; For the rest, the Italian Government has never on its own account, whether as invited or inviter, or indirectly by means of intermediaries, taken any part in any similar rapprochement with the enemy.&quot; And this I declare in order at the same time to cut short at once all the rumours insidiously circulated, abroad and within the Kingdom, by the agency of the enemy or of the defeatists of all colours, of supposed conditions offered to us by Austria-Hungary, and of negotiations with that country.&quot;Bills Approved.The Bill prolonging the life of Parliament and ordering a new Electoral Register was approved on the 25th April with an added clause stipulating that before new elections were held the extraordinary powers granted to the Government should have lapsed.   The Bill granting the franchise to young soldiers was also approved.Three other subjects of oiitstanding interest were discussed during the short session, viz., the question of Food and Supplies, the Silk and Cotton Scandals, ami the Scandals in the Department of Arms and Munitions. [367-9]
Food and Supplies,Replying on the 21st April to numerous interpellations and questions, m ost having to do with local grievances and demands, Signor Crespi gave an account o f h recent work of his Department, and of his own negotiations with the Allies.Grain. When he took over the commissariat six months ago, the whole food organisation had been upset by the disaster of Oaporetto, involving as it did the loss of vast stores of army provisions. His first business, therefore, was to replenish these stocks as quickly as possible, and to this necessity other interests had to be postponed. At the same period there was a certain recrudescence of the submarine campaign and loss of grain ships, while the railway communications with France were blocked by the transport of French and British troops coming to Italy. Thus occurred the serious shortage of grain during last,winter, and the necessity for inducing the Allies to give them as much as possible and as quickly as possible. Until supplies were there to distribute, there could be no question of improvements in distribution. Hence all his frequent absences from Italy. The Allies bad been prompt in lecogaising and supplying to the best of their ability the necessities of Italy, and the situation at present compared favourably with that of last winter. At the same time, the position with regard to grain was precarious, and he felt considerable anxiety as to how they might stand in June. Every possible economy must be practised, lie had already been able to prove to the Allies that, during his administration, Italy had consumed at least 25 per cent, less grain and grain substitutes than during the corresponding months of last year. .Coal. The difficulties of the moment were mainly difficulties of distribution due to restrictions of railway transport. These difficulties would have been infinitely greater, however, were it not for the agreements of the 5th and 18th February for the transit of coal through France, which had been confirmed at the Inter-Ally Tonnage Conference in London of the IIiL-14t.li March, and were to be revised in a few days&apos; time iii Paris in consequence of the advance of the enemy armies towards the French coal-fields, and the movements of troops which had occurred on the Modaue and Ventimiglia lines for the purpose clearly indicated by the President of Council in the announcement made by him on the 18th April.Signor Orespi explained that the Inter-Ally Conferences in winch he had been engaged were not in the nature of diplomatic parleyings but practical and sometimes contentious discussions between business men. He gave a humorous sketch of his contests with the French Minister of Transport, M. Loueheur, whose word however, he said, was always - the strongest guarantee of Italy s interests. He quoted also the exclamation with which M. Clemenceau had closed a strenuous debate &quot; Tell the Italians,&quot; he had said, &quot;that the French Government pledges itself on its honour now and always to regard the Italian front and the war industries of Italy as on the same footing with the French, front and French industries.&quot; To this generous promise Signor Orlando had on Thursday given &quot;Italy&apos;s reply : Italy conic! never adequately repay the debt she owed to France for help in the past and in.the present.The crops in all Entente - countries promised to be excellent. With fair weather in May and June it ought to he possible to liberate a certain quantity of tonnage from transport of grain and food, and to employ it for that of coal and war materials.Oil, Sugar, Cheese.-The oil crop was good. Imported supplies were short but sufficient for strict needs.There was a certain shortage of sugar but it was hoped to remedy this by importation and, if absolutely necessary, two months&apos; hence, by a reduction in consumption.Fats and butter were not abundant but, being rationed, would suffice. Of cheese the supply was insufficient, even for the needs of the army. *        The distribution of these products was rendered difficult by shortage of coal and railway restrictions which must be patiently borne as inseparable from the state of war.Signor Crespi also explained the purpose and effect of the recent decrees of which note was taken in a memorandum on Italy of the 23rd April.The Silk and Cotton Scandals.Three interpellations on this subject were brought forward on the 23rd April. The first, emanating from the neutralist &quot; Unione Pail amen tare,&quot; demanded a Parliamentary Commission to enquire into &quot;all responsibilities, moral and political&quot;; the second, coming from the &quot; Fascio di Difesa,&quot; asked for a complete return of exports to Allied and neutral countries of foodstutfs and products utilisablc for war purposes
since August, 1914; and the third by the &quot; Official Socialists &quot; also demanding an Enquiry and aimed especially at the Salandra Administration. Salandra is the bete noire of the Socialists, and his proposal (adopted &quot; by the Government.) for the extension of the franchise and for lowering the age-limit for deputies lias been interpreted by them as indications of a desire on his part to return to power.Signor Daneo, who was Minister of Finance in Salandra&apos;s Cabinet, undertook the defence of that Administration. He urged that account must be taken of the conditions and outlook of the period in question, when it appeared peculiarly necessary to maintain national production in view of essential difficulties. This consideration explained the exceptions to the veto on exports, which had been granted after submission to a committee of experts. This policy of intensifying exportation in the periods immediately preceding the war, he pointed out, had. had the full approval of the existing Chamber and did not contravene any treaties. It was only in the second half of 1015, as a consequence ol the second Paris Conference that severer restrictions were put into force, which., nevertheless, still allowed Italy to profit by her exportation of her most valuable product, silk. Export was specially regulated by Government, and it was for evasion of these regulations that certain persons were now on trial.The policy of Salandra had been countenanced by his successors and was also that adopted in the Allied countries. French exports of silk to Switzerland under the system of veto with exemptions had been considerably larger than those of Italy.Signor Meda. actual Minister of Finance, defended himself against the charge of removing the veto ou cotton-silk waste. It was not in his power to do this, he said. Moreover, in the case of silk, no veto had existed previous to the Stli October, 191(5, except in regard to that quantity of waste which experts said was used in the making of gun-charges had, not existed, therefore, at the period during which the great increase in exports had been noted; in the case df cotton-waste the veto had always been in force and had never been removed. He informed the Chamber that the Government had ready for issue a complete report on exports, containing the names of all the exporting firms. He proposed that before demanding a commission of enquiry members should study this report. If, after doing so, they were still unsatisfied, a commisssioti could be asked for. By that time the judicial enquiries would have been completed, and the question of criminal responsibilities, by which Ministerial responsibilities were conditioned, would have been determined. At present a parliamentary commission would have no definite political issue before it, and would only interfere with the judicial proceedings.This suggestion was acquiesced in by most of the deputies, but as Signer Toscanelli, who was in charge of the Parliamentary Union&apos;&apos;s interpellation, insisted on pressing the demand for an enquiry, the President of the Council intervened, be had been a member of the&quot; former Ministry, and associated himself with its responsibilities. If the House insisted on a commission of enquiry he must raise the question of confidence.&apos; The Government, however, had no objection to the appointment of a Special Committee to examine the Governments returns with the same powers as the committees ordinarily appointed to examine Bills. lie moved that Signer ToscanellTs motion be heard this day three months.In the open vote which presently followed, the Government, had a majority of 158 in a House of 316. The minority was composed mainly of members of the &quot;Union&quot; and of the Official Socialists party. Some members of the &quot; Union,&quot; however, voted with the majority. Dissensions within this group had made themselves noticeable in the course of the discussion, and were greeted with ironical exclamations by members of the &apos;: Fascio.&quot; A committee of fifteen was appointed to examine the Government report. *Arms and Munitions Scandal.A great sensation was produced when Signor Bignami, Undent-Secretary of Arms and Munitions, in reply to questions, gave details of the very grave irregularities detected in the contracts branch of his Department, in connection with which three persons holding responsible posts were under arrest, viz., Comm. Francesco J3onamico, Cav. August.) JBouifazzi, and Signor Carlo Bozzetti. No charges, lie added, had been brought against any other functionary of the Department, which had been reorganised with a view to the prevention of the recurrence of such irregularities.On this question also, in consequence of the Socialist Modigliani&apos;^insistence on an immediate discussion, the question of Confidence was raised. A division gave the Government a majority of 87.   The voting was secret.
Later on in the sitting a further vote-this time open was taken on a matter of procedure, in which the Government majority rose to 165.--------......---- -Close of the Session.The Chamber rose on the 26th April after voting the Franchise Bill. Two amendments had been put down, one by Signor Salandra for lowering the minimum age for Deputies from 30 to 2a. and another in favour of granting the suffrage to women received with cheers. Signor Orlando declared himself in favour of both proposals, but urged the movers not to press them as they obviously required full discussion.&apos;The Socialists proposed that Parliament should resume work on the 20ih May. Signor Orlando refused to commit himself to a definite date, but promised that the Chamber should re-open within the first fortnight of &quot;June.The impression left by the reports of the Session is that the opposition to the Government has been materially weakened. There were fewer violent scenes than usual, and factious sabotage was almost confined to a section of the GicJittian &quot; Unione Parlamentare,&quot; which, as has been pointed out, was divided over Toscanelli&apos;s interpellation. Signor Mtti seems to have kept himself very much in the background, although his influence may, perhaps, be seen in&quot; the lessened opposition of Catholics and Gioliltians.o
