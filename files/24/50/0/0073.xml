?OHLD, S LOSSES AM) OUTPUT Q? -MBRC1IAHT. TOIfflAGS. Admiralty Nemorandum for the Menbers of the Far Cabinet.The World losses of Merchant Tonnage during the ek)nth of April from Sneny Action and Marine Risk, as at present ascertained, amount to 297,918 tons, and will be published in due course.   This, is the, lowest figure singe the, month of September jl91g.Definite figures of the V/orld1 s output of Shipping are only available quarterly, so that it will be early in August before we can say what the output of new ships has been for the second quarter of 1918.    I have, however, had an estimate of the world&apos;s output made for the month of April, and from these   figures it looks as though we had turned the corner in Shipping,   The estimate of April output, which has been compiled on a conservative basis, shows 329,745 gross tons, being 51,827 tons in excess of the losses from all causes.Iii submitting this preliminary intimation to the Members of the War Cabinet, I regard it as most Important that the fissure a should be kept secret, in case the surplus balance is not maintained during the current and next month.Further, I think that we have good reason to hope that during the month of June our losses will not rise above their present level having regard to better weather and the results of our attacks on Submarines during the last few weeks; so that we can, I hope, look forward to a credit balance of Shipping as the result of the work during the current quarter.A statement of the figures referred to in this memorandum, giving the basis of the estimate of output is attached.8.5,18.
