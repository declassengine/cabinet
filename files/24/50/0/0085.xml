*-P1^^?OLI^L^^P^t Off hob BRimmc mj?ss?jg*s ^I desire to draw the attention of my colleagues to the attached Resolutions which have been sent to me by Section XV of my Advisory Council.The War Cabinet   will, I am oure, appreciate the weight of these considerations having regard to the signatures attached thereto, and 1 shall be glad if the question of CJovernmBist responsibility for financing Housing -Schemes coule? receive tho further consideration of the Cabinet at an early date.The reference given to Section XV of the Advisory Council the Bindster of Reconstruction&apos; was&quot;Tto consider the steps and conditions apart from the provision of farm and Small Holding Colonies necessary to attract to employment on the land all returning sailors and sol-diers who may wish to take up country life, and particularly to Induce them to do so in &apos; sufficient numbers to secure the maximum out-put from the land.&quot;during the consideration of which the following resolutions werepassed and forwarded to the Minister for bonsideration:-COTPIDEKTIAL.BJf -THE MINISTER OF REC01J5TRUCTI0N.C Addisoa.2.5.18.
9 o o &amp; 0 ufee are unanimously of opinion11   SPhat the provision of a sufficient number of good houses, \fith garden land attached, is absolutely essential to the attainment of the object of our reference; that unless such; pro---trision be assured to them by the  overnmeart in advance, many agricultural sailors and soldiers will fail to return to a^ioul--tural life in the.  Baited Kingdom.; and utrbani afcd other non-agricultural workers, on their discharge from the Services, will be deterred from taking it tap, to the great detriment of the agricultural industry and our national life.2.   !2hat the responsibility of(a) finding the capital necessary,(b) defraying the difference b^&amp;ween war oost and Bormal post-war cost of building (including materials, labonGP and finance),ought to be directly, publicly and Immediately assumed by the State..3*   That the plan proposed In the local Sovernmerrt Board Cire-olarof the 18th March 1918 addressed to Housing Authorities fails to fulfil the above essential conditions, particularly because it involves postponing %l%e decision as to &quot;whether the State will or will not find the necessary capital, till after the war, whereas for the purpose of our reference it is essential that the decision should be taken and announced now.4.-   *31hAt for the   p*3cpoeo of providing stifficlent houses forex-soldiers and sailors in rural districts the County Councils and not the District Councils should be made responsible? and that the plan: advised in the Kotising Panel&apos;s Report should be adopted..5*   While viewing with anxiety the proposal that district Councilsshould be made responsible for carrying out neoessary fcuaaW ing operations, and considering that it would have been preferable to entrust this duty to the County Councils, we are of opinion  a) that, assuming the former course to have been definitely adop-t-ed, (Jounty Councils should still be given t&amp;e specific du-ty of exercising a general supervision over any scheme put forward and of taking action in the matter in tho event of any default by a District Council in the framing or carrying out of a proper scheme within a strictly limited period: (b) that in any event, the bounty Councils should be called upon to make a survey with a view to ascertaining and fixing the amount of a building actually re-quired in each district, and (c) that the area subject to a rats in respect of expenditure cn any suoh building schemes, should be the area administered by the County Council, or, failing that, should at least be in no case smaller than the area administered by a District Council.Sftiese resolutions were signed by -XES3LIE SCOT?
