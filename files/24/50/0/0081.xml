(This dooument is the property of His Britannic 2\ ajestyfs Government).War Cabinet.The Provision of Small Holdings &quot;by County Councils.Memo: &quot;by the President of the Board of Agriculture &amp; Pisheries.I am informed by the Minister of Reconstruction that he has submitted to the Cabinet a memorandum (G.T. 4479) urging the importance of acceding to the request of Local Authorities that they should now be allowed to proceed with the preparation of schemes for the prevision of email holdings for soldieis discharged from the Army and for those who will be discharged on demobilisationThe Minister of Reconstruction bases his proposals on the ground that the satisfaction of the demand for small holdings for discharged service men is a National obligation to the men concerned, whioh it ie imperative should be met without delay if the good faith of the Government is not to be imperilled, and he asks that authority should be given to the Treasury(a) to guarantee in proper oases rent charges createdfor the purchase of land and(b) to make advances to County Councils of money (up to 1,000,000) reasonably and properly expended upon the adaptation and equipment as Small Holdings of land either purchased in the manner indioated or taken upon lease.I concur with Dr. Addison in the views expressed in his memorandum and in the terms of the authority which he proposes should be given to the Treasury,   In my memorandum of October 2nd,.1917, to the War Cabinet (G.T.*2225) I set out the general opinion that I had arrived at on the land settlement question.   I wish, however, to bring the following particular considerations to the notice of the Cabinet in support of Dr. Addisonis memorandum.(l) I consider that it is undesirable to delay thepreparation of schemes for the acquisition of land until demobilisation is aotually in sight, as the purchase of land by the State is a matter which, if economy in expenditure is to be ensured, cannot be -carried into effeot in a few weeksf time.   The ecdnomioal acquisition of land is largely a question of taking advantage of favourable combinations of ciroumstanoes and making the best use of suitable opportunities as they arise.   If the State acts in haste there is danger of conditions in the market operating against the Department concerned, and prices might have to be paid which would militate against the financial soundness of the schemes of land settlement put forward by the Local Authorities. It might, however, be desirable in some cases to acquire land and defer the establishment of small holdings until after the war.cret. T. 4481.
(2) I accept the arguments which have been advanced bythe Treasury against providing finanoial aid from the Local Loans Fund for the purchase of land, and I agree with the Minister of Reconstruction that the Local Authorities should be allowed to aoquire land on the basis of an annual rentcharge, whenever this course is found to be practicable.(3) I have considered the question of the expenditureon preparation and equipment which must be incurred by the Local Authorities before the land acquired can be made available for Small Holdings, and I agree with Dro Addison that a specifio sum of  1,000,000 should be allocated for this purpose.   As any proposals put forward by Looai Authorities would be oarefully considered by the Board of Agriculture and Jlsheries, aid aa sanction Would be refused in ail oaseB where the cost of adaptation and equipment appeared to be excessive. I estimate, assuming that the purchase cf the land itself had been effected by means of a rentoharge, that the sum of  1,000,000 would, apart from housing, provide for the adaptation and equipment of 150,000 to 200,000 acres.In view of these considerations, I strongly support the proposals put forward in the memorandum under discussion, and in view of the urgency of satisfying the public demand for a definite declaration of the pdlicy&quot; of my Department as regards the provision of Small Holdings for disoharged servioe men, I would press for an early decision on the issues, raised by the Minister of Reconstruction.B.E. PROTHBRO.9th May, 1918*
