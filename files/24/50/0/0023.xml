:%fm^EPARTlMTAL DISCUSSION BEFORE CI M3MQRASDA TG THE WAR CABINET.IRCULATION OFMemorandum for War Cabinet by First Lord of the Admiralty.I have rI-UuclVou xrom Lord Pirrie a Memorandum whichis appended suggesting that the time of the War Cab  net would &apos;:. be saved and risk of friction avoided if Ministers instead of circulating independent and contentious Memoranda on subjects common to other Departments, would first of all discuss the question at issue^with the Minister presiding over the appro-priate department.    Lord Pirrie states the Case very clearly based on recent instances which have occurred in the short period since he assumed the office of Controller-General of Merchant Shipbuilding,The view he expresses has my warmest support and I hopethe War Cabinet will give effect to the suggestion, which hasbeen made by me personally on more than one occasion to thela^&quot; eMinister of Munitions^ and the/Secretary of State for War, as representing the two Departments with whom the Admiralty have necessarily competing claims and contentious issues.to be relieved of having to read and criticise a number ofconflicting and ex parte Memoranda on the same subject when/the majority of cases the question might have been settled &quot;out of &apos; court&quot;.I am sure that Members of the War Cabinet will be gladin(Sgd)   ERIC GEDDES3*5*18.
MEMORANDUM   BY   LORD   PIRR3E.theI have read/extracts from the Manutos of War Cabinet Meeting of April 24th No, 398, paragraphs 13 and 14 on the subject of Munitions and Shipyard labour, and. also Mr Winston Churchill&apos;s memorandum G*T.4306 of April 21st on Mobility of Munitions Labour, and also Mr Churchill1s further minute covering Sir Stephenson Kenfs Memorandum on the subject of Shipyard Labour G.T.4373.It occurs go me that wc should make representations to the War Cabinet and to Mr Winston Churchill that memoranda of the nature of the two documents in question should not be circulated to the War Cabinet before the points raised in them have been discussed as between the Ministers concerned.It is my opinion that very much better results would be obtained if Ihere were freer Intercourse between Ministers on the subjects concerning more than one Department than-exists at the present time and I would suggest that it be put to the War&apos;Cabinet that they should make a ruling that all matters that concern two or more Ministries or Depart-monts should first be discussed by those Departments before being presented to the War Cabinet and that&quot;where an agreement is reached between the Ministries and Departments concerned a joint memorandum could be presented to the Wat Cabinet notifying them of the agreement and asking for any sanction that may be necessary,&quot;   In cases where an agreement has not been arrived at, the point of view of each Ministry or Department could be put forward by the Departments concerned in the one document but setting forth clearly the Doint at variance.    Some such arrangement on these lines wouM9 I think, have the effect of minimising any friction which may exist between the various Ministries and Departments concerned.(signed)      PIRRIE,1,5.1918,CONTROLLER-GENERAL OF MERCHANT SHIPBUILDING.
