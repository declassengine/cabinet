Report for the week ended. 50th April. 1918.I ,UU^  fe&apos;2SJot; CoiDmittee^cf^the^ar^*&amp;Jf     Fisheries and the Minis!e^-il^oJ^Agriculture and ry o f &quot;food.^Milk^Pricese     From reports received during the week from widely, epreaa areai&apos; it&quot;is gathered that considerable anxiety and discontent exists with regard to milk prices and in particular the prices applying to the months of May and June, which prices are said to he unprofitable,Hay and Straw.     Considerable dissatisfaction is also shewn as to the present system .of dealing with hay and straw, both with regard to the method of purchase and the distribution of supplies, and it is suggested that ste.;)S may be taken to introduce a more equitable system from the point of view of the producer,     There is a growing opinion that the distribution of the hay and straw,  after the Army requirements have been met,- should be in the hands of the Board of Agriculture and not of the War Office.Pig Production Section.The correspondence still continues to be heavy, and callers are numerous.     The Director has had interviews with a number of persons as to new proposals.     She demand for the Leaflet ;i?ig Keeping in War Time&quot; and other literature is still g^eat, so much so that prints of the Leaflet are not coming in quick enough to meet the demand.Land Division,Small Holding Colonies.Holbeach.   The whole of the potatoes on this Colony have been planted, and the women are now engaged in &quot;docking&quot; the wheat and getting the land ready for mangels.     The horsemen are chiefly busy with ;i cufflliig&quot; the potatoes, horse hoeing and rolling the wheat, and the other labourers are cleaning the &quot;headlands&quot;, dykes, fences etc.    As most of the spring work has been completed it is proposed to return some of the soldiers, who have been working here on farm furlough, to their depots.Patrington.     A north-east wind has prevailed all the week and has caused&quot;discolouration to both the wheat and spring-sown corn crops.,     Some of the fallow wheats show serious signs of &quot;going away&quot; in places, the damage being due according to the Director to the &quot;Viheat Bulb Ply&quot; .    - e states that on this class of land fallow wheats are very subject to this pest, although consolidations by means of harrow and rolls have been carried out:- and sulphate of ammonia applied.     The neighbouring farmers are in a similar difficulty, one farmer being obliged to plough up some 70 acres.     On some of the grass land which has been ploughed up wire worm has been attacking the oats badly, in ppite of numerous rollings.     Farming operations on the Colony during the week included the threshing of wheat and oats, broad-casting artificial manure and sowing potatoes and linseed, rolling and harrowing wheat and preparing land for drilling mangolds.     The ewes and lambs are doling well,,     Among the produce and crops disposed of during the week weie 135 qrs. wheat, 93i qrs. oats, 20 cwt. potatoes, 5  doz. ducklings, 2-g- doz. chicks and-^ 1,475 eggs0
H ea^th^Hji 11,     The position of the farming operations on the Colony&quot;  oT&apos;whlch-the Board only obtained poosossxon at Lady Day laet, is as follows:-   Already sown:   wheat 147 &amp;c:;hs, oats 95 acres, I &quot;barley 7 5 acres, peas 8 acres, &quot;seeds&quot; for hey 116 acres, meadows for hay 87 acres, seeds for gmslng 7 acres, meadows for gracing 145 acres.    Still to &quot;be sown or planted:   &quot;barley 43 acres, potatoes approximately 60 anres, roots approximately 85 acres.Kolham Estate *After reserving sufficient seed for the present requirements upon the KeXham Estate a balance remains which is being distributed, in co-operation with the Pood Production Department, to large and small agriculturists throughout Great Britain.     The result will be to familiarise tho farmer and allotment-holder with this new crop, and thus add to the sum total of the country&apos;s experience:   to provide a feeding stuff which has been proved to be useful for pig rearing, as this question is assuming greater importance, and to enable allotment fielders, with the help of tested recipes issued by the Food Production Department, to produce syrup from beet as a sweetening agent for domestic use.     A large number of applications for the seed are being dealt with.    A remunerative contract has feeen arranged for the right of gravel dredging in the River Trent running through the Kelham Estate.     The contract is on a royalty basis, with a minimum rent, and the lessees are experts in concrete construction. In this way it is hoped to encourage a considerable local industry in a district where farming upon a more scientific scale must create a large demand fof cottages and farm buildings.     The farming operations on the Estate are talcing their normal course.Tithe^ Commons,, Copyhold and Survey Branch,During the past week the Board have received three applications for Redenption, two for Altered Apportionment and three for Merger of Tithe Rentcharge;   three for the enfranchisement of copyhold lands;   and one for an exchange under the Inclosure Acts, Six cases of Redemption, and three of Altered Apportionment have been completed, while progress has been made with various other transactions.Ordnance Survey.During the week ended 1st May, 102,850 maps were sent to France and 18,095 to the Admiralty.     26 relief models were sent to France.Publications Branch.The number of applications for ordinary issues of the Leaflets was 1,066, in response to which 4^808 copies of Leaflets were dispatched.     In addition 19,600 copies of Leaflets were dispatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution,    A further supply of 32,3C0 leaflets was sent to the Railway Companies for distribution through booking offices, as explained in previous reports.     The April issue of the journal of.,the,Board of Agriculture was received from the printers and&quot;d*i 1 tFibuVe&quot;6u        &quot; &quot;Fisheries Division.i^^^3lT^iJ^L3SSPSSSk*     ^e Home Office consulted the Branch regarding certain relaxations of netting restrictions proposed by the States of Jersey.    The Board have extended for one year their authority, enabling the Lancashire and Western Local Fisheries Committee to expend money for the stocking or re-stocking of publio fisheries for shell-fish,
Permit Section.     26 permits have been issued during the week and 21 cancelled.     A report has been received of the sinking of an enemy submarine by a Belgian steam trawler working from Swansea.Fishermen? s J*egijstrat ion and Recruiting Section,Fi she:cnen .and-Nava^S3rvice .      The Board understand that the Director of itaval &quot;Recfult&apos;i&quot;ng&quot;is circularising his officers in a sense which will give effect to the advice which the coastal officers of the Board have been instructed to give to fishermen as to their enrolment in R.1T.V.R., Section Y, or F, 125.Fishermen, Fish Trade and Military Service.     Considerable corresp^naencT&quot;has&quot;arisen as. to the operatlon^of the Decertifying Order in respect of the fish preserving trade.     On the advice of the National Service Ministry applicants were instructed to put their case to the Assistant Director of Recruiting at the port, but it haB proved necessary to write officially to Headquarters and in the end the Ministry of National SerfIce circularised all Regional Officers advising them that the fish preserving trade was not intended to be touched by the Order in question.^tpV^Loa-n-Section,     The Committee have had an interesting experience which shows &quot;&quot;clearly the results of their activities.     in April and May, 1917, as the result of visits from members of the staff, several Tenby men applied for leans but on hearing the prices of engines went no further.     One man, however, applied.again in February of the present year and accepted the engine offered him.     A second man also applied about the same time but would not take the Committee&apos;s advice and purchased an engine of a name unknown to the Committee from an agent locally.     The man was warned that he was in all probability going in for the wrong type of engine and told that he would buy his experience dearly, but he preferred to ignore the Committee&apos;s advice.     The first man is now doing exceptionally well and is the envy of the whole port, so much so that four other applica-tions have been received as a direct result of this boat;   the second man has failed to get satisfaction out of his engine and is, in fact, applying to the Committee for assistance to get another engine.Hi.cd ,Section.^cL2^-,Tlir^i??^ *     Considerable supplies have been found by the Trade Biranc!n&quot;in&quot;L6ndon and Midland districts0     These will be forwards to the Committee at Tynemouth and distributed to the Trade as was done at Yarmouth and Lov/estoft last autumn.     The difficulty still continues of getting Railway Companies to accept this material for transport, as they accept only fcod stuffs and fertilisers:   hitherto every special application by the Committee to Railway Companies has been acceded to.Sacks 0     The Se-lvage Department of the War Of face have a very large&quot;&quot;quantity of damaged Post Office bags which they are prepared to sell at a reasonable price.      These are very suitable for the purposes of the Committee, and it is hoped that this difficulty is new completely overcome.M^S)?SLJ^El&apos;^IlB.*    A scheme is under consideration for utilising the sefvTces o&quot;f men in the sea-side camps for catching fish by seine nets and other similar means in their spare time, the Committee to
advance money for the purchase of the necessary gear.    It is also-under consideration that wounded men in the convalescent stage might be available as crews to professional fishing boats.     The matter will probably be taken up by the War Office.Freshwater Fish Section.        &quot;This week has seen the continuation of elver sales which now run to well over 900,000, and orders still continue to be received in good numbers.     The amounts demanded are not usually large, showing a widespread public interest.    The issue Of the Defence of the Realm Regulation dealing with eel fisheries is awaited prior to commencing systematic work on the development of the fisheries.The normal work of the Board proceeds on lines indicatedin previous reports.3rd May, 1918.Secretary,
