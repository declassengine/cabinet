/o86SUMMARY OF BLOCKADE INFORMATION26th April - 2nd May 1918.It is reported that the Germans are reorganising theSouth Western Railway in the Ukraine and are converting a certain portion of the line to German gauge.   The Germans appear to have assumed complete control of the food supplies at Kiev, but they are careful to work through the Ukrainian Government.   They are requisitioning sugar, grain and flour.   Their proceedings have already aroused considerable hostility among the peasants, who have in some cases forcibly resisted the German agents.   The peasants of the Dnieper have threatened to destroy their stocks rather than surrender them at the requisitioning prices.   The Uk-rainian peasants generally continue to conceal their stocks and are wilfully neglecting the Spring sowings.   These are at least 40$ below the average.2.   DENMARK.     The Danish Government are now disposed to agree with the United States far Trade Board that it will be better to aban-don for the moment any idea of a general Agreement and to arrange instead for an exchange of commodities with the Allies according to the principle of compensation.   This change of attitude is owing to the report of the Danish Commission which recently visited Berlin to discuss the Allied Shipping proposals with the German Government.   The Germans insist upon the Danes retaining at least 400,000 tons of shipping for their own use.   If Denmark can keep 400,000 tons of Danish shipping out of the hands of the Allies, the Germans will not molest Danish vessels trading in Danish interests outside the war sone, but they have as yet offered no guarantees in respect of Danish vessels in the Anglo-Danish coal trade *     A Danish Mission is leaving for Washington to discuss the position with the War Trade Board.   They will announce that the Danish shipowners will be compelled to lay up their ships al-together unless they are allowed to reserve 400,000 tons of Danish shipping for Danish trade.
Some of the Danish fishermen are reported to be installing small steam engines in their boats in place of petrol engines with a view to resuming trade with Germany.   Others are obtaining petro-leum from Germany.in return for an undertaking to send the Germans 3C$ of their catch.J3IBBBH.   The Swedish Government are shortly putting forward counter-proposals for an Agreement with the Allies.   If these proposals which we understand to be final, are not accepted the present Government may give place to a Conservative Government which will be in sym-ppthy with the German designs in Finland.   The Swedish Government will offer to hand over to the Allies 400,000 tons deadweight of shipping inclusive of the 100,000 tons already ceded under the modus Vivendi and to limit their exports of iron ore to Germany to 3,500,000 tons.NORWAY.   Mr. lansen lately informed the United States War Trade Board that, before signing the draft Agreement with the United States, the lorwegian Government desired an explicit recognition of their right to take over the control and distribution of commodities imported into Norway from overseas.   This meant a partial supersession of the Hor-wegian Associations and of the existing machinery of guarantees, and the institution of a new scheme of control which Sir M.Findlay con-siders to be unsatisfactory in more than one important particular. The United States War Trade Board informed Mr. Hansen that they could make no further concessions, and that, if the Agreement was not signed before he left Washington, the negotiations must be regarded as at an end.   The Allies would not in that event regard themselves as bound by any of the concessions promised to Morway in the lapsed Agreement.   Mr. iiansen thereupon gave way and the Agreement was signed ad referendum at Washington on April 30th.   Negotiations regards ing the control by the Associations of imported commodities will be conducted at Christiania.   Meanwhile the United States Licensing Authorities will require association certificates before granting any applications for export licences.
flEIpitLABDS.   On April 25 the Dutch had made counter proposals to the German Government.   They offered to allow the transit over the Limburg Railway of all goods of a non-military character and of foodstuffs for the civilian population of Belgium and proposed that the transit traffic in sand and gravel through Dutch territory should he limited to 1,600,000 tons per annum and that these materials should not he used for military works.   It is understood that the Germans will also require 250,000 tons of sand and gravel monthly of Dutch origin.   The Dutch Government realise that they must be satisfied with a formal declaration of the German Authorities that supplies sent through Holland in accordance with the above proposals will actually be used for civilian purposes.Shortly before the Dutch made these counter proposals the Germans added a new condition to their original demands, namely, that German and Austrian ships should be allowed a free passage down the Scheldt.   The Dutch Government unanimously decided not td accede to this proposal.we understand that the position has eased since the Dutch counter proposals were made and that the Germans are not now in-elined to press their original demands.SWITZERLAND. Early in the week the Swiss Government agreed to furnish the Allies during the six months following May 1st with 180,000 tons of wood and to fulfil in addition outstanding contracts for 50,000 tons. They also undertook to reserve for the Allies 80/? of their exportable surplus of milk products, and to limit their exports of cattle to Germany to 20,000 head or their equivalent in preserved meat.   Since the Swiss Government agreed to these concessions, how-eve r, German influence in the Federal Council or German threats ap-pear to have modified their attitude.   The wood Agreement was to have been signed on April 27th, but the Swiss Government on that date asked leave to defer their signature.   They also announced that they wished to reserve at least half their milk products for ex-port to Germany.The Swiss negotiations with Germany, though they have already
4.89r, lasted for six weeks, have as yet led to no definite results. liela-tions between the Swiss and German delegates are strained and the ef-fort to reach an Agreement may eventually be abandoned.   -The Swiss strongly resent the insolence of the German attitude.   They have re-jected outright the German demand that the Swiss should send no fur-ther supplies of wood to the Allies, and they appear to be resisting the demand that no German coal or raw material shall be used in the Swiss factories which manufacture munitions for the Allies. The Allied Ministers at Berne have officially intimated that, if the Germans press this demand, the Allies will retaliate by cutting off supplies of copper, oil and other raw materials from the Swiss factories which work for Germany, and by disallowing any further imports to Germany under the B.S*S. Agreement and any distribution of food-stuffs or other commodities imported through Allied territory to German persons or firms in Switzerland working for the Central Empires or included in the Swiss register of Commerce for 1914.The German Government have agreed to grant safe conducts to Allied vessels carrying supplies to Switzerland under an Allied flag; pro-Yide d the vessels fly the Swiss flag beside the Allied flag. The Ger-mans also stipulate that the word &quot;Switzerland&quot; shall be painted on the vessel and that the eargo shall be covered by certificates issued by the Swiss Legation in the country of origin.*SRMAN SUBMARINE BLOCKADE.
