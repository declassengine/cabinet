i Thia Document is       &quot;vopeny (.&quot; Hhi Britannic Covenirnsflt.)let May, 1918.of Shipping.MEMO.. TO THS WAR CABINET.With reference to the agreement signed by Lord &quot;ifiner amd General Pershing on the 24th April&apos;/ regarding the conveyance of American troops in British tonnage,the Shipping Controller submits that he may be informed whether the Cabinet orders to provide tonnage for the conveyance of the greatest possible numbers of American troops, at great sacrifice to British cargo etc., still stand.The whole negotiations regarding the conveyance of American troops in British tonnage are recapitulated shortly.The first definite agreement on this subject was reached on the 30th January last, and provided that the British should convey:-(a)...   12,000 troops a month for American area.(b)...   150,000 troops, the personnel of sixDivisions, the combatant troops (about 90,000) of which were to be brigaded with the British Army, &amp;nd the non-combatant troops, about 60,000,were to be despatched to the American area.On April 1st the War Cabinet gave instructions that, putting aside the above agreement, every possible effort was to be made to provide tonnage for the conveyance of infantry and machine gun sections from America to this country, as these troops would be brigaded with the British and French armies in France.     A special mission, including the Director of Transports and Shipping, was sent toAmerica/
America to expedite the despatch of these troops.From the attached extracts from telegrams exchanged with Lord Heading (a and b attached), it will be seen that the American Government agreed that the full capacity of British tonnage available was to be used to transport infantry and machine gun units.On 21st April a telegram was received from Lord Reading embodying the text of a memorandum submitted by Mr. Secretary Baker to the President, which memo, was accepted by the Cabinet.     In this memo, it was stated that the United States would continue to supply throughout the months of April, May, June and July, for transportation both in its own and controlled tonnage and in British tonnage, infantry and machine gun personnel.     Subject, of course, to the usual reservations, this statement was quite definite and the hope was expressed that the number of such troops would be not less than 120,000 a month.     Emphasis was placed on the fact that only small numbers of other troops would be sent as necessary, and that they would be sent in American ships.In consequence of these negotiations every possible effort has been made to place on the North Atlantic every ship suitable for the conveyance of troops.     This policy^ entails great sacrifices by the British Nation, but these sacrifices were accepted, as it was understood that the gain to the British and French armies by the addition of this infantry and machine gun personnel was go great as to make the sacrifices worth while.The agreement signed between Lord Milner and General Pershing on the 24th April, however, contains no definite promise that Infantry and machine gun personnel will be sent in the ships, either British or American,except those of the original 6 Divisions.     On the other hand, itmakes/
makes it quite definite that after the infantry, etc., of these Divisions have been carried, the other personnel of these 6 Divisions is to be brought.     This seems quits contrary to the arrangements mentioned in Lord Reading1s telegram of the 12th April and in the memo, submitted by Mr, Secretary Baker to the President and accepted by the V-ar Cabinet on the 24th April,It is tc be remembered that the addition of these men to the British and French armies does net involve very serious questions of supply, but that the conveyance of large additional numbers to be added to the American Army raises at once the most difficult questions of supply and maintainance, for which existing ship tonnage is inadequate, while transportation and port facilities in France are already congested.From the agreement signed by Lord Milner and General Pershing, it is gathered that the decision whether or not infantry and machine gun units are to be brought over after the completion of the six Divisions is to be left for decision, on a survey of the military situation at such time and is then subject to certain provisoes.The Shipping Controller would therefore be glad to be informed whether the vievv now taken of the military situation is such as to admit of any relaxation, so far as is now practicable, of the special measures taken to divert tonnage, regardless of consequences, in order to bring over infantry and machine gun unit3.Thus the Shipping Controller has at present to consider the di\er.sion to carry 2CV000 American troops, of tonnage capable of carrying 40,000 tons of frozen meat. As this meat cannot, so far as is known, be supplied inAmerica/
America, such a diversion will result in a shortage of meat for military or civilian purposes, equal to the total consumption for one month of the Allied Armies in Prance.The estimated accommodation provided in British ships is as follows:-May June July130,000 150,000 150,000In American ships the American Authorities expect to convey:-May June July95,000 80,000 95,000
EXTRACT FROM TELEGRAM 10th APRIL TO LORD READING.&quot;Is it clear to American Authorities that the old arrangements, in which 12,000 details per month for General Pershing were carried via the United Kingdom in British ships, is cancelled, and that henceforth the full capacity of British tonnage is only to be used to transport, via England, infantry and machine gun units intended to be brigaded with British troops in France&quot;.EXTRACT FROM REPLY FROM LORD READING, DATED 12th APRIL.&quot;It is clear to them (American Authorities) that hence-forth full capacity of British tonnage available is to be used to transport infantry and machine gun units via England&quot;.EXTRACT FROM MEMO. SUBMITTED BY MR.SECRETARY BAKER TO THE PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AIvORICA.&quot;The United States will continue throughout the months of April, May, June and July to supply for transportation both in its own and controlled tonnage and in that made available by Great Britain, infantry and machine gun personnel.     It is hoped, and on the basis of study so far it is believed, that total number of troops transported will be 120,000 per month.Also that preferential transportation of infantry and machine gun units is not to be regarded as ao exclusive as to prevent the Government of the United States from including vrithtroops carried in its own tonnage, relatively small numbers of personnel of other armies.
