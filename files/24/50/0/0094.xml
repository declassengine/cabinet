Joint Memorandum by- the President of the Board of Agriculture-, and Fisheries and, the Minister of Reconstruction.With reference to the acquisition of land for settlement and other purposes already in contemplation, we desire to put before the Vfer Cabinet th,. following proposals dealing with the matter^In view of the- fact that it is an important feature in the National Policy at the present time to take all possible steps to increase very largely the output of home grown food, it is clear that, whatever other means it may be necessary to adopt, a higher standard of cultivation of land will be indispensable.     It is now generally recognised that it will be no longer possible to regard the use of land as a purely economic question to be regulated only by the prospect of individual profit, or by the interest of the landowner in the matter;    and that it will be necessary to set up a different ideal, namely the maximum production of food*     As pointed out in Part I. of the Report of the Agricultural Policy Sub-Committee such maximum production must henceforth be the sole aim in the management-of estates, which will involve increased capital being devoted to the land, the provision of good cottages for labour, the setting up cf an industrial ladder by creating small holdings for owners and occupiers, and the development of agricultural organisation and eduoatirn generally.Increased powers for the acquisition rf land upon payment otherwise than in oash by the State are imperatively needud in connection with the provision of improved facilities for training, the settlement of an-increasing number of men (particularly of ex-service men)upon the land , and the development of many areas for increased food produotion, and the provision of rural housing accommodation incidental to these purposes;   and in particular to meet the urgent requirements of the County. Councils for land with which to prepare for the prospective demand for small holdings under the Small Holdings Acts.upon demobilisation.The action of County Councils in this matter has been temporarily interrupted by the war;   but the Councils are anxious to resume this work as reon as possible, and it seems clear that they will need assistance for securing sufficient land fcr the purpose.     At the end cf 1914 the unsatisfied demand for land under this head arose from 6,432 individuals and 2 Associations, and the land required amounted to 89,251 acres, and though for the moment these demands may be rv yarded as in abeyance beoause of the call for men in every direction, yet they will be renewed in increased volume on demobilisation and the release of men from special war employments.The question of land settlement is one of extreme urgency whicb involves the need of a large increase in the power of land acquisition which cannot safely be delayed.     As indicated by Mr* Pre thero in his Hinute of October 2nd 1917 to the Var Cabinet (G.T.2225), land settlement is one of the most pressing questions of policy for the country;   it is also, one that requires an
immediate decision so that the neoeseary preparations for action may &quot;be made before the demobilisation of soldiers begins to take efTeoW -It is therefore essential that an immediate deoision should be reached on the policy to be adopted, and that steps should be taken at once to give the Government the power of securing, in accordance with the demand., the large area of land that may possibly ba oalled for.4* It has also to be remembered that a considerable amount of landmay need to be acquired by the State in connection with the policy of afforestation.5. The Board have already put forward the following proposals:-(a) to acquire suoh Glebe land as they desire c ompulsorily.(b) to acquire college and foundation and other lands by voluntary agreement.(c) to give a tithe payer statutory power to redeem tithe rentoharge by payment of the redemption price i,n land.6. We feel, however, that these proposals do not go far enough tomeet the requirements of the State.     The scheme of the B&apos;-ard, except in the oase of Glebe lands, is restrioted to aoquiring such lards as an rwner desires to sell and does not seem adequately to meet the needs of the situation, as the State would be limited to the land whifah the venders were prepared to dispose ofe    We are convinoed that the State should possess full power to aoquire suitable land for the purpose of settlement, afforestation and reclamation, or demonstration of improved methods of food production, with the least possible delay and wherever required.7. It will be remembered that Parliamentary sanotion to theprinciple Of oompulsory acquisition of any land required for agricultural purposes has already been given by the provisions of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act 1908 and the powgfb now sought involve no departure from the principle incorporated in that Act though providing for a different method of payment.8. The proposals whioh we desire to submit for the considerationof the War Cabinet may be summarised as follows:-(a) To acquire oompulsorily any land needed for land settlement, demonstration and experiment,- afforestation and reclamation, and the development of rural industries.(b) To aoquire by voluntary agreement adjoining land needed in connection with, though not directly for, the specified purposes.(c) To empower the Brard to hold, sell, exchange, lease, develop and administer land so acquired, and also to delegate to public authorities the power of development and administration..
(d) To provide that the basis of purchase ^should &quot;be a fixed annual rentcharge guaranteed &quot;by the State with full power of re-entry in case of non-payment.(e) To provide that such rentcharge should he based on the net annual value of the property and not on the income derived from it, and that such annual value should, failing mutual agreement, be determined by arbitration.The procedure in regard to acquisition and. valuation is now being considered by the Aoouisition of Land Committee.9. In the event of a Bill being introduced to incorporate theabove proposals, there should, we oorsider, be also a Schedule of purposes, and we suggest that the compulsory powers for acquisition of land should be for the purpose of -(a) oarrying cut schemes of land settlement and the development of Rural Industries.,(b) promoting and extending Forestry,(c) reclaiming Waste Land,(d) providing for Housing Accommodation connected with any cf the foregoing sw&amp;a-ee-W. oiqet^ .10. If the abeve proposals should be adopted, the State would thusimmediately be given a free hand for expeditiously acquiring suoh land as may be needed, no matter in whose hands it may be, always provided that the purposes of the Schedule are complied with.C. A. ADDIS OH. R. E. PROTHERO.May 10th, 1918.3.consider that compulsory acquisition in exohango for a fixed rentcharge should be the subject cf a particular deoision by tho Cabinet.     I am not prepared to advooate the right of the State to enforce upon the owner the acceptance of such an exchange in lieu of cash, for which he may be able to effect a more advantageous investment.     I, therefore , can only recommend the principle of compulsory acquisition en the condition that tghe owner of land so taken receives the option of the fixed rentoharge or its equivalent in cash.R. E. P.XIn my view the adoption of the word &quot;may&quot; will involve an extensive demand for purchase outright, thereby involving the State in heavy oapital charges which the scheme seeks to avoid. I therefore retain the &quot;&quot;ord 11 should&quot;.C.A.
