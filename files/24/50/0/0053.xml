fHj^JSSMiSg Io 0$ HIS BRIT^HllIQ MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).WAR     QABIO T.POSITION OF CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIONjgeroorandurn by Conciliation and ArbitrationBoard,1.     On the 4th March, tho Board wrote to tho V:ar Cabinet regarding a claim for a IZ^fo bonus from Clerks in the Royal Dockyards,     They pointed out that &quot;their decision on this claim involves a principle of the first importance and may load to results of a far-reaching character&quot;, and asked the Cabinet for any information whioh they could properly accord to the Board as to the grounds for the grant of thebonus &quot;in order that they may be in a position to decide how far the same considerations are applicable to the conditions of service of the claimants in the case before them&quot;.S*     On the 7th March the Cabinet replied by sending a copy of War Cabinet Minute 317 of the 7th January, 1918, directing the Board*s attention in particular to Minute 1* By this liinute the Cabinet dc cidod that all applications for an inoreaso in war advances should bo referred for decision to the Ministry of Labour who might refer them to the Committee on Production,     The Department concerned might at the discretion of the Ministry of Labour negotiate, but &quot;the final decision will in all cases rest with the Ministry of Labour&quot;^     Thoy also decided that, in regard to tho lZj$ bonus, &quot;the adjudicating authority shall work within limits&quot;, of a &quot;ryeneral formula for maximum concessions for the settlement of the 12-g$ question&quot;.,.3*     On the 11th March the Board replied in a letter to the Prime Minister, mentioning that further claims wore before them, and enquiring whether the decision of the 7th January had altered tho reference to the Board by excluding oither the XZ^fo advance, or all war advances^ from their purview*4*     On the 20th March a Meeting of tho War Cabinet took place at which tho Chairman of the Board was prosont* Mr. Barnes put in a memorandum^to the effect that inasmuch *3966 as, \vbon tho ,;as initiated, men .on an upstandingwage were excluded from its operation, claims made by Government employees in receipt of an upstanding vvage or salary Kshould not be accepted by tho Conciliation and arbitration Board&quot;*    The Chairman pointed out that &quot;tho award might affect tho whole of tho Civil Service&quot;, and mentioned that by an over-riding minimum rule Writers in Royal Dockyards had already received the bonus.?,T.- 4453..
5,     The result of this meeting was that the Cabinet were agreed that there had been no intention cf referring Government employees engaged on clerical work to the Committee on production,  that there had been no intention of extending the 12^.- bonus to clerical workers,  and thai it was undesirable in view of the quasi-judicial functidf of the Board to restrict their Terms of Reference to meet a particular case,  and they decided that Minute I of ,ar Cabinet 317 of the 7th January, 1918 was not to De / gee War        read as in any way limiting the sphere of the Conciliation Cabinet 368, and Arbitration Board as set forth in their Terms of iinute 15,     Reference. p6,     The Eoard then communicated with Mr, Barnes, v-h, very kindly attended the Board on the 20th April and gave them full information regarding the origin and history of the grant.     He said that it was no longer possible to exclude-Government employees from considerati on the ground of their receiving an upstanding wage since the Mini atry of Munitions had extended the 12j , bonus, with the concurrence of the Ministry of Labour, to the clerical staff in controlled establishments-7,     The present position appears to the Board to-be that His Majesty*8 Government (through the Board of Admiralty and Minister of Munitions) have in fact approve! the extension of the 12\-% bonus to (a) numerous employees on an upstanding wage, (b) clerks in controlled establishments and (o) (in one instance), cler ics in the Civil Service.     The policy indicated in the Cabinet c&amp;inute of the 20th $arch would therefore appear to have been abandoned.     &apos;Anis inference is confirmed, by the information that for. Barnes v/as good enough to give to th Board.   From this it seems clear that the original intention of the grant has been wholly obscured by its subsequent extensions,  and cannot afford a basis for. the determination of -the claims now before the Board,8.     The Board think it necessary in vie&quot;/ of the wording of V/ar Cabinet Canutes of the 7th January and 20t) i:arch, to put these observations on record before proceed] further with the claims before them in order to avoid any possible misconception as to their position.(Sd,) W.J.
