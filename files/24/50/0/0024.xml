6) 0(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BHUTAN HI C MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)j$ BJT&apos;  . k.T. 4424.WAR CABINET -NORWEGIAN PYRITES(1Memorandum by the Ministry of Munitions1.Pyrites is the raw material recuired for the manufacture of Sulphuric Acid on which the manufacture of High Explosives and   ro-pellants depends;   a continuous adequate supply is thus a primaryssential for the conduct of the war. Sulphuric Acid is also essen-tial for the manufacture of Sulphate of Ammonia and Super-phosphates, two fertilisers on which the Pood Production programme is very large-ly dependent.tHitherto nine-tenths of the Pyrites imported have been obtained from Spain; with the exception of one very small mine in Wales; the only alternative source is Norway.3,      The Foreign Office, Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions vie?/ with grave anxiety the almost complete dependence of this coun-try on Spain for a commodity so essential.     The Ministry of Shipping prefer the import of Pyrites from Norway to the much shortervoyage.4.As the result of long and hard-fought negotiations c in Norway by experts Bent out for the purpose by the Mini Munitions, terms have been reached with the Norwegians foohase of up negotiatorsto 25-0,000 and of Sirtons of Pyrlbs, which in the opini M. Findlay (His Britannic Majesty1at Ghristiania) are the best that can be secured.     Sir M, has advised that the price asked for the Pyrites (Sulphur is not materially in excess of the cost of production in 850,000 tons is over 30 per cent of the estimated consump the next IS months.onducted stry of r the pur-on of the s Minister Fin&amp;lay Content; Norway, tion during5.      The following shows the comparison between the prices paid for Pyrites from Spain and the offer now made from Norway after taking into account the various conditions appertaining to both supplies, e.g. the supply of coal on the one hand and copper on the other, freight, Insurance etc., i.e a comparison of prices delivered in thii country.Cupreous Non-CupreousPyrites Pyrites.Cost per unit.

The Admiralty have pointed out to the Treasury that the voyage from Spain to the necessary Ports in the United Kingdom is an exceptionally dangerous one and the proportion of vessels engaged in the Ore Trade which has been lost has probably been
higher than the proportion of losses amongst vessels engaged in any other form of Trade. In view of the fact that the losses on these vessels have to be paid by H.M.? Government, the higher price of Norwegian Pyrites would, in Their Lordships&apos; opinion, probably be balanced by the decrease in the sums that would have to be paid to satisfy the insurance claims.

7. The proposal to purchase Norwegian Pyrites on these terms was submitted to the Treasury on the 24th and 26th April 1918, the Treasury declining to sanction the proposal on the ground of price. If the Norwegian Pyrites is not purchased it will probably be necessary to purchase large quantities from the Rio Tinto Company, and the terms they ask are much more onerous in the matter of coal supplies than those asked by other Pyrites mines whose figures are given.

8. It is understood that the Norwegian-American agreement has just been signed with a clause prohibiting Pyrites exports to enemy countries. It is possible but unlikely the price asked by the Norwegians may be reduced if the present offer is refused, but H.M. Minister in Christiania has reported that the Germans have already made a firm offer to pay a higher price to store until delivery can be made than we are now asked for immediate delivery

9. The important aspects of the question are not aspects of cost, but on the one hand if we do not secure the Pyrites we are left dependent on Spain, and strikes or a revolution there would seriously affect the carrying on of the war and in the last resort might have fatal consequences. On the other hand the Germans are most anxious to get the supply for their own needs and apart from that will go to great lengths to prevent Great Britain obtaining it so that we may be left dependent on ? in.

10. The Foreign Office, Admiralty and Ministry of Munitions have made the strongest representations to the Treasury that the purchase should he sanctioned, but up to the present the Treasury have declined sanction. His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister at Christiania has telegraphed that "delay appears most dangerous in view of German offers". It is understood that the offer to us is to be withdrawn at the end of the week ending 4th May, 1918.

May 3rd, 1918.
