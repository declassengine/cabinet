/ , / This Document is the Property ot0*^a?       %mi!*&apos; b aWAR   C A B I S B TfSHIPYARD LABOUR *^7Metao^andum &quot;by the Seoretary^cf State for \7ar.I circulate the following remarks by the Adjutant General on G.T, 44061-1.     The initial decision arrived at by the War Cabinet in July 1917, was considerably restricted by the second decision taken en 19th March. 1918 (War Cabinet 367 (13) in which the War Cabinet limited releases to skills   workers cn &quot;hull construe-tion and repairs&quot;, and excepted men whe are below the clean cut age or employed on their trades in the Army.   This has the effect ( a contention which is supported by Sir A.Geddes&apos; semi-official letter of 23rd April. 1916 (-Appendix A) and by conferences with the Admiralty) of cutting out all the engineering trades.2.     The Admiralty Repro-eentat-iYe at Kew has been given aocess to all suitable cards in the Index, regardldes of category or corps, and has selected men primarily from the 4 pivotal occupations31. Platers &amp; Riveters.32. Shipwrights &amp; other workers in wood.33, Labourers Shipyard &amp; boilershops,44. Erectors, Turners, fitters.Of the other occupations of which shipyard trades are composed, lie has taken only sufficient to meet the demands whioh are communicated to him periodically by the Admiralty; of these subsidiary occupations he has at present 4,000 scheduled names in hand.3*    As regards the pivotal ocoupations, the Army at home has been to all intents and purposes cleaned of suitable men with the exception of:-(a) Suoh as are still being   received at Kew as the result of the &quot;advertisement&quot; published in Command Orders in March last, which are continu-ally declining in number, and(b) Men who arc employed at certain trades in the Army (Appendix I), and who cannot be taken with-out detriment to our fighting efficiency.The number of men who have been withheld from release on this account amounts to 4,000, of whom some 3,000 may be regarded as belonging to the 4 pivotal occupations already referred to and 1,000 to other trades not immediately required oy the Admiralty..The very small number of excepted trades (Appendix B) indioates tho light in whioh the War Cabinet decision has been interpreted.4.     In connection with the withdrawal of men by the Admiralty Beprc sent at ire, I should like to mention that themen
men actually selected are very carefully considered on the information he has available from the card3 regarding their skill, and very large numbers of cards we have given him have been reject-^ ed by him at Kew.   Over 1,000 of those sent forward from Kew have been rejected by the Admiralty on various, but chiefly on trade, grounds at the Discharge Centre at Ripon.5,     As regards fue original allotment of 20,000 skilled and semi-skilled men to be withdrawn from the   Army, I have no knowledge as to the information on which this estimate is based. It is, I consider, desirable to draw attention to the fact that of the 80,000 originally allotted, 12,500 were to be skilled, which would make the proportion of skilled men in the Army quota of 20,000 to be 3,125.   v/e have already released woll over this number in the pivotal occupations.6.     I attach a statement, Appendix C which shows the disposal of the whole of the 16,800 men at home with regard to whom action has been taken.   Iim tMs it will be seen that:-(a) 6,000 men released amount to..................6,000(b) 5,000 orders still circulating through unitsand Record Offices total......................5,000(o)    Errors in cards and drafting account forapproximately.............................. .-.3,000(d) Other casualties amount to...................1,100(e) Men who refused to be released amount to .....   400(f) jien rejected by Admiralty representative at the Discharge Centre chiefly for tradereasons total............................... 1,30016,6007.     Steps were taken on the 14th April to institute with-drawals from all Forces overseas other than France, and at the present moment action is being taken in compliance with our orders.   Basing the number of men available in these theatres on those obtained from the Forces at home, I estimate that a probable further number of skilled man will be gradually obtained amounting to 2,000.8.     To sum up *(a).   I consider that everything possible has been done in the spirit of the War Cabinet order of the 19th March to rel&amp;asa men at home, and such as the Admiralty Representative has required have been given to him with tho least possible delay.(b) The onus of the non-selection of men placed at their disposal lies with the Admiralty Representative upt$ approximately 3,000 semi-skilled plus many thousands whose cards he has returned to tho Index as unsuitable.(c) 4,000 mon of certain excepted Army trades still remain in the Army and could be released, to the seriousdetriment
detriment of the Army, and only if the &quot;.7ar Cabinet alter their present decision.(4)   The investigation of the Card Index at Kew and of the applications made by individual soldiers through their Commanding Officers points to the fact that the iiececsary numbers of men of the skill required &quot;by the Aomiialty do not exist in the Army at home.(e)   A lengthy experionce of -che met bode employed by Goverrcnent Departments to facilitate the number cf men required for the Army, indicates clearly that the Admiralty methods produce little or no result in regard to substitution and up-^radin^.8th Hay, 1918.HILH3R
APH2HDIX A.23rd April,1918.My Dear a.G,I understand that the expression &quot;e-onstrue-tion and repair of ships1  hulls and structure appertaining thereto&quot; was not intended to cover marine engineering,     lb is the wording of Section A of the Schedule of Protected Occupations, marine engineering &quot;being included in Section F, which is the geneial engineering section.     As, however,  the Admiralty did not agree the list in the first instance,  it is open to them to suggest any additions to it, and J do not think that you could reasonably insist on the leturn to the iiimy oi men employed in marine engineering whatever their age,      I think, however,  that 2reu should insist on the return of any men employed in marine engineering who are fit for gererej  service, and oome within the age group 19 to 23 inclusive, as the men of these ages are caught by the clean cut which the Cabinet decided on Friday last,.     The other three additions which they suggest are, I think, reasonable.Yours sincerely,(Sd.) A. G.GEDDES,Lieut-General 8ir C.P.H.l acxeady,K.CB., K.C.M.G.War Office,Whitehall, S.W.1.
