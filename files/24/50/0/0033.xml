SECRET.j       ministry  of  food.Repbr/t for Week ending Wednesday, May 1, 1918.SHALL GPART I.-ACTION TAKEN.The Consumers&apos; Council, on 1st May, expressed their deep sympathy with Lord Rhondda in his illness and their earnest hope that he would soon be restored to health and be enabled to resume his official duties. They further expressed their satisfaction at the fact that Mr. Clynes was directing the policy of the Ministry in Lord Ehondda&apos;s absence.The following agricultural bodies have accepted Lord Rhondda&apos;s invitation to send representatives to serve on the Agricultural Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Food :-Central Chamber of Agriculture :-Earl of Selborne. Mr. Colthup. Mr. W. J. Cumber. Mr. S. Kidner. Mr. C. Middleton.Royal Agricultural Society : Earl of North brook. Mr. Alfred MahselL Mr. Henry Overman.National Farmers1 Union : Mr. Colin Campbell. Mr. S. Ward. Mr. E. W. Langford. Mr. P. W. Cox. Mr. E. M. Nunneley.Welsh Farmers&apos; Union : Major D. Davies, M.P. Mr. Ellis Davies, M.P.Welsh Agricultural Council: Mr. C. Bryner Jones.Scottish Chamber of Agriculture: Mr. Hugh W. B. Crawford.Highland and Agricultural Society :  Mr. Charles Douglas.Scottish Farmers&apos; Union : Mr. William Donald..Royal Dublin Society : Mr. Bertram H. Barton ; or Mr. E. M. Archdale, M.P.The three Departments of Agriculture have been invited to send liaison repre-sentatives.On Thursday, 25th April, Mr. Clynes, accompanied by the Secretaries -and Scientific Advisers, met the representatives of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress in further consideration of the question of supplementary rations. Mr. Gosling expressed the view that organised labour as a whole was opposed to any inequality of division whatever. They would prefer to have a flat rate, with a temporary extension of the purchasing power of coupons, if and whenever additional supplies became available, as in the case of bacon at the present time.   Ita   (33)5683-1   Pk 1   125   5/18   E &amp; S - . A
was pointed out that, in fulfilment of- Lord Rhondda&apos;s promise that preferential treat-ment would be given&quot;- to heavy workers, supplementary ration cards had already been issued, and that a considerable number of workers were already drawing additional rations. On the suggestion of Mr. Clynes, it was decided to appoint a small committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Labour, and the Parliamentary Committee,&quot; with;-scientific &apos; and medical advisers, to consider the somewhat altered situation.Meantime, the Central Classification Committee have suspended the issue of further instructions in the case of women as well as the investigations which they were making on their own initiative into certain staple industries. They propose, however, to complete their enquiry into the Woollen Trade with which they have made considerable progress and to consider a report which the Divisional Commissioner for Lancashire has promised for women in the Cotton Trade.&apos;    ... * Supplies and Prices.Allied Requirements. Sir Guy Granet has been notified that the purchases of frozen beef for May at the prices quoted in the United States would involve a serious financial loss on re-sale here at, the maximum prices now in force in Great Britain. On the prices quoted for May the loss would approximate 900,0001. on the operations for the month.   Sir Guy Granet has taken this question up with Mr. Hoover and cables as follows :  ,     ......   . .&quot; We are fully alive to the position and regret the recent advance in prices which, however, was inevitable. For many months prices of beef animals have been considerably below actual cost to the raisers, and this has resulted in very strong representations being made to the President WoodroAv Wilson, U.S. Government and U.S. Food Administration by the leading live-stock associa-tions throughout this country. It was proved to the satisfaction of the U.S. Government that the position as put forward by the cattle raisers was correct and that unless higher level pf prices could be established supplies of animals ... for future requirements would be seriously jeopardized. A gradual advance in price was contemplated, but this policy was embarrassed by very large orders unexpectedly placed on the market for the U.S. Army and Navy which unfor-tunately coincided with our inquiry&apos;for our May requirement, the market in consequence getting entirety out &apos; of hand. We arranged a co-operation scheme as reported in our 69746. We have gone fully into the matter with J. P. Cotton, head of Meat Department, U.S. Food Administration. There is no intention of U.S. Food Administration controlling price of live-stock other than by the price paid to packers nor under existing U.S.A. laws have they such powers. The demands of the U.S. Army and Navy and American domestic trade are evet increasing, and although the question of beefless days here is under consideration, no decision has as yet been reached. Eliminating this course of. action from our calculation, and reviewing the whole situation, bearing in mind we are now in the usual season of short supply we cannot anticipate lower prices for the next two months, and it is quite possible that further small advances may be established, although we trust they may:hot be necessary.&apos;&apos;The proposed heavy diversion of refrigerated tonnage to the Atlantic will in effect cut off large supplies of Australian and Argentine meat which are essential for feeding the Allied Armies. Sir Guy Granet has been asked to report as soon as possible what beef of good quality can be secured to meet these requirements from June onwards. &apos;  -With a view to saving freight-space steps are being taken to see if a portion of the meat can be shipped as boneless beef.Lord Reading has cabled that the Canadian Government have agreed to provide approximately 40 million dollars for cheese during 1918. The price of cheese has been definitely fixed at 23 cents for the first grade, 2M cents for the second grade, -and 22 cents for the third grade, for all cheese made after March 1st. &apos;-&apos;-r - Lord Reading cables that he has authorised Sir Guy Granet, so far as finance is concerned, to proceed with the purchases of bacon, hamsrand lard up to 200,000 tons in addition to the normal programme for other products. -. -:Sir Guy Granet reports that the commitments- of the Allied Provisions Export Commission for week ended 27th April amounted to 60,875 tons, with a value of 36,777,893 dollars.    ... &quot; .&quot;      - .
, Bacon, Hams, and Lard-The quantity of cold storage available for storing bacon has proved to be less than was anticipated, and this may necessitate the release for immediate consumption of a larger quantity than was originally contemplated in connection with the Rationing Scheme. The situation is receiving close and constant attention, and steps are being taken to prevent bacon being wasted. All bacon leaving the packing-houses On and after the 1st May will be salt cured and salt packed, and this, which will begin to arrive in this country about the middle of June, can be kept in ordinary storage.Meantime it is proposed to raise, temporarily, the coupon value of these, articles, and on and after Sunday,&quot; May 5th, the amount purchaseable on one coupon will be as follows :  .Cooked. Uncooked.Bacon with bone - - -7 ozs. 8 ozs.Bacon without bone   :- - - -    5 ozs.&apos; 7 ozs.Ham with bone   -        -        -  10 ozs. 12 ozs.Ham without bone       1 -        -    8 ozs. 10 ozs.Picnic hams up to 5 lbs. may be sold for two coupons, with one coupon for each additional pound or part of a pound.Fore-hocks, gammon-hocks, and ham-hocks, (with bone), up to a maximum weight of 3 lbs., and sheet ribs up to a maximum of 2\ lbs., may be sold without coupons.This new scale will remain in force for not less than four weeks.Butter.-A further purchase of eleven tons of batter has been made in. the United States of America at40-f cents per lb. f.a.s. in New York, 875 tons of butter have been purchased, in Denmark, iiOO tons of this being Great Britain&apos;s share of the exportable surplus at 528s. per cwt. f.o.b. approximately, the remaining 275 tons being part of the Danish reserve, purchased at 317s. per cwt. f.o.b. approximately.During the week ending 27th April, 2,947 tons of butter arrived from Australia, 1,213 tons from the Argentine, 571 tons from the United States of America, 29 tons from India, and 13 tons from Brazil, making a total of 4,773 tons for the week. The stocks of butter in hand on April 27th were 11,440 tons,4 and the quantity on passage 17,000 tons.   On April 29th a distribution of 4,190 tons was made to the Trade.Cereals.-An Order, dated 24th April, 1918, revokes the Wheat (Seed) Order, 1918, under which it was forbidden to use certain varieties of wheat, except for the purpose of seed. The effect will be, that after May 1st the surplus stocks of these varieties of wheat will be available for millers..Cheese. Advice has been received of a further shipment of 82 tons of old season cheese from Canada, and of 2,382 tons of cheese from New Zealand, where 26,621 tons are in. store awaiting shipment; 9,153 tons of cheese are now on passage from New Zealand; 179 tons of cheese have arrived from the United States of America, and 1,530 tons are on passage; further contracts have been placed, amounting to 9&apos;, 721 tons. .    -Cold Storage-The Cold Storage. (Restriction) Order, 1918, dated 27th April, 1918, requires that it be an implied term of every agreement for the placing of any article in cold storage that such article shall be taken out within seven days of notice to that effect being given by the Food Controller, and the Food Controller may, by notice, prohibit the delivery of any articles into cold storage, or require them to be taken out of cold storage.   .: -Fish-The Freslnoater Fish Order, 1918, dated 19th April 1918, enacts that any person may, until 15th June 1918, buy, sell, or have in his possession ior sale any freshwater fish certified by the Fishmongers&apos; Company to be freshwater fish imported from abroad or from Scotland or Ireland.Jam Brices. Owing to the increased duty on sugar, it has been necessary to advance the maximum price of jam by Id. per pound, and the public has been notified accordingly.Meat.--The public are settling down to general acceptance of the rationing scheme, .and the two principal difficulties to be contended with at the present time are : :(1) The sale of meat in excess of the prescribed quantity, and (2) Complaints as to the character of the meat imported from North America. &apos;:      To deal with the former, an extended system of inspection will probably be necessary, but steps are already being taken to check the number of coupons taken by the butcher with the quantity of meat he is permitted to buy.
Many of the complaints referred to in the latter are unfortunately well-founded and strong representations have been made to the Buying Commission in New York to establish more stringent inspection ; this is now being done.Supplies at the present moment and in the immediate future are fully adequate to maintain the ration.&quot;Milk. The operation of the Cream Order. 1917, which was due to expire on April 30th, 1918, has been extended until further notice.The Sub-Committee on the Government control of the wholesale Distribution of Milk has for its terms of reference : (1) The immediate steps necessary for the control of the collection, utilisationand distribution of milk sold by wholesale. (2) The need for establishing new depdts and the geographical allocation of such depots.The evidence before the Committee has called special attention to the following (amongst other) difficulties : (1) The wasteful competition in the collection and handling of milk by superfluousdepots or factories situated in the same area. (2) The diversion from areas that geographically should feed large towns. (3) The difficulty in properly adjusting the amounts of milk that are required(a) for the manufacture of milk products, (b) for human consumption. (4) The need for a proper organisation to balance supplies and to convert surplusmilk, whether by the action of farmers&apos; co-operative societies or by whole-salers such as the United Dairies or by the wholesale organisation attachedto a federation of retailers. (5) The fact that large organisations, if uncontrolled, will result in a single sellerand thereby place consumers in the hands of that seller to the possibledetriment of quality, price, hours of delivery, &amp;c. (6) The need of educating the farmers in the production of cleaner milk, thereby(a) making a more wholesome supply, (6) preventing waste. (7) The damage to and loss of milk caused hy :  (a) Delays in railways ;(6) Insufficient treatment prior to transit, such as lack of coolingfacilities; (c) General lack of organisation.The Committee hopes to publish a report immediately.The application of the United Dairies, Limited, for the issue of fresh capital was referred by the Treasury for the observations of the Ministry of Food. In view of the fact that the application contained no provision for any sort of control being exercised by or on behalf of the Government, the Ministry were unable to support it. The whole project will be reconsidered in the light of the recommendations of the sub-committee on Government control so soon as the report has been published.Oil Seeds. The Ministry of Shipping has granted freight space for 128,000 tons of oil seeds and fats, and it is hoped that Treasury sanction may be obtained for the purchase of the necessary supplies.Negotiations are now in progress for the purchase in the Argentine of oleo oil and premier jus (f .o.b.). It is suggested that the steamers remaining in the whale oil trades should be requisitioned, so that any profit on freight would accrue to the Government; the Ministry of Food would purchase f.o.b., the steamers being chartered by the whalers.Potatoes. Returns from persons farming 1 acre of land and upwards of potatoes indicate that the acreage under potatoes in Great Britain in 1918 will exceed the 1917 acreage by about 25 per cent., and that, allowing for allotments, cottage produce, &amp;c, the total acreage already planted, or set aside for planting, with potatoes in 1918 should be about 900,000.This result appears to be very satisfactory, and, unless the season proves remarkably unfavourable for potatoes, should provide a complete safeguard against shortage.The census was taken by the aid of police, and the returns (about 270,000 in number) were tabulated in two days by a number of County Council schools, whose staff and scholars were at the disposal of the Ministry of Food for this purpose.Tea. The position of blind tea hawkers was discussed at a conference attended by representatives of the Local. Government Board, the Advisory Committee on the
Welfare of the Blind, and the chief tea agencies concerned. This Ministry&apos;s proposals for alleviating the position of these hawkers are at present under consideration by the interests affected. No final decision will be &quot;reached without further consultation of the Loca] Government Board.It has been decided to abandon the system of distribution based on supplies during the year ending the 30th June, 1916, and to substitute a new system based on the registration of customers with retailers. As a corollary of registration it has been decided to make the maximum prices hitherto in force fixed prices. It will thus be made impossible for a consumer to obtain cheaper tea by transferring his custom from the shop from which he has usually obtained supplies.Organised Distribution.Meat Rationing Scheme. In view of representations as to the difficulty of dis-posing of edible offal, on account of the fact that the coupon values are thought to be too low, it is proposed to raise the equivalent weights of all edible offal other than tongues, skirt, kidneys, and loose fat.Queues in front of butchers&apos; shops have practically disappeared throughout the country.. National Rationing Scheme. The Department is now engaged in preparing all necessary machinery for the inauguration of the National Rationing Scheme on 14th July.   The National Ration Book and the form of application are now being printed.Au important point in the South Midlands has been raised with reference to the relative position of butchers and grocers, as grocers, owing to their registration as butchers for the sale of bacon, had been attempting to deprive the butchers of their customers for fresh meat. The position of the butchers has been adversely affected by Meat Orders, and by meat rationing. The Divisional Commissioner thought it advisable that the small amount of trade which was left them should not be interfered with by the grocers.The report from the Ministry of Labour discusses the advisability of extending rationing to such other articles as bread, cheese, and tea. The co-operative societies and some sections of labour appear to be in favour of such an extension, but it is thought that the working class generally, especially the poorer section, are opposed to it, unless and until it becomes an absolute necessity. The proposal that the tea ration should only be 1J oz. per week appears to have been received with something like consternation by working women in many quarters. It is noted that some discontent has followed the introduction of the scheme for granting extra rations to heavy workers.- At Messrs. Cubitt&apos;s works, for example, in the London and South-Eastern district, a good deal of grumbling is said to be going on owing to the fact that the extra ration is now being granted all round.Enforcement of Orders.The total number of prosecutions for the past week was 1,621 an increase on the previous week of 962 cases.There were 778 prosecutions in England, Scotland, and Wales, 737 of which were successful, and 843 cases in Ireland, 811 of which resulted in convictions. The Division which reported the largest number of prosecutions was London, with 393 cases, 367 of which were successful, and the North Western Division was second on the list with 166 cases, 164 of which were successful.Prosecutions which numbered over a hundred were those in connection with :  Potatoes      -        -        - -        -  526Bread -        -        -        -        -        -   209Tea......-  118The legal department of the Ministry have undertaken five appeals in the High Court, in respect of alleged contraventions of the Food Controllers Orders. They were successful in every case.In Committee on the Defence. of the Realm (Food Profits) Bill, an amendment was accepted to provide that the measure should not be retrospective. An amendment moved by Mr. Lough to leave the infliction of the double penalty to the discretion of the coiu-t was defeated by 90 votes to 25. The Bill was reported and afterwards read a third time.
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.The recent improvement in the imports of food was well maintained in the week ending April 27th, the total quantity of the principal foods and feeding stuffs received reaching the very high figure of 320,400 tons (Table A). The increase Over the previous week (109,300 tons) was mainly in cereals, but nearly all&quot;the principal items were higher. The arrivals of wheat and flour amounted to 132,000 tons against 88,500 tons in the week before. Converted into equivalent grain the increase was 46,000 tons. Not since the week ending August 4th, 1917, have arrivals of wheat been so large. For -the first time for a long jjeriod the imports have exceeded consumption and resulted in an addition to stock. In other cereals the improvement was even more marked, maize, barley and rice totalling 98,600 tons as compared with 40,200 tons the week before. Maize arrivals more than doubled on the week, and were the largest recorded for. any&quot; week since December 9th, 1915. ,. Receipts of meat were much better than in recent weeks and amounted in all to 17,200 tons. Bacon and hams were also up on the week, and are somewhat in excess of the week&apos;s consumption on the new rationing basis.More than 5,000 tons of butter arrived. For the third week in succession imports of cheese were practically negligible ; the weekly average for the corresponding period of last year was more than 2,200 tons.Consignments of tea received represented approximately three weeks consumption.The one important commodity showing a decline was sugar, where the imports were 15,400 tons less than in the previous week. On the other hand, the arrivals of glucose were unusually heavy.-&apos;.        . Consumption.Meat.-The supplies of meat at the four markets included in Table B. (home and foreign meat taken together) for the week ending April 20th were 7 per cent, above the previous week and . 28 -per cent, below the. corresponding week last year. Both home and imported meat recorded increases on the week before, the former of 300 tons or 17 per cent., the latter of 80 tons or 2 percent. Imported supplies were. 63 per cent, of the total as compared with 66 per cent, a week ago, and with A 2 per cent, a year ago. For the week ending April 27th, total supplies of meat at the London Central Markets were 3,701 tons, showing a decline of 9 per cent, on the week before and of 25 per cent, on the year before. Home supplies showed an increase of 111 tons, but a fall of 490 tons in imported meat brought the latter down to almost the same level as in the corresponding week of last year.Market returns of live stock show that the number of cattle stalled in the week ending April 20th was practically the same as in the preceding week. The number of sheep declined by 4 per cent.        .The following tables gives a comparison with 1917 : Number of Gattle Stalled.Week ending	-Number of Markets.	-   1918.;	1917.

inFish. The quantity- of fish passing through Billingsgate Market during the week ending April 27th was 2,284 tons, as compared with 2,153 tons in the week before and with 1,968 tons in the: corresponding week of last. year.

Movements were small, and in the main in the same direction as in the first fortnight of the month. An exception is sugar, which, after rising from 218,000 tons on April 1st to 286,000 tons on April 13th, fell slightly to 283,000 tons on April 20th.
