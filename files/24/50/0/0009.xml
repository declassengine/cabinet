This document is the Property of His Britannic Ma,jesty*sGovernment).War Cabinet, Possibilities of Food Production in 1919. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries.On pages 0 and 3 of my Memorandum (G.T.4308), I stated that we had already prepared a scheme for the further extension during the next twelve months of the arable acreage of England and Wales, and that this extension is essential if the cereal output anticipated for 1918 ia to be maintained in 1919,The scheme is now submitted as originally prepared.     We are already short of our minimum requirements by 30,000 labourers, and this shortage, together with the further reduction in the existing staff of labour, now decided upon under the Military Service (No,2) Act, 1918; will necessitate the abandonment of the proposal.T)*e scheme is now submitted in order to complete the record of the agricultural considerations which I desire to place before the Cabinet.in reference to the demand on agriculture for military man-power.     If home-grown food is still considered to be vital, a fresh supply of labour must be found:    otherwise ;it is doubtful whether even the old arable area can be properly cultivated, still less the additional land brought under the plough this year, and we cannot think of attempting to add further to the ,land under crop.In any case, if the scheme were adopted by the Cabinet, it would necessitate further legislation0     tinder the Corn Production Act, with its limited powers of directing cultivation, the scheme now submitted could not be carried into effect.     But landowners accepted that Act on the understanding that the compulsory powers now exercised by the Board under Defence of the Realm Regulations should cease on August 20th, 1918, and that the Corn Production Act should then come into operation.     Unless we are assured of adequate labour, assured, that is, that the existing shortage of labour will &quot;be made good, and that the existing staff will be maintained, we cannot, in my opinion, ask for legislation to continue the compulsory powers which we exercise under the Defence of the Realm Act for the extension of arable cultivation on the plea that the further exercise of those powers is necessary for carrying out the programme of increased food production.Secret. G.T.4409,May 2nd, 1918.R. E, PROTKERO.
This would surely be a good return on the man-power^invested.POOP PRODUCTION POSSIBILITIES IN 191$. (England and Wales)MEMORANDUM by the DIRECTOR-GENERAL of FOOD PRODUCTION.In the memorandum (G.T.4308. Appendix B) which I submitted to fhe Cabinet on April 21st, reference was made to the new Agricultural Pro-^arame for 1919 which had already been prepared by the Food Production Department.   It was also indicated that, in face of the new situation created by the transfer of agricultural labour to the Army, not only would this Programme Of increased food production have to be abandoned but that It would be impossible even to maintain the scale of production reached during the present year.Nevertheless, I feel that it is the duty of the Department to acquaint the Cabinet with the proposals that had been elaborated and which ifould still be possible of achievement if the necessary labour could be ^ade available.    The accompanying &quot;Programme for 1919&quot; is therefore sub-aitted, in order that the Cabinet may have the opportunity of weighing its 7&amp;lue and importance in relation to other war problems, and so be in a position to take the responsibility of either accepting or rejecting it. in immediate decision is necessary if anything is to be done.Incidentally J may point out that to reject the Programme will not solve the labour problem - unless the Government is further reconciled to face a serious falling off from the seale of production which has been attained this year.   To maintain that scale through the coming year would necessitate (a) the replacement, by adequate substitutes, of the men now being called to the Colours, and (b) the finding of the additional labour promised by the Cabinet on the 13th of December but not yet supplied.On the other hand, to accept and carry through the new Programme irould require (in addition to the&apos; above) only a small re-inf or cement of labour, viz. 24,000 in all, of whioh only 3.400 would be required this autumn and the remainder not until spring.    This great economy of labour nould be made possible by developing, to the utmost extent, mechanical Rids to cultivation.The other essential requirements are set out in detail in the [attached memorandum, but they may be briefly summarised as followsHorses.- 14,000 additional, most of which it is understood could beborrowed from the War Office.Tractors.- Completion and delivery of the orders already placed.Other Agricultural Machinery and Implements.- Tt the value of about  B---1-  1,400,000.Fuel and Oil. - To the value of  .900,000.Certain legislation would also be necessary, as explained in I the memorandum.On the other side of the account, it will be observed that the programme, If carried through, would achieve the following results(a) Maintain the soale of production reaohed this year (Without a new programme this will be impossible).(b) Provide an additional 5 weeks1 supply of breadstuffs for the entire population.(c) Save shipping, to the extent of 87S,000 tons net.This, added to the estimated results of the 1918 Programme, [8nould make the United Kingdom practically self-supporting in the matterI3f breadstuffs and show a net total gain in shipping (as the result of Jhanges introduced into our methods of farming and milling since December 1916), of nearly 5,000.000 tons.
(b) The grading up of arable farming.The Executive Committees have already done much to improve poor farming in many counties.     It is anticipated that in 1919 much more can be done in this direction than was possible in 1918.     Gommittees are now well organised and have gained experience, and they have at their disposal resources which were not available when tillage for the 1918 harvest began.Increase of the Area under Arable Cultivation.The following types of land should be aimed at :-(i) Clay soils, well adapted for oorn growing, which must be broken up in summer; about 200,000 acres in all,AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMME FOR 1919,ENGLAND AND WALES.In 1918 a special effort was made to increase the area under-oorn in England and Wales, and it is anticipated that as a result the proportion of arable land under grain crops will rise from theaverage of the ten year period 1905-14, to about 62$ in 1918.     Corn growing exhausts the land, and in view of the difficulty of securing labour for thorough tillage and manures for restoring fertility, it would be most undesirable to attempt to maintain the 1918 acreage of corn on the existing arable land.     This policy would almost certainly involve diminished production in 1919 and a rapid decline in the fertility of the soil in subsequent years.On the other hand, it would be equally undesirable to adopt any policy which reduced the total area under corn in 1919.     The Department have, therefore, come to the conclusion that more grass land should be broken up, so that while the present level of corn produo-tion is, at least, maintained, there may be opportunities for resting and cleaning part of the exhausted arable land of the country.The Department have further come to the conclusion that a strong effort must be made to increase the area under potatoes, as this crop produces more food per acre than any other grown on the farm.These considerations lead them to recommend the following policy for 1919:-(a) The ploughing of an additional area of 1,000,000 acres ofpermanent grass.     Were this addition made the distribution of arable and grass land in England and Wales would be as shown below.     Corresponding figures for 1875 are added for comparison.-1919 1875acres % acres %Arable land        14,000,000        52    14,800,000     55Grass land 13,080,000        48    12,000,000     45    -27,080,000      100     26,800,000   100
(ii) Grass of medium quality on dairy farms to be broken up for the purpose of providing winter food for cows.     The quantity is very uncertain, and the area available for corn would possibly not exceed 50,000 acres;    in addition, however, a considerable area, not less than 50,000 acres would be broken up to provide forage and root crops;(iii) Pastures now used for grazing store cattle and for fattening both cattle and sheep.     The grass should not be of the highest quality, but should be distinctly good.     The soils should vary from loams to heavy loams and be well drained.     An attempt should be made to secure 700,000 acres of this class of land.Labour and Supplies Necessary.For the purpose of giving effect to the policy of breaking up 1,000,000 acres of permanent grass land, it would be necessary, by September next, to complete the delivery of the Ford Tractors and Oliver Ploughs already sanctioned;   to have at ccmmand 7,500 of the 13,000 to 15,000 skilled ploughmen promised;   and the same number of plough teams, say 20,000 horses.     Of the horses required, about 7,000 have been provided.     It is believed that of the balance, the greater number oould be borrowed from the War Office.In addition to the foregoing, which have already received Cabinet approval, it is estimated that the new ploughing programme would require.-Labour.- 24,000 permanent workers, chiefly men, viz:- 3,400 in autumn, 13,600 In spring and 7,000 in the summer months. In addition, seasonal labour would be required for potato planting and lifting - mainly women and boys; and for corn harvesting, mainly soldiers.Implements and Machinery.- It is estimated that an expenditure of &quot; 1,400,000 on machines and implements will be necessary. These would be chiefly manufactured in the U.S.A., and the importation would call for 30,000 tons of shipping.   Host of the purchases would be for use with Government tractors, steam engines, or teams.     After the war, there will be a great demand for farm Implements and the expenditure would be partially recouped by re-sale.     While the machinery was in the possession of the Department, it would, of course, be hired out for cultivating, harvesting and threshing.Paraffin, Petrol, Lubricants.- It Is estimated that in carrying out the tillage required up to the time (April, 1919) when the corn crops would be sown and potatoes planted, the expenditure for paraffin, etc. would be about  900,000, and that 35,000 tons of shipping would be called for.Fertilisers.- The requirements for the new arable land would be small, as the intention is to plough up good soil.     The approximate needs would be 25,000 tons superphosphate (involving 22,500 tons of Imported phosphate rock and pyrites), 25,000 tons basic slag, 25,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia, and 15,000 tons of flue dust. .Seed.- No difficulty is anticipated in providing the amountrequired.     The quantities necessary would represent in wheat less than a day&apos;s supply of bread;    in oats less than a week&apos;s consumption of provender;   and in potatoes about ten days&apos; supply for Great Britain.     In the event of the 1918 crop being adequate, the potatoes required would be taken from those that otherwise would be fed to pigs, and would be equivalent to 5,000 tons of pork.
The number of parsons who might be provided with food as the result of carrying out the programme would depend upon the uses to which the crops were put.     The larger part of the oat crop would probably be used as horse corn, but if the situation were such that the greatest possible quantity had to be reserved for human food, then the effect of the programme on the food supply would be as follows :-Food Provided by Land under Tillage^No. of persons fed forone vearFrom 200,000 acres wheat, 28 bushelsper acre, milled 85$      ...            ... 455,000From 550,000 acres oats, 34 bushelsper acre, milled 50$      ...             ... 620,000From 150,000 acres potatoes, 6 tonsper acre, used for food direct        ... 620,000From ditto, 1 ton per acre used inpig-feeding       ...           ...         ... 30,000Total number of persons for whom)subsistence diet provided for   ).................    1,725,000one year )Food provided by Land under .Permanent Grass.10,000 tons meat and meat offals produced per annum on 200,000 acres claysoil broken up for wheat in summer of 1018 25,00055,000 tons meat and meat offals . produced on 700,000 acres goodpasture land broken up in the winterof 1918-19        ...                  ...            ... 150,000Additional number of persons provided for    ... 1,550,000Addition to Breadstuffs.Xf the products of the tillage land including potatoes be estimated in terms of breadstuffs, it may toe shown that the land to be broken up in 1919 would produce about 550,000 tons of flour &amp;nd meal equivalent to aboyt 6 weeks&apos; eurplv, for the United Kingdom.Effect on Meat Supply.The conversion of grass land into arable would destroy grazings capable of producing about 65,000 tons of beef and mutton per annum.     The products of arable land, according to the uses to which they were put, would produce from 6,000 to 42,000 tons of pig-meat.     Beef and mutton would also be produced on arable land;   if no allowance is made for this as the production would not begin in 1918-19, the maximum loss of butcher meat would be about 60,000 tons per annum.     It is believed that this loss - which represents about 5$ of the quantity of beef, mutton and meat offals produced In the United Kingdom in recent years - would not endanger the civilian^ present ration of butcher meat, unless the demands of the Army on home produce were largely increased.
AQ S uEffect on Milk-Supply.-It is probable that the ploughing of 100,000 acres of grass on dairy farms would add to the amount of milk produced, but for the present no increase is assumed;   the advantage claimed for the change of system is that the supply of winter milk would be increased at the expense of summer milk, which is relatively abundant.5.   Shipping Space and the 1919&apos; Ploughing Programme.The effect of the programme on shipping may be estimated by calculating the space saved by the crops grown, and the space required by imports due to the programme.     The crops grown on the 1,000,000 acres included in the 1919 programme may, for this purpose, be taken to be :-Shipping tons.Wheat 200,000 acres (28 bushels plus seed) 700,000 qrs.s 196,000 Oats   600,000    &quot;     (36 bushels plus seed) -2,700,000 qrs.s 694,000 Potatoes 150,000 &quot;   equivalent to say 240,000 acreswheat * 235,000Other Green Crops for cow-feeding 50,000 acres. (These are assumed not to affect shipping, but, with oat straw, to balance the products of 100,000 acres ploughed up).Shipping Tons (40 cubic feet) required for)crops grown )The claims on shipping space would be :-55,000 tons beef and mutton displaced by grain on 700,000 acres of grazing land, less 6,000 tons pig-meat.      (Stowage space of beef and mutton 100 cub. ft. and of pig-meat as bacon at 64 cub.-ft. per ton).10,000 tons beef displaced by grain on 200,000 acresof heavy wheat land     ..* . 5,000 tons pig-meat lost through provision of seedpotatoesImplements and machines      ... ...Paraffin, Petrol and Lubricants ...Fertilisers ...Demands on shipping caused by programmeNet Gain in shipping if programme is completed1,125,000128,00025,0008,000 30,000 35,000 23,000249,000876,000 tons6* Effect on Foreign Purchases.It may be noted that while the cereals grown on the new tillage land are a necessity which must be imported if not grown at home, the meat displaced is not absolutely necessary, and no foreign purchases of meat need be made if, for financial reasons, the purchase is undesirable,7, Powers of the Department:   Legislation Needed.It is clear that the programme contemplated for 1919 cannot be carried out unless the Board are armed with compulsory
powers to enforce it.     The pres-enVposition is that in accordance with Section (11) Sub-section (3) of the Com Production Act, the powers of the Board under the Defence of the Realm Regulations will expire on the 21st August next, and after that date the only cowers which the Board will possess will be those contained In Part IV of the Corn Production Act.     The powers of that Act are quite insufficient to enable the Board to carry out the programme proposed for 1919.     The Act might be used to deal with cases of bad farming though even In those cases the procedure is very slow and is subject to appeal and reference to arbitration, but it would be quite Impossible under those powers to compel farmers who were not farming their land badly to change completely their methods and to force them to change from being graziers and to become arable  farmers^The only remedy under the Corn Production Act, if a farmer -declines to carry out an order of the Board, is to determine his tenancy, and in the case of a policy which may be expected to arouse organised opposition, it would be quite impossible to carry it out by wholesale eviction of those farmers who objected to It, especially as it would be practically impossible to replace them by better men. It seems clear, therefore, that if the Government decide that it is essential in the national interest that the programme proposed should be carried out, it would be necessary W continue in force the Regulations under the Defence of the Realm Act, under which the programme for 1918 has been carried out.    This can only be done by asking Parliament to postpone the operation of Part IV of the Corn Production Act for another year, so that the Defence of the Realm Regulations may remain in force until the 21st August, 1919, or the end of the war, whichever is the earlier.If it is decided to introduce a Bill with this object into Parliament, it would be well, in ^he f^rst instance, to discuss It with those members of the House of Lords who were concerned in the negotiations with the Government last year when the Corn Production Act was passed.     It would be necessary to ask them, In view of the continuance of the war and the serious situation as regards the food supply, to release the Board from the bargain made with them that the powers of the Board under the Defence of the Realm Regulations should expire in August next.It will be necessary in any event to obtain legislation this Session, as otherwise the Board would be unable to retain possession after the 21st August next of any of the land which has been taken over, either because it is badly farmed or because it was required for allotment purposes.     Further legislation would also be required if the Defence of the   Realm Regulations expire in August next, tn order to enable any additional land to be obtained for allotments after that date.     If, however, the operation of Part IV of the Cora Production Act Is postponed for another year and the Defence of the Realm Regulations remain in operation, no further legislation would be necessary for the two purposes mentioned above, and it is submitted, therefore, that from the Parliamentary point of view, the simplest and most satisfactory course would be to introduce a short Bill to amend Section (11) Sub-section (3) of the Corn Production Act by the substitution of &quot;two years&quot; for i!one year&quot;. The Sub-section would then read as follows&quot;(3) The powers under the Defence of the Realm Regulations &quot;exerciseable by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries with a &quot;view to maintaining the food supply of the country with respect &quot;to the matters dealt with in this Part of this Act shall cease &quot;to operate at the expirstion of two years from the passing of &quot;this Act or at the termination of the present war, whichever is &quot;the earlier, and thereupon this Part of this Act shall come into &quot;operation.&quot;
The 1918 Houghing Programme.In submitting the foregoing proposals for increasing the area under arable land in 1919, attention must be called to one or two matters arising out of the Ploughing Programme of this year.Labour.As the result of the tillage programme for the 1918 harvest a large addition has been made to the arable land of England and Wales.     It Is anticipated that the cultivation of the -increased area of arable land which must be prepared for the 1919 harvest will necessitate the provision of 12 to 15 per cent more manual labour than was required by the ploughing programme of the present season.     Most of this extra labour may be unskilled,&apos; and it is anticipated that much of it may be provided by women; but it must be made clear that in the Department&apos;s view the need for skilled labour on the new arable area will be greater next year than it is during the current season.Tractors.When the orders already placed have been completed, as it is expected they will be early In the autumn, the Department will have at least 8,000 tractors at disposal.     It has been assumed above that 4,000 will be employed on the new Programme; the remaining 4,000 will be available for the cultivation of existing tillage land.Fertilisers.The existing arable land might with advantage receive much more manure than can be provided in 1919; but the ploughing of permanent grass will not rob existing arable land; in some measure the addition of fresh land would, indeed, reduce the need for artificial manures.April 18th, 190&amp;.Food Production Department, 72, Victoria Street,s.w.(i).
