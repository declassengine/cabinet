G.T. 4480.2THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 8th May, 1918.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The Labour situation is discussed.Part II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press on military affairs, on munitions supply, on foreign affairs, on conscription, on trade policy, and on the Budget is described, and some criticisms of Government action are given.Part III: District Reports.The week has, on the whole, been quiet, but the May Day celebrations, and the trial of John McLean have given rise to considerable excitement in Scotland.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a stoppage of work. The strike at Messrs. Barclay, Curie and Co. continues. An important strike of builders at Liverpool has occurred, but has been settled.(b.) Not involving a stoppage of -work. There are two disputes, one on the sub-ject of dilution, the other owing to the employment of non-union men, which are of interest.  Neither is of great importance.I. General Remarks.The Labour Position.The abnormal calm of the past two months shows signs of coming to an end. There are indications in several quarters of the recrudescence of industrial trouble. Of these the immediately most important is the agitation for the release of John McLean, the well-known Scottish agitator, to which reference is made in Part III of this Report, The speeches made at the meeting at Glasgow Green on the 5th instant are stated to have been of the most violent nature, and action was taken to arouse similiar excitement in Edinburgh, and to organise an important agitation on the 9th May, the day of McLean&apos;s trial.The second symptom of incipient unrest is evident in the May Day celebration, also on the Cylde, The demonstration was well organised, and important in point of numbers, the estimated attendance being 50,000. It is, however, interesting to note that with the exception of an affirmation of the solidarity of the workers of the world, no actual reference to war and peace was made in the resolution. In England, on the other hand, the demonstrations on May Day were of little importance, and at Leicester, which is usually regarded in the light of the stronghold of the Independent Labour Party, the meeting, which was addressed by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, was a distinct failure, and was broken up by a patriotic party. Mr. Macdonald finally escaped under police escort.
The third cause of trouble is the prospective extension of conscription to Ireland, to which strenuous objection is made by the extremist party in several parts of England. It is noticeable, however, that on the Clyde, where Irish workmen are most numerous, objection to conscription in Ireland on the part of their fellow-workmen appears to be specially weak.Lastly, there is a continued agitation in Lanarkshire on the subject of the new Military Service Act, and attempts have been made to arrange a line of action with South Wales in opposition to its provisions. It is not anticipated that these attempts will have much success, in view of the large numbers of voluntary enlistments in Wales, but local trouble in Scotland is possible, the mining area of Lanarkshire having been sedulously cultivated by John McLean and other extremists from the Clyde and by the Women&apos;s Peace Crusade.Taking these various symptions into consideration, it seems probable that the peaceful conditions which have recently obtained in the industrial world are unlikely to continue.II. Press Comments.Military Affairs.Labour and Socialist papers contain practically no criticism of military dis-positions. The &quot; New Statesman,&quot; however, compares the German position with the British a year ago, and praises the staff work of the Second Army. An interesting article in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; while dismissing the actual fighting as ;i bloody lunacy,&quot; describes a journey to the front, the life of preparation, and the life of recuperation. The writer refers to a vast space in the human mind, formerly ignored, but now studied in the army to keep men fit mentally as well as physically. The &quot; Call &quot; laments that an allied counter-attack is to be expected, which will add to the slaughter, and summons the workers of the world to demand peace.Munitions Supply.A further scathing attack is made by &apos;: Justice &quot; on the statement of the Minister of Munitions in the House of Commons, on the ground that this contained no clear assertion of the sufficiency of the supply of guns and shells. It is also noted that most of the praise was given to officials and labour, while the employers have not received their fair share.foreign Affairs.Much space is given to May Day, and its significance from the point of view oi the Internationale, and to the centenary of Marx, which is referred to more par-ticularly by the &quot; Call &quot; in a large number of articles. In the &quot; Herald &apos;&apos; May Day is the text for much general pacifist argument, and an appeal for re-establishment of the Internationale on a workable scheme. The workers of Germany and Austria are justified in their fight against black Czardom. The &quot;Labour Leader &quot; complains that no practical steps seem to have been taken to carry out the decision of the Inter-Allied Labour and Socialist Conference,Interest in the Emperor of Austria&apos;s letter continues. The Herald &quot; and the &quot; Call&quot; describe with approbation the investigation by the French Committee on Foreign Affairs. It is a ground for complaint that the allied Governments were kept in ignorance, and the policy of Mr. Lloyd George and M. Clemenceau is held responsible for wantonly and criminally rejecting an excellent opportunity for peace on satisfactory terms.Attacks on the American Labour Deputation appear in the &quot; Herald,&quot; &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; and &quot; Call.&quot; The first stigmatises it as of the same bogus character as British deputations to Russia and the States. The &quot; Call &quot; advises it to return and take up the reconstruction of the Workers&apos; International. Mr. Brailsford, in the &quot; Herald,&quot; denounces as insufficient the American production of aeroplanes and artillery, and suggests that instead of relying on America the Government should have accepted the Austrian peace offer.Russia is generally neglected, but the &quot; Clarion &apos;&apos; uses its state of chaos to warn pacifists in. England, and in particular at Keighley.
Ireland.Interest in Ireland lias declined, possibly because it is thought that conscription is no longer meant. The &quot; Herald &quot; thinks the situation better, owing to the efforts of the Joint Executive of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee. The &quot;&quot; Labour Leader &quot; is impressed by the one-day strike, and believes the Bill may already be deemed certain of failure. A darker picture is drawn in &quot; Irish Notes &quot; of the fiercely hostile and united spirit of Irish workers. In a letter to this paper, the writer alleges that troops, armoured trains, barbed wire, and machine guns are ready, and Lord Milner has been specially appointed to carry out a policy of coercion.Conscription.Comment on the Man-Power Act is now limited to details. The ;&quot; Co-operative News &quot; asks for a clear definition of the terms &apos;: shop assistants &quot; and &quot; branch managers.&quot; The &quot; Herald &quot; remarks on the proposal to form a Royal Marine Engineer Corps in dockyards under military discipline, and on the calling up of policemen in Manchester who had joined the National Union of Police Officers.Criticism of Government.Executive actions rather than general policy are the chief target this week. The &apos;&quot; Labour Leader &quot; and the &quot; Herald &quot; denounce raids on the extremist press, and the latter claims that Lord Northcliffe and his like have liberty of action which is denied to Labour and pacifist newspapers. Recent resignations, with one exception, are freely criticised. The &quot; New Age &quot; thinks that in conflicts between civil and military authorities the wrong expert has always had to go. It prophesies that Mr. Lloyd George will owe his fall chiefly to Sir Edward Carson, not to the pacifists. Lord Rothermere&apos;s resignation is accepted with joy. Regret at Lord Rhondda&apos;s departure is shared by the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; (which hopes Mr. Ciynes will succeed him) and by the &quot; Co-operator.&quot;Trade Policy.The Clarion &quot; praises the report of the Balfour Committee on commercial and industrial policy as so moderate that it will not commend itself to fanatics at either extreme. On the other hand, the &quot; Herald &quot; deplores the prospect of the continuance of the monstrosities which led to war.The Budget.No new points are taken, but the &quot;Herald,&quot; &quot;New Age,&quot; and &quot;Leeds Citizen &quot; repeat complaints against raising postal rates and taxing sugar. Both the &quot; New Age &quot; and &quot; Co-operative News &quot; regard present methods of taxation as insufficient in view of the burden of debt, and favour a levy on capital.III. District Reports. London and South-Eastern. -The situation in this area remains normal, and little unrest is reported.No general discontent is anticipated over man-power, but some trouble may arise among the woodworkers, owing to jealousy of the engineers, and the fear that the latter may receive preferential treatment from the Government. Among the older men at Cubitt&apos;s there is also some grumbling at the non-calling up of the younger men who hold protection cards, since the older men were unable.to apply for such cards under the last Military Service Act.The May Hay Demonstration at the Holborn Hall was no great success, as the attendance included only about 150. A resolution was adopted sending fraternal greetings to the workers of all countries, including enemy nations. Wreaths were placed on Karl Marx&apos;s grave at Highgate, but no demonstration was permitted.The ex-shop steward, George Stubbs, is still active at Woolwich, and continues to make public attacks upon the competence of the Arsenal officials.
West Midlands.Matters in this district are on the whole quiet, though some slight discontent has arisen.At Birmingham much grumbling has been caused by the increase of the tram fares; the Trades Council is to be consulted upon this question, and trouble raay ensue if the Corporation officials refuse to reconsider their decision. At the Dunlop Works there is dissatisfaction over the date from which the 12^ per cent, bonus is being paid.Several shop stewards, who have recently been dismissed from Coventry firms, are reported to be approaching prominent pacifists with a view to the protection of their own class from military service. No more serious agitation on the subject of man-power seems, however, to have arisen.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Some agitation has been apparent in this district during the week, though it does not seem to be of a very serious nature.Pacifism in the Leicester area is at present at a low ebb, and at a May Day Demonstration on the 5th Mr. Ramsay Macdonald proved entirely unable to obtain a hearing, whilst the protection of a strong guard of police was found necessary. May Day was celebrated in Leeds by a meeting organised by the Trades Council and Labour Party, at which about 500 persons were present. The speakers followed me usual lines of attacks upon capitalism, and were subject to slight interruption. On the whole, however, the meeting passed off quietly, and a resolution was passed in favour of control of industry by the workers, and endorsing the War Aims of the Labour Party.The Leeds Socialist Labour Party and the Plebs League also organised a demon-stration in Leeds on the occasion of the Marxian Centenary. At this meeting some-what revolutionary speeches were made, which included bitter criticism and ridicule of Mr. Lloyd George, and which, as usual, attributed the continuance of the war to a desire for gain on the part of the ruling class.At Bradford the Trades Council passed a resolution describing conscription in Ireland as the greatest crime which has been committed. The A.S.E. of Sheffield have voted a lew of 3d. per member for strikers in Wexford.The activities of the reconstituted Labour Party in Leeds still continue, and various candidates have been selected for the future election.N orth-W estern.The improvement in the general situation in this district, to which reference was made last week, seems to have been generally maintained. Little unrest is reported apart from the dispute with the builders at Liverpool, which is dealt with elsewhere.   In Manchester there is ill-feeling between the A.S.E. and unskilled men.The award to the dockers is apparently giving great satisfaction.At Barrow the inefficiency of the tram service has caused discontent, especiallv among workers at VickersLIn Liverpool a claim is made that sales of bacon should no longer be subject to a ration limit.Northern.The situation in this area still continues to be very quiet.At Messrs. Armstrong^ Elswick Works, however, considerable discussion has arisen among the A.S.E., who claim that War Munition Volunteers under the new Man-Power Bill, many of whom obtained work through the Employment Exchanges, should be taken for military service before the members of the A.S.E.South Wales.Satisfactory reports have been received from this district, and very little labour unrest is evident.The strikes supposed to be in sympathy with A. J. Cook are not serious. Many men who have been earning high wages came out merely for a holiday, and went back.
Pacifism has not apparently increased in strength lately, while recent prose-cutions seem to have been of service in checking its growth. A considerable under-current of such opinion still, however, exists in the Rhondda Valley and Glamor-i 3 3 \jganshire. Scotland.Considerable excitement over May Day prevailed throughout this district dur-ing the week, though little industrial unrest is reported.The Glasgow demonstration was attended by about 50,000 people, including representatives of every trade and yard. The procession met with some opposition from wounded soldiers, but was otherwise of a moderately orderly nature; at the Green platforms were provided for 21 bodies, among which were the Trades Council, the A.S.E., the Industrial Workers of Great Britain, the Labour Party, and Co-operative Societies, &amp;c. The meeting ultimately adopted a resolution send-ing fraternal greetings to the workers of the world, and pledging themselves to &quot; effect the emancipation of labour from the domination of capitalism,&quot; while the co-operative societies passed an additional resolution of protest against the applica-tion of the Excess Profits Tax to the savings of co-operative societies.At Hamilton in Lanarkshire a similar meeting was attended by the majority of the miners of the district.Agitation is now on foot over the arrest of John McLean, and a meeting of several thousand workers at Glasgow on the 5th pledged themselves to demand his release, while the general attitude of the meeting was very threatening. The order to the well-known conscientious objector, Councillor Rfegan, which prevents his return to Rutherglen, is also leading to considerable agitation.Pacifist agitation seems to be reviving in this district, and the Workers&apos; Peace Committee, representing such bodies as the Glasgow Trades Council, the I.L.P., and the B.S.P., have been drafting their plans for a peace propaganda campaign as soon as a favourable opportunity presents itself.The Clyde Workers&apos; Committee have received a letter from the London Com-mittee, stating that the National Committee of Shop Stewards are prepared to adopt drastic action if conscription were enforced in Ireland. The general opinion in the district is, however, that the measure is fair, and will relieve Scotland of interlopers.iv. Disputes. (a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The general situation appears to be slightly more disturbed than has been the case for some weeks past, though no very serious disputes have yet arisen.The Shipyard Labour Department reports 11 new cases of stoppage of work, involving 1,029 men, while 11 earlier cases remained unsettled; work has been resumed in 15 cases.At Messrs. Workman, Clark, and Co., Belfast, unrest has again occurred, and J40 members of the N.A.U.L. ceased work in the boiiershop owing to workmen of another society being employed on similar work. The matter has been referred to the Controller-General of Merchant Shipping.The strike at Messrs. Barclay, Curie, and Co., Whiteinch, to which reference was made last week, still continues. The matter is being dealt with by the Controller-General of Merchant Shipping.The Ministry of Munitions reports 2,951 workpeople involved in strikes for the week ending May 1st.It is satisfactory to note, however, that on the 3rd May only one strike on munition work still continued. The total number of workpeople involved in the month of April was 8,212. The strikes include several short stoppages with regard to the 12^ per cent, bonus, and two upon the subject of dilution. At the Aircraft Factory, Waddon, another short stoppage has occurred of 230 woodworkers owing to the firm&apos;s refusal to dismiss a discharged soldier, who was alleged to be unskilled and a non-union man. A threat of prosecution induced them to return to work. The strike of electricians at Chilwell, which threatened to extend over the country, has ended for the present in the reinstatement of the men dismissed with the exception of one shop steward, but further enquiry is being made.
A strike of about 4,000 builders has taken place at Liverpool, of whom only 240 were directly engaged upon munition work. The claim of the men for a large increase was dealt with by the Liverpool Conciliation Board, which made a settlement, and work was resumed. The rate fixed is, however, so high that labour elsewhere may be unsettled, and enquiries are still proceeding. The Government may be forced to take drastic action to prevent such agreements being made without regard to their effect upon other sections of industry.The War Office Contracts Department reports only 2 new strikes and 2 un-settled from previous weeks.   Three were settled.The woolcombers employed by Isaac Holden and Sons, Bradford, struck work on the question of the liability of the firm to make good deficiencies in wages caused by working short time under the new levy scheme. The firm alleged that this was due to shortage il coal; the operatives stated that it was caused by a shortage of raw material. Work has been resumed, but the trouble appears to be still unsettled.A dispute involving a stoppage of work has arisen regarding the price of making Army pants at Messrs. Tyler and Sons, Kimberley.The Coal Controller has 6 new stoppages of work to report, involving in all about 12,145 men.   Work has been resumed in 4 cases.Two further stoppages in connection with recruiting are reported in Yorkshire. Apart from the numbers mentioned above, about 7,000 men in South Wales and about 50,000 in Lanarkshire were idle on the 1st May.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Shipyard Labour Department reports 30 new controversial cases, and 89 which have been previously mentioned.   Settlements have been effected in 35 cases.The boilermakers employed by Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., Barrow, have threatened to strike if non-union men who have been released from Eipon Camp and sent to the firm as riveters are retained, while riveters who are members of the Boilermakers&apos; Society are left in the Army.   The local shipyard labour officials are now dealing with the matter.There is also dissatisfaction among the boilermakers at Southampton, owing to a dispute regarding-the os. award of March 1917.The Ministry of Munitions reports that the dispute at the Belsize Motor Com-paw, Manchester, has once more broken out, as the men persist in their attitude upon the question of dilution, and the demand that all the semi-skilled men shall be removed.   The matter was to be further discussed on the 7th May.At the Electric Car Company, Preston, a strike is threatened against a system of pay-ment by results among the woodworkers employed on sea-planes, the union being anxious to adopt a system of time work.The War Office Contracts Department reports only one new controversial case, while no cases remain unsettled from previous weeks.In this dispute the British Association of Wool Buyers have decided that they cannot grant advances claimed &apos;by warehousemen and wool sorters.The Coal Controller has no controversial cases to report; 7 cases remain un-settled from previous weeks.The Committee on Production has heard 54 arbitration cases during the past week: 36 in London, 3 at Newcastle, and 13 in Scotland. In addition, sitting as a special arbitration tribunal, the Committee has heard 2 cases arising out of the 12-^ per cent, orders.New differences reported to the Chief Industrial Commissioner for the week ending 4th May number 145; of these 51 are claims for the 12-1 per cent, bonus.The most important to which reference is made were the disputes in the build-ing trade at Liverpool, and a general demand for the 12^ per cent, bonus to un-skilled and semi-skilled workers on aircraft work; this latter claim has been referred to arbitration.D. J. SHACKLETON.
