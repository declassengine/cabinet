/   &apos; ITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AMI C MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)SECRET,% &apos;    &apos; WAR   CABINET.%,T,-4411.DESPATCH OF Alt ERI CAN TROOPS. Telegram from Lord Reading to Foreign Office.Decypher,   Lnrd Reading. (Washington).   April 30th, 1918. R. 8.0.a.m. May 1st, 1918.No, 1894.Your telegram 2545.1.     It is disappointing to find, that after trouble and effort expended to get agreement with Secretary Baker, which we were extending very considerably in our favour,, it has been so materially altered by agreement between Lord Milner and General Pershing,Of course Lord Milner must know best what is required, but it is unfortunate we were not informed earlier of negotiations- and agreement more particularly as in addition to Prime Minister^ cables to me General Bridges and Hutchinson and Graeme Thomson had 3uch specific instructions to arrange for shipment of infajQ^y men and machine gun units only,. (? Of course)   we shall do ou  best here to make new agreement work to best advantage^2..    Secretary Baker informed me yesterday that he was prepared to accept convoys of 11-^ knots s^ed and would have given official answer to-day but that a new proposal was now made which was being enquired into..   It is for- departures alternatively from New York and Halifax..     This raises difficult question of rail transportation which makes re( ?arrangement) necessary and until Chief of Staff reports upon proposal Secretary Baker cannot answer..3..     After consultation with Graeme Thomson I made formal request of- Secretary Baker- (? yesterday) for shipment of 700,000 troops during May,, June and: July in British and American tonnage,, viz:-.In British ships:-           May __________________.. 130,000June................. 150,.000July________________ 150,.000In American ships:-         May.................. 95,000June..._____________ 80..000July . ,.....------- 95, 000making grand total for three months of&apos; 700,;000..Secretary Baker will communicate official answer to me.4...    Secretary Baker- informed me that notwithstanding modified agreement infantrymen and machine gun units already under orders for embarkation in May will be sent forward as originally intended and this for reasons of convenience,.
5.     Prom my information less than 500,000 infantrymen and machine gun units shipped from April to end of July would exhaust present supply.I was anxious as were also Bridges, Hutohinson and Graeme Thomson to get United States War Department to ship largest possible number of these infantry and machine gun units in May and June but modified programme alters this.
