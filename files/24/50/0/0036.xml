SIS DOOTMBfll IS TBS OF HIS MAJESTY1S (WTOBIOTT)(J.1,4436IjM vairt-n-------1 -r - ii ii i ii 11 mi ii w  urmjMemorandum by Lord Bebcrt OeoiL(Circulated v/ith reference to jjfcr Cabinet 404 ^ Minute 15).At the mooting of the Cabinet held on Friday, May 3rd, this subject \7as discussed in the absence of any representative, of the Foreign Office or of the Ministry of Blockade.    Possibly for that reason the Cabinet appears to have been under the im-pression - (1) thr.t it was possible to contend that the recently signed Norwegian aftreeiacirc gave some right to the British Government to object uo the purchase and storage in Eorv/ay of pyrites by Gorman interests, and (2) that there was some possibility of obtaining the pyrites for a lower price than that at present proposed.    There docs not seem any foundation for oithor of. these impressions,     $ho Uorwogian-Jbaerican agreement only $sale with the erport of pyritos and for us to suggest that it also covered its purchase and storage vsould    azerely expose us to a charge of attempted sharp practice.    As to the price, m havo been repeatedly   assured by Sir H.findlay, who ie not likely to be mistaken on such a point, that it only exceeds tha cost of production with a small additional profit.By a telegram received since the mooting of the Cabinet, he tells us that enemy agents are offering double the price in question for storage till after the war.    It is clear therefore that if the offer is refused by us, the pyrites will bo bought by the Germans - a result vfoieh I venture to think would be very unfortunate,I hope   therefore that the matter vail be roeonsj&amp;orod on Monday.Extracts from telegrams from Christiania, ate. bearing on the question of price and on the importance attached by the Germans to Horwegian pyrites are attached.1?0I$IG*] OFFICE,4th May, 1918
MCLGSUEB.  tracts   from   correspondence.1,     Sir II. Plnd-lay^fi telegram Ho. 1281 very urgent of April 22nd.Following from Ur. Hunter ( the expert sent out by thoMinistry of Munitions to conclude the contract).........&quot;Aboveprices are loss than those ruling in Scandinavia. Benjamin ? the expert acting on behalf of the German Government) has arrived at Stockholm and is requesting interviews with both Associations to discuss present and future business. Above terms are absolute minimum. Please telegraph authority to close or reject as no counter-proposals or modifications will be considered.     Hatter is most urgent&quot;.Comment of Sir LI, JPindlay on above.&quot;I understand above prices for sulphur are not materially in excess of local cost of production at present time.     Latter is certain to increase during continuance of hostilities so that terms are as favourable as can reasonably be expected&quot;.2*     Sir II. FindlayTs telegram Ho-. 1282 of ^pril 22nd.ifrom Lr. Bell (representative of ministry of Munitions) for ministry of munitions.&quot;Having been present during detailed Pyrites negotiations, it is obvious to me that unless you accept terms conveyed in Huntor1s todayTs message Norwegian pyrites praluation will go toGermany after the war......     Every clause of the contract hasbeen fought for and Hunter&apos;s telegram represents best conditions obtainable,I must emphasise that a prompt reply authorising clean acceptance is imperative&quot;.3.     SiUr II. findlay*s telegram Ho. 1314 very urgent of April 25th. &quot;&quot;*I am informed that pyrites completing deliveries under original contract is now awaiting shipment so that danger of export to Germany is imminent.I also learn that Llr, Lenander of Orkla Company (the biggest Norwegian pyrites mine) states that he will have conference on x.pril 28th with Benjamin in Stockholm.Very early decision on proposals in my telegram above mentioned is therefore urgently desirable&quot;.4.     Sir K. $indlaytg telegram Ho. 1337 of April 27th.HI am informed on reliable authority that German agents have now made firm offer to both Pyrites associations for entire surplus output.     They propose to take delivery in Norway where mineral would be stored until it could bo exported.Prices
Prices offered are higher than those mentioned in my telegram 1281.&quot;5.     Sir l t Findlay&apos; s telegram unnumbered of April 29.&quot;Urgent,   Pyrites Associations have intimated that their offer is only open up to the end of this week.&quot;6.     Sir M. Fin&amp;lay&apos;s telegram Uo. 1354.&quot;I do not *eee how we can expect much more favourable terms for reasons stated in ......   my telegram No.1281,......   In any case delay appears most dangerous in view ofGerman offers.&quot;7,     Sir M. Findlay&apos;s telegram No.1399 of May 3rd..............&quot;Even if extension of time is obtaineddelay would still be dangerous as I learn on good authority that enemy agents are offering two crowns per unit of sulphur for pyrites to be stored until after the war.   This is double the price mentioned in Associations&apos; offer to Mr. Hunter.&quot;8.     Translation of extract from the German newspaper &quot;Hamburg!schor  Correspondent&quot; of April 4, 1918.&quot; he only State import organisation which has come into being is for pyrites, of which German industry requires considerable quantities,   louring the war Norway has been in part a source of supply, but at present the Norwegian pyrites are wholly in English hands. (This refers to the Ministry of Munitions&apos; contract which has just expired).     That is why official rationing of the imported quantities is unavoidable.&quot;
