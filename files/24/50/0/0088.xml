(RepbJ^yTf lating to the War Work of the Board of Agriculture forScotland for week ending 8th May, 1918.2Q 0I.   POOD PRODUCTION.A welcome change in the weather has taken plaoe.   The cold and drought experienced during most of April has after a considerable rainfall given plaoe to milder weather, and the improvement that has taken plaoe in the appearance of pastures is very marked.      The corn braird has also benefited much by the advent of favourable conditions.     In the south-western district of Scotland where there is normally a considerable rainfall during the month of April, the total fall was less than .7 of an inch and east winds prevailed on 24 out of the 30 days of the month.Potato planting is practically completed and the necessary work in preparation of the turnip crop is being proceeded with.1.   Compulsory Orders tm&amp;er Defends of the Realm Regulation 2M.During the week the Board issued an Order in the following case:-Section (1) (e)   farm of lower Whitefield   -  Kincardineshire.2.

The total increased cultivation in 1918 over the 1916 figures was estimated at 366,650 acres.     Prom returns received from District Agricultural Executive Committees it is anticipated that the actual increase of cultivated land in 1918 will be approximately 300,000 acres as compared with 1916.   The greater part of this increased acreage is in the best grain growing counties.     The highland and mountainous districts of the south and west will fall short of the quota allocated to them.3.   Programme for 1918-19.The Board have at present under consideration their programme for Increased Pood Production in 1918-19 particularly in regard to (1) the increased cultivation to be overtaken (2) the regulation of the use of grass parks and (3) the constitution and operations of the District Agricultural Executive Committees.4.

A copy of the circular is atta6hed.5.

BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FOR SCOTLAND, 29 St. Andrew Square, EDINBURGH:    7th May. 1918.Sir,I am directed by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland to state that, as your Committee Is probably aware, the provisions of part IV. of the Corn Production Act, 1917, conferring on the Board certain powers to enforce proper cultivation, will come into force on August 2l8t of this year and that as the Act contemplates the Board for this purpose continuing to secure the co-operation of Local Agricultural Committees, they propose to take this opportunity of considering on what basis such local co-operation shall be secur-:ed during the four years from that date in whioh the Act will re-:main in force.Section 11 of the Act authorises the Board to make reguia-jtions for the constitution and procedure of any bodies of this kind and provides that the first set of persons constituting a local body of this kind shall in whole or part consist of the Agricultural Executive Committees in being immediately before August 21st, 1918. This Section also provides that a county shall be the smallest area for which a Committee shall be formed.The Board have therefore decided, as this provision entails a rearrangement of the basis on which the present Committees have been formed in most Scottish Counties, to take this opportunity of reconstituting the Committees generally, keeping in view at the      -; same time that in some respects the work of such Committees for the next few years cannot be in all respects identical with that which they have been doing for the seasons 1917 and 1918.Generally the Board are disposed to constitute the new dounty Committees - which In some cases may indeed cover areas of grouped counties - on a more uniform and systematic principle than was followed in setting up the original Committees at the beginning of 1917.     At the same time the Board are fully alive to the import-:ance of securing a measure of continuity between the composition ..: of the existing and the nsw Committees.After considering various methods of constitution the Board are disposed to think that the Committees should be formed on a     :.; direct representative basis, such representation including the several interests concerned in agriculture, and they would be pre-:pared to give the largest share of representation on the Committees to occupiers of agricultural holdings.     They would propose at the same time to seoure adequate representation for the other classes of the agricultural community, and they have an interest in making sure that representatives of farm workers shall have a voice in the proceedings of the Committees.The Board will be glad therefore to consider any represent-tations from your Committee with regard to the constitution of the reformed Committees, and in particular they will be glad to have the views of your Committee on -(1)/Secretary,District Agricultural Executive Committee.
(l) the size of a Committee of an average County as e.g. Lanark.or Forfar, having regard to the number and size of the agricultural: holdings, and the agrlcuit- &apos; Jural population of the.area, and to&apos;the&quot;possibility , of appointing DistriotVSub-Conmiitteesj&apos; i    -(2) the distribution of representation as between the dif-:ferent sections of the agricultural community,&apos;(3) the most suitable arrangements for grouping the smaller counties, together or with their larger neighbours, so far as this question affects the area of your Committee.I am, Sir,your obedient Servant,CHAS. WEATHERILL,Secretary.
