PERSONNEL OP THE SAWrAdmiralty Memorandum!^ the   War Cabinet..The question of the Navy using men other than Grade Ic was discussed by the War Cabinet last month,, and I undertook to go into the question again..A summary of the total numbers borne (exclusive of the Royal Naval A1f Service and the Anti-Aircraft Corps which are no longer under the Admiralty) marked &quot;A&quot; is attached.     On the 15th February last the numbers amounted to 378,000. The following is a broad division, of these numbers:-Sea-geing duties 250,300.Permanent Shore Establishment. 21,900.H.M.S. &quot;President&quot;. 2,600.Qualifying, Under trainingsAwaiting draft ete.       &apos; 59,200*Boom Defence Vessels, Harbour,and other non-sea-going duties. 3,300*Royal Marines ashore, and R.M-Labour Corps., Home Ports. 9,500.Royal Marines in Prance andother Theatres of W ar. 4,000.R.S.D*, and R.M. Labour- Corpsin France. 15,400.R.N.D., Home Depot. 8,500.Coast Guard on shore. 5,500.        40,700.Total. 3TO.0OO-The opinion hitherto) held by the Board of Admiralty has been that men who have to serve on board H.M. Ships at sea should be fit men no matter what the nature of their duties may be, and until recently this, standard was adhered to in all new entries whether for &quot;continuous service&quot; or for &quot;hostilities only&quot;.The question was, however, reconsidered in view Iof the existing Man-power conditions, by the Board of Admiralty and the Medical Consultative Board, and it has been agreed that mem   I with certain defects, such as hammer toes, loss of index finger, etc., etc., may be accepted for continuouLS service in the - 1following Ratings ?.-Ships Cooks.Victualling Staff, Writers.Sick Berth StaffOfficersp Stewards and Cooks.The Medical Consultative Beard is of the opinion that the standard should not be lowered for any other ratings entering for continuouja service.   A signed report by this- Boar$ marked &quot;B&quot; is attached.
With regard to men entering for hostilities only, or men already In the Service, it has been decided that the above disabilities, to which have been added certain others, shall not bo regarded as causes for rejection or invaliding out m the Service.These decisions haxre been embodied in instructions Issued to Recruiting Officers (copy Marked 11C&quot; attached).It must always be kept in mind that service in the smaller craft cf H.M. Navy is a severe physical test and - strain, and that the whole of the Ratings to which this reduction in standard applies have stations allotted to them when the ship Is in action, and numbers of men with these defects can only be absorbed gradually, if the fighting efficiency of the Fleet is not to be unduly impaired.     A good deal of consideration will have to be given to individual cases.The numbers on the Permanent Shore Establishment were classified according to age and medical category In December last, and it was found that 5,258 were men lowep than Class it, and of the remainder in Glass I 5,095 were over 40 years of age.     Sinee that time all entries to Shore Establish-mentis, of Ships&apos; Cooks, Victualling Staff, Writers, Sick Berth Staff&apos;, Officersr Stewards and Cooks, have been drawn from men classified not higher than Grade III.     I intend to have a further classification of the men ashore made in the return for the 15th May, to see to what extent it has been possible to dilute the numbers of fit men on Shore Establishments * It must be stated, however, that for a large number of the posts considerable technical knowledge is essential., and unfit men with the necessary qualifications are not available.     The 2, 00 borne on the books of the &quot;President&quot; include about 500 Officers employed at the Admiralty^ the majority of whom are unfit for sea; about 250 Officers   at bases round the Coast or employed as Overseer in various Yards, and upwards of 1,000 employed on special work* the greater part being abroad.The largest proportion of tho numbers on shore are either qualifying, Under training, Awaiting Draft, etc.,     These amount to 59,200.     Of this number 6,500 are Cadets, or youths and boys, from whom continuous service Officers and men -are mainly recruited.     This leaves a balance of 52,900.     It will be obvious that these must have the same degree of fitness as the crews actually at sea, as they will all either fill vacancies in the Fleet or form the crews of ships to be commissioned, but the exceptions accepted by the Medical Consultative Board will apply to these men in similar- proportions as to the men afloat.     I have had this figure of 52,900 carefully analysed, and enclose a summary marked &quot;D&quot; showing how they are principally employed. This, summary shows the numbers in the main groups as follows:-Preliminary training. 6,200.Specialist training. 10,400. Appropriated for shipsabout to Commission. 9,700.Available for draft. 10,500. In Hospital, Detention,On leave, Passage, etc. 8,800. Lent to Ships and Basesfor special duties. 5,600.The numbers under preliminary and specialist training amount to 16,600.     Considerable time is required for specialist courses in Gunnery, Torpedo Work, Submarine duties and Wireless; and I am advised that the numbers under training barely admit of an output of efficient Officers and men at a rate which will enablefuture/

In specialist ratings the Navy is quite different from the Army, the proportion of skilled to unskilled ratings being prspenderatingly higher.     The only real reserve behind the Fleet consists of the numbers &quot;available for draf&apos;&amp;&quot; which amount to 10,500, and only represent five to six weeksr future requirements both for replacements of casualties and manning of additional vessels as they become available4 Compared with the numbers afloat this reserve is equal to roughly four per cent.     The conditions in the Navy obviously differ materially from those in the Army.     A Battalion 50% strong is half a Battalion^*   A ship half-manned Is useless , and a grel^t waste of production^Of the 3^300 engaged on Boom Defence Vessels, Harbour, and other non-sea-goinn duties, 700 are retired Officers or Pensioners.    Wherever possible unfit men are appointed for1 these duties, and I am advised that the numbers of fit men of military age are very small.     I am arranging for a complete analysis of these men according to age and physical fitness in the Return for the Iffith May*With regard to the remaining items, (Royal Marines, R.N.D., etc*,) it will be seen that 19,400 are in France, or Elsewhere abroad, and there is a further number of 18,000 ashore and in the Home Depot, including Headquarters Establishments, unfit?- men, and men training for France, etc.The Royal Marine Labour Corps is recruited from men net fit for General Service, in exactly the same way as the Army Labour Corps *The Coast Guards are men over age.The Cabinet may rest assured that every opportunity is being taken to effect dilution by over-ago or unfit? men, and also, by the W.R.N.S., and requirements to the end of 1918 have, been reduced by between two and three thousand, in the hope that dilution to this extent can be effected.
