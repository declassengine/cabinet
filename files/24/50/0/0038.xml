pftJiABjftp^fa -MEMORANDUM FOR THE WAR CABINET,^/a ft&amp;ve read.the memoranaum by the Minister of ^^ilj^.ns1:ruction (G.Ti4386). on the draft Migration Bill.I agree with Dr. Addison as to our policy with regard to emigration, hut I cannot concur in his view that the proposed constitution of the Central Authority wvll adversely affect that policy, and still less that the in-clusicn of two Agents General on the Board would have this effect.. , I have informed the Cabinet in my memorandum of the 27th of March how it is intended that the Board shall be constituted, and it seems to me that the presence on the Board of representatives of the Home Office, Board of Trade, Local G-overnment Board, Board of Agriculture and Ministry of Labour, will sufficiently secure that the interests of this country are not subordinated to those of the Dominions.I.have also pointed out that the Bill in its present shape has the approval of the seven Departments con cerned, and I must press the Cabinet to approve the early introduction of this measure,    Dr. Addispn&apos;s suggestions as to drafting amendments will be considered with the Parliamentary Counsel,In present conditions it seems possible that an early opportunity may arise for securing the second reading of the Bill, which is a matter of much interest to the House of Commons, and I regard it as. important that the second reading should be taken before the meeting of the Imperial War Conference.W.H.L.. 4, 5. 18.*1
