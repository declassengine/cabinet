IS E C S I $ .G.T. 446?,,INTER-ALLY COUNCIL AffD I3T3R-ALLY &quot;* EXECUTIVES. &apos;Report by Mr. Chamberlain.1.     On April 16th I circulated a Minute, covering a letter from Profmssor Attolico, on the subject of the requirements of the Allied Governments (Paper G.T. 4247),     The War Cabinet on April lBth gave me authority to arrange a Conference on the subject between the Departments conoemed (War Cabinet 394, Minute 10).2.     Two meetings of the Conference have been held and a number of papers on the subject, including recent telegrams received from Lord Reading, Nos, 1742 and 1880, General Pershing^ letter to the Prime Minister (Paper GiT. 4430) and a Note from the French I  Embassy in London, dated 3rd May, in which it was urged that the British Government should adhere to the recent decisions of the Allied Maritime Transport Council held on April 23rd/25th in Paris and the Resolutions themselves, have been under conaidera-tion.3.     It appeared frep the above documents that the major portion of the ground had already been   covered by the decisions accepted by the Allied Delegates at the Allied Maritime Transport Council. The Conference found themselves in agreement with these Resolutions and recommend them for approval.     I may add that, after the second Meeting of the Conference, Mr. Oravath called upon me with two of the American. Delegates to express his opinion that the American Government would insist upon the creation of expert bodies whioh oould effectively examine the resources and pro-grammes of the Allies in so far as they required Ameroian co-operation.4.     The course which approved itself to the Conference and which is recommended to the Cabinet, is that^Programme Committees should be&quot; est tabliahed &apos;for &quot;this&quot; purposeHDn the &quot; lines &quot;&quot;set but &quot;below.    We advise the use of the term &quot;Programme Committee&quot; rather than &quot;Executive&quot;, because the former term better expresses their real function and powers.    It is recognised that in many oases the Committees will have no exeoutive authority, nor can they have the final power of determining the allocation of supplies amongst the Allies.    But it is believed that if agreement is reached in these Programme Committees, their conclusions will in practice be accepted by the different Governments and will form an agreed basis for the work of the Allied Maritime Transport Council and the Inters Ally Council on v/ar Purchases and Finance, to the respective offices of which in London the conclusions of the Committees should be transmitted.    The Committees them-selves should sit in London.v  5.    In the establishment of the Programme Committees, the j  Conference reoommend that, as far as possible, existing machinery &apos;  should be used.    Machinery does in fact already exist in some form or other for the control of practically every class of im-ported commodities.     What is required is   that an effective Inter-Ally character should be given to them where they do not already possess it.
6,    ^ha^OiQwfqrft^fl rMtm^^a that these commodities should be grouped dapartraeirtelly(a) The WAR OFFICE weuLdLjaake arrangements, for an AlliedProgramme Committee or Committees to CKrasi4er the Allied requirements as regards Wool, Leather, Jute and flax,(b) The BOARD Of TRADE would arrange for similar Committeesfor Ootton, Tobacoo, Matches, Timber and Paper.-.(o) The MINISTRY OF SHIPPING would arrange with the Goal Controller for coal,(d) The ROYAL COMMISSION ob SUGAR SUPPLIES would arrangefor Sugar.(e) The PETROLEUM EXECUTIVE for Mineral Oils.(f) The RUBBER AND TIB C0M&amp;UTT3E, under the Chairmanship ofLord ,Balfour of Burleigh, for Rubber and Tin.(g) The MINISTRY OF K)OD xgs Oil Seeds,(h) Meats and ^ats, Cereals, and Nitrates are alreadycovered by Executives,It is open to question whether the Cereals, Meats and Fats, and Oil Seeds Executives should not be forced into a single food Executive *&apos;*(i) Metals and Ores are ? it is understood, about to becovered by a Ministry of Munitions organisation in Paris.7$ Other minor items w&amp;ioh do not involve important transport considerations might be left alone for the present and possibly taken up later**In forming the above Ooramittees the various Departments would keep in touch with the organisation of the Transport Council with a view to securing uniformity in procedure as far as possible.&apos;8*     The Conference reoommn^ that His &amp;ajeBty*s -Sovomment, should now inform the^various&quot; Allied Governments that they approve of the establishment of Programme Committees and invite them to nominate representatives to serve on those Committees in conjunction with representatives of the above British Departments who have already been instructed to collect pre-liminary information, and with whom expert delegates of the &apos; Allied Governments are In most cases already in olose- touch,5*     If this plan be adopted, efficient bodies would have been established to examine the- needs of the Allies in respect of all these different commodities and to compare them with the supplies available.    Both the Transport and the War Purchases Councils will have a common ground upon which to work, and should have comparatively little difficulty in allocating the available tonnage and finance upon this common basis*     Thsre remains the question whether British representation on the two Inter-Ally Councils ought not to be more closely linked through the appointment of one of the principal British delegates to&quot;both parties,    Neit&amp;er Lord Robert Cecil nor I
can &quot;apare the time no cessary for this purpose. &quot;but I feet that tha British rerprereentation would bo gra&amp;uly s^trsngthsnad if such a link: wors created,     I have been unable to consult Lord Buckmasber as he is taking a shoirfe holiday, but if he were prepared . tj accept nomination, to the Maritime Council in addition bo his placo ou tho War Purchases Council, I think it would bo a  jreat advantage *    I should like to be authorised to sound him as to his willingness to undertake this double responsibility.(Initialled)  A* 0.
