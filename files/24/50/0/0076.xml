his britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.This document is the Property of3 S C H E T,get,-4476.WARoaeibsf.the proportional rsehbsssi&amp;tiom SCHEME.flote by Lord Cur2on. he Commissioners appointed under Section 20 of the Representation of the People Act to-prepare a scheme of Proportional Representation for the return of approximately 100 Members to the House of Commons - have reported, and their Report has been laid before ParliamentIn the House of Commons yesterday the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed that the diseussion upon it should take place in the House of Commons on Monday next, May 13.Inasmuch as this scheme was the result of a compromise, by which the House of Lords were persuaded to pass into law the Franchise Bill, it is desirable that the conditions under whioh the compromise was effected should be scrupulously observed. They were stated, in the House of Commons by the Home Secretary, in the House of Lords by myself.     I had the more-difficult task and was subjected to the greater pressure, because the majority of the House of Lords, which had pronounced by large majorities in favour of Proportional Representation, held the fate of the Bill in their hands.There was no substantial difference between our respective statements, which were made without possibility of inter-communication, in the two Houses of Parliament on the same afternoon.     But there were slight differences of form.The Home Secretary said (February 6, 1918:   Hansard p. 2251).1* &quot;The Commissioners are to frame the Scheme, but ithas no effect until this House, as well as the other House, has considered and adopted the scheme;   so that the hands of the Members of this House will not be tied by this Section, but they will be at liberty to con-sider the scheme, both in prinoiplo and in detail before it can have the force of law&quot;.2.(Ibid p.  252)&quot;The proposal is that if this House agrees to the Clause, the Commission shall be appointed and shall report, that when the Government will give this House an opportunity of expressing its free opinion upon the general question of the adoption of the Report;    if the opinion of the House, so freely ascertained, should be generally in favour of its adoption then the Government will put the Resolution for adoption in the hands of a Minister of the Crown, who will deal with it upon the same lines as we have dealt with the Report of the Speakers1 Conference - i,e. the Minister whoever he is will not be bound to insist on the use of the powers of the Government in the passage of every detail of the Report, but he will have the discretion which has been so freely exercised on this Bill, and in that sense the question will be left to the free decision of the house ....    if the House rejected the Report that would be the end of the whole matter&quot;.
lb Id p4 2253.&apos;11 do far as we are concerned we intend that this shall he a bona fide experiment tried in good faith.     But it re-mains true that the House m a whole will be masters of the position, and that,   vhen the time comes for consideration*of the Report of this Commission, they will be able to take what-ever course appears to them to be best in the interests of the Country&quot;vIn the House of Lords on the same day (Hansard p.406) I said(1)     &quot;It would not be possible for the Government to pledge themselves to accept in advance a scheme drawn up by Commissioners who have not yet been appointed and of the nature of which scheme they cannot therefore possi-. bly at this stage have any idea&quot;.(2)     &quot;The Government will submit the Report to the House of Commons as a whole,     The House of Commons must have the right to determine whether the Report as a whole shall or shall not be adopted as the basis of. discussion0........... and if the House of Commons thought itright and proper to express their assent to the scheme as a whole,  I think we might fairly assume that it -was a good and reasonable scheme, which it was generally desired should pursue its further stages towards the Statute Book.     In that case the Government would under-take to put a Minister in charge of the measure and he would use his best offices to secure the passage of&apos; a good and reasonable measure into law&quot;.Ibid (p. 419).(3.5   &quot;Clearly the Government is anxious for an experimentand proportional representation in suitable areas,subject to the consent of Parliament, otherwise Ishould not have made the suggestion the other evening,or been willing to support Lord Lansdowne *s amendment, this afternoon. lb id (p,421j,(4)   &quot;Lord Selborne xs question was this.      Supposing theCommissioners gave a Report and supposing the Govern-ment, after due consideration of the Report, feel that they are favourably disposed towards it, will they . as a Government do their best to support it in the House of Commons ?     Yes my Lords I see no difficulty whatever in giving such an assurance.     V/hether they would be successful or not of course I cannot say.     The House of Commons must be the Judge,,    Hut naturally as a Government if we agree with a thing, we do our best to support it&quot;.It seems to me that we are committed by the above passages from the speeches of the Home Secretary and myself(1)     to a consideration of the Commissioner^Report before it is discussed in the House of Commons, and adecision
decision as to &quot;whether we are disposed, subject to the approval of the House, to support it.(E) In the event of the Joint approval of the Government and the House of Commons to the introduction of a Bill to carry it into effect,  such Bill to &quot;be placed in charge of a Minister.In view of these circumstances I ask that the matter may he taken in Cabinet on the morning of Friday, IJay 10th,     As the Government is in all probability divided in opinion, it will perhaps be considered desirable that the sense of the House should be takon on Monday, without Ministers taking a strong line on either side in debate on the subject.(Initialled), 0, of K
