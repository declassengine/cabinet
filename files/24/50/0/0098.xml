SECRET. &apos;   NAVAL POLICY IN RUSSIA.Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.The future Russian policy of the Government- will affect the Naval situation in four different places (1)        The Black Sea (3)        The Baltic. (3)        Murmansk and Archangel. (4)        Vladivostock.(1)   The Black Sea.with respect to the Russian Black Sea Fleet., it is understood that the policy hitherto has been to endeavour to get the Bolshevik Government to utilise this force to maintain command of the Black Sea and, failing that, to get them to. destroy it.This policy seems for one reason or another to have failed, and, although the situation is complicated, there seems little doubt but that this naval force, or the greater part of it, will fall into the hands of the enemy, if it has not done&quot;so already0The Allied Naval Council are endeavouring to take steps to meet this menace.    Certain negotiations are going on for the necessary change in the disposition of the allied naval fences in the Mediterr-anean, and it is hoped that these will be successfully accomplished. If so, the allies should be in a position-to successfully deal with this new addition to the enemy1s fleet.(2)   The Baltic.The position here is different.   The policy has been always to urge the Bolshevik Government to destroy this force, because it is realised that it can never face the enemy and can, therefore, be of no use to the allied cause.    In-conjunction with this, the Naval Attache at Petrograd has put forward a definite proposal for the destruction of the greater part of this force - all the important ships of which have now reached Kronstadt *- at a cost of some  300,000. A paper on this subject has already been lodged with Sir Maurice Hankey and the decision of the Cabinet Is awaited.The Admiralty realise that the destruction of this force may raise somewhat complicated questions, but from the purely naval point of view the destruction of these ships would be cheap at the cost, and, since only-15$ of the money is to be paid as a first instalment ( 45,000) and the remaining 85^ only on the completion of the work, the-course proposed is strongly advocated.(3)  Murmansk and Archangel,The situation here is much more complicated.  We have at present Rear Admiral Kemp in charge of the naval forces, consisting of H.M. Ships GLORY, C0CHRANE, the Ice-Breaker ALEXANDER, and the French Cruiser AMIRAL AUBE.    These ships will shortly be reinforced by the USS.Cruiser 0LYMPIA and the small British Cruiser ATTENTIVE. Admiral Kemp has so far been extraordinary successful In dealing with the very complicated question.    He appears to be on the best of terms with the local Soviets.    He has some 200 to 300 men now on shcre^ and the presence, of this force has so far been.sufficient to check any advance on the part of the Germans during the Winter months.
j *There have been rumours of the assembly of Finnish White Guards close to the Norwegian frontier, and theso troops have also appearod on tho Murman Railway, although they do not appear to have inflicted any damage.It is considered that the Marraan railway will very shortly fbreak down owing to the thaw, and that the wooden bridge ever the I River at Kola will be swept away, as it has been daring the past two Springs.   Under any circumstances, the bridge and the railway can be destroyed by the sappers now on the spot.   The approach, except by railway, of any appreciable German forces after the thaw sets in will be extremely difficult, and it is considered that if Admiral Kemp is reinforced with some 600 men well supplied with machine guns the risk of the port being seized is not&quot;great.   It is needless to point out that a larger force of some 5,000 men as originally recommended -would be of considerably greater value, but this question has already been discussed and found impracticable by the War Office.It is considered, however, that this smaller force of 600 men could be usefully employed to support the Rod Guards against the White Guards, or even possibly to meet a Finnish attack on Murmansk-, but the successful issue of such a polios?&quot; would require the co-I operation of the allies and the consent of the Soviet Government.A number of Tzeeh troops is now arriving at Murmansk and Archangel, and Mr Leckhart has reported the intention of the Soviet Government to withdraw some of the defeated Red Guards from &apos; . : ty Finland to Murmansk.Under any circumstances, an additional supply of arms for the equipment of any forces which may be available would be desirable, and the question of to whom these arms should be distributed should be left at the discretion of the Admiral.     The latest news from Mr, Lockhart, however, is that the Germans are demanding the withdrawal of British forces at Murmansk.Archangel is not threatened at present in a military sense, but the presence of the large accumulation of allied stores there, together with the foodstuffs consigned to Mr Young to be exchanged for the stores, render some display of force cesirable.(4) Vladivostock.At Vladivostock the orders originally given to the Captain of the SUFFOLK were that he should co-operate with the Japanese and American Admirals in preventing the removal of the allied stores at that place.This question has 1b come somewhat complicated by the fact that the Bolshevik Government appear to contemplate removing stores which beleng to the Russian Government to the Westward.    Tho Japanese authorities arenapparently averse to talcing any steps to prevent this in order to avoid compromLsL ng the negotiations now being carried on with M. Trotski at Moscow with regard to allied intervention in Russia and Siberia.   This puts the Captain of the SUFFOLK in a somewhat equivocal position,&quot; since to prevent the removal of these stores -a step which he considers most necessary - he would not ^ be acting in close harmony with the Japanese authorities.   He is entitled to definite orders as to what his line is to be.(Sgd)   R, B, YflSMYSS.C N. S.FORWARDED: -(Sgd)    SRIC GEDI3SS.10.5.18.
