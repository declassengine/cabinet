THIS DOCUMENT IS&apos; THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT ami C MKJSSTY&apos;S GOyTSmkuSNT)S E 0 R E -T.G.T.-4452.WAR    C A   i N IB. T.SITUATION   IN - IRELAND,Memorandum by Chief Secretary for Ireland.It has been brought to my notice&apos;,-that a number *f Sinn Fein prisoners who are in prison in default of giving bail for their good behaviour,  and who until recently have refused to give bail are now commencing to do so.     The Governor of Belfast Prison reports as follows:-&quot;In a number of cases prisoners&apos; friends have advised the entering into required bail.   From letters passing out through my hands it would appear the majority of prisoners are willing to enter into bail but will not do so until the head of their political organization tells them to do so&quot;.and in a further communication,  dated the 1st instant, he states that&quot;A letter from Austin Stack passed through my hands to-day to prisoner J. kacDonagh to the effect that the Kerry prisoners were to enter into required bail and obtain their release at once&quot;.The Governor of Londonderry prison reports in regardto a bail case in his custody -&quot;A letter received from friends of this prisoner says that arrangements to get him out on bail are being made *by direction of the Irish Republican authorities1&quot;.It is not clear what the motive underlying this changeof policy on the part of the Sinn Fein leaders may be, butthe change is worthy of note, and I have given directionsthat careful record is to be kept of the persons who comeforward as sureties for the prisoners in question.
Tho following extracts from the Report of the Inspector-General, Royal Irish Constabulary, on the state of public fooling in Ireland for the week ended 27th April, 1918, may bo of interest.&quot;During the past week public feeling in the Provinces continued in a restless and excited oondition entirely due to tho hatred of conscription. The oxtremo tension of the preceding week when the military Service i*o% was extended to Ireland was not, however, quite so noticeable,        feeling prevails in many localities that in view of the hostility already shown the Government will scarcely persist in its proposals and that the first imminent danger is past&quot;,&quot;Conscription alone, is howovor, the one question, and tho campaign against it shows no abatement&quot;,&quot;In the Y/ost and South-Aest resistance to the Act, if enforced,  is likely to be violent and to lead to a general outbreak&quot;.&quot;Efforts are undoubtedly being made to undermine the loyalty of the police and they are regarded everywhere with hostility as the most obvious weapon with which to enforce conscription ,     They are being warned and attacked by the Clergy, and are undoubtedly in a most difficult and trying position.     In some places they are partially boycotted&quot;.&quot;The situation over all the Provinces is one of extreme gravity&quot;.Tho following information has been received by theInspector-General of Constabulary from a reliable source&quot;Ho matter what Home Rule Bill is passed except it is one which gives full fiscal autonomy, tho Sinn Fein Party will not recognise it.     Ho matter how Conscription is enforced thoy will resist it.Sinn IPeiners arc led to believe that a revolution will bring the case of Ireland before the Peaco Conference, and that if one takes place a number of Gorman officers and men with machine guns will be landed at different points on the coast from submarines.They
They are urged to continue drilling -aid with little display.     They are warned not to commit any act which might bring them into conflict with the Military, but to be prepared for any overt act on their part.At the Maynooth Conference (18th April) De Yalera insisted that he would resist conscription by armed force and that in his conscience it was consonant with the law of   Cod,     Dr. Fogarty and other Bishops supported this theory.     It was carried almost unani-mously.     Cardinal Logue dissented.In conjunction with some of the Bishops the Sinn Fein party are endeavouring to make the Irish party abstain from attending Parliament and to establish a Provisional Government in Dublin,     It I&apos;&apos;: said this will be done if conscription is enforced.The first move to ho made, in the event of conscription, by the workers is the dismantling of all gas and electric power stations in cities and towns, and the burning of stores supplying food and forage to tho Army.     This is to be done as soon as they down tools.&quot;(Sgd. ) SHORTTMay .6th, 1918.
