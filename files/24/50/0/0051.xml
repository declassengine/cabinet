Political Intelligence Department,FOREIGN OFFICE.May 3rd, 1918-Sweden /OOE.MEMORANDUM ONPUBLIC OPINION IN SVffiDEN.The position of the Liberal Socialist Government in Sweden appears at the present moment to be precarious and, according to statements of certain of its members, there is a danger of a Con-servative Government coming into power unless the economic ne-gotiations with the Allied Governments are brought to a satis-factory oonclusion within a short time.     The fail of the present Government, if it comes, will then be due primarily to the short-age of food stuffs in the oountry and the consequent privations and irksome restrictions to which the population already are be-ing subjeoted, and which will necessarily increase up te the September harvest unless supplies from outside can be prooured.A contributory cause $f dissatisfaction is probably the handling by the Government of the Finnish situation.     Tho aver-ago Swede has two well-marked characteristics - pride of race and a strong sense of law and order.     Both these have suffered during these last months in connection with the Finnish and Aland questions, for the Germans have secured the predominant position in Finland which the Swedes have always felt should have been theirs by right and the opportunity has net been takenti tiadvantage of to strike a Swedish blow at the Finnish Reds, re-presentatives of the detested Bolshevism.As regards the first of these points, ths Conservatives clamoured for Swedish military intervention in answer to tho ap-peal from the White Government in Finland.     They now insist that, had it taken place, Sweden w.mld be occupying in Finland the position since secured by Germany.     Peoplo in Sweden know
full well that this would not have he en the result of inter-vention.     Werner Ryden, Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs, has publicly stated that the Finnish Government had applied to Ger-many for intervention before turning to Sweden and, as the of-ficial Finnish rejoinder does not contain a direct denial of his statement, it may he accepted as true.     It is clear then that, had intervention taken place, Sweden could only have played a secondary rolo in Finland and would have run grave risk of being arawn into the War on the German side.None the less, though it is easy to show that the Conserva-tive diagnosis of the situation was false and that of the Govern-ment correct, the fact remains that the idea of intervention made a certain appeal to the man in the street for the reasons above stated.     He does not deny that the Government has done fairly well in very difficult circumstances, yet at the bottom of his heart he is neither happy nor satisfied.One must never forget that Sweden still lives to some ex-tent in the great days of the past, - the days of Charles XII and Gustavus Adolphus.     Sweden ought again to play a great role, if not in the world at large, then at least in northern Europe, - so thinks the Swede.In those early days of the War when Eammarskjoia lectured on the sovereign rights of Sweden and showed a sensitiveness with regard to them which was looked upon in this oountry as irritat-ing and fatuous, he yet made a strong appeal to the Swedes as individuals for the result of the position which he took up was that Sweden stood out from the rest of the European neutrals. So now, conversely, despite the able handling by the Government tf the Finnish and Aland problems, Sweden^ rulers have to suf-fer because she has, through ciroumstanoes, been to some ex-tent humiliated.       Except in Conservative and Bolshevist circles, no direct blame has been attributed to the Govern-/ment
ment, yet there exists a general feeling of dissatisfaction. Sweden&apos;s prestige has suffered.One would have expected in these circumstances that public opinion would have turned very strongly against the nation owing to whose action Sweden really owes this loss of prestige, namely, Ger-many.     This has undoubtedly been the case to some - extent, but here comes in the second point in tho Conservative appeal to a Swedish oharacteristio - the lcve of that law and order which is in grave peril, it is believed, from the Bolshevik movement.There is na l$ve lost between Finn and Swede, yet undoubtedly the Conservative demand for intervention in Finland on the side of the&quot;Whites&quot; was considerably strengthened because of the ardent de-sire *f almost every Swede to deal a blow at the &quot;Reds&quot;.     Bol-shevism, in fact, is held to be a greater danger than Germany. In an interesting telegram, the &quot;Times&quot; correspondent has pointed out that pro-Entente Swedes have adtually been heard to blame the English and French Governments for not having invited Sweden to intervene against &quot;the Common enemy of civilisation&quot;, and so, in-stead of the full tide of Swedish discontent being turned against the real enemy, Germany, the Swedish Government has had to take its share of it and the Bolshevist peril serves to divert a con-siderable part of the rest.     The Swedes, concerned and annoyed though they are at the German domination of Finland, are yet more irritated by the spread of Bolshevism which, nota bene, the Germans in Finland are successfully aiding in suppressing.With regard to public opinion and the world war, competentabservers declare that the pendulum is steadily swinging in ourfavour.     70 or 80$ of the population are declared to be pro-Ally.It is without doubt true that if a referendum on the subject weretaken, the clear majority would vote pro-Ally and the entry of theUnited States, with its large Swedish colonies furnishing recruitsfor the new American Armies, helps to swell the flowing tide./yet
Y^t the.t)TO--rEni^rrWelements in Sweden are on the whole strangely inartiouiate and the pro-Grerman-Kdnority is particularly noisy. The fact is that there is in Sweden an rntense---longing for peace and so long as peace comes, the ordinary man in the street whose feelings are, as a rule, very luke-warm, does not much care how it arrives. The German offensive may bring this peace and so it is watohed with curiously mixed feelings.     But, given the offensive fails and the soales of war are again evenly balanced, there is a strong likelihood that Sweden may then definitely come to be classed with the pro-entente neutrals,In the meantime, unless the economic negotiations with the U.S.A. and the Allies can be brought to a successful conclusion, we have to face the possibility of a Conservative Government oeming into power, - a Government which, while maintaining a. spsoious appearance of neutrality, will deliberately follow a pro-German policy.
