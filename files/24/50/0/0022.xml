The Director General.FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1)1st May, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 30th April, 1918:The Weather.The weather last week was, on the whole, favourable to farming, the land drying extremely quickly after the heavy rains recently experienced.    The low temperature at night has, however, cheeked the growth of grass, and in some cases yellowed wheat.Severe frosts have caused considerable damage to both potatoes and damsons in the North.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Bxedutive Committees. Bedfordshire * The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a neglected farm of 200 acres which forms part of Pirton Hall Gletoe.    The tenant, who is an old man, is willing that the Committee shall take possession provided that he is allowed to remain in the dwelling house, and this has been arranged.   22 acres have been sown with cereals for 1918, and out of the 160 acres of grass on the farm 100 acres will be broken up this summer for the 1919 harvest.Essex - The occupier of a farm of 133 acres near Saffron Walden purchased the farm in 1912 leaving the bulk of the purchase money on mortgage.     Owing to laok of capital and knowledge he is
unable adequately to cultivate the farm, whioh requires redraining and is covered with twitch and docks.     The Committee have been authorised to take possession and to cultivate the farm. ^Lancashire - The Committee have taken possession of a farm of 75 acres near Widnes, of which the owner occupier is deeply involved in debt, a bailiff being in possession.    The land had been ploughed and prepared but the owner had no money to tray seed, only one horse fit to work, and no labour.    The Committee will plant the land with cereals and roots for the 1918 crop. Surrey - 69 acres of land near Walton Downs used as a gallop by the Epsom Grand Stand Association are now being sown with oats, the Executive Committee having taken possession and let the land to a tenant.Drainage of Land * In Cambridgeshire the Committee have cleansed and scoured about 100 chains of the River Mel and 55 chains of main drains in the Isleham Fen.    They have also taken in hand the clearance of channels in the East Pen and the clsansing of the rivers which Join forming the Cam above Cambridge,     They have induced the South Level Commissioners to undertake the cleansing of a length of the Ten Mile River immediately above Denver Sluice, and&apos; the removal of shoals in the Old West River. Prosecutions - A farmer of South Molton, Devon, has been fined  30 and  20 costs for non-compliance with an order to plough 34 acres and sow the land with corn or potatoes.     In Monmouthshire a land-owner at Grosmont has been fined  40 for failure to plough up 20 acres of grass land, and in Carmarthenshire a farmer at Llanddausant has been fined  50 for failure to plough 10 acres of land.Determination of Tenancies - During the week 6 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respeot of 48 acres.
HORTICULTURAL, DIVISION. Horticultural Organisation - Reports stating that arrangements are being made to form Horticultural Sub-Committees have been received from 7 Agricultural Executive Committees during the week.     The present position with regard to the constitution of Horticultural Sub-Committees is that Sub-Committees have been, or are being, formed in every County with the exception of the Isle of Ely and Westmorland in England, and Carmarthen, Glamorgan, and Radnor in Wales.Provision of Land for Allotments - Reports received from 1,154 dis-tricts show that 296,710 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (to. 2), and that 269,371 plots containing 19,535 acres have been provided.During the week 4 local Authorities have taken steps t* acquire, in addition to the area mentioned above, 13 acres (159 allotments) including 5 additional acres in Wandsworth.There are now 32 acres of allotments at Kenilworth. which shows that a quarter of the 1,600 householders of this district is cultivating a plot.     In addition it is also stated that every house is provided with a garden whioh Is being cultivated. Y.M.C.A- Allotments - During the week an additional 5&amp; acres have been brought under cultivation.Munition Works&apos; Allotments - 20 acres at Hayes (Middlesex) are now under cultivation with vegetable crops.     An area of 6 acres at Swindon has been inspected and the cultivators have been advised as to cropping and general cultivation.Area under Potatoes - The full results of the efforts recently made to secure an Increase in the potato acreage among small holders are not yet known, but. the following increases have already been notified;-
Hertford (Bishops Stortford)     ...Berkshire (Newbury) .....,Warwickshire, (Stratford-on-Avon and94 acres 55     HCoventry)173 200 1174 * *West Riding (Selby)* * *Total -   639 acresIn Hertfordshire it is reported that up to the 24th April, 1,000 more acres have been planted with potatoes than in 1917.Fruit Section - The total number of orders for glass jars received from retailers by the Glassware Supply Department of the Ministry of Munitions now amounts to 5,593,284.Market Empties - The improvement noted last week with regard to the conveyance of empty baskets by rail has been maintained, one of the largest firms reporting that about 12,000 of their empties were removed last week, and that they are now clear of all arrears. Satisfactory reports have also been received from Hull and Newcastle-on-Tyne.Activated Sludge.     Investigations into the value of this material, which is prepared by a process invented by Dr. Fowler of Manchester, have been aided by grants from the Board for several years, but very little definite information as to Its agricultural value is, as yet, available.    The process has now been adopted by several towns, including St. Albans, and analyses indicate that activated sludge might prove &quot;a most valuable fertiliser in 1919 and subsequently, when there Is likely to be a shortage of artificial manures.    The Departments Technical Committee are of opinion that the Rothamllfed Experimental Station should give special attention to activatedDuring the week 65 demonstrations in fruit bottling, drying and canning have been given.TECHNICAL DIVISION.- 4 m
sludge. If arrangements can be made to begin experiments there. Seed Pressings.   Farmers have, long-been in the nabit of using dressings containing coal tar or wood tar for treating seeds to keep birds off.    The wood tar formerly used is no longer available, and the activities of the Ministry of UunlUons have altered the character of the coal tar, at least in some districts.    Reoent trials of seed dressings made from the- coal tap now available and compounded according to old formulae have been found to destroy seeds.    A number of new tar produota resulting from wood distillation are now being made, and experiments are being instituted with the object of discovering suitable materials for dressing seeds before next autumnLABOUR DIVISION.Recruitings    With regard to the withdrawal of exemptions held by agricultural workers, representations are being made to the Department that the time allowed for the making of appeals, (that is, before the 16th May) iB too short for the cases to be properly and fully oonsidered*    The Department have made representations to the Ministry of National Service with regard to the calling up, under the order of the 9th April, of repairers of agricultural implements, steam ploughs, threshing machines etc, and drivers and mechanics employed thereon, and that Ministry have instructed their regional Officers that this order does not intend to de-certify such men, and that Any calling up notioes to men so employed should be cancelled. The question of affording further protection to blacksmiths, wheelwrights, lime burners, expert drainers, etc. is being taken up with the Ministry.Information is being obtained from Agricultural Executive Committees as to the cases of any of their officers whose servioes are considered to be essential and who are affected by the new Order with a view to the Ministry of National Service being approached to allow the retention of such men.- 6 -
Soldier Labour.     The total number of soldiers attached to depots to date by the Military Authorities for the 1918 Agricultural       &amp; Programme is now 42.503 (32,388 skilled and 10,115 unskilled).   Of this number 40,036 (31,259 skilled and 8,777 unskilled) are out on farms, including 413 men sent out during the week.     The Military Authorities have informed the Department that soldiers with agricultural experience who can be made available from time to time for farm work will continue to be posted to Agricultural Companies.The total number of soldiers sent out for training as traotor drivers is now 3,959, an additional 26 men having been supplied during the week.Horses.

146 additional schemes are now with the War Office for theestablishment of prisoners of war camps in various parts of the country.     These schemes provide for the employment of 7,509 prisoners over and above those already mentioned on farm work.WOMENfS BRANCH.Recruiting *   The weather has again been unfavourable for openair meetings, but.in spite of this meetings have been held inLondon and suburbs every morning., afternoon -and evening during theweek.    Successful speeches have been made also from the stages oftheatres and muslo halls.The following are the results of some of the recruitingefforts in the Provinces:-The number of women enrolled through the War Services Exhibition at Hull ................ 565at Bradford................. 144at Doncaster ................   24The War Services Exhibition has alse been to Cardiff during theweek, and for the first two or three days 150 women were enrolled.Sbme results of recent rallies are:*-Nottingham ........ 200 recruitsBishop Auckland ... 100      &quot;Leicester......... 130      &quot;Birmingham ........ 100      nA rally has also been held at Oxford which was specially interest-ing In view of the fact that Her Royal Highness Princess Mary dis-tributed not only stripes and armlets to members of the Land Army,but also to local women workers who had come Into Oxford from over300 villages.Employment.   The demand for women labour has not greatly increased owing to the inolemency of the weather, but the requests for highly skilled women continue to come in large numbers.The Croup Leaders are now engaged in organising gangs of local women for seasonal work.    Five gangs have already been applied for in Hertfordshire.     The Group Leader in Cambridge has
visited various villages where it was believed additional labour would be required, and has found in many cases that the local wo: were prepared to come out in sufficient numbers to make imported-ilabour unnecessary.     Much enterprise on the part of the women i reported from Cornwall, where the Group Leader states that she saw a District Representative moving a family to another parish where they could be more fully employed.Training.   During the past week the opening of 31 fresh Training Centres and, Practice Farms and several bursary trainings giving fresh accommodation for 172 women have been sanctioned.8,102 women are accounted for In the Land Army asfollows:-In Instruction Centres ..........       847On Farm Work....................    6,447Employed by the Forage Committee.        255 Employed by Timber Department .,,        143 Waiting for references to be placed in Training Centres .....        235Waiting in Depots............... 34Waiting in their own homes......        141Total 8,IQgWomen/s Institutes.

Fertilisers.    The Fertiliser Prices Order, 1918, has now beenissued by the Ministry of Munitions, and a Joint Committee of thei &apos;three Agricultural Departments has been set up to deal w^th questions of distribution.Lime.   The question of the labour supply for Lime Works is very acute at the present time, owing to the number of. skilled workmen who are liable to be called up for military serviee under the new Regulations.    An appeal has been made to the National Serviee Department for special consideration for these men, who are indispensable to food production.Seed Potato Supply. Deliveries of the Department^ seed potatoes are now nearly complete.
Contracts for seed placed by the Department with growersf) .amounted to about 26,000 tons (Scottish, Irish and English) by the beginning of January, which amount was subsequently raised to over 32,000 tons by purchases for the Army.Orders began to fcome in about the 10th January, at which time a period of severe frost prevented the movement of fseed?j and loading only became possible about the 25th January.    Prom then on the rate of delivery steadily increased up to 21st March, when it approached 400 tons a day.Including deliveries to the Army, written advices have been received of the delivery of 26,000 tons, but this figure is certainly below that of the actual deliveries!A number of complaints have been received as to delay in the delivery of seed potatoes.    In some cases they are well founded but the delay caused was due to a series of circumstances over which the Department had no control.    Among the conditions whioh made rapid delivery difficult were the following:1.     Shortage of labour on the farms from which seed was purchased.2.    Difficulty in securing wagons and sheets, and delay in. moving loaded wagons.3.    The necessity of replacing orders in casee where contractors advised the Department late in the season that they were unable to execute the total orders received because the outrun of their pits was less than the quantity which they had agreed to supply.4.    Inevitable delay in securing fresh supplies to meet these requirements and in forwarding bags to the new contractors.5.    The check in delivery at the end of March consequent upon the extra military pressure on the railways during the latter hlllf of March when the seed potato traffic was at its heaviest.
Director*General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E, Prothero, M.P.President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.Complaints as to quality of Used1 have been confined chiefly to varieties immune to Wart Disease, which were permitted to be sold under the Order &quot;as grown provided that all large potatoes and all such potatoes as would pass through a riddle having a li&quot; mesh were removed&quot;.    This provision was necessary owing to the short supplies available, but It was undoubtedly abused and very large potatoes were Included as fseed*.Potato Spraying.    Much personal work is now being done among allotment holders in the open.    The planning of trial plots, preparation of soil and planting are going on apace, the stage reached depending on the districts, variety of seed, etc.Committees, societies, etc, which had previously declined lectures are now asking for them to be provided. Wart Disease.   It appears that, in certain parts of Glamorgan, the whole of which county is Included within the district restricted to the planting of immune varieties, the impression prevails that any variety of seed potatoes may be planted if a grower has saved his Ueed1 from last yearfs crop.    A press notice is being Issued pointing out that it is not permlssable to plant any maincrop variety susceptible to wart disease.Buckwheat for Sowing.    Arrangements are being made for 100 tons of buckwheat to be Imported from France and sold to a number of selected dealers in this country for re-sale specifically for sowing as a poultry food crop.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,
