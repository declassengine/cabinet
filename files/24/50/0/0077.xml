(This document is the Property of his Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).KSCKBT.IMMOBILISATION. Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Reconstruction.1.       The proposals of Sir Auckland Geddes in his Memorandum on the Control of L: abour Supply (Q.T. 3984) closely concern the Ministry of Reconstruction.It is-proposed(a)   That the Ministry of National Service shouldbe given the control of the Employment Exchanges, with which must necessarily go the whole machine^ of Unemployment Insurance;   and(b)   That the Ministry of National Service^ have considerable responsibilities i;should inconnection with Demobilisation.2.       With regard to (a), I de not propose to discuss the technical issues raised&apos; in the Memorandum of the Kiniste; of National Service and Minister of Labour.    But it must be remembered that to the average workman the National S ervice D epartment is the Conscription Department, and if the Employment Exchanges were handed over to it, there would in all probability be an outcry arising from a fear of industrial conscription.3.       The important.questions connected with demobilisation, however, need-special comment.     The change suggested would mean the transfer of Unemployment Insurance at the time when it has become necessary to press forward a large scheme for the extension of Unemployment Insurance in connection with our Demobilisation proposals.It is extremely doubtful whether the Ministry of National
Service, who are not concerned with Unemployment Insurance, are a suitable body to undertake the responsibilities connected with this work.

4. With regard to (b), the proposal in the Memorandum to vest in the Ministry of National Service "considerable responsibilities in connection with Demobilisation" also affects Reconstruction very closely. The Memorandum is based upon an assumption which I cannot accept. It is said that "as mobilisation of the man power resources of the Country for war is the function of the Man Power Ministry, so it not unnaturally follows that that Department should be responsible for demobilisation". During the War the "Man Power Ministry" has bean governed largely, though not entire by military considerations. The principle which lies behind the Reports of the Army Demobilisation Committee is that Mobilisation is essentially a military problem, whilst the order of Demobilisation is essentially governed by social and industrial needs. Mobilisation and Demobilisation are quite distinct in their purpose, methods and machinery, and therefore it by no means follows that those responsible for mobilising man power for one purpose should be responsible for demobilising it for another.

The period of transition will merge imperceptibly into the period of settled peace and the re-transfer of the Employment Department machinery back to the Ministry of Labour (if it were now transferred to the Ministry of National Service) would mean dislocation at a time when the administration of the country should be moving as smoothly as possible.

It is also highly probable that an attempt to establish the National Service Department as the organisation for carrying out these important functions in the transition period would be associated in the minds of Labour with some scheme for Industrial
Conscription after the war.5.       a iS I think important that in considering the proposed transfer of the Employment Department to the- Ministry of National S orvicc, the Cabinet should hare before- them some of the Demobilisation problems with which the machinery of the Employment Department will have to deal.6.       The problems with which the Government is-faced may be considered under: tho main heads&apos;. -(l)   Military Demobilisation(IX) ^ivilDembMliBation&quot;.(l)   M the end of the war the demobilized men will have to be brought homo to tho dispersal stations&apos; and then re-settled&apos; in industrial life.But their re-inst&amp;toment in oivil employment docs not end our responsibilities^    It in proposed&apos;that should they become unemployed during-the year following their discharge, thoy should be paid an unemployment donation for a period&quot; not exceeding twenty wwks:.     This- will throw additional work upon those responsible for the administration-of the Employment Exchange s%    At the same time, It implies an adequate machinery for bringing men into touch with employers requiring labour.Moreover, it will continue to be necessary to give full. attention to tho questions relating&quot;to the employment of partially disabled&quot; soldiers, particularly dtring the transition period, whilst demobilised apprentices will probably require special treatment.(ll)   The problem of &quot;Civil Demobilisation11 is- oven larger in its ocope and more complicated in character than military demobilisation.    The distribution of workers- in industry^during the war is totally different from what it was prior to the war. After the war a-new and rapid re-distribution will be necessary.
Seae trades have, of eeurea, shrunk to half of what they wure in %9ti 1014:   others have swollen to enormous dimensions.    -The re-dlstrihution of labour at the end of the war will be complicated- djr the fact that substitutes will be dispensed with when those who previously did their work have been discharged&quot; from the Aa?my or left their war work,    There Will certainly be quite ten million replacements to be dealt with.    During this time it will be neoessary to have regard to war pledges, industrial agreements, the course 6f trade and other similar cansideratiens. here will be many new features in the Industrial system after the war.    8chemea of industrial training will in all likeli-hood be needed&apos;to assist those who have been deprived&apos;of the value of their skill owing to war changes and these who are to engage in* *t*he expanding trade as    These scheme a of training must be inoperation during the period of demobilisation and in the closestpossible touch with the Employment Department.Demobilisation therefore involves:-.(l) The re-initatement in civil life of men with the forces.(2) Machinery for the payment of out-of-work donation.(3) Arrangements for the training and employment of partially disabled men.(4) Provision for the ccnmleticn of training of demobilised-&apos; apprentices.(6) The ^demobilisation&quot; of civil war werkera and their reinstatement in reasonable permanent employment.(6) l&amp;chinery for the temporary employment on suitable works of public utility of thoee employed in industries where unemployment has arisen.(7) Machinery for the payment of unemploymentinsurance (the administration of which will not be identical with that connected with out-of-work donation).(8) So&amp;emes of industrial training and re-training.
7.       Thesse functions normally arts the work &apos;of the&apos;Ministry of Labour.    It is cls&amp;r that this large programme cannot be carried out by a-Department whose main functions and interests are of a different kind and which cannot devote &quot;considerable attention to maturing the detailed schemes and preparing the requisite machinery beforehand.    The programme involves close&apos;co-operationa &quot; * - *with tits Ministry of Reconstruction;   and also with other Departments on a number of collateral industrial problems.8.       On the other haaad, it is essential to realise the strain which these things will put upon the Ministry of Labour,     So far from it being possible to risk the dislocation involved in&apos; the*v transfer of the Employment Department to the Ministry of National 8$rvioe, the Smployment Department will need considerable extensions: to its- exietingmachinery if .&apos;.it ;is to cope with the vast and complicated work which lies before it,     I have purpose-ly enlarged upon this aspect of the question because I desire to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the vital necessity of having adequate machinery for dealing with the Demobilisation problems to which X have referred.    I am gravely concerned whether we are taking adequate eteps to secure that th&amp;&apos;machinery of the Employment Department will be adequate to meet the strain.I have suggested&apos;1 to the Minister of Labour in connection with the proposals of the Second Report of the Civil *ar Workers Committee, that a email Committee of experts should examine the administrative details involved, so that we may see how far the existing machinery is capable of expanding adequately to meet the work involved.    The Minister of Labour has felt some doubt about accepting the suggestion, and therefore, as the Minister . responsible for co-ordinating the Demobilisation machinery, I feel
- * ^constrained to bring this matter to the notice, of the Cabinet, and to ask for their decision. *    .It is essential to make absolutely sure new that the machinery will be capable ef dealing kith the vae-t mast of work which will be thrown upon It On the cessation of hostilities.i     Hfy anxious th&amp;rofore that this particular matter should be examined by a* small- expert Cojomittee J uhder the Chairmanship of a Minister.C, MDI80K.7th May, 1916.
