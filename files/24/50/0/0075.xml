12.Tho Shipping Controller wishes to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the position as regards tho supply of coal available for oxport.The War Oabinet is aware that recently, owing to:-the amount of coal required for export to our Allies has large-ly increased.Moreover the United states of America have just agreed to co-ordinate with us shipments of coal to South America, this agreement being based on a definite restriction of U.u.A. imports from South America and a consequent material saving of tonnage for the Allied cause.   A steady shipment of large quantities of coal monthly is essential to this schemeQwith the coal situation so serious , there is the definite risk that the agreement may fall through and tho saving of tcn-nage be lost.The results of the present shortage of coal are:-The vital necessity of increasing the coal supply of Italy from an average of 4,50^000 tons to 500,000 tons per month.The replacement to Prance of such of the foregoing quantity as is supplied by franco to italyu(3)The replacement to Prance of the coal which cannot be railed from the Bruay Mines, South of the Somme, owing to the Germanoffensive.(a)   The Italian coal position has been mot, but Shipments of replacement coal to Prance areat present 66$ of tho proper quantity decidedon as the minimum amount to be sont and eventhis
this figure has been reached by chipping a quality of coal not really required by France, and giving i^ronch shipment preference over all shipments to Neutral Countries.(b) Shipments to South America have been 50  of the proper quantities;(c) Neutral ships have to wait for cargoes, in some cases as long as one month.    These delays represent definite loss to the Allies (I) be-caus^ the essential cargoes of iron ore and to a lesser degree of food stuffs, which these ships would carry, are not brought; and (2) the tonnage required to give theso neutrals the coal due to them under our agreements is in-creased to tlie nztent to which these ships are delayed, this means less tonnage for Allied purposes.  Moreover, there is the point that we have definitely undertaken to give the Northern Neutrals coal for tonnage received from them and failure to do so must have a prejudicial effect on B.k.Government*s relations with thornThe efxect of the coal shortage is seen, in as much as it has been necessarv to send away in ballast this week some 65,0C0 tons   -of shipping, which would have loaded coal had it been available.It appears therefore to the Shipping Controller essential to consider the offeet on the output of any further comb out of miners.   It is understood that it is proposed to take another 25,000 men after the first 50,000.   Assuming that this is an ec-sential measure it appears to the Shipping Controller to be edually essential, that these men should not bo taken from such mines, as are producing the steam coal required for export, and that a way be found to solve the difficulties, which are under-stood to exist in transferring men from the inferior mines to those producing steam coal.
In this connection,also, it appears.. J,o be a matter for urgent consideration, whether steps should not he taken at once to induce the miners to forego the Vhitsun Holidays.   It is understood, that in Scotland no holiday is usually taken, in Northumberland and Durham only one day, and in South Wales and elsewhere 3 days.It is estimated that in South hales the customary holiday will represent at least  500,000 tons shortage on the output.8th May. 1918,
