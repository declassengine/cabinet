FOCD   PRODUCTION   IN   1919..teStoMhtopUii-   BY   THE   POOD   CONTROLLERI have read with some anxiety the Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture on Pood Production in 1919 (G.T.4409) with the accompanying Memorandum by the Director General of Pood Production.   The Memoranda indicate that, in view of the new situation created by the transfer of a a^n*fc$3?sfe labour   to the Army, it will be impossible even to maintain, much less to Increase, the scale of pro-due tion which has been attained this year.1 am not in a position to judge of the ioet-eTPtr to vrtiich additional labour, machinery, fuel and oil are essential to the carrying out of the programme; but I would urge upon the Cabinet the vital importance of hot merely maintaining, but increasing home production, especially of ceroals.The Allies are now dependent for imported cereals practically on North America, the Argentine and India alone. Only by the most severe restriction and conservation in the United States, has it been possible this year to meet their need3.   Shortages of labour, of machinery and of fertilisers, and the loss of country to the enemy, have told mere heayily on our Allies than on ourselves and the needs of the Allies as a whole have increased and are likely to increase further. Failure of the harvest in any one of the exporting countries might very gravely jeopardise supplies.Not only from the standpoint of tonnage, but of national safety, it is urgently necessary to maintain home production at the highest possible level.     Assuming - as is only prudent -that the war will not end till 1920, it. would not, in my judg-mant, be wise to retain in the Army or Navy, still less in munition works, skilled agricultural labour essential to the maintenance of production^Ministry of Food. 10th May 1918,
