The very cold wind has seriously retarded spring corn crops anoTturned their colour.     The farm operations on the Colmiy during the week included the preparation and soaring of the land with mangolds, drilling clovers and rolling wheat.    Another settler, J. Joyce, has arrived on the Colony.     The crops and produce disposed ^f during the week included 42 qrs, oats, 6 cwt, potatoes, 98 day-old chicks and ducklings and 1,551 eggs.Heath Hill,     The remainder of the corn crops has been drilled, making the total acreage of barley now to be 118 acres,     A commencement has been made with mangold sowing, of which 38 acres are to be drilled. The dirty condition of the land due for roots has caused a lot of work to be put in before the sowing and planting could be carried out, but  he weather being favourable^- it is hoped to make a start with potato planting next week,Kejham Estate,     Since the last report the weathor has been cold, windy, without rain, but with a slight frost at night.     In some respects this haa been ideal for the work, cleaning operations going- on without a break.     Wire-^orm, however, has commenced on the oats after   - r,  urf,     A large acreage of the corn has been rolled:    spring corn i$ promising.    Mangolds, potatoes, clover seeds and lucerne have been put in;   also the sugar beet for seed production (15 acres).     Steam Cultivation has been resumed at Avcrham Park, and the weather will be the determining factor as to how much of the remaining acreage will be so,-m &quot;fith turnips and ho*^ much will be left fallow.     It is expected to lime 200 acres before the autumn.     This is greatly needed by the land both for swedes and future leguminous crops.    Hedges (168 chains) have been uprooted, burnt, and the roots grubbed at the cost of 4/8dc per chain.     The live stock acquired to date include 7 horses, 168 cattle, 46 sheep and 4 pigs.     Hay on the estate is very scarce, but the worst time i3 now over,Plax Production Branch,The weeding of the flax crop has now commenced.     In most districts this operation is being undertaken by the growers themselves or by labour obtained from local sources.     In a certain number of cases, however, it has been found necessary to establish camps of imported labour *     Favourable reports are received from all districts as regards the growth of the crop.Tithe, Commons, Copyhold and Survey Branch,During the past Troek one application for Merger, three for Redemption, and three for Altered Apportionment of tithe rentcharge have been received, ,,;rhile six mergers and one enfranchisement of copyhold have boon confirmed.     The Board have received from their Assistant Commissioner, Mr. T. Colquhoun Dill, a report of the enquiry recently hold by him upon the application by the lord of tho manor of Tolleshunt p&apos;&apos;Arcy, Essex, for the Boardvs consent under the Law of Commons Amendment Act, 1893, to tho inclosure or approvement of about 53 acres of Tiptroe Heath and Longheath Common, Essex.     In considering applications of this character the Board are bound to satisfy themselves that inclosure Mil be of benefit to the
neighbourhood, as well as to private interests, and to those who are legally interested in the cemmono     The expression &quot;&quot;benefit of the neighbourhood&quot; Includes the health, comfort, and convenience of the inhabitants of any cities, towns, villages or populous places in or near any parish in which the common or any part thereof is situated Mr. Dill18 Report is still under consideration by the Board^i^t, Cpmmj.tte,e. of the Board of Agriculture- and FisheriesAt the recent Meeting convened by the Tunbridge Wells Farmers1 Club at the instance of the Joint Committee, it was reported that considerable dissatisfaction was being expressed in the County by agricultural labourers and others at the inability to secure cheese.     It was suggested that some attempt should be made to produce locally.    With this object, a lecture was arranged at Tunbridge Wells and was given on the 30th April by Mr. Blackshaw, Superintending Inspector of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Cheese classes are also being arranged for.     Arising from a Meeting at Barnet (Herts) arranged by the Joint Committee, it was stated that the Dairy Farmers in the district suffered considerable loss owing to abortion in their herds.    A lecture by Sir Stewart Stockman, Chief Veterinary Officer to the Board of Agriculture, on &quot;Abortion in Cattle&quot;, has been arranged by the South Herts and North Middlesex Farmers1 Association for Wbdnesday the 8th instant.The Joint Committee!s letter to the Nonconformist Ministers of England and Wales asking them to make an appeal to their congregations to respond to the Prime Minister1s call for a considerable increase in the cultivation of potatoes, has been most satisfactory.Meetings to explain Government Orders etc., have been held during the week at:-    Havant, Frome and Brockenhurst.Pig Production Section.A large amount of correspondence has been dealt with, and a number of callers have been seen.    The Director attended a large meeting at Ipswich on 30th ult., convened by the East Suffolk Chamber of Agriculture, and spoke on pig production.    A letter has been addressed to Gil Chairmen of Parish Councils asking them to call a meeting with a view to promoting pig production whei^e action in that direotion has not already been taken.    A conference was held at the Ministry of Food on the 3rd inst. to consider a proposed Order requiring the marketing of all pigs sold for slaughter..    The Boardfs representatives opposed very strongly such a general provision as being disastrous to the attempts being made to induce cottagers and smallholders to keep pigs.Ordnance Survey.During the week 68,769 maps were sent to France and 14.363 to the Admiralty.     10 relief models were sent to France.Publications -Branch.The number of applications for ordinary issues of the Leaflets was 1,018, in response to which 4,658 copies of Loaflets were despatched.     In addition, 43,300 copies of Leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distributions     A further supply of 85,500 leaflets was sent to the Railway Companies for distribution through Booking Offices, as explained in previous Reportso
Fisheries, DivisioniPermit Section.     27 Permits have been issued and 51 cancelled.Arrangements have been made for the steam herring fishing fleet to commence working next week from English ports.     It will work from North Shields at first, under naval protection.gishermen^s Registration and Recruiting Section.SPj^li?2eJl^^ A draft of 103 men has beenselected for submission to She Admiralty in response i:o a request for further entries into Secfcidn &quot;T1&quot;&apos;.     A further request for 100 is to hand.tfishermen, Fish Trade and Military Service.     The Ministry of National Service have coccurred in a proposal that the organised trade should receive from the Board an intimation that caees of men called for tho Army&apos;who are regarded as of vital importance to the fishing industry should be communicated to the Board in order that the question whether the Ministry should be apr;cached with a view to securing exemption may be considered,     Tne trade will be circulated accordingly and the Regional Directors of National Service advised.     The Ministry will be asked whether they approve of a similar course being pursued in the event of further Decertifying Orders being made.     Scarborough has been visited in connection with the supply of labour required during the herring season.     There appear to be only three curing firms always working at that port, and those have been advised to communicate to the Board any labour needs they are unable to meet by their own efforts.     Carting is probably adequate accept in times of large landings, and there is some hope of obtaining the use of Military lorries in these cases.Fishermen and the Special Franchise.     Cards received from fishermen claiming the rrancmee under the arrangements made by the th* Local Government Board for men on service have been despatched to the District Registrars.Motor Loan Section.       The Motor Loan Committee have installing ;mechaiTics^wTth continuous work in hand stationed at Lcwestoft and Yarmouth, at Folkestone, at Hastings and at Southwick, and one: in the West Country.     The success of the work they have carried out and the increasing appreciation of the motor in fishing boats has brought about a change in the character of their operations which is inevitably reflected in the reports.     There are no longer victories to record:   they are engaged in organising what they have won.     The days are past when each type of boat and each fishing port presented new problems;   and each successful installation was a triumph over doubt.     The problem is now one of organisation, to arrange that the mechanic who has just finished the installation in one boat shall find that the shipwright has the bearers ready in another;   to place orders for propellers, shafting, tanks, and other accessories where delivery can be given at the right moment; to keep the fishermen standing idle for the shortest time and to   lay plans ahead to satisfy the impatient applicant.     with firms short-handed and railway transport slow it is not to be expected that all should go without a hitch.     But now attention and energy are mainly absorbed in keeping staoclh the flew of work.     It is the interruptions and obstacles, not the successes, that break the surface;   and the completion of an installation is but a point passed by a smooth and steady stream.
Fish Food Section. 7Canning of Fish.     There is a gratifying increase in the number of firms who are taking up the canning of fish, or the making cf fish paste, and this does not involve an increase in the quantity cf Tin Plate used, as glass bottles are employed in place of tin.     The amount of tin plate allotted to the Board for the month of liay was in excess of their requirements, and a portion of this has accordingly be?n released to the Ministry of Food for other purposes.Freshwater Fish Committee.     The sale of Elvers has continued and it is estimated that over 1,000,000 hive been ordered to date. Sales will probably terminate at the end of the week, as the run of Elvers will have come to an&apos; end.     The results attained are considered satisfactory.The normal work of the Board proceeds   on lines indicated in previous reports.Secretary.10th May4 1918.
