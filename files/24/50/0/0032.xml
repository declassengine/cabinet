(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty1 s Government)SECRET,Par Jabinetmtkinute .4 and ;;;T.3060)PARLIAMENTARY PROCEPpRg^ Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.On the 17th lanuary the War Cabinet had under consideration the question of the Parliamentary Procedure to he adopted in dealing with the various Reconstruction problems that would arise on the termination of the War. The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he did not regard a Select Committee as practicable, and that he had arranged for me to confer with the Government Whips on the subject.The War Cabinet decided to postpone consideration of the question until a further communication was received from me,I have now had the question further examined, and have held a Conference,- over which the Home Secretary was good enough to presido.    I attach hereto Sir George CaveU Report of the Conference, in which it is recommended that the House of Commons should he asked to appoint a select Committee to consider and report upon the procedure to be adopted*I am in agreement with the recommendations as set out in the Report and I should bo glad to have the decision of the War Cabinet upon the matter.
A Conference was held on April 10th to consider what steps should be taken to deal at short notice with emergency measures which in the absence of legislation to the contrary would $apse either on the termination of the War, or at various periods thereafter.The following Members were present:*The Home Secretary (In the Chair)The Minister of Reconstruction.The Paymaster-General.Capt. The Eon F6E. Guest D.S.O., M.P.,Mr. J.F. Hope M.P.,The Rt. Hon. Lord Edmund Talbot, M.P.* The Rt. Eon, J.H, Whltley, M.P.,Three methods were suggested, namely:-(1.) A short general Bill enabling the Emergency Statutes or any of them to be continued by Order in Council,(2) A detailed Bill setting out the provisions which the Government desire to continue and the periods for which they should be continued.(3) The appointment of a Select Committee of the House of Commons to consider and report as to the steps to be taken.The Committee are op opinion that the course numbered (3) should be adopted.     The Introduction of a Bill without previous reference to a committee would lead to considerable discussion and loss of timej but it seems probable that the House would be willing to give effect without much discussion to any course recommended by a Select Committoe,It may be possible at a later date to refer to thesame/
earns Committee the wider question referred to in the. Hiriutes of War Cabinet 324 (Minute 14), namely, the question of adopting a special P?rXls:nentaey Procedure in connection with tha numerous measures dealing with reconstruction which will require consideration at the termination of the war.The Committee therefore recommend that the House of Commons be asked to appoint a Select Committee to consider and report whether it is desirable to make any and what provisions (1) for defining the meaning of the phrase &quot;end of the war&quot; and other similar phrases occurring in the war Emergeaey Statutes and (2) for extending or. shortening the period of operation of any of those statutes and any regulations made thereunder *The several Departments should be requested to furnish information as to the legislation which they may desire to be.prolonged to the Minister of Reconstruction who will tabulate the information obtained and lay it before the Select Committee,
