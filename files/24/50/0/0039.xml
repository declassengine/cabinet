V[yms^Gciiment is the Property..of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] FCONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.[April 25, 1918.]Poland /00LIf/ i&apos;&apos;Ui I i^.3^gE POLITICAL SITUATION IN POLAND.1. IN the elections for the Council of State in Warsaw the Inter-Party Union secured 37 out of 52 seats, the Moderate Activists 4, the Extreme Activists, i.e., those who favour a close alliance with the Central Powers, 8, and the Jews 3. We are informed that among the representatives of the Inter-Party Union a majority are Realists, who differ hut little from the Moderate Activists. This news, however, requires further confirmation. The contest was exclusively between the two Conser-vative or pseundo-democratic groups the Inter-Party Union and the &quot; Activists.&quot; The members of the Council of State were elected by the so-called Dietines and by the Municipal Councils of certain towns. The Dietines are small artificial bodies and can raise no claim whatsoever to a representative democratic character; in the German sphere of occupation they were appointed by the German authorities. For this reason the parties of the Left, the Radicals and Socialists, Avho have the greatest influence on the masses, decided to boycott the Council of State, and refrained from taking any part in the elections the 5 Dietines in which they are in a majority returned no represen-tatives at all to the Council of State. They see in the summoning of an undemocratic and unrepresentative Council of State a manoeuvre on the part of the Germans and of the Polish Conservatives to postpone the summoning of a democratic Diet, and have therefore refused to give theo Council their moral sanction by taking part in the &quot;elections.&quot;2. The result of the elections is likely to be considered satisfactory from the point of view of the Regency Council and the existing Polish Government. All the three Regents have until recently been closely connected with the Inter-Party Union Count Ostrowski has actually been the first President of the Realist party. Also the secretary of the Regency Council, Mgr. Chelmicki, was at one time President of the Realist party, and until January 1917 a member of its executive committee. Most of the other posts in the secretariat of the Regency Council are filled by late or actual members of the Inter-Party Union. The Minister of the Interior in the Cabinet of M. Kucharzewski was M. J. Stecki, who, until he took office, was the.chief leader of the Inter-Party Union in the Austrian sphere of occupation (which did not prevent him from being on very good terms with the Austrian authorities). On becoming Minister of the Interior, he formally resigned from the Inter-Party Union, but is reported to have remained in close touch with it. He retains his post in the present Cabinet of M. Steczkowski, and is the only politician of note among its members. It was he who organised and conducted the elections to the Council of State. Lastly, in February 1918, the Inter-Party Union at Warsaw acknowledged the Regency Council as representing the national sovereignty of Poland, and thus took a line obviously at variance with the policy of the Polish National Committee abroad. We cannot say what the exact mutual relations of the Regency Council and the Inter-Party Union are at the present moment, not having received any Polish papers later than the 20th March ; and these relations are continually changing, because the personal element counts in them for quite as much as the political.3. If anything, it is surprising that the extreme Activists should have secured eight seats. After the Cholm incident all possibility of an imderstanding with the Central Powers seemed to have disappeared, and the Regency Council itself had declared it in so many words. Then, towards the end of February, Count Adam Bonikier and Prince Francis Radziwill started out for Berlin and Vienna with a new scheme of compromise which seems to have been suggested by the &quot; conquests &quot; of General Dowbor-Musnicki&apos;s Polish army in White Russia. Germany was to renounce all idea of new annexations in Poland and was to concede to the Poles a wide extension of territory in White Russia in the Governments of Grodna, Minsk, and Mohileff. At that price the Poles were to renounce the Polish national claims to Prussian Poland, and to agree to a close military and economic alliance with Germany. This programme, described as &quot; Polen anderwarts beschaftigen&quot; (to employ the Poles[367-8]
in a different direction, i.e., to divert their attention from Prussian Poland), gained the support of distinguished German politicians such as Naumanu. Erzberger, Hans Delbiiick, and David. It is obvious that an extension of Polish dominion over White Russian territory would involve Poland in a permanent feud with Russia, and possibly also with the Ukraine and Lithuania, and thus render her absolutely dependent on Germany. The Prussian Conservatives and the military party under the leadership of Ludendorff, himself a native of Posnania, favour the opposite plan of &quot; putting the lid on Poland &quot; (&quot; Polen einkapseln &quot;). Germany is to seek strategic guarantees,&quot; i.e., is to annex in North-Western Poland the district north of the Narev, and in the south-west the invaluable mining districts of Tchenstochova and Dombrova, without which Poland cannot exist. In the east slices of Polish territory are to be ceded to Lithuania and the Ukraine, and a common frontier established between these two States in White Russia is to complete Poland&apos;s encirclement.On the 25th February Count Hertling stated in his speech that &quot; in the regulation of the frontier question only what is indispensable on military grounds will be demanded by Germany.&quot; This seemed like favouring the militarist plan. In an interview given to a representative oE the &quot; Lokal-Anzeiger&quot; on the 14th March Hindenburg and Ludendorff reasserted the necessity of &quot; frontier rectifications.&quot; Yet in his speech of the 18th March the Chancellor seemed to incline towards the proposals submitted to him by Erzberger, Naumann, and David. &quot; Suggestions for the shaping of our future relationship have recently reached the Government and members of the Reichstag from political circles in Poland. We shall now gladly examine whether, and to what extent, these proposals are reconcilable with the aims pursued by the two Governments (of the Central Powers).&quot; With the offensive in the West the militarist party seems, however, to have absolutely established its ascendancy in Germany, and on the 9th April Herr von Eisenhart-Rothe, Prussian Minister of Agriculture, spoke again about the &quot; demand that adequate regard be paid to her (Prussia&apos;s) military interests,&quot; and added the following pointed remark : &quot; We must demand that the agreements on peace shall be settled between the Governments themselves, and that no one, not even parliamentarians, shall interfere therein.&quot; It is true that in the Prussian Cabinet the militarist view had always been favoured much more than in the Imperial Government. Yet a responsible Cabinet Minister could hardly have made a statement such as that of Herr ven Eisenhart-Rothe if the other proposals continued to be &quot;gladly examined.&quot;The Extreme Polish Activists thus seem to have suffered failure in their attempt to reach an understanding with Berlin, and Po]and&apos;s existence as a State is in danger. In these circumstances it is indeed surprising that the Extreme Activists should have secured eight sents in the Council, and this fact serves only as further proof of the unrepresentative character of that Assembly.4. There is bitter hatred of Germany everywhere in Poland. Yet the opposition of the Inter-Party Union to Germany is condemned to utter ineffectiveness. A common social interest draws a line in that struggle to both sides and neither of them dares to cross it. Nothing in Poland short of a popular revolutionary movement could seriously embarrass the Germans. Still, at no time could such a movement arise on purely national grounds, least of all can it at the present day. But if this is to be a social revolutionary movement, the adherents of the Inter-Party Union (as well as the Activists) are even more frightened of such a movement than the Germans are. This may not be so in the case of individual leaders-individual views cannot be deduced from general premises. Nor is it a condemnation of an entire class ; there is no condemning of an attitude which is unavoidable in its nature, and the instinet of self-preservation exists in classes and nations, even more strongly than in individuals. But one has to face facts : the Germans know very well that the leaders of the Inter-Party Union at Warsaw will not dare to stir up revolution. On the other hand, those among the gentry and bourgeoisie who follow the lead of the Inter-Party Union know very well that the Germans can never abandon them to their peasants and workmen, because playing with revolution is too dangerous in these days, and, as Herr von xCuhlmann openly said at Brest-Litovsk, the Germans cannot afford to admit Bolshevik experiments so near their own frontier.This explains why the Germans have never bothered to arrest or deport any of the leaders of the Inter-Party Union, though they have arrested Radicals and Socialists by the thousand.5. From our own point of view it is certainly satisfactory if, the Inter-Party Union continues to oppose^ the Germans, and if under those circumstances the Inter-Party Union and not the Extreme Activists fill the posts in the Polish Government and the leats in the Council of State.   Yet there is an obvious danger in these developments-
the Inter-Party Union as a group is rapidly becoming &quot; ininisteriable.&quot; It must further be remembered that the chief reason why so far the Polish upper classes have not come to terms with the Germans is that the Germans have never offered them any terms such as even the Extreme Activists would have been able to accept. To avoid disappointments and miscalculation we must clearly keep in mind on what grounds and conditions, and up to what point, we can count on the support of the Inter-Party Union: (a.) Their anti-German feelings might result in action if there was the possibility of a strong Conservative Power, such as the Russia of 1914 or 1916, entering Poland. Kerensky and even Milyukof would have been much too Radical for them.(b.) In case of revolution spreading to Austria and Poland, the Inter-Party Union as a group is certain to join the counter-revolutionaries, whoever they mav be.^ a/(c.) Should the Germans offer favourable terms to the Poles (of which there does not seem to be the slightest chance) it is hard to say what the Inter-Party Union as a whole would do. They are longing for office and are &quot; conciliatories &quot; by tradition, nature, and interests.(d.) As long as the Germans do not offer such terms, and continue to threaten Poland with annexations, no Poles can actively co-operate with them, by whatever name they call themselves.(e.) Individual emigre leaders can no more prescribe to the Inter-Party Union at Warsaw its policy than they could to the Polish army in Russia, and therefore cannot be held personally responsible for it. They can merely be held responsible for the accounts they give of facts, if these accounts prove misleading.(/.) Even whilst the policy of the Inter-Party Union is considered consonant with our own purposes, a very sharp line must be drawn between their attitude in Poland and their attitude with regard to Lithuania, White Russia and the Ukraine, and most, of all with regard to Great Russia, which alone can serve as pivot for British policy in Eastern Europe. It is hard to see how policy of aggression on the part of Poland towards its neighbours in the East can ever square with our anti-German policy.
