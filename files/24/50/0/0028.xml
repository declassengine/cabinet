^uji      /f   ^ v^,-.,. Confidential.LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(1st May 1918.)i circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the intelligence and statistics section of the ministry of munitions on the labour position in munition industries.winston s. churchill.i. strikes.during the week ending the 24th april, 3,935 working days or one-fortieth - of 1 per cent, of the possible working time were lost through strikes on munition work.the most serious loss of time occurred at the works of the castner-kellner alkali company, ltd. (wallsend-on-tyne), where the delay of the management to meet representatives of the men caused a stoppage of continuous process work for two days, and the loss of a still longer period before work could be fully restarted. nearly a third of the total loss of time during the week was occasioned by this dispute.ii.-machinery for recruiting.in carrying out the system of recruiting from firms in which the ministry of munitions is specially concerned, some difficulty has arisen from the dual control exercised by the ministry of national service and the ministry of munitions. in particular, undue complexity of office procedure has been involved in co-ordinating the functions of the local officials, the munitions area recruiting officers acting for the ministry of national service, and the munitions area dilution officers who are officials of the ministry of munitions. to avoid the appreciable waste of time, effort, and expense thus caused, an agreement has been made between the two ministries. under the new arrangement, the whole control of the munitions area recruiting offices will be handed over to the ministry of munitions. the present distribution of functions between the two departments will not be altered : the ministry of munitions will still be responsible for selecting the men to be called up under the regulations in force, and the ministry of national service for calling them up.iii.-war munition volunteers.in order that the recruiting of a proportion of the men fit for combatant service engaged in the munition industries may not result in a diminished output of munitions, it is obviously necessary that the labour remaining available should be * made more mobile. to that end, not only is an appeal being issued, urgently pressing workmen to enrol as war munition volunteers, but arrangements are being put in force which may be expected to make the appeal effective. workmen of military age, exempted from military service on the ground that they can be of more use to their country in the factories than in the field, will have a plain alternative put to them. in cases where men are found to be surplus to the requirement of firms, they will be asked to enrol as war munition volunteers; if they refuse, they will, if of military age and fitness, run the risk of losing occupational protection and of being required to enlist; if over military age, or of a lower medical category than is required by the army, they will run the risk of being dismissed. specially hard cases will be considered on their merits; but the general rule will be applied. by these means it may be hoped to secure an adequate supply of labour which can, at any time, be moved to the places in which it is most urgently required, and can be kept in those places as long as the need for it continues.v   f83)5709   Pk 20   125   5/18   B&amp;S
IV.-DISTRIBUTION  OP  SKILLED LABOUR.With a view to exercising a greater control over the distribution of labour, it has been decided to make a more extensive use of the powers of the Ministry under Defence of the Realm Regulations 8 A. (b). The procedure will be the issue of an embargo letter forbidding the engagement of labour either by a particular firm or by a group of firms.Hitherto such an embargo has been placed on firms as a penal measure, but in future it will not necessarily have this character. It may, for example, be placed on firms which are likely to attract an excess of skilled labour because good housing accommodation draws men away from other firms in the same district; it may he placed on a whole group of firms employing a certain type of labour in a certain area such as the firms in the London area employing sheet-metal workers-in order to facilitate control of a limited class of labour that is in great demand; or it may be used as an accompaniment to a dilution scheme in order to prevent the firm from filling up by the engagement of skilled labour the gap made by dilution.A firm on whom an embargo has been placed will he entitled at any time to apply for a licence to engage skilled labour which, under the embargo, they are prevented from engaging.
