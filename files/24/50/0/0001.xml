S E C R E.T.Copy No.    1 (CaG^. 1/158/452.30.4.1&amp;.SECURITY OF INDIA *In all recent telegrams from C-In-C, India,the underlying idea is that the security of India is at stake.    Though the 7far Office has from time to time kept India informed of information affecting the East, and on 14th March sent a comprehensive appreoiat-ion (App, At), nothing emanating from the V/ar Office could possibly have induced India to &quot;believe she is going to be attacked by either German or Turkish troops, except in the remote futuretfrom the India Office to the Viceroy which appears to have given rise to apprehension on the part of the C in Gt, India.     It should be noted that the telegram emanated from the Prime Minister and foreshadows the spread of military operations towards India.In War Office telegram 56859 of 21st April para.l. (App.C.) the War Office endeavoured to point out to India how the position stood, but from Indiars telegram.^ 51837 of 23rd April (App.D.) it appears that apprehen-sion of attack still remains uppermost in the C in C&apos;s mind.2. In consequence of this, India has proposed toform for use in Indialaying great stress on the formation of the 3 Infantry Brigades which are destined for the defence of the XBYBER PA3S.A telegram (App.B.) was hoitever sent on 2nd April2 Divisions.5 Infantry Brigades.6 Cavalry Regiments.
2.3, The actual-forces &apos;in India^ J^alehb-tine---and-Mesopotamia-,in June next are as shewn in App..

In any case India!s Rsservea are in Palestine and Mesopotamia whence Divisions (2 and 1 respectively) could be de3* patched at any mementoIt is also clear that neither the German nor Turk oan take the offensive in all theatres at the same time, neither can either eourrirry consecrate agai&amp;gt India without giving las at least many months^ warning    Whilst Germany is occupied in seeking a decision lib Wv&amp;m$ it is clear that she will not detach troops to attack India, and neither the German nor Turk could possibly attack India
except through Afghanistan (HERAT - KANDAHAR) or without railway construction on a large scaleTo sum up, it is considered :**(a) That India is unreasonably alarmed for her security.(b) That no attack other than Afghan-or tribal is possible except in the remote future, and that there is at present no indication of Afghan attack.(o)    That reinforcements for India are available now andalways will be when the occasion for their use arises,(d) That the forces now in India are sufficient for her security to-day and until a new situation arises *(e) In any case, the security of India or of any other sub-sidiary theatre must not freight against the successful prosecution of the War at the decisive point - in Prance.Decisions are therefore required on the following points :-(a) Are any additional formations to be raised for the defence of India?(b) If so, is India to form 3 Divisions in accordance with her first proposal, or only 3 Infantry Brigades, which latter she considers essential.     For the reasons above stated I do not consider that any additional formations are at present required, but I am not prepared to over-ride the opinions of the Coiw^&amp;or-In-Chief in India and recommend therefore that the formation of these latter 3 Brigades be sanctioned, whilst India makes every effort to raise new battalions for farther dilution of Divisions in Salonika.(o)   Is approval given to the proposal for transfers to be made from the Indian Cavalry now in ECKffT together withtheir
their horses^ with the object of forming 12 new squadrons in India on similar lines to the schema sanctioned for the formation of new Indian. Infantry-battalions? (See App. G.) I recommend that this should be done *(Set.) H. Wilson.0* I * Gr * S *30th April, 1918.
APPENDIX   A.From :*   C.I.G.S,    .^T* :-      C. in Ci India.   -G.O.C. in Ci Egypt &amp; Mesopotamia,.D. 10 p.m, 14.3.18,54240 cipher,.Summary of my appreciation of the situation as regards the Near East resulting from Russian and Roumanian collapse is as follows:1,     German access to Odessa will have little effect in Near East as either Constanza or Constantinople would serve as better base for German enterprise in the Caucasus, Russian Black Sea fleet having succumbed to Bolschevism.   German action has however been greatly facilitated by spread of Bolschevism to Caucasus,   General Staff foresaw these developments and therefore advocated Entente action in Armenia, Japanese intervention in Siberia and the maintenance of sufficient strength in Mesopotamia to exert our influence on Persian frontier.2,     Regarded broadly Germany hoped for dominant world power;(a) by enlarged facilities for naval expansion to enable her by contest British supremacy at sea.&apos;(b) By establishing complete control of Central Europe and Near East with a view to expansion eastwards, These aims hold good but method of attainment has been changed by course of war.3,     As regards (a) sh&apos;6 places her reliance on the U, boat which we must destroy..As regards (b) Germany&apos;s original plan was to obtain control of Balkans, and establish herself in Egypt and at head of Persian Gulf as shortest route to India.    This scheme has failed but collapse of Russia has opened a new route to the East by the Black Sea Caucasus and Caspian.   She will have secured northern flank of this line of advance if she can dominate Russia effectively and may even hope ultimately to reach the Pacific.4,,      Natural difficulties of communication and the spread of Bplschevism threaten to cut off from Armenia and even the Caspian and Germany will be quick to take advantage of the situation,Russians
Russians were evacuating Batoum on 19th Feb. and the port is open to enemy parties.   Although it is unlikely that Germany will be able to place any considerable bodies of troops in near future in this area we must expect a highly organised propaganda backed by small bodies of German troops who will neglect no means of undermining our power in the Easts59 Germany may adopt following measures:-(a).        Rs-organise agriculture and railways in Southern Russia.(b). Exploit Western Black Sea ports * (It is note-worthy that under Treaty with Roumania Constanza falls to Central Powers and not Bulgaria .(c) .        Establish small detachments and agents In Eastern Black So a ports *(d).        Endeavour to establish influence in Caucasia.(o) *        Expand eastwards by road rail and sea with a view to squeezing us out of Mesopotamia and Persia.6e We must answer by estatdishing a barrier to Germanprogress eastwards *   We must endeavour to convince our Allies and inparticular America that their interests are affected as well as ours-If Germany is left free to turn our flank by the Norty cur effortsbased on Mesopotamia and India may be ineffectual.   We shouldtherefore(a) .        Arrange immediately for Japanese Intervention in Siberia.with the greatest possible strength and energy*(b) .

following fron Prime Minister.     Begins.SiSCHSQJ.     While ic is early to estimate the final results of the present battle it is already quite::clear that the fundamental problem before the Allies is man-power.   Unless the enemy succeeds in achieving his full purpose in this battle, which we have good hope of preventing, he will certainly refit as rapjr&amp;ly as possible in the hops of striking another blow before we are ready to meet it.     He has proved his capacity in this battle to drive in the T/estern front, i&apos;he future course of the war therefore depends upon our ability to refit our armies as fast as he can, and the difficult tine is likely to come in May, June and July.    In order to do this we shall have to draw upon all our available resources. At the same tihae the area of the war is spreading steadily eastwards.     It may be necessary therefore for India to deal with the emergencies which arise in that theatre without our beinp able to reinforce it from the Westc     Recruiting, I know, has &quot;been exceptionally good in India lately, and I have no doubt that this new effort on the part of the Germans to tyrannise over the world will awaken India to see mere clearly the danger which menaces hera    I think, therefore, that you should take this opportunity to do everything in your power to increase the Indian establishment for war, net only in troops but in railway material and military equipment of all kindsn     flease let me knoi? as seen as you can what you think is possiblo in this direction.

SECRET,From: - War Office,To : -     C u - in - C n, In d i a,Kc, 56359 of 21st April,Your 29076 of 13th April,       fart 1. Your basisof calculation appears to be that forces other than Afghan or tribal will threaten India,       We cannot agree that either Turkish or German troops will find their way to within striking distance of the Indian Frontier except in the remote future by which time forces should bo available to meet any contingency which may arise cn your frontier* But so long as Germany seeks a decision in France no German troops will be detached for minor enterprises,     if Germany fails in her object in Europe it is clear that she will require her full strength to resist allied effort,. It is further thought that the Increase to the Indian Army for the defence of India should not be undertaken at the expense of France and that whatever units India can raise over and above her present establishment should be utilised in releasing British troops in minor theatres for service in France wherever this is possible,Reference Part 2*    The proposal to raise a new division in Egypt has been abandoned for the present.     After the con-version of the 4 divisions now in Egypt Is completed, a further 3 6 Indian line battalions with 4 Pioneer, battalions will be required for a proposed conversion of 4 British divisions at Salonika,       It is presumed you will prefer to form these battalions on the lines indicated in your 29 06 of April 15th,
As seme ni sunder standings may have arisen owing to telegrams crossing, the following is a recapitulation of our requirements in addition to those stated in parae 2:-Eor the mixed divisions in Egypt a total of 36 Indian, line and 4 Pioneer &quot;battalions is required.     Of these, 4 line &quot;battalions have been with 75th Divisio since last year, 8 lino and 1 Pioneer battalion have lately arrived, leaving 24 line and 3 Pioneer Battalions still duer     Presumably those still due - &quot;&apos;.    will now reach Egypt by end of May.Assuming that the formation of additional divisions for the defence of India will not be proceeded with at present, we require to know urgently at what rate the battalions for Salonika (vide para-.2 above) can be formed.
Operateorb,From     C, in C.j India, To        War Office.Despatched 10.20 p.m. 2Srd April 1918, Received 4 a,m. 25th April 1918,31s37.Your 56859 April 21st part 1.1,    please do not think that we are not fully alive te your needs.2.     In xay 29076 I etated clearly the tonsiderations which led me to conclude that rthe most effective way in which India ftould assist the Empire by relieving troops for France was to be so strong in India as to impress Asia with her armed strength and so deter disorder within and attach from without.     I Btated that this force was to be a general reserve in the east if not required &quot;by India.3.    There has been a material change, to our disadvantage, in the situatien in the east, while at the same time India has added to her responsibilities in the maintenance of our forces in Palestine and Mesopotamia and is now requested to do the same in Salonika.4.     You will remember that the Indian War Establishment is now short of 2 oavalry and 3 infantry divisions and that this shortage was recognised *by War Office arrangements referred to in my 22677 March 21st under which 2 divisions were ready earmarked in Egypt to make good this shortage whenever situation made it necessary,5,     I quite agree that no German troops should be detached for enterprises in the east, but I do not find the same argument applies to Turkish troops under German leadership while I cannot reconcile your views on this question with the intelligence coming in 56867 April 23iat from &amp;.M.I* and from Secretary of State to Videroy under his number nil April 8th or with C.I,G.S. auaber March 14th.6.     In any case I do not feel justified in foregoing the organization of the 3 infantry brigades required immediately to oomplste the troops allotted to the Khyber area.7,    Regarding the provision of officers and other points in my 29076 not yet answered by you as well as those in parts 2 and 3 in your telegram under reply I shall address you further.8,     You will see from part 5 of my 29076   that I oan give you 13 battalions by December 1918 and another 13 by May 1919.   Further depletion of India*s forces or dilution of her fighting strength is not permitted by the situation in India.9,     The effective security of India is a question so vital to imperial interests that the Government of India propose to ask Secretary of State for India whether the viewB set forth in your telegram under reply are endorsed by the Tar Cabinet.

THE SECURITY OP INDIA.1, The following Turkish forces may be regarded as available for operations, hut owing to lack of transport they are not mobile and oould operate only in districts where they tsuld live on the oountry:(a) Greater part of the foroes in Armenia - nominally V divisions - with a combatant strength of 56,000 and rifle strength of 31,&amp;00.(b) Reserve at Mosul and Rowanduz of 5,750 0 6E.batar.tB, cr 2,100 rifles,2,     The occupation of Azerbaijan by a small Turkish force is known to be on the point of execution, and for this scheme a part of the 5th Division \ex-Armeniaj and a detaohment from the 6th Army (Mesopotamia) hare been detailed.The snow tn the frontier of N.W. Persia will disappear during May and   Turkish garrisons will not improbably be established (if no offensive action is taken by General Marshall] at Knoi, Tabriz, Maraga, Miana, Suj Bulak and Sakkiz by the miadde of noxt month, Batum, Kars, and probably Erivan, will air be garrisoned by Turkish troops (now in Armenia) In the near future,A Turkish occupation of Azerbaijan has T*een contemplated, with a view to post bellura retention, for some time past, and the German High command will no doubt encourage Turkish aspirations in this area so as to establish there, at an eq-rly date, a right flank guard to secure the advance   of a German or Turcc-German foroe through Trans-Caspia and also block an anticipated British adTance via Persia into Armenia,3,     It would be feasible for a,small Turkish force, say a battalion^ a machine gun company and a battery, to maroh from Rowanduz through Persia to Herat in 2$ to 3 months, but it is far more likely that the Trans-Caspian route via Krasnovodsk and Uerv would be utilised for the movement of troops to Afghanistan,   The Mohammedan elements of Turkestan would render considerable assistance - more particularly to the Germans - in matters of transport, supply and labour,There would be no insuperable difficulty in transporting to the Afghan frontier (by the Trans-Caspian route) a force of 8 or 10 German and Turkish divisions by the end of the year, but the great difficulties of supplying a foreo cf suoh size in Afghanistan render it most improbable that, unless and until the Merv railway is extended   via Herat to Kandahar, any suoh force would be despatched for operations on the Indian frontier.The main purpose of a Turco-Geeman expedition would be to show sufficient strength in . -Afghanistan to exoite the enthusiasm of the population and ensure tne Afghan Army making a deliberate more &apos;  -against India, stirring up    by its advance the tribes on the NoW, Frontier and thus forcing us to send reinforcements from Egypt and Mesopotamia to India.   Eor thi3 purps-se a small f*rce only would be required.It
It is, moreover, open to considerable doubt whether the Afghans Would accord a friendly reception to a force Of Christians marching through &quot;Afghanistan,   in Tiew of this uncertain faoter and of the obrioue difficulties as regards the supply and transport of a large, and especially ef a     European, fcroe operating well away from a railhead, it is net reasonable to anticipate that under present conditions In Afghanistan any serious Turce*German operations -apart from action by the Afghan Army - can materialize,4* If an tffensito policy ia adopted at an early date by General Marshall In the direction of Kerkuk - Suleimaniyeh, the existingsituation will probably undergs a complete ohange, for the attention of the Turks will be rireted on the security of Mosul, which will result in the available Turkish forces in Armenia owning to the immediate aid of the 6th Army, and in the abandonment of the Azerbaijan project.
APPE1IDIX_SECRET OPERATION.Prom        C. in        India9 To War Office.Despatched 8,15 pam* 13th April, 1918* Received   12oi0 a;mf 15th April, 19I8629076 April 13th,Your 55648 cipher April 3rd and Secretary of State for India5s telegram of April 2nd.lc 3 main considerations are disclosed in the telegrams reaching, India from Secretary of State for India and yourself namely       (a) Indian troops are promptly required in Egypt;  (b)  the north-west frontier of India is threatened directly by the eastward spread of the war; (c) India may have to rely in men and material on her own resources.    Therefore in order that the War Cabinet may have an appreciation of our position and of the extent to which India can assist in the liberation of troops from Egypt to France I send the following Part 1.    Strategical Conditions in I.ndia0 In this war hitherto the brunt of an Afghan Cum Tribal attack would have been directed against the area between the Kabul and the Gomal rivers their main forces being, in the Khyber region.,       Our preparations against this contemplated holding (?) Land! Kotal, the Miranaai and the Kurram, while withdrawing: if necessary from the Tochi and Gomal to the plains. The (?) apparently increasing hostilitydisplayed
displayed,  gainst us by the Russian communities now in power has altered profoundly the strategical outlook.     The fact must be faced, unless a change of Russian sentiment occurs, that it is not beyond tlhe power of German organization using the Russian railways to place at the railheads bordering the Afghanistan frontier a force of considerable strength.      Their progress from thence will depend on the transport with which the force is equipped.   The route by which a forward movement against ue will be made must remain uncertain but the conditions of the Terrain suggest an advance from Khushk Kandaharon Quetta. In dealing with North Persia our Mirjawa Railway will assist us and should enable us to deny Sistan and the lower He Inland but its extension northward will be necessary via west edge&apos;of Hamun before we can threaten the flank of a force moving through Parah on the He rat-Kan da baa roads.   But whether this be feasible or not in the time available the defence of Quetta becomes more important and requires a greater force than we have considered necessary hitherto.   We estimate this addition at a minimum of 1 India Division and 6 Regiments of Cavalry plus any force we may employ in Sistan.2*    In the North developments may lead to enemy forces either from Herat or the Oxus reaching Kabul.   (?)   In any case we apprehend that their plan will be as a preliminary to an Afghanistan move to embroil us with the tribes and we desire now therefore to organise our reserves so as to enable us to concentrate 2 complete divisions rapidly at (?) Landi Kotal plus L. of C. troops in the Khyber plus occupation troops in the Peshawar plain and?Miranzai
? Miranzai Valley.,   We require for this 3 additional Infantry Brigades, 1 to replace the 1  chat Brigade in 2nd Division, I to be in reserve for the Miranzai. and 1 for use on Khyber L, of Co3o     Our general reserve will than be 1 division which is not sufficient and in order that we :^ay be in a better position to deal with developments either in the south cr north we desire to add another division,4,     The above additions to India5s force total 2 Indian Divisions 6 Cavalry Regiments and 3 Infantry Brigades *   Later divisional troops would be formed for a 3rd Division in readiness to organise if required the 3 Infantry Brigades into a Divisionf,   Where the enemy may make Ms effort in the east it is impossible for us to forecast but if not against India then the above force-as a general reserve is available In the other eastern theatres,    Its training and. organisation continue in the meantime under conditions permitting of greater comfort and health than those of a more active theatre, while the existence of these forces will tend to keep India itself quiet as well to restrain Afghanistan and tribes from hostilities.Part^ 2Reinforcements for ggyptInfantry for Egypt can be found as follows-, provided you approve of the proposal contained in my 27594 April Sth By expansion iinJSgynt^ 6 Line Battalions;1 Pioneer Battalion being replaced by men of at least 6 months service,,5t

These will be raised to complete our requirements.Medical.   As regards personnel you will know our position from telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India Number 7942 dated Hay 30th, 1917.Should this scheme be. accepted you should inform me what assistance I may expect from you especially in Senior Officers.With exception of 3 Motor Ambulance Convoys which will have to be provided equipment is available .Transport.   With a view to the most economical utilization of our resources this question is being reviewed, but it is quite clear that we shall have to rely on a light form of Mechanical Transport in a great measure such as Pord Vans.Please say in your reply whether as a first consignment 3,000 with complement of workshops could be made (?) ready in America at an early date.Personnel can be trained from Indian rank3 at school in India.x      X X X X X
