Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.ST! -As a result of diplomatic correspondence in the Spring of 1917, HisMajeBty!s Government and the German Government undertook to withdraw all prisoners--of-war to a o.istance of at least 30 Kilometres from their firing lines*   l&apos;hie was effected &quot;by us and notified to the German Government in Mfy. and an assurance that this had &quot;been done &quot;by the Cfermah Aut2?cri**ies was oommunioated to us in Julye   The Tvhite pepei- 0cv8C8S of April, 1918, shews that this Agreement has never, in fact, &quot;been Observed hy the German Authorities and evidence from men who have recently escaped from the German lines to our own shews that even up to last month our men, when taken prisoner, were employed within a few miles of the German lines on work directly opposed to that whioh is permissible under the Hague Convention, and in some cases exposed to our shell fire.   On one occasion our men were forced to carry rations for German soldiers up to the most advanced positions,24       The oalcuiated brutalities to which our men ?rorking close behind the German lines were exposed during the Spring of 1917, When the Germans pretended that these were in the nature of reprisals for similar treatment of their prisoners by us, have, it seems, ceased to some extent, but there is no question but that they are still treated with great harshness, and the conditions under which they live are such as to cause muoh suffering. i;3*        The conditions of existence of prisoners in German occupied territory are very bad even when compared with those Which are their lot in Germany.(a) Work is enforced by brutal means, men who are ill and half starved being forced to labour,   They were, until recently at any rate, sent back to Germany only when no more work could be got out of them,(b) The extremely scanty ration, owing to lack of means of transport or failure of organisation, is scarcely ever supplemented by supplies sent from this country. Parcels seldom reach men so situated,(c) The men are frequently robbed of their clothing, and, again owing to their inaccessibility, supplies from this [ country fail to reach them,(d) Correspondence from and to these men is much restricted, as, apart from the difficulties of communi-cation, the German Authorities do not provide them with the requirements for letter writing, and much avoidable misery ia thereby caused to their relatives,(e) There are gxsat delays in notifying captures of men when held in occupied territory,(f) The accommodation provided is often overcrowded and unsuitable.(g)     There is no inspection by neutrals.
4.      pretests having proved useless, the only steps that can &quot;be taken seem to be in the form of reprisals, but, before adopting this course, it is advisable to have reasonable assurance that such measures as are ta&amp;en will result in benefit to British prisoners-of-War in German hands.   There must also be a determina* tion to pursue these measures to the uttermost.5,      Reprisals have hitherto as a rule taken the form of subjecting prisoners-of-war in our hands to treatment as far as possible similar to that of whioh we have reason to complain.On these lines reprisals might take the following forms:-(a) Repudiation of our undertaking not to employ prisoners-of-war within the 30 Kilometre limit,(b) The adoption of brutal methods of coercion, (o) Reduction of the ration,,(d) Restriction on correspondence and the receipt of parcels(e) Delay in the notification of casualties.(f) The provision of bad accommodation.and all the above with the exception of (a)   could be enforced on German prisoners-of-war both in this country and France or in Prance alone,The following points are worthy of consideration in regard to the above-mentioned suggestions-;-(a) This, while perhaps advantageous to us from the point of view of labour, would probably result in a resumption of the specially brutal treatment of our prisoners-of^?ar whioh was enforced last year,(b) On the whole, the labour of prisoners-of-war has been satisfactory, and, apart from whether we cculd enforce the harsh&quot;methods employed in Germany, it is questionableif we&quot; should get more work out of the prisoners by suoh means,(c) The present ration is low for workers and just sufficient for others.   The amount of work has unquestionably fallen off since the present scale was adopted, especially since no addition to the ration can now be brought in this country,(d) Owing to shortage in Germany few parcels are sent to German prisoners in our hands as compared v/ith those sent to British prisoners from this country.   Artificial restrictions imposed on our men in Germany would havea disastrous effect.The need for neutral inspection of prisoners-of-war in occupied territories has frequently been urged on Germany, but has never been conceded.   Ue, accordingly, do not allow such inspection of prisoners-of-war in Prance,7th Hay, 1918.
