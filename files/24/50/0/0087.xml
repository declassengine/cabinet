WAR CABINET2^gocornent is the Property Of   (^J        7*     ^ ^ 1sJ$H.ta.pn:-e r&apos;* GovernmentIRISH BILLCommitteeA full meeting of the Cabinet on the Irish Bill was held to-day, all the Members being present.   Some dis-cussion took place upon the general character, and Upon some of the provisions., of the Draft Bill, but it was pointedout by the Chairman that the Bill was by no means yet complete and that therefore, the discussion could only be of a very limited character.    For instance, he stated that in addition to the financial clauses which have not yet been approved by the Treasury, it would, be necessary for the Committee to consider one or two very important questions, notably in relation to the future position in regard to the salary and pension of the Irish Civil Service and the Police Force.    These  are not   easy questions and in the opinion ef the Chairman it is most desirable  that the Committee should have the benefit of the views of the Irish Government who have, of course, not yet assumed Office.It was however strongly urged by General Smuts that the Committee should not onter upon the consideration of the Bill until it was complete in every respect, and this view found acceptance with most of the Members, if net all.    At .all events, it was eventually unanimously adopted by the Committee.Discussion then arose upon the general aspects of tjie Governments   Irish policy.    Considerable differences of opinion became manifest, but upon one point every Member of the Committee was agreed, namely,. that as a preliminary to proceeding with the Government policy either in respect to conscription or of the grant of self-Government to Irelandit
it r;as first necessary that the new Irish Acini L-istrst ion shoulrestore respect for government, enforce the law and, above allput down with a stern hand the Irish-German conspiracy whichappears to be widespread in Ireland.
