&apos;THIS DOCUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).WAR   CABINET.MEXICAN    SITUATION.(Note by the C.I.G.S. covering memo by the General Staff) ._The Secretary,War Cabinet.I forward the attached Memorandum for the information of the War Cabinet, although a telegram on this subject has been sent during the course of the last few days (Foreign Office to Lord Reading No. 2788 of May 7th).   This telegram does not in my opinion sufficiently emphasize the military aspect of the situation in Mexico nor the need   for immediate action and I consider that a further telegram should be sent in which stress might be laid on these points.(Signed) Henry Wilson, C.I.G.S.War Office,9th. May, 1918.S E CJE T. G.T. 4482.
2h a\K      . IvEBXICAH SITUATION1,     Owing to the unfortunate policy of drift adopted by the United States Government the situation in Mexico has now reached&quot; a crisis which demands immediate aotion if the progress cf Allied operations is not to be seriously prejudiced?Since the entry of the T/nited States into the war the German policy has aimed at embroiling Mexieo with the United States and thus, by forcing intervention, to interfere with the despatch of troops and war material to Europe. With this object $hey have undoubtedly intrigued with Carranza and have attempted not only to involve Moxioc but also Japan in plots against the Entente.Moreover, if anything oould consolidate the numerous factions in Mexico and rally them to Carranza, now the avowed enemy of the Allies, it would be intervention by the hated America^ troaps*   Thus would the main object &amp;f Gorman policy be crowned with complete success^In spite of the semi-official recognition *f Carranza by the United States Government his acts cf almost open aggression and hostility have daily become more evert *   Rumours are rife that he is now only awaiting the favourable development of the German &apos; offensive on the Western Front to deolare war against the United States,    There are believed to  &quot;be between 4,000 and 5,000 German reservists in Mexico who would join Carranza.   Many of these are in camps between Tampico and S* Luis Potosi, and sionstitutOj therefore, a serious danger to the oilfields.2.     Since October 1917 the States Department have been kept fully informed by H.K.Government of German intrigues in Mexico, but this frankness has not been, reaiprsoal. They have negotiated secretly first with Carranza and then with one of the opposing leaders such as Senor Iturbide cr 23-cminquez, but whan approaohed by the British Government with Suggestions for j,oipt and definite action on the part of the Allies these secret negotiations (which according to Mr. Kohler would seriously damags Brltich oomme^cial interests in Mexico) are disowned; and K*MaG. are assured that the United States Government have some definite scheme for meeting any eventualities,   horeover, they appear to view with complacency the possibility of open hostilities with Kexioo as likely to furnish excellent opportunities for the training of their troops *It must be borne in mind that before the aubjugation of Mexice was accomplished intervention would possibly involve the despatch of at least half a million troops to that country,. according to the calculation of the American General Staff. This represents the diversion of some 20 American divisions from the Western Front and multiplies the existing difficulties of providing artillery for future divisions of their Expedition-ary Forco, a matter which is already causing grave soncern*It should be noted that it has taken IS months to send $ American divisions to Europa,and consequently as troops would be required - in Mexico immediately war was declared many months delay would be involved by this diversion,.Armed,
Armed intervention, therefore, by TJ.S.A. is strongly to be deprecated.3.     It appears to be imperative to urge on President r/ilson, and that- too, without further delay, the   necessity of adopting a definite policy of conjoint action in consultation with France and Great Britain, whose interests at stake are no less than those of the U,S.A*Such action might take either of the following forms:- .(a) The definite recognition of Carranza as President supported by a promise of moral and financial support, provided he declares himself   openly to be in favour of the Entente Powers and consents to expel all Germans from Uexico. (To secure the adherence of Carranza it will be necessary for the Entente to outbid Germany.)*r   (b) Definite repudiation of Carranza, followed or accompanied by his overthrow. The ilexican leaders should then be invited to select a President known to be persona grata to the three Allied Governments, and a definite guarantee should be given that he will be supported in every way provided his Government -act   in the interests of the Entente.The latter course is strongly recommended by the General Staff who attach the greatest importance to the avoidance of armed intervention by the United States as likely to affect both the transport to Europe of American troops and munitions and the supply of oil from Uexico.   At the same time pelaez cannot he expected to undertake the overthrow of Carranza without adequate assistance in arms, ammunition and money, and his requirements should be supplied under mutual arrangement by the three Powers chiefly concerned.It is felt that prompt action has &quot;been delayed to a -^reat extent by the policy both of h.II. G. and- the &quot;do so a. in consulting vested interests at every turn.   The problem should be regarded primarily from the point of view &quot;cf war and not of finance.   To prevent the contingency of Carranza ocizing or wrecking the oilfields and thus-prejudicing naval end military operations, a prompt decision to supply the ant i-* Carranza leaders with moral, material and financial support is essential.0    ^:t* AM4tt
