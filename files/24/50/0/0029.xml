Uhis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government] 35^^ALLj^^ Printed for the War Cabinet.  Aprili 1918.SECRET.NAJfAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION No. 49. Week ended 21th April, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.On 25th April one of our large America seaplanes on patrol from Felixstowe was North Sea. attacked by seven enemy machines off North Hinder and shot down.  The crew of two officers and two men were lost.Minelaying operations in the Heligoland Bight have been continued.During the night of 22nd-23rd April operations were carried out against the enemy Mandera bases at Zeebrugge and Ostend, with the object of blocking the narrow entrances by means area, of block-ships.Six obsolete cruisers (&quot; Brilliant,&quot; &quot; Sirius,&quot; &quot; Intrepid,&quot; &quot; Iphigenia,&quot; &quot; Thetis &quot; and &quot; Vindictive &quot;), two old submarines (C.1 and C.3) and two auxiliaries (&quot; Iris &quot; and &quot; Daffodil &quot;) took part in the attack. The first five of the cruisers mentioned were filled with concrete, and were intended to be sunk in the channels and entrances to the ports.There were fight covering forces belonging to the Dover Command and Harwich Forces; a force of&apos; monitors, motor launches and coastal motor boats also took part in the operation, and French destroyers co-operated. Aerial bombardment was not possible owing to the weather, and the attack was. made under cover of a smoke screen.The general plan of operation against Zeebrugge was for &quot; Vindictive,&quot; with the auxiliaries &quot; Iris &quot; and &quot; Daffodil,&quot; after an hour of intense bombardment by the monitors, to run alongside the head of the Mole, attacking with gunfire as they approached, and to land storming and demolition parties. Meantime, three block-ships, assisted by the coastal motor boats and launches, were to make for the entrance to the canal, run aground, and be blown up. The two old submarines were to run against the pile work connecting the masonry portion of the Mole with the shore, and, being filled with explosives, were to be blown up, thus destroying the pile-work connection.The results of the operations at Zeebrugge were as follows : The block-ships &quot; Intrepid &quot; and &quot; Iphigenia &quot;, were sunk and blown up in the entrance of the canal, the &quot; Intrepid &quot; with bows to the east, stern to the west, at an angle of about 450 to the transverse of the canal, the line of the shore at high water mark cutting her amidships ; the &quot; Iphigenia &quot; with bows to the east, stern to the west, at an angle of about 60o to the transverse of the canal, her stern being just at the fine of the shore high water mark. The crews were taken off by Motor Launch 282. The third block-ship &quot; Thetis &quot; was received with heavy fire and grounded just outside the harbour, her crew being taken off by a motor launch. A certain amount of damage was done by gunfire and by torpedo attack on enemy destroyers and other craft lying alongside the Mole, and a coastal motor boat reports having torpedoed an enemy destroyer.. The(0 1126)  Wt.     55  5/18  H &amp; S
submarine (C.3) succeeded in attaining its objective, and was blown up, destroying the piling of the approach to the Mole, and making a clear break of 20 yards. The remaining submarine (C.1) failed to obtain the intended position and returned. Storming and demolition parties from &quot; Vindictive,&quot; &quot; Iris &quot; and &quot; Daffodil &quot; attacked under extremely heavy fire from destroyers alongside the Mole, but nevertheless inflicted considerable damage. The three vessels &quot; Vindictive,&quot; &quot; Iris &quot; and &quot; Daffodil,&quot; after maintaining their position alongside the Mole for over an hour, re-embarked their landing parties and withdrew. This attack successfully accomplished its main object of engaging the attention of the garrison on the Mole, thereby allowing the block-ships to enter the harbour.The plan of operation at Ostend was for two of the block-ships to be run aground and be blown up at the entrance to the port.The result of this operation was as follows : The coastal motor boats lit the approaches and the ends of the piers with calcium flares, and made a smoke cloud which effectually hid the illumination from the enemy. The block-ships &quot; Sirius &quot; and &quot; Brilliant &quot; were already past the Stream Bank buoy when suddenly the wind changed, revealing the arrangements to the enemy, who extinguished the flares with gunfire. The &quot; Sirius &quot; was now in a sinking condition, and at length the two ships, having failed to find the entrance to the port, grounded and were forced to sink themselves about 400 yards east of the piers. Their crews were taken off by motor launches.Our total casualties in both operations, which were heavy in proportion to the numbers engaged, were as follows : 		Died of				Killed.	Wounds.	Missing.

A. Dover is received.R.A.F. machines from Dunkirk, employed on naval duty, have carried out a number of patrols and reconnaissances.On 21st April one enemy machine was brought down and one kite balloon forced to descend. On the same day five enemy aircraft were engaged six miles north of Ostend, without decisive result.On 22nd April sixteen 230-lb. bombs were dropped on Westende and on hostile shipping.   One of our machines is missing.On 23rd April bomb attacks were made on Zeebrugge, nearly two tons of bombs being dropped ; 150 rounds were also fired into four enemy destroyers three miles off Ostend. On the same day three of our machines were attacked by six enemy machines, with the result that one enemy machine was shot down.On 25th April our machines dropped about 1,900 lb. of bombs on Zeebrugge Mole, one bomb falling in or near the submarine shelter.On 27th April bombs were dropped on the aircraft stores depot at Lisseweghe, on the langar at Houttave, on a shed at Uytkerke, and also at Ostend, and six 230-lb. bombs were dropped on a battery west of Westende.
ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week under review 15 large enemy submarines have been located, four Submarines being vessels of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type. Of these latter, two were to the west operating, of Ireland (one homeward and the other outward bound), and two were on the 25th April of! Cape Blanco. The remaining large boats were distributed to the westward of the British Isles and in the Irish Sea. A report was also received during the week of a submarine being off Tromso, in the north of Norway. The week has been marked by an unusually large number of engagements with enemy submarines, and a considerable measure of success has been achieved.The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Home Actions Waters during recent weeks, and. the nature of the craft which have been engaged, and w^ enemy also the number of submarines destroyed :  submarines.

Submarines possibly sunk are not included.In addition to the foregoing, an attack on the 26th April by an Italian destroyer in the Straits of Otranto is reported, in which a towed sweep exploded on contact with a submarine. Air bubbles and wreckage came to the surface and the Italians consider that the submarine was destroyed.(C 1126) A 2On 22nd April five Austrian destroyers were engaged by our destroyers &quot; Jackal&quot; Medi-and &quot; Hornet,&quot; 12 miles N.E. from Cape Otranto.   The enemy retreated to Durazzo terranean&apos; pursued by our destroyers, who had been reinforced by five British and one French destroyer. The chase was continued until 12.30 a.in. on 23rd April., when touch with the enemy was lost.&quot; Jackal &quot; and &quot; Hornet &quot; were hit and slightly damaged, our casualties being 7 killed and 19 wounded, but it is not known what damage was sustained by the enemy.On 23rd April five of our aeroplanes from Otranto carried out a raid on Durazzo. Merchant ships and the seaplane base were attacked, nearly a ton of bombs being dropped with apparently successful results, and all our machines returned safely. The only man-of-war seen in the harbour was a gunboat.On 25th April the sloop &quot; Cowslip &quot; was torpedoed and sunk about 10 miles N.E. Casualties, from Cape Spartel, the casualties being 5 officers and 1 man.On the same day &quot; T.B. 90,&quot; while on patrol in the Straits of Gibraltar, capsized and sank three miles west of Carnero Point, the casualties being 1 officer and 12 men.

The Greek losses also are relatively very high in proportion to her total merchant tonnage. .ENEMY MINES.During the week under review the [enemy has continued his minelaying activity Minelayingi in the area eastward of Montrose, and has also laid mines off the south-east coast of England and in the Falmouth area. No less than 49 mines have been destroyed during the week in the Montrose area, where it is believed that at least 72 mines have been laid. It is thought probable that this minefield will be added to from time to time until the area covered reaches limits at which it would commence to interfere with the passage of submarines to and from their bases. The enemy are employing for this work large sub-marines, each carrying 36 mines.The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels Casualties, sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks : Week Ended.

MOVEMENTS OF ENEMY SHIPS.During the week only nine enemy merchant ships arrived at, and nine sailed from, Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat.   No enemy ships have entered or left Rotterdam.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.Captain F. N. A. Cromie, R.N., is at present organising the evacuation of material from Petrograd eastwards, by river, as the railways are now disorganised, and lie will leave for Moscow as soon as this task is completed. It was intended that he and Engineer-Commander Le Page should proceed at once to Sevastopol, to assist in reorganising the Black Sea Fleet, but at present communication with the Crimea is reported to be interrupted. The latter, however, is to make an attempt to reach Sevastopol as soon as he has been able to interview M. Trotskv.With reference to the statement in last week&apos;s Appreciation, that the enemy were concentrating their naval units at Odessa, the Turkish cruiser &quot; Hamadieh &quot; and one destroyer have now returned to Constantinople.The German submarines in the Black Sea have been ordered to sink any Russian warships entering or leaving Sevastopol.Naval Staff,2nd May, 1918.Appendices.
