(THIS POOUI/iBHT lb THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC UaJEoTY^ GQVEBNIENT),SECRET.,&apos; war     0 A 3 I g E T,PROPOSED BRITISH MISSION TO JAPAN.Note by lir. Balfour, covering correspondence between EimscIf^aiid &quot;Sord Be avert) rook; vith notes&quot; &quot;by Lfcmbors of the War CaDinet.I,Note for the War Cabinet by Mr. Balfour.I circulate correspondence which has passed between Lord Bcaverbrook and myself on this subject, which places mo in some difficulty.     I succeeded in obtaining the sorvices of Irince Arthur of Connaught, and the Mng has consented to allow him to head the Llission to convey the Field Ivjarshai^ Baton to the Smperor of Japan.     I also succeeded in inducing the Japanese to accept tho idea of a civilian side to the llission, with a distinguished statesman at its head, I tried to get lord Salisbury to acoept the place, but for various reasons ho declined,     I could think of nobody to replace him.     Lord Beaverbrook suggests Lord Berosford, but Lord Bcrosford is not a civilian but a sailor, and a sailor who, from the nature of tho case, has had no experience of naval operations during the course of the present war.     This is an important point.     The Japanese particularly desired that one of the soldiers attached to the Military Mission should be a General having experience of warfare in France, and their wishes have been complied with.   Lord Beresfcrd can hardly bo deemed either a representative statesman or, from tho Japanese point of view, a reprosenta-tive sailor.     Moreover, Lord Derby earnestly expressed the hope that no sailor would be sent on this Mission. He objected particularly to Lord Boresford on this very ground, and certainly it would be contrary to all precedent that a Mission, the sole definite object of which is to confer a Field Marshall Baton, should have among its members a sailor.In these circumstances, I take tho vievj that the Mission should be confined within small proportions, and should have a military side only.Let mo add that I have never been traite clear as to tho exact character of tho propaganda work which tho civilian side of this Alusion, as suggested by Lord Boavcrbrook, was intended to carry out.(Initialled).

BNGI^OSim.! TO, I. (A)COPY OF LETTER FROM ICRe BALFOT7R TO LORD BEAVERBROOK^-FOREIGN OFFICE, LONDON, S-.WJU-Monday, 22   APRIL, 1918.priyaft e.My dear Lord Beaterbrook,Our South A&amp;feivtcan Mission is now, I hope, safely on it* way;   hut our Mission to Japan remains still unsettled.The military Bide of it leaves nothing to be desired. Prince Arthur of Connaught is at its head,  and there is an excellent representative of the fighting soldier in General Pulteney.     It is the civilian side that is still in debate.After a good deal of hesitation, I have now come to the conclusion that we ought not to have a civilian side at all I Precedent is against it, and though precedent would not move me if it appeared t&amp;at anything was to be obtained by^ breaking it, I am on the whole disposed to think that we should lose rather than gain by attempting the unusual combination.This conclusion is partly due to the result of my correspondence with Salisbury.    I asked him whether he would undertake the job, and he answered (in effect) that he would be willing to do so if the-Government were prepared to entrust him with negotiations of importance, but that, if he was to be merely a figurehead, he thought that he would be more use at home.Now I oan think of nobody else of Salisbury53 distinction whom we cnuld invite with any chance of success, and if there were anybody he would almost certainly give the same answer as Salisbury has given,       I am not prepared to entrust/any member of the Mission the duty of carrying on negotiations with the Japanese Government.    It is not that there are no questions of importance pending between London and Tokio:   the very reverse is the case.   But I do not wish to discuss these during the war.   Some of them are very thorny: none are likely to be negotiated without controversy: it is clearly wise to keep them for ihe present in the background.The position therefore appears to be this:   If we add a civilian element to the military Mission, we mUst secure the services of an eminent civilian.   Eminent civilians are not easy to find, and, if we found one, it would probably be only en condition that he was entrusted with some definite work of importance,  and I have no definite work fo give him.   If this difficulty were got over,  and our eminent civilian reached Japan, it is practically certain that; whatever we said in London, the statesmen at Tokio would expect him to discuss with them, formally or informally, some of the pending subjects of controversy between the two Governments: and, as I sm unwilling that this course should be adopted, it&apos; appears to me that our only plan is to revert to the original proposal, and to keep the Mission on a purely military footing.If you do not concur in this view, we might perhaps find an early opportunity of talking the matter over together, but I much hope for your agreement.Yours sincerely,I!r/^t-Vailed) A.J.B...
Copy^ef letter from lord Beaverbrook to Mr. Balfour.Ministry of Information, Norfolk Street, Strand,LOKDON, W.C. 2.26th April, 1918.PRIVATEDear Mr. Balfour,I have to thank you for your letter of the 22nd April on the subject of the Japanese Mission,  in which you say that you hare now come to the conclusion that there ought not to be a civilian side at all.I would point out that this question was settled by the far Cabinet (366, par, 10) on March 18th, in the sense that there should be a civilian side to the Mission, and that in that Minute and in 377, par. 12, I was asked to prepare a list of names of the subordinate civilian officials to go with the Mission. I find myself quite unable to agree to a reversal of the decision of the War Cabinet, and I would submit most respectfully that neither you nor I have the power to reverse that decision, which stands unless the War Cabinet determines otherwise, which it has net done.Further, I would ask you to consider the extremely awkward position in which I am placed by your letter with regard to those gentlemen I have asked to form part of the civilian side cf the Mission.   They have made all their arrangements prepara-tory to starting and I am committed to them.   It is impossible for me to tell them that the foreign office has reversed a decision of the War Cabinet instructing me to obtain their services.Thirdly,  there is the question of the distinguished Peer who was to be the head of the civilian side of the Mission, you will remember that, while the War Cabinet was to decide this appointment, it was left open to you or me to make suggestions. You proposed Lord Salisbury, and I suggested Lord Beresfora. Lord Salisbury, as I rather expected, has finally decided not to go. 1 heard from Lord Beresford that he would accept in case the offer was made to him.   Lord Beresford has written to me that he is prepared to go, and he makes none of the conditions which led to Lord Salisbury is refusal.   Before speaking with Lord Beresford I mentioned his name to two members of the War Cabinet.   What am 1 to aay to him ?I have considered carefully the reasons Lord Salisbury gave you for refusing, but will you forgive me for saying that those reasons raise a question which was already completely settled between us to your satisfaction ?   I absolutely concurred, and concur, in your view that the civilian branch should not have a special diplomatic mission, and that that task had far better be left to the ordinary machinery of the Foreign Office.   Lord Salisbury does not agree with either of us in this point and therefore does not desire to go.Lord Beresford does agree with us on this point and is willing to go.   Surely he, or some other well-known Peer, is not to be stopped from accepting, and the whole civilian side of the Mission agreed on by the War Cabinet, abolished, because Lcrd Salisbury thinks that under the circumstances he himself can do better work in England ?
My opinion, therefore, is that the civilian side of the Mission should he sent as the War Cabinet agreed, and with the limited objects suggested by the Foreign Office and accepted by the Ministry rf Information, and that Lord Beresford should be asked to act as the head of this branaa.Yours faithfully,(Sgd.)   BEAVERBROOK.The Rt. Hon. A. J. Balfour, M,P F0R3IGF OFFICE.
Ijote by Lord Curgon.I should like to s.ay that I concur with Mr.Balfcrur.    I certainly never accepted a civilian side of the Hission conte que conte.    My assent was given on the condition that a states-man of the calibre of Lord Crowe (whom I suggested) or Lord Salisbury, should be willing to go as its head.     But as soon as it became apparent that such a Mission would be expected by the Japanese and cone dona ferentos, I personally abandoned the Idea of a civilian side&quot;of the Mission.     Hor do I think that Lord Ber&amp;GScvrd     would adequately represent the Government on that 3ide.     I do not know whom Lord Beaverbrook has chosen to do the propaganda work, or to shine as minor stars in the civilian galaxy.     But I doubt the desirability of the Mission undertaking Jany   such work at all, and no invitation already extended to such gentlemen ought to be allowed to override the public interest, which I interpret   in the same sense as the Foreign Secretary.(Intd.) 0. of K.30th April. 1918(ii).Hote by Mr,Chamberlain.I feel a real difficulty in commenting on these papers, as I was not a member of the Cabinet when the original decision was taken, and the papers submitted herewith leave   me in doubt whether I have the whole facts before me.     I should not, for instance, have understood from the Cabinet Minute*that the &apos;-*&apos;r&apos; Minister of Information was authorized to offer the headship fri*V,/0. Q  the Mission on the civil side to e-nyone.    If he was so authorized, I think it was a mistake.     Such an appointment ought only to bo made on tho advice of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Again, I read (c) as an invitation to submit names - not to make or offer appointments.     Compere (e).Bo this as it may, I think the circumstances as here disolosed make it inexpedient to send any Civilian Mission. (I must,however, note that I have not seen the Ambassador&apos;s reply to the question at (d)).In any case I em bound to say thi.it I do not think that Lord Beresford is the right man for a position which must necessarily be one of extreme diplomatic delicacy;   and to send a civilian Mission against the advice of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and to choose for its head a man in whom he has not implicit confidence for this purpose would appear to me a double blunder *, I agree, therefore, with the conclusions of Lord Curzon*       and Mr.Bai.four.(Intd.)

(iv)goto by tir.Barnes.On the whole I agree with Mr-Balfour that, if there is no-one *.rho has his entire confidence and to \fiom he can confide in regard to the outstanding questions between our-solves and Japan, the civilian side of the Japanese Mission might as pell be dropped.    I was favourably inclined to the idea-, having regard to what I had soon in the telegrams, but it is a very delicate business and I am guided in regard to it by the Foreign Secretary.(Intda) G.H.B.1st Hay. 1918.E, vftiitehall Gardens, 3*;h 2nd jfe,v.I918.Hate by General Smuts.&apos;The tacking on of a utility serrlse like propaganda * to a honorifio Mission such ss that of  Trioic^-Arttor X. consider undigrJ fled and wrong in policy;   and on that gr-ouM I have from the first, agreed with&quot;the Secretary of State for War that there should be no political side to the Mission.(mta*) J.C.S,1st May, 1918
