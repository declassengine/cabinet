WAR CABINET. PRIORITY   SERVICES. (Note by General Smuts.)The inclusion of Mr. Austen Chamberlain in the War Cabinet makes it possible to carry out a grouping together of the various priority services the desirability of which has long been felt.At present there are. as far as I know, the following priority services:1.   The American Inter-Allied Board,Allied supplies and financial requirements in the United states of America in respect of which priorities as between the Allies are settled by the Inter-Allied American Board, and as between our Departments by the American Board, of which Mr. Chamberlain is Chairman, tfnile he is our principal^meTnbeTTl^ Board.2.   The Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement.&quot;       liii inn-i m      im--i-i in 111&apos;nj.nmniirin i &quot;  iqi iliu i in    r--uriini   hi       i......ii        ii imdoi iwm n......mmSupplies te the smaller Allies purchased in Great Britain; priorities for ??hieh are generally settled by the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement, under Sir E* %Idbore Smith.   This service works under the Board of Trade or the &quot;Foreign Office, and is close eo-cperation with (3) following.3.   The War priorities Committee sf the Cabinet - consisting *      under&apos;&apos;^,,53Kr3TOn^&apos;3^^*o^1&apos; ihe First Lord, the Secre-taries oF&apos;&quot;&apos;staTe for War and Air, the Ministers of Munitions and National service, with other Ministers attending ?shen their Departments are concerned.This Committee works through a permanent Sub-Committee and a large number of Allocation Committees, and settles priorities and allocates supplies and material not only to the various War Services but also to the civilian departments.There are also some smaller Consijittees controlling Amerioan military purchases in this country or supplies to the British Dominions and Colonies.At certain points the activities of the Blockade Department, the Shipping Department and the Joint KS-val Board s.l3o touch the above priority services.The above services are closely related, and tend more and more to affect each other, and decisions in respect of one of them have to be made in full knowledge cf their effects on other priority services.   We have here clearly a oase ef a large group of related services which should work under the super-vision of one member of the War Cabinet, and I would suggest *SECRET. G.T. 4416,
(after I have discussed the matter with him) that J r. Austen Chamberlain be deputed for the purpose, and that authority to act for the Cabihot be given him in all matters, except such ae involve large questions of polioy on which departments cannot be made to agree, which, should continue to comb on appeal before the ^Tar Cabinet.(Initialled)   J.C.S.2f Whitehall Gardens*, S.tf. 2nd Kay, 1913, &apos;
