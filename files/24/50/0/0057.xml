coast Watchers in Ireland.r  ----&quot;----------Admiralty Memorandum for the War CaCabinet.As desired by War Cabinet 397, Minute 6 (b),&quot;A&apos;::V *&quot; a;.       -enquiries have been made with reference to the reliability which can be-attached to Coast Watchers in Ireland, and the following information has been received from the Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Ireland,Is regards the Northern District, it is reported that the Civilian Coast Watchers can at present be depended upon to carry out their coast watching duties in an honest and efficient manner but that in the event of any serious trouble arising they could not be relied upon, excepting a few who are naval and military pensioners and the men in the Counties of Antrim and Down,    Although there are at present no grounds for supposing any of the civilian coast watchers to be associated with the Sinn Fein organisation, they are likely^in the event of a sudden increase of the movement, to be dragged into it either by personal sympathy, intimidation, anti-conscription ideas or the attitude of the Roman Catholic Clergy,As regards the Southern District, it appears that so far as the Enemy and Enemy submarines are concerned the -civilian coast watchers can be thoroughly relied upon and can be trusted to keep a strict and regular watch, but that very little reliability can be placed in them to inform against their own Countrymen or to prevent steps which may be taken in the interests of the Sinn Fein movement.(Signed)   ERIC GEDDES.6/5/18,
