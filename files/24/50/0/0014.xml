THE CZECHO-SLOVAK MOVEMENT.

Notes on conversation with Representatives of the Bohemian National Council at Versailles on 22nd April, 1918.

Mr. Stead brought over Dr. Benish who is the Head of the Bohemian United Council in Paris. He stated that Masaryk was the Head of the Bohemian Movement amongst the Czecho-Slovak prisoners of war in Russia, that Dr. Benish was the Head of the organisation in France and Col. Stephenik of a similar movement in Italy. Dr. Benish and Col. Stephenik can be found by letters addressed to 18, Rue Bonaparte, Paris.

Dr. Bonish stated that the Czecho-Slovaks were stirring up agitation in Austria-Hungary but that he could not look for any Revolution under conditions as they are at present. If the German offensive were to succeed the whole of the Revolutionaries would be wiped out by similar methods to those employed by the Turks against the Armenians. It is impossible therefore for the Bohemians to undertake any big revolutionary movement until the control of Austria-Hungary was weaker than it is at present. Of the 52 millions of people of which Austria-Hungary is composed 32 millions are active or passive friends of the Allies. These friends are capable of making the political and economic situation in Austria-Hungary more difficult and are continuing to do so to an increasing extent. It is only because the wobbling policy of the Allies in titivating for peace with Austria and in supporting the Austrian Empire has made their position uncertain that they have not been able to do more. On the other hand they are sufficiently strong to stop the Austro-Hungarian Government from trying to take active measures of repression. The political situation therefore is that neither side can undertake any great movement at present. As regards economics, May to August will be the critical period and the Bohemians have every intention of taking advantage of it. Dr. Benish also stated that the strong anti-Semitic movement in Hungary was ? value to the Bohemians as there were over 100,000 ? in Hungary mostly of the small trader and provision merchant class. The Bohemians, the Yugo-Slavs and the Poles have made an agreement together and are acting in conjunction.

Dr. Benish and Mr. Stead both stated that the system of agents etc. was very well organised and very complete. A regular service was maintained between Switzerland and Bohemia, and any order given in Paris could get to Bohemia in about 2 days and from there be sent on to the troops at the front. The Austro-Hungarian Government was not sufficiently strong to repress the Czech newspapers who were now able to publish what they pleased.

Turning to the movement of the Czecho-Slovaks in countries outside Austria-Hungary, Dr. Benish and Mr. Stead dealt with it under four heads :-

???

Russia.

There are 45,000 Czecho-Slovaks at SAMARA and TAMBOV, West of the URALS, of whom a certain number are unarmed. There
There are 20,000 at TCHEklABI 2FSK just-East of the URALS&quot;. Six trains each talcing about 1, 000 men had left OMSK for the East on April 14th,   Two Regiments each of about 2,500 men had reached and were due to arrive atVLADIVOSTOCK or jQAL3Rjf about ^pril 24fch.   This gave a total of approximately 75.000 O^ocho -Slovaks in Russia and Siberia of whom about Co..000 are armed.   As soon as prisoners heard that the Czechs were in the neighbourhood they were leaving their prisoner camps and joining the Czechs.   The numbers therefore were likely to increase although possibly 75,000 might be considered a somewhat liberal estimate of the present numbers.The Czech Army in Russia had a distinctive uniform and fought very well in the Kerensky offensive of June, 1917.   Since the institution of the Bolshevist regime the Russian Officers under wh6m they had fought have been with-drawn and there are no Czech Officers above the rank of Captain.   They would however be quite willing to serve under French or British Officers ana are well disciplined, reliable and good fighters.   The Czechs were not prepared to take any part whatever in the conflicts raging between one section and another of the Russian nation by whom they had been fed, clothed and armed,  and were adamant on this point, but they would fight bitterly against anything that had a tinge of Germanism,   orders were sent to the Czechs in Russia from the French War office to General Lavergne who passed them on to the Czeeho-Slovak prisoners.   Both the French and British Governments had wobbled ae to whether the Caechs should be asked to continue fighting in Russia or whether they should be brought to one of the European battle fields and if so by which route they should travel.   It had originally been proposed that they should all go to VLADIV03T0.CK and thence via Canada and U.S.A. to  ranee and Italy.   At present the Czecho-Slovaks were living on the country and a3 there were engine-drivers and 6ther mechanics amongst them they commandeered trains and railway material and were transporting- themselves across Russia.Mr. Stead proposed, and Dr. Benish warmly supported him, that orders should be sent to the Czechs West of the URAL3, i.e. 45,000 men, to move North to ARCHANGEL and that the Allies should send food to meet them there and ships to bring thesi to Europe.   Any attempt by Finns or Germans to interfere with the Czechs at ARCHANGEL would be bitterly resisted.   Orders should be sent promptly as the prisoners are dribbling East every day.taly. The Italians had mixed up Germans, Magyars, Czechs, etc.in their Prisoner Camps and had put the whole under German I;&apos;.C.08.   The Czechs were now being put into Camps by them-selves and efforts were at last being made in regard to propaganda.   Already a situation had arisen in which the Austro-Hungarians dared not place Czech troop3 opposite the French and British on the Italian Front as the Czechs would at once desert wholesale to our side-   When the Austrians first captured Czech prisoners who were fighting on our side they were hanged.   The Czechs intimated that for every one of their men who was hanged they would hang 10 Austrians and 10 Magyars and every Officer. On the next occasion that a Czech was hanged by the Austrians the Czechs carried their threat into force and the Austrians have now given up the practice.   No offensive was likely to be undertaken in Italy unless Germany was victorious in this present battle and if our propaganda over the Austrian lines Y*as vigorously pursued during the next few weeks t,n offensive in Italy could be considered impossible. Several million leaflets were ready printed to be dropped by aeroplanes over the Austrian lines as soon as the weather
was suitable, and detachments of Czechs were conferrxng-an Ho Man&apos;s Land with Czechs now serving in the Austrian Army.   Time hmwwr^vaB ahcurt as the weather would probably permit of the enemy imumbAng an ofT-ensive by May 15th.French Front.The Austrian thrtt&amp;t to transfer large numbers of Austrian tirialone to the front in Prance was absurd.   The Austrians dared not send any but their most reliable troops since ae soon as they realised that the Allies would support their claim to independence any Czech troops would desert to our side within a fortnight.   It is only possible to send reliable Austrkn troops by taking them from Bohemia or from the other Austrian Fronts.   This could only be done if they were replaced by German troops of second quality. -The Emperor Charles realised that any mch occupation by German troops would turn Austria-Hungary Into a German Province and this he was not prepared to face.   The only way in which the Czechs could be got to support the Austro-Hungarian Government was if the Allies supported the K&amp;psburgs and caused the Czechs to think that we had thrown them over and were standing for a strong and united Austria.   Our policy should therefore be to do nothing to assist the Austrian Government but to assist by every means in our power the rebellious elements of the Monarchy who were either actively or passively &apos; friendly to the Allies.   In this connection any Czechs-Slovak troops who come to fight for the British, French or the Italians should be assured that they would be allowed to become British, French or Italian subjects if they so desire at the conclusion of the war,   If the victory of the Allies was not so complete that Austria^ Hungary Were crushed these individuals would have an alternative to that of returning to their own country, where they would be maltreated, or probably murdered.Balkans.A certain number of Czeoho-Slovaks are to be found in Albania and on ether parts of the Balkan Front,   The aame leaflets and methods which it is proposed to employ in Italy would also be suitable here but the effect would be considerably less, the Czecho-Slovak8 in this theatre of war being comparatively few in numbers4To sum up :-(l)The Franco-British Government a must settle on and declare a definite policy, that policy to be. the reoogni-tion without guarantees of the independence of any part of Austria which desires to set up independence and a statec.$ &amp; that the Hapaburg dynasty and the Austro-Hungarian Government has proved itself to be no b&amp;tter than the House of Hohenzollern and the Prussian Government and that both are an obstacle to the peace and general progress of the world.( ) That orders be sent immediatel^through General Lavergne that the Czeoho^SloVakT^eeTof the Urals should move to ARCHANGEL and that the British Government should take measures that food will be available for these prisoners at ARCKAKGSL on their arrival and will promise to send ships within a reasonable period to transport these prisoners to France for service against the Central Powers.
(Z) That tho Allies shell give the privilege of nationality to any Czecho-Slovaks who take up arias against the Central Powers, and(4) Tliat propaganda be actively pursued against the Austrian Government wherever Austrian troops are to be found.    If this is undertaken vigorously and at once, the greater part of the Austro-Hungarian Army will become so unreliable that not only will it not be able to undertake an offensive, but may become even unfitted to hold the line(Sgd.)
