POOLING OF SUPPLIES FOR THE ALLIES.

Copy of letter from General Pershing to the Prime Minister.

Note by the Secretary.

I append a copy of a letter dated April 28th addressed by General Pershing to the Prime Minister. I find that an almost identical letter was addressed by General Pershing to M. Clemenceau on April 9th. While at Abbeville the Prime Minister arranged with Monsieur Clemenceau, Signor Orlando, and General Pershing that a small Committee should be formed in Paris for the purpose of examining this question. The Secretary of State for War? has selected the Quarter-master-General to attend the Committee, which will meet at Paris on Monday, May 6th, 1918, at 3 p.m.

Omt Off XCTEH JfROM SEBBRAE JggRSHIffg S?0Headquarters American : ExpedltJjMoary JPoroos.Tho Prime Minister, April 28 th, 1918British Empire, London,Dear Mr* loyd George sBeferring to our recent conversation, permit mo to confirm my suggestion that all supplies and war materials that aro used in coramon by the allied armies be puolod and that the principle be extended, as far as possible, to the civil populations of the Allies.After many disappointments in efforts to secure co-ope ration and oo-or&amp;ination among the allied armies, we have finally come to recognise the absolute necessity   for the appointment of a Oommandsr^ in-Qhief of the Allied Armies in France, with full power to give all necessary directions for unity of military commandoSimilarly. the defects of present methods of handling supplies have long been recognised, but each of the allied armies continues to thinlc in terms of its ovm requirements independently of the other armiess     It is apparent that there are mani- classes of supplies used by all the allies which could be pooled and issued to &amp; partieu-lar army as required, but a practioal solution of the problem has not yet been reached.I consider this a matter of vital importance.    The nest three or four months are going&apos; to be difficult, and in order that combatant units and their necessary applies can be brought from tae United States every possible ton of shipping that can be saved by a semmmal system of allied should be made available.     3?he A,E.2?* has recently reduced or postponed its&apos;requirements in tonnage to the lowest limit to save sea-transportationt and even a casual study of the subject leads to the conclusion that our allies could also do considerably more than is now being &amp;one*While some attempt has been made through co-ordinating allied committees, including the Supreme&apos; War Council, these bodies are only advisory. &apos; A bird^-cye view of the whole problem is la citing and general authority to order the allotment and distribution of supplies to the different armies does not exist.     It is believed that this authority should be military.
classss of supplies ani fi3&amp;toi&amp;&amp;mon to all armies are many, &quot;but too much detail should not be undertaken.   The subject should be viov/ed broadly, The following classes of supplies, naturally, v;ould be inoluded: aviation materials, munitions as far as pos-&apos; siblo, horses, oats, hay, meat, flour, shoes, blankets, ooal, gasoline, v/agons, harness, motor transport, depots, warehouses, lumber and timber,     Suoh concentration or control of supplies would probably affect a saving in American rail and pert construction, as well as construo-tion of storage aeoommodationsBi.iay I also refer in this connection to the question of allied shipping ?    As you are no doubt aware, a very careful study shows that for the year 1918, there will be a deficit of 2,000,000 tons dead weight tonnage unless some of the programmes oan be reduced.     Obviously the mil-itary programme on the Y/estern Pront must be given firBt consideration and cannot bo reduced,,.    Actually it will be increased as American participation increases.It would scorn possible as recommended in substance by the Interallied Maritime Council.(1) That tho use of merchant tonnage by allied navies might be materially reduced by joint reeon-sidoration of naval programmes;(2) That considerable tonnage might be saved by suspending or reducing military activities in theatres of war other than the Western Front;(3)   That further reductions in civilian imports carefully considered by Inter-Allied criticism oan release additional tonnage*It would seem desirable that these two subjects of pooling supplies and shipping control should be under Inter-Allied Liilitary management and that one executive head be given control of both.     It is believed that a very great increase in efficiency will result from the centralised executive management suggested.I have already written M* Clemenoeau on the question of pooling supplies which he approves in principle.With highest personal and official regard.I amYours faithfully,(Signed), JOHN J. PERSHIifG.
