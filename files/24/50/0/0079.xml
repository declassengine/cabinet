2HT IS THE PROPERTY CF HIS BRITAMIG MJESTY!S GOVERN! 38PROVISION OF SMALL HOLDINGS BY COUNTY COUNCILS.;HT).Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.I desire very earnestly to impress upon tho WCabinet the important public considerations which arc raised by the issue prosontod in this Memorandum.   Tho County Councils Association has repeatedly pressed for facilities for acquiring land for small holdings and County Councils are at present unable to make any progress whatever either in the way of satisfying the demands of tested and suitably approved applicants or in preparing for returning soldiers0 Amongst the applicants, approved and otherwise, as time goes on there will be an increasing number of discharged soldiers, and this number will be large as soon as the Army is demobilised.   The Issue presented is therefore a very real test of Government good faith.   It is quite impossible for us to refer in public to our national obligations to these men, whilst, at the same time, we arc declining to give any facilities to responsible public authorities who are anxious to discharge their responsi-bllities in this matter and who feel them pressing the more heavily upon them in consequence of the nature and service of the applicants, and I desire to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the following considerations:for small holdings by County Councils has been entirely suspended through tho inability of the Treasury to sanction loans for these purposes.(1)andPurchase of land/adaptation and equipment of land
(2).        It Is one of the most serious responsibilities of the State, at the present time, that due provision should be made to meet the demand -for small holdings arising from discharged sailors and soldiers after the war,(3).        In addition to this, there is a considerable unsatisfled demand for small holdings already in existence and arising from:(a) persons who have been approved by Cimty Councils as suitable tenants of Small Holdings but for whom no land is available. It appears from the Annual Report of proceedings under the Small Holdings Acts for the year 1914,being the latest Report issued, that at the end of that yoar there were 6,432 applicants and 2 Associations approved as suitable for whom land had not been acquired and that 89^251 acres were required to satisfy them.(b) persons who have applied for Small Holdings but who have not yet been approved as suitable tenants, their application being held over&apos;In consequence of there being no prospect of land being available.(4) In these circumstances, County Councils are anxious tomake provisions to meet the existing and anticipated demand; and the fact that no further loans for that purpose ,can be made and that as far as Its known &apos;)no steps are being taken to enable the demand to be met, has beenlthe subject of unfavourable comment and serious complaint.   *(5) The Treasury having, in a letter to the Board of Agriculture&amp; Fisheries dated Jan. 5th 1910, Indicated their inability to provide money for the purchase of land the only method available for such purchase appears to be by the creation of an annual rent charge guaranteed by the State. A copy of the Treasury letter referred to is attachod.
\   &apos;It Is believed i^1^xa^-^n&amp;i&amp;etf&apos;elllJ6^^ could be purchased on a voluntary basis by the above method of payment by guaranteed.rent charge.County Councils have adequate powers of leasing land., Bvit while this method of providing land can be resorted to, many County Councils have hesitated to use it owing in part to tho onerous conditions attaching to loans for equipment and also because it has frequently been possible in the past to obtain land on more reasonable terms by purchase0But the cost cf adaptation and equipment, whether the land be acquired by purchase on payment by creation of a rent charge or whether It bo takon on lease, must be provided for and oan only be aa provided by loans to County Councils,I understand from the President cf the Board cf Agriculture and Fisheries, with whom I have been in consultation on &quot;the whole matter, that the Board t;&quot; are prepared to frame an instruction to County Councils, emphasizing the need for strict economy and pointing out that in future only the minimum outlay required for adaptation and equipment will be sanctioned,I, therefore, ask that authority should be givon^ to the Treasury:(a) to guarantee in proper cases rent charges created for the purchase of land, and(b) to make advances to County Councils of money (up to  1,000,,000) reasonably and properly expended upon the adaptation and equipment as Small Holdings of land either purchased in the manner Indicated or taken upon leaseaCHRIST0PH2B ADDISON, 7,5,18*
apfehddc.Sxspy of letter from ^reaswy to the Board of Agriculture.TREASHHX CHAMBERS, 5th January 1918.17Sir,to tords Coiamisaloners of Ms Majesty1 a llreasury have had before them your letter of the 23rd Ootober last (L/3669/1917) and previous correspondence on the subject of the provision of land for the purpose of small holdings both through County Councils aid In connection with Schemes for tho settlement of Soldiers and Sailors under the direct supervision of the State.-As the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries is aware the matter has recently been the subject&quot;of personal communication between $heir Lordships1 Financial Secretary and the President of the Board and X am now directed to place on reoerd the general oon-oXusiona arrived at. j(1) ttm provision of capital for these purposes from fforerc** ment fonds on any appreciable scale is likely to be impracticable both during the war and for some time after the conclusion of peace.Apart from the proceeds of loans raised for the purpose of financing war expenditure and the proceeds of current taxation, the only moneys at present available frop Government sources are the sargixs of repayment of loans dug to the Zoo&amp;l Loans Fund over-new loans from that fund.     this margin is of strictly limited amount and is largely trenched upon already in respect of demands for necessary sanitary services and housing in congested areas^Any new issue of 2.ocal loans Stock while war borrowing is stiiS going on or during the period of consolidation of the floating debt, which will become urgently necessary when peaco has been concluded, must be regarded as out of the question,(2) While the post-war value of land depends on many factors the resultant of which cannot be precisely foreseen, any large &apos; scheme of purchase by the State at competitive prices would, re-gard being had to the present upward trend of prices, be very ua-desirable at the present time as tending to encourage speculative enhancement of values, and might well in the long run prove to be wary Imprudent finance, .Uiese considerations, in ^aeir Lordships&apos;5 opinion, point to the conclusion that, if any large schemes are to be undertaken, the best, and indeed the only practicable, course of procedure is upon the lines not of capital grants of State loans, tout of the acquisition of the necessary land either&apos;outright in exchange for a permanent, rent charge based on its pre-war annual value or upon lease for a limited period with an option to the vendor to call; upon the State to purchase at the then market value upon the ex-piry of the lease, by which time it may be anticipated that a more stable standard of capital values will have been established
For Their own part, My Lords would he disposed to favour the latter rather than the former method.The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries will be in a bettor position than They are to judge what prospects there may be of making satisfactory arrangements with landowners upon euch lines on a voluntary basis, but even if these are unfavourable, it appears to My Lords to be well worth considering whether appli-cation should not be made to Parliament for compulsory powers * more particularly in connection with tho settlement of ex-soldicrs and sailors, whose special claims would rightly be held to justify exceptional methods.Apart from the question of acquiring land ad hoc for theso purposes * My Lords understand that the Board ofTAgrTculturo and Fisheries has under consideration proposals in relation to Tithe Rent Charge and Glebe Lands which if they mature may result in considerable areas of land passing into State owner-ship in exchange for rent charges of a kind which in most cases would not come into the market and which where the;- did come into the market would in ail probability not compete directly with other Government securities.   Much of this land it a-    would in all probability he emine.itly/for both *he purposes bis.   now under consideration.While not yet in a position to oxpress an opinion in regard to these proposals the details of which are not before Them,, at appears to My Lords very desirable, in view of tho difficul-tiles of financing acquisition of land by other methods, that the possibility of early progress in this direction should be explored with as little delay as possible.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) JOHN BRADBTIRx,The Secretary,Board of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries.
