Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1918.SSS^^eStial.[53848/W. 39.]This Interim Report of Sir Walter Phillimere&apos;s Committee is circulated to the War Cabinet for their consideration.&apos; It is suggested that a copy should be sent to President Wilson confidentially, so that if he thinks right he may have it considered by an American expert committee. Copies should, perhaps, also be sent to the Dominions in view of the approaching conference.THE COMMITTEE ON THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.The Right Hon. Sir Walter G. F. Phillimore, Bart, P.C. (Chairman).Professor A. F. Pollard, M.A.Sir Julian S. Corbett.Dr. J. Holland Rose, Litt,D.Sir Eyre Crowe, K.C.M.G.Sir William Tyrrell, K.C.M.G.Mr. C. J. B. Hurst, K.C., C.B.Mr. A. R, Kennedy (Secretary).1. We had the honour to be appointed by you as a Committee to enquire par-ticularly from a juridical and historical point of view into the various schemes for establishing by means of a League of Nations, or other device, some alternative to war as a means of settling international disputes, to report on their practicability, to suggest amendments,, or to elaborate a further scheme if on consideration it should be deemed possible and expedient, and to report to you the result of our deliberations.2. We have held nine meetings in which our attention has been directed mainly to the various proposals for a League of Nations which were formulated in the 16th and 17th centuries and to those which have been put forward since the recent revival of the movement.3. With regard to other methods of international combinations for avoiding war which were actually attempted during the 19th century, we have not completed our investigation, and without further inquiry into past political experience we would offer no opinion as to whether a modification of those methods or a formal League of Nations is the more promising means of securing the end in view.4. The earlier projects which aimed at setting up a kind of European Con-federation with a supernational authority we have after consideration, rejected, feeling that international opinion is not ripe for so drastic a pooling of sovereignty, and that the only feasible method of securing the object is by way of co-operation or possibly a treaty of alliance on the lines of the more recent schemes.ROBERT CECIL.INTERIM REPORT.To the Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, P.C., O.M., &amp;c, &amp;c. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.March 20, 1918.[436]B
5. We have accordingly carefully considered those schemes, all of which sub-stitute, in place of the earlier idea of confederation, a system working by means of a permanent conference and an arbitral tribunal. None of them, however, in their entirety appear to your Committee to be practicable or likely to meet with accept-ance. We have therefore drafted a Convention in which, while embodying their leading ideas, we have endeavoured to avoid their more obvious stumbling blocks.6., On the assumption that a League of Nations may be regarded as a possible solution of the problem, we now submit this draft as the best we have been able to devise, to serve as a basis for an interchange of views. In making it the subject of an Interim Report we have been influenced by the consideration that His Majesty&apos;s Government may regard it as desirable to initiate such an interchange of views before the termination of the war.7. The primary object of the proposed alliance will be that whatever happens peace shall be preserved between members of the alliance. The secondary object will be the provision of means for disposing of disputes which may arise between the mem-bers of the alliance. Our draft treaty, therefore, divides itself into four parts: Articles 1 and 2, which stand very much by themselves, are to provide for the avoidance of war; Articles 3 to 12, for the pacific settlement of international disputes; Articles 13 to 17, for the relations between the allied States and States not party to the Convention; while Article 18 provides that this treaty shall override all others.8. The mutual covenant not to go to war is contained in Article 1. We have not covered all cases. We have provided that no State shall go to war without previously submitting the matter to arbitration or to the Conference of the League, nor while the discussion is pending in debate, nor shall seek any further satisfaction than that which the award or the recommendation of the Conference requires. This leaves untouched the case in which the Conference can make no recommendation, but we are in great hope that this event will be rare. There will be every inducement to the Conference to find a mode of escaping from war, and, at any rate, the time will be so long drawn out that passions will have cooled. The other case omitted is when a State that has given cause of offence refuses to abide by the award or the recommendation of the Conference. It might be suggested that in this case the whole power of the League should be used to enforce submission, but we have felt a doubt whether States would contract to do this, and a still greater doubt whether, when the time came, they would fulfil their- contract. Most of the writers on this subject have hesitated to recommend such a provision.9. It will be noted that the proposed moratorium only extends to actual warfare. Some writers have suggested that there should be no warlike preparations during the period.  We have rejected this (a.) because it would be difficult to ascertain what were special warlike preparations;(&amp;.) because we would designedly give an opportunity to the most peaceful State which had not kept its armaments up to a high pitch to improve them during the period of the moratorium, in this way discounting to some extent the advantages which a State which kept up excessive armaments wDuld otherwise have had.&apos; 10. Article 2 contains the sanction proposed. We have desired to make it as weighty as possible. We have, therefore, made it unanimous and automatic, and one to which each State must contribute its force without waiting for the others, but we have recognised that some States may not be able to make, at any rate in certain cases, an effective contribution of military or naval force. We have accordingly provided that such States shall at the least take the financial, economic, and other measures indicated in the Article.11. Article 3 is adapted from Article 38 of The Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, 1907.12. Article 4 expands an idea, the germ of which appears in Article 48 of the same Convention; it gives the power to a State to apply ex parts to the Conference of the Allied States.  Reference to arbitration requires the consent   of both
jparties, but this provision will enable any one State, party to the dispute, to bring its case before the Conference even if the other State is not willing. We have been careful to remember that there will be much jealousy, particularly among the continental Powers of Europe, of any provision which will appear to infringe their independence or sovereignty^ and therefore we u not give the Conference, thus appealed to, any power of adjudication, but only one of recommendation.13. Article 5. It is in our view desirable that if the Conference be appealed to it shall not fail to act, and, as in cases which will come under Article 12 speedy action would be required, we have made the assembly of the Conference as it were automatic&apos; It must be a matter for diplomatic determination to settle its seat. If the League should be in the first place confined to the present Allies, a convenient seat might be Versailles. If the League should embrace a number of States, and some of those at present neutral, it might be better to place the seat in Holland or Switzerland, or possibly in Belgium; but it should be a fixed place, and in this connection we have been much impressed by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s memorandum and address to us, in which he pointed out the great advantage arising from constant mutual intercourse between the representatives of nations, and we therefore propose that, subject to the power of substitution or addition, the ordinary diplomatic representatives at the capital which is the seat of the Conference should represent their respective States.14. The next questions which enter into consideration in Articles 7, 10, 11, and 12 are whether the decisions of the Conference must be unanimous, and whether, if any resolutions may be passed by a majority, the voting strength of the States should differ. We have concluded to eliminate the States parties to the dispute, but the precedents in favour of unanimity are so invariable that we have not seen our way to give power to a majority, or even a preponderant majority, to issue a definite recommendation, though we are aware that many English writers express theni-selves in a contrary sense. On the other hand, we have felt that for all preliminary work the vote of a majority should be sufficient. We may add that we have been rather loath to frame a scheme under which our own country should be rendered liable to have a recommendation passed against it by a majority vote in a matter vitally affecting the national interests, and that we Lave also felt that if some of the enemy Powers are ever to come into this League they would equally be unwilling to submit themselves to such a liability. As to the question of the voting strength in cases where a majority is to determine, most English and American writers have contemplated giving a larger vote to the more important Powers, and there are precedents, such as the General Postal Union Treaty of 1878 and the Telegraphic-Convention of 1897, for giving to those Powers which have important colonial possessions additional votes in respect of their colonies; but the experience obtained during The Hague Conference of 1907 shows that any such superiority would be greatly resented by some States, and we have shrunk from providing it.15. Article 11, as it will be seen, is expressed in an alternative form. The first alternative is that which commended itself to the majority of the Committee.16. Article 12 is a substitutional provision for that power of injunction which has been recommended by many English and American writers. It has been felt that if there is to be a moratorium, there may be cases of continuing or irreparable injury to which the injured State cannot be &quot;expected to submit, in order to meet this difficulty these writers have taken an idea from the legal procedure common to Great Britain and the United States. But in applying&apos; this procedure to inter-national matters the following objections seem to arise: (a.) If final awards or recommendations are not to be the subject of en force-men t by the League, it would seem illogical that interlocutory awards or recommendations should be so enforced;(6.) The aggressive State would certainly resent such an infringement of its sovereignty and struggle to prevent the use of an injunction, and the proceeding would almost necessarily be so prolonged, particularly if the injunction is to be the work of the whole Conference, that the inter-locutory decision would hardly be reached sooner than the final one, and the mischief would have been done;
(c.) It may be added that such knowledge as any of the members of the Com-mittee have of such foreign jurisprudence as is founded on the Code de Napoleon, leads them to doubt whether the procedure which most &apos; nearly approaches to the Anglo-American injunction has received the same development or occupies the same position of importance which it has with us.17. The Committee have, therefore, rejected the idea of injunction, and submit this Article as a corrective for hardship which might otherwise be worked by the moratorium.18. Article 15 requires some observation. The scheme of the British League of Nations Society makes the League a defensive alliance as against external Powers, and requires all the other Allied States to come to the assistance of any one of them &quot; which may be attacked by an outside Power which refuses to submit the case to an appropriate tribunal or council&apos;&apos;; but the American League to Enforce Peace has omitted this provision, and only one known American speaker or writer has taken the line of the British League. We have felt, therefore, that our draft treaty might provoke opposition if we inserted a clause obliging the Allies to mutual defence against external Powers, and. we have substituted one which is facultative only.19. Under Article 17 we might draw attention to the suggestion that when the League is once formed any future applicant for admission may have terms imposed upon him. This would enable the League to require reparation for past outrages, or to insist upon partial disarmament if the military or naval forces of the applicant were disproportionate to those of the States already in the League.(Signed)WALTER G.

Article 1.EACH of the Allied States (being the parties to this Convention) agrees with the other Allied States collectively and separately that it will not go to war with another of the Allied States (a.) without previously submitting the matter in dispute to arbitration or to aConference of the Allied States; and (b.) until there has been an award or a report by the Conference, provided that in the case mentioned in Article 12 the observance of this sub-clause is suspended;and also that it will not go to war -(c.) with, another of the Allied States which complies with the award or with the recommendation (if any) made by the Conference in its report.
&apos;4 c ftib Article 2.If, which may God avert, one of the Allied States should break the covenant contained in the preceding Article, this State will become ipso facto at war with all the other Allied States, and the latter agree to take and to support each other in taking jointly and severally all such measures military, naval, financial, and economic as will best avail for restraining the breach of covenant. Such financial and economic measures shall include severance of all relations of trade and finance with the subjects of the covenant-breaking State, prohibition against the subjects of the Allied States entering into any relations with the subjects of the covenant-break-ing State, and the prevention, so far as possible, of the subjects of the covenant-breaking State from having any commercial or financial intercourse with the subjects of any other State, whether party to this Convention or not.For the purpose of this Article, the Allied States shall detain any ship or goods belonging to any of the subjects of the covenant-breaking State or coming from or destined for any person residing in the territory of such State, and shall take any other similar steps which shall be necessary for the same purpose.Such of the Allied States (if any) as cannot make an effective contribution of military or naval force shall at the least take the other measures indicated in this Article.Pacific Settlement of International Disputes. Article 3.If a dispute should hereafter arise between any of the Allied States as to the interpretation of a treaty, as to any question of international law, as to the existence of any fact which if established would constitute a breach of any international obligation, or as to the nature and extent of the reparation to be made for any such breach, if such dispute cannot be settled by negotiation, arbitration is recognised by the Allied States as the most effective and at the same time the most equitable means of settling the dispute.Article 4.But if the Allied States concerned do not agree that the dispute is suitable for reference to arbitration, or do not agree as to the question to be referred or as to the composition of the tribunal of arbitration, or if for any other reason a reference to arbitration should prove impracticable, any one of the Allied States concerned may make application to the Conference of the Allied States to take the matter of the dispute into consideration.Article 5.it .The seat of the Conference shall be at X, the convener shall be the Sovereign or, President of the State of X, and his representative shall be president of the Confer-ence. The Allied States shall be represented at the Conference by their diplomatic representatives accredited to the State of X. In the event of X being one of the States parties to the dispute, either State may communicate with the Sovereign or President of Y, who thereupon shall become the convener and shall fix the seat of the Conference and name its president.The provisions of this Article shall not prejudice the right of any of the Allied States to send other representatives to the Conference, but the Conference shall be under no obligation to await their arrival.Article 6.It shall be the duty of the convener of the Conference to give notice of the appli-cation to the Conference to every State party to the dispute and to summon the Conference as speedily as possible.Article 7.The Conference shall regulate its own procedure, and may appoint Committees to enquire and report. In all matters covered by this Article the Conference may decide by the votes of a majority of the Allied States represented.[436] C
Article 8.The function of the Conference shall be to ascertain the facts with regard to the dispute, and to make a recommendation based on the merits of the case, and calcu-lated to ensure a just and lasting settlement.&apos; The recommendation shall not have the force of a decision.Article 9.The Allied States agree to place at the disposal of the Conference, or of any Committee appointed by the Conference, to the fullest possible extent compatible with their interests, the information in their possession which bears upon the dispute.Article 10.The recommendation of the Conference shall be addressed to the parties to the dispute, and will not require their assent.Article 11.In the event of the Conference being unable to agree upon a recommendation to be addressed to the parties to the dispute, it shall be the duty of the representatives of such of the Allied States attending the Conference as shall be satisfied as to the nature of the recommendation which should be made provided that they represent not less than a majoritjf of the Allied States attending the Conference to publish on behalf of the States which they represent a statement setting out what they believe to be the facts with regard to the dispute. The)&apos;&quot; may also add thereto the text of the recom-mendation which they consider the Conference should have addressed to the parties to the dispute.Alternative Article 11.If, in the event of the Conference being unable to agree upon a recommendation to be addressed to the parties to the dispute, any State or group of States having ta.ken part in the Conference issues a public statement of the view which, as a result of the deliberations of the Conference, it takes of the dispute, such action shall not be regarded as an unfriendly act by either of the parties to the dispute.Article 12.Any one of the Allied States having a dispute pending may apply to the Conf er--ence to be relieved from the moratorium imposed by Article 1 (b), on the ground that there is a continuing injury, or on the ground that unless some prompt provision for reparation or restitution is made the injury will be irreparable. The Conference shall, without deciding in any way upon the merits of the dispute, forthwith consider this application, and may relieve the applicant State from the provisions of the moratorium, or may suggest terms of temporary arrangement as a condition of not relieving the applicant State from the moratorium, and may from time to time recon-sider the application and the terms which should be imposed. In the event of relief from the provisions of the moratorium being granted under this Article, any of the Allied States may, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, come to the assistance of the State so relieved.Relations betiveen the Allied States and States not party to this Convention.Article 13.As regards disputes between one of the Allied States and a State not party to this Convention, the Allied State shall endeavour to obtain submission of the dispute to arbitration, if it be of a suitable nature for arbitration, and if the dispute be not of a nature suitable for arbitration, or if the other State will not agree to submit it to arbitration, the Allied State shall bring it before the Conference.    In the latter
event, the convener of the Conference shall, in the name of the League of Nations, invite the State not party to this Convention to become for this purpose a party to the Conference and to submit its case to the Conference, and in such case the pro-visions hereinbefore contained shall be applicable to the dispute both against and in favour of such State in all respects as if it were a party to this Convention.Asticle 14.If the State not party to this Convention will not accept the invitation to become ad hoc a party to the Conference, the Conference may enquire into the dispute ex parte, and may make a recommendation in the same way as if both parties were present.Article 15.If the Allied State shall be attacked by the other State before an award or a report of the Conference is made, or notwithstanding the compliance of the Allied State with the award or the recommendation (if any) made by the Conference in its report, any of the Allied States may come to its assistance.Article 16.In the case of a dispute between States none of whom are parties to this Conven-tion, any of the Allied States may bring the matter before the Conference with a view to the Conference using its good offices to prevent war.Article 17.Any State not party to this Convention may apply to the Conference for leave to become a party. The Conference will forthwith examine the application favourably, and will determine whether it should be granted and whether it is necessary to impose any terms.Conflict of Treaties. Article 18.A. The Allied States severally agree that the present Convention abrogates ail treaty obligations inter se inconsistent with the terms hereof, and that they will not enter into any engagements inconsistent with the terms hereof.B. Where any of the Allied States, before becoming party to this Convention, shall have entered into any treaty imposing upon it obligations inconsistent with the terms of this Convention, it shall be the duty of such State to take immediate steps to procure its release from such obligations.o
