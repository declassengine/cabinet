12.23MVOCATION,J^ NATURALIZATION.I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet a short Bill which I propose to introduce in the House of Commons at an early date to amend the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, as regards the revocation of certificates of naturalization.    Under the existing law the Secretary of State has power to revoke certificates of naturalization where they have been obtained by false representation and fraud.     Experience gained during the present war has shewn the need for   wider powers of revocation.     The question was considered by the Aliens Committee of the Reconstruction Committee which reported in January last and they recommended that power should be given to the Secretary of State on the advice of a Judicial Committee to revoke certi-ficates in case of disloyalty or criminality.     The attached draft Bill gives effect to this recommendation and was approved in principle by the last Imperial War Conference.There are many other important matters connected with nationality and naturalization which have been raised here or by the Dominions and will have to be discussed later at an Imperial Conference or a conference of experts. These are not yet ripe for legislation.     The question, however, of the revocation of certificates is an urgent one and can be dealt with separately.The draft Bill has been communicated to the Dominion Governments and to the Government of India and has received their approval.G.
