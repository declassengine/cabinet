PACIFISM AND REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.(Circulated by the Home Secretary).LL&amp;I^^Except at the Keighley Election, there has been little Pacifist activity in the oountry during the past fortnight, but the Pacifists have been very busy working underground.     They concentrated their attention upon the Keighley Eleotion, and they now profess great satisfaction with the number of votes they obtained.    The whole strength of the various Sooialist groups was concentrated on the oandidature of Mr. Bland.     Local Socialists were busy in the Trades Councils, trying to snatch Resolutions in support of his candidature,     The Bradford Trades and Labour Council resolved, by a large majority, to send Mr. Bland a message wishing him suooess.    Most of the Independent Labour Party leaders were in Keighley before the Election, flooding the constituency with pamphlets but they did not have it all their own way.     The Leed3 Labour Party, oonvened to discuBs the bye-election, had a stormy Meeting.    Mr. D. B. Foster, the Local Secretary of the Union of Democratic Control, wanted to canvass the members for subscriptions, but the proposal was negatived, and at the Leeds Trades Council, all they oould obtain towards Mrt Bland^ Eleotion expenses was one guinea; softened by a message of sympathy.-&quot;Yesterday, 5th May, was set apart for Sooialist propaganda at open-air meetings.    The greatest effort was ts be made in London, in Finsbury Park, but the Home Secretary prohibited the Meeting and the proposed prooessione.     The Socialists, however, attempted to break up a Loyalist Meeting, and some arrests were made.Throughout the Midlands and the North East of England, there have been noPacifist public meetings, but at Newoastle-on-Tyne, on the 25th April, a Keet-ing of the Union of Democratic Control, presided over by Councillor David Adams,Parliamentary candidate for Newcastle, was held.   The speaker was Mr* Whiteheuse,M.P., who advooated a ohange of Government, with Lord Lansdowne as Premier, andMr. Philip Snewden as Leader of the House of Commons.    The attendance was verysmall.    Mr. Pethiok Lawrence addressed a poorly attended Meeting of theIndependent Labour Party in 1&apos;iddlesbrough on the 18th, but said little beyondthe need for a ohange of Government.    In fact, this appears to be the principaltheme for Pacifists at the moment.My correspondent at Liverpool reports that the Shop Stewards have caasedpassing Paoifist Resolutions, because they know that the men in the shops areitopposed to Peace.    Mr* Pairohild, of the British Sooialist Party, addressed a Meeting of oix hundred persons at St. Martin*s Hall, Liverpool, on the 28th. One of the speakers was Captain White, D.S.O., (the son of General White), who made himself conspicuous in Dublin some years ago.    He has for some time shown symptoms of a lack of mental balance.    He spoke against Conscription in Ireland, and said that an Irish Rebellion would help to bring the War to an end.    About half the audience were women, and there were a good many foreign Jews, two of whom were in khaki.    No reoognised Trade Union leader was present, and the Meeting in no way represented local Organised Labour.    For the next few months Pacifist Meetings will take place out of doors, when of course there is a better opportunity for disseminating their views.    My correspondent, who attended the Meeting, Bays that he noticed a strong
atmosphere of hysteria throughout the prooeedings.A rather remarkable letter was rend at the weekly Meeting of the Liver-po)el Women&apos;s Peace Crusade.    Dr. Hellor, a Unitarian Minister, who read the letter, said that the writer was a oonaoientious objector in Winchester Prison.   The writer declared that the present was not the time for Paoifist prepaganda, and said that there were alternating waves of Pacifism and Patriotism, but eaoh wave brought them nearer Peace.    As soon as the tension on the Western Front was relieved, another wave of Paoifism would come, and that would be the time for the Paoifists to strike, and strike hard.The Workers1 Peace Committee in Glasgow, to whom I have alluded in former Reports, have made plans for launching a Peace offensive as soon as a favourable moment arises.     That the moment is inauspioious was shown at Lanark on the 20th, when a number of wounded soldiers broke up a Meeting of the Independent. Labour Party, and treated the speakers rather roughly.THE WAR LOAfl.My correspondent on the Clyde tells me that Pacifists are spreading a rumour that the investments in War Loan are unsafe;   that aa the next Parliament is to be composed cf Labour Members, they will repudiate their liability, and that the recent resignations at the? Air Board suggest that something is very wrong.     It happens that there is an active collection in the District, of old brass, copper, zino, etc, and ignorant people are feeling nervous about the financial stability of the country,THE PAOIFIST PRESS.There is a proposal to amalgamate &quot;The Dreadnought&quot; and &quot;The Call&quot;. The former is now printed by Mr. Francis, of the Athenaeum, on the oondition that he should censor objectionable matter, but the former printer now deolines to allow him any of the paper allotted to the Labour Press.Mr, Lansbury is said to have collected enough capital for launching a daily Labour paper.   This is not to be a Socialist, but a Labour paper, supporting the Labour Party, who it is hoped will give support to Mr. Lansbury&apos;s candidature.The Paper Controller has declined to give a licence for the Pacifist Sheets the &quot;West London Metal Workers&apos; Reoord&quot;, and Mr. Jack Tanner has there-fore arranged for a West London edition of &quot;Solidarity&quot;,   This will bo watched.COHVIOTIONS UNDER THE DEFENCE OF THE REALM REGULATIONS.*      In oonsequenoe of the sentence of three months passed on A. j. Cooke, there Was a strike last week of some thousands of miners in the Rhondda Valley. It was not a very serious effort to bring pressure on the Authorities, because the miners are accustomed to take a holiday at this time of year, and the men have now gone back to work.    The Chief Constable of Glamorganshire thinks their real opinion is that Cooke only got his deserts.The Hon. Bertrand Russell appealed on the 1st May against his conviction to six months&apos; imprisonment for his article in the &quot;Tribunal&quot;.   The appeal was dismissed with costs, but the sentenoe was altered to six months in the First Division instead of the Seoond Divisicn.THE INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD,This Society still holds Meetings at Theobalds Road on Sunday mornings,
h may, 1918.but the attendance has greatly fallen off, because each member thinks that his neighbour is a government spy, and the majority think it safer to keep away from the meetings.the communist club.the fund for maintaining the communist club amounts to only  211.0.0d. the club has received orders to evaouate the premises by 24th june, but it is trying to find a company of british natirnality to buy the lease, which would prevent the board of trade from intervening.the herald league.this league has now opened a &quot;liberty&quot; club.   they are starting a defence fund for john arnall, who has since been convicted and fined  50 or three months&apos; imprisonment.    arnall and stenning are the only speakers left to the league, who attach great importance to the meetings in finsbury park.monsieur litvinoff.a deserter, private jospoh schnipp, of the 5th battalion, royal fusiliers, has made a statement to the effect that after deserting he called on litvinoff, and had a conversation with himi-&quot;l told litvinoff that i had deserted from the british army, &amp;nd asked him whether I had to serve any longer now that russia was no longer at war.    litvinoff said, &apos;do you know that russia is not * fighting any more?1.   i said, ^es&apos;.   litvinoff said, &apos;do you want to fight?&apos;.   i said, &apos;no. not sinoe russia is not at war&apos;.   litvinoff said, &quot;then you don&apos;t have to fight&apos;.   litvinoff added that the british government compelled the russians to join the british army against their will, and that it was wrong to do so;   that he was working to try and release all russians serving in the british army who did not wish to serve;   that schnipp could suit himself whether he served in the army or not.i then went to the war office on 1st april, and wanted to get my discharge.   no-one oould interpret for me, and I was told to write my request.   i went back to litvinoff&apos;s committee and asked for some-one who would write for me to the war office and staie my case&quot;. a letter has been intercepted from mr. john cox, secretary to the independent labour party, 10, lime grove, gorton, manchester, addressed to litvinoff, forwarding a resolution of the local branch of the independent labour party, which recognized the fidelity of the bolsheviks to the principles of the internationale, and protests against the attacks made upon them by &quot;fellow socialists&quot;.the national council for civil liberties.this council is circulating a petition for the release of mr. arnold lupton, ex-m.p. for sleaford, who was reoently oonvicted in respect of a leaflet.    the petition is couched in moderate language.    the council is also circulating a protest against &quot;propaganda in the military school of thought being pushed among educational authorities and schools&quot;.     a meeting to be addressed by mr. w. 0. anderson, m.p. on this subject, is to be held on 18th may.
