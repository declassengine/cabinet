; Tflie  tocument \q t?va Property o*3P?H.Y OF FLOOR.FCR POO, Jtocrandum by the Ministry of Food..i, i    s.^^T desijte to draw the attention of tho far Cabinet to the question of supplying flour to manufacturers of dog biscuits and to request their ruling as to the course of action to bo t*ken*Tho ^heat Comission cohsider that they have no authority either to import flow or to release flour fit for human food for this purpose. Tho manufacturers1 stocks and stocks in tho hands of retailers Are na&amp;rly exhausted! and Wm &amp;og*ownere are no doubt in many cases supplementing the scanty quantities of biscuits available with broad cr biscuits suitable for human food, although this course is illegal.The quantity of flour used In the manufacture of Dog biscuits usually amounts to about 30,000 tone per annum.   If It is decided to aontinua ths manufacture of dog-bis cult a it Is estimated that this quantity oould bo raduc^d to about one-half by rationing the manufacturers and insisting on an admixture of potatoes and grain offt Is. It must, however, be borne in mind, -(a) That there is objection to importing or releasing flour fit for human consumption in ordor to food dogs, especially when It may not be fad to cattle or poultry;(b) That the Enitod States Pood Administration would not bo likely to approve tho use of finance and tonnage for tho purchase and importation of food for dogs.o)   That if any concession of this kind became known to the  heat Sxocutive, both France and Italy might prefer a similar claim. It is thought that theso difficulties would be to come extent bviated if the recommendations of tho Interdepartmental Committee which a now sitting encouraged action for tho limitation of tho number of oga in the country.In any case It seems clear that some provision mujgt be made for the **ding of dogs.   Otherwioa human food of better quality will certainly used.j.r.CLYN3S.dtry of Food. 2nd May, 1918,t-
