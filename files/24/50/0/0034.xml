IIIt ATO^^^BJg^S-^^Mg OP Bg BRTEAmiO, MAjBSgy-S QOTCMK?) /gCRBgh!&amp;r cabitogote by the Secretary.I have received from the First Lord of the Admiralty a Memorandum, dated I.Iay 3rd, severing a Note by Lord Pirrie, in which it is suggested &quot;that the time of the :;ar Cabinet would &quot;be saved and risk of friction avoided if Ministers,instead of &quot;circulating independent and contentious Memoranda on subjects &quot;common to other Departments, would first of all discuss the Question at issue with the Minister presiding over the &quot;appropriate Department&apos;, **fPaper  .3?o4423)0Lord Pirrie refers specifically to recent cases in which Memoranda on the subject of Shipyard Labour were circulated to tho vfer Cabinet before the points raised in them had been, die-cussed between the Ministers concerned.liord Pirrio suggests that the War Cabinet &quot;should melee a &quot;ruling that all matters that concern two or more Ministries or &quot;Departments should first be discussed by those Departments ^before being presented to the War Cabinet,&quot;I doubt whether any such ruling is required^    Prom the very beginning of the War Cabinet*s work in Decembers 1916, it has been my constant endeavour to see that questions which concern two or more Ministries should first be discussed by those Departments, before I place them upon the Agenda paper.Ministers must be well aware how often I have requested them to settle their Inter-departmental differences &quot;out of ^court^ in order to save the time of the War Cabinet.    Indeed, it. ,.y is hardly too much to say tnat a large portion of the out-going correspondence of this Office has been composed of letters con-taining the familiar formula that ore Minister should confer with another &quot;before bringing the matter to the attention of the War Cabinet*&quot;The need for Inter-departmental conference   before reference, to the War Cabinet is now, in the main, so widely recognised that . 1 hardly think it necessary that the War Csb inet should be asked to give a ruling on what is such an obvious point.It ought to be tairen for granted, as in almost all cases it can be, that when a Memorandum concerning two or more Minis tries, is received at this Office, for circulation to the Wor Cabinet, it has been submitted previously to Inter-departmental discussion,.I am circulating copies of this Hote to all the Departments, in order that their attention may be drawn to the matter.(Sgd.)
