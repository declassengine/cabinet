General Remarks.The Labour Situation.Attention has been drawn on more than one occasion in these Reports to the apparent decline in the power of the unofficial Labour organisations, which represent the more extreme section of the working classes, and which are the outcome of the rank and file movement. This symptom continues, and though it is not suggested that the extremist point of view has in any way changed, it is significant of the small importance which is at present attached to that movement by the mass of the working classes that a threat to national security, such as has been experienced during the past month, suffices to reduce the extremist section to almost total eclipse. It may be that such an experience of national danger is required to enable an accurate judgment of the forces in the Labour world to be formed.Attention was drawn in the Report for the week ending the 17th April to the National Conference of Shop Stewards held in Manchester on the 13th and 14th April. A more detailed account of its proceedings has now been obtained. This report shows that, with the exception of Leicester and London, all the districts were .of opinion that a general peace movement would not be supported by the workers. A resolution proposing the desirability of a general armistice preparatory to peace negotiations was defeated, an amendment to the effect that the time is not opportune to ask the workers to take action for peace terms being accepted. In the course of the debate on the main resolution the Sheffield representatives are stated to have. said that the workers were war mad, and that men who had left jobs at 12Z. a week and accepted others at 305. a week in order to escape military service, were now anxious to join up.[1100-27] B[This Document is the Property-of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.  May 1918.
The proceedings of this Conference appear indeed to have been symptomatic of the temper of the country as a whole. Eeports go to show that in Nottinghamshire the number of miners required for the comb-out has practically been obtained by voluntary enlistment. Similarly, in South Wales where pacifist agitation has always been strong the number of voluntary enlistments is exceedingly large, and the Unofficial Reform Committee of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation has been soundly trounced by Mr. Vernon Hartshorn, on behalf of the Executive Committee! in a speech at Maesteg.Conscription for Ireland.No immediate danger, therefore, appears probable from opposition on the part of organised Labour in Great Britain to the Government&apos;s proposals in order to carry on the war. The question of the conscription of Ireland stands on an entirely different footing. This provision in the Government&apos;s scheme has, as already-reported, been met with a storm of opposition in the Labour and Socialist press. There are, however, certain indications which support the belief that the views of the press are not by any means entirely representative of the views of the working classes. From the Clyde, for instance, reports have been received from two sources to the effect that conscription for Ireland is welcomed as a measure of justice except among the considerable Irish population whose presence is generally resented. In Yorkshire and the East Midlands the excellent reception which has been given to the new Act is said to have been generally due to the inclusion of Ireland, and a, later report states that the Trades Council at Mexborough has refused to accept a resolution condemning conscription for Ireland.In Ireland itself the reception of the new legislation has been sufficiently described in the daily press. The one day protest strike appears to have been universal except in Ulster. It is also reported that strikes in protest have occurred in shipyards in Queenstown and other places, but not in the important yards at Belfast. The &quot; Times &quot; contains information of one interesting sequel to the one-day protest strike. It appears that, at a Government aerodrome which is under constmc-tion, the whole of the employees went on strike with the exception of five loyal men. On the day following the strike the other employees refused to return to work unless these five were dismissed. The authorities in charge of the aerodrome met the demand by dismissing all the strikers and closing down the works.The American Deputation.The American deputation has concluded the first part of its tour and it has proceeded to France. Before leaving England a meeting was held between the deputation and the leading members of the Executive Committee of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress. Mr. Sidney Webb was among those present. The matter of Labour war aims is believed to have been discussed, but agreement was not reached and arrangements have been made for a further conference on this subject on the return of the deputation from France. It is questionable how far the members of the American Party can be said to represent American Labour though on the whole they unquestionably represent the views held by Mr. Samuel Gompers and other officials of the American Federation of Labour. It is known that there is a very large body of organised Labour in America, which has hitherto held views divergent from those so widely advertised by Mr. Gompers. There are, however, signs that a definite split is in progress in the American Socialist and Labour Parties, and that an important number, hitherto hostile to the war policy of the American Government, is now rallying to its support. It appears probable that one result of the German offensive of the last month has been to demonstrate to America in a most effective way the seriousness of the German bid for world power.II, Press Comments.- Military Affairs.There is again remarkably little comment on the military situation in the Labour and Socialist press. The &quot; Labour Leaders opinion is that the recent lull in the fighting is largely due to exhaustion, but the &quot;Clarion &quot; holds that it evidences a failure  by the Germans in carrying out their plans.   The &quot;Leicester Pioneer &quot;
suggests that this is not a proper time for discussing the causes of our reverses, and calls for confidence in our leaders.Foreign Affairs.The attention devoted to foreign affairs has decreased somewhat. The &quot; Call &quot; and Clarion &quot; both deal with Russian affairs, the former suggesting that it would have paid Great Britain and France to have supported the Russian&apos;revolutionaries instead of the reactionaries in Finland and the Ukraine, and the latter discussing a suggestion that Germany will reinforce her depleted armies by conscripting Russians, a policy which it is disposed to regard as impracticable.The &quot; Call &quot; and &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; both publish articles on the Liehnowsky memorandum, suggesting that these disclosures support rather than weaken the case which has been built up by pacifists.The pan-German menace is dealt with by &quot; Justice &quot; from the point of view of the Czechs, and by the &quot; New Age &quot; from the point of view of the Slavs. The latter compliments President Wilson for having seen that Germany&apos;s intention is to build up a hegemony over the world on the abasement of the Slav peoples.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and &quot; Justice &quot; refer to recent peace negotiations. The former thinks that a great opportunity for peace was lost over the Clemenceau-Czernin affair, and that this country must share the blame. It demands a full explanation of the matter, and this is the attitude of &quot; Justice &quot; regarding General Smuts&apos; visit to Switzerland, where it alleges that his work has been continued by Mr. Kerr. This paper also deals with the proposed Inter-Allied Socialist Congress, to which it is still hostile, though its tone is notably more moderate.The Man-Power A ct.Extraordinary little attention is ,paid to this subject, now that the Bill has received the royal assent, The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and &quot;Bradford Pioneer &quot; are prepared to admit that the measure was improved in its passage through the House of Commons by concessions on such points as the calling up of the older men, and the powers of tribunals, though as regards the former, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; points out that the statement as to calling up only 7 per cent, of the older men was rendered valueless bv a further statement made in the House of Lords.Ireland.Ine Irish question is once more very much to the fore, and a tone exceedingly bitter to the Governments policy continues to be characteristic of both sections of the press.The extremist section points out that the Irish people are once more united against their old oppressors. In the &quot;Herald,&quot; Mr. Brailsford has an article in which he compares the extension of conscription to Ireland to the mistakes which used to be made in the Government of our Colonial Empire. He thinks that the Government have failed to appreciate the real basis of nationality, and suggests that English and Scotch working-men will refuse to lire upon the Irish. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks that the Irish movement is simply part of a world-wide stirring against Imperialism and in favour of peace, while the &quot; Call &quot; chooses to regard it as inspired essentially by democratic feeling.The patriotic &quot;Clarion&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot; are inclined to adopt an attitude of &quot; we told you so.&quot; The article in ;; Justice &quot; is by a well-known Labour man, who has recently&apos;returned from Ireland, where he declares that he found all sections uniting to oppose conscription. These papers are inclined to press for an immediate grant of a full measure of Home Rule, after which they hope that the Irish will supply the necessary men of their own accord: as the i! New Age &quot; puts it, Ireland cannot be conscripted to fight for England, but she might very well be persuaded to fight against Prussia, Even the &quot; British Citizen &quot; seems to be of two minds, remarking that the question grows in gravity, but the truth is that Irish contingents are necessary in Ireland&apos;s own interests.Criticism of the Government.Bitter attacks on the Government are a notable feature of this week&apos;s press, though this hostility is largely, though not entirely, confined to the &quot; pacifist &quot; section.
Tlie most significant fact about the &quot;Herald&apos;s &quot; article advocating the immediate formation of a Labour (government &quot; is the fact that the administration as proposed is entirely composed of &quot; Labour &quot; men, and that the names of Lord Lansdowne and others associated with him do not, for the first time, appear. The whole case against the Government is again elaborated, and the opinion expressed that it is on the point of disruption. The &quot; Call &quot; devotes itself chiefly to an attack on the passive policy adopted by the House of Commons, and the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; criticises the Cabinet changes with some severity.The &quot; New Age &apos;&apos; takes the pacifist papers very much to task for their attacks, pointing out that they have never been able to suggest any really possible alternative to the present administration, which, though far from perfect, is not at present either replaceable or likely to be replaced. &quot;Justice,&quot; on the other hand, is not prepared to let the Government off so lightly, and has remarks to make about &quot; blundering incapacity.&quot;The Budget.Criticism of the Budget is on the whole hostile, though some of the bourgeois papers, such as the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; and especially &quot; Common Sense,&quot; are more satisfied. The British Citizen.&quot; however, congratulates the Government on their &quot; sound business-like Budget,&quot; and the !i Woolwich Pioneer &quot; is also disposed to be pleased. The &quot; Clarion &quot; and &quot; Justice &quot; think that it is probably as good a Budget as could, under the circumstances, be expected. The other section is much less pleased, and puts forward the perhaps inevitable attack that too much consideration is being paid to the rich. The u South Yvales Pioneer &quot; calls it a t: Rich Man&apos;s Budget,&quot; the Labour Leader &quot; says that it is a cowardly Budget, and that borrow-ing on a large scale will be necessary, while the &quot;Herald &quot; asks why Death Duties and the Excess Profits Tax have not been increased. The two points on which there is the greatest consensus of hostile criticism are, perhaps, the increase in the sugar tax and the proposals with regard to postage, though opinions in favour of a more steeply-graduated Income Tax are expressed.III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.The situation in this area remains unchanged, and only slight unrest is reported.At Woking there has been some discontent among aircraft wood-workers over a question of piece-time rates.Propaganda as to the methods and objects of the Ministry of Food, which has been carried on at a number of firms in the London district, is said to be having an excellent effect.The grumbling upon the question of extra rations, which was mentioned last week, has apparently subsided.South- Western.Unrest is^reported by the Ministry of Munitions to be still evident in the Bristol areas, and also in the Isle of Wight, Southampton, and Plymouth. The calling-up of the younger men is thought, however, to be having a good effect.West Midlands.Few reports have been received from this district, but these indicate a very satisfactory condition.   The situation is described as so quiet as to be uncanny.Patriotic open-air meetings in Coventry still continue to attract considerable audiences, and have apparently met with much success. The attitude of the A.S.E. shows a great improvement, and no obstacle is being placed in the way of recruiting.Members of the Society of Carpenters and Joiners at Coventry are refusing to work with dilutees in Grade III, and also with discharged soldiers and sailors. At the Standard Motor Company the management were compelled to dismiss a Grade III man in order to avoid a stoppage.
Yorkshire and East Midlands.Apart from a somewhat serious strike of electricians at Chilweli, a satisfactory condition seems to prevail in this area.Pacifist propaganda is not apparently receiving any support at present, and a much advertised Bolshevist meeting in the Jewish Trades Hall at Leeds, on the 27th, was very badly attended, as not more than 50 people appeared. The speaker adopted a commonplace tone, and made slight reference to Bolshevism.At Sheffield pacifist propaganda has come to a standstill, and the budget has been received without any complaints. The situation here indeed appears to be very satisfactory.The Mexborough Trades Council have resolved to ignore a request from the Bradford Trades Council for their support of a resolution condemning Irish con-scription and the incompetency of the present Government,North-Western.Improvement in the situation in this district is evident this week, and the recent grumbling in the Liverpool and Birkenhead areas has much decreased, while all revolutionary talk has vanished.The situation as regards extra meat rations is still somewhat unsatisfactory, as some of the workers have been unable to secure the necessary application forms. The increased contentment which has been observed among the women is said to be due to the fact that they can now procure milk for their children with much greater ease than formerly.In Liverpool the shop stewards&apos; movement seems recently to have lost many of its supporters, owing to their zeal for a revolutionary down-tools policy, which is unacceptable to the rank and file. in Manchester and Barrow also the shop stewards are for the moment quiet, but it is thought that they are watching their opportunity to arouse fresh agitation. This may perhaps arise at Manchester out of dilution, as the skilled men in that area are still intensely suspicious. The local officer of the Ministry of Munitions states in fact that while no objection is taken to discharged soldiers looking on at the work, they are not allowed to put a finger to the tools.The Mersey District Engineering and Shipbuilding Federation are still making efforts to obtain a 47-hour week. But to this demand the A.S.E. officials have refused to give their support, though the rank and file of the Society are nevertheless willing to support the Federation.At a meeting of the Allied Trades on the 22nd, in addition to a consideration of this demand, the peace proposals of the Manchester conference were again brought up, but were ultimately put aside as inopportune. A more pacifist attitude hasT however, been displayed by the Electrical Trades Union in this district, who have determined to call a one-day strike for May 1st as a protest against the Man-Power Act. Their action in this respect is no doubt due to the fact that calling-up notices have been served on a number of their members, as this union, though small, is notorious for its pacifist and revolutionary attitude.At Barrow some trouble has occurred among the boilermakers, who allege that men are being improperly transferred from the army on the grounds that they are riveters or holders-up. Many of these men have been proved to know nothing of the work, and have disorganised squads and retarded production. The local men think that they are simply there to evade military service, and are very discontented.Northern.The situation in this district is very quiet, with the exception of a slight stop-page which occurred at the Castner Kellner Alkali Co. &apos;s works.Work is proceeding well and zeal for recruiting is keen among the miners, while among the skilled men in the shipyards there seems to be some difficulty in preventing their joining the forces.Wales.The situation throughout the district is on the whole satisfactory, and there is little labour unrest to report.[1100-27] C
In the Rhondda Valley, however, considerable agitation has been caused by the imprisonment of the extremist, Arthur J. Cook, and at a meeting held at Forth on the 28th, much feeling in favour of a down-tools policy on this score was evident. A meeting of the Tylorstown Collieries was also held, at which the same view was expressed.It appears that a number of men have already come out in the Rhondda Valley, and at Tylorstown a stoppage is feared to-day. It is thought, however, that no really serious trouble need be anticipated, as the men are very much divided, and many are enlisting.Scotland.In the Clyde area ail is quiet at present, and recruiting is proceeding in a satisfactory manner. No trouble is indeed anticipated, provided that the comb-out is carried out impartially, and no exceptions are given to favoured individuals. The extension of conscription to Ireland is regarded by many of the men as equit-able, and there has in the past indeed been considerable jealousy of the Irish, who have been able to earn large sums by virtue of their immunity from military service.The question of a May Day holiday has been much discussed in the workshops, hut the general opinion is that a considerable number of the men will ultimately remain at work, though some will join the demonstration.A congress of the Scottish Trade Unions has recently been held at Ayr. at which resolutions of a varied nature were passed; the most striking of these was a demand for the establishment of a Scottish Parliament, and that Scotland should be repre-sented as a nation at the Peace Conference.A rumour has been going about the Clyde that money invested in the War Loan can no longer be regarded as safe. The grounds for this are apparently that with the advent of a Labour Government, as is expected, will come a policy of repudia-tion.IV. Disputes. (a.) Involving a. Stoppage of Work.The general situation remains remarkably quiet this week, and again few strikes of any importance are mentioned.The Shipyard Labour Department report only two new stoppages of work Involving 48 men; the number of cases in which work has been resumed during the week is 13.The boilermakers at the Port Talbot Graving Dock ceased work on the 22nd, refusing to accept the established rates for drilling. The men finally returned to work on the under-standing that the rates for future work should be fixed on the 25th.In addition to these cases several stoppages in connection with conscription have taken place in the Irish area. Of these the most important were at the North of Ireland Ship-building Co., the Dublin Dockyard Co., and the Queenstown Drydock Shipbuilding Co. In all but the last-mentioned case, however, a considerable number of men still remained at work.A further and somewhat serious stoppage has now been reported from Messrs. Barclay Curle&apos;s, Glasgow, where all the rivetters employed by the firm struck work over the rates paid on certain piece work. The case is believed now to have been referred to the Controller-General of Shipbuilding for action.  It is feared that this trouble may spread to other yards.Reports of five new strikes have been received from the Ministry of Munitions.The employees of the Castner-Kellner Alkali Co., Wallsend, struck, owing to a demand for a rise in wages, and the refusal of the firm to&apos; meet them on this question. They were finalty persuaded to resume work on the 22nd April pending negotiations.A somewhat remarkable strike has occurred at the munition works of Messrs. Mitchell, Ltd., Dundee, in connection with the payment for the &quot; Dundee spring holiday/&apos; which the firm stipulated should be handed over to the Red Cross Fund. This the workmen refused to do, and fifty-six employees were dismissed in consequence. This caused a strike of about 150 men, and a settlement was only effected upon the reinstatement of the men who had been dismissed.A strike in connection with the 12i per cent, bonus is in progress at the Lycett Saddle and Motor Accessories Co., Birmingham.At Chilwell, in Yorkshire, a strike of electricians, involving some 200 men, has taken place. The trouble arose out of a squabble between a workman and his foreman and the refusal of the management to* dismiss the latter.At the present moment it appears that there are only two cases of strikes in progress at munition works.
The. War Office Contracts Department has only one new stoppage to report, while all old cases of strikes appear to have been settled.This stoppage occurred at Messrs. Walsh and Co., Bristol, where the firm refused to discuss a question of wage increases with the union representative. The union state that the firm locked out 125 workers, and therefore about 400 others ceased work. It is not thought likely that discontent will spread to other works.Six new stoppages of work are reported by the Coal Controller, which have rendered approximately 8,225 men idle.  Work has been resumed in one case,A stoppage occurred at the Lofthouse Colliery, Yorkshire, as a protest against certain exemptions from military service which had been granted to mechanics and clerks; the case is now under investigation.A stoppage in connection with the question of non-unionist labour also occurred in a Durham colliery.(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.The Shipyard Labour Department report 21 new controversial cases and 89 old; of the total 32 have now been settled. The total number of cases still under investiga-tion is therefore 78; this is the first time that this number has fallen below 100 for many months.None of these cases appear to be of any importance.The Ministry of Munitions has only four cases of dispute to record, and of these two have already been settled. None of these cases are very important, and they have arisen out of such questions as dilution, the 7-J per cent, bonus, arbitration delays, and the wording of an award.One new dispute is mentioned by the War Office Contracts Department and two old cases still remain unsettled.An application for increases in wages has been made by the United Garment Workers&apos; Union to manufacturers&quot; associations in the wholesale trade. The replies to this request have been unsatisfactory, and the Union Executive threatened a strike. This has been temporarily averted, however, so that an interview with the Ministry of Labour might take place.The firm of Venable-s and Co., Birmingham, have received a demand for a 15 per cent, increase to employees engaged on brass spring hooks. This they refused as there had recently been an advance of 10 per cent. The men refuse to give way, though the employers have now offered a, 10 per cent, advance.The Coal Controller has no controversial cases to report. The Scottish miners have requested the Miners Federation to make an application for a further increase in wages to meet the cost of living.The Committee on Production has heard 44 arbitration cases, 24 in London and 20 in Scotland, during the last week. One case has been heard arising out of the 12^ per cent, orders. On Friday the Committee heard the application of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for an advance of 8d. per hour to certain of their members. The Port of London Authority was, as stated last week, an interested party in this case, but refused to appear before the Committee.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 138 differences during the week.The total number of differences for the month of April is 750, a considerable decrease upon the number reported in March.Among the cases referred to the Committee on Production is that involving a national claim for the extension to all semi-skilled and unskilled workmen in the aircraft industry of the award granting the 12^ per cent, bonus to skilled aircraft workers.D. J. SHACKLETON.
