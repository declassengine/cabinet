PRESS   REPORTS   OF   THE   DOINGS   OF COLONIAL   TROOPS.Note by tho Secretary of State for the Royal Air Force,I hayo.received a copy of Minute 8 of tho 478th Meeting cf tho War Cabinet, stating that It has been decided to constitute a Committee, under Mr. Chamberlain, to consider tho whole question of &apos;the publicity given to the performances of British troops.      This question had beon raised by the Ministry of Information in a letter addressed to Sir Maurice Hankey, G.T. 5765.I was unfortunately not aware that this subject was to be discussed on this occasion,, nor was I, nor the Chief cf the Air Staff, summoned to attend the meeting of the Cabinet. .I do not wish in any way to oppose the establishment of a Committoe, as no doubt performances of British troops have not received due recognition in the Dominions, but as I have had no opportunity of putting the views of the Air Ministry before the Cabinet on this subject, I wish at once to submit the reasons which compel the Air Ministry tc. maintain its refusal to follow the French and German practice of publishing the names and records of &quot;aces&quot;.      In this attitude the Air Ministry have had the consistent support of the Commanders in the field, to whose opinion on such a matter the greatest weight must be attached.I am informed that in the French Air Service it is generally agreed that their practice is harmful, although it cannot now be abandoned, while the American Authorities are now following our own practice.The reasons on which our attitude is based, have already been given, but I will repeat thorn as concisely as possible.Fighting In the air is but one of the functions of the Forces     It is necessary only so far as to enable other functions, which from the military point of view are . the prime functions, to be carried out, namoly, artillery observation, reconnaissance and low fighting against troops.     These demand a degree of courage and experience in no way inferior to that of the fighting pilot, while It is no exaggeration tc say that in existing conditions the task of the long distance bombing pilot demands a pre- -eminent measure of courage, determination and endurance. None of these functions lend themselves to the ready publicity which can be given to the exploits of the fighting pilot, yet it Is essential in the interests of the Force that the pilots carrying Out these functions should receive from the Government and the Public the recognition which their performances merit, not only as a matter of justice, but in order that their standard of efficiency may be maintained,     Furthermore, it has boen found in other Servioes that the glorification of the fighting pilot in the newspapers, has boon deleterious to the morale of the Force as a whole.P.T.O.
For these reasons I cannot agree to this quesl? being reopened by the Ccmmi&apos;tee, but I have no, doubt th the Committee will bo ablo to assist thfc Ministry&quot; of Information to obtain better publicity by other methods which are&apos;not open to objection.Tho Air Ministry must certainly be prepared to lend all assistance -possible, and it certainly does not appear to me that suitable material for their activitie is lucking nor has it been withheld. As an example, I append a oopy of a recent &quot;London Gazette&quot;, which annc the award of a large number of decorations to officers the Air Force, together with an account of the serviced which have earned them. It is difficult to Imagine better material for publicity, yet the use of it will n involve recognition being given to one branch of the Se alcne tc the exclusion of other equally important brancI feel sure, alsa, that if the Ministry cf Information will consult the Director cf Intelligence a the Air Ministry,, it will be possible to obtain ample material for his activities.It is also possible to correct the statement wh! Lord Beaverbrook states Is being circulated in Canada, I the effect that 75$ of the fighting airmen are Canadian The actual percentages of flying officers in the Force as followsj-&quot;:&quot; Tctal.   -  nj&amp;g Field.1.   British , -  . ,&apos;  77^ 77^2.   Canadians. -    15% 14$3.   Other Dominionc8% 9%There Is no objection to these percentages bein published, and it is possible that a similar statement regarding the percentage of casualties borne by British and Dominion troops oould likewise be published in ordei to correct a similar impression about the fighting force as a whole.

Early&quot; one morning he, &quot;with another pilot, attacked an enemy aero-drome. Seeing three machines brought out of a burning hangar he dived five times, firing bursts at these from a very low alti-. tude, and dropped bombs on the living quarters. lie then saw an enemy aeroplane descending over the aerodrome; he attacked it and drove it down in flames. Later, when returning from a reconnaissance of the damaged hangars, he was attacked by three Albatross Scouts, who pursued him to our lines, when he turned and attacked one, which fell out of control and crashed (D.S.O. gazetted 11th August, 1917; D.S.C. gazetted 20th July, 1917; D.F.C. gazetted 3rd August, 1918.)Lieut. (Hon. Oapt.) Bernard Arthur Smart. D.S.O. (Sea Patrol).&apos;.Led his flight for 160 miles over sea and land, and destroyed by bombs an im-portant enemy airship shed. This service was carried out under exceptionally difficult - circumstances, requiring great skill, and was most creditably performed. (D.S.O. gazetted 2nd November, 1917.)AWABDED  THE DISTINGUISHED SEEVICE OBDEB.Lieut. (Hon. Capt.) William FOrster Dick-son (Sea Patrol).Displayed great skill and gallantry on the occasion of a long-distance bombing raid. He succeeded in dropping bombs on an air-ship station from a . low altitude with destructive effect, and although subjected to severe fire from the enemy obtained valuable information.Captain (T. /Major) David Edmund Stodart. D.F.C.Whilst commanding a flight of the Royal Air Force the whole of the flying officers had become incapacitated through sickness or wounds, &quot;and their duties were then per-formed by himself,  in addition to  hie
administrative work as commanding officer. During this period Major ,Stodart dropped 115 bombs on the enemy &apos;s position, ex-posed 326 negatives over enemy territory,, and acted as observer for 163 rounds of our heavy artillery.

(T./iCapt.) Arthur Henry Cobby, D.F.C. (Australian Flying Corps). &apos;    .One evening this officer, in company with another machine, attacked five Pfaltz Scouts, destroying two; one fell in flames, and one broke up in the air. The officer 1 who accompanied him brought down a third machine out of control. While engaged in this combat they were attacked from above by five triplanes. Displaying cool judgment and brilliant flying, Captain Cobby evaded this attack and returned to our lines in safety, both machines being undamaged. A determined and most skilful leader, who has destroyed twenty-one hostile machines or balloons, accounting for three machines and two balloons in four days. (The announcement of award of first Bar is also contained in this Gazette; D.F. Cross was gazetted on 3rd August, 1918.)AWARDED A BAR TO THE DISTINGUISHED FLYING CROSS.Lieut. William Gordon Claxton, D.F.C.This officer is conspicuous for his courage in attack. Recently in one day he destroyed &apos;., six enemy aeroplanes four in the morning and two in the evening. In thirteen days he accounted for fourteen machines. His utter disregard of danger inspires all who serve with him.&apos; (D.F.C. gazetted 3rd August, 1918.)Lieut. (T./Capt.) Arthur Henry Cobby, D.F.C. (Australian Flying Corps).An officer whose success as a leader is due not only to high courage and brilliant flying, but also to the clear judgment and presence of mind he invariably displays. His ex-ample, is of great value to other pilots in his squadron. During recent operations he shot down five machines in eleven days, account-ing for two in one day.(D-.F.C. gazetted 3rd August, 1918.)Lieut. (T.-/Capt.) James Ira Thomas Jones,M.C., D.F.C., M.M.A gallant officer who in the last three months has destroyed twenty-one enemy aeroplanes. On one occasion he attacked a Halberstadt two-seater, which was escorted by two scouts. On his approach the scouts deserted the two-seater, which he shot down in flames. He then pursued the two scouts, one of which he destroyed.(M,C. gazetted 16th September, 1918, D.F.C. gazetted 3rd August, 1918, M.M. gazetted 10th August, 1916.)Lt. (T./Capt.) Edgar James McClaughry,.D.F.C. (Australian Flying Corps).In the short space of one month this officer has destroyed ten enemy aeroplanes and balloons. He has organised and carried out numerous raids on the enemy, frecpuently at very low altitudes. Altogether he has destroyed fifteen aeroplanes and four bal-loons. Early one morning he crossed our lines to attack a balloon which he had pre-viously located. As soon, as daylight allowed he dived and opened fire on the balloon, which was on the ground, descend-ing to within fifty feet of it. The balloon burst into flames. He then attacked some horse transport, dropping bombs and firing some 300 rounds at 1,500 feet altitude.(The award of D.F.C. is also contained in this Gazette.)Lieut. (T./Capt.) John Stanley Fleming Morrison, D.F.C.A distinguished and zealous officer whose success in carrying out photographic recon-naissances is marked. He has also on several occasions led his flight on long-distance bombing raids, displaying sound leadership and powers of endurance. (D.F.C. gazetted 3rd June, 1918.)Lieut. (T./Capt.) George Edward Henry McElroy, M.C., D.F.C. (Royal G. Artillery). In the recent battles on various army fronts this officer has carried out numerous patrols, and flying at low altitudes, has in-flicted heavy casualties on massed enemy-troops, transport, artillery teams, etc., both with machine-gun fire and bombs. He has destroyed three enemy kite balloons and forty-three machines, accounting for eight of the latter in eight consecutive days. His brilliant achievements, keenness and dash have at all times set a fine example, and inspired all who came in contact with him. (M.C. gazetted 26th March, 1918, 1st Bar 22nd April, 1918, 2nd Bar 26th July, 1918. D.F.C. gazetted 3rd August, 1918.)AWARDED THE DISTINGUISHED FLYING CROSS.Lieut. Charles Torr Anderson.. An exceptionally skilful and intelligent observer, who on numerous occasions has most successfully directed artillery fire on hostile batteries, transport and massed in-fantry. His reconnaissance reports1 also have been most valuable and accurate, and of the greatest assistance to our raiding par-ties. Recently in twenty-four hours this officer was in the air for over seven; during this time he directed fire on four hostile bat-teries, all of which were silenced, and three heavy explosions were caused. He also re-ported by zone call ten other batteries, good results being obtained on each position. In addition, he carried out two valuable recon-naissances of enemy wire entanglements at low altitudes.Lieut, (temp. &apos; Capt.) Sydney Anderson (Sea Patrol).In an engagement between three of our machines and seven of the enemy this officer displayed remarkable courage and deter-mination.   Wounded early in the fight and
suffering great gain, he continued the action, and drove down one hostile aircraft, causing it to make a very had landing.Lieut. (Hon. Capt.) Thomas Cochrane Angus (Hon. Art. Co.).A gallant and skilful officer, who has taken part in eleven long distance night bombing raids. On one of these his machine alone, out of the five detailed, reached the objec-tive. The weather conditions were most difficult; despite this, and in face of severe anti-aircraft fire, he successfully bombed his target.Lieut. Gordon Frank Mason Apps.A bold and skilful airman who in recent operations has destroyed six enemy aero-planes, accounting for two in one flight. He displays marked determination and devotion to duty.Lieut. Owen Morgan Baldwin.A gallant and skilful pilot who has on many occasions attacked troops and trans-port at low altitudes.

On the return journey continuous fighting took place, and three enemy aeroplanes were driven down.Lieut. Robert Stevenson Bell.This officer, while carrying out observa-tion service from a balloon, was subjected to heavy and continuous shell fire for over 2\ hours, his balloon being punctured in nine places; despite this he continued his observation. On several previous occasions he has displayed equal coolness and disre-gard of danger, carrying on his observation service in face of heavy hostile fire.Lieut (T./Capt.) William Wedgwood Benn, D.S.O. (London Yeo.).A gallant observer of exceptional ability. After setting out on a bombing raid, the Scout machines assigned to act as an escort became separated, and it then became neces-sary for the bombing planes to proceed on their task without support. Captain Benn&apos;s machine took the lead, followed by three other bombers, and succeeded in dropping his bombs (direct hits) on an enemy aero-drome. On the return journey the bomb-ing machines were attacked by several enemy scouts, which were eventually driven away. Recently, this officer organised and carried out a special flight by night over the enemy&apos;s llines, under most difficult circumstances, /with conspicuous success. Ho has at all times set a splendid example of courage.Capt. Eric Bourne Coulter Betts, D.S.C. (Sea Patrol).An observer officer of great skill, who has carried out over 20 long-distance photo-graphic reconnaissances during the past four months, and in conjunction with his pilot, has brought home about 1,000 photographs of enemy positions of inestimable value, in addition to destroying eight enemy machines.Lieut. George Holyoake Box.This officer has taken part in eighteen long-distance night bombing raids and ten long-distance night reconnaissances, at. all times showing exceptional keenness, untiring energy and devotion to duty. One night he carried out a very important reconnaissance lasting three and a half hours, bringing back most valuable information. Immediately on his return he proceeded on a bombing raid; having found his objective, he descended to a low altitude and successfully bombed the target. He was in the air that night six hours.Lieut. Albert James Ernest Broomfield.This officer shows great determination and skill in carrying out night reconnaissances, frequently under adverse weather conditions and at very low altitudes. During last month he was engaged in eight most success-ful reconnaissances. On two consecutive nights when, owing to the darkness he was compelled to fly at about 500 ft. altitude, he located and bombed with success an impor-tant railway junction.Lieut. Colin Peter Brown (Sea Patrol).Was engaged in a bombing raid on an enemy seaplane base by night, and dropped his bombs from a height of 500 feet, causing considerable destruction. Shortly after-wards he bombed an enemy aerodrome in daylight, also from a height of 500 feet, and then descended to 300 feet and destroyed an enemy machine. On arriving at his aero-drome fifty-nine bullet-holes were found in his machine. He has since then destroyed two enemy aeroplanes. Lieutenant Brown has been engaged in several other aerial fights, and has proved himself a gallant and resourceful flight leader.Lieut. Richard Claude Cain.By his skill and initiative as an observer this officer has on many occasions directed fire on enemy artillery, wagon lines and convoys, causing serious damage. His work has been most valuable, carried out at times under very difficult conditions. On a recent occa-sion he successfully bombed&apos; a bridge, obtain-ing a direct hit at a low altitude.Lieut.  (T./Capt.) John Foster Ohisholm,D.S.C. (Sea Patrol).A gallant and successful Flight Comman-der.  He has led his formation in twenty-five- raids in a period of thirty days, generally to a distance of 25 miles over the lines. On a recent occasion he encountered seven enemy aircraft whilst he was engaged in bombing a particularly dangerous enemy position. He destroyed one enemy machine, and his forma-tion accounted for three more. Alb our machines returned safely.
, Lieut. Leonard Arthur Christian (late R.N.A.S.).Since joining his squadron this officer has taken part in forty-seven bomb raids, dis-playing at all times keenness and determina-tion, and rendering his pilot most valuable support. He has accounted for four enemy aeroplanes, destroying two, and driving down two out of control.Lieut. Henry Edward Clark (Sea Patrol).An officer of exceptional skill and deter-mination as observer and bomb-dropper. He has been engaged on thirty raids, and re-cently obtained direct hits on a great enemy war factory which caused immense ex(\)lc* sioiis and fire therein.2nd Lieut. George Brenton Coward (Sea Patrol).A very efficient pilot and able leader who has done most valuable service, displaying at all times the greatest courage and devo-tion to duty. When attacking lock-gates and shipping in an enemy port he sunk a hostile destroyer, obtaining a direct hit on its stern.Capt. Bernard Charles Henry Cross (Sea Patrol).Has set a splendid example to young pilots by his gallantry in going up in any weather when the necessity so demands. Captain Cross has carried out a vast number of re-connaissance patrols in hostile waters, and has attacked submarines on many occasions.Capt. Cyril Marconi Crowe. M.C.This officer has been engaged on.active operations over the lines for over twelve months, and has accounted for ten enemy aeroplanes. He is a most successful leader, distinguished for skill and bravery. On a recent occasion he, accompanied by two other machines, attacked an enemy forma-tion consisting of four biplanes and one tri-plane. Having destroyed a biplane he engaged the triplane at close range and destroyed that also.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Philip Hildersley Cum-mings (Seaforth Highlanders).This officer has carried out over 100 night bombing raids, often under most adverse weather conditions and in face of heavy hos-: tile fire. On three consecutive nights he bombed two enemy aerodromes, obtaining direct hits , at 1,000 ft. altitude. On another raid, owing to engine trouble he was unable to climb over 2,000 ft.; he neverthe-less reached his objective. On all occasions this officer displays marked determination and courage.Lieut. Douglas Darby (Scottish Rifles).This officer has taken part in twenty-four long-distance night raids, displaying at all times remarkable determination and bravery. During recent operations he played a very prominent part in two successful night raids. In one he descended to between 500 and 150 feet altitude, getting well over the target to ensure his bombs being effective; in the other he was one of the first to find hie objective, and, descending to .500 ft. altitude, he dropped his bombs.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Francis James Davies.During recent operations this officer has accounted for five enemy aeroplanes. Bold in attack and skilful in manoeuvre, he is a valuable airman who sets a fine example to all.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Richard Jeffrey Dawes.During recent operations this officer has destroyed six enemy aeroplanes. A very gallant and courageous officer.Lieut. Samuel Dawson (Sea Patrol).Was engaged in a long-distance bombing raid on an enemy aircraft station under very difficult circumstances, and, carried out a successful attack from a low height in the face of severe enemy fire.Lieut. (Hon. Capt.) Hippolyte Ferdinand elarue (Sea Patrol).This officer, in a Short seaplane, accom-panied by another, formed escort to machines carrying out a long-distance bombing raid. When nearing the objective both machines were attacked by a fast enemy scout, and the companion plane was forced to alight. Captain Delarue at once followed it down, picked up pilot and observer, and returned with the two additional passengers. A brave and meritorious action, for the risk he ran was great in such close proximity to the enemy, it being extremely doubtful if his machine would rise from the water with four on board.2nd Lieut. Edward Alpbonse Dew.A keen and dashing officer, who has taken part in numerous bombing raids and photo-graphic reconnaissances. Whilst on a bomb-ing raid his machine, flying in rear of the formation, was attacked by five enemy scout6. Two of these he engaged at close range; at the outset he was dangerously wounded in the thigh. Despite this he continued firing his guns until he fainted from loss of blood. He succeeded in bringing down one of the scouts in flames.Lieut. (Hon. Capt.) Euan Dickson, D.S.C. (late R.N.A.S.);Since 17th April, 1918, this officer has led eighty-four successful bombing raids. His leadership has been conspicuous for remark-able bravery, skill, and determination. On one raid directed against a town in occupa-tion by the enemy he obtained seven direct hits on the railway station and four on a dump outside. Thrice on a prior date he led his flight to attack enemy billets and horse - lines, descending to low altitudes and engag-ing enemy troops on the ground-.Oapt. Grahame Donald (Sea Patrol). , An exceedingly keen and capable Pilot, who has proved himself subsequently to be a skilful Flight Commander. Has carried out valuable escort and reconnaissance patrols, and has brought down at least two enemy aircraft.Lieut. Oedric George Edwards.The fearlessness and disregard of danger displayed by this officer in attacking enemy troops, etc., at low altitudes is most marked, and worthy of the highest praise.   On one
occasion in an attack on an aerodrome, to enable him to fire on the hangars he de-scended so low that the wheels of his machine touched the ground. He has in air combats destroyed three hostile aircraft.Capt. Albert James Enstone, D.S.C. (Sea Patrol).Has been engaged for eighteen months on active service Hying (ten months as Flight Leader). Has destroyed twelve hostile machines and brought down six more out of control. During the past month Capt. Enstone attacked an enemy gun, which was firing on one of our crashed machines, and succeeded in blowing up the ammunition dump alongside the gun, causing a great ex-plosion, with flames reaching to a height of nearly 300 feet.Capt. Stanley John Fetherston (Sea Patrol)..Has been continuously employed on long reconnaissances for fourteen months, during which period he 1ms been in action many times with hostile aircraft. Capt. Fether-ston has always performed his arduous duties with courage and determination. He assisted a few months back in destroying an enemy submarine.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Gordon Fox-Rule.Whilst on a bombing raid this officer dived to 100 feet and obtained a direct hit on a bridge, completely destroying it. Seeing a body of the enemy on the bank of the river he attacked them, causing them to disperse in disorder. He was then attacked by five biplanes; these he drove off, though his ob-server had been hit twice, and he landed safely at a French aerodrome. In all, he has taken part in thirty bomb raids and ten photographic reconnaissances, invariably dis-playing a marked offensive spirit.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Reginald George David Francis (Australian Flying Corps).During two consecutive days this officer carried out most valuable work in ranging on batteries. Flying 8-1 hours the first day and four hours the second, he successfully ranged our artillery on seven hostile bat-teries. In co-operating with our artillery he shows conspicuous bravery and marked ability.Capt. John Osborn Galpin, D.S.C. (Sea Patrol).A skilful and gallant pilot, who has per- -formed valuable services in attacks on enemy aircraft.Capt. James Lindsay Gordon (Sea Patrol).A pilot of great experience, initiative and skill. Has led formations over the seas and attacked with success enemy aircraft in their own area. Capt. Gordon has been instru-mental in saving life in disabled seaplanes on several occasions, and whenever any arduous duty has to be done, he is always to the fore to carry it out.Lieut. John Sharpe Griffith.During the last few months this officer has destroyed three enemy aeroplanes and assisted in bringing down a fourth; he has, in addition, driven down two balloons and shot down two machines out of control. Whilst leading his patrol at 11,000 ft. alti-tude he observed three enemy aeroplanes at 2,000 ft.; he immediately dived and led his patrol to the attack, destroying two of the machines, one of which he accounted for himself.   A gallant and determined officer.Lieut. William Grossart.During the last two and a half months this officer has carried out twenty-seven success-ful bombing raids and twenty-five special photographic reconnaissances, his services on the latter duty being exceptionally valuable. This officer possesses a fine spirit of deter -mination; neither strong opposition nor adverse weather conditions deters him from achieving his object.Lieut. Alfred John Haines.During the past three months this very gallant pilot has destroyed five enemy machines, and earlier in the year he crashed another. He was killed in action on 10th August, 1918.Lieut. (T./Capt.) George Henry Harrison (Middlesex Regiment).A gallant officer of great initiative and re-source, who has carried out seven successful night reconnaissances and sixteen night bombing raids during recent operations. One night when on reconnaissance he re-mained in the air two and a half hours, despite the fact that his engine was cut out thrice and his machine badly shot about.Lieut. Thomas Sinclair Harrison.When on wireless interception duty this officer engaged three enemy machines, shoot-ing down one in flames. He was then - attacked by three scouts and a two-seater; the latter he shot down. During the last few weeks he has further accounted for three hostile aeroplanes and a balloon, displaying vigour and gallantry in attack.Lieut. (Hon. Capt.) Edwin Tufnell Hayne, D.S.C. (late R.N.A7S.).During the recent enemy offensive this officer carried out forty-eight special , missions. Flying at extremely low alti-tudes he has inflicted heavy casualties on massed troops and transport. In addition he has accounted for ten enemy machines, destroying three and driving down seven out of control; in these encounters he has never hesitated to engage the enemy, however superior in numbers. On one occasion he observed ten hostile aeroplanes harassing three Dolphines; he&apos; attacked three of the enemy, driving one down in flames.Capt. Richard Hilton, M.C. (Royal Garrison Artillery).An officer who shows remarkable skill and. courage in co-operating with our artillery,, and in carrying out photographic reconnais-sances. He also proved himself a very-gallant leader on a recent raid, when he led&apos; two low patrols over the lines, attacking with machine-gun fire and heavily bombing enemy reserves. The machine in which he was flying was rendered useless for further-service, so intense was the hostile aircraft fire..Capt. (T./Major)&apos; Thomas Hinshelwcod (Sea Patrol).A most efficient squadron commander. With great ability and judgment he ^as led
his squadron on photographic and long-distance bombing raids, obtaining valuable information. The high standard of efli-ciency attained by his squadron is largely due to his personal influence.Lieut. (T./iCapt.) Jeffrey Batters Home-Hay, M,C. (A. &amp; S. Highrs.).This officer displayed admirable coolness and resource while leading a raid on an enemy railway station. His formation was heavily attacked by seven aeroplanes, but keeping it well in hand, he fought his way to his objective; proceeding well over the station, he successfully bombed it. In the course of the severe fighting two hostile machines were shot down out of control, one of which he himself brought down. He has taken part in eight other raids, and his con-sistent gallantry is a valuable asset in main-taining the moral of his new squadron.Lieut. (T. /Capt.) Cedric Ernest Howell.On a recent occasion this officer, leading his patrol of three machines, attacked nine enemy aeroplanes, destroying six and driving down one out of control; he himself accounted for two of these. On a former occasion he destroyed three enemy aeroplanes in one flight. He is a fine fighting officer, skilful and determined. *Lieut. Paul Thayer Iaccaci.A bold and successful fighter, who on four offensive patrols has accounted for six enemy aeroplanes; two1 he shot down himself, and four were destroyed with the assistance of his observer. In these several encounters the formation in which Lieut. Iaccaci was serving was engaged against heavy odds.Lieut. (Hon. Capt.) William Douglas Jackson (Sea Patrol).Led his flight in a long-distance bombing raid on an enemy aircraft station under very difficult circumstances, and carried out a successful attack from a low height, in the face of severe enemy fire.Lieut. John Kingsley Jeakes (Sea Patrol).A gallant officer who has taken part in numerous long-distance reconnaissance and bombing raids. While on one of the latter he destroyed an enemy seaplane on the water, obtaining two direct hits.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Norman Cyril Jones (R.F.A., T.F.).A gallant and skilful patrol leader who has proved successful on many occasions against numerically superior enemy formations. Capt. Jones has personally destroyed six enemy machines this year.Lieut. Gordon Sheppard Jones-Evans (Aus-tralian Flying Corps).On returning from a raid on enemy rolling stock this officer observed an enemy two-seater machine below him; engaging it, the machine dived vertically and crashed. He was then attacked by a second two-seater; into this he fired a very short burst and it also spun down and crashed. In this en-gagement Lieutenant Jones-Evans was wounded, but though faint from loss of blood, he succeeded in reaching our lines, where he crashed.   In the last few weeks hehas destroyed three two-seaters and brought down one balloon in flames.Lieut. (Hon. Capt.) William Lancelot Jordan, D.S.C. (late R.N.A.S.).A brilliant and most gallant leader who has already been awarded the D.S.C. and Bar for distinguished services and devotion to duty. He has led numerous offensive patrols into action, displaying at all times marked ability, determination and dash. He is an ideal Squadron Commander who has person-ally accounted for twenty-five enemy machines.Lieut. Solomon Clifford Joseph (Sea Patrol). A gallant pilot who has accounted for eight enemy aircraft within the past four months. On many occasions the enemy were numeric-ally superior to Lieutenant Joseph&apos;s patrol, but this did not prevent his attaining success.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Noel Keeble, D.S.C. (Sea Patrol).This officer (with an observer) has obtained 1,000 invaluable photographs of enemy posi-tions miles behind the lines, and has brought home extremely important new information during this period. He has destroyed eight enemy machines, including one biplane during the past month. Captain Keeble is a most capable and gallant Flight Comman-der.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Dennis Latimer, M.C.When leading an offensive patrol this officer displayed great skill and bravery. Having shot down a scout in flames, he imme-diately engaged a second, which he destroyed after a short combat. In addition, he has accounted for four other machines.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Frederick Andrew Laughlin.While bombing an important railway station the formation, of which this officer was leader, was attacked by about twenty enemy scouts. In the engagement that ensued two enemy aeroplanes were destroyed and a third driven down out of control. These results were largely due to his excel-lent leadership. He has taken part in forty bomb raids, the objectives of many being far over the enemy lines. His knowledge of navigation and skill as a leader have been invaluable in enabling the formation to reach the objectives.    _Lieut. (T./Capt.) Gwilyn Hugh Lewis (Northamptonshire Regiment).It is largely due to this officers ability and judgment as a flight leader that many enemy machines have been destroyed with very few casualties in his formation. He is bold in attack, and has personally accounted for eight enemy aircraft, displaying marked disregard of personal danger.Capt. (T./Maj.) Gerald Edward Livock (Sea Patrol).Has rendered valuable services on numerous occasions on reconnaissance patrols in enemy waters, in attacks on hostile sea-planes, and in connection with anti-submarine patrol work.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Edgar James McClaughry (Australian Flying Corps).Early one morning this officer left the ground, and, meeting, an enemy two-seater
. ten miles over the lines, lie engaged and destroyed it. He was immediately attacked by five scouts; these he out-manoeuvred, destroying one and driving the remainder down, lie is a determined and successful scout leader, who in recent operations has accounted for nine enemy machines, in addi-tion to three others and one balloon when serving with another squadron.Lieut. Christopher McEvoy.A gallant pilot who has destroyed six enemy machines in a few months. He dis-plays great determination in his attacks in nigh or low flying, and in bombing attacks over the enemy&apos;s lines.Lieut. Clifford McEwen, M.C. (Can. Inf., Res. Bn.).A skilful and fearless officer who in three weeks destroyed five enemy aeroplanes. (Notification of this award appeared in Gazette 2nd July 1918.)Lieut. (T./Capt.) Evans Alexander McKay, M.C.This officer led a raid on an important railway station; during this operation, which was most successful, 24 hostile aircraft at-tacked his formation. In the engagement he displayed fine leadership and skill. Three of the hostile machines were destroyed and one driven down. He is an exceptionally good formation leader, and his determina-tion to reach his objective is only equalled by his coolness and courage when attacked.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Donald Roderick Mac-Laren, M.C.Accompanied by two other pilots, this officer attacked four enemy aeroplanes; all of these were destroyed; he himself fought two down to within 200 feet of the ground, destroying both. The two pilots who were with him each accounted for one of the re-maining two. It was a well-conceived manoeuvre ably carried out, reflecting credit on all concerned. This officer has in four-and a-half months accounted for 37 hostile aircraft and six balloons, displaying great resolution and exceptional tactical ability.Lieut. Roy Manzer.While carrying out a solitary patrol he observed a two-seater below him; diving on it he opened fire, and following it down to 1,000 feet, caused it to land outside the aerodrome. During his return to our lines he saw a hostile kite balloon; attacking it as * it was being hauled down he closed to point blank range at 300 feet altitude; on reach-ing the ground, the balloon burst into flames. In addition to the above, this officer has accounted for seven enemy machines, &quot; four of which were destroyed and three driven down out of control.Lieut. (Hon. Capt.) Harold Thomas Mell-ings, D.S.C. (Sea Patrol).A very gallant officer who, on a recent patrol, attacked and caused to crash an enemy two-seater. Later, on the same patrol, he was attacked by four Fokkers, one of which he shot down at a range of ten yards; this machine was seen to crash. A second was driven down smoking. Since he was awarded a Bar to the Distinguished Ser-vice Cross Captain Mellings has, in additionto the above, accounted for eleven enemy machines seven destroyed, and four driven down out of control.Lieut. (T./Capt.) James Mitchell, M.C.During the last few months this officer has destroyed five enemy aeroplanes, displaying at all times gallantry and devotion to duty. (Notification of this award appeared in Gazette 2nd July 1918.)Lieut. Marthinus Theunis Steyn Papenfus.This officer displayed excellent judgment in a recent raid. Keeping his formation well together, and, descending to low altitude, he led them well over an enemy factory and so enabled them to use their bombs most effec-tively. The success of this operation was very largely due to his fine leadership. In addition, he has taken part in eighteen raids as deputy leader of the formation, invari-ably showing the greatest keenness and devotion to duty.Lieut. Joshua Parke.This officer has taken part in 40 long-dis-tance day bomb raids and photographic reconnaissances. His work as an observer has been consistently good, and he displays great gallantry and determination, notably in a bombing -raid when he was observer to the leader of our second formation.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Herbert Andrew Patey (Sea Patrol).Whilst leading his flight on an offensive patrol eight enemy machines were encoun-tered. Captain Patey was cut off from his patrol by two of the enemy who got on his tail, and continued in that position until within 2,000 feet of the ground, at which point his machine was hit in the petrol tank. Notwithstanding his serious handicap, he turned four times on his pursuers, destroy-ing one, and driving the remainder away. On previous occasions this officer has de-stroyed two enemy machines and brought down two more out of control, and, in com-pany with other pilots, he has assisted in destroying or bringing down out of control five additional enemy aircraft.i2nd Lieut. William Russell Patey (Royal Irish Rifles).For consistent good work, gallantry, and skill as an observer on long-distance bomb-ing raids and photographic reconnaissances. During a raid three months ago, his machine was heavily engaged by hostile aircraft. By very judicious management he remained master of the situation, and eventually destroyed one of the enemy machines. During the past month he has again dis-played notable qualities of airmanship whilst encountering large numbers of enemy aircraft. Lieut. Patey is always prepared to carry out any kind of operation entrusted to him, and the spirit he has shown when attacked has been of inestimable value to the squadron.2nd Lieut. Desmond Philip Pogson.In a recent long-distance bombing raid his petrol tank received a shot immediately after crossing the line, but he continued on his journey and bombed the distant objective. On the return journey very fierce fighting occurred, during which both leaders and
Lieut. (T./Capt.) Walter George Preston.This officer has taken part in seventy bombing raids, and has rendered most valu-able service on reconnaissance duty by night. One night he carried out three most suceess-ful bombing raids on hostile rest billets, dropping his bombs and engaging the enemy troops with great effect. He sets an excel-lent example of skill and gallantry.2nd Lieut. Hartly Pullan.This officer has taken part in numerous long-distance bombing raids and recon-naissances. His work has been consistently good. On a recent occasion when on photo-graphic reconnaissance he was attacked by three scouts; he shot one down and the other two dived away. A few minutes later he was again attacked, this time by five tri-planes, one of which he shot down out of control.Lieut. (T./Capt.) John Steele Ralston, M.C. (Scottish Rifles, T.F.).An intrepid patrol leader who in recent operations has accounted for three enemy machines and three kite balloons. Recently while on patrol he advanced to attack a kite balloon; on his approach the balloon party began to haul it down, but forcing home his attack, he shot the balloon down in flames. In the engagement this officer was seriously wounded. Suffering great pain, he flew back to our lines and tried to land, but fainted and crashed.2nd Lieut. Cyril Lancelot Rayment.This officer has taken part in thirty-five successful operations, and his work through-out has been distinguished by clearness, accuracy of observation and disregard of danger, notably on one occasion when he was observer to the leader of our first formation which was vigorously attacked by four hos-tile machines. In spite of this the forma-tion was led over the target, which was effec-tively bombed. Subsequently the formation was attacked by five hostile machines, but owing to skilful leadership the fire of our observers was so well controlled and directed that the enemy were kept at a distance and the formation returned in safety.Lieut. (Hon. Capt.) Robert Redfern (Sea Patrol).A zealous and very able observer who has carried out extremely valuable photographic reconnaissances on enemy country and bases. He has also taken part in many long-distance bombing raids on important ^nemy townsLieut. Indra Lai Roy.A very gallant and determined officer, who in thirteen days accounted for nine enemy machines. In these several engagements he has displayed remarkable skill and daring, on more than one occasion accounting for two machines in one patrol.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Thomas Sydney Sharpe (Glouc. Regt.).A gallant officer who has always led his patrol with marked skill and judgment. On one occasion he chased down an Albatross scout and caused it to crash. He afterwards-attacked five enemy machines, destroying two. On the following day, encountering four Albatross scouts, he engaged one, which crashed. Proceeding on his patrol, he met a formation of enemy scouts; he chased one and destroyed it.Lieut. Richard George Shaw (Sea Patrol).In company with another machine he re-cently attacked seven enemy seaplanes and destroyed one of them. Lieut. Shaw has shown exceptional ability as a flight leader. He has carried out successfully 21 bombing raids, 51 anti-submarine patrols, and has descended to very low altitudes to attack hostile submarines, destroyers and trawlers, scoring at least two direct hits. This officer displays great determination and keenness in his work.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Benjamin James Silly, M.C.For exceptional skill and gallantry on long-distance raids, in 47 of which he has, been engaged, and has been the leader on 22 occasions. Within the past month he led a formation of bombers which accomplished their object notwithstanding that the enemy scouts were encountered almost from the start, and at the destination they numbered 40 machines. Capt. Silly&apos;s formation de-stroyed four enemy aircraft, and returned without losing a single machine.Lieut. Frank Woolley Smith (Notts, k Derby. Regiment, T.F.).&quot;This officer has carried out most valuable work in observing for our artillery from kite balloons. On one occasion his balloon was brought down in flames; his parachute did not open properly, and he fell very rapidly: fortunately, a tree broke his fall and savedLieut. Norman Roberts.This officer has destroyed three enemy machines and driven down two others out of control. He has also distinguished himself in attacking troops at low altitudes, and has carried out valuable reconnaissance service, i Detailed to make a reconnaissance of an im-portant area, he realised, on crossing our lines, that the wind was almost at hurricane strength, and that in face of such a wind his return journey would only be accomplished with extreme difficulty., However, knowing the urgency of his mission, he completed his reconnaissance, penetrating 12 miles behind the enemy lines. On the return journey, owing to the strength of the gale, he was forced to descend to a very low altitude, and was subjected to heavy anti-aircraft and machine-gun fire, which badly damaged his-machine.deputy-leaders of our formations were shot down, and the remaining machines lost touch with each other. At this critical moment 2nd Lieut. Pogson ordered his observer to tie. his handkerchief to the gun-mounting to indicate that his was the leader&apos;s machine. He then circled over the area three times and picked up five of our machines, and in face of very hostile opposition got them into formation and brought them all safely home. The&apos;prompt action of this officer was highly meritorious, and undoubtedly saved the re-maining machines, which could not have coped with the greatly superior formations of the enemy.
him from what seemed certain death. Although badly shaken he volunteered at once to ascend in another balloon. On a later date, when engaged in registration for one of our batteries, his balloon was burnt; after parachuting down, he at once ascended in another balloon and completed his task. The courage and coolness shown by him under these circumstances deserves the highest praise.Lieut. (T./Capt.) William Ernest Staton, M.C.This officer has already been awarded the Military Cross for gallantry and devotion to duty. Since this award he has accounted for eleven enemy aeroplanes nine destroyed and two shot down out of control. He has proved himself a most efficient flight commander and an enterprising leader, setting a very fine example.to his squadron.Lieut. William Samuel Stephenson, M.C.This officer has shown conspicuous gal-lantry and skill in attacking enemy troops and transports from low altitudes, causing heavy casualties. His reports, also, have contained valuable and accurate informa-tion. He has further proved himself a keen antagonist in the air, having, during recent operations, accounted for six enemy aero-planes.Lieut. Earle Richard Stewart.For gallantry and skill as an observer on long-distance bombing raids. During a raid a few months back he was in the deputy-leader^ machine (which usually has to bear the brunt of an attack), and in the course of repelling vigorous enemy attacks he had a breakage in his gun, with the result that he could only fire single shots. In these circumstances he would have been justified in causing his pilot to close up under the re-mainder of the formation, but with great coolness and sound judgment he maintained his place, and thus avoided the risk of im-painng the squadron&apos;s defensive efficiency. By his action he rendered the most valu-able assistance to his formation in holding off the enemy, and by the time the enemy had been dispersed he had fired 200 rounds by single shots with excellent effect. Lieut. Stewart has rendered further distinguished services during the past month, displaying very great ability and absolute fearlessness.Lieut. Harold Waller St. John (Sea Patrol).An intrepid and skilful observer who has rendered most efficient service on reconnais-sance and long-distance bombing raids. He bombed and destroyed an enemy flying boat on one raid, and on another occasion sunk a torpedo boat.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Theodore Quintus Studd ^(Sea Patrol).As pilot he has been engaged in more than 60 successful bombing raids many miles be-hind the enemy&apos;s lines. Captain Studd is a most skilful pilot who can always be relied upon to carry out any task that he may be called upon to perform, no matter what ad-verse conditions may prevail/ jLieut. George Thomson (King&apos;s Own Scot-tish Borderers).A brilliant and intrepid observer in whom his pilot places implicit confidence when on-gaged in action. He has personally accounted for nine enemy machines. On one raid, when acting as escort, 15 enemy aero-planes were encountered; of these this officer shot down two, which crashed, and one out of control.Lieut. Ernest Henry Tredcroft.A cool and courageous observer with marked initiative. He has taken part in 41 successful bomb raids and seven photo-graphic reconnaissances. On one raid, having dropped his bombs on a bridge, he attacked and dispersed with gun fire a num-ber of the enemy on the bank of the river although he had received two severe wounds. On the return journey his machine was at-tacked by five enemy aeroplanes; with great gallantry he drove them off by his fire. He became exhausted by the exertion and severity of his wounds, which caused him to collapse in the machine.Lieut. William Beresford Walker (H.L. Inf.).This officer has taken part in twenty-one bomb raids, and has rendered excellent and valuable service in photography and general observation. He has shown himself a brave and skilful officer in action, notably on one occasion when his formation was attacked by twelve hostile scouts which approached to within short range; he engaged one at 150 yards and drove it down in flames. In another engagement he attacked one enemy aeroplane at close range and drove it down; he then engaged several others with good effect.Capt. Richard Percy vale Ward, M.C. (Royal Welsh Fusiliers).Has been engaged on thirty-seven bombing raids, and on ten photographic reconnais-sances, and has been in nearly all the raids in which severe fighting has taken place. Captain Ward has displayed the greatest coolness and courage in action, combined with ability and keenness in the work en-trusted to him.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Leslie Reginald Warren (late R.N.A.S.).This officer has taken part in forty-six successful raids, fourteen of which he has led. In these operations his formation has only suffered one casualty. This remarkable immunity has been in the main due to his brilliant and skilful leadership; he combines keenness and determination with sound, clear judgment. In addition to raids, he has taken many area photographs, and carried out five long-distance reconnaissances, ren-dering valuable reports.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Eric Waterlow, M.C.This officer has carried, out thirty-three bombing raids and over forty solo photo-&apos; graphic and long-distance reconnaissances far over the enemy lines. In one flight he took no less than 108 photographs.. In these ser-vices he has proved, himself an exceptionally skilful and resolute pilot; his railway recon-naissances have been markedly successful.
Lt. Donald Jayne Waterous.Has been engaged in twenty-six long-distance bombing raids, and has rendered very valuable services, especially during a raid last month when enemy formations were met in great force. Lieut. Waterous dis-plays great keenness and determination in his work, and is always ready to volunteer for any difficult task.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Eric John Webster (Sea Patrol).Has carried out several long-distance re-connaissanees and engaged enemy aircraft who were in superior numbers on many occa-sions. A few months ago he was engaged in a fight, and on the return journey home he had three forced landings. When he reached his base one engine had practically stopped.Lieut. Patrick Eliot Welchman (K.O.S.B.).A gallant, capable and determined leader of long-distance bombing raids. Within the past month he has rendered as deputy-leader very valuable services by resolute co-opera-tion with his leader, and the success attained was in no small degree attributable to the presence of mind and grasp of the situation which this officer displayed. Lieut. Welch-man has taken part in eighteen bombing raids, showing marked ability on all occa-sions.Lieut. George Hedley Welsh.During the last three and a-half months this officer has taken part in seventy-nine bombing raids. Many of these have been carried out by night, and he has displayed conspicuous bravery in descending to low altitudes to successfully attack his objective. One night he carried out four such attacks, exploding a dump and harassing troops on the ground.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Frederick Williams, M.C.Since this officer was awarded the Mili-tary Cross for exceptional leadership of a long-distance bombing raid, he has taken part in twenty-seven successful operations over the lines, ten of which have been photo-graphic reconnaissances. The information he has brought back has been of the greatest value. He is an excellent leader, and a most able instructor. Recently he led a formation to attack an important enemy town. Owing to thick mists and low clouds he was unable to locate his objective. Turning, he suc-ceeded in locating another town, which he bombed with excellent effect, despite heavy hostile anti-aircraft fire.Lieut. Norman Edmundson Williams (Sea Patrol).Was engaged in a long-distance bombing raid on an enemy aircraft station under very difficult circumstances, and carried out a suc-cessful attack from a low height in the face of severe enemy fire.Lieut. (T./Capt.) Clarence Edward Wil-liamson-Jones (Manchester Regiment).This officer has completed over 50 success-ful G.B. shoots, frequently under adverse weather conditions, and in face of severe opposition from aeroplanes and anti-aircraft fire. The success of these operations was in many cases mainly due to his courage andperseverance, On one occasion, flying at 2,000 feet, he held up for a time the advance of hostile infantry.2nd Lieut. (Hon. Capt.) Hugh Brian Wil-son (A.S. Corps). IThis officer has taken part in fourteen long-distance night bomb raids; by descending to low altitudes and directing his machine well over the objective he drops his bombs with great accuracy. On two recent important raids it was entirely due to his skilful observation and resolute determination that the objective was successfully reached and effectively bombed despite unfavourable weather and heavy anti-aircraft fire.Lieut. Joseph Charles Wilson.While on a photographic reconnaissance the rudder controls of this officers machine were shot away. Shortly afterwards he was attacked by three enemy scouts; he handled his damaged machine so skilfully that his observer was enabled to shoot down one out of control, and force the remaining two to retire. He then flew back to his aerodrome, where, owing to his rudder being out of action, he crashed, fracturing both legs and an arm. In all, he has carried out 66 bomb-ing raids, invariably showing fine courage and initiative.Lieut. Walter Albert Yeulett (Sea Patrol).Was engaged in a long-distance bombing raid on an enemy aircraft station, under very difficult circumstances, and carried out a successful attack from a low height in the face of severe enemy fire.Captain John William Boldero Grigson. Lieut. Oswald Robert Gayford (Observer) (Sea Patrol).These two officers have flown together for a period of twelve months, during which time they participated in a number of bomb-ing raids, carried out a large number of valuable reconnaissance patrols and escort flights in all weathers, by day and night, during the performance of which duties they have brought down hostile aircraft on several occasions. No task is too difficult for these officers.Capt. (T./Maj.) Egbert Cadbury, D.S.C. (Pilot).Lieut. (T./Capt.) Robert Leckie, D.S.O., D.S.C. (Observer).Lieut. Ralph Edmund Keys (Pilot) (Sea Patrol).These officers attacked and destroyed a large enemy airship which recently at-tempted a raid on the North-East Coast, and also succeeded in damaging a second air-ship. The services rendered on this occasion were of the greatest value, and the personal risk was very considerable for aeroplanes a long way out from land.AWABDED THE DISTINGUISHED FLYING MEDAL.222763 Sjt.
