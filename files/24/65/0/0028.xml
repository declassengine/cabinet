Prom:.-   War Office.To:-      General Knox, Vladivostok.Desp.   9.15 p.m.   27.9.1918. 67317 cipher.   M.O.5.   September 27th.Reference my 67077 of 24th September,. The provision and despatch to Siberia of such clothing and equipment required for 100,000 men as it is possible for us to provide has been approved of by the war Cabinet. The matter is being dealt with on basis of your No. 52 of 17th September with a view to the earliest possible despatch. We shall be able to send a large part but not all of your requirements.   Details will be sent later. -2.     Reference your No. 38 of 14th September in reply to our representations, French Government place no obstacles in the way of the training by you of the 3,000 Russians on condition it is understood that the organization of Russian forces in Siberia is under Janin and that as soon as new formations are being trained under French leader-ship special force in question shall be drafted into them.To avoid further waste of time you should go ahead with the 3,000 and we will send you out as soon as possible the officers you asked for in your No- 19 of the 6th September.5.     Meanwhile we are representing to the French that so long as efficiency is obtained it is immaterial to us who gets the credit.     Therefore the best practical solution would be (l) for Janin on arrival to proceed to the Urals Immediately, there to assume-the direction of operations on what we hope will prove a new Eastern Front.    (2)   That you acting as an. Inspector General of Communications (a) would do your best to ensure the transmission of tho necessary material to the front and (b) could assist DietrichswithSECRET.Operations *
with the equipment training, organization and despatch of tho Russian reinforcements aAs regards the actual method of obtaining equipment, the formation of an allied board at Vladivostock would, in our opinion, be the best method and through this board all demands for equipment would be passed *.As /regards training, as the French will undoubtedly still like to have a hand; we are proposing that Janin should simply have liaison officers path you and- Dietrions; as far as the remaining French officers are concerned they should be employed by Janin in organizing and directing the operations at the front0
URGENTSECRETFrom:-    General Knox, Vladivostock.To:War Office&apos;bHanded in 2 AO p.m. 14B9cl9180 Received   6*30 a.m, 15*9.1918.38 * Urgent.If Allies delegate my mission to assist in organising a Russian force I propose to work through Dietricks*    He would like to proceed at once to call for volunteers to form an Instructional camp on ? north of islands     Provided the Allies move in sufficient force,(one group undecipherable] Urals he thinks it will be possible by tho Spring to raise named force of one infantry and one Cossack division east of Baikal and 3 Infantry divisions west of Baikal,    He estimates the food, forage, pay and upkeep of such a force at 13,795^000 or at present rate of exchange 306,555 per month.The general Idea is to train the necessary cadre provide equipment and then call up the younger classes *    It is propose that this plan be followed in Eastern Siberia,,Unfortunately   classes have been already called up West Of Baikal.As soon as your sanction has been received we will start (one group undenting a cadre which may reach ? 3,000 officers and men for training here.   . I will then go west and see what help can be given to ? loyalists already in existence beyond Baikal, and it may be possible to render the whole homogeneous by providing pay and ? equipment and a sprinkling of British officers for training at each centre.     Practically all clothing and equipment except rifles must be provided from ? abroad.Politically It is absolutely essential that I should be allowed to start immediately..    The Russians are beginning to lose hope that any.permanent good can arise from allied intervention.     Can I go ahead up to 3,000 men ? I will personally undertake to see that our expenses are kept as low as possible,     If you sanction this I will send you details required for. larger scheme and go west at once if it is sanctionedo? This will be the finest possible propaganda..,
