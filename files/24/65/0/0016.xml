I circulate the following note which has been pre pa rod in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munition industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.STRIKES.Statistics for Week ending the 18th September.During the week ending the 18th September, 1918, 1.6,540 working days-just over one-ninth of 1 per cent, of the possible working time-were lost through strikes by munition workers/&apos;5 The figures are almost identical with those of the previous week, and, as in that week, more than half of the total time was lost by employees at the National Aeroplane Factory, Irleaton Chapel (near Manchester). Work was resumed at Heaton Chapel on the evening of the .17th September. The last month has been a very good one throughout the Munitions industries, and the loss of time through strikes continues to be practically negligible so far as main production is concerned.* For the purpose of these statistics munition workers are taken to include all classes of workers in respect of whom the Ministry of Munitions would intervene in the event of a strike (a) in the munition industries proper (metals, chemicals, and rubber) ; and (b) in certain auxiliary industries, e.&apos;/., iron ore mining, brick making, timber sawing, &quot;certified&quot; gas and electricity undertakings, &amp;c.it,  (33)6G20   Pk50   125   9/18   E&amp;S\% ---LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.   -(25th September 1918.)
