[This Document is the Property ,of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1918.2SECRET.G.T.-5867. ,0THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending the 2nd October, 1918.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.A report is given of the Minister of Labours visit to the armies at the front.Part II: Press Goviments.The opinion of the Labour press on foreign politics,, with special reference to the Inter-allied Labour and Socialist Conference, the League of Nations, and Russia; on home affairs, with special reference to strikes, and on food, is described.Part III: District Reports.The industrial situation has very decidedly improved. The chief centres of unrest at present are the Clyde and South Wales, where the surface workers&apos; demand for an eight-hour day is causing trouble.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. The railway strike and the strike of the Clyde shipwrights have ceased.   No very serious strike is now in progress.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work. The most important dispute at present active, apart from that of the surface workers, is that among the National Amalgamated Union of Engine men, Firemen, Mechanics, and Electrical Workers, who demand increased wages, and threaten to strike on this and other grounds.I.-General Remarks.Report of the Minister of Labours Visit to the Armies.The Minister has addressed a series of Meetings of soldiers at the bases and at the Front.The following is a complete list of the Meetings held : September l5.-Boulogne, Convalescent Dep6t No. 8, Y.M.C.A. Central Hall.,, Paris, Motor Vehicle Repairs Works, Saint Denis and Leave Club.,,     20. Rouen, Reinforcement Camp No. 3, and Theatre.,,     21. Havre, Reinforcement Camp, No. 14, and Crystal Palace.22.-Dieppe, Y.M.C.A. Central Hut; Abbeville Y.M.C.A. Cinema Hut. .,     23.  35th Division and 9th Division in the Field. ,,     24.-2nd Army headquarters, Gassel; Y.M.C.A., St. Omer. ,,     25. Musketry School, Lumbres; Balloon Repair Depot, Arcques. ,,     26. 11th Corps, St. Venant, and Army headquarters 5th Army.His audiences were drawn from all ranks and all units, and varied very considerably according to the places at which the meeting was held. For instance, at Saint Denis he addressed a meeting of the workmen engaged in repairing motor vehicles, nearly all of whom are skilled engineers. At Havre the attendance consisted largely of men at work at the bases in unloading stores, &amp;c, and was therefore drawn largely from the Labour Corps. At the Balloon Repair Dep6t at Arcques, the men were largely skilled men, while in the region of the 2nd and 5th Armies, the men were, of course, almost exclusively drawn from fighting troops.[1100-49] B
Iu his address the Minister outlined the proposals for dealing with demobilisation, and pointed out the need for patience on the part of the men, as it was impossible to bring home everybody immediately, and he emphasized his view that it was better to keep the men rather longer in the army than release them to find themselves unemployed on their return home. This view was generally welcomed by the men themselves. He explained the constitution of the Local Advisory Committees and the part they would play, the proposals for granting a month&apos;s furlough, and&apos;a free out-of-work donation. These proposals were clearly very acceptable to the men, among whom there appeared to be a wide-spread belief that the nation was going to cast them off when they leave the army, and leave them to shift entirely for themselves.The Minister went on to outline some of the steps which had already heen taken towards permanent reconstruction. He explained the working of the Whitley Scheme, the. meaning of the new Trade Boards Act, the new Education Act, and the new Franchise Act; he also referred to the Governments proposals in regard to housing. In all these matters both officers and men were clearly deeply interested, and every audience listened intently throughout.Certain general impressions which were gathered from the tour, and from the way in which the various points made in the Ministers addresses were received, are worth recording.The first is the intense disgust of all ranks with the strikes which have recently taken place. At no point was the applause so vigorous and unanimous in every audience addressed as in response to the Ministers statement that strikes in war time were indefensible.The second point which was very clear was the excellent relations between officers and men, and the strong conviction expressed by officers of all ranks, particularly senior officers, that conditions at home must be better for their men after the war than they have been before. It was evident that the men have learned to respect their officers, and that the latter have come to know and appreciate the lives of their men at home. They have been taught to give every consideration to their comfort in the field, and many of them evidently regard it as their duty to do the same for them at home when the war is over. More than one officer of general rank expressed the view that the soldiers ought to stick together after the war, and work together for the improvement of the country. The atmosphere of unity was very remarkable, and gave the impression that the army when it returns will infuse a new vigour and soundness into our national life.The Commanding Officers in practically every case welcomed the Ministers visit very warmly, and showed by their remarks at the end of his address that they were thoroughly in sympathy with the men&apos;s desire that conditions should be improved after the war. It was evident, however, that although the men were thinking a good deal of the reconstruction question, their thoughts were entirely concentrated on winning the war, and their spirit and confidence was very remarkable.The tour was arranged by the Education Officers now at work throughout the armies, and it was evident that these men are doing excellent work, the importance of which is growing rapidly, It is very necessary that the men in the armies should be fully informed of the problems which await solution after the war, and much good can be done by the co-operation of the Ministry of Labour and the Education department of the War Office with a view to providing full information to the troops abroad. Much can also be done by the Education Officers to assist officers to prepare for their professions after the war, and some regular system of co-operation between them and the Appointments Department of the Ministry of Labour is clearly called for.Altogether there is no doubt that the Ministers visit was thoroughly welcomed, and is likely to have produced good results. He was more than once asked to come out again, and in view of the important part which the army will play in the reconstruction of the country after the war it is very desirable that they should be kept in as close touch as possible with the problems of the future, and the solutions which are being worked out.II. Press Comments. (A.) Military.The Labour and Socialist press makes practically no reference whatever to the military successes and position.
o291(B.) Foreign Politics. The Inter-Allied Labour and Socialist Conference.*The Inter-Allied Conference comes in for a great deal of adverse criticism at the hands of the Labour press the monotony of condemnation being broken only by Mr. Thorne&apos;s evident glee at the isolation of the I.L.P. group in what he regards us a successful Conference. In the opinion of the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; however, the Con-ference was an unfortunate &quot;affair, while the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; regards it as a triumph for reaction, and Robert Williams, in the &quot; Herald,&quot; stigmatises it as an unmitigated farce. &quot; Forward &quot; describes it as a fiasco, and the &quot;Call&quot; speaks of its decisions as being colourless and almost meaningless. The right of the American Federation of Labour to speak for American Labour is denied by the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; and the presence of the American delegates, in view of their intimacy with American and British plutocracy, is regarded as an insult to the international Socialist movement. There is a curious unanimity, however, as to the dominant influence exerted by these rather unwelcome guests. As to the results of the Conference the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; considers (a) that it has made a meeting of the Internationale impossible; (6) that it has strengthened the position of the allied Governments in carrying on the war, and rejecting even- diplomatic opportunity of securing a reasonable peace. It considers, however, that the position will not be tolerated by the rank and file of allied labour or by the majority of Socialists, and that as a result the Socialist Internationale will be reconstituted, with the American E ederation of Labour and the Trades Union Congress definitely excluded. The British Labour Party will only be admitted to membership after giving proof of due repentance.League of Nations.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; congratulates Herr Erzberger on his successful effort to translate the vague ideal of a League of Nations into a series of thoroughly sound and statesmanlike proposals. It is of the opinion, however, that the conception of the book is not wide enough to embrace the big problems which make international action of this sort necessary.Russia.Several papers this week print defences of the Bolshevik Government. The &quot;Herald&quot; condemns America&apos;s appeal to neutral countries and the British threat of outlawry. Mr. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; considers that the British Govern-ment and the Allies are backing the real party of assassination, and that the Bolsheviks, on the contrary, have never sought to obtain their object by the policy of treacherous * assassination. The &quot; Call &quot; considers that the stories of assassination and atrocities are mere inventions of the capitalist press, spread by the Bolsheviks&apos; political opponents.(C.) Home Affairs..Strikes.Opinion on the railway strike, as was to be expected, is divided. The &quot;Herald&quot; and the &quot; Call&quot; consider that it is due to profiteering and war weariness. &quot; Justice &quot; condemns it as a symptom of anarchy, and the &quot;Clarion&quot; quotes with approval Mr. Thomas&apos;s statement that there is a moral obligation on the part Of the people to do nothing which will render victory more difficult.The &quot; Clarion&quot; discusses the measures to be adopted to prevent strikes in the future, and is strongly of opinion that the right to strike should ba restored to the Trade Unions. .     .(D.) Food.Rising Prices.The rise in the price of milk gives an opportunity for an attack on Mr. Clynek, whom &quot;Justice&quot; accuses of getting out of touch with the public. The &quot;Labour Leader &quot; also claims that the allegations that Trade interests are controlling the Food Controller are still unrefuted, and that the increase of 2d. on meat is a concession to the profiteers, as is also the advance in the price of milk.[1100 491 B 2
4National Kitchens,The idea of a widespread increase in the number of National Kitchens has been received in all quarters with alacrity. Criticism, however, is generally levelled at the high rate of profit secured by the National Restaurants, and a contributor to the &quot;Woolwich Pioneer&quot; suggests that the Director of National Kitchens in his next report should make a clear statement as to the methods by which the large profits reported are made. Only so, it is suggested, can he clear himself of the charges of being a profiteer.III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.The situation in the London area is much quieter than last week.A serious agitation is, however, reported to be in progress among the members of the E.T.U. It is said that those employed at the Brompton Road Power Station are about to demand that the whole of the clerical staff shall be compelled to join this Union. A further demand is to be made for a flat rate of 51. for a 50-hours week.Unrest still prevails at Messrs. Berwicks, Park Royal, over the bonus system; while there is expression of a growing desire for a shorter working week.There is considerable unrest among the woodworkers at Whitehead&apos;s (Richmond and Feltham). The men seem to believe that the firm is nearly bankrupt. They are demanding an iucrease of id. per hour, and are dissatisfied with the decisions of the Committee on Production in regard to woodworkers.At Norwich the boot and shoe operatives are agitating for a 25 per cent, advance.West Midlands.With the exception, of disputes at Wednesbury and Hertherton, referred to in Part IV, nothing of importance is reported from this area.Yorkshire and East Midlands.The unrest in this area reported last week has since subsided. The railwaymen in the Leeds district throughout the strike, held by their decision to support the executive oftheN.U.R.At Leeds and Huddersfield the members of the United Garment Workers&apos; Union are renewing their demand for an increase of i\d. per hour, which was first put forward in May. The workers, numbering about 20,000, are mostly women, and are mainly employed on naval and military uniforms.N orih-W esternThe Mersey coalheavers returned to work on the 26th. During the week slight temporary discontent was manifest at Barrow and Lees, but the situation at&apos;present is satisfactory throughout the district. A mass meeting of engineers and shipbuilders was held at Liverpool on the 2yth ; a controversy ensued between John Finnegan and W. M. Citrine on the relative merits of the Mersey Reconstruction Committee and the Trades Federation. Citrine remarked that these two bodies failed to act together, and that advantage of this fact was taken both by employers and by the Govern-ment.   No decision was reached.A demonstration was held at Liverpool on the same day to celebrate the amalgamation of the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, the Workers&apos; Union, and the Municipal Employees5 Association.Northern.With the exception of that of two strikes among Municipal employees, no reports have been received from this district.Wales.The railwaymen decided to return to work on the 25th September. It is reported that the demand for a universal eight hours day is now occasioning serious unrest among the surface workers in the mining districts.
Scotland.The Clyde shipwrights returned to work on the 1st October. It is reported that many of the older men were opposed to the strike, but the fear of being called blacklegs prevented them from continuing at work. The Clyde District Committee of Shipwrights seems to have been responsible for instigating and continuing the strike. The intended strike of joiners and woodworkers has also practically collapsed.General unrest, however, still continues on the Clyde, coal and food difficulties being the main cause of this.There is considerable discontent among the jute workers at Dundee. A demand has been put forward for a forty hours week spread over five days, and for an increase of 11. per week. Although the jute ration has been increased, the men refused to resume full time work on the 28th.IV. Disputes.The general situation is less disturbed this week; the strikes of the railway men and the Clyde shipwrights are at an end, and no further serious stoppages have occurred.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department reports four fresh stoppages for the week ending the 28th September.The Clyde shipwrights returned to work on the 1st October.The blacksmiths and hammermen in. the Leith district (previously erroneously reported as &quot; Leigh &quot;), who ceased work on the 13th September, have now resumed. 1,411 members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers in the Leith district struck work for one day on the 24th September, in protest against the employment of alien labour.  Arrangements to remove the aliens out of this district were made forthwith.The platers&apos; helpers who struck at Messrs. Vickers (Barrow) on the 17th have resumed work pending arbitration.About 10,000 workers employed in the Ipswich Engineering Trades struck on the 26th September. The dispute originated in June last, when various trade unions applied to the Ipswich Engineering Employers&apos; Federation for an alteration in hours and wages. No progress was made with negotiations until the 24th September, when a conference was held. The men complained that they were not fairly treated at the conference, and in consequence came out. Of the men about 500 were employed at the Admiralty &quot;A&quot; firm of Vickers, Ipswich, The dispute has been dealt with by the Ministry of Munitions and Admiralty jointly, and work was resumed unconditionally on the 28th.The Ministry of Munitions reports that only 994 workers were on strike on the 25th September, compared with 1,304 at the end of the previous week.Only one strike of importance is in progress, namely, that of the irondressers, employed in the Dundee shipyards and munition factories, who ceased work on the 23rd as a protest against a recent award of the Committee on Production.The Goal Controller reports thirteen fresh disputes involving stoppages, twelve of which have already been settled.   None was of serious importance.The War Office Contracts Department has no new stoppages to report. The strike at Stevenson and Sons, Lower Tooting, reported last week, has been settled.Reported from other Sources.The majority of the railwaymen had returned to work by the 27th September.The strike at the Welfs Aviation Compaay&apos;fl works, Chelsea, has been settled.The strike at the Mill Close head mines ended on the 30th September.The Holborn street cleaners have been on strike for more than a fortnight in support of their demand for a 11. increase.On the 23rd September the majority of the operatives in the Kettering boot factories struck work against the advice of the Union officials. The strike is due to the failure of the County Arbitration Board to come to a decision regarding their application for a 50 per cent, advance.
6(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department has few eases to report.A strike is threatened among tho carpenters and joiners employed by the Queenstown Dry Dock Company, Belfast, owing to the refusal of the employers to grant a further advance of 3s. (yd. per week.  Negotiations are proceeding.The Ministry of Munitions reports several cases.The employees at the aeroplane propeller factory of Messrs. W. D. Oddy and Co.,. Leeds, have ceased to work overtime xrntil a system of special &quot; ability payments &quot; is abolished. A strike is threatened at the National Aircraft Factory, Aititree, because the Trade Union Executives concerned, namely, those of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet-makers and Joiners, and others, refuse to allow their members to receive payment based on results. The men are satisfied with the system, but one Union (the Furnishing Trades Association) threatens to expel any who work under it. Owing to a shortage of work, forty-six workers were discharged by the Siddeley Deasy Motor Company, Coventry. The other woodworkers employed have decided to work shorter hours, and demand the reinstatement of their fellows.The Coal Controller reports no new cases.The demand of the South Wales surface workers for au eight-hours&apos; day is under consideration. It is a case of peculiar difficulty, as the surface workers are not a party to the Conciliation Board Agreement of 1915, under which present customs ami conditions are to continue until the close of the war.The War Office Contracts Department reports two new cases.The unrest prevailing among the cutters in the London clothing trade has spread to the members of the United Garment Workers&apos; Union. The threatened stoppage is not however likely to take place, since the cutters&apos; application was heard on the 30th September, and that of the tailors will come forward on the 7th October.Reported from other sources.At Messrs. Thorneycroftfs, Woolston, a large number of. men have handed in their notices in connection with the demand for a 20 per cent, bonus. If no arrangement is arrived at a stoppage is likely to occur next week.The tube workers at Wednesbury, Walsall, and Great Bridge, handed in notices . to expire on the 30th September owing to the failure of the employers&apos; and men&apos;s representatives to come to an agreement on the recent demand for a 25 per cent, rise in &apos;. wages.It is reported that the National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen, Mechanics, and Electrical Workers (Bradford and district branches) are demanding that the advance of 3s. Qd. per week plus 12-^ per cent, (approximately 4s. in all) recently granted by the Committee on Production to the Engineering Trades, and which is said to have been conceded&apos; by some of the largest textile manufacturing firms, shall be extended to employees by all firms. They threaten to strike to enforce this demand. It is reported that as soon as this demand is granted a further strike will be threatened by the same men on the question of overtime pay. Yet another threat of a strike is made by the Bradford members, who are engaged mainly at the mills, if the Committee on Production does not return a satisfactory reply to their demand for a 4s. advance.A general strike of the Irish teachers is threatened for the 4th November, if the full Civil Service bonus is not granted to them.The Committee on Production heard sixty-seven cases during last week, forty-seven in London and twenty in Glasgow.These included (1) an application by the Great Eastern Railway Shops Committee for payment of the 12  per cent, and 7^ per cent, bonus to time workers and piece-workers respectivelyj (2) an application by the Hull coopers for an increase of 1.1s. per week; an application by the National Union of General Workers and the Workers&apos; &quot; Union for higher wages to be paid to their members employed in the Scotch Woollen trade.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 197 new differences for the week ending the 28th September. These include a claim on the part of certain workpeople employed in the London newspaper offices for a reduction of working hours from forty-eight to forty-two.G. H. ROBERTS.o
