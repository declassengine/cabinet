(tenalA,lQl.dlrig ,0 clones s.Holbeash.   As a result of more favourable weather the harvest operations have been carried on well, and it is hoped to complete them during the week.Pa^rjj^pjft.    The  arming operations oonsisted of harvesting when weather permitted, ploughing and cutting corn with motor traotor. The arops, produce and stock disposed of during the week inoluded 100 2-shear ewes, 192 eWes, 97 lambs, 8 bulleoks and 10 stone oats.HeathyHi11.    The Wet weather during the week has been adverse to harvest operations, fain having fallen every day.    Eight acres of peas and some 70 acres bf barley have been carried, leaving about 29 aor33 of barloy and some rakings out.    Two fields 6f oats and one of wheat have been threshed.    These have been stacked in the fields, the grain in the roof being in bad condition, grown and damp.    Ten bullocks from the gras3 have been disposed of during the week, the total amount realised being  345. 5. 2.Kelham -Estate, .iArrangements are being made to secure, if possible, the surrender of a lease on the Kelham brick-fi?lds, which expires in 1959.    Sinoe the lease was granted brick-buildings and two cottages have been erected by the lessees, but brick-making has ceased fosr some time.    It is thought that the laud (which is rented at  1 per acre) and the cottages and brick-buildings would bo Useful for estate purposes.    The Estate Committee have also considered the question of the lease of the mineral rights.    The Lessees are in arrea:; with their rent, and a half-year&apos;s rent, namely  1,000, is due to the Society from the date of the acquirement of the estate.    In view 6f the faot that there appears no prospect of obtaining this rent, proceedings are being taken with a view to terminating the lease. Arrangements have been made for etook-taking on the 30th September, bo that results may be obtained as early as possible.Tithe, Copyholdv Commons and Survey Branch.During the paat week four applications for Altered Apportionment, seven for Redemption and one for Merger of tithe rentcharge, and seven for enfranchisement have been received, while six oases of Altered Apportionment, one of Redemption, one of Merger and six of enfranchisement have eeen completed.    In connection with the recent outbreak of Foot-and*Siieuth disease the Branch have examined and revised the Schedule to an Order of the Board issued under the Diseases of Animals Aot defining an extensive area in Kent and East Sussex.Under the Inclosure Aots, 1845 to 1899, an Award has been Issued for the inolooure of the Common Fields in the Parish of Elmstone Hardwicke in the County of Gloucester.    Tho common fields were fifteen in number, having a total area of 628 aor^o.    Eaoh field wa3 owned in separate strips varying in width, the same own-:r pft    often owning numerous strips in the same field.    The stripsbelonging to one and the same owner were not contiguous but were separated by a strip or strips In different ownership.    The only right of common which existed was the right of owners of land in the1.
226oomon fields to turn out cattle on the fields from the time when the corn drops had been harvested until tho lot November in each year. IVrom an agricultural point of viow the system of cultiration of the common fields had many disadvantages.    Owing to the land being owned in noncontiguous strips tho farmers wore obliged to take their teams and ploughs and other implements for considerable distances from one strip to another at great inconvenienoe, and ono farmer1s plough had often to bo turned on the land of another owner.    Contiguous strips were often sown with corn and grass respectively with the tfrvult that the corn became foul with weed,?-.    Effective drainage was also a matter of groat difficulty.    Ac a result of the inoloouro proceedings tho right of common has ceased and the whole of the common fields are now distributed and allotted in oeveralty as separate inclosureo to tho various landownors concerned, with the exception of ten acres which have boon reserved for field gardens, and another ten acres which are to bo used ao a rceraation ground.    The system of roads has also been entirely altered.    One new road has boon constructed, and seme of tho old roads hare been widened, while oth?r old roads have been otopped up.    There is no doubt that the effeot of the inclooure will be very greatly to improve the state of cultivation and to increase materially the production of food from tho 620 acres in question.    For some time after tho outbreak of war, however, the importance of these prttoeedingo, from the point of view of food production, was not apparently fully appreciated, and as a result the valuer took no leas than two and a half yearc to draft his. scheme of inclosure, and no very strong means were taken to bring pressure upon him to complete the matter.    The dfcaft ocheme was not ; received until shortly after the Tithe, Conmons, Copyhold and Survey Branch was re*organised last summer.    When the draft scheme and the relative map were examined numerous errors both of detail and of principle were discovered and a long correspondence and ultimately an interview on the 24th May last were required to reduce the documents to order.     Strong representations were received from the Gloucester-shire Agricultural Executive Committee a few months ago to the effect that the greater part of the common was practically uncultivated and that in the interests of food production the proceedings should be completed at the earliest ponsible date.    The statutory meeting for considering objections to the draft scheme was held on the 2nd August last bfr the Board1s Assistant Commissioner who determined adversely to all except that lodged by the Cheltenham Corporation.    With a view to reconciling the conflicting interests involved in this objection at the earliest possible moment an informal meeting was held at Cheltenham which was attended by the Mayor, Tern Clerk, and other persons concerned.    At this meeting agreements were entered into \7hich made ponsible the completion of the case.Flax Production Branch.The harvesting of the urop is now completed in all areas, and the stacking and thatching well advanced.    Delay and some loss , have occurred in one district near Selby owing tt the floods consequent on the breaking of the river Toank.    Apart from this and a certain number of fields badly laid by the excessive rainfalls, the crop has &quot;been got in in fair condition.    About 150 acres of inferior crop were cut by machine to avoid delay and expense of hand pulling.    Work on the Deseeding Stations is being pressed forward and in two eases trial rune of the machinery have taken place.    The majority of the Stations should be at work within the next month. -tftint, Oemmittee of the Board of Agriculture and. &quot;      Fisheries and The Ministry of &quot;flood.Prom reports received from some of the-County Representa-tives, it is evident that the resent concession as to the use of straw for bedding and other purposes has given general satisfaction2.
227It is also becoming increasingly evident that the high prioe, scarcity and general inferiority of meals offered to the keepers of (% small livestock is encouraging, to an undesirable extent, the temptation to use for this purpose feeding stuffs intended primarily for human consumption,l&apos;he widespread discontent as to ths feeding stuff situation still finds strong expression.     It is anticipated, however, that the revised arrangements made by &quot;the Ministry of flood vvith regard to distribution will go far towards relieving this situation.Publications Branch.The number of applications for ordinary issues of the leaflets was 679, in response to which 2,878 oopi^s of leaflets were despatched.    In addition 10.250 copies of leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.    During the -reek Women13 Land Army Leaflet No. 1 (The Oare of Cows and Calves) was issued.Ordnance Survey.-During the week ended 2nd October 1918, maps were despatch&apos;.5d as followsWar Office 7,954 Air Ministry 4,365 Admiralty 16,135 U.S. Air fforos 1,400 Overseas 121,726 Other Services    468A draft of men (Royal Engineers) was 3ent to Egypt.Diseases of -Animals Branch.Th-^re has unfortunately been a case of Eoot-and-Mouth Disease confirmed in Sussex; the usual precautions hare been taken and so far no further outbreak has occurred.    Sight more cases of Rabies have been confirmed, two of them being outside the area of Plymouth, namely, one at Powey and one at Kodbury.    The Fowey case made an extension of the restrictions as to muzzling desirable and the whole of Cornwall with the exoeption of a small area near Bude is ;! subject to these restrictions.Kaheries Division.Administrative Section. There are signs of unrest anicngct fishermen with - regard to wages, proposed reduction of price of fish etc., and at twoports a strike was threatened.    The matter is receiving carefulattention.Enquiries are being received from fishermen and others as to tha possibility of obtaining some compensation ou compassionate grant in respect of boats and gear laid up and deteriorating on account of the owners having been tailed up for service.    The question is retciving attention, though it is feared that no relief a an be afforded from Stats Funds.Permit Section.      61 permits have been issued to fishing Tassels an4 52 oanoellod.    A staam trawler ha3 br.:n blown up by a min-;.    All hands wore savyd.Hotor Loan Committee. The number of installations completed during September, irrespedtive of those in th-s S.W. Area of which reports hare yet to be received,       four, while six more &quot;were taken in hand, certain of which will be completed very shortly.    The railway strike,3.
though only lasting a fe*j days, seriously hampered the Committee&apos;s Hork in one or tvvo localities;   supplies of materials were delayed and the etrlke is likely also to ro-act on deliveries of engines. The Committees mechanics have bo.3n much in demand at the various ports at which thsy are working to carry out small repairs and adjustments, and have in many oases saved considerable time for vessels &apos;.n which they have worked.Jish 5* cod Ccmmittflo.    Complaints having been received of the difficulty exporiincod by professional &quot;ild f ov;lere in obtaining supplies of shot for &quot;punt guns&quot;, the Committee havo arranged through the Ministry of Joed for adequate supplies tc be obtained unddr a system of permits to be issued to retailers tc obtain shct etc. from manufacturers and tc v;ild-fewlers to obtain supplies,from the retailers.    Supplies of caps, anvils and cartridge cases are also boing arranged.Complaints have been received frcm various parts of the coast of the difficulty of obtaining coal for fishing vessels and these complaints, in most cases, have been satisfactorily dela-lt vrith through th3 Coal Controller.Tho normal work of tho Board proceeds on linss indicated in previous reports.4th October. 1913.Ssoretary.
