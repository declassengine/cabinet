]IThh Document, is the Property or - &apos;^.MAN   POWER   AND   AIR POWER. &quot; 83In view of the urgent necessity of deciding on the -allocation-of man power for 1919, and of probable discussions in the War Cabinet on this subject, also the Memorandum N.S.R. 46 by the Minister of National Service, I desire to put certain views before the Cabinet as affecting the Royal Air Force,In proper order -i have submitted memoranda dealing with tho responsibility of the Air Ministry, the strategical air policy, the requirements- in materiel and man power, the development and allocation programme to. September 30th,1910, of air strength as between the Armies,- Navy and the Independent Force,     Generally, these have been approved in each ease by the War Cabinet, and the different component parts of the programme are well   in hand and are being carried-out subject only to delays of a normal character.The two most indefinite factors are the allocation of man.power and the fulfilment of materiel demands by the Ministry of Munitions.    As regards the latter point, the chief item of an indefinite nature is the supply of Liberty motors from America. -.,    Since this programme of Aircraft Development to September 30th, 1919,&quot;and the strategical policy on which it was based, were put forward, the general war situation has greatly changed.     I have disoussed this question with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and there would appear to be a consonance of view that the correct policy now to acfopt in all phases of war activity should be a concentration of effort aiming at achieving our maximum offensive power not later than the end of September, 1919. In other words, we should in all branches of war activity largely discount 1920, particularly in cases where by   so doing we will materially help and intensify our position for offenoe for 1919.This view is also well represented by the Minister of Munitions in his Memorandum G.T.5626, with which I am practically in complete agreement.On the other hand, careful consideration of Memorandum No.46 of the Minister of National Service discloses an entirely different view a3 to policy and action. Y/hereas Mr. Churchill presses for the strong offensive policy in 1919, Sir Auckland Geddes emphasises the importance of concentration on defence against submarines\ while he particularly refers to an alleged inadequate provision of anti-submarine aircraft.     The aviation programme, as a matter of fact, provides for a most substantial increase in the provision of anti-submarine aircraft, and I cannot see the justification for any increase without some further disclosure of new facts by the Admiralty.      One point is however, at least clear, namely, that the apportionment of industrial strength and man power already involved in these protective measures is very heavy.I cannot but believe that the former of these two policies is, in the greatly altered military situation in which we now find ourselres, the correct ,&apos;bne to pursue, but before outlining the steps which I consider should be taken in order to bring the Royal Air Force development into
harmony with this policy I should like to make a few observations in dtteil as regards points raised in both Mr, Ghurohillf0 and Sir Auckland Geddes1 memoranda.As regards tho first of these, namely, G.T.5626, paragraph 2 (d), I presume the Minister of Munitions propoA to safeguard the supply of aeronautical materiel before    y agreeing to the release of man power, otherwise the release of men will be valueless without the materiel.The point raised in paragraph (h) rogarding aircraf for home defence has already received attention from the Air Ministry and is fully appreciated.    Even at present, the Home Defence Brigade is providing certain squadrons for overseas work and makes a substantial contribution towards the training of  pilots, while tho possibility of the use o, the whole Brigade overseas for any climax or emergency is fully realised.Further with, regard to this paragraph, I am not pre to agree that any substantial curtailment can take place in training, aa our recent&quot;experience shews that the thorough! well trained pilot is really essential.Dealing now with N.S.R. 46 as regards the definite supply of man power for the Air Force, tho provision of skilled men has always threatened to be the limiting factor of aerial expansion, but up to the present time, tho limitations in materiel supply have enabled our resources in skilled personnel to keep level with the development of new units.     The situation has now changed, and the weakest part of our development programme probably lies in the quantity and quality of the men passing into tho ranks of th1 Royal Air Force.I desire to emphasise the following factorss-(l) The quality and technical attainments of the so-called skilled men enlisted aro very-much lower than formerly, while tho 6&apos;tandard of intelligence of the unskilled men enlisted is oo poor that few,.of them are capable of being trained rapidly and satisfactorily as tradesmen.(2) It has been impossible through difficulties of organisation, and, la particular, through shortage of accommodation,&apos; to make full &apos;Use of, women to replace men.! Up to the present the Ministry.of National Service ha provided practically the total number of-men required, with tho exception of an extra demand of 7,000 during July,   On th othor hand, the requirements in certain of. the more skilled trades have not been met and a proportion of the unskilled men has been practically useless ;on account of their very low standard of physique and&apos; intelligence,.so much so that It has been difficult to find miscellaneous labour fit for service abroad, although on paper a surplus of this labour, so far as&apos; numbers are concerned, exiuis*    This situation Is, however,, improving.- Sir Auckland Geddes in his paper points out certain apparent Inconsistencies and absurdities in connection with the demands put forward to him by the Royal Air Force, but his views aro largely based on misunderstandings.    For example, tho requirements put forward for September, 1918, have boon multiplied by him by nine, regardless of the fact that outstanding deficienciec were included in the September demand, and as those deficiencies are naturally greatest in the rarer trades, the national Service figures shew most
alarming domands on trades in which there is a &quot;great shortage in the country, while at the same time they shew a misleading Idea of the actual requirements of the Royal Air Force in those trades.      As a matter of fact, the monthly schedules put forward are submitted for guidance purposes and to help National Service to provide men who, from their present experience., would most readily be trained to carry out the work required.     The schedule shews for what trades we intend to train and employ the &quot;men and National Service are asked to provide as many as possible of each trade required and to make up the inevitably large deficiency with raw material susceptible of education.At present the output from Royal Air Force training institutions of men trained from either raw material, or Individuals with very slight technical qualifications, is as follows, taking the five trades as examples in which the shortage Is most difficult to fill:-Fittors.......................... 1200 per month.Sheet metal workers (includingcopper and tinsmiths) ............    70   M      &quot;Riggers &amp; carpenters ....   ....... 1200   &quot;      &quot;Instrument repairers.............    30   &quot;      &quot;Camera repairers .................     20   &quot;      &quot;The intake through the Ministry of National Service ;,of men of sufficient skiil in these same trades to be sent direct to units&quot;without training has averaged&apos;during the past three month as follows.-...    ......Fitters.......................... 500 per monthSheet metal workers (includingcopper and tinsmiths) .............   70   &quot;      &quot;Riggers and carpenters ........... - nil   &quot;      &quot;Instrument repairers............. 130   &quot;      &quot;Camera repairers ................. nil   11      &quot;-&quot;Many of these men have very slender trade qualifications, and for some .months the bulk of them are really under training in their units and can hardly be reckoned as efficient, although they count In full against the establishment necessary to maintain the equipment of those units.In particular, the instrument repairers were of very bad quality, and should have gone, through a course&apos;of instruction;   they had just sufficient knowledge, however, to justify their direct despatch to units in view of the very serious deficiencies then existing.I thoroughly agree with Sir Auckland Goddes when he points out that we must not take men frwi civil life who are providing aeronautical materiel and thus break down our materiel supply, and the most careful.balancing will be necessary in the solution of this problem.The different departments of the Air Ministry are at present engaged in taking steps to economise the use of skilled labour In the following directions:-m   3   m
(a) Revision of establishments of training, service and technical units, involving possibly the almost total abandonment of aeroplane repairs and a still greater employment of women tharc previously oontemplatl together with the provision of increased facilities for their accommodation;   the increased use of German prisoners on repairs to motor transport.(b) By taking vigorous measures to ensure that men belonging to the trades where the shortage is most difficult to fill, are employed, and fully employed, on no other work but that connected with those trades.(c) More intense development of technical training facilities.  &apos; &apos;    &apos;The intelligent development of these measures for economising labour will operate gradually, and it is impose to define at the moment&apos; the exact results which may be look! for, and accordingly, it is impossible to make a definite schedule of the future man power requirements.To return.now to the specific part which, under the; conditions,&apos;the Royal Air Force should take in the general policy of concentrating upon a maximum offensive effort by the Autumn of noxt year, I have the following recommendatioi to make with a view to accelerating the programme of development in&quot;materiel and man power(i),That theefforts of the Air Ministry should be centred upon the provision of the maximum number of squadrons possible by the 30th June,,1919, and that the building programme, training facilities, technical depots and stores, as well as(the material programme in association&apos;with the Minister of Munitions, should be closely reviewed and accelerated to that end.    Preparatit for further expansion.beyond this date should be postponei for later Consideration.(ii)- That&apos;the allocation of ,the squadrons in such a programme be drawn up on a basis, of their primary application to offensive measures, so far as is possibleand justifiable, and.thereby conform to the general warpolicy for 1919.1    &apos;   /(iii) That with this policy in view the Minister of National Service shall supply men to&quot;the Royal Air Force at the rate of 12,000 per month for the last 4 months in 1918,, and of 6,000 afmonth in 1919&apos; up to a total of 72,000 men in all, it being understood that if as a resul! of the measures above outlined a smaller number of men are required, that the demand on the Ministry of National Service shall be at.once reduced.A statement of the programme revised in accordance with the policy herein recommended, will be submitted to the War Cabinet as soon as possible.25.9.18.
