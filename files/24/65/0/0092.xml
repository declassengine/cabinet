On the 18th July, 1918,the Army Council laid down aPolicy for railway construction in Mesopotamia.On the 30th July, 1918, the Commander-in-Chiof, India, in referring to this policy, informed the War Office that India&apos;a military requirements would absorb all the rails that India could produce up to the 31st December, 1918, and after that date India could spare half the rollings only for use outside India and Eastern Persia.     The War Office questioned this decision, for a telegram dated the 25th June, 1917, from the India Office to the Viceroy, India, definitely arranged that War Office is responsible for the allocation of the output of rails by India (i.e. from Tata&apos;s works land will correspond on the subject direct with the   . Commander-in-Chief, India, and up to date the allocation of India&apos;s output of rails has been made accordingly to this agreement.   It was on this basis that the railway policy for Mesopotamia was framed in July last.On the 12th August, however, tho Connehdsr-in-Chief, India, quoted in support of his contention a telegram dated the 20th July, 1916, from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy, India, in which it was dirocted that requirements for maintenance Of the defence of India were to take priority of those of Mesopotamia.     The question was then referred by the Army Council to the Secretary of State for India, who, after consults-tion with the Viceroy, replied that he agreed with the attitude adopted by the Government of India.2c The strategic situation in the eyes of the Army Councildoes not warrant the demand for rails for use in India and in Eastern.

270COHTItOl.

June,, 1917, definitely conferred this authority on the War Office,.I am to observe that Mr.Montagu is. unable to agree that the telegram referred to can be so interpreted.   Its import was much more limited.,    In 1917 the Government of India had taken steps to increase the manufacture in India of rails and othca munitions to ineot more fully from, Indian sources their own requirements and to provide a surplus which would be at the disposal of the Ministry of Munitions and the War Office.   Some uncertainty arose as to the channel through which the require-ments of the home Government should be made known to the Indian authorities,, and this question was referred to the India Office by the Government of India.    After consulting the War Office and the Ministry of Munitions, Mr.Secretary Chamberlain decided in conformity with their wishes, that, as the Ministry of Munitions was responsible for the supply of railway materials and the War Office for allocation and shipment, the former department should correspond with the Government of India through the India Office regarding manufacture and supply, and the latter direct with the Commander-in-Chief as to allocation and shipment.     This is the still existing arrangement.    But under it the War Office no more has power to dispose of the whole output of rails in India and allocate it to places beyond seas without regard to the civil and military requirements of the Government of India than it has to dispose of troops on the Indian establishment and send them out of India without the permission of the Indian Government.Mr,Montagu feels it his duty to make clear the uncuestion-ablo rights of the Indian Government in this matter, as a question of first principles is involved.    But he fully recognises the vital importance of subordinating in the greatest possible degree during the war the civil and military needs of India, as regards not only rails end munitions but also men and materiel of all kinds, to the requirements of other theatres of war, and he is at all times anxious that the Government of India and its military advisers should in their dispositions for the defence of India be guided by the advice of the War Office and conform to the general strategic policy indicated to them.   In the particular matter of the allocation of the output of the Tata -Steel and Iron Works during the next few months, Hr.Montegu, in forwarding to the War Office a telegram x from the Government( zSee M.37589 of 24th Sept. 1918.)
k       271.of Indie explaining that on full consideration of their essential needs they required Tata&apos;s output up to the end of December, stated that as at present advised ho was in agree-ment with the Vioeroy.    He is preparod to aslc the Indian Government to.reconsider the matter if the Army Council will furnish him with a reasoned statement which he can lay before them;   and he is inclined to think the matter should be capable of accommodation.    But on constitutional grounds he must demur to the olaim advanced in the Memo, submitted by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to tho Army Council.I have the honour to be, Sir.Your obedient Servant,(signed)   T. V.. Holderness.rfhe Secretary,WAK OFFICE.
