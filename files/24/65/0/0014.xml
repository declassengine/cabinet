We are Informing then that we can-not officially recognise their Agreement with Germany and that wo pre-for to make no comment upon this arrangement;   we ehall not, however, interfere with Norwegian shipping unless we have reason to believe that the Agreement with Germany is operating in a way calculated to deprive Norwegian vessels of thoir neutral character.SWEDEN.   Tho United States Minister at Stockholm presented tho protest of his Government against the recent exports from Sweden to Germany in breach of the new Swedish Agreement (Summary: Sept.13-19) on September EOth.    Tho Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs intimated that he was ready to comply with the request of the United States for a statement of Swedish exports to Germany since tho Axaerioan-Swedieh Agreement was signed and of the outstanding Swedish commitments.   He said that the Swedish Government could not comply with the United States demand for copies of all Agreements between Sweden and Germany concerning Swedish exports.    He implied that the Agreement with Germany under which the recent exporta took place was the only existing Agreement of its kind.JSIl^HIHXAifjDS.

The rebent reorganising of the Italian Blockade administration does not appear to be very satisfactory.    The new Italian Blockade Committee will not control the issue of export licences and the varioust Mini stories whose blockade activities the Committee io intended to coor-.dinate will remain largely independent.    Tho chief powers continue to . lie with tho Ministry of Finance (Licensing Committee) and the Ministry of Commerce (Blacklisting and Enemy Trading Laws).
