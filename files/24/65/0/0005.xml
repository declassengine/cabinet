is Document is the Pfop^tNuoij/^ticK2P0RT relating to the War Work of the 3oard of Agricultureor Scotland for the week ending .25th September 1018.-^  21POOD PRODUCTION.The weather has been unfavourable for the grain harvest during the past week, and little progress has been made, the heavy rains and high winds having impeded both the cutting and carrying of the crops.     In parts of the northern Counties, particularly Aberdeenshire, the grain crops which are very heavy have&apos;,&quot;been much laid and twisted, and in many case3, it is being found impossible to use either a binder or a reaper,1 *   Pistriot Agricultural ^ecutive Committees.Following on the general instructions issued by the Board for the maintenance of the present acreage of plough-red land as a iiiniitum during 1919, the Agricultural Commit-:teea have begun to consider detailed schemes for next year&apos;s cropping.     Little progress in this direction-can, howovor, be&apos; made until the harvest has been secured. &apos; The time of the members is absorbed in this work and few meetings are consequently being convened in the meantime.2*   Prosecutions;.&apos; &apos;As reported last week convictions had been obtained at that date in eight cases of farmers who had failed to comply wrth the terms of Orders issued, by the Board under Regulation 2M.   A further case falls to be added, viz:-Hame of Farm. -      nature of Charge. .. Result of Prosecutionllaggiefauld, Ion-compliance ,-with Defendant fined - 5. Perthshire Order under 2M (l)(e)ordering increased -*cultivation.It may be added that in all prosecutions for centra-rvention of Compulsory Orders,issued by the Board under Defence of the Realm Regulati-ono convictions have been obtained.3*   Supplies for Agricultural Purposes. f(a) Threshing ffacilities. *The- Board have been in communication with the Forage Department of the War Office (Scottish Command) with a view to obtaining the release of engines, belonging to private threshing mill owners, which aro at present being used by that Department.     There i3 a considerable shortage of threshing outfits in Scotland,and unless the engines in question, are made available to assist in the threshing operations this season, the position will shortly become serious.     The Forage Department have indicated! that there is no Immediate prospect of these machines being released. The / ,     . .   &quot; \
The Board have put the, matter before &quot;the&quot; Forage Advisory Committ , ,with a re-quest that the engines should be returned to their owns as soon as possible.(b)  &apos;gaie -of Horses Order..During&quot;the week 1008 licences to sell horses were issue to farmers. The oonsiderabie increase in the number over previo weeks is due to the Autumn Sales. The total number of licences issued to date is 37,683. . , , &apos; [\(o)   Labour for Harvest Work.The Board have had under consideration the exceptional position, with regard to the harvest, of crofters in the North and West of Scotland.    The orofts are too small to pay for the services of 3oldiers allocated for harvest work and in any case no accommodation is available for such auxiliary labour.   Conse-tojiently, the only labour that can be utilised is that of relati serving with the Forces.   The Board therefore approached the Arm Council with a view to obtaining harvest leave for crofters sen with the Army.   They have now been informed by the Scottish Com that instructions have been issued that.a fortnights agrioultur leave may be granted to crofters serving in units under that v Command.   Intimation of this concession has been made to Agricultural Executive Committees in crofting districts.      The , War Office have also agreed to consider applications for the release of crofters serving in France.4.
