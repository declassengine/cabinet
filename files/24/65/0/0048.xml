E C    ST.ARC A S, I IT.I1.-5848.LOAN CP TAJIK V*AGOITS TO FKAUCH,Translation of telegram from j.,;,. Clemcnceau to ?rr. Lloya &quot;George.Paris.VERY. URGIilHT.28th September, 1918,To:- lir. Lloyd George.I am informed that the Resolution of the Inter-Allied Conference that England should immediately lend to iiranoe 200 tank wagons while awaiting the delivery by British manufacturers of the seme amount of raw material ordered by the Srench petrol Trade, is to be submitted to the wax Cabinet for decision.   I strongly urge a favourable decision on your part, followed by immediate execution with regard to this matter.The victorious offensive of the Allies requires, for its continued success, delivery of ever-increosing supplies to the Armies.   The quantities asked for by the Com^nder-in-Chief since the month of July have surpassed all estimates., and, by reason of the very small number of tank wagons which prance is able to produce, it has not been possible to make regular deliveries.     If the present situation continues it might possibly imperil the whole campaign, I urge, therefore, that the 200 wagons be sent without delay to France to be placed at the disposal of the Army Supply Department.2, Whitehall Gardens, s.W.1st October, 1918.
