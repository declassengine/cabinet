[This Document is the Property of His Britannic M^esty&apos;s fioTemment.]56Printed for the War Cabinet.  September 1918.SECRET.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION -No. 70. Week ended 21st September, 1918.NAVAL OPEKATIONS.Minelaying in the North Sea has been continued. North Sea.On 16th September four of our machines from Felixstowe engaged five enemy aircraft 12 miles East of Ship wash Light Vessel. One enemy machine was set on lire and destroyed. The remaining four enemy machines retired to the Eastward, and were chased by a machine from Covehithe which, however, was unable to overtake them.Aerial activity has&quot; been restricted by unfavourable weather, but R.A.F. machines Flanders from Dunkirk, working with the Navy, have carried out the following raids on the Belgian Area, coast: Date.September. 15th15th.-J.6tJi16th17th18th 20thObjective.Approximate weight of bombs dropped.Uytkerke Aerodrome       ......Bruges Docks............Ghistelles Aerodrome, &amp;c.......Bruges Docks and Enemy Aero-dromesMaria Alter Aerodrome     ......Bruges Docks............Bruges Docks............Engel Dump and Aerodrome, &amp;c...

A fire started in dock.1*2l  Tons. -Bursts observed in entrance to dock, and 11 bursts on quay.On 15th September an enemy destroyer was attacked by aircraft off Zeebrugge Mole, several bombs falling very near to her.In the course of aerial fighting during the above raids 20 enemy machines were destroyed and 15 driven down out of control.  Seven of our machines are missing.On 17th September 14 of our machines carried out a raid on Durazzo, the total weight Mediter-Kf bombs dropped being about 2  tons.  Direct hits were obtained on the seaplane base, ranean. railway sidings and on the new aerodrome, and several fires were started.  All our machines returned safely with the exception of one which came down in the sea and was lost, the crew, however, being rescued by an Italian destroyer.On 18th September the destroyer &quot; Forester &quot; shelled a small detached body of enemy troops 30 miles north of Jaffa.(01406)   Wt.  -  50   9/18   fl &amp; S A
Two of our machines left Mudros on the night of 20th September to carry out a bombing raid on Constantinople. One machine returned owing to engine trouble. The second machine reached Constantinople and dropped two 65-lb. and eight 16-lb. bombs, one of the large bombs dropping in Haidar Pasha station and the other on. buildings north of the Admiralty. Two of the smaller bombs were seen to burst in Stambul, but observation was hampered by heavy, though inaccurate, anti-aircraft fire. Pamphlets were also dropped in Stambul.On the night of 21st September Nagara was bombed by two Greek machines, and a seaplane hangar is believed to have been damaged.   One machine failed to return.Casualties. On 16th September, in Dover Harbour, a serious explosion occurred amidships on board the monitor &quot; Glatton,&quot; this being followed by a fire of oil fuel. Efforts were made for l\ hours to extinguish the fire but without success, and, as the after magazine could not be flooded by reason of the impossibility of approach owing to flames, the ship was sunk by torpedo.One officer and 19 men were killed by the explosion and 57 men are missing, presumed killed.On 22nd September the armed trawler &quot; Elise &quot; was blown up, and is presumed to have been torpedoed, 2j miles from Blyth.  The crew were lost.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines The number of large enemy submarines of a type which operates further afield than the operating. North Sea, which were located during the week, was 20, including five of the &quot; cruiser &quot; type. Of these latter two were on passage to the Atlantic Coast of North America, one operating of? Nova Scotia, one off the Azores and one in the North Sea, homeward bound. Activity during the week has in most areas been comparatively slight owing to a succession of gales, but in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel area, particularly off the North Cornish coast, activity was intense. A submarine did considerable damage in Lyme Bay also, but it is hoped that it was destroyed in the Start Point minefield on the 21st instant when two lines of mines were fired, and witnesses state that they saw the bows of a submarine in the second explosion. It is significant that activity in the Lyme Bay area abruptly ceased after the occurrence.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions between Allied craft and enemywith enemy submarines which are reported to have taken place in all waters during recent weeks submarines. an(j ^e nature of the craft which have been engaged ; and also the number of submarines which have been destroyed or lost to the enemy as the result of such actions : .

ENEMY MINES.The only enemy minelaying activity to record for the week under review took place Minelaying. in the Peterhead area, where further mines were laid&apos; by the submarine which had laid mines off Aberdeen in the previous week.  The mines laid off Peterhead were scattered unusually widely apart.The following Table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed in British mine- Casualties, sweeping areas and of British vessels sunk by mine in recent weeks :-	Number of Enemy		*		Moored Mines			Week Ended.

No enemy ships have entered or left men. Rotterdam, but one enemy vessel arrived at Harlingen from the Khine.FOREIGN NAVAL&apos; INTELLIGENCE. France.On 8th September the destroyer &quot; Pierrier &quot; bombarded the East Jetty at Beirut without result. On .10th September the same destroyer and the &quot; Coutelas &quot; again bombarded this jetty and are reported to have sunk a schooner in the Port. On this occasion they were attacked by an aeroplane, which, however, was driven off. The same destroyers subsequently fired on the submarine base at Tripoli without reply.It is feared that the Submarine &quot; Circe &quot; was sunk by torpedo off Cape Rodoni on 20th September.Italy. .On September 5th an engagement took place in the Gulf of Drin between Italian seaplanes and three Austrian torpedo boats, in the course of which one seaplane was brought down by enemy fire. A division of Italian destroyers which had been warned of the presence of enemy craft, shortly afterwards appeared and opened fire on the enemy, who retired to San Giovanni di Medua. The Austrians have admitted the loss of Torpedo Boat No. 76 in this action.Spain.No agreement has yet been reached with Germany on the question of the sinking of Spanish ships, but it is probable that a compromise will be reached.
Russia.In the last report received from Captain Cromie it is stated that the feeling in the (Baltic Fleet had inclined against the bolsheviks and Germans, and that anti-German propaganda was showing wide results in Estfionia aud Livonia.Tl^e decision of the Archangel Government to resign has not yet been confirmed. General Poole telegraphed on the 10th September that the road is now open from Onega to Oboserskaya, where an enemy aeroplane has been brought down. Our naval forces have been successful in sinking two enemy gunboats on the Northern Dvina which has been mined by the enemy.It is reported from Murmansk that Ukhta was captured by a Karelian battalion on 17th September with considerable quantities of warlike stores, the enemy losing heavily and retreating in disorder across the frontier.The Russian wireless reported on 12th September that the Government has now officially recognised the independence of the Crimea.Baku was evacuated successfully on the night of the 14th instant, after our troops had held the Turks through 16 hours continuous fighting. The Caspian fleet, which is short of ammunition, has thereby lost its base. Commodore Norris has about 20 merchant ships at Enzeli, some of which he hopes to arm shortly for service on the Caspian, and there is ample fuel available at Enzeli and Krasnovodsk. Great importance is attached to our retention of Krasnovodsk and the control of the Caspian shipping. The Bolsheviks are reported to have armed five steamers at Astrachan.Seventeen ships have been captured by Japanese naval forces at Nikolaevsk-on-Amur, and Japanese destroyers are operating up the river. The Japanese entered Blagovestchensk on the 20th September.General Gaida, claims to command all Russian as well as Czech troops, and martial law has been proclaimed in Vladivostok and throughout the Maritime Province.Naval Staff.mh September, 1918.f Appendix.
