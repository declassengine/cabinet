L 123,1.1., i T&apos; V,,. V..-(This document is the property.of His Majesty&apos;s Britannic..Government)WAR      CABINET.,5837. I1ET. A   STATUTORY   ANNUAL   HOLIDAY.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.(1)     The Civil War Workers Committee has presented to me a Report on the subject of holidays for munition workers after the War. A proposal was made by a group of members of the Committee that on the analogy of the month&apos;s furlough to be granted to soldiers on demobilisation, all munition workers should be grantasd a month&apos;a holiday on full pay (at weekly time wages) at the cost of the State.   The,reasons and arguments adduced by the majority of the Committee against this course I regard as irrefutable.   The majority, however, throw out the suggestion that &quot;the whole question of holidays might well be considered by the Government as a general measure for tho improvement of industrial conditions&quot;- and certain mombers of the Committee strongly support the proposal made by a well known employer, Mr. VI.L.Hichens, in evidence before the Committee that all weekly wage earners should be given a fortnight&apos;s-holiday on full pay each year.The Interim Report of the Adult Education Committee on industrial and social conditions in relation to Adult Education, also recommends the establishment of a statutory annual holiday with pay.(2)     In another memorandum (G-T*5838) I have emphasised the needfor /
t -for a bold and comprehensive Industrial policy for after the war, and amongst the measures suggested was an annual holiday with pay.   I am of opinion that from tho national point of view, whether one has regard to health.,, contentment or industrial effioiendy, that the proposal is one cf groat value; and I hope the Ylar Cabinet will pronounce in favour of it.3)   I would point out that legal provision is made for holidays, so far as protected persons aro concerned, in the Factory, Mines and Shops Acts.   Hitherto legislation has been directed ratber to the prohibition of Sunday employment and to the Saturday half-holiday, though the Factory Act requires that six $ays holiday per year shall be givon to childron, young persons and women (which days in England are normally Christmas Day, Good Friday, and four Bank Holidays).   The Shops Aots, howevor, proceed further. The Act of 1912 provides for the suspension for a period or periods net exceeding four months in any year of tho obligation to give a weekly half holiday to shop assistants, provided that they received &quot;a holiday on full pay of not less than two weeks in every year&quot;. Tht Shops Act 1913 also provides that Soction I of the Shops Act 1912 (relating to a weekly half-holiday) shall not apply to shop assistants employod in any premises for tho sale of   refreshments, if specifiod alternative arrangemonts are made, one of which Is that &quot;a holiday on full pay of not loss than six consooutivo days&quot; is given.In some aroa8, e.g.   Yorkshire, Lancashlro and parts of Scotland, a week&apos;s holiday (without pay) is a well established custom.   On the. other hand, in many parts of the country, thoye is no annual holiday: and it should be noted that the agricultural labourers have not even got tho Saturday half-holiday $r its equivalent.   The woekly half-holiday should be mado obligatory inall /
jsJju.-wage framing employments.The- salaried staff in industry, including clerka, as a rule obtain an annual holiday with pay and this practice holds also to some extent, among shot assistants (oiher than those referred to abOvo)*A; number Of progressive firms&apos; new give the while tf their workpeople an annual holiday, usually of a week*s duration, with pay, and a short time1 age the Chemical Employers&apos; Federation, and the ttfade unions concerned arrived at an agrooment ,JJor tho introduction aftev the VJar. of an annual week&apos;8 holiday during which wages will be paid by the employers.There aro precedents, therefore, which go to prove the practicability of tho proposal *to establish iri Industry a regular holiday period eaoh year.I am fully oonvinoed thatij on a broad viewi, such a measure would not be a financial drain upon industry. The bonefioial effects on national health and vigour would more than counter-balance the cost Of tho wages paid for the holiday period. The following points would need to be borne in mind:-(a) It would be advisable Wat the law should apply directly to both male arid fomalo workers.(b) It should not bo allowable to broak up f.tho fortnight proposed into small fragmentary holidays, though tho actual dates when the holiday should take plaoe should bo arrangod by tho * Industries themselves^(e) It,would clearly bo neoossary to lay down aminimum period of employment with an employer&apos; which would entitle a workor to wages during the holiday.   It is suggested that this period should bo a year and that whore workpeople have been employed for six montha but less than twolve monthsprior to the beginhing of the annual holiday,, half wages should be paid.(d) Probably, provision would be required ;to &quot;safe-guard workpeoplo against unjustifiable dismissal prior to the holiday.(e) /
(e)   In the oo.se of piece workers, it would be. necessary to arrange for the payment of an agreed time wago for tho porlod of the holiday.The Scheme would ef acurso reqdre legislation and detailed provisions covering these and other points would bo included after more detailed investigations) The proposals of this Memorandum may be summarised as follows:-The weekly half holiday should be extended to allwage earners in regular employments.(2)An annual fortnights holiday, with full pay, should be established by law for all wago earners who havebeen in an employer^ service for twel&apos;70 months priorto the beginning of tho holiday. In the case of those engaged in an employer&apos;s servioe for six months but less than twelve months prior to the holiday, half wages should bo paid.(5) $ho date Of the holiday, which should cover fourteenconsecutive days, should be determined by therespondible^ organisations pf employers and workers orby the Industrial Council in each industry.0.
