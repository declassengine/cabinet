Political Intelligence Department,I Foreign Office.Rumania/003.JiEMORANDUMSept. 25, 1918.on:-,^Conversations iim two transilvanian leaders.On Saturday (September 21) two Transilvanian leaders, LlessES Octavian Goga and Bocu, arrived in this country, having escaped from Moldavia through Russia in disguise after five weeks1 exciting experiences.   Fir Goga is the well-known poet and dramatist. He has played the most prominent part in the Rumanian National Movement in Hungary during the past decade.     Just before the out-break of war he went to Rumania and co-operated with Mr Take Ionescu, Mr Filipescu and the other leading interventionists in demanding Rumania&apos;s entry into the war.   Apart from supporting this National Movement, he has not tied himself to any conventional political parties in Rumania,  and therefore may be regarded as an impartial critic of Rumanian politics, while at the same time he possesses unrivalled knowledge of the political situation of the Rumanians of Hungary.   The following notes of views expressed by Mr Goga and Mr Bocu in the course ofi these conversations seemed worthy of record.(1) The situation in Austria-Hungary.nIn the course of 1917 Mr Goga and his Transilvanian organisation at Kiyev established a clandestine communication with his co-racials in Hungary, and he has therefore been kept fairly well au courant of their situation.   He confirms the fact that there is intense war-weariness in the Austro-Hungarian Army.iHe spoke of the various mutinies which had occurred in different regiments, as to i/ihich information has already been received.   He also informed us that a large number of soldiers (how larg,e he could not say) belonged to a secret organisation called the Septembrists
whose watchword was &quot;No fighting after tho end of September&quot;. Brigandage was rife in all parts of Austria-Hungary.     In Trans11-vania numbers of deserters have taken to the mountains where they are living as outlaws, but the Government is unable to cope with them by moans of the ordinary gendarmerie.   They are said to possoes machlneguns, and their numbers, according Vo Mr Goga, in Transilvania amounted to 200,000.   (This seems a quite incredible figure, but Mr Goga insisted on it).   The Hungarian Government is redoubling its oppression of the Rumanians of Hungary.     In tho ssone established along the Rumanian frontier Rumanian schools are abolished;   elsewhere the primary schools have not yet been done away with, but the normal schools and theological seminaries are subjected to severo control and everything possible is being done to transform them into vehicles of Magyar propaganda.    At the diocesan synods of Arad and Karansebes commissaries of the Hungarian Government attended, but the Rumanian Church representatives totally refused to countenance their presence, which is a violation of their constitution, and refused to conduct business under, these conditions.Mr Goga was unable to give any information as to the where-abouts of the other Transilvanian leaders, with the exception of Maniu.     Reports had got about that he had got to Switzerland, but Mr Goga said definitely that he knew he was on the Italian front, where a considerable number of Transilvanian troops were employed.(2) Situation in Rumania.Mr Goga gave some amusing illustrations of the way in which the population of Iasi openly show their dislike of and disregard for the Germans,    Newspaper boys take every opportunity of shouting out &quot;Great Defeat of the Germans&quot;, &quot;Capture of Sofia&quot; and so on, and are encouraged by the population.
3.The people as a whole refuse to entertain the idea that the Treaty of Buoarest is in any way to he regarded as permanent and are determined to bring about, when the first opportunity offers, another intervention of Rumania in the war.   With a view to this, any military movements of &quot;the Allies in the Balkans and any growth of the revolutionary movement in Austria-Hungary is followed with the greatest interest.     In spite of the mistakes which General Averescu is considered to have committed when he entered on peace negotiations, he is none the loss looked on as a national hero. He is not considered a political leader of any importance, and his party, the so-called &quot;Liga Poporului&quot;, contains few politicians of any value.     But the bulk of the army, both officers and men, is prepared to accept his leadership in any attempt to oust the Germans, while the Russian Governments, both that of the Old Regime and the Bolsheviks, are considered to have betrayed Rumania and are therefore overwhelmed with obloquy, Fir Goga denied that there was any fundamental dislike of the Russian people amongst the Rumanian peasants.   The lawlessness and futility of Russian Bolshevik-policy has disgusted them) but Bolshevism of another sort is nevertheless in their minds.   They are determined when the first opportunity offers to secure,by peaceful means if possible, if not, by revolution, the completest measures of agrarian and electoral reform. They know they can expect.nothing from Marghilcman,   The political nucleus for such a movement is to &quot;be found amongst the political leaders in Bessarabia and Transilvania, between whom there is close contact, but it would be supported by the overwhelming majority of the population of Rumania.   Kr Goga believed that the reconstitution of Rumanian political life merely on the old party lines was g   absolutely out of the question.   Everything will depend on the peasants and on the wise leadership of them, in the conduct of what he hopes will be the peaceful revelation which must inevitably follow the expulsion of the Germans,   In the great
j!. e)united Rumania which Is his dream, Mr Goga is insistent that the*fullest democratic institutions^must prevail.   Asked as to-what would be the attitude of the Government of United Rumania towards other nationalities in Transilvania and elsewhere, he declared emphatically^ and said Ithat he meant to repeat this declaration publicly before long, that the very fullest cultural, religious and social autonomy would be guaranteed to other nationalities, (in the case of the Szekler counties also an administrative autonomy) and that he would strongly disapprove, and in this he , thought he had V e whole opinion of his nation behimd him, of the Rumanians attempting to impose on Magyars or Germans in Transilvania any disabilities such as have hitherto been inflicted by the Hungarian Government on Rumanians.Mr Goga saw a great deal of Professor Kasaryk when they were together in Russia.   He went across to Paris on Sunday (September 29). and there he will presumably play with Father Lucaci the leading role among the&apos;Transilvanians in constituting the now Rumanian National Council.      He understands the importance of elaborating, in conjunction with the other representatives of Austro-Hungarian nationalities, a practical political programme for the future.(3) Situation In Russia.Mr Goga and Mr Bocu in the course of their five weeks&apos; wanderings had many opportunities of observing the unpopularity of the Bolshevik Government among the peasant population in Russia. As to the Bolshevik leaders they gave some amusing instances of their fla-lvete.        In the case, for Instance, of one of the Bolshevik Commissaries, Mr Schwab, it was enough for them to declare that they were Bolshevik Rumanian -comrades for them at once to be invited into the ministerial train de luxe.    They are most insistent on the fact,-however, that while the Bolshevik regime is losing its hold on the sympathies of the population, the Revolution as a whole
5.I has most emphatically come to stay&apos;.   They declare that whatever happens the peasants are determined to keep the land.   An immense amount of harm continues to he done to the Allied cause in Russia by the German reports which are everywhere spread and widely believed by the peasants that the Allies intend to restore Tsarism.   Mr Goga several times urgently called our attention to the need in his opinion for categorical denials by the Allies of these rumours and for assurances by them that they have the greatest sympathy with the peasant point of view.
