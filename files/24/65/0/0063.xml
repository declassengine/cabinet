^ffiffifr Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;B Government]&apos;T $i3- rPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1918.89INDUSTRIAL DEMOBILISATION.I CIRCULATE a note which I have received from the Demobilisation and Reconstruction Committee of the Ministry of Munitions.A formal decision on the points raised in the fourth paragraph of the note is urgently required, and I must ask the War Cabinet to afford an early opportunity for its discussion.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.Ministry of Munitions of War, October 1, 1918.Note by the Demobilisation and Reconstruction Committee or theMinistry of Munitions.1. It seems highly desirable that a more precise definition should be obtained from the War Cabinet of the respective responsibilities of the Minister of Reconstruc-tion, the Ministfy of Labour, and the Minister of Munitions in regard particularly to the demobilisation of the civilian labour at present engaged on the manufacture of munitions. Until some clear understanding is arrived at on this point it is impossible for the officers of the Ministry of Munitions to work out in detail their plans for the termination of the large number of contracts for munitions of various kinds which will be outstanding at the end of the war.2. The Munitions Council Committee on Demobilisation and Reconstruction are basing their plans on the principle, to which they have obtained the assent of the Minister of Reconstruction, that the manufacture of munitions should not continue for a single day longer than is absolutely necessary and economically justifiable. To act otherwise would, in their opinion, be to delay the turn-over from war industry to peace industry, and would involve the waste on the production of useless munitions of materials that will be urgently required for all kinds of commercial and industrial work. In the case of some stores, such as motor vehicles, aero-engines, optical instruments^ and possibly guns, it will be more economical to complete the articles that have passed a certain stage in manufacture ; but if the principle indicated above is accepted, the manufacture of the great bulk of the ordinary munitions of war should be cut short at the earliest possible moment, and the articles in process of manufacture scrapped.3. While the Committee feel that action on these lines is economically sound, and will in the end lead to the most rapid transfer of labour and of manufacturing capacity to the normal products of peace, they are conscious that the termination of a large number of contracts at short notice may for a time aggravate the problem of unemployment during the immediate transitional period.It is for this reason that a clear understanding is desirable as to the precise responsibility of the Minister of Munitions in the matter of industrial demobilisation. It would appear that it is his duty ,to bring the manufacture of useless munitions to an end at the earliest possible moment, and that it rests entirely with the Minister of Labour, and with the Minister of Reconstruction, assisted, of course, to any extent possible, by all other Departments, to make the necessary arrangements for dealing with the labour thereby thrown out of employment. This is the sense in which the Minister of Munitions is at present proceeding.4. So long as the war continues, and possibly for some time after, the Minister of Munitions will be in control of most of the materials required by industry.  It is
clearly his duty to assist private firms, so far as possible, to make their preparations for the transfer from war industry to peace industry. It is also equally clearly his duty to supply all possible information to the Minister of Reconstruction and to the Minister of Labour with, regard to the volume and distribution of labour likely to be thrown out of employment, and the kinds of work to which this labour might be most usefully diverted. But the responsibility for the preparation of plans for the transfer of labour from one place to another, for the payment of any necessary unemployment allowances, for the registration of unemployed workpeople and of applications for labour on the part of employers, would seem to fall on the Minister of Reconstruction and the Minister of Labour.A precise definition of the responsibility of the Minister of Munitions in the matter would greatly assist the Committee in their work.5. It is frequently suggested that use should be made of the national factories to mitigate unemployment during the transition period. Those who offer this suggestion do not usually take into account the fact that to convert a large national factory to the manufacture of some industrial product would take from three to nine months. During this period a certain, number of skilled workmen would be employed, but there would be little or no employment for the large body of semi-skilled and unskilled workpeople attached to the factory. During the transition period several of the national factories will no doubt be used for stores or for the breaking down of filled ammunition, and employment will also be found for a considerable number of workpeople in clearing up the factories and preparing them for any post-war work that may be decided upon. But the fact needs to be faced that during the period immediately following the cessation of hostilities national factories cannot be depended upon to provide employment for more than a very small fraction of the number of-workpeople at present engaged in them.6. The question of the use to which national factories should eventually be put was discussed at the meeting of the Economic Defence and Development Committee of the War Cabinet, at which you were present, on the 24th September.Two courses appear to he open : (a.) To dispose of some factories that will clearly be redundant at the end of thewar, by lease or sale to private firms for post-war use. (6.) To arrive at some decision as soon as (possible as to the industrial products(apart from munitions), which the Government may desire to manufacturefor their own use, or for the use of Dominion Governments or localauthorities.On the first point a decision was obtained from the Economic Defence and Development Committee which, if ratified by the War Cabinet, will enable the Ministry of Munitions to enter into negotiations with private firms for the eventual lease or sale of some of the national factories.On the second point a declaration of policy on the part of the War Cabinet would be of the greatest assistance. If the Government would determine what articles the State, as such, would consider itself justified in manufacturing in national factories, or would even lay down the general principle that it is open to the State to manufacture any articles used in bulk by the Imperial Government, or required by Dominion Governments or local authorities, it would be a comparatively simple matter for the Ministry of Munitions to make recommendations for the post-war use of :some of the national factories at present under its control.
