CONTROL OP MEDICAL BOARDS DEALING VflTHAWARD OP PENSIONS,Memorandum by the Minister of National Service.The dominant fact to be kept in mind in considering the proposal of the Ministry of Pensions is the acute shortage of medical practitioners- a shortage so serious that the Ministry of National Service, which is entrusted with the distribution of medical man power, has for some time found it impossible to meet even the minimum of the competing claims for doctors.   The most important of these claims are of course the needs of the Armed Forces of the Crown and those of the civil population.To secure the rigid economy enforced by this situation in the fullest measure compatible with the efficiency of the Public Service the Ministry of National Service has endeavoured to act on two broad principles.     The first, of these is the employment as members of its boards throughout the country of local practi-tioners on a part time basis for such days and hours only as are f*mnd necessary, leaving them in the intervals to carry out their ordinary and necessary professional duties to the civil population.The second principle, on which the efficiency of the National Service medical system mainly depends, is that in the interests alike of the State and. of the individual the determination of a man&apos;s physical fitness for admission into the Armed Forces and of the degree of physical disability on his discharge should &apos; . be made by Boards drawn from the same panel and acting under the same guidance and administration.It has not been found possible to apply these two principles completely, and in practice the Ministry of National Service has been obliged to acquiesce in a certain degree of dual control in the determination of the disability of men discharged, or about to be discharged, from the Armed Forces.     Thus the primary examina-tion of men discharged disabled from Naval or Military Hospitals is carried out by a Naval, Air Force, or Military Medical Board, and, where the disability is neurasthenia, by the Special Medical Board of the Ministry of Pensions, whilst men discharged disabled from Discharge Centres or passed to the Reserve are examined by the National Service Medical Boards,     It is not at present pro-posed, so far as I am aware, to interfere with this arrangement. On the other hand the Ministry of National Service, at the request of the Ministry cf Pensions, carries out, with certain somewhat illogical exceptions, the medical examinations in connection with the review of pensions which is periodically required.While It is not my intention at present to press for a more complete application of these principles which would undoubtedly recult in useful economies in men and money, I cannot assent to the proposals of the Ministry of Pensions which would equally certainly lead to extravagance in both.     The suggestion that the sphere of the, Special Medical Board should be extended to cover assessments of disability throughout the Country in all cases of neurasthenia and nerve disorder is one which with the
i ui.i i,i i, iii jny s 188existing -supply of doctors cannot be carried out,     The principle, moreover, of dealing with cases of special d:,i utility by Boards consisting exclusively of specialists in the di.*ability in question, appears to me to be medically unsound - quite apart from the financial and other difficulties which it involves.     The proposal to&apos; extend the sphere of the present Chelsea Board to the whole of London is less objectionable only because it would not involve so serious a draft 4n our diminishing reserve of doctors,&apos;    Whatever justifica-tion there may be for the maintenance of the present Chelsea Board en the ground of its &quot;instructional&quot; character it appears to me .. that there oan be none for increasing the number of medical men which it employs and aggravating the present duplication and over* lapping of medical activities between the two Ministries.With regard to the provision of medical assistance to the officers awarding pensions at Chelsea, I would point out that this system is wrong in principle inasmuch as these 6ffleers revise and alter assessments made by Medical Boards without seeing the Pen-sioner concerned, and further that their number must necessarily be ^limited by the existing supply of suitable modical men.    As the Boards acting under the administration of the Ministry of National Service acquire experience and skill in the assessment of disability the need for such medical assistance should diminish, and in any case the Ministry of National Service may claim to have supplied, and to be supplying, as many medical officers for this purpose as is possible, consistently with other claims of at least equal importance.In general it may be said that the system of medical Boards established by the Ministry of National Service on the principles above set forth has worked on the whole most satisfactorily-through-out the Country.    It has acquired the confidence of the public and has enlisted in the public service a body of practitioners whose skill and standing enable them, with special assistance when required, to deal competently with the problems presented by the assessment of disability.    To disturb or duplicate this system would not only involve a grave waste of national resources, but would critically embarrass the already difficult medical situation throughout the country.My chief objection however to the suggestien that the Ministry of Pensions should develop a system of medical boards is rooted in a general principle which I regard as of great importance.     I am absolutely convinced that at an early date a Ministry of Health must be established in this country and that that Ministry must have as its primary function the control of the civil medical,pro-fession so far as that profession is to be controlled in the interests of the State.    At present the Ministry of National Service is con-trolling in some measure practically every civil medical practitioner under 56 years of age in Great Britain.    Further, it is a purely temporary department, and as such is ready to hand over to a Ministry of Health its medical functions as soon as that Department is ready to receive them.     In fact, if a Ministry of Health is to be estab-lished during the War, it must, if it is to have the broad basis which I believe essential to its success, begin its organisation by taking oyer the Medical Department of the Ministry of National Service.     If the Ministry of Pensions, or any other Department of State, now begins to develop a medical service, there will only be added further confusion to the present unhappy muddle which marks the State1 s control of health and health problems with further waste of public funds, and further establishment of vested interests.The remaining questions touched upon in the Memorandum of the
28.9.18.A. C. GSDDBS.Ministry of Pensions are financial in character and more directly concern the Treasury than the Ministry of National Service.     I must, however, strongly deprecate the establishment of higher rates for medical officers of the Ministry of Pensions than those enjoyed by the medical men employed by the Ministry of National Service, which, 1 believe, are fairly adjusted to the services rendered and are loyally accepted by all concerned.    I may add that the fees paid.to medical practitioners employed by the Ministry of National Sen&apos;ice have been arranged after due consultation and agreement with the representative Professional Committees throughout the country,I attach (Appendix I) notes dealing in detail with the points raised In Sir John Collie&apos;s Memorandum and (Appendix II) comparative statements of cost of Medical Personnel of Boards for neurasthenic cases of Ministry of National Service (Pensions) and Ministry of Pensions, both of which have been prepared by Sir James Galloway, the Chief Commissioner of Medical Services.at the Ministry of National Service.
soHflTES ON MEMORANDUM BY SIR JOHN COLLIE M.D., C.M.Q., D.M.S, MINISTRYtf^feNSIONS. DATED 26th ka^rsQS16,lKtil!m^^WTtTl^^fW-,pjggNS ON loth&apos;SI-PTErBi?R; 1918,&quot;&quot; &apos; &quot; - JWfOAl EXAMINATION ON INVALIDING FROM H.M.FORCES.This work has, as Sir- John Qollie says, until recently been carried out by the Navy and Army with the exception of cases of Neurasthenia and functional nervous disordersi   By special arrange- . mepetween the Army Authorities and the Ministry of Pensions, men discharged on account of Neurasthenia etc*d hive been referred by the Military Authorities to Special Medical Boards, under the Ministry .$f Pensions for examination and assessment of disability,The Memorandum, however, is incorrect in stating that the Neurasthenic eases ftrm the only exception.   Shortly after the Ministry of National Service became responsible for the raising of men for His Majestyfs Forces and the establishment of National Service Medical Boards for the examination of Recruits, the desirability of establishing civilian Medical Boards at Discharge Centres became manifest, and from April 1916 to August 1918, National Service Medical Boards and Military Medical Boards sat side by side at Discharge Centres, the latter to decide whether the soldier was or was not physically unfit for further War Service, and the former to decide whether the soldier, whom it had been decided to release, though not physically unfit for further War Service, had or had not been impaired in health since his entry into the service, and to place him in the grade for which they considered .him fit.   This system resulted In a duplication of work and waste of Medical Personnel and was replaced in August by the establishment of Civilian Medical Boards under the Ministry of National Service with a Military Member attached to each Beard at all Discharge Centres. These National Service Medical Boards have now been in operation for some weeks and decide (a) the question of whether or not a soldier is physically unfit for further War Service;(b) his Medical Grade; lc) the causation of his impairment, If any, during his Military Service; (d) the assessment 6f his disability If any,&apos; and (e) they recommend treatment (where ^quired) tc be carried out by the Ministry of Pensions.Similar arrangements have been made with the Royal Air Force. These National Service Boards at Discharge Centres assess disabilities cf all kinds, including cases of Neurasthenia etc. and for the latter purpose a Neurologist is attached to each Discharge Centre.Underlying- these arrangements is the sound principle that, in the Interests both of the State and the Individual soldier the determina* tion of questions of Impairment and degree of disability due to 7/ar Service should be made on a man&apos;s release from service by Medical Boards, the members of which are drawn from the same panels and act under the same guidance and administration and according to the same standards as the Eoards which admitted him into the Service.   Between the 15th of April and the 51st August 30,067 men were examined by these National Service Boards at Discharge Centres.   It is desirable from every point of view t at this principle should apply to all discharges from Kis Majesty^ Forces.APPENDIX I.
MEDICAL EXAMINATION ON RE-SURVEY OF A. CONDITIONAL PENSION A?/ARD...-1.At the request of the Ministry of Pensions and in accordance with successive agreements between the Ministry of National Service and the Ministry of Pensions the re *-exam:* nation of all pensioners (other than those suffering from Neurasthenia) formerly carried out by the Naval and Military Authorities has been made by the National Service Medical Boards through-out Great Britain, except in the case of Pensioners - residing in the following postal areas:-   N., N.W., W., S.W., W.C. and E.C. of the London Postal District.   This exception was made in response to the wish of the Minister of Pensions, who was anxious to preserve the Boards at Chelsea which deal with cases resident in the London District, as an instructional centre under his direct supervision.   The separation of this &amp;e-survey Board from the organised system of re-survey Boards over the whole country, however, is regrettable from every point of view;   it is confusing so far as administration Is concerned and is wasteful of Medical Personnel.   Even if its value as an instructional centre were admitted, it Is to be expected that its sphere   of usefulness In this respect will gradually disappear as the re-survey Boards generally acquire experience in the work.   But, outside very narrow limits (including acquaintance with official forms and procedure), Re-survey Boards are not, and cannot be, apt torinstructional&quot; (In the sense of &quot;teaching&quot;) purposes, although experience of Board work Is very valuable.   In the view ot this Ministry the accurate assessment of disabilities and the determination of question of attributability, demand from Medical Boards - Firstly and above all, thorough clinical knowledge and experience;   Secondly the provision of recognised expert Specialist opinion wherever required and Thirdly, as the essential standard for comparison and as the basis of assessment, a sound knowledge of the physical capacity of the ordinarily healthy man, according to his age.   Doubtless the Chairman of the Board requires both thorough acquaintance with official forms and procedure and administrative ability, and the Ministry of National Service is fortunate in having a body of Deputy Commissioners of Medical Services, carefully selected, -who have for the most part served in Kls Majesty&apos;s Services, of proved administrative ability, who as a result of their combined services, have little to learn in the matter of official procedure.   Instruction in recent develop-ments in some fields of medicine is to be sought elsewhere than in Medical Boards and is being afforded the D.Cs.M.5. of this Ministry by permission of the Military Authorities in Maghull, Colchester and at Orthopaedic centres.
YliUnregard to Neurasthenic etc. cases, those were by agreement with the Ministry of &quot;Pensions to be dealt with by National Service Medical Boards (Pensions) except in the case of London, and also of tho districts.served by the Special Medical Boards In Dublin, Belfast, Liverpool and Edinburgh;until these Boards wore transferred to&apos; the Ministry of National Service. Cases of Neurasthenia have thus come before National Service-JsiediaaL &quot;Boards for re-survey outside these districts, and it was with a view to enlarging the clinical outlook of D.CS.M.S. and-thus enabling&apos;them to approach the problems of - their work with&apos;a fuller knowledge of recent developments in special departments of-medicine and surgery, that the Instructional Courses referred to by Sir John Collie were instituted and not, as is inferred by him, with the intention of transforming Deputy Commissioners of Medical Services in the course of a few weeks, or even in a few.months, into Specialist Neurologists - an objoct which is as unattainable as it is undesirable for the purpose in view.     So far from being useless, the facilities for instruction and classes specially arranged for D.CS.M.S. by kind permission of the Military Author-ities at Maghull, Colchester and elsewhere have proved most valu-able, and the Ministry of National Service is grateful to the Military Authorities for affording this opportunity for special study.    With regard to War Neurqs.es the assessment .of disability incases of Neurasthenia &amp;c. and recommendations for treatment in these cases   the Ministry of National Service has always recognised the importance of this work;&apos;   its difficult nature and the &quot;serious possibilities of injuring both the individual and the State, by faulty diagnosis and prognosis, or narrow views;   and the value of oxperience and training in such work.     The considered view of this Ministry in such cases,, as in special cases in other departments of Medicine, is that, the safest course in the interests of the State, the best In the interest of the man, and the only -practicable policy in the present, depleted state   of the Medical profession, is to secure&apos; the services as one member of tho Board whenever Neurasthenic cases come before it, of a Neurological expert, of acknowledged standing and proved capacity in his specialty..-&apos;   In this way, It is contended a better-balanced, view of such cases is obtained, and the neediosa cost of obtaining separate opinions from two Boards, when (as so often happens) bodily injuries and Neurasthenic conditions arc combined in the same individual is avoided.    This Department agrees with Sir John Collie upon the necessity for employing; adequately trained Medical men for Special Cases, but holds further that by tho term &quot;adequately trained men&quot; should bo meant, not general practitioners who have a few months training in the assessment of Neurasthenic disabilities but recognised experts of lifelong training in their, specialty.Notwithstanding this, if and when in accordance with agroe-ments arrived at in conference between the Ministry of Pensions and the Ministry of National Service the Special Boards outside those in London are transferred to the ministry of National Service, this i inistry will bo prepared to employ such of the Medical Fersonnoi as comply with the requirements of this Min-.-istry in the foregoing sense of the words &quot;adequately trained&quot;.
Payment of Members of National Service Medical Boards.Sir John Collie&apos;s comparative statement of tho payments-to members of Medical Boards under the Ministry of Fens ions and under-the Ministry of National Service is founded on erroneous ideas of the constitution of the Boards of tho latter Authority.National Service Medical Boards are of four kinds, viz:-National Service Boards for Recruiting purposes;   National Service Medical Boards at Discharge Centres; National Service Medical Boards (Pensions)i and National Service Medical Boards (Pensions Consultant) . !   Tho last named Boards, for whoso establishment provision has been made but which are only to bo called together &apos; to examine cases of exceptional difficulty, have not so far been required.     The payment for the members of these Consultant Boards, whose panels are selected only from men of the highest professional standing, will bo made at the rate of three guineas a session.     It is not expected that these Boards will bo required so often as to raise the total cost of expend!turo by any considerable amount.     Ordinary members of all the remaining National Service Medical Boards are paid at the rate of one guinea a session,.    Boards whoso members are recompensed on the above scale have dealt with the groat mass of men on entry into and discharge from H.?-. Forces since the National Service Boards came into operation.     Provision, however, is made for the best expert opinion on special cases.     These specialists, medical men recognised and. acknowledged to bo masters of their specialty by many years of special education, experience and practice,  are recompensed at the rate of two guineas per session.     Such a specialist Is not necessarily, however,  as Sir John Collie supposes, additional to the members of a National Service Medical Board, but may bo, and as a rule Is, included in the Board, i*e, he replaces one of the ordinary members,,  tho Board remaining of normal composition as regerds number.The number of Nodical men composing each National Service Medical Board should here bo mentioned.Each N.D.M. Board for Recruiting purposes is composed nor-mally of four members, presided over by one Chairman or D.G.1-.S.Each N.S.M. Board at a Discharge Centre consists of two H.S. Members with one Military Member attached, generally arrang-ed in groups with a D.C.M.S. in charge of the group.Each N.S.M. Board (Pensions) consists of two members and a C ha i man,, the latter being generally a D.C .*!.&amp;.., a whole time official of the finistry.At times and places where it is necessary to have Boards grouped at a Centre to dealwith large numbers of pensioners coming up for review tho Chairmanship of each Board is entrusted to a selected Vice Chairman not necessarily a whole-time official
of tho Ministry, and tho group of Boards works under the general administration of tho D.C.M.S. who is thus avail-able for reference in any particular- case.   . In tho case of such groups also the specialist may be attached to tho group as a whole thus affecting considerable economy.Tho above statement refers to N.S.M.Boards (Pensions) dealing with cases of all kinds, neurasthenic or other. With regard to Neurasthenia, however, the Ministry insists that whenever a pensioner suffering, from neurasthenia, shell-shock &amp;c., comes up for a review of pension, a medical man having special knowledge of and experience in functional nervous and mental diseases shall be included in tho Board, yhe extensive panels of the N.S.M. Boards offor so wide selec-tion to the D.C.H.S. that they are enabled to obtain the services of such specially qualified medical men at tho ordin-ary ratos as members of tho Board.   In cases of special doubt or difficulty with which the Board so constituted is not com-petent to dealj one or other of two courses may be followed: Either an expert of consultant rank may bo asked to become a member of the Board at the approved rate of two guineas a session;   or the case may be referred by the Commissioner of Medical Services to a Pensions Consultant Board.     As already stated no occasion for the last named course has yet arisen. The system thus outlined is seen to be at once elastic and economical;   for whilst ensuring the highest medical opinion in&apos;cases whose difficulty justifies the greater expenditure; it does not involve payment at the higher rate in cases which do not warrant such an exceptional 3tep.     Tho comparative tab*C ular statement attached to these notes makes the financial economy effected by these means abundantly clear.Medical Assistance to Awarding Officers of the Ministry of PensionsThe Awarding Officers of tho Ministry of. Pensions aro.assisted by some twenty medical officers whoso duties consist largely of the scrutiny of the documents of pensioners returned to the Ministry of Pensions aftor completion by the medical Boards. Doubtless such an -establishment has boon necessary in the past in order to correct the mistakes, and discrepancies of assess-mont for like disabilities made by medical Boards.     It appears *,b* tious   however that the necessity for such medical assistance must&quot; diminish and it is hoped in time disappear entirely as and when tho Boards attain to uniformity of procedure and assess-ment.     The essential flaw of this system consists in the fact that the assessments made by properly constituted Boards are revised and altered by medical assessors who never see the men whose disabilities they review.     The Ministry cannot but re-gard this procedure with concern as being wrong in principle, as leaving entirely out of count the individual value of the pensioner as compared with the average healthy man of his age;as consideringhim instead/
instead as a mere statement on paper of certain disabilities, many of which are impossible of proper assessment without personal examination;   and as likely to lead to the very fault this system was set up to correct - unequal or unjust assessment.     The proper course, when apparent mistakes or discrepancies come to the notice of the Ministry of Pensions, would be to remit, the documents to the Medical Board for their information and observations.     Standard-isatlon and uniformity of assessment can only be obtained by Boards acting under one central authority, which works upon a sound system and supervises the work and procedure in its entirety.   The Ministry of National Service wish it understood that the above criticism is called for entirely by the revision of assessments of medical and surgical disabilities and has no reference to revision on other grounds, actuarial or other, which are purely matters for the Ministry of Pensions.Payment for time spent in travelling.The Ministry of National Service has no scale of payment for time spent in travelling.     when its medical officers travel on duty they receive their appropriate subsistence allowance and payment in respect of the sessions on which they sit.     This is an admitted hardship when in response to a sudden National emergency medical officers have to travel considerable distances and lose any recompense for loss of time.     On one or two occasions in very special emergencies members of N.S. Travelling Boards have received payment at whole-time rates; but this is a different matter from the concession of a general scale of payment for loss of time.     There is, however, no objection to this principle if the Treasury approve.Salaries and Fees.The payment by the Ministry of Pensions to members of its Boards at the rate of one guinea and a half a session has already placed the Ministry of National Service at a disadvantage;and has even given risa to acrimonious correspondence through a confusion of the Medical Boards of the two authorities, on the part of the correspondents *     It is greatly to be desired that this difference in payment may be reviewed as early as possible.     The reference in the Memorandum to allowances paid to presidents of N.S.M. Boards in additon to their salary of  750 is not understood.     The DfC*StM.S. of this Ministry are paid salaries ranging from  650 to  800 a year, and receive no allowances except subsistence allowance when travelling *Medical Consultants to Appeal Courts.Provision has already been made by the Ministry of National Service for the medical examinations of pensioners who appeal against their assessment.     Such men have been examined irrespective of the date of expiry of their pensions (he- in most cases very shortly after their , original examination and award) at the request of the Ministry of Pensions, for some time and in considerable numbersAs the Ministry of National Service, furthert in addition to ordinary Pensions Boards has established Pensions Board with specialists and Pensions Consultant Boards, it would appear unnecessary to create further Boards to dis-charge the same function.(
