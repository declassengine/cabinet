MEMORANDUM FOR WAR CABINET.With reference to War Cabinet 464 Minute 9 dated 27th August, 1918, arrangements are being made to provide a certain measure of leave to the United Kingdom for the troops serving in Mesopotamia. This leave is considered, to be of great importance but in order to provide it concurrently with the move of 12 Battalions from Mouopo-tamia to Salonika (part of the transference of units consequent on the raising of fresh Battalions in India) it is necessary to entrench on the shipping held in the Med.iterrar.ean for strategic purposes to a small extent for a very limited period.  , As these moves from Basra will be worked in two convoys with an interval between them of two weeks, the actual periods during which the reserve of shipping held in the Mediterranean will be insufficient to carry a complete Division will only amount in all to a week or ten days.In view of all the circumstances including the military sitra-tion, it is considered by the Army Council that this slight departurecould be made from the actual letter of the War Cabinet decision referred to above..2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.  7th September, 1918.
