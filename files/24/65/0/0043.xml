3BCRET.       / A- WAR CABINET. &apos;       142G.T.5843.DOCKYARD APPRENTICES AWD MILITARY SERVICE.Memorandum by the Admiralty recording the position of Apprentices Released from H.M.Dockyards and Naval Establishments for Military Service during the War.All Apprentices in H.M.Dockyards and Nsval Establishments serve under an indenture,   The period of Apprenticeship has recently been reduced from 6 years to 5 years; six months being remitted in the case of existing six year Apprenticeship.An assurance was given by the Admiralty early in the war that Apprentices joining the Military forces would hove the time they served in such forces counted ay part of their apprenticeship, and this assurance is being carried into effect,The question has recently arisen as to the manner in which Apprentices returning from Military service are to be dealt with In cases in which the full period of their apprenticeship has expired, and in which the Dockyard Officers find themselves unable to certify that--the men in question are competent workmen in their trades*It was held that, apart from the question of the moral title of the Apprentices not to &quot;be penalised in their civil status in consequence of having, (been called upon to render Military service, in place of civilian ser-vice under conditions more desirable in every way, the Admiralty are bound to keep faith with the Apprentices and to do all that can possible be done to place them in the position they would have secured if they had continued their employ-ment in the Dockyards and Naval EstablishBunts.It has accordingly been decided that, in any oase in which a man tfho   has been serving in the Military Forces is in consequence found not to be fully qualified in his trade at the termination of the period of Apprenticeship, he is to be given the rating and wages Y/hich he would have had had he not so spent a portion of his Apprenticeship time in the Military Forces.   Par this purpose the certificate of competency has been waived;   but this fact will be noted against the man&apos;s rating on the Dockyards books, and at the termination cf&apos;a further period of service In his trade the case will be reviewed so that when the circumstances warrant the man may, with the certificate of the Officers, be borne-as a fully qualified Mechanic,   If the man does not in due course of time render himself efficient, and have his Indenture endor-sed to that effect, he will endanger his chances of continued employment.-Practically, therefore, the period served in the Porcescounts as Apprenticeship time;except that each case is ear-marked so that the men returning from the forces shall feel themselves under an obligation to make their best endeavours to qualify themselves for their ratings.- In no case Is an Apprentice transferred to the grade of Journeyman until he resumes his civil employmentThe total number of Apprentices affected by the scheme is not large.   Probably it will not ^ceed 500,:,h September 1918, (Intd,) r.s.h.    1
