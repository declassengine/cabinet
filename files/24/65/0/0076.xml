218(THIS DOCUaCSKT IS THE PROPERTY      HIS ^^BRITAg^I^ MA JESTY] S GOVERKMBMT .)1.   In accordance with paragraph 11 (c) of the War Cabinet&apos;s proceedings of the 17th September (473), I beg to submit for their consideration the following memorandum.2.   At the commencement of the present war the regulations were those in force during the South African War,   As regards soldiers&apos; widows no provision had been made by the State before that war.3c   The rates for officers&apos; w&amp;Jows were fairly liberal, but the conditions were somewhat strict ana suitable only for a small regular Army,     Thus, the highest rate with a gratuity-was given only for death in action or from wounds received in action;    the intermediate rate only if death was from illness directly traceable to fatigue, privation, or exposure incident to active operations in the field or from injuries received in the performance of military duty;    and the ordinary rate only if the officer had completed 10 years service or     years if death was the direct result of the discharge of his duties.4C   The rates introduced in the South African War for soldiers&apos; widows cannot be termed liberal-,     Even the widow of a Class 1 N,CkOu (quartermaster sergeant) received only 10/- a week for herself and 2/- a week for each child, while the Private&apos;s widow had only 5/- for herself and l/6 for each child. But the condition qualifying for the pension, at least in disease cases, was fairly wide, it being necessary only that the disease should have commenced or been contracted during active service, irrespective of the cause of it (other than fault or negligence).5*   The tendency therefore for the present war has been(a) in the case of Officers&apos; widows to relax the conditions, and(b) in the case of soldiers&apos; widows to increase the rates.60   At an early stage of the present war it became necessary to recruit large numbers, of men of all classes, including- a largo-proportion of married men and of men receiving high wages in  : civil life.   The war too was of an unprecedented character,-   It was evident that the low rates of pension for soJ.di.ers1 families must be materially increased, and a Select Committee was appointed to review.the question of war pensions generally.     Their proposals as to pensions of soldiers and their families were embodied in Royal Warrants dated the 21st May, 1915&quot;.     The pensions of widows and orphans were considerably increased, the Private-s widow receiving 10/- Or 15/- a week, according to age. and the children^ 5A for the first, 3/6 for the second, and 2/- for each other child.     A small gratuity of  3 was allowed to the widow.
219** 2 *p7.     The Delect Committee then, dealt with officers, and after duly considering proposals put before thorn by the War Office dnoldod that&apos;the only increase.in rates which was neoossary/to raise tho subalterns11 widows1 pensions to the level of the Captain1 s, i.o. from  80 to  100 in the highest scale and from  60 to  75 in tho intermediate scale. But they made certain extensions in tho conditions for the several grades of pension.   Thus, (a) violent death due directly and wholly to war service qualified for the highest rate with gratuity, (b) death from disease directly attributable to military service (whether in the field or not) qualified for the intermediate rate, and (c) a gratuity up to tho 3 years1 pay was introduced for other eases where the officers service was insufficient to entitle his widow to tho ordinary rate of pension.     JPurther, education allowances for children in cases of pecuniary need, up to  35 for a boy and to  25 for a girl were introduced.     These changes were published in the Royal Warrant of the 25th November, 1(315&apos;*By 02i oarlier Warrant (12th July, 1915) the War Office had given to temporary rank the same value as substantive rank in case? of officers dying&quot; from wounds or injuries.80     In July, 1916. a Warrant was approved allowing a gratuity &apos; to widows of soldiers dying of disease aggravated &quot;by military service.     These gratuities were not in fact issued, but a temporary allowance was paid as from the 1st March, 1916.9,     On the formation of the Ministry of Tensions the revision of tho soldiers1 pension regulations was at once taken up, ,and a Royal Warrant was signed on tho 29th March, 1917, which again increased the rates of pension of soldiers1 widows.   The rate for a Private,*s widow was increased to 13/9d, a weqk (15/- if over 45), and the children^ rates wore altered to 5/- for the first child, 4/2 for the second, 3/4 for tho third, and 2/6 for each additional child. Pensions for death from disease aggravated by military services wore allowed, and alternative pensions based on the husband1s pro-war earnings introduced,10.   The revision of officers1 pensions was then taken in hand by the Minister of Pensions assisted by his Statutory Advisors ( the Financial secretaries of the War Office and Admiralty and tho larliamontary- Secretary of the Local Government Board. ).    They; also decided that there was no sufficient ground for any general increase of the scale of pensions for officers1 widows, hut they decided to raise tho rates of childrenrs allowances in ranks below Lieut-Colonel to tho level for Lieut-Colonel1s children, and their
2- 3 -proposals, embodied in the Royal Warrant of the 1st August,1917, conferred considerable advantages &quot;by once more relaxingthe conditions for the two higher grades of pension and Toysupplementary provisions.   Injuries received in theperformance of military duty and illness directly traceableto exposure, etc., incident to active operations no1,? qualifyfor the highest rate (without gratuity), while for theintermediate rate it is merely necessary that the injesty ordisease should have, been attributable to or aggravated bymilitary service.   Alternative pensions were introduced;temporary and acting rank counts in disease as well as woundcases; the limit for girls&apos; education allowances is raised to .c 3 r11.      The latest warrant dealing with soldiers&apos; widows is that of April 17th, 1918, which left the scale for widows unchanged but increased the children&apos;s scale to 6/8 for the first child, &apos;5/- for the second, and 4/2 for each additional child.   The widow&apos;s gratuity was raised to  5 and. a gratuity of  1 allowed for each child. &apos;   The alternative pension is to be two-thirds, instead of one-half, of the alternative pension which would have been granted to the husband if totally di s able d.A proposal, arising cut of the &quot;Warrant of the 17th April, 1913, that an officer&apos;s widow&apos;s alternative pension should be two-thirds instead of one-half of the husband&apos;s masimum alternative, pension has been submitted to the Treasury but up to the present they have not given their assent to it.12.      To sum up, for the present war beneficial changes have been introduced for the families of both officers and men, and these changes have taken the form best suited to the circumstances and. with regard to the previously existing provisions.   If the mcnVs widows have relatively gained more, it is because their previous pensions were more decidedly inadequate.The altered conditions of warfare in the present war, as compared with former wars, have introduced factors which did not previously exist, and have thus affected the conditions on which pensions should be given to officers&apos; widows,   ]?or example, new modes of warfare and new risks from explosives led to the admission to the highest rate with gratuities (formerly limited to deaths in actitin) of   cases of &quot;violent death due directly and wholly to war service&quot;, Again,  as to disease, it was no longer found possible to limit recognition to deaths due to operations in the field to the exclusion of those due to or aggravated oy strain or exposure in other spheres.. .The chances and uncertain!ties of promotion in a vast army rendered a distinction between acting and substantive rank no longer tenable,     But (a) the fact that the conditions of the present war have involved such modifications is no reason for their extension to previous wars when circumstances were different and (b) it would be quite impracticable in most cases to review tho facts of past cases in the light of altered regulations.There
221- 4 -; There was- no strong reason for a general revision of the rates of pensions and allowances of officers&apos; widows. In the first place, the rates for soldiers and their families had to he increased chiefly &quot;because it ran necessary to recruit the new armies to a large extent from &quot;better paid strata of the population than those which hae filled the ranks of the old army.   There was no such change in regard to officers; in fact, as time has gone on,  she comadssionsd ranks are being filled more and more by the jess well-to-do classes-.   In the second place, the pensions of officers and their families had previously been on a far more liberal scale than those cf men, and both the Select Committee in 191b and the Minister of pensions in 1917 decided that the existing rates were generally sufficient.   On the other hand, the pensions and allowances given to soldiers&apos; widows and children in the South African War v-ere not an adequate -provision, ana for the present war, demanding service from a large proportion Cf married men with good earnings in civil life;  increased rates beoame essential.   Mr. Barnes took as a general standard in comparing the lowest rank of Officer with the private the proportion of 2 to 1,- and even with the increases recently allowed to soldiers&apos; families, that pro-portion&apos; is roughly maintained in respect to widows.   It should also not be for rotten that widows of officers killed in action were granted in the South African War. and are still granted substantial gratuities; e*g. a Second Lieutenant&apos;s widow.: with three children gets a gratuity of  200; whereas even in the present war the soldier&apos;s widow with three children gets a gratuity of       only,13.   Of the two decision of the War Cabinet the first, viz: t -. raiso tho widows of subalterns killed in action in former wars from  80. to  100 will present no difficulty,,   it should, however, be observed, that the widows of subalterns who died of disease or injury on duty will still remain on tho old intermediate rate of  60j  and as these were considerable in number in cam-paigns ouch as the Sudan and South Africa,  the question Of their position is likely to be raised as soon as the improvement in the killed in&apos;action cases is carried out0-Posoibly, therefore; those should be increased from  60 to  75 (Captain&apos;s int ermeaiato rate).14.   The second decision of the War Cabinet, as to increasing the rstos of Generals&apos; wicows, will not affect many cases.   The only rate which was &quot;special&quot; and not prescribed was the *hi dieat * rate,  and this was in practice fixed at  500 a year, inclusive of children, for all grades /
of General.   The change made in the Royal Warrant of the 1st August, .1917, was to grade the various typed of General Officers and assign to each exact rates of pension, highest and intermediate, exclusive of children?s allowances.   It would be possible to review the cases -of widows of General Officers dying In former wars and see if any of them would benefit by this hew scale, but,,except in the intermediate cases, few would probably do soi     (see Statement attached).15*      It;is presumed that any &quot;changes beneficial to Army widows must be applied also,to Navy widows.10*      It,should not be overlooked that a concession, to the widows may lead to appeals from o fleers disabled In former wars for increased rates of retired pay*-     The concessions recently made to men are, briefly, (a) that men with specific injuries due to former war service may have the pensions provided by the schedule to the present war warrant, and (b) that men totally disabled by the direct and traceable effects of disease due to former war service may have the present rates for total disablement..   If the new concessions to men were followed, the majority of disabled officers would probably not gain, since those with serious wounds would have permanent wound pensions, the rate of which has not been increased in the present war except that the subalterns have been raised to-Captain1a rate;   but there might be a few totally disabled by their disabilities and without wound pensions who under the old Pay Warrant received retired pay. equal to half pay ( 54.15,0 a year fur an Infantry Subaltern) and under the -present war warrant would have received.more ( 175 a year for a Captain or Subaltern).     Without making any recommendation as to .the revision of these old awards.,. I think it right to mention the possibility of an increase being claimed.(Sgd.)    JOH.
