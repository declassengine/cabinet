A letter from the Ministry of Shipping was considered and it was agreed that Captain F. B. Elliot should be nominated as the representative of the Ministry of Food on the Tonnage Priority Committee.The proposal of the Wheat Commission that G.R. flour should consist of: 10 per cent, imported flour,75 per cent, wheaten flour, milled to an extraction of 85 per cent, .&quot; . 15 per cent, diluent cereals, w ,was approved in principle but any steps for adopting it were deferred until the Shipping Programme was settled., It was decided that in the meantime Sir Alan Anderson and Mr. Peat should look into the financial aspect of the change.  .A memorandum to the War Cabinet on Food Imports was considered and approved.It was agreed that the Council should meet twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10.30 a.m.
Committee of Representatives. - A meeting of this Committee was held on Wednesday, 25th September. Meetings of the Freight Committee have also been held during this week. Several conferences with the shipping authorities have taken place, and considerable progress has been made with the settlement of the reduced programme of food imports for the period up to the end of December.Central Agricultural Advisory Council. A meeting of the Council was held on Tuesday, September 24, Sir Charles Bathurst in the chair. In connexion with the proposed scheme of milk control, the Council approved a draft Milk (Sales Restriction) Order empowering the Food Controller to issue directions relating to the allocation and distribution of milk. A memorandum on the general scheme was also read and approved. It was decided to form a sub-committee to confer with officials of&quot; the Ministry on the subject of a suggested Order for the distribution of feeding-stuffs.Mr. Clynes was present at the meeting, and gave a short address to the members of the Council, who received him very warmly. He stated fully bis desire to meet the interests of producers, but reminded them that he also had to take into his consideration the demands of the millions of consumers.Consumers1 Cowieil. A meeting of this Council was held on Wednesday, September 25, Mr. Clynes in the chair. Sir Charles Bathurst was present, and explained that trouble had arisen with the London Theatrical Managers&apos; Association, who objected to the sale of sweetmeats being allowed in some theatres while it was restricted in others. It was resolved that the sale of sweetmeats in all places of entertainment should be prohibited.Mr. Clynes informed the Council that he had submitted a memorandum to the War Cabinet on the question of meat subsidies, and had suggested the appointment of a committee to see if any scheme could be framed by extension of subsidies, to secure a greater measure of industrial peace. The reply received showed that the principle of extended subsidies was not viewed with favour, but the Cabinet desired further representations from him on the subject of the suggested committee, and these he proposed to furnish in due course. ,,     ,.       ..,The Food Controller further stated that he had received objections from retailers to the rationing of jam on the ground of the extra work which this would involve. They preferred registration as in the case of tea and they urged the difficulties of serving in small quantities. He had promised to discuss with the retailers the details of the proposed scheme. . ,:,Mr. Clynes, the Food Controller, addressed a Food Conference at Grosvenor House on Saturday afternoon on the administration of his department. Delegates were present from between 45 to 50 trade councils, 14 London Labour parties, 20 co-opera-tive societies and women;s co-operative guilds, and the London Food Vigilance Committee, in addition to Labour representatives from many Food Control Committees.In the course of his address the Food Controller referred to the rising- prices o;f certain essential articles of food such as milk and meat, and pointed out that difficulties were bound to grow because food imports were in direct competition with the imports of military material and soldiers. In the matter of meat prices, it must be remembered that we were driven almost on to a single market that of North America, the dearest market in the world.Mr. Olynes added that, in the course of the next week or 10 days, they hoped to issue a new list of fish prices which would effect a reduction of 15 to 25 per cent, among the class of ordinary white fish.Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.(1) The Milk (Winter Prices) Order, 1918, dated 17th September 1918, fixes maximum wholesale and retail prices of milk for the winter months. The retail price from October 1st to November 21st is to be 9d. per quart, and from November 22nd to April 30th, 1919, lOd. per quart. These prices are subject to variation by Local Food Committees. From October 1st to April 30th, 1919, the maximum wholesale price that may be paid to producers is 2s. 3d. per imperial gailon, in addition to any railway charges. The maximum wholesale prices, in the case of persons other than producers, are \d. per gallon above&apos; the price paid to the producer in the case of milk
delivered by the producer in accordance with the directions of the seller ; 2s. 5cZ. per gallon, pins railway charges, in the case of milk delivered to the buyers&apos; railway station, and 2s. 1\d. when delivered to the buyers&apos; premises.(2) The Bones (Licensing of Purchasers) Order, 1918, dated 23rd September 1918, provides that no one shall, after 14th October 1918, buy, grind, or treat any beef, veal, mutton, pork, or horse bones, except under licence, with the exception of (a) bones acquired for the purpose of human or animal consumption by domestic consumers, caterers, residential establishments and institutions ; (b) sales and pur-&apos; chases of meat by butchers in the ordinary course of trade ; (c) bones sold to itinerant collectors or barrowmen.(3) The Bones (Maximum Prices). Order, 1918, dated September 23rd, 19.18, fixes ,maximum, prices for beef, veal, mutton, and horse bones.(4) The Bones (Requisition) Order, 1918, dated September 23rd, 1918, provides that the occupiers of all factories engaged in grinding or treating beef, veal, mutton, pork or horse bones shall place at the disposal of the Food Controller the resultant products of their factories in existence on October 14th, and the future output. Proper accounts must be kept, and necessary returns rendered.(5) The Apples and Perry Pears (Sales) Order, 1918, dated September 23rd, 1918, controls the prices of apples and perry pears. The maximum retail price per lb. of all apples, other than jam apples, i.e., apples which will pass through a two-inch ring, and certain specified varieties, will be, in September, Id.; in October and November, Sd.; in December and January, 9d.; in February and after, lid. Jam apples may only be sold to manufacturers of jam, pulp, or cider, and may be only used for cider under licence.   The Small Apple (Temporary Prices) Order, 1918, is cancelled.&apos;.: . (6) The Horseflesh (Sales) Order, 1918, dated 24th September 1918, provides for the licensing of all slaughter-houses for horses, either as horse butcheries where only horses passed as fit for human consumption may be slaughtered, or as knackeries. All wholesale dealers in horseflesh must be licensed, and retailers must be registered with the Local Food Committees. The object of the Order is to ensure a full utilisation of all horse products, and also that all horseflesh for human consumption shall be prepared under sanitary conditions.Supplies and Prices.&apos; &apos;-: Bacon.-It appears possible that there will be an appreciable quantity of Irish bacon available for export to Great Britain in the next few months, and the required arrangements are being made to bring such bacon into the general scheme of distribution in Great Britain.&apos; Gold Storage. The position just now is fairly satisfactory. The total capacity at &quot;the present time is 35^ million cubic feet, and accommodation under construction will increase this to 42 million cubic feet by the end of May 1919. Treasury sanction has further been granted for the erection by the Government of an additional 8 million cubic feet which will be provided in large units at the most important centres of distribution.; DriedFruits. The Ministry is in communication with the G.O.C., Mesopotamia, with a view to his fixing maximum prices for this year&apos;s crop of Persian dates.Shipment is reported of the first portion of the 2,000 tons 1917 crop sultanas purchased in America. Bad weather has damaged this year&apos;s crops of Californian dried fruits, but. it is hoped that this will not affect this Ministry&apos;s requirements which are now- being allocated by the American Food Administration.Further small quantities of dried fruits have been issued to the Central Prisoners of War and other organisations for making Christmas puddings.Meat. Certain protests have been received against the advance in the retail prices for meat, but it is not thought that these will give rise to any serious discontent. ; A chart has been prepared showing graphically the comparison between the prices . for meat in this country and in allied^ neutral, and enemy countries, which shows that meat is still cheaper in the United Kingdom than in any other country. &apos;Milk. The Financial Advisory Committee in connection with the control of milk has reported to the Food Controller on &quot; the financial arrangements to be made with &quot;manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, in connection with the. scheme., for the &quot; control of milk distribution, and to recommend the best means of securing that anym
&apos; &quot;increase in the value of their business clue to the operation of Government control &quot; may accrue to the State.&quot; .On the assumption that the Ministry of Food would take over the wholesale milk trade, the Committee recommended : (1) That manufacturers and owners of factories whose businesses are tempo-rarily taken over by the Ministry of Food should, with certain exceptions, receive a fixed income equal to the standard rate of profit fixed for the purpose of Excess Profits Duty, together with 20 per cent, of the average of the additional net profits earned, if any. &apos;(2) That in order to secure that any increase in value due to the operation of control may accrue to the State, the Ministry of Food should secure in agreements with trading concerns the option to purchase during or after the period of control and should ask for Parliamentary powers of com-pulsory purchase in case of failure to obtain such optiens.(3) That the value of a concern for the purpose of an option to purchase shall be ascertained as follows : Capitalisation of true commercial profit that a concern is normally capable of earning by a factor representing the value of the security for the maintenance of that profit; the purchase price to include all assets : used in and for the purpose of the business, and additional sums to be paid for certain specified assets.(4) That in the case of the United Dairies, Ltd., the Ministry should obtain an option to purchase, or, in the event of failure to do so, should obtain Parliamentary powers of compulsory purchase; the datum period for wholesale portion of business from August 10th, 1915, to 31st March 1918; for retail businesses, September 1917 to date of assumption of control; multiplier to be settled by negotiation, due regard being had to possible legislation ; and the purchase price to include all assets used in business, other assets to be valued and paid for separately.Enforcement of Orders.&apos;There are ninety-four more prosecutions registered this week than last. : The total for the week is 658, of which 614 resulted in, convictions ; 285 of the cases came&apos; from Ireland with 95 per cent/ of convictions.The number of Orders in respect of which prosecutions were instituted was &quot;61.The average fine has decreased by 11. 10s. for England, Scotland and Wales, and by 2s. for Ireland. ..........    -PART IL-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Attention must be directed to the increased consumption of bread and flour as shown in the following paragraphs and tables (Tables E. and J.)Imports.Imports for the week ending September 21st showed a considerable recovery from the low record of the first two weeks of the cereal year (Table A). The total :weight; of i the principal foods and feeding-stuffs imported was 205,700 tons, as compared with 140,300 tons, the week before and 200,300 tons a year ago. The improvement was mainly attributable to the arrival of larger consignments of cereals ; at the same time several of the other items showed not unsubstantial increases. The larger receipts of beef and mutton are particularly welcome.The import of wheat and wheaten flour was the largest for. any week since May, and somewhat more than a week&apos;s current consumption. In equivalent grain the improvement was 49,200 tons on the previous week and 52,200 tons on the corre-sponding week of 1917. No rice at all arrived, but the stock is good, and other cereals, that is barley, oats and, maize, all rose considerably and taken together increased on the week from 15,600 tons to 31,100 tons. During the week ending September 22nd, 1917, 14,100 tons of rice were imported, and much larger quantities of maize and oats than this year.Bacon at less than 6,700 tons was a conspicuously small import. Other ;meats were markedly higher. Beef rose from 1,800 tons to 8,800 tons; mutton from 200 tons to 4,500 tons; and unspecified meat from 1,800 tons to 2,200 tons. Including bacon, the total for all meat was 1,300 tons lower than a year before.i.  6467-4 e
For the first time during the past three months a normal quantity of butter arrived. The importation, under 2,600 tons, represents little more than a week&apos;s consumption, and yet is nearly double total imports for the previous ten weeks. Cheese and condensed milk, although showing substantial falls, were at a fairly adequate level.   Lard increased to 2,900 tons, a figure slightly above average.&apos; Sugar fell 500 tons from 27,400 tons to 26,900 tons ; 45,900 tons arrived in the week ending September 22nd, 1917. Tea, coffee, cocoa were each lower, but a temporary deficiency in tea is not serious, and the import of cocoa was still much above the average of the previous weeks of the year.Consumption.Meat-Reports from the markets show generally a definite increase in the number of animals coming forward for slaughter (Table C). There are indications that the increase in supplies following the gathering of the harvest is greater this year than normally. It would appear that the rising scale of prices to farmers will not be sufficient to counteract the feared shortage of feeding-stuffs, with the result that a repetition of last year&apos;s events, excessive supplies in the autumn and consequent dearth in the spring, is not unlikely.Bread and Flour. Returns made by bakers and retailers of flour show a marked increase .in consumption for the four weeks ended September 14th (Table E). As compared with the previous four weeks, the increase amounted to 4 per cent., and as compared with the corresponding period of 1917 to no less than 12 per cent. The index is now higher than it has been at any time since March 1917. Higher consumption was to be anticipated as the colder weather approaches, but an increase of the magnitude recorded for the past month was not expected so early in the year. The situation will have to be carefully watched, for it suggests that the need for strict economy is being less generally recognised. In all parts of the country is the increase in consumption to be observed and though not everywhere to exactly the same extent, the differences are such as might be explained by movements of the holiday population (Table J). Stocks held by bakers are in the aggregate unchanged. Consumption of flour by biscuit makers has also increased above both last month&apos;s figures and those of a year ago.

Supplies of fish at Billingsgate Market have decreased steadily since the end of August. As compared with a total of 2,589 tons for the week ended August 31st, the quantity passing through the market during the week ended September 21st was only 1,732 tons.Milk. The milk index has recommenced its fall, but slowly as yet. For the week ended September 14th it stood at 2 points above the average for the whole of September 1917.Stocks.During the first fortnight of September stocks of meat and provisions have undergone few important changes. Apart from a fall of over 8,000 tons in beef and mutton, the only noticeable movements have been a further fall in butter to 14,200 tons, and a continued growth in the stocks of lard to 27,800 tons. On September 21st, stocks of sugar stood at 394,000 tons.
