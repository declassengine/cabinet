NATIONAL SECURITY BILL.

MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.

1. For the purpose of preventing Espionage and the commission by enemy agents of other acts prejudicial to the interests of the State and the safety of the Realm, it has been found necessary during the War to supplement the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, 1911, by special powers under the Defence of the Realm Act and the Regulation thereunder, and during demobilisation it is essential that some at least of these powers should be maintained.

Apart, however, from the special conditions obtaining during actual hostilities and the period of demobilisation, the Official Secrets Act requires amendment.

2. Experience gained during the war has shown that a number of acts, the commission of which may have results prejudicial to the State, are not oovered by any of the provisions of the Official Secrets Act and in some cases where they are so covered, the penalties imposed are totally inadequate, bearing in mind the extreme gravity to the State of the consequences of the commission of such acts. A War Office departmental Committee which has been considering the question of the need for retaining any portions of the Emergency Legislation after the war, has drafted a Bill, entitled the National Security Bill, which is intended to supply the deficiencies of the present Act. This Bill is founded upon the terms of the Act, and the alterations are designed to strengthen It. They include an increase of the penalties imposed, and make provision for the following mutters:-

(i) Care of secret documents, models and plans.

(ii) Fulse repreaentation or statements, forgery, impersonation, mis-use of Official passes and Government dies.(iii) Communications with spies (Hot?: the Official Secrets Act provides restrictions on the activity of spies but does not give any power to deal with persons who are in communication with spite).

(iv) Supplying inducemente for the purpose of obtaining prejudicial Information.

(v) Obstructing authorities in the exercise of their duties under the Act.

(vi) Excluding the public from trials where publication ef the evidence to be given may be detrimental to the State.

3. A copy of the draft Bill and the Report of the War Office Emergency legislation Committee thereon are attached, and the War Cabinet are asked to sanction the initiation of legislation on the subject. When the Bill becomes an Act, it will be possible to dispense with some of the Regulations which have been recommended for continuance during the period of demobilisation.

THIRD INTERIM REPORT OF THE WAR OFFICE EMERGENCYLEGISLATION COMMITTEE.1. In paragraph 40 of our First Interim Report, issued on the 4th April, 1918, we pointed out that during the war the Directorate of Special Intelligence had been working under the Defence of the Realm Regulations to the practical exclusion of the Official Secrets Act, 1911, and that serious inconvenience would arise should it become necessary to deal with foreign agents during the period of demobilization, partly under the continuing provisions of the Defence of the Realm Regulations and partly under the Official Secrets Act.. We also stated that the Directorate were submitting proposals to us for the re-enactment of the Official Secrets Act in an extended form, but pending such proposed new legislation,, we recommended that the&apos; appropriate provisions of the Defence of the Realm Regulations should be maintained during demobilization, for the purpose of bridging the interval between war conditions and normal conditions.2. The Directorate duly submitted their proposals, which have been embodied in a Bill styled the &quot; National Security Bill,&quot; the draft of which is printed as an Appendix to this report.3. We are of the opinion that the penalties imposed by the Official Secrets Act are insufficient, bearing in mind, the extreme gravity to the State of some of the offences dealt with therein.Furthermore, experience gained immediately prior to and during the war has shown that a number of acts, the commission of Avhich may huve the most prejudicial results, are not covered by any of the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, and persons committing such acts could not be dealt with until Defence of the Realm Regulations, covering such offences, had been brought into force.4. The Bill incorporates the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, and those provisions of the Defence of the Realm Regulations which deal with matters of a similar nature, and Avhich, in the light of past experience, will be necessary for preserving the safety and interests of the State after the war.5. Clauses 1, 2 (except sub-section (i.) (c)), 3,8,9,10,11,12,13, 1.4,16 and 17, are substantially re-enactments of corresponding provisions in the Official Secrets Act (except in so far as they are necessarily amended by reason of the development of new instruments of warfare) and do not therefore require any comment.Alterations in and amendments to the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, are indicated in the text of the National Security Bill by underlining.(i. Clauses 2 sub-section (i.) (c), 4, 5, 6, 7 and 15 deal Avith acts which are not covered by the provisions of the Official Secrets Act. These clauses, Avhich are extensions of the Official Secrets Act, are indicated in the text of the National Security Bill by side lines.7. The main features of the proposed extensions are as folloAvs: (i.) Care of secret documents, models and plans. The loss through carelessness of a secret document may have consequences just as serious to the interests of the State as the intentional disclosure of the contents of such document, and Ave recommend cases of this nature should be provided for.   (See clause 2 (i) (c).)(ii.) False representations or statements, forgeiy, personation, misuse of passes or Government dies.  Acts of this nature are not covered by the Official Secrets Act, and Avhere such acts are committed for the purpose of gaining admission to a prohibited place, or for any other purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State, Ave consider that they should be made offences under the Act.   (See clause 4.)(hi.) Communications with spies. The Official. Secrets Act provides restrictions on the activity of spies, but it does not give any power to deal Avith persons Avho are in communication Avith spies. Experience has shoAvn, that in many cases one of the most effective methods.of restricting the activity&apos; of spies is to curtail the opportunities they have of establishing channels of communication through which to obtain the information they require, and we recommend the extension of the Act to meet these cases.   (See clause 5.)(iv.) (a.) Applying inducements for the purpose of obtaining prejudicial information, (b) Obstructing Authorities in the exercise of their duties under the Act. Experience gained during the Avar has shown that the commission of acts of this nature may be fraught Avith serious consequences, and we recommend that some restriction should be placed thereon.   (See clauses b&apos; and 7.)(v.) Exclusion of public from trials. We recommend that a discretionary poAver should be given to a Court hearing cases under the Act, to exclude the public from all or any part of the proceedings, in vieAv of the serious consequences that might ensue in certain cases if the evidence necessary to ensure a conviction Avere made public.The effect of the publication of the evidence might sometimes be more harmful than the failure to prosecute the offender.
