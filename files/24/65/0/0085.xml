f24&quot;(This document la the property, of His BriWinio Maje-sVy&apos;8 $ol^rTiment;WAR     CABINET.I885. Ministry of Health Bill,IET.Memorandum by the Minister of Roconstruction on the Letter addressed to the Prime Minister by Mr, Rockliff as Secretary to the Joint Committee of Approved Societies (G.T.5856).1.    The Y/ar Cabinet will observe that In his letter-Mr. Rockliff does not&apos; profess to speak for the Approved Societies oonnected with Industrial Assurance Companies,   Nor does he correctly re-present the views of Labour as they have been conveyed to me .-. -by Mr. J,H,Thomas, with wh&amp;m I have been in close touch- throughout the negotiations on the Bill.   Nor does he speak for the Association of Insurance Ccmmittoes,: or for the bodies representing the medioal profession which have been consulted,24    The- objection of the Friendly Societies and himself to tho Bill in its present form arises out of two changes made in tho draft by the Home Affairs.Committee, namely:a, the insertion of the words &quot;Local Government&quot; in the titlesb. the deletion of a paragraph relating to the future administration of the Poor Law whioh stood in tho First Schedule,3.    These ohanges were not welcomed by the representatives ofother bodies referred to above, but they were acquiesced in bythem and will hot be taken as a ground for opposition to the Bill.4.    The Bill as It stood without these changes was supported bythe Friendly Societies1 representatives with whom I conferred,and by Mr. Rockliff.5,    Their support could again be secured by the omission of the words &quot;Local Government&quot; from the title, and tho- reinstatement of the paragraph&quot;relating to the future administration of tho Poor Law.    They attach undue importance to the insertion of this
250paragraph in the Bill, as Sir George CaveTs memorandum (&amp;..T..5760) shows; but in their view it is essential that the proposed declaration on Poor Law policy (G0lr\5569) should be made by the Minister In charge of the Bill, and that the paragraph which previously stood in the First Schedule should be restored to the Bill.This paragraph was as follows.&quot;In the event of provision being made by Act of &quot;Parliament passed in the present or any future session &quot;for the revision of th6 law relating to the relief of &quot;the poor and the distribution aaon^ot ether authorities &quot;of the powers exercisable by /boards of guardians, it &quot;shall be lawful for His Majesty by Order in Council to. &quot;transfer to other Government Departments any of the &quot;powers and duties under tho enactments relating to tho &quot;relief of the poor by this Act transferred to the &quot;Minister, except such as appear to His ilajesty to relate &quot;or to be incidental to the health of th9 people&quot;,C. ADDISON...5,10*18.
