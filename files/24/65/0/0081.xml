D/HS/X332 WW.fcttvlLlAKY OjP BLOCK ADS III FORMAT! OH2313rd Oct. 1918*   SWEDES.   Hegotiations are at present proceeding &quot;between the Swedish Government and Germany regarding the deliveries of German ooal to Sweden,     The Swedish quota for September was 133,000 tone; but the Swedish Government apprehend that they may not receive more than 75,000 tons in October.   Some difficulty has apparently arisen between Sweden and Germany regarding the G era an-Swedish Coal Agreement of April lest (Vide Summary Aug. 16th to  2nd).   The new negotiations are probably connected with the decision of the Swedish Government to stop certain exports to Germany which involve a breach of the American-Swedish Agreement (Summery Sept. 20th to  6th).g.DEN&amp;AKjC.   In view of the conclusion of the Danish American Agreement the general embargo on goods exported from the United iiingftora to Ben-mark will now be raised.   Danish importers will be allowed to import a full quarter1 &amp; sur/ply of goods rationed by the Agreement under new or under outstanding guarantees which have been confirmed by the Dan-ish Associations,   Embargoes imposed on soeolfio commodities for special reasons do not fall under this arrangement, but will continue to be dealt with on&apos;their merits.&amp;*gQBWAY. Sir U. Findlay believes that the new Norwegian loan to Ger-many is part of a general Gorman-Horv-egian Economic Agreement, but no particulars have as yet been obtained.   The interest to be wsid on this loan was finally fixed at 1$ above the discount rate of the Bank of Norway plus a quarterly commission of 14.tain a fair share of the materials imported Into liorway under the new Horvegian agreement, we ^ronose to ask the Horweftian Government to allot to these factories a fixed proportion of the current rationsIn order that Hor?egian factories working for the Allies may ob-
232 2-corresponding with their share of the total llorwogian Imports in 1916. Any additional supplies required by these factories would be sent to isiorway outside the rations.&quot; ^MM^MMh   f^&apos;bere has been a remarkable development during thewar of the Dutch coal mines at limburg, and in consequence of a greatly increased native output of fuel the Netherlands Government have recently been able to take up a more independent attitude in their economic negotiations? with Germany.    The present total annual out-put of the Limburg mines is estimated at 3,444,000 tons.    This output is supplemented by supplies of native lignite and peat.    The total production of fuel in the Netherlands Is now about 5,000,000 tons par . annum as compared with a minimum consumption of some 6,500,000 tons.Tho United states Government have suggested that it might further strengthen the hands of the !Dutch in their negotiations with Germany , if they were to offer to supply Holland with 100,000 tons of American coal to be fetched in Dutch vessels.    But the Batch could not safely send ships to fetch coal from the United States without first. coming to an Agreement as to safe conducts with the German Government.$vVITg^lAHfl,      The Swiss Government have put forward a scheme forfinancing imports into the United Kingdom of Swiss silks and embroid-eries and other Swiss luxury goods without depreciating the sterling   &quot;exchange.     They hope that this scheme will enable IIGovernment toreconsider the decision to prohibit these imports.   They propose thatthe goods should be paid for in sterling deposited in London,    Thissterling would be transmitted once a month to the Swiss national Sankat Berne, which would credit the British Importers with the equivalentparin.francs, of the sums Transmitted, reckoned at the/rate of exchange^Sn^iL.Sino3 February 5, sailing vessels have left Portugal with cargoes for Sweden without applying for facilities.    On August 30, the Swedish s.v. :,lelly k Mathilda&quot; arrived at Gothenburg having cleared from Lisbon and successfully run the blockade with a cargo og? wine,
cork, salt and oof fee.BRAZIL.    A scheme has been drafted at Washington for a closer eeono-( roio cooperation between Brazil and tho Allied Governments,    It is pro-posed that the Allies should assume responsibility for Brastre exter-nel debt;   that thoy should undertake to finance the Brazilian coffee and rubber arope and to purchase the Brazilian output of Manganese; that they should suspend application of the Allied Blacklists and allow Brazil, if necessary, a small loan for war purpesoe.    The Brazilian Government would be asked in rotufcn to admit the Allied Governments to a  -hare in tho control and allocation of Brazilian shipping (including  -the 11 ox. enemy ships not at present in service).    They would also be expected to liquidate German interests in Braail.    The above scheme will not be discussed with the Brazilian Government until the new Braailian Administration cornea into office.    &apos;i!he present Administration is not likely to take effective action against enemy interests in Braail.PBOPO^jD im^mATIOflAI, WiU COW.    A Beutral Conference willshortly be held at Copenhagen to disouse the possibility of setting up an international prize court to review the decisions of tho belli-gerent prise courts taken during the war.    Mr. Pearnley will attend the Conferones as President of the Norwegian shipping Association. He has informally enquired what the attitude - of H* M. Government would , be to the institution of an international court of appeal.   He stated&apos; that a strong line will be taken by the Conference against the German submarine campaign, and intimates that the Allied Governments would have little to lose by acoejrting the proposed Court..   Of the oases affecting Norway tried in the British Prize Court since war broke out there is only one against which the Norwegian shipowners desire to appeal.SBM, SSk&amp;SM QAiffAiGjj.
