(1).Reference No.25 th September. 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 24th September;-The Vteather and Condition of Crops.Heavy rains continued to fall throughout the country during the greater part of last week.    Very little carrying of corn was possible and the part of the crop still out is suffering very much. A great deal of corn is growing in the stocks, and the damage to corn in Wales, Cheshire and the Northern Counties is considerable. Roots and pasture land are generally much improved in condition and main crop potatoes have not, so far, been much damaged,LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Work of Agricultural Executive Committees. Herefordshire,    The Executive Committee have been authorised to take possession of a 200 acre farm near Pixley occupied, rent free, by a brother of the owner,    Most of the land is very foul, the fences are neglected and the gates falling to pieces.      The farm is capable of producing heavy crops, but the tenant, although he has plenty of capital and labour, has neither the energy nor the ability to cultivate it,    The farm will be let to&apos; a suitable tenant by the Executive Committee,Staffordshire.   An area of 240 acres known as Flaxley Green near Rugeley has be mi, in part, left uncultivated and ungraded for many years, but 150 acres have been cultivated comparatively recently. The whole area is at present under grass, large patches being over-grown with gorse,     It is owned by the Marquis of Anglesey, let to
the [tori of Shrewsbury and sublet to a tenant who formerly used if as a training ground for race-horses. This land has for some yeaj made no contribution to food production except for a small quantity of hay which has been supplied to pit ponies in the neighbourhood, After an inspection by a representative of the Technical -Division, the Executive Committee have been authorised to take possession of the land and&apos;to arrange for its cultivation, &quot;Prosecutions * A. farmer near Valsail in Worcestershire-has been fl  20 for non-compliance with an order to cultivate I875 acres of laiij Determination of Tenancies, During the week 7 Orders have been by the Board determining tenancies on account of bad farming, in respect of 67 acres,;     -HORTICULTURAL DIVISION, Provision of Land for Allotments,    Reports received during the h\ four weeks from 1,191 districts show that 2,303 plots containing acres have been provided under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 191 (No, 2).    The total number of applications, received is now 317,28 and 292,353 plots, comprising 21,184 acres have been provided.At Machynlleth each of trie 400 whouseholders, ,1s. growing, either in a garden or on an allotment,- -With a view to assisting small cultivators to&apos; overcome-the difficulties due to shortage of supplies of natural manure, a pamphlet on the subject of green manuring has been issued, and stfl have been taken to bring this subject to the attention Of all horticultural Sub-Committees, . * &apos;;The Department is conferring with the&quot; Royal Horticulturj Society with the object of securing uniformity of teaching, with respect to soil treatment by small cultivators,    - Active propaga) $a being undertaken to secure-.that the best information on this
subject shall be available to Panel Gardeners and Horticultural Representatives, who In turn, will hand it on to allotment holders and other small cultivators in the country. Marketing Organisation - The energies of the staff hove been directed towards consolidating the work which has already been undertaken by the County Marketing Societies, and for this purpose meetings have been held in Warwickshire, Bedfordshire, and Middlesex *TECHNICAL DIVISION. Inspection of Land.   Advice has been given as to the erection of silos and the cultivation of silage crops in connection with an important tract of dairy land near Petersfield.    The land in question carries 140 milch cows and extends to about 700 acres, of which from 150 to 200 acres are arable, the rest being pasture of the best description.     The soil is strong, only a small area of roots is grown, and it is considered that one or more silos would be distinctly useful.Germination of Newly-harvested Grain,   An investigation relative to the germination of newly-harvested grain has been undertaken at the Seed Testing StPtlon.     It has been found that grain sent to the Station immediately after having been threshed, or when &quot;hand threshed0 from the stack, frequently does not attain to.a high percentage of germination during the ten days normally allowed for the test, although most samples when kept in store for a further fourteen days before conducting the test, germinate well and rapidly.     It appears, however, that by drying the grain for about three days at 370 C. prior to testing, wheat, barley and rye may be made to germinate quite normally, but that this does not apply to oats.     The investigation is being continued,The total number of samples received at the Seed Testing Station since the beginning of the new season (1st August) amounts to 1,614,  - It is noteworthy that the number received last week reached 632, which is more than 100 in advance of the
highest total received during any one week of last season. 1; seedsmen have now opened deposit accounts at the Station.iUtilisation of Spent Garb ide Residues. Reports have been received on the results of experiments carried out for the Department at Rothamsted, Oxford and Garforth (Yorks), with th( object of ascertaining whether the residues from calcium car-bit after its use for the production of acetylene, can be 3afely ui as a source of lime for agricultural purposes. The experiment include both pot and plot tests, and the results uniformly ind that the residues can be safely used for the purpose even in a comparatively fresh condition, and will produce results equal: those obtained with an equivalent dressing of ground carbonate of lime.LABOUR DIVISION. Agricultural Labour and Military Service.    Instructions havei been issued in agreement with the Ministry of National Service and the Local Government Board as to the further occupations allied to agriculture to be protected by Agricultural Executivf Committees.    The additional men to be protected include, amon men principally and usually engaged as rabbit catchers, vermin killers, drainers, agricultural masons, bricklayers and carpen men engaged in willow farming and flax cultivation. Harvest Labour.   The number of soldiers specially released for harvest work now out on farms is 7,104.   Demands for additions men have been received from the northern counties, and have bei met, but in the southern counties soldiers:; whose furlough has expired are returning to their units on completion of harvest. Migratory ,gangs of prisoners comprising in all about 4,500 men still out with farmers, and their work is well spoken of. Soldier Labour.   In view of the decisions of the Agricultural Wages Board it has been found necessary to amend the conditions with regard to the payment of soldiers on farms in order to provide for a minimum cash payment of 12s, 6d. per week instead
10s. per week as hitherto.      The farmer will have the same right of appeal to the District Wages Committee to pay a lower wage, as in the case of his civilian employees.    An Army Council In.etruc1.jLcn embodying these amended conditions has been issued during the week.The number of soldiers now out on farms, exclusive of the men specially released for harvest work, is 62,094, as compared with 61,603 four weeks ago6to1 Agricultural Volunteers.   The number of War Agricultural Volunteers placed oh farm work to date is 3,529.    Four weeks ago the number was 2,863.    Many of the applicants for enrolment who have not yet been placed have been interviewed personally but found to be quite unsuitable for work on the land, Danes.   The Ministry of Labour are bringing over from Denmark, at fortnightly intervals, a small nujriber of Danish agriculturallabourers, etc who are being placed on agricultural work by the Ministry working in conjunction with this Department.    The number of these men placed to date is 167, namely 148 agriculturists and 9 blacksmiths.Prisoners of War.   During the last four weeks 15 additionalagricultural prisoner camps have been opened, making the totalnumber of prisoners now employed on farm or drainage work,exclusive of the men loaned for harvest work only, as follows.-Prom 327 agricultural camps ..........   19,006Employed from other camps ............    1,008Combatant prisoners lodged on farms *..     .  7420,886Released aliens employed inagriculture ........    2,27783,165Pour weeks ago the total was .........   22,18330 additional schemes providing for the employment of a further 1,678 prisoners in agriculture are under consideration by the War Office.
WOMEN&apos;S BRANCH.Employment *   Large gangs of women have been applied for for potato lifting in Lincolnshire, Shropshire, and Cheshire.   Harvest gangs have been asked for in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and a thresh scheme has been sanctioned this week for the West Riding.   In Denbighshire two women have cut 51 aores of thistles in 8 days, ttat total acreage cut being 254.Letters of appreciation of work done by members of the I Army are frequently received from farmers.   A Rent farmer, for example, writes as followsi*&quot;These girls have worked excellently and have proved thei selves worthy of the name of Britons and have done credit to the Women&apos;a Land Army. I trust you will express my feelings and ttocudl to the girls and also make it known to their fellow workers at the earliest possible chance when there Is a body met together. To i this public will give me the greatest satisfaction&quot;.15,94$ women are accounted for in the Land Army as folio-On farm work    ...     ...Lent to Forage DepartmentLent to Timber Supplies DepartmentIn Instruction Centres       ...     ..........Waiting for references to be placed In Training Centre s      ...     ...     ...     ......13,371 146 .    146 1,514149 305 31315,943Waiting in Depots      ...

Requisitions are being received from many comities for additional disc harrows.    In anticipation of this demand the Department placed an order in May for 1,300 disc harrows, but owing to delays in manufacture no deliveries have yet been made.      All steps have been taken to press the matter forward, but deliveries will inevitably be lute, although a commencement of deliveries is expeoted to be.made in a few weeks.Up to the 21st September, 2,369 of the Fordson tractors released&apos;to Messrs. Henry Ford and Bon had been dispatched to farmers.During the week ended 6th September 10,851 acres were ploughed, 662 acres were oross*ploughed and 3,817 acres were cultivated.Supply of Spare Parts for Tractors and horse-drawn Implements,    The   &apos; Ministry of Munitions&apos; factory at Manchester, from which spare parts for Fordson tractors and Oliver ploughs have hitherto been distributed, has been handed over to the Mechanical Warfare DepartmentsArrangements have for some time been in existence by which the concessionaires have undertaken the distribution of spare parts required by farmers for binders, drills, disc harrows, etc.,   and the Department have, therefore, always obtained locally the spares required for Government implements.     In tho case of tractors and tractor ploughs, however, it has previously not been possible to find any firms willing to undertake the supply of spare parts and at the seme time to  ive a guarantee of satisfactory service, Messrs. Henry Ford and ,son have, however, now entered into an agreement to take over the spare Pordson parts held&quot;by the Department and to undertake their distribution on a commercial basis both to the Department md to private users &quot;of -Fordson tractors, the Department rc?ceiving special terms.     The Oliver plough spare parts will in future be distributed from the Ease Supply Lepot,
Steojn Tackle, The acreage dealt with during &quot;the past week is aj follows:- ploughed 8,120 acres, cultivated. 21,053 acres, harroil 535 acres, mole-drained 27 acres. Total 29,533 acres. . Harvest Work. During the week-ended .6th September 3,232 &quot;tract days&apos;&quot; work we3 done by binders working with tractors.

Superphosphate.&apos; Deliveries of superphosphate for the three mont June-August have amounted to 46,000 tons as compared with 32,000 tons in the same period last year. Action is being taken to urg both farmers and dealers to take delivery early in the year and there is evidence that dealers are fully alive to the desirabilit of obtaining early delivery,Taking sulphate of ammonia, superphosphate and basic slag together, the deliveries in the first three months of the fertiliser year have been 40 per cent greater than in the same period last year,Lime. A firm of lime burners who were in a position to increase their output have undertaken to sell lime in the South West of l-ngland at agreed prices, and a number of the Agricultural Jtxecut&apos; Committees are drawing the attention of farmers to this source of supply. The lime in being sold through Approved- Agents, and the notices which have been published as to prices are having a very
B3L0bo-useful effect In keeping clown prices charged by other dealers and akers.    Other Agricultural Executive Committees are being encouraged to publish statements of the priceo at which lime is sold by different firms In their area, and in this way it is hoped to oheck the tendency towards increasing prices which is caused by the iemand for lime from iron and steel works.    It is difficult to ^Increase the output of lime to any extent owing to labour difficulties. k certain amount of protection has been obtained for men already ^in the industry, but this does not directly increase the number of nen employed, and practically the only source of additional labour eJavailable Is German prisoners.    Although considerable numbers of these men are employed their efficiency is much below that of the ordinary employee.Stable Manure,    The demand for stable manure during the year has been -ve&apos;y large, and practically all the accumulations of manure at rmy camps have been removed, the main exception being a very large dump at Eelmoor near Aldershot, which was formed early in the war, This dump is gradually being moved by barge to places along the Baslngstoke Canal, about 12,000 tons having been taken up to the present. The continual barging is having an effect on the banks of the Canal and considerable expenditure will be necessary in order to maintain the transportation of the manure,    This question is now being discussed with the War Office,Testing of Seeds Order,    The requirements of the revised Testing of)0 utfid,1ascu o tlnSeeds Order have now been brought to the notice of practically all seedsmen in the country, and so far as can be ascertained they are being observed In a satisfactory manner,    The Order also applies to sales of seeds between farmer and farmer, but this class of seller is very difficult to reach,    A large number of copies of the Order have been distributed to farmers, and notices have been published In the press, Arrangements are now being made&apos;through the Agricultural Executive Committees for placards drawing the attention of farmers to the [requirements of the Order to be displayed in markets and other places where farmers congregate,   ,
Seed Wheat. Although the weather has delayed threshing, those I growers who contracted to supply the Department with seed wheat have already placed samples of all varieties in the hands of Distributing Agents. -Wart Disease. A number of new outbreaks of wart disease have bi reported in London and the home counties, and further cases havi occurred in Hampshire, Somerset and Devon. In view of the prevalence of the disease inthe parishes of Cheshire bordering the Mersey, it has been found necessary to certify an infected area in this district, which will also Include the county boron of Stockport.Spraying. Potato blight has developed rapidly in the Reading district during the last few weeks. In East Allington (Devon) the spraying of potatoes has proved successful. The plots in this district were inspected recently and the growers are keenl alive to the gain which has resulted from the spraying carried this season.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, Director-General.The Rt. Hon, Rowland E* Prothero, M.P., President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
