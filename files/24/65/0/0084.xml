CONFIDENTIAL. [September 30, 1918 ]246Political  Intelligence  Department, Foreign Office.Russia /014.MEMORANDUM&apos; J Jl 11 h -    . ..-Ti-nz-nONREGENT  POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS  IN  SIBERIA.THE scope and conclusions of the following Memorandum, which is in con-tinuation of Memoranda C. 22 and 24 of the former Intelligence Bureau, Depart-ment of Information, are as follows: (a.) A sketch of the more recent political developments in Siberia up to the 30th September, which go to prove that that country has shown itself to be the most practicable centre from which to attempt the restoration of order in European Russia. From, the reasons set out in the foregoing memoranda it may confidently be expected that, although the sense of patriotism is poorly developed amongst Siberians, as amongst the Russian people as a whole, yet the various rival governments will, in the end, coalesce, particularly if a firm, impartial hand is shown by the Allies.(&amp;.) A sketch of the Czecho-Slovak outbreak, and their subsequent activities in Siberia, with evidence proving that any breach of faith lies to the account of the Bolshevik Government.In Memoranda C. 22 and 24 of the Intelligence Bureau, Department of Informa-tion, notes were given amongst other matters on the different elements that have entered into the composition of the population of Siberia, and the conclusion drawn that of all the various Slav elements inhabiting the Russian State, the Sibiriak was probably the one who would best look after the interests of his own country, in face of Bolshevik or German invader. In view of the foreshadowed early collapse of Bolshevism there, and the importance of Western Siberia and Archangel as centres from which to attempt the restoration of order in Russia, it may be of value to review the recent history and re-estimate the political and other possibilities in Siberia at the present moment. This history has been marked principally by the rapidity of the reaction against the Bolsheviks.The influence of the Bolshevik coup cVEtat, of the 9th November, 1917, in Petro-grad, slowly but definitely penetrated Siberia, producing similar results, though never to the same extent, and seems to have exhausted its possibilities for open and direct evil already by the end of September 1918. It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that in the population of Siberia the Allies will find material enthusiastic for the Allied aims, and patriotic to a degree very different from European Russia. The Sibiriak is, after all, a Russian with most of the weaknesses of the Russian temperament. Of the various elements in Siberia one and all tend to regard inter-vention largely as it affects their specific interests. The country has had no past of which it is proud. In consequence, there is no unified opinion, and an almost total absence of patriotism; the dominant desire is for order, from whatever quarter it may come. The really remarkable fact is that no individual has arisen either in Siberia or European Russia of outstanding merit who has been able to unite the country not even a Venizelos; in consequence, the personal jealousies of second-rate men have had full scope. Under the circumstances, the final settlement and restoration of the country as a whole look as if they might be matters of decades.Siberia is essentially democratic and Moderate Socialist (Menshevik) in com-plexion. There is neither aristocracy nor small nobility. The rich merchants have always played an unsatisfactory role, usually leaving the country after making a fortune, while such as have remained until the present time proved only too content to buy off the Bolsheviks, if it seemed possible in that way to avoid a fight in their town and the destruction oi their property, rather than give any assistance to the Cossacks and to the cadet-officers who organised such resistance as was made.  TheIntroduction.[367-44]B
Government officials likewise proved themselves unable or unwilling to take any initiative, and public opinion lias been mainly formed- by the political exiles and some of the &quot;members of the staff of Tomsk University. Yet hardly anything was actually done when the first Bolshevik outburst swept through the country. Opposition in speech was put up by younger men with advanced social views, who saw where Bolshevism would lead, and passively by the peasants, who hated the disorder, but were too ignorant to have deeply reasoned opinions. Further, the latter had made money, had become thoroughly selfish, and lost all confidence in every-one. The peasants may prove to be difficult elements to handle separately, but can be reached through their co-operative societies, in the management of which the best individuals amongst them find a place. The Cossacks, of whom the younger men are not as their fathers, have proved to be somewhat disappointing on the whole. There are some 35,000 of them in Amuria; but although their rally to the side of order has not been conspicuous so far as numbers.go, they can still be counted upon as an element favourable to the purposes of Intervention.Bolshevism in Siberia has been represented mainly by disbanded soldiers, dis-charged convicts., and certain classes of workmen, notably miners and those employed ,in the railway workshops.   The Artels, or unions, of railway and telegraph workers, are not nearly so extreme.!,.and might be influenced, as their views are not really, those of the Bolsheviks proper,The,Bolsheviks&apos; in Siberia, have proved to be negligible as a fighting force, as was anticipated,, and had latterly maintained their control in Siberia principally ,by the help of German and Austrian prisoners of war. The German penetration of Western Siberia)was&apos; accomplished not onlyfby means of the war prisoners, but also -bv\venai,agents,&apos; mainly Jews, and civilian prisoners, who had been deported from Jiuropean. Russia ^t!the.&apos;oiitbreak&apos;p;f war and set down in the central governments of Siberia with&apos;only a pretence of internment.The Soviet, e.g., in Amuria came into marked unpopularity as soon as it attempted to fix the size of peasant holdings at 40 dessiatines, many peasants having holdings exceeding that amount. The Bolsheviks had also attempted to fix the price , of grain, but were unable to carry put their undertaking to supply the peasants with other goods at, a (pro. ratareduction in price.&apos;&apos; Bolshevik, attempts at nationalisation in Siberia have not proved successful, particularly in the East,&quot; where their methods ,have been everywhere characterised &quot;by extravagance and wastefulness. This, how-eyer, is,not to be wondered at, when regard is&apos;had to the&apos;type of personality tliat usually composed these Soviets.The /present economic, significance of Western Siberia (c/. Memoranda C. 22 and. 24) ,may,.j)e further gathered from one pr two casual incidents that have .happened; recently. Thus, on, the 1st June, 10,000 puds of unwashed Australian merino wool and,50,000 puds of flaxwere offered by the Siberian Co-operative Societies to His Majesty&apos;s Consul, at yladivbstpck. ,Later telegrams continue to emphasise,the,large supplies, in Siberia, &quot;e.g^,&apos;12&apos;iriilli^ri/hides and 70,000 ; puds of wool awaiting a market. /If, the &apos;fo&apos;ofl situation had&apos;; latterly &apos;not seemed quite wo,bright because, of the large demands&apos;from,&apos;European&quot;Russia,&apos;and the uncertain prospects for the 1918 crop owing &quot;to the&apos; late&apos; frosts and the , fact that less land is. now under cultivation, still the(1917 harvest Nyas&quot;the. best in ;the last&apos;ten years, while that of 1910 is still largely untouched. There has also, been no great diminution in the herds of cattle in Western, Siberia, and the.dairyindustry con-tinues,torthrive. ,,It./may be, ta^en for granted, in, view of what is. known of the resources of Western:Liberia, that.a primary German aim has been the control of the Trans-Siberian Railway as far,, at any rate, a;s, Irkutsk, with theview,of pbtain-ing,economic control p.f Western $iberia,^and so preventing imports from the&quot;&quot;East to compete with German; goods; in this way an/exclusive . Germanmarket&apos;. could&apos;be&apos; &quot;developed in , Western Siberia. On, the other hand, amongst the aims of Siberians for their country after the war are the, following: (1),creation .of&quot;an! industrial centre in the Altai; (2) development of colonies of peasant landholdersin the east; (3). strengthening of Siberian trade with Persia ,and Mongolia; (4) limitation of imports of agricultural and other machinery from abroad.&apos; Political Developments.As^oneVfthe principal difficulties with, which the Allied Governments have been&quot; faced is the rivalry&apos; between the different Governments claiming authority in
247Siberia, it is important to trace the origin of the competing bodies. A conference, was held at Tomsk on the 15th December, 1917, attended by delegates representing the towns, provinces, co-operative organisations, peasants, workmen, soldiers, Cossacks, and the local university. It elected a Siberian Provisional Government which was represented by the Siberian Provisional Council, composed of Professor (Potanine (President) Messrs. Derber, Yermakoff, ZakharofT, and.others. On the 25th January, in connnection with it, the session of a Siberian Duma was opened at Tomsk, the members of which, however, were more co-opted than elected. The intention was that it should act as the legislative Siberian organ till the convocation of the Siberian Constituent Assembly. The seat of the Government was fixed at Omsk. About the 19th of February some of&apos; its members were arrested and imprisoned in Krasnoyarsk.   Others escaped to Harbin and Vladivostock.It seems that on the 18th March the Controller of the Chinese Eastern Railway, General Horvat, told his Majesty&apos;s Consul at Harbin of his intention to place him-self at the head of a new provisional governmental organisation which he and others proposed to establish in place of the Far Eastern Committee^ (of which he was a member), and the Provisional Government of Siberia, inaugurated at Tomsk, but now defunct. His idea was that the Japanese elements under Allied intervention should assist Semenov, who could not march on Tchita unaided, and that the (probably) less numerous British and American elements should hold the line Vladivostock to Habarovsk . His Provisional Siberian Government, installed at Harbin, would forestall any necessity for the establishment of Japanese civil admin-istration. Further, it would form a good recruiting centre, which, in view of the fact that Semenov&apos;s total force was only 1,147 at this time, was a matter of some consequence. There is no doubt that amongst the ideas underlying Horvat&apos;s activity was the desire to set up a new revolutionary government in the Far East in order to compel Russia to fulfil her duty to the Allies, to prevent the eastward spread of Germany&apos;s power, and to control the war material to be found throughout Siberia. But he also looked on himself as the only legal representative of the Russian Pro-visional Government of 1917, and whilst the men he proposed to associate with him represented all classes, he maintained that they were the only men in the country with administrative experience. Subsequent events have fully confirmed the opinion formed at that time by His Majesty&apos;s Consul, viz., that Horvat&apos;s interests were primarily personal, and that his real ambition was to get ahead of his rival, the Russian Consul-General at Harbin, who was the moving spirit in the Far Eastern Committee. He was also anxious to re-establish more definitely the interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway. With him, at the beginning in particular, were associated Putiloff (Finance), Ustrugoff (Ways and Communications), and Koltchak (War and Marine).On the 27th March the Bolsheviks seized the post and telegraph offices at Vladivostock, but as that fortress was under the guns of foreign warships, their activities were never carried to such excesses as were common in almost every other centre where they took control. Their occupancy of Vladivostock was marked at once by the despatch eastwards of some of the military stores to the German-Bolshevik forces which were being organised at Irkutsk, as also to Habarovsk. Tchita at this time was securely in their hands. From this date onwards constant references are made in the telegrams to concentrations of German and Austrian prisoners of war and their movements, although no satisfactory idea of their numbers in the different localities is obtainable from the very varying reports that came through from time to time. According to a statement of the Japanese Minister of War, there &quot;The Times,&quot; were 94,000 east of Lake Baikal and 60,000 west of the lake about this time. A later Mar-19&apos;1918, estimate put the figure at 250,000, mostly unarmed, of whom 40,000 were stated to be in Omsk, while the others were now circulating freely. A certain proportion, estimated at 15,000 to 20,000, chiefly Magyars, were reported to have joined the Bolshevik Red Guards as Internationalists, and formed the direct mainstay of their supremacy in Siberia.The discipline in Semenov&apos;s force, which he first organised at the frontier station known as Manchuria, towards the end of December 1917, was never very remarkable, including as it did at this time Chinese ex-bandits.  Accordingly, he* The Par Eastern Committee had been formed at Harbin some time previously in order to combatManxiety and the dangers due to the presence of enemy prisoners in Siberia, and to eventually ensure the regular free elecrion of the Constituent Assembly. In particular its aim was to protect the Chinese Eastern Eailway and the interests of the Russo-Asiatic Bank. The Committee also claimed to be in touch with the various Siberian provinces and to represent the real base on which Semenov&apos;s expedition depended[367-44] B 2
4associated with himself, as Chief of Staff, General Shilnikoff, a Trans-Baikal   j Cossack, for the purpose of better mobilising the Cossacks, and Mr. Taskin, a Trans-Baikal member of the Constituent Assembly, to aid him on the. civil side. \On the 5th April British and Japanese forces landed at Vladivostock for the  j sole purpose of securing the lives and property of foreign subjects there, an armed I attack having been made the previous day on certain Japanese office employes.The Siberian Government at Vladivostock, which had just been organised, in direct continuity with the previous government at Tomsk, issued a proclamation on the 7th April, stating that &apos;;the Siberian Provisional Duma, composed of repre-sentatives of Zemstvos towns, co-operative societies, and other public organisations and nationalities, have organised a Government of autonomous Siberia.&quot;This Government, under the initial presidency of Derber, with Moravski as Secretary of State (eventually Lavroff became President, and Derber acted as Foreig7i Secretary) was representative of all the socialist factions, except the Bolsheviks, but had no material force behind it, and owed the possibility of its existence largely to the presence of the Allies. The principal points in its programme were the restora-tion of law and order, opposition to the Bolshevik regime, the summoning of the Constituent Assembly, assurance of the autonomy and territorial integrity of Siberia, support of the Allies, and active hostilities against Germany.This period&quot; coincided with the days when His Majesty&apos;s agent in Moscow believed that it might still be possible to persuade the Bolsheviks to make common cause with the Allies against Germany, and accordingly nothing was done in the way of encouraging active movements against the Bolsheviks by Semenov or others; in fact every effort was made to restrain him. The Bolsheviks under their system of blackmail and requisitioning, which was more extreme and methodical than in Russia owing to the more limited constituency on which it could be practised, endeavoured to raise additional forces at Krasnoyarsk to march against Semenov, but their efforts roused little enthusiasm. This place, together with Irkutsk, Tchita, Nikolsk, and Habarovsk in fact all the larger centres now began to be active foci of Bolshevik and German-Austrian concentration. One report refers to 110 German officers distributed along the railway lines dealing with the examination, &amp;c, of prisoners.The next incident in Vladivostock was a final trial of strength between the Bolsheviks and the local Government. On the 16th May they dissolved the Zemstvo for the Maritime Provinces, and discharged the Vladivostock mayor and municipality. As yet no other body was in a position to resist such action by force, and it only roused indignation amongst all classes of the community, with the excep-tion of the dockers and unskilled labourers. This showed itself most markedly in a largely attended public demonstration on the 29th May. Changing dispositions of Bolshevik and German-Austrian ex-prisoners, the entry of the Czecho-Slovaks. Semenov&apos;s withdrawal on the Chinese frontier during a period of reorganisation of his army, were all going on whilst the various considerations in connection with the question of intervention were being weighed by the Allied Powers. Meanwhile, appeals for Allied intervention to restore order in Siberia and oppose the Germans, were passed at meetings of the industrial classes and others held at Harbin and. elsewhere (June 18th). With the arrival of the Czecho-Slovaks at Vladivostock, the Provisional Siberian Government, representative of Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries, came out again into the open, and its programme was well received in spite of the comparative obscurity of its personnel. Notwithstanding all this, the Bolsheviks were able to obtain a bare majority at the new municipal elections (July 3rd) in a town that had never suffered as others had from their excesses, owing to the restraining presence of foreign warships and the fear of Japanese interven-tion. A telegram of the 8th July refers to a &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; movement started at Omsk and headed by the Grand Duke Michael. The details are scanty, but it is apparent that this town had again become a strong centre of anti-Bolshevik activity.The Czecho-Slovak successes had now stimulated General Horvat into greater activity,, and with the definite promulgation of the intentions of his Government, he left Harbin for- Nikolsk where the Czecho-Slovaks had arrived.  He then issued a proclamation in which he described himself as the sole representative in office of the former Russian Provisional Government, and assumed the title of &quot;Pravitel&quot; m (provisional administrator), assisted by a working cabinet.  Kalmikoff, Ataman of j the Ussuri Cossacks, who accompanied Horvat on this tour, aroused intense indigna- j tion by ordering a mobilisation of the Cossacks. Nowhere did the peasants show any [ desire to fight. I
5248On the 16th July, the Foreign Secretary of the Provisional Siberian Government at Vladivostock addressed a request to the representatives of the Allied Governments &quot; to enter into relations with him on the subject of the common front and the organisa-tion of a new Russo-German front. The reply was to the effect that the aim of His i Majesty&apos;s Government and the Allies was &quot; to secure the political and economic restoration of Russia without internal interference of any kind, and to bring about the expulsion of enemy forces from-Russian soil.&quot; A similar request for support and recognition was also proffered by Horvafs Government. Unfortunately the relations between the two Siberian Governments, which were never good, did not improve. The Moderate Socialist Government at Vladivostock, which was the more popular of the two, however, declared itself ready to enter into an agreement with General Horvat. The position of the Allies was beginning to suffer from the fears of the local population that they were going to be betrayed to General Horvat, whose sympathies were strongly to the Right. The Bolsheviks took advantage of the situation to work up strikes directed alike against Horvat and the Allies. Matters were not improved by the arrival of Horvat at Vladivostock on&apos; the 5th August accompanied by fifty armed officers, a procedure which was contrary to the regula-tions laid down by the Czech commander, General Dietrichs, for the preservation of order in the town.Attempts at a compromise between the rival Governments became less and less sincere as far as Horvat was concerned, whilst his manner became more and more dictatorial, which was all the more reprehensible inasmuch as, while the rival Government could claim that it had been elected by all except the propertied class, his Government was solely the result of personal nomination. The climax was reached when a small volunteer military force, which had been organised under the direction of the local Zemstvo and the municipality, and which was sympathetic with the Socialist Government, was claimed by proclamation as part of General Horvafs administration by his military commander, Pleshkoff. Such a violent defiance of the conditions requisite for the maintenance of order, which the Allied representatives were endeavouring to preserve in the city, had to be dealt with in face of the irrita-tion produced by it amongst the populace, and in the end the force in question was disarmed on the 25th August.With the reopening of communication-, news was received&apos; of political confer -ences in Western Siberia and Eastern Russia pointing to the re-establishment of a Government at Omsk similar to that. previously existing there, and sympathetic to the idea&apos;of the Constituent Assembly. This Government rapidly developed strength under the Premiership of Vologodski. Later, a conference held at Ufa (September 13th onwards) resulted in the formation of a Central Government, which will&apos;be responsible to the other Provincial Governments (Omsk, Samara, &amp;c.) and repre-sentative institutions (e.g., Society for the Regeneration of Russia, &amp;c). Its Executive Council includes Vologodski and Orksenlieff, and will hold office till the summoning of the Constituent Assembly. General Horvat has thrown in his lot with the Omsk Government, and will hold office under them in the Far East, while the Vladivostock Government has resigned.The Czechoslovak Outbreak.After the Treaty of &quot;Brest-Litovsk, Hvhen it became clear that Russia and the &apos; Ukraine &quot;wbiild&apos; hot&apos;&apos; fightyGemuny&apos; &quot;any&apos; longer,&apos; &quot;aii ^agreement was made with the Allied Governments that the Cze:cho-Sl0Vak&quot;forces in&quot; Russia should join the Allies on the Western front. On the 16th February, the promise of a free passage through &apos; Russia was given by the Bolshevik&apos; Commander-in-Chief,&apos; and a formal agreement &quot; entered &apos; into with &apos; the&quot; Bolshevik&apos; Government in Moscow &quot;on the&apos; 26th &apos; March.&apos; : Apparently, however\ the Bolshevik Government broke faith at the instigation of the Central&apos;Powers.   The only chance for the Czechoslovaks to get across Siberia, &apos; which was their chief&quot; desire, lay in the maintenance of good relations with, the &apos; Bolsheviks5, and to&apos;this end they had willingly pledged&apos; their absolute neutrality in all internal matters, nor had they any desire to take up&apos;arms1 a&apos;gainst their kinsmen. In the beginning of March their fighting forces in Siberia numbered at least two divisions of 20,000 each, and these with some 5,000 volunteers were distributed at various points along the Trans-Siberian Railway in process of transport to Vladi-vostock, when the change in orientation on the part of the Bolshevik Government took place.
6First-hand evidence is now available of the situation on the 26th May on the arrival of an echelon of Czecho-Slovak artillery at Irkutsk. They were armed with only thirty carbines and some grenades, having left the bulk of their arms by agree-ment with the Bolsheviks at Penza. A demand was made for the surrender of their remaining arms, retained for self-defence, by a large force of Red Guards, and whilst the unarmed Czecho-Slovaks were discussing the situation on the railway platform within the period of 15 minutes granted to them for the surrender, a machine gun opened fire on them from the station building. With the aid of their grenades they seem to have mastered the situation, disarmed their opponents, and succeeded in overcoming additional forces, which were sent against them by the local Soviet.Already by the 6th June, the Czecho-Slovaks were in possession of the stations-between Omsk and Krasnoyarsk, while the activities of their compatriots in European Russia met with corresponding success. Quickly their control extended eastwards to Nijni-Udinsk, and Penza in the west, Irkutsk remaining in Bolshevik hands till the 13th July. On the 28th June, Vladivostcck passed under Czecho-Slovak control, and they at once took steps for the preservation of order by disarming opposing forces. By the 6th July they began to move out on Nikolsk, with Harbin and Habarovsk as ultimate objectives. Semenov wanted to advance on Tchita with the object of drawing off the Bolshevik forces, but General Horvafs promised reinforcements did not appear. By the 4th July, Nikolsk was taken by the Czechs, and the Bolsheviks retired on Habarovsk. By the 11th July the sweep of Czecho-Slovak activity ranged from the Volga to Nijni-Udinsk. They had won the sympathy of the peasants, and the United States officials on the spot who had been opposed to the idea of intervention against the Bolsheviks, now considered it opportune in the interests of the Czechs. Broad as the range of Czecho-Slovak control was, for the time being, large groups were nevertheless isolated from their comrades in the east by the Bolsheviks and the enemy-prisoner forces concentrated at Tchita and Habarovsk. They had very insufficient supplies of munitions, and no prospect of increasing them, whilst of provisions and clothing for the winter they had none. Their numbers further were limited and subject to* constant attrition through enemy attacks and sheer physical exhaustion. A. stage came when it was evident that the whole movement must be abortive, and their anabasis end in disaster if relief could not be provided.On the 22nd July, the Czech Commander-in-Chief decided, in view of the gravity of the situation, that he must despatch all his forces at Vladivostock westward again, to the relief of his compatriots cut off iii Central Siberia. On the 3rd August the decision was taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government to extend military help to the Czecho-Slovaks. The Czech forces in Eastern Siberia numbered 14,000 at this time of whom half were in the region of Vladivostock and Nikolsk; a further 11,000 were on the Manchurian border, and 3,000 occupied Irkutsk. At every point they were greatly outnumbered, and faced with armament heavier than anything they had them-selves. In the pocket of a German officer captured by Semenov was found a copy of a wireless message of the 7th June, from the General Staff in Berlin, directing that all prisoners should be organised as regular units with pay, promotion, &amp;c, as in Germany for complete co-operation with the Bolsheviks against the Czechs.The results of the Allied intervention were felt very rapidly. The forces under Semenov were enabled to advance, thus relieving the pressure on the Czechs in Trans-Baikalia, who tookVerkhni-Udinsk on the 22nd August, whilst an advance was made towards Habarovsk. By the 4th September railway communication had been, again re-established along the whole Trans-Siberian Railway, and with Habarovsk in Japanese hands, the sole remaining Bolshevik centre of resistance was Blagovest-chensk, which fell on the 19th September. (On the 13th September, General Gaida, who had taken over the command of the Czech forces in place of General Dietrich, issued an order establishing martial law from Olovyannaya to Vladivostock.) The comparative ease with which the Czechs have overcome the Bolshevik resistance tends to lend probability to the supposition that similar resolute intervention on the part of the Allies in European Russia in July 1917 might have been effective in saving that country from the Bolshevik episode.o
