The conveyance of 5,000 tons of coal from America involves the shutting out of 5,000 tons of other stores and (supply tonnage being the limiting factor to the American Military Programme) this involves tho loss of 1,000 American soldiers in France. As against this, 5,000 tons of coal can be produced in a year by 20 men.     Some allowance must, of course, he made for the tonnage required for conveyance of coal from the United Kingdom to Franco, but the advantage of supplying coal from the United Kingdom remains very great.XX xxxl-Yhitohall Gardens, LVi?.lo3rd October, 19180
