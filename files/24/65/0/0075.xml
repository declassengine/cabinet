(1).2nd October,&apos; 1918.Referenct No..----- .Sir,* *&quot;I beg to submit the following report on the work of the Food Production Department for the week ended 1st October, 1918:-.&apos; , The weather *   . In moat districts there.was not more than one fine day last week.  A oertain amount of carrying.was done, though much of the grain carried was in doubtful condition.   In the north and north west counties and in Wales a large- proportion, varying in places from 50 to 85 per cent, of the corn is still out. -&quot;  LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committee. A circular letter has been sent to the Committees urging them to put in hand at once and complete, if possible, within the next two months a careful survey of all holdings over 50 acres for the purpose of (1) classifying the grass land on each holding so as to ascertain which fields are suitable for ploughing, and (2) obtaining particulars of any farms which are not being properly cultivated. &apos; A specimen card showing the particulars to be recorded has been prepared and circulated to the Committees.&apos;   In view of the possibility that some farmers may lay down to grass the land recently ploughed or may increase their area of temporary grass&apos;with the result that the production of, tillage-ord^s for the;harvest of 1919 would be substantially less than it wasthis- year, it has been decided to make a general rcrder under the Defence of the Realm Regulations-requiring,   .....Vevery farmer to maintain for the harvest of 1919 the same area of certain specified tillage crops as he had this year.*.      1      M
the crop! to be specified will include ell the easentlei food1stuffs for man and beast, and the order should have the effect of stimulating the production of a larger quantity of home-grown feeding stuffs.    Exceptions from the provisions ef the order In special cases will be allowed by permits grunted by the Executive Committees,The portion of the Prime Minister&apos;8 speech et Maneheste on the 12th September, which referred to the necessity of encouraging agriculture and ef increasing home production, has be reprinted as a leaflet, and circulated In large numbers to the Agricultural Executive committees.Buckinghamshire.  A satisfactory settlement has been reached with regard to the 20 acres on the Harewood Downs Golf Club, which was ordered to be ploughed by the Committee in accordance with a recommendation made by one of the Technical advisers to the Department.    The Club only ploughed 12 out of the SO acres, and accordingly the Board authorised the Committee to prosecute the trustees ef the Club for their default.    It was suggested, however, that before proceedings were taken the, Trusteea should be given an opportunity of ploughing the remaining 6 acres, and they have new agreed to do ao before 14th October.Oambridgeshlre^,   In March of last year the Executive Committee took possession of a portion of derelict land comprising a $0 acre farm in the Caxton district, most of which during the last 30 or 40 yeara had gone to bush.  K capable resident bailiff was put in charge, and last June when the land was Inspected by an official of the Department) It was reported that a considerable improvement had been effected.  She Committee have now been    j authorised to take possession of a further portion of derelict land In the same district, comprising a farm of 362 acres and a part of another 142 acre farm.    It is hoped that this land also will make an important contribution to the food supply. i2 -
214Cornwall.   The Committee took possession last April of part of a neglected farn at Pelynt as they did not wish to deprive the owner of the whole of his holding.   He has, however, continued to neglect the remainder of the farm, and the Committee have now been authorised to enter and take possession of the whole and to make arrangements for letting HiWarwickshire.   The owner of a derelict building plot was served with a cultivation order in May last, but though the Committee have offered to assist him with labour he has made no effort to comply with the order.   The Committee have- accordingly been authorised to take possession and to make arrangements for the cultivation of the land.Drainage of Land.   There has been a breach in the bank of the River Aire at Chapel Haddlesey, south-of Selby in the West Riding of Yorkshire, which has caused the flooding of. some 20,000 acres of agricultural land to a depth of several feet.   The area affected is an important potato growing district, and: it is estimated that at least 1,000 acres of potatoes were covered with water, and in addition serious damage has been done to other crops, and a considerable quantity of corn washed away.   The water has now fallen somewhat, and it Is hoped that the work of repairing the breach will shortly be possible.   The Department are endeavouring to obtain the services of 100 German prisoners for the work, and at the Depart-ment&apos;s request the Ministry of Food have issued a general licence authorising the sale of King Edward potatoes on the area affected. The question whether any compensation should be paid to the occupiers of the land out of public funds is under consideration. Prosecutions.   A farmer at Elwich in Durham has been fined  20 and 10 guineas costs for failure to comply with an order to cultivate. In Cornwall a fine of  15 and  10 costs has been inflicted on a farmer who failed to carry out a cultivation order, and for a similar offence a farmer in Buckinghamshire has been fined  10 and  3.3s. costs. Two farmers in Somerset have been fined respectively- 6 -
 15 and  3.3s. costs and  20 and  3.3s. costs for failing to carry out cultivation orders served upon them. Determination of Tenancies,   During the week 2 orders have been made by the Board determining tenancies on account.of bad farming in respect of 292 acres.H&quot;QRTICULTURA3u DIVISION. Provision of Land for Allotments.   Returns.of areas under allotments show that 18% (261.000 of the estimated total of 1,400,000 allotments) are located in the 82 county boroughs. Leicester has the largest area - 1,539 acres. Fruit Section.   Inspections have been carried out in a number o; fruit producing districts, showing that in some of them. .* diseases and pests are prevalent, and that generally pruning am cultivation leave room for improvement.   The Inspectors are carrying on propaganda with the object of improving the standari of cultivation, as a result of which a considerable demand has been made for the recently issued leaflets on American Goaseben Mildew, and Silver Leaf in Plums,   Publicity has been given by I means of press notices to the importance of dealing with these! diseases.   A new leaflet on the Storage of Apples and Pears has! been Issued. IMarketing Section. The marketing organisation is now complete I 23 counties. !At a recent sale upwards of 500 lots of produce were I offered. The prices obtained were satisfactory, and it Is not! worthy that but for the existence of this market three-quartersl the quantity of fruit and vegetables offered would&apos; not have beJ marketed. H4-
215\&amp; the result of applications made to the Fropellant Branch of the Ministry of Munitions, acetic acid for the purpose of pickling cabbage has been liberated to certain growers, with the result that some 36 tons of cabbage have been saved. Live Stock Section,     The Department, in consultation with the Poultry Advisory Committee, has been engaged in providing data for the fixing of egg prices for the winter months.    The data show a very serious deterioration in the quality of such feeding stuffs as are available for use by poultry keepers.TECHNICAL DIVISION. potato growing in Lincolnshire.   Visits have been made to twelve selected potato growing farms representing different soils in Lincolnshire, and data collected as to crop yields, etc     Weighings of Pleasured plots were made. &apos; In connection with this enquiry useful information&apos;was obtained as to the methods adopted by potato growers in the county.     One of the most noteworthy features of the general practice was that exceptionally heavy dressings of artificial manures&apos;are applied;   in some cases these are clearly excessive. &quot; A general opinion held by growers in this district is that once-grown &quot;seed&quot; from Scotland is superior to new Scotch &quot;seed&quot; as regards the production of &quot;ware&apos;&apos;, and the weighings made seem to support this contention.    As regards disease, among the better-cropping varieties, &quot;President&quot; was conspicuous as a disease-resister.    Traces of disease were found in &quot;King Edward&quot; and &quot;Arran Chief.&quot;,, in both sprayed and unsprayed crops.     In general, early-planted potatoes seemed to have died down prematurely, whereas crops planted later, even as late as June, promised to give somewhat better yields.Utilisation of badly-damaged Crain Crops. consideration is being rriven to this question, and practical tests of certain suggestions that have been put forward are in progress.; It is hoped that it may be possible in the course of a few days to formulate advice on the subject, which is causing serious concern.in some parts of the country.
LABOUR DIVISION. Harvest Labour.   The number of soldiers now out on two monthsagricultural furlough for harvest work is 6,471.Ploughmen for Autumn Cultivation,   The shortage- of skilledploughmen Is beginning to be seriously felt now- that farmers andesirous of pushing on with their autumn work.   Although thereare many more soldiers and prisoners on the land than at thistime last year, the number of skilled ploughmen has de^reee-edowing to the calling up since the spring of 22,-000 experienced!the majority of whom vrere ploughmen.   The position will be evenworse if the 7,000 to 8,000 soldiers recently graded &quot;A&quot; cannotbe allowed to remain, as the majority of these men are ploughmerand have been with their present employers for many months andcannot be replaced by equally efficient men.   The services ofadditional ploughmen are urgently necessary, and the Ministry ofNational Service are urging the War Office to grant furlough tolimited number of men for ploughing work. .Prisoners of War.   A soheme has been prepared and submitted tothe War Office with the object of utilising prisoner labour, botlskilled and unskilled, on threshing work.   If a large area ofarable land is to be ploughed and sown, it is essential that thefarmers1 ordinary employees should not be taken from ploughingwork to assist with threshing on the arrival of the machines.avoid this, it is proposed as far as possible to attach to eachmachine a migratory gang of prisoners which can he moved fromplace- to place with the machine, the scheme being similar to thaadopted for the better utilisation of prisoner labour duringharvest.,   Under such a scheme, advantage can be taken of theservices of those prisoners who are engine drivers and feedersto man some of the threshing machines, now idle for want of       ^skilled men.    Under existing War Office regulations for theemployment of prisoners of war in agriculture,, the servioes of tskilled men cannot be utilised on threshing.
216Some of the migratory pengs of prisoners have new returned to camp on completion of the com harvest, the remainder beinp retained for the potato harvest.Women1s Branch,Supply of Labour.   The supply of women is still inadequate to the demand, and it is probable that a shortage will continue until the end of November.    Secondary schools are being asked if girls can be released to (50 daily to work in the fields. Training.    Training centres in Essex and Cambridge have beento.....x.iiii.iiiimh&quot;4(wvisited during the week by one of the officers of the Branch, who reports that excellent progress is beinjr made by the women under instruction.Welfare.   A certain number of Welfare Officers are being trained at Burghley In Korthamptonshire.    They are being ,?iven an Insight into general farm work in order that they may more thoroughly understand the conditions under which members of the Land Army work,The Y.W.C.A. are showing keen interest in the Land Army, and have formed a Land Committee especially to organise ways and means in which to help.    A list of their officers is being supplied to the Department, and any Land Army Welfare Officers who retire assistance financially or otherwise in the formation of club rooms, rest rooms, recreation rooms, concerts and enter-talnments can apply to the area controller in their particular district.CULTIVATION DIVISION.- -mini,aim,mi now.....mm.......Tractor scheme.

Several foals have recently been sold by the Etep&amp;i ment.   The West Riding Committee sold seven foals,by auction last week which realised an average of 30^.guineas, one realising 43 guineas.   At the same time the auctioneers-gave prizes for the stj in the ring, and one first, one second and two third prizes were obtained by the Department^ stock amounting to  5. Steam Tackle.   The acreage dealt with during the past week is as follows:-   ploughed 9,0$6-cultivated 23,649, harrowed 928, mole-drained 624.   Total 34,257 acres.Harvest Work.   21 threshing machines were supplied to Agricultur Executive Committees during the week ended 28th September.   The total number supplied to counties to date is 348.   31 straw truss have been supplied. ,  ,During the week ended ,13th September,&apos; 1,835 daysf work was done by binders working //1th tractors; the total accomplish since the 26th July represents 24,835 days/ work;&apos;Supplies Division. Sulphate of Ammonia.   Amended and increased demands of the French Government for ammonia liquor, which have been accepted by the Explosives Department of the Ministry.-of- Munitions, have involved a reconsideration of licences issued for sulphate of ammonia for agriculture during the period SeptemberNovember, and somereduction of the quantities licenced will be necessary.&quot;.......&quot; &apos; &apos;Superphosphate. Steps are being, taken to impressiipon agricultur: merchants the importance of farmers taking early delivery of superphosphate and compound fertilisers. Only in this way will i be possible to avoid railway congestion in the spring, and to secure a maximum output by makers.Potash.   Supplies from the British Potash Company are now being offered to approved fertiliser agents and compound fertiliser manufacturers in England and Wales,
217Export of Seeds.   The Seeds Advisory Committee recommend that, in view of the larger areas of seed crops grown under contract during the past season and the good results of the 1918 harvest, a somewhat larger quantity of seeds might now be allowed to be exported under licence to British possessions and the Allies than was permitted last season.It is rather too early to make any definite statements as to beet, carrots, onions or dwarf and runner beans, but the outlook for these late harvested seeds is very promising.   Broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, parsnip, turnip, kohl rabi, rape and broad beans are exceedingly good, and in some cases record crops of seed have been harvested.   Mangel, swede, spinach, kale and brussels sprouts are &amp;oodj   peas, particularly the dwarf varieties, have suffered from bad weather and are likely to be rather short, and the only seeds which look like being very short are celery, leek, radish and endive.Seed Wheat.   The demand for the wheats selected for distribution by the Department is keen, and stocks are being passed as rapidly as possible into the distributing agents&apos; hands.Wart Disease.-   Legal proceedings have-Jbeen instituted In eight cases against occupiers of premises in the South Wales infected area, who planted susceptible varieties of potatoes in contravention of the Wart Disease of Potatoes (Restricted Districts) Order of 1917, Ncl. Convictions were obtained, and fines inflicted in seven Instances. These convictions will have a .useful effect in the above area, though, apart from certain districts, the order appears to have been well observed.Spraying.   During the past week some of the Important potato-growing areas, Including Cornwall, North Fales, Lancashire, Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire have been visited with a view to ascertaining the amount of blight in the crop at the present time.   Generally speaking, the situation in this respect is better than at the same- 9 -
time last year and there ia less blight in the tubers than mlghl have been expected from the appearance of the haulm. Disease ii more extensive in the tubers in North West Wales than in other parts visited, but even in this district it is estimated that ci an average not more than five per cent of the tubers are blight) at present.I am,-Sir,Your obedient Servant, IThe Rt. Hon. Rowland K. rrothero,President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
