THE LlUJgJ OF NATIONS.Homo, by Mr. G,.if.Barnes.y . &quot; &quot;i ,i &apos; i*i i   if   in&quot; mi. i,     i.imi*There      a sentence in tin.)  y] dress of Mr, Aaquith at Manchester with which I -am in-&quot;cordial ^greoraofft,. namely that&apos; in which ho pleads for allied understanding in regard to the practical aspect of the League of Nation&apos;.;,:;       Up to now ouch a&apos;league has beer/talked about &quot;only&apos; in rhetorical terms and I am afraid, if we donjt advance beyond that stage, when peace comes it will be lost sight of alto--get her, and the nations will begin again in the old bad -waytxf. preparing against one another..for other wars.     I have ex-pressed that&apos; opinion many a time, publicly and privately. . I find lir. Asquith yesterday says that &quot;The time has come when the best heads. among the Allies who - can be spared.from com--batant and administrative work might be assembled in confer-ence to attack the practical side of the problem, upon the solution of which the future of mankind depends&quot;.An Allied understanding, however? must be preceded by discussion on the part of each of the Allies, and some&apos;de-gree of clearness reached as to the views of each of the Allies, I would therefore suggest that the Cabinet discuss soon the: report of the Phillimore Committee.and the French proposals with a view to coming to a conclusion as to tho.basis of dis-r cussion between the Allies at such a&apos;conference as Hr,-Asquith. suggests.   The speech of the German Chancellor&apos; the other day is. an indication of how the wind is blowing there. The Germans are going to - exploit - the idea of a League - of-&apos; Nations,,   Of course, we know that it.will be humbug,   But why leave the field to be exploited?   I think we should try. to come to an. understanding with the Allies as to what is. meant by a League of Nations, and then. formulate the results of that understanding,,   I believe it might have an important bearing on the minds of the German people if, as I assume to be the case, the plam admitted of.,a democratic Germany, being&apos; admitted to a League of Nations, provided she were willing-; to give the necessary guarantees,;(Initialled) G,I)&apos;,B...2, Whitehall Gardens,&apos; St,\7,l, 28th, September, 1913,     &apos;. &apos;
