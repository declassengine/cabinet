Meeting of Council.The Council met on August 29-30th (minutes separately circulated). The action taken in execution of its decisions is included in the report.I. Italian Coal*The programme for the supply of coal to Italy continues at 600,000 tons a month, and the figures for August 15th to September 14th are as follows : ---	Plan.	Execution.British coal passing Italian frontier    ....... French coal on board at Mediterranean ports.....	Tons. 150,000 100,000   . j    350,000 j	Tons. 295,804 97,932 104,578 105,000	600,000	603,314Attention is called to the fact that whereas 136,000 tons of British coal have been shipped to Blaye for Italy, only 98,000 have been railed across the frontier.II. French Goal.The shipments during August amounted to 1,394,140 tons against the provisional programme of 1,740,000 tons, a deficit of 245,860 tons. Since the last report the coal available for shipment in this country has become rather more plentiful and shipments are accordingly increasing.III. Belgian Belief.During the period covered by the report the main action has been taken in relation to a deficit of some 30,000 tons in prospective September arrivals for Belgian Belief caused by a strike of dockers at Rotterdam, which stopped work at that port for the greater part of August. This deficit has been met by the combined efforts of the United States and Great Britain, and the tonnage arranged for the Belgian Relief during the months of September, October,, and November should be sufficient to meet the stated requirements. The successful working of this programme depends of course on the efficient working of the available tonnage, and steps are being taken to watch closely the movements of the Belgian Relief tonnage, with a view to seeing that there is no avoidable delay either at Rotterdam or in the United States, and that the average length of the round voyage is kept within the limit of 65 days. On this basis the requirements of the Belgian Relief should be met.IV. Special Allocations among Allies.(a) During August 313,000 American soldiers were embarked, of which 103,985 were carried in American and French tonnage, 198,589 in British, and 10,426 in Italian.(b) British Liner Services from the United States to France. British Tonnage-loading on this service in September amounts to 102,200 tons deadweight, and in October it will amount approximately to another 102,000 tons deadweight.(c) British Liner Services from the United States to Italy show a loading for September of 62,895 tons deadweight, the allocations for October amount to about 45,314 tons deadweight.(d) In August 244,000 tons have been diverted to France and 105.000 tons to Italy.V. Pool Tonnage.The operation of vessels under the direction of the Council in the Neutral Pool continues on the same lines, and a total deadweight tonnage of 453,856 out of an ultimate total of about 750,000 tons deadweight has now come under the scheme.VI. (a)-Other Tonnage Arrangements-Use of Sailing Tonnage.A scheme has been considered for the most advantageous use of the sailing vessels which have hitherto been employed in carrying wheat from Australia to the North Pacific coast of America, the necessity for this employment having disappeared.* The &quot;previous report of action contained certain approximate figures. In the light of exact figures subsequently ascertained, the figure for the execution of the plan for the period July 15th August 14th is 628,731, as against the approximate figure 630,965 ; the figure for the deficit is 44,947 as against the figure 42,670.   The deficit carried forward to the period September 15th-r-October 14th is 41,633.
It has been unanimously decided that in consequence of the, seriousness of the coal position in South America (Plate and West Coast), and also at Sierra, Leone and Dakar, the following scheme provided the best employment for the vessels :--,(1) A triangular run from the States to Australia (with oil and general cargo), from Australia to the West Coast of South America with coal, and from&apos; thence to the States with nitrate. ^  -       ! ;(2) A triangular route from the States, from the U.S.A. to South Africa (if- from the Gulf with oil-otherwise with general cargo), from Durban to Dakar or Sierra Leone with coal, and from the West Coast of Africa to the States with mahogany or other West African produce.(3) A fleet of sailing vessels to carry coal from South Africa to the Plate, returning in ballast. . vIt is stated that the exportable surplus of coal from Durban amounts to about 100,000 tons a month.(b) Congestion at Port Said.The extremely unsatisfactory condition of Port Said owing to the considerable congestion of French transhipment cargo there (about 70,000 tons) has been under consideration.The following measures have been taken by the French Government: (1) No more shipments are to be made from the Far East to Port Said, the French Pacific liners returning to Marseilles instead of returning from Port Said to the East. :(2) Available French vessels in the Mediterranean are being sent there to clear the local stores, and the Ministry of Shipping has allocated a 8,000-ton vessel, with the possibility of sending another.(3) The local situation as regards labour and appliances will be improved.(c)-Shipm,ent of Cars from U.K. to France.(a) A considerable amount of American tonnage employed on American Army requirements in France being held up for want of coal, it was decided that in order to avoid waste of shipping, some of these vessels should load the railway wagons being allocated by this country to France, and arrangements were made for this to be done.(b) A total of 2,665 wagons have, inclusive of those carried by the above arrangements, being lifted up to date. In addition 654 have been carried by the train ferry service in the period August 10th September 12th. The total shipped, therefore, is 3,319. &apos;&apos;(d) Franco-Brazilian Agreement Employment of ex-Enemy Vessels.Following the proposals put forward by the United States Government for the co-operative use of the 30 ex-German vessels covered by the&apos; Franco-Brazilian Agreement, the French Government has agreed in general to the proposals made:by the American Government with the following counter-proposals :- ,1. Out of the 30 vessels forming part of the, Franco-Brazilian Agreement of December 1917, three would be employed in the traffic Brazil/France, in order to satisfy the French Government needs in Brazilian merchandise. . -2. In order to make the 32 voyages mentioned in Article 15 of the Franco-Brazilian Agreement, eight vessels will have to be maintained permanently in the traffic from Brazilian ports, but France would be prepared in conjunction with the United States to request the Brazilian Government to allow the cargoes to be loaded in Brazil to be shipped to the United States instead of to Europe. Should this be acceptable to the Brazilian Government, eight vessels would be put in the triangular , route Brazil/U.S.A./France, France/Cardiff in ballast, Cardiif/Brazil with coal W       for Brazil.   . - &apos;     ! K.   The American Government would put a certain number of vessels in this same triangular route, the quantity of which would be so calculated,as to compensate France for the loss of tonnage through extra. delay for the trip Brazil/U.S.A. plus time for . loading and unloading. ...   I       ,     ,.   A 2 &apos;
i 3. Nineteen vessels remain, of which some have not yet been delivered. The French Government cannot undertake to put these vessels on the above-mentioned triangular route permanently, but would be prepared to put them on this traffic temporarily as and when delivered with the same compensating tonnage to be furnished by the United States.It would be understood that these vessels could be withdrawn from this traffic by the French Government, and in this case the tonnage furnished by the United States would be reduced in proportion to the Brazilian ships withdrawn.In answer to this counter-proposal the American Government has stated that at the present time they are not in a position to give the French Government replace-ment tonnage in compensation for loss of time through the diversion on the round voyage, and the French Government has agreed not to claim the replacement for the time being with the understanding that the United States will, as soon as they are able to do so, put some tonnage at the disposal of France in order to offset the above-mentioned delays.APPENDICES.(a) Letter from the Transport Council to the Lord Council.(b) Do. do.(c) Letter from the Food Council to the Transport Council.(d) Letter to Japanese Ambassador.(e) Provisional Statement of Allied and Neutral Tonnage for August 1918.(a) Letter from Transport Council to Food Council. Sir, 4th September 1918.I have to inform you that I laid before the Allied Maritime Transport Council your letter of the 19th ultimo enclosing a general Food Programme for the three European Allies for the cereal year 1918-19, together with the explanatory memo-randum by the&apos; Committee of Representatives and the further Memorandum with regard to distribution as between the Allies.After considerable discussion at which the Chairman of the Committee of Representatives was present, the Council decided that it was not possible for them to&apos;come, to a final conclusion as to the total importation of foodstuffs in the new cereal year&apos;for which they would be justified in endeavouring to arrange tonnage in view of the incompleteness of the information as to (a) this year&apos;s harvests, and (6) some of the main competing requirements for tonnage, in particular the American Army Supply Programme and the Munitions Programmes of the three European Allies.In these circumstances they decided to recommend to the respective Govern-ments that the programme should be commenced provisionally and on the basis of the quantities covered by the priority figures, it being fully understood that the figures would be reconsidered as soon as full information is available.With regard to military oats, they decided to recommend that the old programme of importation should continue until the matter has been further considered.The Transport Council expressed the.hope that the Food Council will find it practicable to arrange for the inclusion at the earliest possible date of the American Food Import Programme in the general programme on the same basis as the others.In.view of the fact that in present circumstances the provisional acceptance of the priority system as a basis for the allocation of ships must, in fact, involve the diversion of British ships to supplement deficient importations into France and Italy, . the British representatives on the Council assented to the above recommendation on the understanding that (a) the arrangement must be regarded as voluntary and subject to cancellation; (b) that a satisfactory agreement is arrived as between the different Allies as to their putting a. specified quantity of tonnage into the Food Programme and/or carrying defined quantities of food in their own ships; and (c) that the continuance of the arrangements will necessarily be subject to the inclusion of America on equal terms at an early date.: The Transport Council also had under their consideration the administrative arrangements to be made to give effect to the above policy.   They- recognise.that their
(b) Letter of Transport Council to Food Council.Sir, 6th September 1918.With reference to my letter of yesterday&apos;s date respecting the Food CounciFs Programme for the cereal year 1918-19 and the decisions of the Allied Maritime Transport Council with regard to the provision of tonnage, I have to inform you that, on the best estimate that is at present practicable, the total arrivals of foodstuffs in the three European Allied countries during the four months September to December .1918 inclusive (having regard to the Transport Council&apos;s decision and to the present disposition of tonnage) are likely to amount to about 63 million tons, excluding Military oats, or. 7 million tons including Military oats.Tarn to observe that, apart from the ordinary factors of uncertainty to which any estimate of future importations is necessarily subject, any estimate made at this moment is liable to be affected by the important discussions expected to take place during the next month with regard to the American Military Supply Programme.I I am to suggest, however, that in the meantime you should arrange for the preparation of an export programme based upon the probable arrivals in the. three European Allied countries during the four months in question on the basis of the above estimate, and showing countries of origin and quantities of each commodity.J. A. Salter.(c) Letter of Food Council to Transport Council.Sir, 13th. September 1918.I am directed by the Committee of Representatives to acknowledge receipt of your letters of the 4th and 6th instant with reference to the Programme of Food Importation for the Cereal Year 1918-19.With regard to the former letter the Committee of Representatives have given careful consideration to the matter, and they desire me; to convey to the Allied Maritime Transport Council their observations on the recommendations and proposals therein contained.They have noted the recommendation : &quot;That the programme should &quot;be commenced provisionally and on the basis of the quantities covered by the priority figures,&quot;,and they accept, it on the understanding that the figures are subject to review at any . time on the motion of any country as circumstances may render this necessary.   Itmay be mentioned that some members of the Committee consider that an increase mthe figures will shortly be required. .  The Committe entirely concur in the suggestion of the Transport Council thatthe demand for tonnage should be dealt with by a Freight Committee on lines similar.13own organisation must necessarily depend to some extent upon the organisation adopted by the Food Council.If the Food Council arranges for the machinery to follow generally the lines already adopted for cereals, the Transport Council presume that the demands, for tonnage for all foodstuffs will be centralised through,a Freight Committee of the Food Representatives Committee. In. that event the Council would, arrange that their own Tonnage Committee would be primarily responsible for making the arrangements indicated in (6) of the preceding paragraph, and they would endeavour to arrange that the Committee should include executive officers with authority on behalf of the respective Governments to give or reserve assent to a proposed diversion of national tonnage and to make consequent arrangements with, the Freight Committee. They would contemplate that, the above arrangements being made, the Shipping Depart-ment of the Food Organisation would deal on executive questions of detail with the actual shipping authorities of the four countries resident in London as to the execution of their several parts of the common plan.I should be glad to be informed whether these administrative proposals are convenient from the point of your organisation.(Signed)     J. A. Salter.
to&apos; those now adopted&apos;for cereals. The Committee of Representatives had already; decided to set up a general Freight Committee which will deal with, questions of freight in connection with all food imports; and it is desired that this Committee shall work in close co-operation with the Tonnage Committee established by the Allied: Maritime Transport Council. It is understood that the Council are willing that they; should be represented at meetings of the Freight Committee. The Committee of&apos; Representatives observe the proposal of the Allied Maritime Transport Council for securing that: each country should undertake a specified share in carrying food.. The Committee have noted the statements in your letter of the 6th instant as to the. limitation of imports during the four months September to December 1918 inclusive, and will defer commenting on them until they have had an opportunity, of further considering the matter. They are communicating with the military authorities on the question of the limitation of the import of military oats during those.months, but although it is possible that by some unifying of the oats rations in the Allied Armies a reduction in the requirement may be effected, the Committee feel that the proposed figure, of 750,000 tons will be insufficient.   -J. F. BeALE.   ;-(d) Letter to Japanese Ambassador.Your Excellency, , 7   . . - .... 10th September 1918.I hav^e the honour to inform you that, at their recent session in London, the Allied Maritime Transport Council decided unanimously to send an invitation to the Japanese Government to be represented on the Council. &quot;I enclose herewith, for your information, a copy of a short memorandum adopted by the Council at the first meeting as a correct description of their objects and proposed methods of work, and I shall be happy to furnish any further information on the subject that may be desired.The Council at present consists of two Ministers each of France, Italy, and Great Britain, and two delegates from the United States of America. It meets in any of the three capitals of the European Allies that may be convenient, and it has a permanent organisation situated in London.The Council has no executive power to allocate tonnage, but is advisory to the several Governments. It endeavours to ascertain the manner in which tonnage may best be utilised in. the common interest, seeking to eliminate services not essential to the war, and to secure more complete Allied co-operation in the use of available tonnage.In order that the Council may make recommendations to the Allied Governments with&apos; a full knowledge of the facts, Allied Programme Committees have been created whose function is to ascertain the import needs of, and make an import programme lor, each Ally. It is hoped that it will thus,be possible, by a joint Allied examination having regard to the common interest, both, to ascertain the total import requirements of all the Allied countries and then to adjust them.to the carrying capacity of the total available tonnage. -&apos; &apos;*;At - the time when the Council was formed, each of the four countries now represented on it had already requisitioned its own tonnage, and had itself made arrangements for the allocation of that tonnage as between its military and civilian requirements and the needs of any of the other Allies.;;3v,&apos;It was clear, however, that if opportunities of economising tonnage were not to be lost, the Allied tonnage and supply position required examination by the Allies as ,a.whole and.not merely by each of them separately, and it was for this purpose that the Council was formed. At the same time the system of control already put in force by each of the four Allies in question over its own tonnage greatly facilitated the practical execution of any common, plan for the re-allocation of tonnage on which the &quot;Allies might agree.As it is a part of the constitution of the Council that each country retains, the executive control over its own tonnage, it follows that recommendations of thb Council which affect the allocation of ships belonging to a particular Ally are conditional upon the assent of that Ally. The&quot; experiencebf the Council has shown, however, that in spite of this reservation rit is practicable; to- make arrangements -by&apos; agreement which do secure a better and . more economical distribution and allocation of tonnage.     ;       - - -    ; :;v; -    ; -: ..... &apos;;
Tho Council would! be glad to [be informed whether the Japanese Government decide to accept the I invitation hereby conveyed to them,! Robert CecilMemorandum enclosed in letter to Japanese Ambassador.The purpose of the Allied Maritime Transport Council is to watch over Ijhe general conduct of Allied transport; and, while leaving each nation responsible for the management and supervision of the tonnage under iits own control, to secure the necessary exchange of information and co-ordination in policy and effort: on the part of the four Governments of France, Italy,&apos;the United , States of America, and Gr6at Britain in adjusting their programmes of imports to hhe carrying capacity1 of the available tonnage (having regard to naval and military requirements), and in making the most advantageous allocation and disposition of the tonnage under their Control in accordance with the urgency of war needs.For this purpose the Council: will obtain through its permanent staff the programmes of important requirements drawn up by the Inter-Allied Programme Committees which are established or to be established on the model of the;Wheat Executive. (with such modifications, as inay be necessary in the different; cases) for each of the main classes of essential imports, and take these as the basis; It will also be responsible for obtaining through its permanent staff the fullest I information as to the tonnage available to the respective Governments, for examining the imports programmes furnished by tho Programme Committees in relation to the carrying power of the available tonnage, for, ascertaining the extent of any deficit, and for considering the means; whereby such a deficit may Ue met, whether by a further reduction in the programmes of imports or by the acquisition, if practicable, j of further tonnage for importing work.. If the Council agrees that reductions in any! of the different programmes of imports to a defined extent are necessary, the Ministers will so report to itheir respective Governments with a view to secure that the necessary decisions and action are taken in their respective countries, and the necessary modifications are made in the programmes produced by the several Inter-Allied Programme Committees. .............................(e\ Provisional Statement of Allied and Neutral Tonnage for August 191 j.General Notes. i iThis is the second of a series of provisional tonnage statements which! will be issued about I the&apos; 15th of each month, followed by a revision a month,later. &apos;]   jSubject to such revision, the tables shown are believed to. be reasonably complete for tonnage of the four principal Allies, except as noted, and for losses by enemy action for all countries. In other respects the figures are based upon a considerable body of information, and are fairly complete, except for small vessels.   Table L, showing employment of tonnage, is; subject to most reservations/Under &quot; Other Allies&quot; are included Japan, Russia, Brazil, Greece, Portugal, and Belgiurii. Under &quot; Neutrals &quot; are included Norway; Holland, Sweden, Spain,&apos; and Denmark. Available; data ior lesser maritime nations are at present too incomplete for inclusion. The aggregate tonnage thus excluded is perhaps 500,000 tons, most of it employed in the service of neutrals.; jDeadweight figures for Italian, French, British, and American vessels are based largely upon records for individual vessels.   For tonnage of &quot;Other Allies&quot; and &quot; Neutrals&apos;.&apos; deadweight records1, are at present incomplete, and the figures presented are gross plus 50 per cent,   The same riitio! has been used elsewhere for individual vessels on which deadweight figures were unobtainable, except where another ratio was suggested by known facts.                ! i&apos;!&apos; .   ......&apos;&quot;&apos;   . ., ________....................,___________.^udi______.....A..4;.      v

Notes ok Table I..   The provisional nature of this table is to be emphasized.   Due to the difficulty of obtaining informa-d tion promptly, the figures given in this table for Italy, &quot; Other Allies,&quot; and &quot; Neutrals&quot; are substantially the revised figures as of 31st July.   This does not materially lessen the significance of the distribution of the tonnage among the various services,&apos;but it does affect several totals.   For the United States the figures m marked (*) are estimated in the absence of reported figures.g American figures do not include certain vessels in coasting service and certain vessels of merchant type built or converted for and owned by the Navy, of whose movements the U.S. Shipping Board does not keep itself informed. A similar qualification as to vessels in naval service applies in the case of the other principal Allies, although probably in lesser degree.Jmport Service. The tonnage shown as in the import service of a country or countries is in general that which at the time is carrying cargo to that country or going out largely or wholly in ballast toA reasonable division of tonnage serving several countries has beenobtain cargo for such countries, made.Of about 1,000,000 tons of British liners in the North Atlantic approximately 40 per cent, of the cargo space proves to be sacrificed to the carriage of troops. Accordingly, 60 per cent, of this tonnage is accounted in the &quot; Import Service of the United Kingdom&quot; and 40 per cent, in &quot; Other Military and Naval Service.&quot;Coasting Service.
