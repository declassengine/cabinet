In August 1913 imports of grain and flour were down 40^ as against August 1917.    This large fall was, however, due to the exceptional efforts to reconstitute our grain stores in the summer of last year.    As compared with 1916 the fall amountou to very much less.   Meat imports as against August 1917 were up some ZTfo,    Iron ore was up 26$ Imports of timber were very small compared with August 1917, the reduction being 63$ for the 8 months ended August however there was no decline, as this, year the import hasteen more evenly spread.   Jfcw wool was down 4$&amp; on the month and 38$ on the eight months,    Baw cotton was down Z% on the month, but up 2$ on the eight months.    It is important U note, that the figures for mineral oils include the very heavy imports if Admiralty fuel oil.Total exports in August amounted to 4,024.000 tons, which is 13/* below the figure for JteSst 1917.    Goal exports amounted to 3,611*000 tons, or 13$ more than in August 1917.   Most important manufactures show a reduction in tonnage on August 1917 - iron and steel cf 24$ cotton manufactures oi 42$, wooi manufactures of 3C$ and 1 other textiles1 &amp;t 65$,While imports in August were down 321 on 1913 the entrances of British and Foreign vessels (with cargo) were down 51%j  and while imports were down 4%on 1917 torbage entrances were up 4J .  Thus, afc against 1913 the loading factor is 39$ greater and as against 1917In August British entrances with carp amounted to 1,825,000   , net tons, that is 9% more than in August 1917.   British clearances were le272^000 - 22)( less than in August 1917.   Foreign entrances amounted to 268.000 tons, Z2% lesg than in August 1917 - and foreign clearances to 680,000 tons, 24$       than in August 1917.In August total losses of British shipping, of over 500 G.T. amounted to 195,000 rross tons of which 145.000 tons were due to MB risk, as against a total loss in July of 188.000 tons.    British built vessels brought into service amounted to 137,000 tons, and total gains, including purchases and requisitioned vessels, to 140,000 tons.t War losses of the Allies (other tf&amp;an British) i. Augustwere 89,000 tons as against 71.000 tons in July, and of neutrals 40^000 tons as against 25.000 tons in July and 39.000 tons 5jq June* The average of world war losses to Britisn, Allied and Neutrals combined over the first eight months of 1918 amount to about 290,000 tons a month.On July 31st - the figure for August 31st is not vet available as compared with June 30th.   the oir lament of the British ^roantil* steam fleet orer 500 tons, h^u cLoi^od as follows;-

In consequence however, of statistical uncertainties due to changes in the method of classification, no great stress can be laid on this figure.10.
