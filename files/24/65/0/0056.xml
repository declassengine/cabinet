(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.      f WAR CABINET.G.T.5856. COMMITTEE OF HOME AFFAIRSMINISTRY OF HEALTH BILL.(Copy of letter to the Prime Minister from the Joint Committee of Approved Societies).112 CITY ROAD,The Rt.Hon. E.C1.D.Lloyd George, M.P.10 Downing Street, Oct. 1st, 1918S.W.I.Sir ,On behalf of the Joint Committee of Approved Societies which is constituted of the following bodies, viz:National Conference of Friendly Societies, General Federation of Trade Unions, National Association of Deposit Societies, National Federation of Dividing Societies, National Union of Holloway Friendly Societies, Association of Works1 Health Societies,, Association of Catholic Societies, Co-operative Wholesale Society, and others,I beg to inform you that, having had explained to them by the Minister of Reconstruction the terms of the Draft Bill for the establishment of a Ministry of Health, the Executive of the National Conference of Friendly Societies^in pursuance of a resolution passed at their recent delegate Conference at Leicester-have informed Dr.Addison that it will be necessary for them to strongly oppose the Bill in Its present form, inasmuch as it pro-poses to incorporate In the new Ministry the administration of the whole of the Poor Law as at present existing, without any pro-vision for the future dissociation from the new Ministry of the non-medical side of the Poor Law.*In the view of the Friendly Societies, Trade Unions, and other bodies comprising the Joint Committee of Approved Societies, a Bill on these lines would not only prove unacceptable to the general public, but would result in tainting the thrift and health insurance work carried on by the Societies, which work is also to be associated with the new Ministry.I venture.to remind you thaU/fhe Friendly Societies waited upon you in the Autumn of 1917, the objection of all fchtatftf i    present to any association of the desired Ministry with the Poor Law was forcibly demonstrated, and you then intlm-ated that unless there was agreement between all concerned, a Bill in war time was not possible..We are aware that Dr.Addison was afterwards authorised by you to endeavour to effect an agreement, and that he to an extent succeeded, as is evidenced by his public stave-ment, in the early part of the present year, that he had arrived at an understanding with those with whom he had been negotiating -That
That understanding has, however, been departed from in more than one respect by the Home Affairs Committee, to whom the Bill was subsequently referred, and particularly so as regard? the Poor Law.   As a consequence, those connected with Health Insurance with whom Dr-Addiscn had arrived at an understanding, recently informed him by letter, that as that understanding had since been departed from by the Home. Affairs Committee^ they were no longer bound by the so-called agreement *In these circumstances, my Committee trust that the War Cabinet will not permit the Bill to be introduced into the House of Commons until the question of the Poor Law has been further considered.   As, however, statements have been made pub-licly that the introduction of the Bill will follow the re-assem-bling of Parliament, my Committee feel that they must take all possible steps to arouse both publio and parliamentary opinion to the danger of repeating the mistakes of 184;   And 1871 by assoc-     L iating the non-medical side of Poor Law with Health legislation.I am, Sir,Your obedient servant,(Sd,)   P. ROCKLIFF.Seoretary.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W., 2nd October, 1918,1
