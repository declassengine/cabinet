Want of experience in organisation of Supplies and. the direction of an offensive also appears to have added to the difficulties of the Americans.So far the number of prisoners taken by the Americans is reported, to be over 8,000 and the.guns taken over 120,Of the 26 trained Divisions under General Pershing, on 2nd. October 2 were with the French Armies, one being engaged in Battle and the other in reserve.     The remaining 24 Divisions were under the orders of the First American Army,,(b).
