On October 12th, 1916, Kr. Lloyd Goorge then Socretary of State for War, gave the following answer in the House of Commons in reply to represent at ions nade by Sir George Greenwood, Colonel Hark Lockwood vuow Lord Lambourno). and others, as to the cruelty of selling oast horses to be maltreated by Eastern peoples:-&quot;iiH, LLOYD GEORGE:   Although after making enquiries we have no reason to believe that the horses are badly treated there, I will premiss, as far as Franco is concerned; to consider the matter further^   As far as the East is concerned, the Right Hon, Gentleman3s case is completely5fistablishod.   I do not think that ;    under any conditions      ought to sell our old War heroes to the /    Easterns to be dealt with in their usual way - to be treated in a way in which they are too often, no doubt, treated in chose places, and where you have not got the same assurance with regard to the treatment of animals as you have here,   Ly Rrght Hon. Friend may congratulate himself, at any rate, upon tho fact that he has protected the horse from any possibility of maltreatment in the East,   So much for that topic   I hope my Right HonflFriend will consider that satisfactory^&quot;   (Official Report, 12th October 1916, oclumn 282).Instructions wore immediately cabled to the General Officers Commanding-in-Chief in E^ypt, Salonika and Mesopotamia, prohibiting the sale of animals cast from the Service.2,    On demobilization there will be a largo number of animals to dispose of in the above theatres, including horsaa, mules, and donkeys, seme no doubt war-worn, but the bulk of them young, eound and in good condition.     Owing to the demands of commerce and the repatriation of American and oversea troops few, if any, ships will be available   to transfer animals to other countries,The larger horses and mules will certainly bo out of placy in native hands, but for a considerable proportion of the whole there will be a fair demand locally and their services will bo needed for the reconstruction of the occupied territories in Mesopotamia and Palestine, and in Eastern Europe^hc mules are of American, Indian and Chinese origin; the bulk cf the horses ara Australian, Indian, and American, \ though they include fscmo few thousands of English animals.The numbers of animals now present in the abov&amp;-mentioned theatres aro roundly:-Horses 110,000Mules 133,000Donkeys 16,000Details of classifications are given in Table A attached.At tho conservative estimate of  25 per head, the sum involved in their destruction would bo 6% millions sterling.3,    The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is watching this question, and though ISr. Lloyd George referred to &quot;our old War horses&quot; only and the context indicates that horses cf ISn^lish ori-in were in the speaker^ nind, there is the same sentimental objection to exnosinT the Army^ animalsboth
206both Worses and mules, whatever their origin, to the risk of ill-treatment when their work is done,4o    This situation was placed by the War Office before the Ministry of Reconstruction who in turn referred it to the surplus Government Property Advisory Council,,   This Council recommended that &quot;animals no longer required by the Armies in the Eastern theatres of War should be disposed of to the best advantage&quot;, and on those lines Generals Commanding-in-Chief, are preparing their plans for demobilisation.Before,, however, the Army Council can act upon the recommendation ef the Surplus Government Property Advisory Council, they must ask for a decision as to whether lie,, Lloyd George * s answer in the House of Commons,, given as regards cast horses, is to be held to -govern the sale of all surplus animal3$ in the Eastern theatres in the altered circumstances of domobilisati/ / J1 (U ill
