F, Artillery. (ii) Retention of 4 gun battery * ^iijAmmunition Column in each groupiv) uedium howitzers instead of light.v) lie medium Trench mortars.[vi) Inclusion of a detachment for the repairs, and issue of Field  guns,. 11.0*8, light 3ieG&apos;s &amp; Rifles.Approximately 300 of the excess ,vf French O.R. personnel is due to their use of the 6&quot; Hows as co^pa^ed with 4&apos;,5 hows, but this still leaves an excess of lfi6 OJR.On the whole the British Artillery Organisation would appear to be the better than the French, and is certainly more economical For details see Appendices E*F.G.H. &amp; I,(e)   The Detachment of Telegraphists corresponds to the British Div. Si/nal Company,   The Unit is concerned with telegraphic tetephonic and wireless cormunication only, and has no ITotor Cyclists or visual Signallers.The responsibility of a telegraph detachment does not extend so far forward as that of a Div. Signal Company,Despatch riders are provided from the divisional Cavalry&apos;. If the telephonists and wireless personnel at II, i. Infantry Tieginents &amp; F* Artillery Regiment are added to the telcrraah detachment, the total is 6 Officers 320 O.R., as compared rith 12 Officers and 318 Q,R, in a British Div.

(e)   The establishment of the R.E. in a British Division exceeds that in a Pre noli Division by 10 Officers and 148 0.R, %        but the French have only 2 Field Companies and a Park as against 3 Field Companies in a British Division, and French Field Companies have no pontoons.cal      (f)   In comparing the total personnel it is necessary to add to the total of that in a French Division about   of the French Army Corps personnel.Even so the British liedical Personnel is on a much more generous scale the proportion being French 1 to every 20,7 6 men, British 1 to every 29.25 men.The question of some possible economy in the British liedical Service is, it is understood, how being enquired into. For details see Appendix M,isport, (g)   The systems in a French and British Division are different.In a British Division all 2nd Line Transport is concentrated in the Div. Train, whereas eaoh French Regiment or Group, etc., has its own Train Regimentaire.   There is no Div. M,T. Company allotted to a French Division, but each Array has Worries allotted to it on the following scale;-For each Division on a qufefc front the equivalent of 80 tons. For eaoh Division on an active front the equivalent of 200 tons.The British organisation is far more economical in horse transport though in II.T. possibly the French is the more economical.For details see Appendices N, &amp; 0.iti-      4.    No. of men of Service Auxiliatre or Category B. on.      In a French Division    ** 100In a British Division   ss 1,800If however the Pioneer Battalions are included the number in a French Division should be increased by about 800, as the Pioneer Battalions are composed of men of the territorial Army,   On the other hand, a British Pioneer Battalion is almost entirely composed of personnel similar to any other Infantry Battalion.It may be contended that the average man in the British Army of Category A. or General Service, attains a higher standard of physical fitness than the-average nan in the French Amy of service active.This we have no means of verifying, but even granting such a contention it would appear that as regards substitution in Divisions we have at least achieved as much, if not considerably more than have the French.The Frenoh Organisation of personnel is based on age primarily, and partially, and partially on physical fitness, where-as our organisation is based primarily on physical fitness, and only partially on age.In the French Army every effort is made to replace any young men in Arms other than Infantry, and inadministrative services, by older men, fathers with families, last surviving sons, sons of widows, etc.,Our system of posting recruits provides for the older men serving with units not in the front line, and much has been done to replaoe the young and fit men by the less fit, but it would hardly be possible at this st^ge of the war to apply the French system to our Army.einforce-    The French system of reinforcing is almost identical, with ents.   the British system.For details see Appendix P.
War Office, 21,9.18.Inclusion   6,      There is no doubt that amongst the French Staff I&apos; Officers the impression prevailing is that the organisationof a French Division is more economical than that of a British Division, and that the proportion of non-fighting to fighting men in a British Division is much larger than that in a French Division,The following are some of the reasons suggested for this impression,(a) British Divisions have generally held active parts of the lin*, when short fronts and large Reserves are the rule giving the British Areas a congested appearance,(b) The British are more in the habit of keeping in the open and are consequently more in evidence in Towns and Villages,(c) One of our national characteristics of decrying everything British and of assuming that foreign methods are better.   Some of our newspapers never oease to criticise the organisation and administration of the Army, of which the critics know little or nothing, thus inducing the public, both of our awn and other nations to believe that our methods are unbusinesslike, wasteful and impracticable.From the Appendices attached it will be seen that generally speaking the organisation of a British Division is at least as economical as that of a French Division, and that the organisation of the majority of the units composing a British Division is considerably more economical than that of the corresponding units in a French Division.

It wlill be seen that in spite of the fact that the British Division has a considerably larger Establishment,  the Establishment of the E*CV,  in a British Division is smaller.      This is chiefly due to the additional Staffs of the HoQ. infantry and H*q. Field Artillery in the French Division.Part of the Div.4 si onal Employment Company should be included in the Div.

K.T*Coy. has not &quot;been included, in the British Division, as in the French system all lorries are grouped under G.Q.G. or Armies.   On a front when active operations are in progress lorries are allocated to Armies on a scale of 80 per Div, (or 200 tons).   On other parts of the front lorries are allotted on a scale of 30 - 40 lorries (80 tons).   This system allows the same or more Motor transport to be allotted to Divisions on an active Yront, hut less on the quiet fronts, and is therefore probably more economical in lorries and in peroonnel and enables the lorries to he used for the transport of large bodies of troops. On the other hand the British system renders Divisions more independent and reduces the possibility of a breakdown in the transport of ammunition and supplies.The French system is organised with a view to retaining a large Motor Reserve in the hands of G.q,.G. for the transport of troops, if necessary at the expense of the Administration of Divisions.
