OTlESGCSyJor^m^l^,.*7      (3 October, 1918, FOREIGN OFFICE.^_____ GERMNl/016., ^jfe SITUATION IN GERMANY A ED PMCB 0TORTURES.242The fall of Rertling is undoubtedly the commencement of far-reaching changes in &amp;fj*ar^:.. . Of the greatest importance is the statement contained in the Emperor&apos;^ message to him; &quot;I desire that the German people shall cooperate more effectively than hitherto in deciding the fate of the Fatherland.     It is therefore my will that men who are sus-tained by the peopled trukt shall in a wide e: tent cooperate in the rights and duties of government.&quot; -This means that the agitation, which began in...July 191V., has for the moment attained success;   the government of Germany    . &quot; is to be one not merely responsible to the Tlnperor but depen-   &quot;&apos; dent on popular support.     This means that it should be a Government which has the confidence of the Reichstag;   in effect, it is the recognition..of some form of parliamentary government.In another Eemorandum the question is discussed as to the probable effect of any sucjj change on the internal oon&amp;ition of Germany.     It is obvious however that this event oannot be without its effect upon the diplomacy of the war.    Ever sinoe the beginning of the war, not only public opinion, but repeated utterances of responsible statesmen -especially in this country ,-have again and again insisted upon the point that we were at war not so much with the German ,.people as with the German Government, and that one of the main objects was to bring about a change both in the system and in the spirit.     It has moreover again and again been
suggested that the attitude of the Allies, and especially of this country and Amerioa, towards Germany, would he very different if we had to deal with a new form of Government. If we had a democratic Germany, a Germany with a popular form of Government, with parliamentary control, then - it has again and again been suggested - peace could be much more easily attained.    In its most extreme form this view has been expressed under the formula &quot;Ho peace with the hoben-aollarns&quot;. &apos;   Our Government, however, have never committed themselves to this, but have confined themselves to vaguer expressions.If, however, a Liberal Government, whether under Prince Max von Baden or someone else, is established, we may find ourselves suddenly confronted by a curious and rather embarrassing problem;   we may have the question put:   &quot;You have always given us to understand that an agreed peace would be made easy if you had to do, not with a Prussian reactionary military Government, but with one non-Prussian, of a liberal complexion and dependent on the suffrages of the people. Such a government there now is.     It is proposed to carry through the important constitutional changes, first the reform of the Prussian Franchise, and secondly the Constitutional law, whioh, in effect, prevents the Chancellor and Secretaries of State from being also members of the Reichstag.    By these changes Germany will at once enter the ranks of those States which have full parliamentary government.    The Reichstag in Germany is chosen by manhood- suffrage.    Me ask you therefore to redeem your pledges and to carry out your promise and at once to enter into negotiations for an agreed peace.&quot;All   indications seem to show that proposals for peace might be made on the basis of:
3*(IV  $he complete&apos;restoration of Belgian-Independence as BUg-feeted in the Belgian overtures, and there is evidence hat they would &quot;be prepared to consider reparation to Belgium.-(2) Evacuation of Prance.(3) A compromise about Alsace-Lorraine.(4$ Revision of the Brest Litovsk Treaties.(5) At least a partial restoration of the German Oolonies.(6)   Pull commercial equality and commercial facilities after the war.(7)   The establishment of a League of Nations based on the principles put forward by President lilson.The problem is bow an offer something of thisnature would have to bo met.     It would not concede all ourpoints and, in particular, we may be quite certain that theywill be very stiff about Alsace-Lorraine and-the Colonies.It would, however, be very easy for them to  represent that theyhad the right to expect that as soon as a new regime was estab-lished in Germany, we would be prepared to waive points onwhich we would have insisted as against the old regime.     Ifwe refuse to do so, the answer would oome at onoe that all ourtalk about the democratisation of Germany was mere war propa-ganda and hypocrisy;   as soon as we had got what we asked for,it became apparent that we had only taken this line in orderto weaken Germany&apos;s power of resistance and it had then becomequite obvious that our real aims were aggrandisement.    Theresult of this Would be twofold.     It would very greatlystrengthen the peace movement in this country and strengthenit against the Government.     In Germany it would be used toweaken the liberal movement and to Justify the military andreactionary parties.    It would strengthen and not weaken thespirit of resistance in Germany, and would conviroe the peopleof the truth of that which the Emperor and others have so.often insisted on, that they are in truth fighting a defensivewar.4
-4-The truth is that by demanding &quot;the democratisation of Germany&quot; we may easily get into a very awkward and delicate position.    The whole idea originally arose naturally from the circumstances of the origin of the war end was merely a v/ar measure against a specific tendency in a single country.   There are many who are attempting to invert it into a general prin-ciple aad are anxious to lay down the maxim that none but democratic btates should be admitted to the League cf Nations. Against this we oannot be too carefully on our guard.    At this moment we are chiefly occupied with the German Government, but tho weapon is one which might be used also by others and we may easily find that we are playing into the hands of international socialism or international labour.    V/e do not wish to have the discussion on changes in our own constitution carried on under external pressure.     It may be suggested that it would be wise as quickly as possible to get back to the old and sound prinoiple that the internal forms of government in any one nation are not the concern of other nations.    Even as regards Germany, it is not so much the forms of the con-stitution as the spirit of the nation with which we are at issue.     In particular, we must avoid being entangled in any discussion as to the particular changes in the constitution which would meet our demands.
