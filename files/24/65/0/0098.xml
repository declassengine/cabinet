Telegrams--sh.pm.nder, vic, london.&quot;   (This Document Is tlte Property.....m__:_--,     His glrltannlc fWalestVft ^nv^^uMtii4-uAny further communication on this subjoct should bo addressed to Tho Socrctary,Ministry of Shipping, St. Jamcs&apos;s Park.London, S.W. 1, and the following number quoted:-:MINISTRY OF SHIPPING, 7th October, 1918.Sir,&apos; In continuation of my letter of the 1st instant, I am directod by the Shipping Controller to report, for the information of the War Cabinet, as follows:-LOSSES AND GAINS OF BRITISH TONNAGE,279During the week ended the 23th September, the total number of vessels (500 ton3 gross and upwards) lost by enemy action was 6 ships of 17,864 gross tons.   Only one of these vessels was lost while in convoy.The total number of new vessels brought into service during the same period was 11 vessels of 52,124 gross tons including five standard steamers built in this country and two steamers built in British Columbia, making an apparent gain of 5 ships of 54, 260 gross tons.   One vessel of 1,525 gross tons was, however, incorrectly reported as completed in my last letter, and the net gain is therefore reduced to 4 ships of 52,735 gross tens.   Tho tonnage losses reported during the month of September were as follows:-Lost by enemy action &quot;   11   marine riskBritish only,148,144X X p 159,696All nationalties including Brjtlsb197,82764,549262,376SECRETARYWAR CABINET.
280  IOOKVOYS.Two statements are enclosed herewith showing (a) the number of convoys and tonnage convoyed to the 28th September, 1913, and (b) the percentage of steamers gross registered tonnage and deadweight capacity sunk on the different routes. FINANCE,*During the week ended the 28th ultimo, the sum of  693,860 was paid in compensation for loss of requisitioned ships, making a total of  31,12&apos;9,823 paid on this account since the 1st April, 1918. COAL POSITION.There is no sign whatever of any improvement in coal available for export which was looked for from the campaign for an increased output.Early in September a slight improvement was indicated, but for the week ended 21st September there was a drop in the total export and the quantity exported for the week ending 28th was below that for the previous week,   This was no doubt entirely due to the Railway strike in South Wales, which it is estimated lost 100,000 tons of coal to the country. The total amount available for shipment, as compared with the total minimum amount required for shipment, shows a deficit of about 22$.The Italian programme has been met, but the French programme continues to accumulate arrears, although this week the information received as to the position of the French ports indicates a considerable improvement, and many of the French ports could deal with more Colliers,The arrangements made to give some relief to the coal situation, by increasing shipments from South Africa, are now beginning to operate.   It naturally took some time to get the tonnage into position to load from South Africa, but there are 14 ships now loaded or ready to load in the next fortnightand/
3281and this will enable a reduction to be made in the amount of coal sent from here to Egypt. AMERICAN TROOPING.At a meeting of the Allied. Maritime Transport Council, at which Mr Baker, Secretary of State for War of the United States, was present, arrangements were made for the conveyance -by the Allies of a quantity of American Military Stores to Prance between now and the end of the year, in addition to the equivalent of any oil carried in American tonnage, in place of oil at present carried in double bottoms of British ships. STORES FOR THE BRITISH ARMY , IN FRftHCE,The quantity of military stores discharged in France in the week ending 28th September was 191,212 tons, compared with 160,078 tons during the previous week.   The quantity of military stores discharged in France during the 4 weeks ended 28th September was 677,813 tons. HOSPITAL SHIPS .At the request of the War Office reported to the War Cabinet preliminary arrangements are being made to send  a hospital ship to Archangel to act as a stationary hospital. TURKISH PRISONERS OF WAR,Owing to the congestion of Turkish prisoners of war in Egypt, steps have been taken to move 5,000 to Cyprus immed-iately.SUPPLIES FOR EGYPT.The influx of prisoners of war into Egypt has led to a heavy demand for additional supplies for that area. STORES FOR PALESTINEIn order to keep pace with the advance in Palestine, arrangements are being made to land stores and evacuate wounded at an additional port on the Palestine coast.
28211 *        SXGMHGH: 0Pt TOKISH AND jMTOH JSIggTOS OP WAR.Steps are being taken to prepare a cartel ship for the exchange of Turkish and British prisoners of war in the Aegean towards tho end of November.12 *      ROLLING STOCK IN PRANGS,&apos;rOwing to the activity on the Western Front a considera-able shortage of rolling stock has been created as a result of which the store service between Cherbourg and Taranto for the Eastern Theatres of War has been seriously interrupted, and vessels will have to be loaded in the United Kihgdom to carry stores by the all sea route, temporarily.13,      NEW TONNAGE CONSTRUCTED IN CANADA,The first wooden steamer to arrive in this country of those built to the order of this Ministry In Canada has arrived at Cardiff,   The vessel is the s/s &quot;WAR YUKON&quot; of 1400 tons net. She appears to be well built and well found and the Master reports that the ship behaved very well at sea and made a fine passage across the Atlantic at an average speed of about 10 knots. The s/s &quot;WAR DOG&quot;, a steel ship constructed In Canada, has also arrived at Cardiff and is reported to be an excellent example of ship construction both as regards hull and machinery,I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.)
