J For analysis, see pages 4 and/or 5,$ To ascertain the number of vessels actually in the service of the Allies on the date of this return the numbers given under I. and IV. on page 2 and in II. (ft) on page 3 must also be included. In addition, a number of vessels shown under ore. phosphates, lead, &amp;u., load outward for an Allied Government, A comparison of the numbers shown under IV. for the 8 months does not therefore give an accurate criterion of the vessels in Allied service at the different periods.f &quot;Requisition&quot; is here used to mean &quot;requisition for full Government service.&quot; The vessels shown as &quot;free from requisition &quot; therefore include the vessels that are requisitioned under the special liner requisitioning scheme : f SPECIAL LINER REQUISrilONINGr SCHEME:-. All liner trades are now requisitioned under special conditions, which, while leaving the vessels still under the manage-ment Of their owners, and free so far as circumstances permit to accept private as well as Government cargo, sscurs that the vessels are operated on Government account, the owners being paid on a Blue Book basis.II The decrease in &quot;the Liners shown under (4) on page 4 is due to the inclusion under IV. (a) on page 2 of Liners which are now definitely engaged in importing work for France and Italy. In addition, certain other vessels which were. previously shown under IV. (a) on page 2 have alt-o now been brought within the Liner Requisitioning scheme, so that, in all, there are n;.w ncluded under &quot;Trading for France and Italy&quot; respectively, the following vessels which are under Liner Requisition :t-France - - 32-170,375 G.T. Italy   -     -     -   36-152,034 G.T.tf Includes 26.vessels (65,736 G.T.) transferred from Norwegian flag under the Norwegian Agreement. As these require to be replaced in Norwegian service by British vessels they do not represent additional vessels available for British service.ip Prize and detained vessels, previously shown separately under VII. on page 2, were from 31st July onwards included with ordinary vessels in their relative categories. On the other hand, &quot; Vessels launched and completing,&quot; previously included under V. on page 2 and analysis (4) on page 4, were from 31st July onwards shown separately under VII, on page 2,
