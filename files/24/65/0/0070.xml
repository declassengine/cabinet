V      nIt204Southern 16/3547.WAR   CABINET.5* ^ *f ^  The Royal Air Force Reserve Depot at Blandford.Momorandum &quot;by the, Secretary of State for War,The memorandum (G.T.5600) dated the 3rd September 1918 to the War Cabinet, put forward by the First Commissioner of His Majesty1a Works &amp;o - proposing that all constructional work      \ for Government departments should be concentrated in one Department and indicating the Offite of Works as the Department on which this duty would naturally devolve, has received the careful consideration of the Army Council, who are of opinion that:&apos;-(l)   The Office of Works has not at present the machinery or&apos; the organisation which wculd enable it tc undertake the enormous expansion of its functions which the proposal entails. It would be many months before the enormous staff required for the proposed new duties could be get into working order and in the meantime very great confusion would be bound to arioe,(2)   There is nothing to show that the proposal would meet the admitted difficulties    The Office of Works urould be merely an agent department for the placing and administration of contracts, and could not be given authority to decide aa between Government Departments, to what works priority of execution should be accorded, or what works should be closed $own owing to insufficiency 6f available labour,(3)   The eontrol over rates of wages in the building trade (which it ia claimed might be exercised on consistent lines by the Office of Works) is the function for which the   Building Executive Committee, Ministry of Munitions, was brought into existence.    This is fully understood by all Departments concerned and increased rates of wages to attract labour are not in the least likely to be approved without the sanction oi&quot; this Committee.(4)   The Office of Works has not at its disposal the professional knowledge of military needs, which is essential for military requirements.(5)   It would be a very 3eriouo mistake to interfere in the manner proposed with the military organisation established at the War Office and in Commands under the Director of *Fortifications and Works for the construction of military works. The experienoe which Ecyal Engineer Officers are able to obtain at present through this organisation is considered essential for their training in view of the construotional work which has to be undertaken in theatres of war.In the ciroumstanaes the Council are unable to agree to Sir Alfred Mond1e proposal to transfar the responsibility for all Government works of construction to his Department, but they are prepared to concur in a recommendation that building operations to be undertaken in the future by Government &apos; Departments which have not already developed special organisations for this purpose should be carried out on their behalf by a Department having the necessary established organisation.3rd October 1C18. MILKER.
