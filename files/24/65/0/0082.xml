235Confidential.Political.Intelligence Department3rd October, 1918,Foreign Office, S3.W.I.RUSSIA/015.MEMORANDUMonTHE   UKRAINIAN   REVOLT.German and. Austrian military intervention and Skoropadsky&apos;s nevrly created militia, even at the height of their success, had been unable to extinguish the peasant revolt altogether, nor have they succeeded in completely disarming the peasants. Penal military expeditions were undertaken, and entire villages were burnt down; such measures cowed, but at the same time embittered the-peasants, and added recruits to the guerilla bands,    A stoppage of traffic is now reported on the Volotchisk-Odessa railway line, which would seem to indicate that the movement has, at least temporarily, gained the upper hand in the Austrian sphere of occupation.    A German withdrawal of troops from the Ukraine is reported to be imminent,,and obviously they must efcooaft between living *ts*o&amp;g; gmrrlftona or nans at all, toeo&amp;uae small det&amp;ohments voulcl certainly be overpowered by the peasants.    But a complete withdrawal, followed by a new revolution in the Ukraine on the very frontier of East Galicia, may produce most;serious consequences in Austria.On September Snd an official notice was posted at the Lemberg railway station announcinc; that traffic ha-, been stopped on the Volotchisk-Odessa railway.    This line is a continuation ox the main Galician railway.Craoow-Lemberg-

It falls entirely into the Austrian sphere of occupation, the river Boh forming approximately the line of demarcation between the Austrian and German spheres leaving the towns of Proskurov, Litin, Vinnitsa, Human and Olgopol on the Austrian side. -Peasant revolts caused by the requisitioning of the harvest are reported to have been the cause of this stoppage, and are said to be spreading daily.    In the first half of September the following two official army orders showing the seriousness of the situation were published in the Austrian sphere of occupa-tion:*-&quot;The possession of bombs, hand grenades or other explosives is in itself a proof of planning attempts and constitutes a crime against the armed forces of the State.    A state of siege is therefore proclaimed in the sphere of the Austro-Hungarian administration^ and &apos;  every transgression will be punished with death.&quot;The second order runs as followsj*&quot;Rumours have been spread recently about an Imminent general strike which is to lead to a change in the political situation of the Ukraine.    Agents attempt to provoke disorders throughout the country. The population of Odessa and surroundings has hitherto maintained peace.    We hope that in the future also, we shall be able to count on a friendly attitude on their part, and we call upon all the inhabitants to abstain from having anything to do with the revolution-ary movement, but to help in combatting It.    We notify the population that all preparations have been made for the severest  repression of the revolution, should the agitators succeed in provoking it.    The part of the town wherein the revolutionary movement begins is threatened with destruction by artillery.&quot;Guerilla warfare has never ceased in the Ukraine throughoutthe spring and summer, but has merely subsided in some districts,to revive in others.    In the late autumn and winter of 1917 therevolt was fieroest in Podolia and Volhynias in the spring itwas serious in Poltava; this summer It raged in the Governmentof Kiev.    In Volhynia a strong militia had been organised underthe auspices of the Germans, and of Skoropadsky and with the helpof the Polish landowners, by the new Governor, M, Andro, a Russian
* 237** 3 *&quot;o:-? the landowning class who had served under the anoien regime. A detaoliment was assigned to every village, and moreover special detachments for penal expeditions were distributed throughout the province.    Similar organisations, were -created also in other parts of the Ukraine.    Yet all the troops and militia&apos;could not altogether extinguish the revolt.    There were regular guerilla hands, frequently over a thousand men strong and armed with guns and machine guns, whioh roamed through the country secretly supported by the peasants /among whom their- chiefs Hrebenlco, Angel, Shinkazh etc. have by now achieved legendarian fame. These bands frequently attacked even regular troops and then quickly disappeared.without trace.    It was not until after many months that the Germans succeeded, e.g., in destroying&apos;: most of Hrebenlco1 a band north-east of Poltava.    Naturally one hears but seldom of these battles fought by the Ukrainian peasant bands against Austrian and German soldiers - only incidentally some writer blabs out and the censor overlooks the slip.    Thus, for instance, the following reference to an otherwise unknown massacre of German soldiers can be found in an article on the Ukraine written by a Dr. von Dbbay and published in the Vienna &quot;Neue Preie Presse&quot; of August 4th; &quot;Unfortunately it is not always easy to restore order: bloody encounters cannot be avoided, as is shown by the recent sad incident at Yekaterinoslav, the ghastly tragddy of the heroic Lieutenant Franz Heinrich and his 72 men.i!Apart from action by organised bands, one may note, a very considerable number of minor outbreaks in country which; officially at least, had already been paoified.    Information about these outbreaks, which frequently result in the massacre of big landowners, officials or detachments of militia, is much more plentiful, and a3 most of the big landowners in the Western Ukraine are Pole,j, considerable spaoe Is devoted to them by the Polish press in Galicia.     Equally frequent are pogroms of Jews, but these no one seems to take tho trouble to recount. ,/
2383.        The local outbreaks are interesting because they give an P Idea of the potentialities of revolt which there are in the Ukraine.    As examples - two from among many - may be quoted the massacres in the sugar factory of Luka in the Government of Kiev close to the Kiev-Odessa railway line, and at Avratin on the very frontier of Galicia north of Volotchisk. - 20 German soldiers stationed at the sugar factory at Luka had been wlth-drawn In the afternoon of June 12th, whereupon the peasants from the five surrounding villages at once prepared an  attack, which was delivered at two o&apos;clock in the morning of June 13th, and ended in a massacre of all the offioials and refugees who were in the factory, men and women.    At Avratin the pogrom was caused by the manager of the estate drying with the help of the militia to enforce payment for damages caused by the peasants during the revolution.    The militia were 40 men strong but had only revolvers and sabres, whereas the peasants had guns, machine guns and hand grenades.     30 of the militia and the Polish manager himself were killed or wounded, and the wounded were clubbed to death.    As punishment a detachment of Austrian Uhlans stationed at Volotchisk surrounded Avratin, burnt down the village and scattered its inhabitants.    No better method could have been devised for providing recruits for the guerilla bands -which has been effectively done by penal expeditions throughout the Ukraine.Lastly, a very interesting description may be quoted given by a Polish nobleman who in July had visited his estate in Podolia, only soma 30 miles from the Galician frontier.     Of his chateau, farm buildings etc. he found hardly a trace - &quot;Do not leave a single brick,&quot; had been the cry of the peasants, &quot;or the old fellow will return to that brick.&quot;    And not merely the Ukrainian peasantry, but even the petty Polish gentry, v/hlch, but for claims to nobility, differs hardly at all tTom the peasants, had taken part in the looting.    Now the &quot;old fellow&quot;
*&quot; 5 **239came bade with a bodyguard of Magyar Honveds in full war kit. ^  &quot;A few young peasants who had served in the Russian army, when met in the road, looked at me in a hostile manner.    I am not astonished that my manager goes every night to the neighbouring town, although the peasant community has in writing guaranteed the safety of his life.    A few days ago the peasants massacred all the officials on the estate Koszowata, although they them-selves had invited them to return.&quot; 4. During the summer the peasant hafi been busy gathering theharvest.    By the middle of October the retraining work in the fields - the digging of potatoes and sowing of winter crops -will have been finished.    This is therefore the most suitable time for a peasant movement; the peasant has time to ponder over his &quot;grievances&quot; and there is something to seize.    LaBt winter he expected the land and crops to remain his.    This summer the big landowners, supported and protected by the German and Austrian troops and by local militias, have regained the land and retained a very considerable part of the produce. As soon as the peasant feels that this restraining force has broken down, he will rise again, and news among the Ukrainian peasants travels with the same uncanny rapidity as among African tribes.    The writer himself once saw how Within a few days an agrarian strike spread through about a -thousand villages, and how a village perfectly quiet at night and to all appearance unconscious of any impending movement, was in full revolt the next morning.When the new revolution breaks out in the Ukraine it will probably be of the fiercest character and will surpass even that of last winter.    Big landowners, Polish intelligentsia and Jews are likely to be massacred without discrimination, and not even the clergy, especially not the Roman Catholic clergy, will be safe.    One may expect a return to the days of the Cossack Hetman Bohdan Khmelsitsky, when nobles, Jews and Roman Catholic* &apos;i
- 6240priests were hanged, on the Bame trees by the revolting peasants; A Ukrainian peasant revolt stops short at nothing.The following paragraph from the graphic description by the Polish nobleman, who was quoted above, of the visit to his estate in Podolia shows how even religion, the one spiritual factor in the life of the peasant, breaks do^/n in an agrarian movement:&quot;Near the lake, in a semi-circle of dark fir trees, on a high column, with distant clouds for background, stands a statue of the Holy Virgin, so calm5 so marvellous, so high above human hatred and crime.     We go towards it, fall on our knees and,.bears deep marks of bullet shots.    An old servant tells me that the peasants from across the lake shot at the statue -it was mere accident that they hit the column and did not smash the statue.     Lord, how savage the village has grown in the course of the war!    He tells me also that young Zielonka shot at the statue cf St. John, which since time immemorial has stood, in the village near the lake, and he continued until he had shot off its head.    And this although the Zielonkas are Roman Catholics, Poles.    The young apostate!&quot; 5. On the other sirle of the Austrian frontier, in East Galicia,conditions are the same as in the Ukraine, except lhat the peasant-^ry is much better educated and therefore much more revolution-ised (the writer remembers having heard how some ten years before the war a village in the district of Zbarazh, expecting a visitfrom its bishop, put /km. arch of triumph for him bearing the Inscription &quot;We do not believe any longer&quot;); they have been hit much more severely by the war and are thus much more em-bittered and exasperated; and the hatred of:the Polish-Austrian regime is very much stronger than the hatred of the Russian government had ever been in the Ukraine.     If the revolution breaks out in the Ukraine once more, if the Galician peasants hear of a retreat of German and Austrian troops and a new waroh horror, we refuse to believe our eyes.     The wooden column
*7breaks out in Roumania, then a peasant revolt in Galiola seems almost unavoidable.     Such a revolution would terrify the Polish upper and middle classes, possibly even the right wing of the Polish Socialists and of the Vienna Socialists.     But as a social revolutionary movement It would probably spread fast into Western Galicia and Hungary,;- and the Czecho-Slovaks and Jugo-Slavs would probably find it a convenient opportunity for decisive action against, the Austrian and-Hungarian.governments.For us- it&quot;is important to note that the Ukrainian peasant movement, if successful, constitutes&apos;a deadly menace to the Central Powers.; but it is a movement with which, we could never ally ourselves, nor could we suppress, at least not while the war continues.     When we get into the Black Sea, for military reasons it may be necessary to seize the Crimea, Odessa and some other harbours, but it would seem advisable to leave the interior of the Ukraine alone and much rather direct all our activities along the Don towards the Cossack country with a view to linking up with the Volga country.
