Endeavours were made by the Italians to destroy the machine by artillery fire, but with what result is not known. The other machines returned safely.On 24th September three enemy machines attacked Mudros and destroyed the sea-plane station at Talikna, including three hangars, ten seaplanes, a repair shop and a quantity of stores. There were no casualties. Bombs were also dropped in Mudros East, killing one native and wounding 2 others. Steps were immediately taken to replace the seaplanes, plant, &amp;c.(C1428)  Wt. -  50   10/18  B * S A
2ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines During the week under review, from 24 to 26 large enemy submarines of a type which-operating.   0perates further afield than the North Sea, were located.  Amongst these were six of the&quot; cruiser &quot; type, of which one was working off the Azores and one off the North AmericanCoast; three, including a large minelayer, were proceeding westwards across the Atlantic,and one minelayer was returning from North American waters.In Home Waters, submarines were operating in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel,in the western approaches of the English Channel and off the north-east coast of England,but very few attacks were made.The enemy is showing increasing reluctance to make the passage of the Dover Straits,and boats from Zeebrugge now frequently go north-about to operate in the western partof the English Channel.Aotions The following Table shows the number of actions between Allied craft and enemyrabmarineJ SUDmarines which are reported to have taken place in all waters during recent weeks es&apos; and the nature of the craft which have been engaged ; and also the number of submarines which have been destroyed or lost to the enemy as the result of such actions : 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Sept. 7th.

A violent under-water explosion occurred, and there is good ground for hoping that the enemy was destroyed.Number and ton-nage of all vessels sunk.MERCANTILE LOSSES BY ENEMY ACTION.   -The following is a Comparative Statement of the Number and Tonnage of all Merchant Vessels sunk in recent weeks by enemy action : 	British Vessels.

252The losses of World Tonnage owing to enemy action during the week under review are the lowest recorded in any week since the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare excepting the week ended May 25th, when 11 vessels, aggregating 17,941 tons, were sunk.It will be seen that the losses this week are almost entirely of British vessels, only one small Belgian steamship and no neutral vessel being included in the total.  .AreasThe Table in the Appendix is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign in which as well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by vessels lost, enemy craft and by mine, classified according to areas.It will be seen that in all areas enemy activity was comparatively slight.   In Home Waters only five attacks were made, as compared with 27 in the previous week.VesselsThe number of British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing in organised Convoy 0OIlvOye(jt which completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst in such Convoys, compared with corresponding figures for previous periods, are as follows : 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		7th Sept., 1918.		14th Sept., 1918.		21st Sept., 1918.		28th Sept., 1918.

No enemy mines have beeD laid in British minesweeping areas during the week under Minelaying. review.  A special Sweeping Force operating of! the coast of Palestine swept up seven enemy mines when clearing a channel into the Bay of Acre.(C 1428) ^ A 2

No British merchant vessel has been sunk by mine since the first week in June.During the week under review a Dutch merchantman was damaged by mine in a prohibited area to the eastward of Lowestoft.Oompara-tive state-ment of U.E.sailings in 1918.UNITED KINGDOM SAILINGS.The following is a Comparative Statement of sailings to and from the United Kingdom during the present year, grouped as to Trade and Flag : 	January-March					April-June							(Monthly average).

No enemy ships have entered or left Rotterdam.
FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.Russia.The flotilla operating on the Northern Dvina has made considerable progress and has inflicted great losses on the enemy. Several mines have been met with, and the advance is temporarily delayed while sweeping is in progress.It having been reported that bombs had been placed on board four different steamers before their departure from Archangel, General Poole has taken steps to have guards placed on all ships in that port. Tie labour situation at Archangel is very complex and strikes are of daily occurrence..An unconfirmed report states that Colonel Duroff has been nominated as Governor-General of Archangel, where he will be subservient only to the Central Government at Samara. Admiral Ivanoff, Russian Senior Naval Officer at Archangel, has been dismissed without reason by the Government.No more United States troops will be sent to Northern Russian ports.As a result of the recent Karelian victory at Ukhta, considerable numbers of new recruits have been enrolled for service.A Russian W/T message of 24th September states that owing to the occupation of Krasnovodsk, Fort Alexandrovsk and Petrovsk by the British, and of Baku by the Turks, any naval expedition on the Caspian is postponed.Commodore Norris reports that the Caspian Fleet is disorganised and under the absolute control of Bicharakov, who would consider any attempt at bribery or purchase as a sign of weakness. The Commodore proposes to ignore the fleet so long as it remains inactive, and meanwhile will press on with the arming of steamers under his control. Of these he has about 37 at Enzeli and 2 at Krasnovodsk, while he reports the presence of 11 at Baku and of 17 at Petrovsk.Naval Staff.3rd October, 1918.
