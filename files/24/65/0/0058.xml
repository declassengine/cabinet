-MUui.*   I vm 0ABlaa!t(J.T.TH38 ITOSTRIAL RESOURCES 01 XRELAHD.Memorandum bt tho Lord Lieutenant and Chief Ssfor Ireland^During the recess the Chief Secretary has ma do as exhaustive an investigation as was possible in tho titan into the industrial resources of Ireland tihioh are still uncte**lo$*l or not developed to the extent to whiten they night and should be. As a result of hie investigations we desire to bring a definite proposal before tho Cabinet *As briefly as passible we will state the opinions we have formed m to what: might &quot;be dona i*1*   AQRICTOLTOT..Agriculture is the Bts.ple industry of Ireland.   Since tho establishment of the Department, of Agriculture great, a.dv$a,ce.s have been made in&apos;lie development- and much excellent work &apos;ha&amp; boon-done by -that BepaHraent&apos;*    There is, however, still room for&apos; greater improvement and development, an improvement and     .  .&apos;; development which will become increasingly necessary owing to diminished imports to be expected from worth and South America,. Canada, Australia, $few Zealand, Denmark, Russia, ate.The Department are quite alive to the necessity of further efforts on their part and are taking all stops they are able to take j   but in many respects the.y will %o greatly assisted if tho proposals which we desire to set before the Cabinet are acceded to,,     In our view special attention should bo given, amongst other things, to the following:- .(a) The reclamation of land and tho extension of tho area of agricultural land.    There are many areas which are at present useless, which could be made into rich land.   3?or example, there are areas which could &quot;be reclaimed &quot;by means of arterial drainage, others by means of the -building- of sea wal.lt, and others by the fertilisation -of bog*land after the peat has been cub and used. , &apos;(b) - An. improvement in the breeding of livestock of -all kindsv  The grading and registration of bulls,- r&amp;ms-and boars, as is the ease with stallions at present.   The cure of warrables$ and generally the improvement of hides for the tanning industry. Already a rich company have started to develop the slaughterin i*h Ireland of Irish*brod and fattened cattle, the-result of which will be an enormous saving ef shipping1 tonnage, (4 slaughtered animals cm travel in the same space as one living), and in addition will enable the allied industries - tanning, etc* * to be developed. They have- started already in Drogheda and they are completing arrangements with&apos;the publin Corporation to erect a large abattoir cold storage and tannery and all the other appurtenances of the trade in part of the reclaimed area, at North Wall.    Many of those allied industries, e.g., button*making, glue faotorl.es etc., night usefully be carried on by smaller people if they had. the necessary help to commence operations.
The question of winter dairying..Flax, f . A most important question is that o  the ) improvement of flax culture and treatment in the North-of Ireland and the relii&amp;&amp;$$&amp;m of  lax into the South and West.   This year the acreage under flax in the South and West was increased from about 600 acreaf to something over 8^000 sores, and there is every reason to believe that the acreage can be very much extended, at a profit.   The system of dealing with the flass is very ancient and far from economical.   Much might be done to concentrate and economise the work of pulling, retting and scutching, and one company in the North of Ireland have built experimental factories for the pur-pose,   They are developing a machine which will pull and de-seed the flax, thus enabling a great portion of the seed to be saved which would otherwise be lost, and they are retting and scutching the flax under one roof and so enabling it to be sent ready to spin straight or practically straight from t he area in which it is grown to the spinner.    Similar factories should, in our opinion, be set up in various parts of the South and $eat of Ireland where the flax will be grown, and we feel confident that if that were done spinning and weaving would very soon follow and thus a large industrial population with all the stable qualities which an industrial population possesses might be spread over the South and West of Irelando   We think it highly desirable that the farmers themselves should own and work some of the factories rather than that they should all be owned and worked by large and rich companies.   Help should be given to farmers to co-operate for the purpose of erecting and working their own factories.    That farmers can and -will co-operate for such purposes is shown by highly successful co-operative creameries *Market Gardening.    We believe that there is room Tor the extension of market gardening and.for the education of those, especially women,, who might be engaged in that occupation^   Two farms in the near neighbourhood of Dublin are used for the purpose of educating girls taken from the lowest and poorest classes in Dublin in market gardening, and the results appear to be admirable *Experiments.    We need only mention the questions of sugar-beet &quot;and tobacco to instance directions in which experiments might properly be carried out by Government.   If good results were obtained, and if the land proved to be suitable for, e,g., ihe growth of beet and tobacco, a widely extended system of mills and small industrial populations would follow.
2 .uJ?lSERIES .Tnere is much that might &quot;be done to assist those engaged in the fishing industry to develop and improve their methods. There is room for a larger volume of trade both in fresh and in cured fish.    But for that purpose adequate transport and a larger number of small piers and harbours arc essential.    To give one instance, there is a considerable fishing and curing trade in the Kenm&amp;re Biver, but they are greatly hampered for want of harbourage and transport.     There a gentleman of sufficient and public spirit has purchased two motor boats. They will collect every morning the fresh fish, take it up to Kenmare and there put it on railj   but they are still hampered by very inadequate harbour accommodation.There are many other places in Ireland where a similar system of collecting the fish and of taking it to rail could be set up.    With proper harbourage and an increased number of curing, icing, and canning stations a much more profitable industry might be developed.     If, as- is highly desirable, the small men engaged in the industry could be induced to co-operate for tho^S-e purposes, financial aid, such as we suggest later, would enable them to do so.The Irish Sub-Committee of the Parliamentary Committee of Inland Transport have made very searching inquiries regarding Irish harbours and we expect their recommendations will be of great value to ub*The mineral deposits of Iteland are numerous;   but how rich and how far they are capable of profitable working it is difficult at present to say.    There exist undoubtedly ooal, , lignite, iron ore, copper, lead, zinc, sulpher,&apos;ochre, flag-stone and many other descriptions of minerals.     Coal undoubtedly exists in substantial quantities and is-capable of profitable working.-.    There are three mines;-   Arigna, &quot;v-olfhill and Gastiecomer, which have been worked for some time and which are making strenuous efforts to increase their output in order to meet the inevitable coal shortage of the coming winter, But in every case they have been seriously handicapped in the past by inadequate transport.    At Arigna, where thero are large deposits of coal and iron stone, the coal has had to be distributed by farmers1 carts and pack horses.    With such a , system of transport increase.of output was impossible.    The Board of Trade has authorised the extension of the Arigna branch ^of the Cavan and Leitrim Light Kailway up the Arigna valley and the Companies working the mines are preparing the necessary means to bring the coal down to that extended railway. It is hoped and believed that the -result of the buildin.3 of th&amp;t railway will be to increase the output to a very great extent, and when things settle down after the war the line can then be extended in two directions, which will enable the Arigna coalfield to be still further developed and to supply places like Sligo and Limerick on the west coast of Ireland.
m   4   -Wolfhill and Caatlecomer both have be^n supplied with rail transport, the railway serving the various pits of the Wolfhill nines is practically complete, that serving the various pitn of the Castlocomer minoa is atill under construction.   The Wolfhill Company estimate the output that they will be able to achieve will rise from 5CO tons per day to 1,000 tons per day. The Caetlecomer Company estimate that they will be able, when the rail is complete, to put out 200,000 tons per annum.   The combination ought to be of great value to the large towns in tho south-east and south of Ireland. There are at Avoca, Glendalough, Allihiee, and other places mince of ochre, sulphur, lead and copper which have bean visited by the Chief Secretary who is advised by the expert who accompanied him that they are worthy of development.   They have been worked in the past, but in a very primitive and inefficient manner, and, as is the caso with many other mines in Ireland, could, if efficiently worked, be made profitably to supply local needs.4.     BOGS.The question of peat has exercised the minds of many persons interested in the subject for many years. Up to the present no satisfactory results have been achieved.   Peat is now/practically for heating purposes only.   It might be used for many other valuable purposes.The Chief Secretary has had the advantage of seeing the Report which the Irish Peat Inquiry Committee made for the Fuel Research Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and the Report and recommendations of the Fuel Research Board upon it. If the results of those recommendations are satisfactory much could be done to establish over the large bog lands of Ireland peat industries of various kinds which would produce not only fuel and power but many bye-products and would give useful and profitable work to a substantial population.5..   RAILWAYS. CAHALS AKD RIVERS*We find that a mistake was made in building light railways of a different gauge to the main railways of the country.   It leads to great expense in handling and it would be an obvious advantage if a wagon loaded at the pit-mouth could run down the light railways straight on to the main railways and straight to the consumer. As it ift, in many cases products of all kinds which are Carried over light railways have to be handled again, When they join the main railways, and we believe that one of the worka which must be undertaken when matters are normal and ouch things could be undertaken will be the broadening the gauge of the light railways of Ireland.
The canal8 in Ireland could oertainly &quot;be used to much greater advantage, and, if the email industrial centres are scattered about Ireland in the way vre hope and suggest, canals might be made of immense value in taking the products produced in those.&apos; small areas to the larger areas, such, as Belfast,. Dublin, Waterford, Cork,and so on for sale.   We are also of opinion that in the future motor carriage by roid Y/ill be an essential part of such industries as we have outlined.   As Chairman of the Departmental Committee of the Local Government Board on Heavy Motor Traffic, the Chief Secretary had the advantage of hearing a quantity of evidence dealing with the subject of locomotives and motors for industrial purposes on highways.   We think that the time will come when the great main roads of Ireland as of other countries will become a national and not a local matter, and vre are further satisfied that roads could be constructed and maintained at reasonable cost which would carry the locomotive traffio which would enable produoe of all kinds from fish to flax to be carried about expe-ditiously and economically.There are many other industries which we do not desire to mention in detail, for example:- lace, wool, and flour, where local centres of industry could be set up, but where financial assistance may be required to enable them to start.In addition to transport there is the question of power,   fe have already mentioned the question of the fuller use of peat, one direction being for the generating of power, and an Irish Sub-Comnittee has been set up by the President of the Board of Trade to, enquire^ into. the....,.,, whole qu^s^Idn;6f &apos;water-po,vrer in Ireland.i ;-7e &quot;feel very strongly &quot;-that vlf&apos;/: - as :we hope ;andVb^ be4;&apos; the &apos;&apos; case,it recommends means by &quot;which the water- ^ower of Ireland &quot;ov&apos; -o&apos;ah be uv4e&apos;d in many districts f or /the generating &apos;of &apos; eleet rlcal pdwer&apos;t we should&apos;:be in;a: po siti on&apos; to &apos; giye&quot;the &apos; ne&quot;cessary assistance&quot; -&quot;to develop that power. / ^ &apos;      &apos;     ^&apos; * &apos; -J-n addition to : the&apos; question of the : development of ;;: industry -to -which ;-we attach the&quot;highest importance/ as   .&apos;&apos; a means of Improving ;andstabilising the whole condition c&apos;f Ireland and rthe &quot;Irish people, vverv important questions arise in the matter *6f reducatl6nv   We have found during the few mdnths that&apos;&quot;-We have been in Ireland, that snail grievances felt &quot;&apos;by the teachers, ;both primary and ;interi-mediate; even i&apos;f &quot;Without f oundatio-n, are ^productive of a great deal that is harmful&apos;&apos;. &apos; In Ireland teachers .appear;; to ru&apos;s :to have la greater inf luerice in developing and ^    &apos; directing the&quot; -minds -arid thoughts of their pupils &apos;than&apos; they have in $hglahd and Scotland, &apos;and&quot; a discontented : body &apos;&apos;of -teachera&quot;, -whd feel&apos;-that they have a grievance against the Imperial Government, has in.our opinion been $reductive&apos;of &apos;a great deal of&apos; harm&apos;.   We feel &quot;verjr strongly -that if1 :we were able -not - only to consider but to deal with &apos;and remed^-^e-^e^tl-ti^sliy those small grievances we;.;/  ;. should ^do much to- Improve the ire&apos;nd of thou&apos;3it:: inculcated&apos; ; &apos; into the Irish child.
The proposal we put before the Cabinet$0 ft net, to    , enable us, whenever we are advised that ft; is, desirable, to give necessary financial assistance if otf the purposes we have outlined, there should be placed at the disposal of the Irish Government a^umof two million pounds. 1 We do not propose that a system of grants&quot; should be continued,, such as has existed&apos;in the past. ;We do not believe that industries are ever really developed by grants in aid involving ne ?J&apos;: liability upon the receiver.     &quot;We should proprse that, .whero people wish to develop an industry and&quot; are not in a financial position to-do &apos;so without assistance, we should be able to &apos; advanoe&apos;;t&apos;hem&quot;money/&quot;on loan at rates of interest and on terms of repayment which are fair and&quot;equitable in the circumstances of each case and on the security of the undertaking.    We are satisfied, from the way in which the payments of land-purohase annuities have been maintained that&apos;we could-with. oOnfidenoe look forward to a very small number of bad debts.We have also considered carefully i-th^Question of the&quot; moans by which the Government could be^dvis&amp;d which projects were worthy of    support both from tlie.&apos;p6intT6f.view of profitable working and from the point..-of \vfew^of theoharacter of the people who propose to undertake&quot;the;&apos;Work. 1 For&apos; that&apos;&quot; purpose we have, decided .to ask a number &quot;of&quot;:&apos;gohti&quot;emen to give us the benefit of their advice as an unofficial unpaid advisory committee.   We consider that the Chairman of that Committee should be a man of experience in the trade of Ireland and other countries especially from&apos; the--point\of view of transport with a keen insight into all classes of business in the country, and a man who could be trusted&apos;to obtain for himself the most expert advice, obtainable/in each particular field of industry, and with the assistance of that expert advice, to guide the Government.    we  ire glad to say a gentleman who answers to all of those&apos; qualifications - Mr. H.G, Burgess - has, consented, to become the Chairman.   For the purpose of the coal mines a&apos;well-known and highly experienced mining engineer from the north of&apos; England, who has been for years known to.the Chief Secretary, has consented to go over to Ireland this week and go round the collieries with Mr, Burgess and give him the benefit of his expert advice.    With regard to the&apos; other mines the Department of Agriculture has kindly consented that the services of their mineralogical expert * Mr-. Lyburn- should be at ifr. Burgess&apos; disposal whenever he requires them.   With regard to the other industries, the development of flax, the development of fisheries, etc,, there are in Ireland gentlemen of wide experience who would also place their services at ir, Burgess&apos; disposal, and wo feel that with such a Committee to guide,them the Irish Government would be enabled to use the two:&apos;millions wisely and profitably and with small chanoe of any //substantial proportion of that sum being ultimately lost, to the State,,Mr, Burgess will also undertake-the/duty; of seeing that when money was advanced for any projeo,t,ed ;work&apos;,./,t hat work should be thoroughly &apos;carried out. v - ,Vvre would ask further that in any case in which at present it is necessary that the consent of a Department of the Imperial Government should be obtained before any works can be executed, that necessity should be taken away,   Of course we do not suggest that in any question of broad policy, which affects the United Kingdom, the Irish Government should be empowered to act contrary to the policy laid down by the Central Government, but in matters of detail where, as is oftenthe
the oase, ]us dat qui cito dat, we ask tfcut the Irish Government should have an entirely free hand,   we are satisr fied that if these powers are given and this money is provided, whoever may constitute the Irish Government, v/ill hove the opportunity, if they choose to avail, thtmselves of it, to do immense good both materially rnd politically to the Irish people.(Sd.)
