tank wagrqns :fqr frmobi a1tb italy.the governments of france and italy have made urgent appeals to his majesty&apos;s government for 220 railway tank wagons to meet a critical situation in the distribution of petrol and kerosene to their armies and civil population.the rapid increase in motor transport - and aerial warfare has created a serious demand on the tank wagon re-sources cf the two countries, and the supply at present available on the continent is insufficient for military and civil needs.the tank storage available at the various importing centres in the two countries is at times, through the lack of essential means of distribution, full to its utmost capacity.   shins continue to arrive and no storage accommc-dation is available for their cargoes,   the result is ccn-gestion at the ports, delay in berthing, and, in many cases diversion to other destinations.    but compliance with the requests of france and italy will do much to alleviate the shipping situation, and concurrent action is being taken to increase the storage capacity at both french and italian ports.i am asking the minister of munitions to take the necessary action to commandeer the requisite number of Wagons, and, in order to disturb the traffic as little as possible by reason cf the withdrawal of these wagons and to make it more efficient, the board of trade are about to appoint an organization to control the tank wagon service in the united kingdom.w.h.l.2nd october, 1918.
