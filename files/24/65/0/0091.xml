4^2lS^v     JI!^^rd-!I?rii5      Property of &apos; &apos; 1*uJi^J^f ...............- 26&apos;ffi^hor Memorandum by Admiralty for tho. War Cabinet.In tho absoneo of tho First Lord it is ny duty to make somo observations on tho Memorandum (OK, T6 5827) by tho Minister of Munition SoI do not propose to follow Mr, Churchill in his excursion into questions of IJaval Policy,     These have for tho most part already boon determined by tho War Cabinet on the responsible advice of the AdmiraltyThere are, however, certain misapprehensions apparent in liTo Churchill&apos;s memorandum which ought to be cleared&apos; away. The submarine position cannot be regarded with the complacency which he assumes.     In a paper by the First Lord which&quot;was recently before the Cabinet&quot;, it was shown that the withdrawal of British Destroyers for. the convoy of American troops and stores .during the last few months has resulted in loss hunting of submarines and decreased destruction of them.     At the same tine tyio Germans have been increasing their building.   By the end of this year Germany will have a larger submarine fleet than she has had at any time during the War, and many of tho individual units will be more powerfully armed and have a greater radius of action than those hitherto encountered. We are bound to anticipate increased difficulties in dealing with them,     ALroady arried merchantmen  are finding their guns outranged, and an extension of tho convoy system may have to be facec&quot;L     The Admiralty in this matter is not the subject of any &quot;vague scared     It only seeks to deal adequate-ly with a situation which requires that ovory reasonable precaution should be taken.&apos;   The air squadrons at the service of the Admiralty - to whoso number tho Minister of Munitions takes objection -are not only necessary as bombing squadrons, and as auxiliaries of tho Fleet; they are also ono of tho most effective means of combating the submarine; and very largonumbers are required for the extensive patrols and convoy work which must be perpetually carried on.     In the lightof the knowledge possessed by the Admiralty, the -number ofmachines and personnel employed falls considerably short ofthe needs of the situation,Mr, Ohurchill docs not appear to be aware that theR.N.A.S. no longer exists, and that it is merged in theR. A.P,        The comparison which he desiderates would thereforefall to be made between the work of the R. A.F. in France andthe machines which tho R.A.F, makes available to the Admiralty,but the duties performed are in no way comparable, and successis represented by results totally different in character.   Itseems aknost unnecessary to point out that the number of bombsdropped and submarines destroyed cannot possibly afford anymeasure of tho work which the aircraft in Adiairalty serviceare performing.(Signed).   R.E0 YTEMYSS5th October 1618.
