WAR CABINET.

APPRENTICESHIP INTERRUPTED BY WAR SERVICE.

The Committee of Home Affairs of the War Cabinet have requested the Labour Department of the Ministry of Munitions to state their views on the proposals of the Ministry of Labour on this subject (G.221).

This Department desire to emphasise the obvious desirability, referred to in the Ministry of Labour memorandum, of securing that the maximum number of demobilised apprentices should resume their occupations as skilled craftsmen, and their only apprehension is whether the scheme as at present proposed would prove sufficiently attractive to apprentices to resume their period of training in cases where that period would be of long duration.

Subject to this comment, this Department are in general agreement with the Ministry of Labour proposals.
