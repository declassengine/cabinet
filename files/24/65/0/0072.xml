and in loading to a complete settlement of the dispute.

Only a very small proportion of the mills have as yet started work for the season. This is largely due to the lateness of the harvest, and only to a limited extent to the refusal of scutchers to start work. Reports still indicate that scutching yields are poor.

The Committee of Inquiry appointed by the Vice-President of the Department to inquire into the question of fixing charges for soutching flax and tow have arranged to hold sittings at Belfast, Coleraine, Strabane, Clones and Armagh during the week ending 19th October.

Flaxseed (Ireland) Order, 1918.

The number of cases of breaches of this Order reported to date is 310.

DRAINAGE OF AGRICULTURAL LAND.

The work being done in connection with the Department&apos;s Drainage Scheme under Regulation 2.M. of the Defence of the Realm Regulations consists chiefly in requiring land-holders to cleanse the channels and repair the banks of streams and drains adjoining their land, where the neglect to do so causes the flooding of agricultural land. Since the inception of the work 885 applications have been received by the department, and in 300 of these cases notices have been served requiring the riparian owners concerned to carry out certain specified work. Many of the cases brought before the Department did not come within the limited powers conferred by the Regulation, or were otherwise unsuitable to the purposes of the drainage Scheme, while there are upwards of 250 applications as yet undealt with, and owing to present heavy pressure of work, these must be postponed until next Spring.

In very few of the instances in which Notices have been served has the work been carried out within a reasonable time, and repeated inspections and pressure have been found necessary before effective work could be secured. A large number of defaulters have been prosecuted, and in some of the cases convictions have been obtained, but the smallness of the fines imposed and the attitude of magistrates generally towards such matters, add greatly to the apartment&apos;s difficulties in enforcing the requirements of the Scheme.

In a few larger cases which go beyond the terms of the Regulation, the Department have provided engineering advice and are endeavouring to bring about co-operation amongst the persons whose lands are effected by flooding.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from 24th to 30th ultime, inclusive, 145 applications for licences to slaughter or export heifers and 250 applications for licences to export store heifers, were received. Seventy-five applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks were also received.

For the purpose indicated in last week&apos;s Statement the Department have issued an Order entitled The Maintenance of Live Stock (Ireland) (Milch Cows) Temporary Order, 1918, prohibiting the export of milch cows from Ireland, from 1st October, save under licence. Thirty application for licences to export milch cows have so far been received.
