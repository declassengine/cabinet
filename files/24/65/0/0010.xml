\ DocumeiIs the Propei1Jf/&apos; *ty.&apos;s Governm*Circulated by the Secretary of State for India,37IXINDIAN  REFORMS.Wo, have now had debates in both Houses of Parliament on this question, and I should like again to invite the attention of the War Cabinet to it.i do not in the least over-rate or misvalue the general atmosphere of these debates. It so often occurs that a general appreciation of what one wants to do is coupled with reservations on what the critics call details, but which do amount to questions of principle.Nevertheless, it can well be said that the overwhelming; majority of those who took part in the discussions in both Houses are in accord with the policy of the Government&apos; as announced on 20th August last, and sympathetic to the main principles of the Report which the Viceroy and 1 submitted to the Cabinet. I might have said that all those who took part in the debates in both. I louses approve the policy of the 20th August, but one or two of those who assert that they are in accord with it show obviously that they are not really in accord with it in all its provisions.I venture now to submit that the Government must, take steps to prepare for some further action on its part. The policy of the 20th August was to be carried out &quot;as soon as possible,&quot; and although. I have no wish whatever to force a decision, yet I cannot help thinking that the whole cause, and therefore the policy to which they are committed, will suffer unless steps are taken towards progress in the near future.The two Committees, one to deal with Franchise and the other to deal with the separation of Reserved and Transferred Subjects, are now to be appointed, and in accordance with the Prime Ministers instructions we are in the India Office drafting a Bill and regulations and preparing memoranda on outstanding points.I would beg the Cabinet to make up its mind that after the Recess, when in all probability this material will be ready, it will appoint a Committee of the Cabinet to draft a Bill which shall contain the proposals they intend to lay before the Houses of Parliament.I would also plead that this Committee should be instructed to prepare this 13111 on the assumption that the Cabinet accepts the four principles upon which our recommendations were based, and which are printed in italics in the Report: &quot;(1) There should be, as far as possible, complete popular control in local bodies, and the largest possible independence for them of outside control.&quot; .&quot; (2) The provinces are the domain in which the earlier steps towards the progressive realisation of responsible government should be taken. Some measure of responsibility should be given at once, and our aim. is to give complete, responsibility as soon as conditions permit. This involves at once giving the provinces the largest measure of independence, legis-lative, administrative, and financial, of the Government of India which is compatible with the due discharge of the latter of its own respon-sibilities.&quot;&quot;(3) The Government of India must remain wholly responsible to Parliament, and saving such responsibility, its authority in essential matters must remain indisputable, pending experience of the effect of the changes now to be introduced in the provinces. . In the meantime the Indian Legis-lative Council should be enlarged and made more representative and its opportunities of influencing Government increased.&quot;&quot; (4) In proportion as the foregoing changes take effect, the control of Parlia-rnent and the Secretary of State over the Government of India and provincial Governments must be relaxed.&quot;Perhaps I may say a word further in comment upon the debates. Although it is undoubtedly true that the two Committees are necessary as a step towards the completion of our scheme, and although it is undoubtedly true that a Statute cannot be passed until the Committees have reported, and, indeed, without the third Committee suggested in the Report, yet it is not true in my &quot;opinion that it isSS651  45  9/18
impossible to proeeed with the preparation of a Bill until their reports are available. In each province the reserved and transferred subjects will be variations on one side or the other from the type list printed as an. Appendix to the Report, and the preparation of a Bill can be considered by the Cabinet and a Committee of the Cabinet without waiting for the final decision as to whether agriculture or.excise in the Punjal.) or in Bombay is a reserved or a transferred subject. &quot;     ...Then, too, I do not think that we need delay the Governments decision as to the four principles until the electorate and the franchises have been established. Let it be assumed that the Committee will devise its constituencies and its franchises with a view to getting as broad a franchise and as representative Legislative Councils as it is possible to produce, and let us proceed to draft a Bill on the assumption that their work is not unsatisfactory.. We can modify our conclusions if the difficulties prove insuperable.I think also that it is essential that the Committee on the organisation of the India Office and. its relations to the Government of India, recommended in para-graph 293 of the Report,, should be appointed. It is interesting to notice that Lord Sydenham, who has not much to say in favour of our proposals, favours this recommendation at all events. The Committee would consider (I am not. now. attempting to draft terms of reference) the relations of the Secretary of - State, in Council to the Gjvernment of India, the method of exercising his sanction and veto, the proper distribution of the.cost of the India Office between the British and Indian tax-payer, the best method of recruiting the personnel of the India Office, and.whether any alterations, and if so, what, should be made in the composition and functions of the Council, of India.If a Cabinet Committee is appointed, it will be my privilege and duty to submit to them representations from India and from this country, and we shall be satisfied in knowing that we are getting on with the formulation of a Government measure. In due course this measure would be presented next year to Parliament, and then I think, after second reading, should be submitted to a Joint Committee of both Houses, as I understand Lord Selborne to suggest, with power to take evidence. It has been suggested as an alternative that our Report should be submitted now: to such a Joint Committee. This is a course of action to which I could not assent, and it would amount to the rejection by my colleagues of the work which we did in India, ft&apos; would, in my opinion, be very damaging to the prestige of-the Viceroy, and it would constitute a very novel departure from the ordinary procedure when ministers are considering recommendations and proposals of one of their number. Moreover, it would invite a Committee of both Houses sitting in England, without the advantages of daily discussions and interviews in India, to do over again the. work with which we were entrusted last winter. I say nothing about the disastrous effect upon Indian public opinion and the fact that this would be followed by a protracted Committee Stage upon the Bill when it was eventually produced.E. S. M.26th September 1918.
