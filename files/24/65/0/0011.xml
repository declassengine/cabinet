S 3 C U I,WAR CABINET..TJIB, \YAOES QUESTION, tomOf by Kr*G.H . Barnes,(Previous papers, 0.T,5706it 574Q, md 5761)The circulation of the above p*psr3 by the Committee on Production, ministry of Labour, and Ministry of Shipping respectively, prompts me to offer the following observation! on the wages problem :**1.     I think it cannot be too strongly emphasised that the Committee on Production has. dacharcod its onerous duties duri&amp;K the lest years of war in a very efficient manner,, end I think it is matter for regret that when the body w*i set up,, it w*3 not m-ade obligatory on nil trades to oome to it.   I think it is fl&amp;a-q no less regrettable that Departments, in negotiating in resp-ect to wages, have frequently gone beyond the limits of the Com-Bjlfct.ee on Production, and have therefore put that body in a false position and lessened its influence with the wage earners.2.     If a start had been made three or four years ago on the American plan outlined by Sir leo Chiozza Honey, then probably a ere^t deal of unrest would hive been avoided.   But I doubt if the game is now worth the candle.     The L^ritime Board is now dealing with a l^rge body of men - the Board of Trade with even l*iger bodie3.     I should leave them, subject however to the proviso that all their settlements should be recorded by the ministry of Labour, and that they should be&apos;within the limits prescribed by the: Ministry of Labour, .3,     In the memo. (G.T.5740) by the kinistry of Labour, &apos;i* point is raised in regard to the profits of capital,     I think it is quite true that that point has been a very important one in producing the frame if mind we find Labour in to-day,   it is true that 80^ of excess profit has been taken; but it is ^Iio true that the remaining 20% h-as in many cases yielded large profit to employers of labour, especially in shipbuilding, and these are constantly talked about by the workmen and incessantly dinned into, their ears by those with ulterior motives.     The time and line system may have been a necessity.   I don&apos;t know.     But the impres-sion is very general that it has been greatly abused, and that employers of labour h^ve had little desire to keep wages or costs down to a reasonable level.        A statement on the part of the Government of its intention to limit profits on pre-war basi3 would, I believe, do much to bring peace,   E ven if it didn&apos;t, the fact of the Government deciding to so limit profits, would strengthen our hands in dealing with insurgent labour,4,      I am inclined to think however, that the time for set--ting up new machinery to deal with wages questions has gone, and that great bodies of workmen, having been accustomed to dealing direct with specific Departments, or with special.boards, such as the Lnritime Board, will not now be disposed to accept compulsory arbitration by any supreme authority.     The Ministry of Labour, however, is the -authority duly sot up to de^l with Labour; and even if we cannot get uniformity or unity in administration, we ijfdglit at least set the various Departments to report ind -*ct in accordance with the C ommittee on Production&apos;s findings.     This is in accord with the Cabinet decision of last January, (l/ar Cabinet 317 Linute 1.) which lays down that &quot;&apos;11 applications for/increase
increase in wages should be referred for decision to the Ministry of labour, who may refer them to the Committee on Production; and that the Ministry of Labour should have discretion to ask the Departments concerned to carry on any necessary negotiations, but the final decision in all cases to rest with the Minister.

5. This preserves the Ministry of Labour as a supreme authority, but at the same time preserves the existing practice of the Departments dealing direct with Labour, subject to conditions laid down. Those conditions no doubt would be, that any increase given by the Departments must be within tho limits of increases already given by the Committee on Production, so as to leave the latter body to lend rather than follow, departmental decisions or bargains.

6. The root difficulties about wages are really nil traceable to the early days of the war, when - with the best of possible intentions - it was decided to fix piece work prices for the women and specially trained now labour coming into the munitions industri?. In consequence of simplification and division of processes, that l? to abnormal wages being earned by the women and unskilled and specially trained labour, and the setting up of a new relation between th? labour and other labour. The skilled workman supervising the new labour found his wages less thus those of the people he superintend. The rural worker found his wages less than those,of his daughter. The sailor ditto, and so on.

7. In course of time however, and as the rssult of very gr? trouble, the relative position has gradually been improved, so that now the relation of the skilled workers&apos; wages, and also the wages ? railway workers, miners, and other bodies of men engaged in staple industries, are fairly well adjusted to the wages of the women and ?  the unskilled workers.

8. The railway industry has now got 120% on the pre-war wage? and, of course, the low-paid workers in the railway service are gett? as much as three times the pre-war wage. The same applies to the engineering, shipbuilding, and transport industries are getting though perhaps to ? lessen? degree; but there again, large sections of the engineering, shipbuil?ing, and transport industries are getting nearly, if not quite, thr? times as large a wage as in pre-war days.

9. The time has come therefore, for stabilising the relationships on the present basis, and I think that a bold statement should be made by the Government, intimating their determination to mainta? such relationships, - that is to say, that the agreement made withthe railwy workers last week, should be somehow established over th? whole field of industry.

10. There still remains the question of sectional increased, of wages by individual employers. This is a very disturbing element. The variation in pay in certain places has caused a great deal of trouble. The Hotchkiss firm it Coventry, for instance, has paid ? more than firms in the same district, with the result that Hotchkiss has been a magnet drawing skilled men away from other workshops. It has been suggested that some arrangements might be made whereby a majority rate should be fixed for a district, and that employers of labour should be penalised for going much beyond that rate. I don&apos;t pledge myself to this. It would senm to imply setting up complicated local machinery, but it is worth considering.
