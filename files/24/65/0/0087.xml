Confidential.254LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES. Mf (2nd October 1918.)I circulate the following notes, which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions, on the labour position in munitionStatistics for Week ending the 25th September.During the week ending the 25th September, only 9,629 days were lost through strikes by munition workers.* This shows a considerable improvement on the previous week, when 16,540 days were lost; in the majority ol cases the strikes were small, lasting only one or two days. The greatest loss of time was in the North-Western area, where a total of 5,415 days was lost; the largest strike was in the Liverpool district, where 4,800 days were lost by 800 moulders.A disturbing factor in the industrial situation, which for a long time has not only produced labour unrest, but has also prejudiced output, has been the opposition to&apos; dilution manifested in certain industries or in certain districts. In the aircraft industry, which has also been perturbed by the controversy on payment by results,! opposition to the employment of women woodworkers ha3 been, and still is, persistent, though its practical consequences have diminished in importance with the diminished urgency of the demand for output in this class of work. In the moulding industry, the opposition of the local branches of the unions is persistent in every part of the country; not a week passes without instances of their recalcitrancy being reported. In engineering, however, it is possible to note an&quot; important step in the right direction. At Manchester, a resolution of the District Committee of the A.S.E. last July placed a positive embargo on further dilution. Under pressure from the Ministry of Munitions, supported by the influence of the central executive of the A.S.E., the July resolution has now been rescinded by the District Committee acting with the allied trade unions. The consequences of this local embargo were serious in character. At the establish-ment of Messrs. Beyer, Peacock &amp; Co., Ltd., an additional gun-shop was paralysed for the time being, while at the Openshaw works of Messrs. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd., 124 machines on the day shift and 200 on the night shift have been standing idle in the light gun and sight department alone, owing to the refusal of the men to set up tools for women dilutees. Messrs. Belsize Motors, Ltd., Manchester, were unable to obtain setters-up for women on shell work, and this brought them to a point where it was no longer possible to run one of their shops. They proposed to close it, and explained fully to the men&apos;s representatives the position which would arise. About 500 employees would have had to be discharged, of whom about 100 were skilled men. This explanation, and the issue of Mr. Justice McCardie&apos;s Committee of Inquiry&apos;s report, were probably main factors in inducing the Manchester A.S.E. to withdraw their opposition to further dilution.Even where opposition to dilution is not so stubborn or so systematically organised as in the instances mentioned, any substantially new development is almost certain to encounter delays arising from reluctance or hostility which are only to be overcome by patience in remonstrance and explanation. The introduction of female labour into gas works has begun recently, and last week it led to a strike at Birmingham contrary to the advice of the local trade union officers.. Here, however,* For the purpose of these statistics munition workers are taken to include all classes of workers in respect of whom the Ministry of Munitions would intervene in the event of a strike (a) in the munition industries proper (metals, chemicals, and rubber) ; and (6) iu certain auxiliary industries, e.g,, iron ore mining, brick making, timber sawing, &quot; certified &quot; gas and electricity undertakings, &amp;c.t See these Notes for the 26th Juue, p. 2. a  (33)6640-1   Pk 50   125 10/18  E&amp;Sindustries.WINSTON S.

2the men were brought, after no long delay, to a realisation of their duty, and eventually behaved handsomely in the matter, apologising for their conduct, and offering to do what they could to make the new departure a success. The opposition that is encountered proceeds generally, not from the central executives of the unions,&apos; but from the local branches acting contrary to the advice issuing to them officially from their headquarters. This local independence of action has the practical consequence of obliging the Ministry to fight the battle of dilution over and over again in the different districts of the country. There is good reason to believe that this attitude is attributable in a marked degree to a feeling that the skill of craftsmen recruited for the army, even in technical units, is not being utilised, and that such men would be better employed upon munitions, thus minimising the necessity for dilution. It is probable alsg that skilled workmen think they foresee the approach&quot; of the time when they will be demanding the restoration of their pre-war privileges, and that they are unwilling at this stage to increase the. difficulties they expect to encounter by permitting further extensions of dilution.A centre-point of agitation has for a long time past been the Electrical Trades Union. The work of its members is essential to many other industries, and thus their influence can make itself felt at multitudinous points in the world of labour. On the other hand, important as these workers are in the production of munitions, their numbers are comparatively small, and this, combined with the fact that their conditions of work can easily be supervised by their officials, has resulted in a high degree of organisation and cohesion. Their professional pride, their belief in the indispensable character of their services, their fear of competition, and the personal qualities of their officials, have led to much systematic activity, both in securing high wages and favourable conditions for themselves, and in taking important steps, in London at least, to forestall competition by unskilled labour by forming joint committees with the general labour unions. They have been prominent in resisting the man-power proposals and dilution, in opposing the employment of non-unionists, in raising the apprenticeship question, and in producing on many other topics an atmosphere of unrest. Their weakest point has been the fact that, in the event of a strike, the electrical work at generating stations and other establishments can be carried on with the aid of inexperienced labour under the supervision of a few experts ; and, in order to minimise this possibility, there has of late been a movement among the electricians to compel foremen and clerical assistants to enter their Union. A, few weeks ago an attempt of this kind produced a strike at Liverpool which lasted over a fortnight. It remains to add that the possibilities of the whole situation, so far as the electricians are concerned, have been carefully explored during the last few i aonths, and that preparations have now been made which, it is believed, will be effective to protect the national interest should any serious action be taken by this Union.
