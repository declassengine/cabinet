Activity increased on the 16th, but except on the Front between the La Basse Canal and the Arras-cambrai Road (where the enemy is evidently still apprehensive) has been generally moderate considering the operations in progress.Bombing;.   Bombing is still concentrated on Forward Areas of the feattie Front, possibly owing to unfavourable weather conditions.
