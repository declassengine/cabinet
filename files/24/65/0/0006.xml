Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.

G.T.5806

FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 25th September, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production, in Ireland.

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Thirty-seven applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to date, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£78,092.

PROGRESS OF CROPS.

Owing to very heavy rains, harvesting and tillage operations were at a standstill in many parts of the country during the greater part of the week. From all districts, reports were received of the damage to grain and other crops. In low lying districts, flooding occurred in a number of cases. Even on high ground, grain in the &apos;stock&apos; showed a tendency to sprout, although when harvested in carefully made and headed stocks loss injury has been caused. Where the orop has not been out, much of it has beoe lodged and twisted, which will necessitate outting with a scythe. Some farmers have been able to cart grain during the fine intervals, but it is feared that very serious damage will result to grain crops generally, unless there is an immediate improvement in the weather. The condition of the potato crop is on the whole still good. Pasture is abundant, and cattle are generally in good condition.

The sowing of catch crops has been checked by the unfavourable weather, but reports as to the progress made by early sown crops of this description are very satisfactory. Ploughing the stubble for winter wheat has oommenced in early districts, and arrangements are being made for an additional acreage under this crop. Flax has been badly damaged in some places, and the portion retained for seed has been seriously injured.

FLAX.

Owing to the continuance of wet weather during the past week, it is now feared that the seed of about one-half of the flax reserved for seed will be damaged to an extent to render it unsuitable for sowing purposes.

25/9/18.
Most of the general flax crop has now been retted, but a  large proportion of the retted straw still remains in the fields, and has suffered considerable damage from the continuous rainfall.

The reports received by the Department indicate that the yields of flax of the 1918 crop already scutched are on the whole very poor, and that on an average they will not be higher than those obtained in the previous season.

The dissatisfaction among the scutchers still continues. The Department are sending a copy of the Wages Award of the Arbitration Court set up by the Ministry of Labour to every mill-owner, and are endeavouring to ascertain the legal position of the different parties involved in the disputes. If this can be clearly determined, the Department propose to interview the more important Union leaders and explain the position to them with a view to getting them to induce the scutchers to start work on the terms of the Arbitration Court&apos;s Award. It nay be mentioned that even had no more dissatisfaction arisen there would not have been at this date ? many more mills started than are working at present.

Millowners Charges for Scutching: The preliminary meeting of the Committee of Inquiry on this matter will be held on the 27th instant.

The number of cases of breaches Of the Flax? (Ireland) Order reported to date is 277.

TRANSIT OF FARMING REQUISITES.

The work of the Department&apos;s Transit Branch continued to be carried cut on the usual lines. Representations were received during the past week as to the conveyance of consignments of threshing and agricultural machinery, and seed, and the necessary action was taken in each case.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from 17th to 23rd instant, inclusive, 140 applications for licences to slaughter or export ? and 280 applications for licences to export store heifers, were received. Seventy-three applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks were also received.

With a view to maintaining the breeding stock of cattle in the country at a proper level, th Department, as a temporary measure, are prohibiting the export of miloh cows from Ireland from 1st October, save under licence.
