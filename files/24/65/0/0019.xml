(STRIKE SITUATION.CANCELLATION OF PROTECTION ^RTIEICATES.TIP? MINUTES of the Second M&amp;crting -o*f *tfrifi -OmmiTti^uwore approved as -mended..SIR HERBERT WALKER said, that the position to-day was very much hotter, that most of the men in South Wales wore hack at work,&apos; and. that in certain cases the mines and shipping wore working,     At Bristol, which was one of the worst&apos; suots,&apos; nearly all the men were, hack and the same could, he said of Liverpool, while &amp;z Manchester, Chester, Bailor, Preston and Cro^o, all tho men had re-turned to work.   Generally speaking it.might he said that outside London tho men werr all coming hack.   In London at Willesdon and Old Oak, the men were returning hut they were still on strike at Bow and. Devon Road- and on the Great Eastern Railway while the position was the worst 01 all on the South Western Railway,&apos;   .A Meeting was held at Nino Elms that mornimr at which the men passed atrouble had arisen, the men there refusing even to work, the Ambulance trains.   Sir Eerhert expressed the opinion that it could he considered that the extreme danger was now over,     The strikers had &quot;been quiet everywhere and , military assistance had only &quot;been called upon at Stratford,SIR ALBERT STANLEY informed the Committee that since the meeting held tho -previous afternoon, ho had had a talk on the totophone with Mr. Thomas-and Mr. Bromley, and in. view of Mr. Thomas11 o-ertain statement that the men in South Wales would return to work,, it had &quot;been decided tc refrain from issuing the notices about the Protection Certificates.     Mr, Thomas had asked that a statement should he issued to the Press to.tho effect that in response to an appeal from him the Government had decided . that there should&quot;he no victimisation, and that an appeal should he made to the men to return to work.   This request of Mr. Thomas1 had heen considered, hat it had been decided that such an announcement would serve no good purpose and might be considered as a sign of weakness. From information which had boen received it was clear that the reception given go tho soldiers who had heen moved to South Wales had. been a very warm one,     The conduct of the soldiers had soon very helpful indeed.&apos; and Sir Albert desired to expvess u,;.s&apos;/thanks to the Army for the tactful manner in which a difficult situation had been dealt with.The question now outstanding was whether the Committee proposed to issue the notice cancelling the -Protect.] on Ceii ifi calos, and giving a limit Q-&amp; time to tho strikers to return to w0rk.SIR AUCKLAND GEaib 0&apos;in reply-to a question whether the Government were likely to issuea general notice with regard to the cancellation of Protection Certificates of men.on strike, said that that was not tho present   intention   *f   the Government, but it was proposed, after the present strikes had been settled, given a period of comparative industrial peace, that a notice should be issued of the intentions of the Government. At the present tine, the strikes in existence were being dealt with separately, and a notice had justbeen
been completed dealing with the stride of Shipwrights on the Clyde, this notice called up all men of the, . .&apos; proclaimed ages who did not return to woik by Mondaynext, find was on the mm lines as the draft notioe which had been submitted to the Committee on the I previous day. It was proposed, if tho Prime Miniatff agreed, that this,notioe to mon on the Clydo should be issued to-night and Sir A* (Jeddes expressed eome doubt as to whether in issuing one notice it would not be advisable to issue both at the same time.,, , ;    SIR ESHBE&amp;iP WAbKSB said that ho- thought it .would bo preferable to- defer any action in this matter for a further PA hours. - H0 advised giving %ho- men every opportunity of returning to work, but if they were nnt back by to-morrow, he was prepared to agree to the issue of a notioe to the, effect that all men who had not returned to work by Monday morning should lose theis Protection Certificates *M bqreoruitcd in the Army.    The Railway Bxe6utive Were fTilly prepared that this notice should be carried Into tall effect.Sir Herbert also pointed out that the strikers on the Clyde had been out for 10 d^s, whereas the Railways had only been out for throe *MR. FfiANK ?OTTKR in agreeing with Sir Herbert falker said that the fact that tho Old Oax men and the Willesden men were coming back was the most hopeful sign after the return of the men in South Wales *      There wero still two or three Provincial places with men on strike, but other places like P rt Talbot, were in full work, and he was strongly of opinion that the strike would not spread in South Wales, now.    Unless all indications were misleading It could be hoped that the position in 24 hours time wouil be fairly satisfactory, and if the notices -were issued to-night some men might&apos; regard it as &amp; challenge, and refuse to come back when they otherwise would have.THIS COMMITTEE decided..-That the issue of the notice cancelling protection Certificates should be deferred until the following day in view of the more satisfactory news received on tho strike situation, but that if it was considered necessary in tho circumstances to Issue the notice on the follow!ng clay, every railwayman who was on strike on Monday next should bo recruited into the Army without exception.4. STOPPAGE OF TED ADJUTANT GMStlAl said that men coming on leaviLEAVE FOE        had been sent to their homes, but that he had SOEDtSBS not heard If the return Of men to France had ^OVERSEAS * been interfered with,    Field-Marshal Sir DouglasEaig was more affected by the non-return of men to France,GW-IML mODOHOGH asked that the Committee should express an opinion as to whether, from the point of view of Propaganda, leave from Frsnoe should not be stonned.
SIR HERBERT WALKER explained that the bulk of the men on leave generally could get back by the S.E.&apos;R.,,&apos; which had not been affected. 1   He had not heard of any trouble in this respect, but if any difficulty did arise in the case of men returning from the Worth, this could be easily adjusted.,SIR ALBERT STANLEY said that it would be difficult to justify a stoppage of leave until the Committee had decided to cancel the Protection Certificates, as it would look as if the Government was pressing forward the sentimental point . &apos; of view before taking the more logical si^epTHE COMMITTEE decidedThat the question of the stoppage of leave for soldiers, overseas should be deferred until the following day..Whitehall Gardens * S;W.1. 26th September 1918. r  -/
