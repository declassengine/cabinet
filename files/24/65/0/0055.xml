toNo. 134ALLIED MARITIME TRANSPORT COUNCIL.General Report for Six Months, 15th March to 14th September 1918.Six months have now elapsed since, the first meeting of the Council, and it may be well to supplement the ordinary Monthly Reports of action by a general summary covering the whole period and stating (a) the development of the Councils organisa-tion and Associated Bodies ; (b) the action&apos; taken by the Council and the Executive, and other important events of interest to the Council, including not only action taken by the Council itself, but also arrangements made direct between the Shipping Authorities of the several countries.16th September 1918.I. Development of Councils Organisations and other Allied Bodies.The Executive of the Council (The Allied Maritime Transport Executive) has now developed into a large organisation in Lancaster House. The total staff working there now numbers about 300 and is organised as follows :  (a) 4. National Divisions There are four National Divisions French, Italian, American, and British.(&amp;) International Committees (1) Executive; (2) Tonnage ; (3) Imports, questions of policy being decided through this international machinery of Committees and inter-national points of view adjusted.(c) &quot;Non-National&quot; Secretariat Members of this Secretariat are of different nationalities, but on entering the Secretariat divest themselves of any national point of view. The duty of the Secretariat is to give executive and administrative effect to the policy decided upon by the Council and by the International Committees.(d) Shipping Intelligence Section The Shipping Intelligence Section, which has been transferred from the Ministry of Shipping, keeps a continuous record of the position and employment of all Ocean-going vessels of every nationality.Programme Committees have now been established to cover the whole range of imported commodities, separate Committees being formed for : 1. Wool. 2. Cotton,3. Hides and Leather. 4. Tobacco. 5. Paper. 0. Timber. 7. Petroleum.8. Flax, Hemp, and Jute. i9. Coal and Coke.0  (33) AS 6306   Pk 20  250  9/18   B &amp; SJ. A. Saltee.II. Associated Allied Bodies; Programme Committees.
In addition, a Food Council has been established co-ordinating the work of Executives or Committees for-10. Cereals,11. Oil Seeds,12. Sugar,13. Meats and Fats,and a Munitions Council with Sab-Committees for 14. Nitrates. .....15. Aircraft. 16. Chemicals. 17. Explosives. 18. Non-Ferrous Metals. &quot; 19. Mechanical Transport.&apos; ,  ..20. Steel..      . -These bodies have prepared provisional programmes, and are engaged in the continuous work of adjusting these programmes as the situation changes, and also in arranging with the Transport Council for their execution., Italian Goal.The first problem dealt with by the Council was that of Italian Coal. Last year the Allies accepted no collective responsibility for Italian coal, and except for 50,000 tons a month provided by Great Britain, Italy was responsible for arranging her own imports with her own vessels and such British vessels as she could charter.Submarine losses and the cereal crisis in Italy at the end of the year which caused the diversion of a considerable number of the Italian colliers-to the Wheat Service, resulted in a very serious coal crisis. Her imports throughout the year only averaged about 440,000 tons a month and in the winter months about 350,000 tons a month. By the early part of this year her stocks had been exhausted and her minimum requirements Avere between 200,000 and 300,000 tons a month above her imports. &apos; ,        :&quot;. -After careful examination 600,000 tons a month was agreed to be her minimum requirement, and arrangements were made for 350,000 tons (afterwards reduced in practice to about 250,000 tons) to be supplied by French Mines, the remainder being sent from England via Blaye or by the long route via Gibraltar. This &apos; arrangement made it possible to supply more coal to Italy without a corresponding increase in tonnage, and as compared&apos;with her average imports of about 400,000 tons a month for the preceding 12 months, there has been, despatched to Italy during the last six months an average of about 600,000 tons a month. in addition to the constitution of a special Military reserve of 150,000 tons. The Italian coal position, which Was in a desperate position in March, has therefore been put&quot; in a substantially more satisfactory condition. -     ....... . Other Italian Services. &apos;      &quot;&quot;&apos;   &apos;(a) Munitions. The Italian Munition position, particularly after, the great enemy captures at Caporetto, was as serious as her coal position. The Allies had no complete information of her munition requirements, and had assumed no collective responsibility. A review of the position early in this year, showed the absolute necessity for further imports of munitions, and large shipments were made both from the United Kingdom and from America. The additional assistance given both in steel, general munitions, and nitrates has given very substantial relief to the situation, though the problem cannot yet be considered to be fully solved and is still engaging the attention of the Munitions Council.   : ......       -(b) Food. Italy&apos;s deficiencies in food, particularly in cereals, were-no less serious, and in the early months of this year Italy was very near such4 depletion of stocks as would have meant local starvation on a large scale. Before the end of the cereal year the position had been remedied in the case of cereals, the diversion of - British vessels being arranged in accordance with an agreed re-partition programme designed to equalize the positions of Great Britain, France, and Italy. Arrangements have now been made to apply similar arrangements to other.foods besides cereals!-(c) Raw Materials. Italian requirements of raw materials amount&quot; to aboutSl/30th of her total requirements.   Less progress has been made in dealing with this class of
requirements as the commodities essential for the war, coal, munitions, and food, were naturally given the preference, and the Italian position in some cases, e.g,, wool, has been serious. Emergency measures are being taken to relieve the position, but it has been less fully dealt with than coal, food, or munitions.French Coal.Until the middle of March the French coal programme had been entirely a problem of shipping, as there was always more coal available for export than ships to take it. Unfortunately the German advance which by reducing the output of the Pas de Calais mines increased France&apos;s requirements, was accompanied by a serious shortage of coal in the United Kingdom, due mainly to the recruiting of miners for the Army. France has throughout the summer been receiving less coal than she needed in order to meet both current requirements and to form a reserve for the winter. The total importa-tions from England to France have been during the live months April-August 7,168,000 tons or an average of 1,433,600 tons per month, against a provisional programme of 1,740,000 tons a month.- So far as shipping, however, is concerned (for which alone the Council is responsible) every possible assistance has been given. Since March 21st ships have been found to lift every ton of coal which could be provided at the English mines and -^^fe^eHo tljLe French ports.&apos;;     ; &apos; .&apos;       &apos; French Services.(a) Munitions.Such arrangements as have been necessary have been made to supplement French imports of nitrates and general munitions, and though there is a deficiency in such articles as railway materials and wagons, it has not in the main been due to shipping, and the position of French munitions while in some difficulty, like all other supply services, has not been critical.. (b) Food. As in the case of Italy, arrangements have been made to secure imports of cereals on the basis of equality by the end of the cereal year, and similar arrangements are now being applied to other classes of food.(c) Raw Materials. The same general remarks apply as in the case of Italy, i.e., the position has been less completely met, a preference having been given to food and munitions.Belgian Relief.Until the spring of this year, the Belgian Relief Commission secured transport partly by the use of Belgian vessels and partly by chartering neutral vessels. The control of neutral ships by America and Great Britain had, however, become so complete by April as to make it impossible for the Commission to obtain vessels in this way. The result was the Belgian Relief was in a very serious condition, neither any one Ally nor the Allies collectively having assumed any responsibility for the provision of tonnage which could not in fact be secured without them. The Council decided to accept the direct responsibility for the provision of the necessary tonnage and arrangements were subsequently made by the Executive for sharing responsibility equally between America and Great Britain. Since that date this arrangement has been put into execution satisfactorily and the Belgian Relief Programme fully supplied.Allocation of Pool Neutral Tonnage.A general working plan for the allocation of the block of neutral tonnage (amounting ultimately to about 750,000 tons deadweight) coming under the direction of the Council has been in operation since May, the vessels being by common consent employed in carrying coal for France and Italy, and cereals for the Allies, pending the agreement of the programmes of requirements which may necessitate adjustment over a wider range of services. The number of vessels that have been allocated in the Pool is 205, and the total tonnage now operating in the Pool is 453,856 tons deadweight.American Military Programme.Since the beginning of March, the most important factor in the Allied tonnage position has been the American Military Programme with its attendant problem of supply, the requirements of which have absorbed all excess of American building
over losses, besides imposing a demand upon British, shipping equivalent to a loss of 200-250,000 tons of food and munition imports a month. Up till the end of August 1,628,223 American soldiers have been conveyed to Europe, of whom about 836,906 have been carried in British vessels, 736,979 in American and French vessels, and 54,338 in Italian vessels.Note on General Tonnage Position.(1) In the period covered by this report the increase in American building has brought allied and world building above allied and world losses.Apart from American building, however, allied and world losses have still been largely in excess of building, and, as on the most favourable computation, the excess of American building over losses is less than the increased demands on tonnage made by the American Army, the tonnage available for the rest of the world, and, in particular, for the EuropeanAllies, is smaller, and is still diminishing.(2) During the first -eigefc months of the year the American building exceeded losses by about l  million tons d w. During the same period the losses of the European Allies and of the world, excluding America, exceeded building by about the same amoimt; world tonnage remaining approximately the same at the end as at the beginning of the period. -In the later months the net gain of America has been greater than the net loss of the rest of the world. *d uirjj, a ^L \ ^iLix      d w .(3) The European Allies start the cereal year, September 1918, with about 2,000,000 tons d.w. less for their needs than they had a year ago. This (after allow-ance for certain favourable factors, such as the prospect of an increased proportion of importations from the near source of the N. Atlantic) is estimated to necessitate reduction of imports by about 3 million tons. The Food Councils programme, how-ever, asks for an increase of 4^- million tons; the Munition CounciVs programme (not yet received) is understood to be contemplating an increase by several millions ; and America is asking for assistance in her supply programme. The need for drastic restriction is therefore imperative, and supply tonnage being the limiting factor for the American Army, it is estimated that each 5,000 tons of imports saved will enable about 1,000 additional American soldiers to be maintained in and therefore sent to, France.
