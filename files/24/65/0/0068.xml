0ir- th- Property o1Secret.WAR ciBira.203PIVOTAL   MM.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.At their meeting on the 2let August 1918 (War Cabinet 462, Minute 7) the flar Cabinet decided that tho ouestion of making arrangements for the release before general demobilization of &quot;pivotal&quot; men in industry and oommerce should be deferred for three montho.It is not olear what exactly is tho effect of the War Cabinet*s decision but tho main reason for the delay thoy have imposed appears to be the possibility that tho necessary action night tend to produce a poaoe atmosphere.    It.ie submitted that this danger could only arise If action were carried to the point of selecting men by name to be releasod on demobilisation (see General Smuts4a speech at tho War Cabinet), and that such preliminaries as the selection end whore neoossary the sotting up of Central Authori-ties, for the various industries might safely be oontinued, it being clearly stated to the Central Authorities that no steps for the selection of particular men are contemplated at present and of course none should be taken without the authority cf the War Cabinet.    Sub-Committee A of the Labour Resettlement Committee were strongly of opinion that it was necessary to gtvo the longest possible tints for the trades to create their machinery and that they should be efilowed to begin their preparations at once.3?hey pointed out that the subject of the demobilization arrangements was being freely discussed and that it is generally assumed that Bpecial arrangements will be made for &quot;pivotal men. On these grounds they have asked me to bring the matter before :^he War Cabinet with a view to obtaining their sanction to tho trcuXe organisations making the necessary preparations without actually selecting the individual men.    It le emulated that tho whole process of seleotlon may take six months, so that further delay seems very undesirable, unless it ie absolutely unavoidable.(Signed) Gee- H* Roberts.p
