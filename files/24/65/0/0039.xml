i ^\l.------ A \4-0v /Document is the Property ofivl a j e st y *s Gove r n m e nt.)representation of the people act, 1910. dates for second register.aEidORANDUu BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD.The Representation of the People i*ct, 1918, provides for two Rogisters a year, a spring and an autumn rogister.     The spring register which relates to a qualifying period of six months ending oh the 15th January comes into, force on the.15th April and lasts till the 15th,October, the autumn register,.which relates to a qualifying period ending 15th July comes into, force on tho 15th October and lasts till iho following 15&apos;th Aprils - Special dates wore to be pro-scribed for the first rogister and may be fixed for any subsequent register to be prepared during the war and a poriod-of 12 months thoreafter.The first register has been prepared relating to a qualifying period ending 15th April last.     It comes into operation on 1st October noxt arid ate at present arranged,will remain in operation till 15th inarch, 1919.     It is now necessary to make&apos;&quot;provision for tho preparation of the second register.     The preparation of this, though troublesome, will he., a less formidable task than that of the first register.     The officials and the public will both be more familiar with the new qualifications and the procedure than they were when the Apt had only just been passed and the work will be a revision of an existing rogister and not the compilation of entirely fresh lists of names.     Tho printing-vd 11 also be loss laborious.     ;;ut it will be nocessary to have a fairly careful house-to-house canvass in order to got mistakes which may have occurred in connection with the first rogister, corrected, and there is also the possibility that objections and claims by the political agents - which have been extremely few in this country, in connection with tho first register - may be more numerous and impose a greater tax on the Registration Officers in connoction with the revision.
It io suggested that it would bo reasonable in tho circumstances to fix tho qualifying period for the second register as the six months ending on 15th December, 1918, and to make the rogister come into force on 15th April, 1919, the operation of the first register (which at present ends on 15th i.-..aroh) being oxtendod for a month until tho 15th April.jjaval and military voters.     Particulars of the30 voters wore obtained in^v^rTou(3 ways for tho first register.     In a very large number of cases information wab&apos; derived locally concerning them.     In addition by means of cards circulated throughout the Forces and by information given by the ^ooord offices in regard to soldiers serving in diBtant places a great mass of additional information was secured.     It is proposed that, subject to corrections which may be obtained in tho course of tho local Investigations and to the elimination of the names of mon notified as discharged or dead, the names of naval and military voters included in the first rogistor shall bo placed upon the second register.     It may also bo advisable^if the naval and military authorities, agree,,to give to those voters an opportunity,&apos;if they so desire, to notify any Change of qualification, but a repetition of the wholesale circulation of cards seems to bo unnooosoary.Subject to the concurrence-of tho war Cabinet. I should propose to proceed on tho lines indicated above.In tho case of Ireland tho ^ct provides for one register only in a year, viz.- an&apos; autumn register&apos; in respect of a- qualifying; period ending on 15th July and coming into force&apos; on 15th .October;- tSo no question arises&apos; there..    The. Secretary for Scotland agrees with my proposals. -&apos; ( 5 i*&apos; i*      &apos; &apos; 4&apos;  m9 HAiES x^ISKER.* &apos;  &apos;ljOcal Grovernmont board, &apos; .Whitehall.bQth September, 1918,
