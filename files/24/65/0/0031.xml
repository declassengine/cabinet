SECRET&quot;.7GI    INCBE/SFS.5? % I Memorandum by tho minister of National Service.I have read with great interest the recommendations of the Committee on Production,contained in their Memorandum G.T.5706 and the comments of the Minister 5f Munitions and Sir Detid Sh v^ckle ton.The auctioning of&apos; labour which is fit present taking piece has a direct effect upon man-p*;wer ss well as on finance. Not only is working time lost by the movement of labour from one uncompleted job to another, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to concentrate labour upon the most essential con-struetions1 work.These difficulties cannot be solved apart from the question of wages,     I entirely agree that there ought to be one single authority controlling increases in wages.     This principle was, as I understand it, in fact accepted by the &quot;&apos;ar Cabinet at the end of November last when the Cabinet Committee on Labour was established, and was again confirmed when the functions of that Committee as regards wages were transfer-rod to the Ministry of Labour..     It is, In my opinion, essential not only to establish a. single control, but to make that control effective and to prevent such sectional increases in wages as are drawn attention to by Kr* Churchill,     I think, however, that this question cannot be considered apart from the whole principle of time and line contractso     Contracts on this basis present a double danger.     They lead to great increases in the cost of production and also to c sleekening of business initiative.I think that the Admiralty could give interesting figures of the comparative cost of the construction of the identical vessels in different yardsi probably even in different yards in the same ares;    and I have no doubt that the Ministry of Munitions could supply similar examples throughout the munitions field.     The solution from the financial side does not lie simply in a further limitation of excess profits.     Such a limitation dous nothing to discourage inefficient management,I discussed this question with ?.h. Bingham, the Executive Secretary of the Personnel Committee of United States Yter Department on his recent visit.     He Informed me that the United States had experienced similar difficulties In time and line contracts and that they had adopted the following solution:-When a contract is placed on a. time and line basis a maximum figure is fixed.     The contractor receives a given percentage on all expenses up to that maximum figure, but he also receives an increased percentage on any sum which he is able to s;ve short of that figure.     For. example:   Suppose a contract is placed on a time&apos; and line basis with a maximum of  500,000,     The contractor completes the contract at a total cost cf  400*000,     He would receive, say, 10)- on  400,000 and say 15x on the  100,000 which he had not expended.I submit that it is worth considering whether such a principle could not be widely adopted in this country.,Recent uvents have compelled the Government to make an immediate stand on the question of.wages, Temporary industrial trouble will no doubt result; but the winter is the best time to fr.ee this, I feel/ however, that it is most important, once the problem Is taken in hand, that all its aspects should be faced and a complete solution obtained. For this reason I have drawn attention to the : bove considerations.A, C, GEDDES. 28,9,18.
