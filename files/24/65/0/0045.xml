- This Document is the Property of-lis Britannic Majesty&apos;.? Government.)122/5001 formal ttee for Home KfJ*i?J\Apprenticeship interrupted &quot;by War service,I urttsh to submit, the following memorandum which has been prepared on this subject..30/9/18.1*    It would seem that ,two classes of loss are caused both to the State and the individual over this question;-(a) Those who joined the Army before finishing their apprenticeship.(b) ... Those who would have become apprentices but for thegeneral disponsion of the usual conditions,The Draft Outline scheme of the Ministry of Labour is .expressly limited only to the first class, and even so under paragraph 5 of Appendix (a) a man who was in his last year of apprenticeship when called up for service is further limited as to a granti   under this paragraph those who had nearly finished and have since fallen back in skill owing to war service would seem to be placed at a disadvantage - and the longer their service the greater this will be,2,     It is probable however that in many cases by work under the Educational Scheme of the Army this category of apprentices may be enabled to undertake sufficient training to be considered to have completed their apprenticeship:   it is at any rate the category for whom tne Army can do most. The Amy scheme will take into its survey all classes and give them as much instruction ac possible, but it must be remembered that as long as fighting Is in progress,instruction must be limited by:-(a) The dispersal of men of one industry into many units widuly separated from one another, constantly moving and continually changing in personnel,(b) The practical impossibility of erecting in the field apparatus necessary for continuous and adequate vocational training.(c) The difficulty of finding competent instructors&apos;.in the field at any rate formations mu&quot;t t.; a great extent rely upon their own r-sources.3.    There are definitely two periods within which the Army scheme will operate;-(a) During the continuance of hostilities-,(b) Immediately after the suspension of hostilities and during demobilisation.During (a) it is hoped by a judicious grouping of subjects to teach some of the theoretical knowledge which underlies several trades together:   in addition, where the facilities locally available admit practical instruction willbe
be given.    But it ie impossible during (a) to deal exhaustively with the apprenticeship problem.     It is hoped to develop technioal and vocational work so aB to onable students to improve, or at least retain their skill, but thio development must^be dependent upon the locality and the chance of conHnuity.   In certain tradts the employment on which men are engaged as soldiers facilitate further instructs but it must be borne in mind that however skilful a man may &quot;fee made in one part of hie trade, it is difficult in the Army to develop his all-round efficiency in an industry.To view the Army as a whole, therefore,comprehensive technical training cannot be provided during (a).     in some cases the training given may be so complete as to serve as fully the   equivalent of apprenticeship, in others it may be impossible to. give any at all.    It is, however, a part of tho Army scheme that work done should be recorded and also that men should be assisted to pass any certificate, etc. ho can. It will then be for the Joint industrial councils or for other Associations of Employers and Trades Union to decide how far such training as has been given can be accepted by tho industry concerned as the equivalent of apprenticeship.During (b) it is   hoped greatly to extend technical and vocational work, e.g,(1)    By opening apprenticeship classes provided that men who wish to Join them oan be grouped at suitable centres.(2)    By employment under competent instructors in certain classes of industry which are immediately possible in the areas, e.g. (in Prance) bricklaying.4.     It is felt that no adequate substitute for the apprenticeship which has been interrupted or lost can be provided as a whole;   training will depend too largely on the individual circumstances.   All that ca:a be attempted comprehensively is to enable men to carry on cr tc begin their training to a greater or less degree and to endeavour to secure that every man receives to the fullest extent possible recognition for such degree of training as he has been able er willing to work up to.If the Army were tc undertake more than this I am convinced it &apos;7ould only lead to disappointment and discontente(Sd.) Ororell,Colonel, D..u.s*D. (Edn:).
