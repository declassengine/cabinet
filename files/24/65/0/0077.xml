]I!^1^^^^J^!!.J^^^ of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]REPLACEMENT OF MATERIAL USED IN SUPPLIES FOR THEAMERICAN ARMY.I HAVE been approached by various officers of the American Expeditionary Force in connection with the question of replacement from the United States of material used in supplies produced in this country for the American Army.More than a year ago we insisted upon the policy of replacement for three reasons: (1.) At a time when a number of officers were asking for quantities of goods, estimated on a basis which we could not test, we found it useful to insist that these officers should get an assurance of replacement from Washington as some sort of guarantee of urgency.(2.) At that time we were not certain to what extent our own orders would be squeezed out by the competition of the American programme.(3.) The Shipping Controller naturally insisted that we should claim an allocation of an equivalent American tonnage.As regards (1), the urgency of requirements is now much more fully understood both by the American staff and by ourselves, and is examined by Inter-Allied organisations set up for the purpose.As regards (2), we are still apprehensive about our supplies from the United States. But we are compelled to admit that during the last eighteen months we have never, in fact, been denied supplies which have been really urgent, and we must assume that the United States Government will continue to meet us in the same spirit. In fact, they do their utmost to help us, and,in spite of our special counter-claims we are heavily in their debt.As regards tonnage, the Shipping Controller is making bargains with the American Government on much broader lines than the exchange of tens of thousands of tons, and I understand he no longer wishes us to bargain ton for ton as before.In these circumstances, 1 propose to accede to the wishes of the American Army, to waive the question of replacement of specific quantities of material for particular cessions, and to&apos; rely on the .broad principle that we are to help each other to the utmost of oar ability. I shall, however, keep a full account of the material used in the goods supplied to the United States, and shall naturally continue to put these figures before the United States representatives when discussing with them the allocation from the United States of bulk supplies to Great Britain. I am sure this is the wisest course to pursue, and the most likely to secure American assistance. Nothing in the above proposals affects the question of money payments, which are all adjusted in the regular way.I should be glad, however, to have the concurrence of the War Cabinet before definitely informing General Pershing that I am waiving our claim to specific replacement.Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1918.Circulated by the Minister of Munitions.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.October 3,1918.[837]
