the clearance of an area surroundin ? a fortress or in proxjLuity to entrenchment ana even to the dostruction of villages to cover a retreat.On the other hanc piila ;c and the destruction of private property when serving no military and or of protected buildings except durln-;; a bombardment are, they qonsiacr, absolutolv forbidden, while devastation in order to be legiti-mate must be justifiable on the&apos; ground of urgent and imperative military needs and must be confined within the limits of military requirements.It would, in the CouncilAs opinion, be desirable that, in order to avoid if possible the wholesale devastation of the occupied areas in France ana Belgian, His Majesty1s Government should join with the Allied Governments in notifying the German Government that the fullest reparation will be demanded in respect of pillage and any wanton damage or destruction which may be comr.itt.ed by enemy troops..  .&apos;&apos; I am .Sir,Your obedient Sorvant, (Sgd.)
