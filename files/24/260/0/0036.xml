This document is  the  property  of Hia Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, March, 1936SECRET.Corv  No.-42CP. 69  (36).THE CABINETTHE  ARMY AND  AIR FORGE  (ANNUAL)  BILLMEMORANDUMM BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR  WAR    1. I circulate herewith the Army and Air  Force (Annual) Bill.  An explanation   110of the proposed amendments to the Army Act and the Air Force Act is  given  in  the  GeneralMemorandum attached to the Bill.   I do not think that  the  proposals call  for  special   4927attention, except perhaps Clause 5.    2. As  regards Clause 5, in the course  of  the debate on last year&apos;s Annual Billsome misapprehension was displayed regarding the purport and effect of Section 146 ofthe Act, which enacts that no regular army officer shall be nominated or elected (a) as asheriff ; (6) as a mayor, alderman or other office-holder  in any municipal  corporation,though he  may be a member of a county council.   The  Opposition appeared to regard the Section as enabling officers to be County Councillors and  therefore as discriminating.against other ranks ;  whereas the truth is that qualification to serve on County or otherCouncils is conferred by other acts (e.g., the Local Government Act, 1933),and Seclionl46,Army Act,  by not forbidding other ranks to take office, may be regarded as, if anything,legislating against officers.   The Section contains, however, certain anomalies, in that itlegislates against membership of municipal corporations (boroughs and county boroughs)but not against membership of county, district and parish councils, whereas it would seemadvisable not to legislate at all against what may be regarded as the necessary fulfilmentby soldiers  of their duty as citizens, provided that such  duty does not conflict with the prior requirements of military duty.  This  was the view taken by the BlanesburghCommittee  on the Parliamentary, etc.,  candidature of Crown Servants, the unanimousfindings  of  which were  endorsed by the  Cabinet on 8th July,  1925, which  recom-mended that the question of  the municipal candidature of State Servants should be leftto Departmental regulation, subject to  no moral or material interference  with  officialduties.   It is therefore proposed to  remove the statutory  disqualification of officers inregard to  the  holding  of  municipal  office which  Section  146 of the  Army  Actand the  Air Force Act impose,  and to deal with the matter  by  means  of  King&apos;sRegulations.  That portion of  the  Section which disqualifies  officers for appointment as sheriffs  must, however, be retained  because  the acceptance of  office,  if selected,  iscompulsory and  cannot be  avoided by  departmental regulation.   It  is,  however,unnecessary to safeguard other ranks in the same manner, as  eligibility for appointment as sheriffs is confined to landowners.     3. As my colleagues are aware, the Bill must receive the Royal Assent by the  endof April, and it is proposed to take  all the stages in the  House of Commons before the easter x-recess.D. C.THE WAR  OFFICE,     6th March, 1936.(B36/8J 70 3/36 W.O.P. 9315
Army and Air  Force (Annual) Bill.MEMORANDUM.                     CLAUSE 4.    The object of the proposed amendment is to removea technical difficulty which arises where an air force officer is in supreme command in certain places abroad and hasunder him military units as well as air force units.   Insuch a case, if the  senior military officer confirms the finding and sentence of a court-martial for the trial of a soldier, it is not clear that the air force officer command-ing the force as a whole can subsequently exercise thestatutory powers  of commutation or  remission.  Thesame difficulty arises in the converse case of air force units under  a military commander.     The amendment makes it clear that the senior officer(whether naval, military or air force, as  the case may be)can always exercise those powers.                      CLAUSE 5.     Section 146 of  the Army Act provides (inter alia)that regular officers on the active list shall not be eligiblefor appointment as  mayor, alderman or councillor of  amunicipal corporation; but the disqualification does not extend to membership of a  county, district,  or parishcouncil,   nor   does  it  apply  to  soldiers.   The clauseproposes  to remove these anomalies  by repealing  the relevant  part  of s.  146.  The position of officers andsoldiers  in  regard to  candidature  for local government councils will then fall to be dealt with by departmentalregulation.                       CLAUSE  7.     The  present phraseology of ss. 108A (1) and 115 (1) of the Army and Air Force Acts is no  longer applicable to the  air  force, which is now  organised by reference to functions and  not, as the Army still is, by reference to     79-2                 a
Army and Air Force    [26 GEO. 5. &amp;     (Annual).            1 EDW. 8.]geographical areas.  The purpose of the proposed amend -ments is to adapt the two subsections in question to thenew conditions under which the action therein contem-plated would fall to be taken by an officer in command of a branch or of a body of men,  and not of a district.                      CLAUSE &apos; 8.    The proposed amendment makes a retired air forceofficer who is liable to recall for duty subject to the AirForce Act on  the  receipt  of orders of recall and notmerely (as heretofore) after  he joins  for service.  Underthe Army Act a retired army officer is already subject to military law on receipt of an order of recall to duty in virtue of his being a member of the Reserve of Officers.
