Ttttr DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT,SECRET.H.P.61  (56).        n (fiiCOPY NO. 3 *JG A B I N E T.               IMPORT DUTIES ON DRESSED LEATHER                 AND ON HATS AND HAT SHAPES.      Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.    1. I regret that I cannot support the Foreign Office proposal (CP. 58(35) and CP. 59(36)) that we should not accept the recommendations of the Import Duties Advisory Committee,    2. I a-,ree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP.60(35))  as to the difficulties of explaining a decision not to accept these .recommendations.    I should like to  draw my colleagues&apos; attention to yet another difficulty.   I have received numerous representations as to the subsidising of German exports and as to the system of assisting exports from Hungary by the use of &quot;blocked&quot;  pengoes.    To these representations I have been able to reply that the ordinary procedure of the Import Duties Advisory Committee is available to deal with these exports.    I think it would be impossible  to explain to the trades concerned  that, although the procedure is there and although they have  received a recommendation in their favour,  we do not now  propose to act.    3. It is  true that Germany  will be particularly affected by the proposed duty on dressed  leather,  as she sent us rather more  than one-third of  our foreign supplies last year,  hut a  number  of other countries  are affected - Holland and Hungary  being the most important.    In  the  case of hats and hat shapes,-  Austria sent us  in 1934  goods  (of  the kinds covered by the recommendation)  to the  value of  about  38,000                            -1-
W.R.oard of  Trade,  25th February,  1935. a year, out of her total export trade in hats of some  400,000 a year.   Czechoslovakia sent us about half as much again as Austria.   4. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer says, there is already some resentment at our delay in coming to a decision on this question.   The recommendations were made in October, and the delay will be difficult to explain to Parliament or the trades concerned.   a decision was delayed originallyby representations from the Foreign Office,  based on the desirability of not imposing new duties on countries co-operating in sanctions against Italy:   a decision has nowbeen further delayed by the suggestion that we should not impose new duties on goods coming from two countries which are not co-operating in the imposition of sanctions.   If there is further delay, or if a decision is taken not to impose the proposed duties, I fear that it will be impossible to explain the decision by any arguments basedon industrial or commercial considerations.
