STATEMENT  BY  HIS MAJESTY&apos;S  G QVERITM5NT.        1.     His  Majesty,&apos;s  Government  are  greatly  indebted to trie        Royal Commission for  the  care with which they have  examined        the problem.        2.     The  main conclusions  of the Commission&apos;s  Report        are that  the  existing system of  tithe rentcharge is        unsatisfactory  and should be extinguished on fair and        equitable terms involving the creation  of a &quot;new  issue of        stock fully guaranteed by the State,  the interest and        sinking fund  on which are to be  provided by  the  payment,        by landowners liable  to  tithe rentcharge, of redemption        annuities for a limited  period,  collected by the State.        This  stock  will be issued to titheowners in compensation        for the surrender  of  their existing  rights to tithe        rentcharge.   The  Commission estimate the amount of Stock        required for  this  purpose at approximately  70 millions.        3.     His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  are prepared  to  accept these        main  conclusions.        4.     Examination of the Report,  however, showed that        in certain  respects it was incomplete,  the CommissionCOPY NO.W-
having felt themselves precluded by their termsof reference from dealing with several points of very great importance.   Thus, speaking of thefinancial position of local rating authorities the Commission in a footnote to page 46 of theirReport state:&quot;The Treasury.......may also have to  deal with the  position arising in  respect of the loss by rating authorities of tithe  rentcharge  as  a rateable hereditament.    It is understood that at the present time local rates on tithe  rentcharge amount to approximately  1 million  per annum and while it is not within the province of the Commission to suggest a definite figure, it must be  apparant that  our  proposals,  in- volving as they do the extinguishment of  tithe rentcharge as a rateable hereditament, will mean a substantial loss which will have  to be made good out of public resources, central or local&quot;.5.      Again in dealing with titheowners   theCommission made it clear in paragraph 6 of theirReport that they did not regard their terms ofreference as authorising them to incjuire  into theapplication after receipt of sums paid as titherentcharge, and consequently did not take intoconsideration the hardship which their proposals might cause to any particular class of titheowners
2706.     On the other hand it  may he  noted that,  under the commissions Report, the Exchequer  would &quot;be. relieved of theexisting contribution of  550,000 p.a.  in respect of rates on certain ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge,  a relief off-sethowever by a new contribution of   375,000 p.a.  towards thefinance of the Commission&apos;s  scheme  (see paragraph 119 ofthe Report), together with the cost of  collection and administration^which the Commission did not  attempt toestimate.pi ONJATINGlORITIES.7,     It seemed clear to His Majesty&apos;s Government thatthese difficult matters must be faced and settled if thewhole vexed question of tithe were finally to be set atrest.  So far as the Excheauer was concerned, they were fullyprepared to sacrifice any gain which might have accrued tothe State under the Royal Commission&apos;s proposals.  But onthe other hand they did not feel justified in considering any scheme which would have imposed any new charge upon thegeneral taxpayer.    Accordingly in formulating their own proposals, which amplify the recommendations of the RoyalCommission by providing for the equitable claims of theLccal Authorities  and certain classes of titheowners, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have kept this over-riding consideration in mind.8.     It is estimated that the annual income derived from local rates on tithe rentcharge in the rural districts ofEngland and Wales  is at present approximately  850,000.The seriousness of the position created by the recommendationsof the Rcyal Commission will be realised when it is statedthat if the loss of rate income in respect of tithe rent-charge in each county had to be made good by a uniform
rate on the general body of ratepayers in its Rural Districts,the increase of rates in those Districts resulting from theabolition of tithe rentcharge would exceed ls.OcL  in a number of counties, ranging from ls,T:cL in Dorset and Essex  up to 2s.9d.in West Suffolk.90     His Majesty&apos;s Government decided that losses of this magnitude would constitute an intolerable burden on ratingauthorities and it became necessary,  therefore,  to enter into discussions with representatives of the Local Authorities mainly concerned to see how the situation could be met.   Reduction ofthe gross annual value of tithe rentcharge as proposed by theRoyal Commission would in itself have led to substantialdiminution of the Local Authorities1  income.   With this and/&apos;other relevant considerations in mind agreement  has been reachedafter discussion with the representatives of the Local authorities on the basis of a scheme of compensation in the  form of a seriesof annual payments by the Exchequer.10.     It is proposed that this series of payments to LocalAuthorities shall start with the actual rate income derivedfrom tithe rentcharge in the year 1935.   This figure cannot be definitely stated at present, but whatever the initial figureproves to be the scale will start from the point so determinedand will diminish year by year according to an agreed formulauntil the present value of the sum of the whole series is equivalent to the present value of an annuity of  600,000 for60 years.
2721T.tion PAROCHIAL SOY&quot;.11.   The o;viderice submitted to the Commission on behalf .ofthe Governors of Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty on the 7th February,1935, which was published shortly afterwards,  revealed thetact that as regards 1,137 livings, the income of which didnot exceed  300 per annum, no less than 66 per cent,  of thetotal income was provided by tithe rentcharge, while  asregards 3,829 livings exceeding  300 per annum but notexceeding  500 per annum, approximately 55 per cent,  of thetotal income was derived from tithe rentcharge.12.   At the present time the net annual income enjoyed byan incumbent in respect of  100 tithe rentcharge (par value)attached to his benefice may, if collected in full, beestimated to be approximately  94 after payment of the rate contribution, land tax, and costs of collection.  . Underthe scheme of the Royal Commission he would receive in futurefrom Government stock an assured income of  76.12s.6d.   Anincumbent whose total income is  300, of which 66 per cent.is derived from tithe rentcharge, would, therefore, underthese conditions, suffer a diminution of income of  37.   as already stated, however, the percentage of income from titherentcharge to total income in the case of benefices notexceeding  300 is an average figure, and in a number of cases,where the proportion of tithe rentcharge to income is greater,the reduction in income would be even higher.13.   Having regard to the suggestion contained in SirLeonard Ooates&apos; Minority Report that the problem wassusceptible of solution by re-arrangements within the Churchitself and by a re-marshalling of its own resources, it became necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to consult theChurch authorities as to whether the position of the poorerincumbents could be met in the manner suggested.    This con-suit at ion made it clear that while the Church authorities were 1                         -5-
                                               . -     273of the opinion that incumbents would be ready to make any reasonable sacrifice to obtain a satisfactory settlement oftrie tithe question, which had tended, to prejudice thespiritual work of the Church, the Church was not in aposition to provide from its own resources the entire sumnecessary to meet the immediate reduct ion of the incomes ofincumbents involved in the Royal Commission&apos;s Report.14.   His Majesty&apos;s Government are impressed with the factsthus disclosed and they have felt it necessary to provide in their scheme for a payment in addition to the amount ofcapital stock allocated to queen Anne&apos;s Bounty under the                                                            &quot;Royal Commission&apos;s proposals, of an annuity of  72,266 forsixty years? capitalized as a lump sum payment of  2 millions,to be used at the discretion of the Church authorities to mitigate the hardships which would otherwise be suffered, bythe poorer clergy.15.   Althought, as explained later? the cost of compensation to Local Authorities and the, further sum to be placed at thedisposal of the Church authorities can be partly met &quot;by maintaining the present liabilities of the Exchequer unchanged,it became apparent on review that some adjustment of the termsrecommended by the Royal Commission in connection with theredemption annuities was essential, either by increasing theannual amount payable by the tithe-payer or &quot;by extending theperiod of payment.   His Majesty&apos;s Government consider thatthe latter alternative, maintaining immediate relief to thetithe-payer to the full extent recommended, by the RoyalCommission, is to be preferred,  and they propose to  adopt it.The extension of the redemption period that will be  required under their plan is from 40 years,  as proposed by the RoyalCommission, to 60 years.
jjTSj?  TO        16.    The  effect  of the  recommehdalions of  the  ReportTHSFAYERS.  ,              as modified &quot;by  this  arrangement  is to reduce the              existing  liability of tithe payers  from  109,10s.Od.              per  100  tithe  rentcharge (par value) for 7c year,  in              the case  of ecclesiastical tithe rentcharges and from               105  per   100  in perpetuity in the case  of lay tithe              rentcharge, to   91.11s.2d. per  100 as recommended by              the Royal Commission, but payable  for sixty years in              both  eases.  The  immediate cash relief per annum to the              tithepayer  is equivalent  to 16.8%  and 12.4% respectively,              while the actuarial  equivalent is  22.37% and 27.6%              respectively.              17.    Under the existing lav9in any  case in which the              tithe rentcharge in  any year exceeds  two-thirds of the              Schedule  B. value  of an agricultural  holding, the              excess amount  is not recoverable.    In order to provide              for hard  cases  the Royal  Commission proposed that this              relief should be extended to cover any cases in which              the redemption  annuity exceeds one-third of the              Schedule  P. value, and they estimate  that remissions under              this  heading will  amount  to  200,000  per annum.    His              Majesty&apos;s Government propose to accept this recommendation.SJHSQU.ER        18.    Under the Tithe Act, 1925,  as  explained in theSTRI BUTTON.              Royal Commission&apos;s Report, the Exchequer is liable for              a portion of the rates payable on  ecclesiastical tithe              rentcharge, and this liability has averaged approximately               550,000  per annum in recent years.   His Majesty&apos;s              Government have decided that for the  purpose of the scheme              for extinguishment of tithe rentcharge,  an annual sum              of equivalent amount should continue  to be made available.
% 1 a)            19.     In addition,  however,  the Exchequer will now            have at its dispose! certain  further suras, consisting            partly of the saving on the present cost of adrainistra-            tion &quot;by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of            the  existing Tithe Acts, and  partly of the net additional            revenue from income-tax which will be payable by. tithe-            payers and certain classes of tithe owners in consequence            of the change of system recommended by the Royal commissioners si on.            The  additional amount available under these heads cannot            be estimated with certainty,  but is expected to average            approximately   lb 5 ,000 per annum;   and His Ma. ;jesty&apos;s            Government have decided to increase the Exchequer            contribution by this amounts in order to balance the            estimated expenditure under their scheme.

The intention of His Majesty&apos;a Government is that[JAPANTEED )CK TO      the  compensation to  be provided for tithe own era in return BE- iERS.        for  the surrender of their right to tithe rentcharge shall            take the form of the issue of a 3 per cent. Guaranteed            stocks to which there will be  attached a sinking fund            sufficient to redeem the whole of the principal in sixty            years.   According to the provisional calculations of            the  Royal Commission,  which  the Government accept subject            to further investigations, the amount required will be            as follows:-Assuming rates on tithe rentcharge at  10s o. in the  .

Provided that the estimates upon which Item vii(Exchequer contribution of  685,000) is based are realised,the effect of the whole scheme is that no net additionalcharge will fall upon the Exchequer.   Subject to thenecessary statutory authority, the whole of the financial arrangements contemplated, including the provision of thecost of administration and of any capital advances thatmay be required, will be carried outside the Budget.ILEGIST, A-IlION TOSB INTRO-DUCED.25.  It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government  tointroduce as soon as possible the necessary legislation to take effect as from a day to be  appointed  by Statute.Any arrears of tithe rentcharge outstanding on the appoint-ed day will be left to be dealt with under the existing law as contemplated by the Royal Commission (see paragraph162).24.  In view of the liabilities which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are offering to take over under this scheme, theyhave a contingent interest in the assets which will be surrendered to them on the appointed day, and could notview with indifference arrangements which may be made forthe voluntary liquidation of those assets in the interval before statutory effect is given to the scheme.   They must therefore reserve the right to propose to Parliament  thatany  future statutory provision for the voluntary redemp-tion by tithe payers  of the annuities payable under thenew scheme shall apply retrospectively to any redemptionseffected between the present and the appointed day.SUMMARY.    25.   The  effect  of  the whole  scheme  may  now be  summarised           as follows.                 The  tithepayer will,  as  from the  appointed day,  be           granted a substantial  reduction in the amount of his           existing  liability, which  will  be finally extinguished in

Further, in any case where thetithe renthcarge exceeds one-third of the Schedule &apos;B&apos;assessment of an agricultural holding, the excess amountwill in future not he payable or recoverable.     -ne tithe owner will be compensated for the loss of                            - Pid-v:;&apos;^m;; :y.::rincome which he will suffer under the scheme by havinghis future income guaranteed by the State.   His capitalasset will now be a gilt-edged security, as easily market-able as any other Government stock and his connection withthe tithepayer and his land will be finally terminated.     The Exchequer will pledge its credit for the paymentof the principal and interest of the new Tithe RedemptionStock and in return will assume the powers requisite for collecting the annuities payable under the new scheme.   Itwill continue to provide an annual contribution towards thecost of the scheme of  550,000 as heretofore, and in addi-tion will contribute a sum of  135,000 equivalent to theestimated value of certain additional credits which it willhave at its disposal under the new arrangements.   It. will                                                      -also provide the machinery of collection and administrationincluding the financial facilities required by the scheme.     It is because His Majesty&apos;s Government agree with theRoyal Commission that this dispute has had regrettablesocial consequences that they have adopted these extensiveproposals which they trust, in the words of the RoyalCommission, will &quot;put an end to a secular controversy.&quot;
