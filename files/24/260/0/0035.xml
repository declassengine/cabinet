THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Secret .P. 68/36.CAB IN E T.Copy No. tf-j                     INTERNATIONAL  LABOUR  ORGANISATION.DRAFT CONVEJMTION. CONCERNING THE EMHjQBfENT OF WOMEN ON UNDERGROUND WORK IN MINES.                   Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.         The nineteenth session of  the  International Labour Conference,  held in    Geneva in June 1935,  adopted a  draft convention concerning  the employment of    women on underground work  in mines  of  all kinds, the text of which has been    published in  Cmd.  5033  (pages 4-6), a  copy of which  was circulated under cover    of CP. 41  (36).         The provisions of  the convention  forbid the employment of females    (with a few unimportant exceptions, such  as women holding positions  of    management) on underground work in mines  of all kinds.   Under the existing lav    in this country no female  can be employed underground in a  mine even in the    exceptional cases  provided for  by the  convention.         Certain  feminist societies have urged that no differentiation in  the    matter of employment  should be  made between men and  women,  but the    Mineworkers&apos;  Federation are strongly opposed to any  alteration of  the  present    law.    It is  not considered that any alteration is called for,  and as  the law    is stricter than the  draft convention  it  is possible to ratify the latter    without fresh legislation.    If necessary,  an assurance can be  given  to the    Mineworkers&apos;  Federation that the existing absolute prohibition-of  the    employment  of women underground will be maintained.         I accordingly ask  the authority of the Cabinet  to  proceed with  theformalities of ratification under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which  1will bind the country to apply the provisions of the convention for at least   $mten years.   A White Paper will be laid in the ordinary way to inform parliament of the intentions of the Government.     The Secretary for Mines concurs in this proposal.5th March, 1956.H.Q.266-70 C.F.(intd).
