Copy No-CP.  36  (36)(Also  C.I.D. Paper No.  1207-B       and CCS. 425.)                                CABINET.COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.                        CO-ORDINATION  OF DEFENCE.                    Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff.            (CIRCULATED BY DIRECTION OF THE  PRIME MINISTER.)    THE recent Press campaign calling for changes in  the existing system ofDefence Co-ordination has brought to the front  a number of suggestions whichdirectly affect  the Chiefs of  Staff Sub-Committee, and we are, therefore, of theopinion that our views on the questions raised should be brought to the notice ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence.;    2.   It may be noted that in this Press campaign suggestions which  havebeen current for many years for the creation of a &quot; super Ministry of Defence&apos;-which  would entirely, or to a  large extent,  absorb  the  three existing  service departments, have not re-appeared.  The arguments against a suggestion  havebeen publicly recited on so many occasions that it would seem that they  have at last borne fruit, and it is to  be hoped that this proposal has been disposed of.    3.   The arguments now put  forward are for re-organisation  on a  smaller scale, and in so far  as they are constructive, the proposals centre round theappointment of a Minister of Defence, whose main duties apparently are to act asdeputy to the Prime Minister in defence matters, as Chairman of the Chiefs of.&quot;Staff Sub-Committee and as head of an independent Joint Planning Staff.Ministerial Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.    4.   The opinions expressed in the Press are  not unanimous as to the status-of the proposed &quot; independent &quot; chairman of the  Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.One or two record the view that he should be a civilian official and not  a Minister.but the consensus of opinion seems to be that the nature of the duties which would fall upon him make it necessary that the Chairman should be of Ministerial rank..If such a Chairman were to be appointed, it seems to us essential that he shouldhave this status, and our consideration of the matter  is, therefore, based on this-assumption.    5.   The main argument for the appointment of such a Minister is  that, apartfrom the  Prime Minister,  who is  too  burdened with other duties to  attend meetings of the  Committee  more  than occasionally,  and  the  three  defence ministers who would generally have a departmental interest in the problem underreview, there is no one of Ministerial rank in constant touch with the work of theChiefs of  Staff Sub-Committee.   In consequence, when the Prime Minister is called upon to act as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, and to makea decision, usually of the highest consequence, on  a matter upon which the Chiefsof Staff themselves have found it impossible to reach agreement, he is embarrased by insufficient  knowledge, both of  the day to day  work of  the Committee, and ofthe full implications of the subject in question.    6.   It is claimed that  a Minister  of Defence, acting as Chairman  of theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, would have the Ararying points of view  clearly put before &quot;him, and would then be in a position to assist the Prime Minister in coming to a decision in the best interests of defence as a whole.[12712]B
    7.  This argument is, however, based on  a  mis judgment  of  the  degree of attention  which  the  Prime  Minister  does, in fact, give to the  work of thisCommittee.  We are informed that the Reports  which we prepare for the cabinet or the Committee of Imperial Defence,  and the papers on which these Reports are based, are regularly studied by the Prime Minister.  In addition, the Secretary ofthe Chiefs of  Staff Sub-Committee states that  he frequently informs the PrimeMinister of any aspect  of the discussion on  the Committee or of  the  views expressed which may not have been fully recorded in the papers themselves.  it follows that when,  as occasionally happens, diverging views are expressed which any Chief of Staff is unable to modify by reason of the responsibilities which he feels towards his own Service, the matter can be  brought to the Prime Minister for decision, and  the latter  should certainly have sufficient  knowledge  of the caseeither to give a decision himself, or, if he wishes  for further advice,  to refer thepoint to a small Cabinet Sub-Committee of appropriate composition.  At present-our conclusions can be reached only by goodwill  and agreement amongst ourselves.If  a  civilian chairman  were  appointed to  preside over our  discussions,  thetendency would be  for each of us to come prepared to state his own case and tohold firmly to it.  This would be a retrograde step after all the years during whichmutual understanding and  co-operation have been fostered; its effects would soonpermeate  down  from the Chiefs of Staff   to  the junior  members  of  the headquarters Staffs of the Services.  In these circumstances we do not feel thatan  independent  Chairman  of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee  would serve a useful purpose, or be able  to add to the  information at  present available to thePrime Minister or to any ad hoc Cabinet Sub-Committee he may decide to appoint.    8.  The various suggestions put  forward to amend the existing machineryare based on a number of  criticisms, not always well informed, of  the presentsystem.  No system can be perfect, but with  the  exercise of goodwill,  we are ofthe opinion that  the existing  system works well,  and is continuously improving.It has,  indeed, been severely  tested during the emergency caused by  the  Italo-Abyssinian Dispute, and has  not been found wanting.   During this period, theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee have prepared a number of papers  and apprecia-tions  dealing  with the crisis.   In  particular,  the co-ordination of all  defence measures in the Mediterranean and Red Sea areas has been arranged, and as aresult the co-operation of  the three Services has probably been closer  than in.an)r previous preparations..4 &quot;Minister of Supply.&quot;    9.  One of the more important letters which has appeared in  the  Press wasa joint letter from Field-Marshal Lord Milne and Lieutenant-General Sir J. R. E.Charles.  The opinion of officers so experienced deserves to be fully considered.In  addition to the  suggestion of a Ministerial  head of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee,  which for reasons  given above our  Committee do not  support, thesetwo officers  recommend that  the Minister should have the Chairmanship of thePrincipal Supply Officers  Committee.  An extract from their  letter is given at appendix to this Memorandum,  from which it will be seen that,  in their view,the time  has come to expedite planning for  industrial mobilisation.   their suggestions are that the Minister should also be responsible for  implementing therecommendations of the Principal Supply  Officers  Committee and of  its sub-committees, and it is urged that the whole-time attention of a Minister is requiredto solve the problems which lie in this field.    10.  Supply organisation  is not primarily a matter for the Chiefs  of StaffSub-Committee, but we are fully aware of the  great difficulties which  lie ahead,not only in production of material necessary for  reconditioning our  defence forces,but also in the organisation of industry to meet  the event of war.  It may wellbe  that our organisation can be improved, especially in connection with thosepreparatory measures which must  be  taken  to ensure  that firms  supplying thethree services can depend on adequate quantities of  raw and semi-manufactured-material.   .  11.  We  think this is a matter which  might  well  be investigated by thePrincipal Supply Officers  Committee  themselves,  as  they are  better acquaintedthan  we are with the difficulties of the problem.  We consider that their opinion should  be sought as to whether the appointment  of a Minister of Supply would facilitate the task,  and, if  so,  what should be the scope of his functions.
[12712]A Joint Staff.     12.  The proposals put&apos;forward in connection with a joint staff are, briefly,.that the  existing Joint Planning Sub-Committee should be replaced by a bodyof officers, graduates of the Imperial  Defence College,  who, under the direct&apos;control of the Minister of Defence, shall be&quot; permanently at work on the broaderproblems of defence.&quot;  It is claimed by the supporters of such a suggestion that plans so  framed  would be  free from  outworn  Service traditions and pettyjealousies.     13.  The effect of such an arrangement would of course be that the Minister-of Defence might well be presented with conflicting advice from his Joint Staff&quot;on the one hand and from the  Chiefs of  Staff on the other.  If he accepted theadvice of the Chiefs of Staff the work of the Joint Staff would be wasted, and ifhe accepts  the advice of  the Joint Staff, over the heads of the responsible headsof the Services,  an impossible position  would  immediately  arise.   The drawing up of plans must rest with those who are responsible for  carrying them out, andwe  cannot believe that the Chiefs of Staff would  ever  be asked to carry outplans in  the preparation of which they had not been consulted and with whichthey disagreed.  The constitutional position of the three heads of the  Services;would obviously be gravely affected.     14.   There  is a further  point.  Plans  of  all  sorts have to be drawn up in.close  collaboration  with  the  Intelligence and Administrative  Branches of the staffs, and a plan which does not take proper account of the. many factors withinthe domain of these branches is waste paper.   The members of a  &quot;super staff,&quot;&apos;out of touch with the Service  Departments, where alone  the requisite informationcan be found, and very probably under suspicion by those  Departments, cannotbe expected to work effectively.  In these circumstances  the  position of such a staff would indeed be unenviable.     15.  Of all  the varied proposals  which have recently been put forward, weconsider that this suggestion  of  a &quot; super staff &apos;&apos;  giving independent advice to a minister of Defence is the least practicable,  and is in our opinion definitelyundesirable.Reinforcement of the. Joint Planning Sub-Committee.  -  .16.   We are  as fully  aware  as any  publicist of  the necessity  for  the continuous consideration of defence plans in their broadest  aspects. We believe this can be achieved within the framework of the existing  system, maintaining the proper constitutional responsibilities of  individuals and Departments.     17.   The existing Joint Planning Sub-Committee  is  composed of three-officers a Captain, R.N., a Colonel and a Group Captain, R.A.F.   These officers have whole-time work in their  own Service Departments, but they have, never -theless, and especially  in the present emergency, rendered us the most valuableservice.  They have carried out  all our instructions, prepared Reports, very oftenat short notice,  and held many meetings at the expense  of their Departmentalwork which was accumulating in their absence. We  do not wish to replace them,.but we think that they should be given help, and we recommend that each  of thembe given an assistant (who might be of the rank of Commander in the Navy, andits equivalent in the other Services).  Officers of this rank  will not have passed through the Imperial Defence  College,  but we think that is  of less importancesince the members of the Joint Planning Sub-Committee themselves are,  or willbe in the future, graduates of that College.     18.  If this recommendation is approved, it will  be essential to recognisethat the  assistants  so appointed must not be entirely cut off from departmentalwork in  the branches  of their  respective Ministries  controlled by the  several members of the  Joint  Planning Committee.  They  could be  employed in thesebranches, according to the requirements of the individual Ministries, to work onsubjects which were to come  up for consideration at some future time.  In this-:way, they would, like the members of the Joint Planning Committee themselves,,;be kept in touch  with the  strategic problems of their own Services, and they wouldnot suffer from having to deal with second-hand information  as they would if theyworked entirely at  2, Whitehall Gardens.  Meetings of the  Committee would be attended  by the members and  their assistants,  and, on  occasions when  the attendance Of the members was not required for more important decisions, e.g., in&apos;.the preparation  of combined  drafts for the consideration of the Committee, thc-three assistants  could meet independently.
     19.   We consider that the scope of the work done by the Joint: planning committee, thus more  adequately  staffed, might with advantage  he increased;This Committee could be used to a greater degree by the Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee both in the preparation of drafts of current Chiefs of Staff papers andin consideration of subjects which are likely to come  before the Chiefs  of StaffSub-Committee.  The preparation of  such reports as annual Chiefs  of StaffAppreciations, &amp;c, could well be entrusted to the Joint Planning Committee.:!..,     20.   We consider, further, that a Joint Planning  Committee formed on suchlines should  be provided with a Secretary who could devote his full ^attention tothe secretarial side of the Committee.   This would  involve an  increase of; oneofficer, and some small clerical additions, to the  existing staff  in the secretariat-of the Committee of Imperial Defence, since the existing staff are  already fully occupied with the ever-increasing volume of work.                     . &apos;-     .,Co-ordination of Intelligence.     21.   This is another subject which has been  briefly referred to in the  Press.We have  already given  the matter consideration, and a Report on the  subject,-containing certain recommendations, has been brought before the Committee ofImperial  Defence.    22.   Our conclusions are as  follows :      (a) We  set  store  on the full  and frank discussions  which under  present           arrangements take place at the Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee, and we           do not think  that the appointment of an independent Chairman will           assist matters.  (Paragraph 7.)    (b) Adequate means exist  to enable  the Prime Minister  to  inform  himself           of the matters  on which the  Chiefs of Staff seek his decision, both           through the written reports made to him, and through verbal communi-           cation by the Secretary.  (Paragraph  7.)    ip) Matters on which the Chiefs of Staff have not been able to reach agree-           ment  are referred to the Prime Minister, who either gives a  decision           himself, or assembles  a small Ministerial Committee to  assist him in           reaching a decision.   (Paragraph 7.)    id) At present our conclusions are reached by goodwill and agreement.  If a           civilian chairman were appointed the tendency would be for  each of           us to come prepared to state his own case, which would be a retro-           grade  step  in  fostering   co-operation   between  the  Services.           (Paragraph 7.)    (e) With the exercise  of goodwill the existing system works well  and  has           not been found wanting during the severe test of the emergency caused           by the Italo-Abyssinian dispute.   (Paragraph 8.)    &apos;(/) We recommend  that the Principal Supply Officers should be asked to           consider whether  there are means by  which their  own work  may be           expedited,  including . the proposal for a  &quot;Minister  of Supply.&quot;           (Paragraphs  9-11.)     (g) We  are  firmly  opposed to  the proposal of an independent Joint  Staff,           working under the direction of, and advising, a Minister of Defence;           (Paragraphs  12-15.)    .(/&amp;) We  recommend  that the existing Joint Planning  Committee should be           reinforced by the appointment of an assistant to each Member of that           Committee, for Joint Planning work.  (Paragraphs 16-19.)   ;    (i) If this is approved it will be necessary to provide an additional officer,           and some small clerical additions,  for the  staff of the Committee of           Imperial Defence.  (Paragraph 20.)    (?) We  have reported separately on  the   Co-ordination of  Intelligence.           (Paragraph 21.)                    (Signed)      ERNLE CHATFIELD.                                  A. A. MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD;                                  E.  L. ELLINGTON.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,     February 10, 1936.

Until this last year or so financial stringency has doubtlessprevented  the  Service  Ministries from  doing  very much to  implement therecommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and it is just here thatthe institution of a Minister  for Defence is most urgently needed.  He could bring his  whole-time attention  to  the detailed study of  the problems involvedin a manner quite impossible for a Service Minister with his heavy departmental responsibilities and with Parliamentary calls on his time.  The Defence Minister,with Cabinet authority behind  him, should be able to give more  rapid effectto all decisions reached than is now possible, and without having recourse to theinterminable  delays which seem to be  inseparable from departmental handling ofsuch important questions.
