            THE GOAL MIMES REORGANISATION COMMISSION.             (Part II of the Coal Mines Act, 1950).             Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.     1,  With the publication of the recent Report of the CoalMines Reorganisation Commission (Cmd. 5069 of 1936) it has&quot;become known that Part II of the Coal Mines Act, 1930;, has proved unworkable, and a decision cannot be delayed on thequestion whether it should be repealed or amended.  In other words, are we to abandon a policy of compulsory  amalgamationfor the coal mining industry, or not?                      Historical Summary.     2.  All the Commissions and Committees which have considered the matter during recent years, from the statutory commission of 1919 onwards, have emphasised the  need ofconverting the industry into a smaller number of units of greater average size than the fifteen hundred odd units of whichit at present consists.  The Mining Industry Act of 1926established machinery to enable the industry to carry outamalgamations for itself, even to the extent of compellingunwilling minorities to participate, but leaving the initiativeentirely with the colliery owners, with the result that little or no progress was made against the combination of inertia and mutual distrust so long a characteristic of the industry.Accordingly, the Coal Mines Act of 1930 (part II) set up the goal Mines Reorganisation Commission, whose duty was &quot;to further the reorganisation of the coal mining industry&quot; and &quot;for thatpurpose to promote and assist amalgamations where they appear tothe Commission to be in the national interest&quot;.  The Act of 1930gave the Commission the same right to ask the Court to coercecolliery owners as the Act of 1926 gave to colliery ownersagainst one another, and imposed upon the Commission the
obligation in certain circumstances themselves to prepare and submit to the Court schemes of amalgamation where they considered them expedient, and where the colliery ownersconcerned failed to do so.   3.  It was, I think the hope of Parliament in 1930, as it certainly was that of the Members of the Commission when theycommenced their work, that it might not prove necessary touse the machinery of compulsion.  Nevertheless, no one doubtedthat such a machine had now been made available and that, inthe last resort, it could and would be used.  Those who stillhoped for effective action on the part of the coal ownersthemselves were, however, again doomed to disappointment.With the change of Government in 1931? the obstructiveattitude of the Mining Association became so pronounced thatthe Commission felt bound to ask the new Government for a specific declaration of their support and confidence.  this declaration was given in the House of Commons on the31st May, 1932, by the Attorney  General, and so far stillholds good,   An extract from the Attorney General&apos;s speechis attached.                     The West Yorkshire Case A   4.In spite of this declaration, the attitude of the colliery owners as a v/hole remained hostile, and the mining association specifically questioned the legal powers of theCommission to establish before the Court a case for compulsoryamalgamation.  The Commission, however*.proceeded  steadily withthe preparation of schemes, and were also able.,  from time totime, to give help to colliery owners in effecting voluntaryamalgamations (notably the merger of the Powell DuffrynCompany with the Welsh Associated Collieries).   Eventually,last year, they decided to prepare and submit to the  Court  ascheme of &quot;partial&quot; amalgamation for West Yorkshire,  which  hadthe support of a large majority (56 out of 60 concerns, or88% of the total production)  of  the  owners  concerned.   This                          -2-
 case was heard by the Railway and Canal Commission in May last and was rejected both on merits and on law, as the Reorganisation Commission record in their present Report.    5.  Subsequent to this the legal issue regarding &quot;total&quot; amalgamations was referred to the Law Officers of the Crown, and they have now advised definitely that if compulsory amalgamation is desired as a matter of policy, amendment of the law is necessary.                       The Present Pp,sj;bicn.*.    6.  The position with which the Government is now faced, therefore, is this.  The Commission was intended by Parliament to have powers of compulsion:  and in the debates on the Bill of 1930 all parties assumed that the Bill gave those powers.   It has now, however, become clear that the Act as drafted does not  give the powers which it was intended (and thought) to give. We cannot leave matters as they are,  namely,  have a statutory (and expensive) Commission in being bereft of any real authority.   In my view,  therefore,  the Government has before it the  alternatives cf repealing Part II. (and thereby specifically abandoning the policy of furthering amalgamations in the  coal industry, if necessary by compulsion)  or of amending it in such a  way as to give the  Commission the powers which Parliament  originally intended to give  them.    7.   I  would  submit that we  cannot  contemplate the  repeal of Part II,   In the  first  place,  on  economic  grounds,  apart from  the well-known advantages  that are  ordinarily  claimed for units of a reasonably large  size,  amalgamations  are a vital complement to the policy of  centrally  controlled  selling.   That policy was successfully  pressed  upon  the coalowners as the most likely means of  getting results  quickly enough to avoid a strike.  But it is only a. step along the road, not the end of the journey, as, with so many different participants, organised selling would not be nearly so  successful as it would be in conjunction with a properly organised industry.  Nor is it by itself likely to ensure the concentration of the industry to the extent that is desirable.                               -3-
   8. In the second, place, on political grounds, it would heimpossible to go back on a policy which has been unanimouslyadvocated by a series of impartial courts of inquiry, and accepted by Parliament, especially as we cannot ignore theviews of the Reorganisation Commission itself.   In the reportsit has from&apos; time to time published it has made quite clear itsown opinion that the experience of the last five years hasstrengthened and not reduced the need for amalgamation.   Thepolicy has had the declared support of successive Governmentssince the Act of 1930 became law.    Moreover, as recently asthe 3rd December last, in the Debate on the Address, the PrimeMinister referred to the important functions of Part II of theAct in connection with the Government&apos;s coal policy as a whole.At that time, of course, the Law Officers&apos; decision had not yetbeen given.   The issue is therefore no longer whetheramalgamations are desirable or not, but whether they should, inthe ultimate, be forced upon the industry.   I am convincedthat they will not be made except by compulsion or under an effective threat of compulsion.   9. I do not at all despair of further progress by voluntary action.   A considerable number of individual coalowners (as was evidenced in the West Yorkshire case alone)  arefavourably disposed, to amalgamation.    But I am absolutelycertain that once the overriding power of compulsion is removed,the impulse towards voluntary action will disappear with it.I have previously referred to the  inertia and. mutual distrustwhich are such fixed characteristics of the coal industry:   andI am convinced that they are as potent to-day as they have ever been, when colliery owners are taken as a whole.    Only ifcompulsory powers are an imminent  reality will the progressiveelements in the industry face the  unpopularity involved inmaking their voices heard, or,  indeed,  will they raise theirvoices at all.
    10. For  this reason therefore I recommend one last and final breathing space for  the owners, and suggest  that in re-affirming the Commission^ compulsory powers the Bill should specifically preclude the application of compulsion until the lapse of a period of two years after the passage of the Bill.   The industry would thus  have had eight years in which to re-organise, and after 1938 the Commission would have the undoubted right compulsorily to make amalgamations provided that the Court has the last word in any dispute as to terms. I suggest also that the effective instrument creating any compulsory amalgamations prepared by the Commission should be an Order of the Board of Trade, thus keeping alive a form of Parliamentary control.   If the Bill is approved it should in my view become law as scon as possible, so that we may take advantage of the better atmosphere existing in the industry as a result of the settlement of the wage dispute, and also because the whole nation would to-day welcome any action by Parliament which might help to improve the structure of the industry.   The last three months have shown all too clearly that its present. organization yields neither a reasonable return on the capital invested nor a decent wage to the men which it employs.                         Rec ommendation.    11.  I therefore recommend that a. Bill should be prepared forthwith,  and submitted to the Home Affairs Committee as soon as possible, to amend Part II of the Act of 1930,  so as  to remedy the deficiencies disclosed by the Law Officers&apos;  opinion, and to re-establish beyond doubt the intentions of Parliament to vest in the Reorganisation Commission powers to compel amalgamations in the coal industry to the extent that they  are desirable in the  national interest and  cannot  be  secured  by voluntary action on the part of the  coal owners themselves. Such a  proposal is neither novel  nor revolutionary:   it would he merely declaring the law to  be what  everyone since  193 0 has assumed that it is,  with the important  difference  that the power of compulsion,  now re-affirmed, would be  specifically post-dated. in its  actual application for a period-of not  less  than two years,                         -5-               H.C.  12/2/36
Official Report - 51st May, 1932.        EXTRACT PROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL&apos;S SPEECH      ON THE SECOND READING OF THE COAL MINES BILL.     Another question which was asked me was, &quot;&quot;Why has therebeen no reorganisation?&quot;   The owners may have been more to blame than the miners;  I do not say they have been, but thefact is that reorganisation has not proceeded as it was hopedit would as a result of Part II of the Act, because of the uncertainty prevailing in the industry.     I say, on behalf of the Government, that when this Billis out of the way the Reorganisation Commission set up by part II of the 1930 Act can take up the task that was committed to it by Parliament with energy and a certainty that the Government not only hope but intend that it should proceed with its task.   There is certainly-an opportunity,now that we have set up this industry in comparative stabilityfor 12 months, for the commission to undertake its task v/ith avigour and an assurance not possible as long as they thoughtit was practical politics that Part II of the Act might be repealed.   The Minister for Mines and the  President of theBoard of Trade will do anything that is necessary to encourage the Reorganisation Commission to put into force the powersthey already have, and the passing of this  Bill will help tocreate the conditions in which reorganisation can take place.
