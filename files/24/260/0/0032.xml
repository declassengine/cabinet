Imports in January at  70 m. were   8.1 m. more than in January, 1935.  Over three-quarters  of the rise was in food and raw materials.   Of the  increase of  1.8 m. in manufactured goods, over  450,000  was in respect of oils, fats and resins, and over   350,000 of non-ferrous metals and manufactures thereof.       Exports of United Kingdom produce at  34.5 m. were   1 m. less than in January last year.       Re-exports amounted to  4.3 m.,  700,000 less than  in January, 1935.       EMPLOYMENT. The total number of unemployed persons  on the registers at 20th January was 2,159,722, an  increase of 291,157 as compared with 16th December.       The main variations were:-               London .......  + 43,696               South Eastern.  * 28,712               South Western.  + 21,018               Midlands.....  -(- 49,454               North Eastern.  * 50,690               North Western,  4- 52,353               Scotland.....  4- 29,635               Wales ........  -j- 15,599.       The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64  in employment was 10,349,000.  This was 282,000 more  than at 28th January,  1935, but 250,000 less than at  16th December.   The usual seasonal decline was  accentuated by adverse weather conditions,  especially  in  the building and public works contracting industries *  Employment also  declined in the distributive trades,  metal goods manufacture,  steel-melting,  rolling,  etc.  general engineering,  furniture making,  printing,  the  cotton,  wool and hosiery industries,  tailoring, brick____              -1-  .
and tile etc. making, stone quarrying, the transport trades,the fsod industries and the hotel and bearding house serTices,     Railway Traffic.   For the four weeks ended 26th Januaryrailway traffic increased by  301,000 (2*89 ) compared with thecorresponding period of 1935.   The increase amounted to 0.9%in passenger traffic, 1.1%&apos; in respect of merchandise, minarahsand livestock, and 8.6% in respect of coal, coke and patent fuel.     Shipping.  The Chamber of Shipping index number for freights(1913 s 100) was 90,64 as against 96.11 in December and 79.36 ayear ago.     Banking.   Money became very plentiful again as a result ofthe re-lending of funds called at the end of 1935 and of interestdistribution.   The Treasury Bill rate dropped during Januaryfrom 10/lld. (on the 3rd) to 10/4d.     As a result of the Agricultural Adjiistment Act judgment andthe passing of the Veterans Bonus Bill the dollar weakened duringthe month from 4*93 to 5.0.     After a temporary improvement from 7415/16 to 74-g- the francspot rate weakened to 75^16 owing to the political situation.The forward frans varied;  it was at 2? discount at the beginningand l11/^ at the end of January.     Gold prices fluctuated between 14l/4d. and 140/7-g-d.   Thesilver market was erratic with a downward trend;  the maximum and minimum prices were 2.2f-d. (2nd January) and 19d. (17th January)-,     Coal.  The average weekly output of coal during the 13 weeks ended 25th January was 4,735,000 tons as compared with 4,526*000tons in the corresponding period a year ago - an increase of4.6%.   The average number of wage-earners employed was 753,800as compared with 768,600 a year before.     Exports in January amounted to 2.8m. tons as compared with3o4m, tons in January, 1935.   The decrease was spread ever mostmarkets, including Italy (400,000 tons) and Spain (144,000 tcrs);but there were increases to some markets, including the IrishFree State and Egypt.                         -2-

Steel production  amountedto 911,700 tons against 757,800 tons in January, 1935, but demandcontinues exceptionally strong and the scarcity  of  semi-finished steel remains acute.   Some relief has been given by increased imports from the Continent.    Demand for finished steel recoveredafter the coal settlement and  is very strong for shipbuilding and structural steel.   Export trade remained steady at a ratherlow level, but overseas buyers were showing more interest at theend of January,     Scotland.   Steel production  is still higher and prospects are very favourable.   The enlarged capacity of  rolling mills is fully occupied.   General engineering demand (largely for export)has improved.     North East Coast.   Pig-iron  consumers have great difficulty  !in obtaining supplies.   Steel makers have orders for months tocome and makers of semis and black sheets are reluctant to bookfurther business.     Sheffield.   Business has recovered to the high levelprevailing before Christmas.   Deliveries of basic  steel billetsare in arrears.   The extension of steelworks is proceedingsteadily.   .  South Vales.   Makers of  semi-finished material have difficulty in keeping up to date with deliveries.   The demand for for sheet and tin plate-bars has increased and more furnaceshave been put into commission.   Tinplates are somewhat quietthough good business has been  done.   Galvanised sheet producers,however, report somewhat disappointing conditions.     ENGINEERING.   Conditions were rather less favourable thanin December but the volume of  orders placed has in general been satisfactory.    It is anticipated that  the progress made in 1935will be continued well into the current  year.     Exports of machinery in January were valued at  3^,20 m.o  asagainst  3.18 m.  a year ago.     MOTOR INDUSTRY.  The number of motor vehicles newly registered in December,  1935, was 29,501, or 2,302  more than in December,1934;there was an increase of 1,498 in private cars  and of 804 inother vehicles.
     The estimated production of private cars and taxis for November was 27,339 units as against 22,739 in November, 1934.The production  of commercial vehicles declined from 7,525 to7,046 units.     During the year ended  31st December; exports of private  car sand chassis amounted to 54,517, and commercial vehicles andchassis to 13,685, showing  when compared with 1934 an  increase and a decrease  respectively of 24.2% and .4%,  Imports of complete private cars and. taxis in 1935 amounted to 12,333 or ,156 more than in 1934.     LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.  Conditions generally continue very satisfactory.   The non-ferrous metals trade has quietened some-what, but prospects are encouraging.  Prosperity continues inall branches of the tool trades, production in some sectionsbeing greater than ever  &quot;before.  The foundry trade is wellemployed and the press work and lock and allied trades are verybusy.     ELECTRIGAL INDUSTRY.   The improvement has been maintained.More orders for heavy electrical engineering plant were receivedthan in December.  Consumption of electricity amounted to1,970 m. units, an increase of 14.9$$ over January, 1935.     SILK ASP ARTIFICIAL SILK.     Rayon.  The demand for yarns from the  weaving section is rather disappointing for the time of year,  but has latterlyshown a tendency to improve.  The hosiery trade is reasonably good and the underwear trade is beginning to improve.   business in rayon piece goods started briskly at the beginning of the year,but demand has since  fallen off owing to national mourning.     Silk.   Sales of silk goods are  being maintained but,  owingto the further fall in the price of  raw silk,  buyers  arereluctant to place  contracts for future delivery.     COTTON.  The industry was considerably more  active than inDecember.   Average  weekly deliveries of raw cotton to  spinnerswere 29.5 m. lbs.  against 25.4 m.lbs.  in December and  27.4 rn.  lbs.in January, 1935.   American raw cotton  prices  continued to fall              :          -4-
and Egyptian prices were unsettled.   Spinners&apos; margins  were maintained  in  the American  section  and  increased  somewhat  inthe Egyptian.     Yarn exports at  12.9 m.  lbs. were  1 m. lbs.  greater thanin December (Germany  and Holland being  mainly  responsible),but slightly less than  a year ago.  Exports of piece  goods at166.7 m. sq..yds were  19 m.  sa..yds more  than in December but20.6 m.sq.yds  less than in  January, 1935.  As  compared  withDecember, exports increased to India  (by 10 m. so..yds),  Canada,Denmark, Egypt, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand  and switzerland.     TOOL.  The general activity of the industry  declinedsomewhat during January.  In  the woollen section  orders were onthe whole well maintained,  but there was some slackening in demand in the worsted spinning and weaving sections.     Raw wool prices  hardened.  Exports of tops,  yarns andtissues increased compared  with December.  Yarn exporters reporincreased competition on the Continent  from Japanese  dry-spunyarns.     HIDES AND LEATHER.  A  slight upward tendency in  the priceof hides continued during January.  There was an  appreciableincrease in business  done in many sections of the leather trade as compared with the  two previous months.   Demand for soleleather was good and business in upper leather was steady.     CHEMICAES.  Deliveries of alkali and chlorine products inthe home market increased over December, but exports  declined.Deliveries of industrial nitrogen products were fairly well maintained.   Sales of dyestuffs continued to increase.  Sales ofertilizers have been slower this season than last,  but it  isexpected that the deficit will soon be overtaken;  sales to  theEmpire increased but  foreign sales declined.   Substantialbusiness was done in most coal tar products.                        -5-
B $ 9     POTTERY -  There is some fear that the slackening in demand for general earthenware and sanitary ware of fireclayin December may have been more than seasonal.  Other sectionshad a satisfactory month.     BUILDING.  The general position of the industry remainsfavourable.  There is a continued increase in the building planfigures for dwelling-houses.  Slum clearance activity is graduallyincreasing and more commercial and industrial building seems likely.  Conditions in the public works section continueunfavourable but there are signs of some improvement.  Theincreased activity in the building materials industries ismaintained.     RETAIL TRADE.  The money value of retail sales in December,1935, was 9.1%&apos; greater than in December, 1954.  All areas sharedin this improvement.  Sales of food and perishables continued to expand, the rise being 10.1%, as compared v/ith 7.3% for february - November.  Sales of other merchandise expanded by8.1%, as compared with 4.1% for February - November.     CO - OPERA. TIVE TRADE .  The sales of the Co-operative wholesale society for the five weeks ended 11th January were 15.4% morethan sales a year ago.  The weighted average of the wholesaleand retail prices of seven of the principal commodities wasrespectively 7.35% and 2.43% higher than  a year earlier.     CANADIAN TRADE.  Economic conditions in Canada in Decemberwere slightly less favourable than in November and the physicalvolume of business declined.  Wholesale prices receded slightly.After seasonal adjustment, there were gains in lumber and copperexports, but nickel exports fell considerably.     Imports of raw cotton were heavy, but crude rubber and crudepetroleum imports declined  :sharply.   There was increasedactivity in the primary iron and steel industry.
     AUSTRALIAN TRADE.  2,376,459 bales of wool were received into store from the 1st July to 31st December as compared with 2,391,853 a year ago; while 1,431,223 hales were sold or shipped as against 1,103,752 bales in 1934.  Wheat and flour shipments from the 1st December, 1935, to the 28th January were equivalent to 16.25 m. bushels of wheat, against 16.99 m. bushels a year ago. Butter exports from the 1st July, 1935, to the 25th January amounted to 55,946 tons as compared with 67,089 tons a year ago. Imports of merchandise during December amounted to  9.09 in. (Australian currency) compared with  7.03 m. in December, 1934.     SOUTH AFRICAN TRAPS. Conditions at the end of 1935 were very prosperous and the outlook was exceedingly bright (except for drought in certain districts).   Imports in November were 18.8$ greater than in November 1934.   Exports (excluding bullion and specie) were 40&apos;; more, due largely to bigger shipments of wool and hides and skins.  Gold output was slightly less than in October.  Cattle and sheep prices rose and grain prices remained firm.  The upward trend of activity in the manufacturing industries continued.     INDIAN TRADE.   In 1935,  total imports of merchandise increased in value  by 7% and exports by 6% over 1934;  importsfrom the United Kingdom increased by 4% and exports of domesticproduce to the United Kingdom declined by  3%.
