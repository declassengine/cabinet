STATEMENT  RELATING  TO DEFENCE                               I.   In  March  of  last - year,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in  the United  Kingdom  acceded to  a suggestion which had often  been made that consideration by the House of Commons of the estimates for the Defence Services should be preceded by a Debate on Imperial Defence  as a  whole.   Before  the Debate,  a White Paper,  dated [he 1st March,  1935,  was issued in order to indicate generally the policy  of  the  Government on  Imperial Defence, and the conditions which  necessitated their proposals (Cmd. 4827).  This year  it is proposed to follow the same procedure.  Indeed, developments which have taken  place in the world during the intervening twelve months make it more than ever necessary that the House of Commons, before discussing details of estimates, should  make a comprehensive survey of the  general problems  of  defence and  should  have placed before it the  reason and the  justification  for the  scheme  of  increased expenditure which  it will be asked to  authorise.   2.  The previous White Paper began by pointing out  what is the relation between diplomatic and political action on the one hand, and expenditure on the Navy,  Army,  and Air Force on the other. It said :  &apos;&apos; The establishment of  peace  on a permanent footing is the principal  aim of British foreign  policy.   The  first and strongest defence  of the  peoples,  territories,   cities,  overseas trade   and communications of the British Empire is provided by the maintenance of peace.   If  war can  be banished from  the  world,  these vast  and world-wide  interests will remain free  from the  dangers of attack, and the great  work of  civilisation and trade will proceed unhampered by  the  fears  that  have  hindered  their progress  from  the  earliest recorded times until to-day.  That is why every British Government is bound to use its  utmost endeavours to maintain peace.&quot;  The White Paper went  on to describe the chief methods which British policy is pursuing to secure the  establishment of peace on a permanent footing, and amongst them laid emphasis on unswerving support of the League of Nations, on the promotion of collective security and on repeated efforts  and initiatives to promote better  international understanding, and to reach international agreement for the reduction and limitation of armaments.  These objects and  purposes continueto inspire  British policy,  and the programme of defence expenditure which the country  now has  to face does  not  imply any reversal orqualification of  them,  but   is  on  the contrary  the  indispensablecondition  of their attainment.

   3.  In  recent  years successive Governments  have  deliberatelytaken  the  course  of postponing  defence  expenditure which wouldcertainly have  been justified and might indeed  have been regardedas necessary, in order to give  the best possible opportunity  for thedevelopment of a new international order in which such expendituremight  be  avoided.   Our action was thus described in paragraphs and 7  of the White  Paper of a year ago.       &quot;6. During the years that all  parties in  this country have   been  seeking  to  carry  out  the policy outlined  above, there has   been a  steady decline in the effective strength  of our armaments   by  sea  and land.  In the air  we virtually disarmed ourselves in   1919, and, subsequently,  from time to time postponed attainment   of the minimum air strength regarded as necessary to our security   in the face  of air developments on the Continent.   It is not that   British  Governments have neglected to keep themselves informed   of the position.   Every year the state of our armaments has been   anxiously considered, and if risks have been  run they have been   accepted deliberately in pursuit of  the aim of  permanent peace.   Again  and again, rather than run any risk of  jeopardising some   promising movement in this  direction by increasing expenditure   on  armaments,  Governments  have postponed the adoption of   measures that  were required  when  considered  from the point of   view of national defence alone.  In this way  we have taken risks   for peace, but, as intimated by the Secretary  of State for Foreign   Affairs  in  the debate  on the  Address  on the 28th November,   1934, &apos; disarming ourselves in  advance, by ourselves,  by  way of   an  example,  has not  increased  our negotiating power  in the   Disarmament  discussions  at Geneva.&apos; &quot;       &quot;7. Parliament and people, however, have been warned again   and again  that serious  deficiencies  were  accumulating in  all the   Defence Services, and  that our desire to  lead  the world towards   disarmament by  our example  of unilateral disarmament has not   succeeded.   We  have  not  contributed  thereby to  general dis-   armament, and are approaching a point when we are not possessed   of  the   necessary means  of  defending  ourselves  against  an   aggressor.&quot;   4.  These  considerations have gained in force during the  past year.  Conditions  in  the  international  field  have  deteriorated.Taking &apos;&apos; risks for peace &apos;&apos; has  not removed the dangers of war.We have really no alternative  in the present state of the world butto review  our  defences and to  provide  the necessary  means  both of safeguarding ourselves against  aggression and of playing our  part inthe enforcement by common  action of international obligations.  TheGovernment have therefore made a prolonged and exhaustive examina-tion  of the present state of the Navy, Army and Air Force, and theproposals they now make represent nothing more than what is foundto be essential in present circumstances.
   5.   It  should  be emphasised that in questions of defence  our situation is different from that of most other great nations.   their forces  can without risk  be  concentrated  in  limited areas near theirown shores.   Our world-wide responsibilities render this impossible.The history of the  Italo-Abyssinian  dispute, and  of our own actionin  regard  to it, illustrates  how  claims upon our  defensive strengthmay arise  at short notice in various parts of  the world.   These claimscan only be discharged if we have made adequate provision to meet them,  and the scale upon which such provision is to be made mustbe  considered in relation to the continued increase in the armamentsof many foreign countries.   6.   The development of the  dispute between Italy  and  Abyssiniawas regarded from  the  first  with grave  anxiety  by the League ofNations, which made repeated attempts to avert it.  As a Member ofthe League, no less  than as a friend to both  parties to the dispute, wewere  closely concerned.   As early as February  1935 we warned theItalian Government of  our anxiety  at the  course that government appeared to be following, and the warning  was  repeated at frequent intervals  throughout the summer of 1935.  In conjunction with theother  Members of the League we spared no effort to prevent a finalbreach.   7.   But in the  meantime  circumstances were developing whichcompelled  this  country   to  take   precautionary  action  in  theMediterranean and  Eed Sea.   The fundamental difference  that  grewup last summer between the League of Nations and Italy, combined with the possibility of League action, led during July and August lastto  a campaign of violent and  menacing  propaganda in Italy largelydirected against the United Kingdom as one  of the  foremost upholdersof  the Covenant.  A point was reached in August last when we could not longer disregard the possibility  of an incident  occurring whichmight precipitate  an extension of the conflict.   8.   His Majesty &apos;s Government felt that the best  way to securethat no such  incident should arise was to guard promptly  against it,more  particularly in view of the extent to which the Italian garrison in  Libya was being reinforced.   After considering the recommenda-tions of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the military aspects ofthe situation, the Government  decided to strengthen  and redisposeour naval  forces and to increase  the defences, garrisons and air forcesat  Gibraltar, Malta and  Aden  as  well  as in  Egypt.   From the22nd  August  onwards the situation was watched from  day  to day byone of the standing Sub-Committees of the Committee of ImperialDefence,* under the Chairmanship of the Prime  Minister, and  this sub-Committee reported direct to the Cabinet.   The most careful review of  these dispositions and arrangementsshows  that  they  were  justified  and  indeed  necessitated  by  theemergency with which His Majesty&apos;s Government had to deal.   * Entitled the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements.    [12816]                                       -        B 8
    9.   Although   in  the   circumstances   created  by  the  Italo- Abyssinian conflict, His Majesty&apos;s Government  were  able to make the dispositions which the situation required,  they were embarrassed by the decline in the effective strength of  their armaments by sea, land and air, and the accumulation of deficiencies in all the Defence Services, to which  allusion was made  in the White Paper of 1935 (Cmd. 4827).  It was only possible to  safeguard the position  in the Mediterranean and the Eed Sea by denuding other areas to an  extent which might have involved grave  risks.    10.  Even  more  important   than   the  circumstances  of any particular dispute is the bearing on our own defensive  arrangements of  the rising level of national armaments elsewhere.  It is true that an  increase  in the  armed  strength  of   other  nations   who will co-operate  for  collective security  may increase  the  power  of the League.  But an increase of armed strength may  also prove an  added power in the hands of a possible aggressor.   In any event, collective security can hardly be maintained unless every member of the League of Nations is prepared to make a contribution, adequate  in  relation to its  resources, to the strength of the  whole. We cannot excuse our own weakness by pointing to the strength of our neighbours.   Our weakness would  prevent us from playing our due part in  enforcing collective security, whereas our ability to make our proper contribution may well be  decisive in deterring  a potential aggressor from facing the risk of breaking world peace.   It  is  essential,  therefore, that the relation of our own armed forces to those of  other  Great Powers  should  be maintained at a figure which will be high enough  to  enable  us  to exercise the influence and authority  in international  affairs  which are  alike required  for the defence of vital  British interests, and  in the  application of the policy of collective security.    11.   The fact that the  level  of  national  armaments  has  been rising  all over the world is  deplorable,  but  it cannot be denied.  A plain statement as to recent increases of armaments in  certain other countries is  as follows :     12.   German rearmament has been proceeding throughout the year at a steady but rapid  rate.   As  to the fact  of the rearmament there is no concealment, and it has been referred to with satisfaction in the statements of German public men;  but regarding the details there is still a great deal of secrecy.   In March last conscription on the basis of one-year service was universally re-established; and the Government  announced   a   peace-time  army   establishment  of36 Divisions with a strength of 550,000 men.   The  German Chancellor informed Sir John Simon last  March that  Germany was  aiming  at air  parity between Great Britain, France and Germany provided that the  development of  the Soviet Air Force was  not such  that revision of these figures would become necessary.  What has since occurred indicates  a  continuous development of the German Air Force.   The Naval  Agreement  reached with  the  German Government on the
  [8th June, 1935, is in a different  category inasmuch as it limits the  expansion of the German Navy to a definite proportion of the strength  of British Naval Forces.   Nevertheless, the new German Navy, even i within this limitation, is an addition to the armaments  of the world  which cannot be left out. of account.    13.   In France  two-year service was reintroduced in the spring  of last  year.   The French Air Force  is in  process  of an  important  reorganisation and re-equipment.  The barrier fortresses on the north-  eastern frontier  are  being extended at great  cost to cover also the  northern  departments.  Special borrowing powers have been obtained  to meet specific items of defence expenditure.    14.  In Belgium the  Army expenditure shows a heavy increase  and  the   fortresses  on  the  eastern  frontier  are being rapidly  strengthened  and brought up to date.    15.  The Italian Army has been for the past six months on a war-  footing.  In October last it was stated that 1,200,000  men were under  arms, and further recruits have been called up  since that date.  The  Italian Air Force is being rapidly and completely re-equipped and is  also being enlarged.    16.  The Soviet forces, according  to the latest official figures given  by a Soviet  Minister  on  the  15th January   last,  have now  been  increased  to a  total of 1,300,000 men.  A further increase in the Soviet  Air Force is already in progress.    17.  In Japan the re-equipment of the Army  continues to be  pressed forward in accordance with a comprehensive  programme, and  greater  sums  than ever before are  appropriated in the budget for  1936-37  for the  naval and military  services combined.  Already in  1935-36 the Army and Navy accounted for 46  per cent, of the  total  budgetary expenditure,  while  the  deficit  on  the  budget  was   45 million.    18.  In the United States the total annual expenditure on defence  from  revenue  and loans combined has risen from  108 million in  1933-34  to  180 million  in  1935-36.  These figures  include no  provision for non-effective charges (e.g., pensions), which in the case  of British  estimates for 1935 represented no less than  18 million out  of the total of   124 million.    19.  His Majesty&apos;s Government will continue to  do  their utmost  to  improve international  relations  and to  promote  agreement for  limitation of armaments.   The proposals for defence  outlined in this  Paper do  not  betoken any abandonment of  the international policy  hitherto   pursued.    That  policy  has  been   steadily   directed toj  discouraging  competition  in armaments-the   recent Naval Agree-  ment  with Germany and the present effort to conclude a new Naval
Agreement with the Washington Powers are instances and it is truethat a general raising of levels all  round is  no guarantee of peace.But, in determining our own defence programme, it is impossible to disregard the  extent  of  the preparations which  have  been  madeby  others.                               II.    20.   As was stated in  the  White  Paper  of  March  1985,  aco-ordinated plan for  the  reconditioning  and modernisation of our defence forces and defences had already been  drawn up.  In the caseof the Royal Air Force the new programme with further expansionsannounced to Parliament  on the 22nd May  last was being carriedout with the utmost energy and vigour, but in  the case of the  navy and Army the steps actually taken had been directed only to making good the worst deficiencies.  The development of the situation in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, however, rendered  necessary the aecelera-tion of some of the measures contemplated and involved  expenditure which  has  been  provided  for in  the   Supplementary Estimatespresented on  the 17th February.   The  fresh  examination of theposition which was  made during the summer  and autumn led to theconclusion that it was necessary  to make further changes in the RoyalAir Force, to speed up the  measures contemplated for the modernisa-tion of the Navy and Army, to  provide  as  rapidly as possible thenecessary  reserves  of  stores, ammunition and equipment  and toorganise the industrial resources of the country in such a way  as toallow of  immediate  expansion of  productive  capacity  in case ofemergency.    21.  In the  following   paragraphs  a  brief  outline  is given ofthe objectives aimed at;  it must, however,  be emphasised that inmany respects  the  situation is constantly changing and  that it may therefore be necessary to modify the particular measures  to be taken from time  to time in one direction or the other  and the  scheme hasbeen framed with this  possibility in view.    22.  The overwhelming importance  of the  Navy in preserving oursea communications and thus ensuring to this country the suppliesof seaborne food and raw  materials on which its existence dependswas fully  set  out  in  the  White Paper of  March  last.   No less important is the responsibility of the Navy, stressed also  in the  samedocument,  for maintaining free passage  between the different  partsof the Empire of  troops  and supplies of all  kinds,  thus  assuringthe very foundation of our system of Imperial Defence.    23.  To render the Navy capable in all circumstances of fulfillingthese requirements  it will be necessary not only  to proceed with new construction at a more rapid rate than in recent years,  but also tomake good existing  deficiencies in  ammunition and stores  of all kinds.
 Ihtil the end of 1986 the strengths of all the principal Naval Powersfire regulated by treaty.  What  will remain of  this limitation after&apos;\e conclusion  of  the  present  Naval Conference is not yet certain,&quot;liit it would seem  likely that agreement  will  not  extend  beyondI jdvance notification  of annual  programmes,  exchange of information :jnd certain  measures of qualitative limitation on the sizes of ships and their guns.   24.  The agreement concluded in June 1985  with Germany is a ijtabilising factor which shows clearly the value of quantitative agree- nients when these  can be attained.  The failure to arrive at a general jgreement, however, does not  necessarily  imply  an intention on  the part of other Powers to develop their naval strength  in such a way is to upset  the balance of security, and the present plans of His )[ajesty&apos;s  Government do not  take  account  of any developments of this kind.   25.  The London  Naval Treaty  prohibits the  building  of  new tapital  ships  so  long  as  it  remains  in  force,  i.e.,  till   the 31st December, 1936,  but the  process  of  replacement  cannot  be de^yed beyond that date, and it is intended to make a beginning early  in the calendar year 1937, when  two new  capital ships will be laid down.   The modernisation of certain  of our existing  battleships will be continued.   26.  In cruisers  the aim is to increase the total  number  to  70, of which 60  would be under-age and 10 over-age.  Five cruisers will be included in the 1936 programme.   27.  A   steady  replacement  programme for  destroyers  and submarines is contemplated, while in  the case of sloops  and small craft generally, the present rate of construction will be continued.   28.  A new  aircraft carrier, of a smaller type, will be laid down atan early date.  The  growing naval importance of the  Fleet Air Armwill necessitate  a  considerable expansion  of  its  present strength.Compared  with  other Navies,  such as those of Japan or the UnitedStates of America, the  number of first line Fleet  Air Arm aircraft is considerably  lower than it should be and  it is intended to bring it up to substantially  higher  figures in  the course of  the  next fewyears.   This increase will of  course  necessitate  a   corresponding increase in personnel.   29.  Finally, it will be necessary also to increase  the personnel of  the Navy to man the  new vessels and to make  good existingdeficiencies.   The increase must be a gradual process in  order to ensureefficiency,  and by  the  31st March, 1937, the number is expected torise by about 6,000 men.   30.  The  Army has three main  functions to  perform;  it has tomaintain garrisons overseas in various  parts of the Empire,  to pro-vide  the military  share in  Home  Defence, including anti-aircraft
defence, coast defence  and internal security,  and,  lastly, in time ofemergency  or war  to  provide  a properly equipped force  ready toproceed overseas wherever it may be wanted.   The present peace-timeserving strength of the regular military field units in Great Britain is approximately 115,000 men.    31.  It must be remembered that  this force  constitutes the onlysource  from  which immediate  reinforcements  to  any  part  of  theEmpire can be drawn.   Compared with  1914,  our Army  has beenreduced by no less  than twenty-one battalions of infantry, althoughour peace commitments are greater than ever before.  Owing to  this reduction of infantry we are unable to maintain the balance of homeand foreign service battalions, and the result is hardship to the units which are given additional foreign service and injury both to recruiting and to the efficiency of our Army.  His Majesty&apos;s Government proposeto raise four new battalions  of  infantry,  which  will to  some  extentmitigate the  present  difficulties of  the  policing duties which  ourImperial responsibilities place upon us.    32.  It is not intended, in connection  with the present proposals,to- make any further increase in the number of  fighting units  in theRegular  Army  beyond  these four battalions.   But it is urgently necessary  that  the Army formations already  existing should  be organised in  the most effective form  and equipped with the mostmodern armament  and material, together with  adequate reserves ofammunition  and stores.  Plans  have  been worked out for  this pur-pose  and the necessary steps   are being taken  to put them  intooperation.   Particular  attention is  being given to our Field Artilleryequipments,  which  will be  thoroughly  modernised.    33.  The  Territorial  Army,  though  generally  regarded  as  thesecond line in our military forces, actually provides the first  line in anti-aircraft  and coast defence at home.   It is recruited  on the basis that it  will  be  ready  to serve  wherever  it may be needed,  and ifthe Regular  Army  should require support  abroad, the TerritorialArmy will  be  called  upon  to  give  that support, serving not asdrafts but  in its own  units and  formations.   It therefore  holdsan  important place,  in our defence organisation,  and it is  the  inten-tion of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government to do all  that is possible toencourage its recruiting and increase its efficiency.   For the present,owing to the demands  upon the capacity  of industrial output  whichmust  necessarily be  made in the first instance by the Regular Army,it is not possible simultaneously to recondition the  Territorial Army,but a  beginning  will be made at once in  the task of improving its presentinadequate equipment  and  training.    34.  The  modernisation of  coast defences at defended ports athome and abroad will  be proceeded with at an accelerated rate,  andthe reorganisation  of  anti-aircraft defences  in  the South-East of
 England which has already been authorised  will be extended with a view to covering the important industrial districts in the centre and north of the country.   35.   The Government also consider it essential to take immediate jteps to  improve the housing conditions of the Army, which are at present unsatisfactory,  and progress in this  matter will be made as rapidly as possible during the next few years.   36.   The prime function of the Royal Air Force is to provide an effective deterrent to any attack upon the  vital interests of  this country  whether  situated at home  or, overseas.   In  the present situation  this  is  the most  urgent  and important of  our defence requirements, and it  has rightly received  the special  attention of Parliament.   37.   The programme of  the  Royal Air  Force approved by the Rouse of Commons last year was designed to  bring up the strength of the Force  at home to a  total of 123 squadrons with approximately 1,500 first-line  aircraft.   That programme is proceeding according to plan,  but new developments in design  will  render it possible to make great additions to  the striking power of the Force.  The latest types of  machine which  will shortly  come into production show such improvements  in  speed,  range and  carrying capacity as greatly to increase  the operational effectiveness of  the squadrons to be equipped with them.  Accordingly,  the programme  already approved will be varied by effecting certain changes in composition and  at the same time some addition will be made to the numbers of aircraft.  Including four new auxiliary squadrons to be formed for co-operation with the Territorial Army,  the  new  programme will increase  the  first-line strength of the Royal  Air Force in this country, bringing up the total to approximately 1,750 aircraft, exclusive  of the Fleet Air Arm. First-line figures  taken  by themselves are,  however,  a misleading criterion of comparative air strengths, as has been explained on many occasions, and  in the present case the augmentation of offensive anddefensive power which will result from the revised plans is greatly in excess of  the numerical increase  just mentioned.   38.   The problem of co-ordinated air defence  is  occupying the constant attention  of the Committee of Imperial Defence,  with theco-operation of all  the Departments  concerned.   Modern methods ofdefence and  the correlation  of offensive and defensive weapons are continually under review, and the scheme has been so drawn up  as to ensure the necessary degree of flexibility and the full utilisation of the results obtained from continuous  scientific research and experiment.   39.   The Royal Air Force also has responsibilities in the general scheme of Imperial defence.   With our wide Imperial responsibilities, the ability to reinforce a  threatened area  in sufficient time and in sufficient  strength  demands  the location of  air units at convenient places  on  the  strategic air   routes.   The Government propose an
increase  amounting  to  approximately twelve  squadrons  for  thispurpose.   40.  Mention has  already been made  of the four new  auxiliarysquadrons  which  will form  a  nucleus for co-operation with theTerritorial  Army.   The five regular squadrons at present  allotted forco-operation with  the  regular Army  will  be reorganised to provideseven squadrons, each  of twelve aircraft.   41.  Large numbers of young men will be needed as  pilots inthe Regular Air Force, the Auxiliary Squadrons and the  Reserve.Many  airmen will be  required  for enlistment  to  meet  the variedrequirements  of the  Service; and many boys will  be needed  forapprenticeship in the skilled trades.  The available  sources of supply will all have to be brought into action, and the  full  co-operation ofthe public  will be  needed for  success.   42.  It  is, of course,  self-evident that the provision of air forces will not avail  in war  unless they  are  given the  means not only tofight but to continue fighting.   Skilled pilots require time  to train,and aircraft production  is a  lengthy  and complicated  undertaking.The provision of adequate reserves in both  men  and material is anessential and urgent need, for without them the war effort of an AirForce could not be sustained.   43.  Particular attention has  therefore been given to the provisionof these reserves in the shortest  possible time, and it can now be saidthat  adequate arrangements for  this purpose are in train.   44.  In the  meantime the passive side  of  air defence measureshas not been  neglected.   The Air Raid Precautions  Department ofthe Home  Office,  set up in  May of  last  year, has been  actively engaged in the examination of the subject with Local Authorities and satisfactory progress  has been  made.   Plans  which  have beenprepared over  a  number of years  are now approaching  the  stage whenthey can be put into  operation,  and  estimates will be  submitted indue course for  the  expenditure  which  will  be required  during thecurrent year.   45.  Before  passing to another subject  it must  once  more be emphasised that the  plans for  the  improvement  of  our defensiveforces  in all three Services must be regarded as  flexible and subjectto variation in  details from time to time.   The  whole field of pre-paration  will  have  to be kept  under constant review, and  new conditions, whether arising from changes in the dispositions  of other nations or  from fresh developments in design and invention,  must bemet by corresponding variations  in our own plans.                               III.   46.  In presenting to Parliament  a scheme of improved defenceso far-reaching in  character and likely to involve so heavy a financial
                               IS intlay, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire particularly to stress  the [act that these proposals have resulted from a thorough study of  the subject of defence as a whole.   The examination of the problem was intrusted in the first instance to a Sub-Committee of the Committee  Imperial Defence.   This Committee was composed of the Secretary  the Committee of  Imperial Defence, the  Permanent Secretary to the  Treasury,  the Permanent Under-Secretary of  State  for Foreign Iftairs and the Chiefs of Staff of the three Defence  Services.  Their inclusions were submitted to the  Defence Policy and Eequirements Committee presided over by the  Prime Minister, and  on his invitation and in view of the importance  of the industrial side of the question. Lord Weir became a member of this Committee and gave his active assistance in formulating the recommendations which  they made to the  Cabinet.  The Defence Policy  and Requirements Committee has served  in  effect both as  a General  Purposes  Committee of  tho Committee of Imperial Defence,  and as a Committee of liaison between the  Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet.  47.  Not only the general conception of the defence plans now brought forward, but  every detail included in the scheme, have been the  subject  of close examination and scrutiny by the Defence Policy and  Requirements Committee and subsequently by the whole Cabinet. In  the opinion of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government they  represent a thoroughly considered and well-balanced whole so far as conditions can  be  foreseen at this moment.   In the future they  will no doubt require adjustment from time to time as well  as continuous  super- vision and  pressure to ensure their execution.   For this  purpose  theexisting organisation  for defence has  been reviewed afresh and  the changes which  have  been approved  by  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere announced by the Prime Minister on the 27th  February, 1936,in the following terms :         This is a matter to which increasing  attention has necessarily  been devoted during recent months.  It  has been my experience  that, apart altogether  from  defence questions, the  all-round  pressure of work  has tended to increase in recent years, with a  corresponding increase in the demands upon the  Cabinet and,  in  particular, upon the Prime Minister.       When, as was explained in March  last, in  spite of all the  efforts of successive Governments to secure international disarma-  ment,  it became  clear  that we  could  no longer delay  active  preparations  for  remedying the   deficiencies  in  our  fighting  services, and when, over and above that, we were faced with our  responsibilities as a member of the League of Nations in the Italo-  Abyssinian  situation, it was obvious that  in the near future there  were bound to be large numbers of important and difficult defence  questions requiring unremitting  attention.  As there appears to be  no likelihood of any diminution in the other demands upon the  time and attention of the Prime Minister, it has  become clear in
the course of a thorough examination of the whole problem that,for the  time  being  at any rate,  he  must  have some special assistance  in regard  to defence matters.  This, of course,  doesnot mean that the Prime Minister can divest himself of the  finalresponsibility for  directing  the co-ordination of defence, nor canthere be any  weakening of the  responsibility of the  individualService Ministers.  Bearing in mind  these principles,  we havereached certain decisions.  Before saying what these decisions are should, perhaps, explain that the Committee of Imperial Defence of which the Prime Minister is Chairman has long been andmust still remain an essential link in all matters of defence.   this connection-ordinating instrument must be in a  continual state of develop-ment and adaptation to meet the circumstances of the  time, andwhen the Government  set themselves to the task of working outthe defence  proposals now  under consideration, they set up last july a special  Ministerial Sub-Committee, known as the defence policy and  Requirements  Committee,  to  keep  the  defensivesituation as a whole constantly under review so as to ensure  thatour defence arrangements and  our foreign policy are in line, andto advise the Cabinet and  Committee of  Imperial Defence in thelight  of  the international  and  financial  situation  as to  any necessary changes in policy or  in the defence proposals.  I have mentioned  this important Sub-Committee so that the references toit that I shall  make in announcing the decisions that have beenreached may be intelligible.   &apos;&apos; It has been decided that, while the Prime Minister will retain,as he clearly  must,  the  Chairmanship of the Committee ofImperial  Defence  and of the  Defence  Policy and requirements committee,  a Minister  will  be  appointed as  Deputy Chairman ofthese  Committees, to whom the Prime  Minister will delegate thefollowing duties :    (i) The  general  day-to-day supervision  and  control on the      Prime Minister&apos;s behalf  of  the whole  organisation  and      activity  of  the Committee of Imperial  Defence; the co-      ordination  of  executive  action  and of  monthly  progress      reports to  the Cabinet,  or any  Committee  appointed by      them, on the execution of the re-conditioning plans;  dis-      cernment of any points  which either  have not been taken      up or are being pursued too slowly,  and  (in consultation      with the Prime Minister or other Ministers or Committees      as required) of appropriate measures for their rectification;  (ii)  In the Prime Ministers  absence, taking the Chair at the      Committee  of  Imperial  Defence  and the  Defence Policy      and Requirements Committee; (iii)  Personal consultation  with the  Chiefs  of Staff  together,      including the right to convene under his chairmanship the      Chiefs of  Staff  Committee whenever he or they  think      desirable;
    (iv) The  chairmanship   of   the   Principal  Supply  Officers        Committee.     &quot;It  will be the duty of the Deputy Chairman to make such  recommendations  as  he  thinks  necessary  for  improving  the  organisation of the Committee of Imperial Defence.     &apos;&apos; The  position of the Chiefs of Staff  Committee  will be  as  follows the individuals  composing - it  have  a  double  function :  each  advises  his own  political  chief,  and, acting together,  the  Committee preserves unimpaired the right to submit confidential  reports of  their collective military view to the  Chairman or Deputy  Chairman   of  the Committee  of  Imperial Defence.  It  is  not  proposed that  meetings of  the  Chiefs of Staff Committee  should  normally take place under the Presidency of the Deputy Chair-  man.  He will  supplement the present activities and initiative  of the Chiefs of  Staff Committee by guidance and initiative of his  own,  his  function  being  to ensure  that  every  aspect is fully  considered and that difficulties and differences are frankly faced.     &quot; As I said earlier, the  Minister will be in a position to make  recommendations as to any improvement that he thinks necessary  in the organisation of the Committee of Imperial Defence.  In any  event, and for  purposes of  co-ordinated planning, the existing  Joint Planning Committee, which consists of the Directors of Plans  in the three Service Departments, will be supplemented by three  officers drawn  respectively from the Navy, Army  and  Air  Force,  who will be graduates of the Imperial Defence College.     &apos;&apos; The  three new officers will hold official positions on the staffs  of  their  respective  Departments.   Their work  in  their  own  Departments   will be  chiefly  that  of  obtaining  the  necessary  material for the  preparation of Joint Plans.  But their main work  will  be  on collective  plans  prepared by the  Joint  Planning  Committee for submission to the Chiefs of  Staff Committee.     &quot;In addition, steps have been  approved for the strengthening  of the Secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence.&quot;                              IV.  48.   It will be seen from the foregoing paragraphs that the new rangements   contemplated are  intended to serve  two  purposes, mely,  to  provide  an improved and strengthened apparatus for  thexmsideration  of  Defence  problems as  a  whole and  to ensure  the lest and  most  effective  use of  the  industrial  capacity  and  the n power  available for production of material in  the country.  The cond of these two  objectives requires some further elaboration.  49.   The  problem before us differs materially from that with Inch  we were faced in the Great War.   At that time the whole ergies of the country were devoted to winning the war and nothing Ise.   Special powers were  entrusted to  the  Government  which
enabled them to exercise complete control over industry and to directit into any desired channel.   To-day we  are  at peace and moreoverwe are living in a period of great commercial and industrial  activity.What we have to do is to carry through, in a limited period  of time,measures which will make exceptionally heavy demands upon certain branches  of  industry  and upon  certain classes  of skilled  labour,without impeding  the  course of normal trade.  This will  require themost  careful organisation  and the willing  co-operation both of theleaders of industry and of Trade  Unions if our task is to be suecess-fully  accomplished.  But the Government have every confidence thatthese conditions will be fulfilled.   50.  Consideration  of the position  showed  that there  were reallytwo different requirements to be met.   One has already been stated inthe foregoing paragraph, and  concerns the carrying out  of  a peace-time  programme.   The other  concerns our readiness  for  war itself.Modern war  conditions involve a vast expenditure of munitions  andequipment, and in the  early months of the Great War there was atragic loss of life in consequence of  the lack of  adequate reserves.If we are to  avoid a repetition of  that  tragedy in any future  war andto provide by  our  preparations  an   increased deterrent, we mustprepare ourselves  either by accumulating immense reserves or by soorganising industry that it can rapidly change over at the vital pointsfrom  commercial to war production should the necessity  arise.   Thefirst  alternative, however,  is only feasible within  limits, and beyond that  is ruled  out not only on account of its cost, but because  weapons and   methods  of  warfare  are  continually   changing,  and theseaccumulated  reserves  might  therefore well  become obsolete  before they  were required.    His Majesty&apos;s  Government, therefore,  have turned to the second alternative, and  they have already  taken some preliminary steps  towards  putting it into operation.   51.  Our  present  sources of supply are the Government  factories and the normal Government contractors, who, in peace, manufacturevarious types of armament.   The Government factories are chieflyresponsible for a specialised kind of output which is generally non-existent elsewhere.  This  includes the production of explosives  andpropellants, the filling of shells  and cartridges and the manufactureof fuzes, bombs, mines and torpedoes.  To meet present requirements in these categories it will be necessary to  extend or duplicate existing government  factories, and both vulnerability of site and the  needs ofthe Special Areas  will receive  consideration.   52.  The  normal Government contractors supply  warships,  air-craft,  artillery,  machine   guns,   tanks,  lorries   and  miscellaneousstores of  every description.   They also  supply a  great  variety ofarticles for export and home consumption and for both purposes theysubcontract for materials, fittings and  stores.   To  some extent it willbe possible for them to contribute to the increased output requiredby extending their plant or workshops.  But in the course of  invest!-
nation it soon became apparent that, even  for the purpose of thepeace-time -programme,  the  field  would  have  to   be  extendedto other firms not  normally engaged in armament  work, and at thesame time it was  clear  that  this extension would to some extentassist in the  establishment  of the organisation necessary to ensurerapid expansion of production  in time of war.   53.   In connection with the approved  programme  for the RoyalAir Force, steps  are  already  being taken  to extend  the  field ofproduction  by  placing orders with  firms who do  not  ordinarilymanufacture  for the  Force or for civil aviation.   This process of extension will have to be further enlarged to meet the programmes for  the Navy  and Army,  but even so  something  more  will  berequired.   54.   In order  satisfactorily to provide  for our  needs  both inpeace and war, His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to  create areserve  source of supply   which  would  be  available  in  case ofemergency.   The  method of procedure contemplated  is  to  select anumber of firms who  do not normally make warlike stores  but whoare  suitable for the purpose by reason of their experience and  their possession of a skilled staff of engineers  and workmen.   Arrange-ments would then be made with these firms for  the laying down of  the  necessary  plant  and  machinery for  a  given  output of selected  articles  and  sufficient   orders  in  peace  time wouldbe guaranteed  to  allow  of the requisite  training  in  the  work ofproduction.   The  particular circumstances will  vary  in connectionwith every firm and with different types of product.  Wide elasticityof arrangements must therefore be provided  for, but the underlyingprinciple  is   that each  selected   firm,  while  maintaining   and developing its normal civil  trade,  will agree to use its organisationand commercial structure  to  set  up  some  measure  of  munitionproduction and thus create the reserve source of supply.   55.   There  remain two  other important features of the  Govern-menfs   plans  for  the organisation of production  which  must  be mentioned.   56.   The  first  concerns  the supply of skilled labour, for whichthere will necessarily  be  a  largely increased demand.  In  some ofthe skilled  occupations  there is  already noticeable  the  shortageinevitable when large and  sudden demands are made upon laboursupplies after a period of depression.  It will be for  the industries concerned, with such  guidance as the Government can  give,  to make sure that vital processes are not held up  for want of  the necessarycraftsmen.   57.   The  second point concerns costs  and prices.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are determined that the  needs  of the nation shall notserve to pile up extravagant profits for those who are called upon tomeet them.   They are confident  that  industry  as  a  whole has no
 desire to exploit the situation, and, indeed, they have already received satisfactory assurances  from the Federation of British  Industries  of their  readiness to  collaborate.   But  when regular contractors are required  to  work  nearly  to  their  full  capacity  on  Government orders, and when large numbers of firms are asked to undertake work which is new to them and which will  have to  be  produced on equip- ment  of which they have had no previous experience,  the ordinary methods of contracting  do not offer adequate safeguards for ensuring that prices bear their proper relation to actual costs.    58.  His  Majesty&apos;s   Government  have  given  much   time  and thought to this matter  and they have been materially  aided by the experience  gained during the last few months by  the  Air Ministry working under conditions of exceptional pressure.   On the  one hand, it is important to retain the goodwill  of industry, for in peace time firms  cannot  be  compelled to  undertake  contracts on  terms which they consider unreasonable. On the other hand, difficulties  are bound to arise in dealing with  so many and such various sources  of supply, where there are  not  only contractors,  but also sub-contractors and sub-sub-contractors  concerned.   There will be  new  problems where firms  require financial  assistance in order to  lay  down  new  plant and  hold it at  the  Governments disposal, and these  cases  will be particularly urgent,  since until they are met it will not be  possible  to make a start.   It  will  be necessary also to co-ordinate the demands  of the three  Services  so that proper  priority shall be observed  and competition  between  them, which  might lead  to higher  prices, avoided.   59.   His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that all these  difficulties can  be  overcome through  the  organisation  they  have   in  mind. As  regards the  principal  contractors,  contact will be made with them  by  the Service  Departments,  while  in  the case of sub- contractors  in secondary or ancillary sections of organised industry, it is  intended  that  communications shall  pass  through  small committees  to be  appointed by  the  trade  organisations themselves. Control to prevent  excessive profits  will be effectively  exercised  by inspection  of books, adequate technical costings, audits  on behalf  of the State and arbitration  in cases of dispute.  The Government are satisfied that this  can be done without impairing the confidence and enterprise of contractors  undertaking novel and difficult tasks.   60.   Co-ordination  of  Service  requirements   will  be  effected through the existing Principal Supply Officers Committee  Organisa- tion  of the Committee  of Imperial  Defence, and the new Deputy Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence will as Chairman  of this Committee be able to supervise the whole  system of supply and correct  any deficiencies that may be  found to arise.   61.   Treasury  control  will, of course,  be maintained throughout the whole field.  It  will  be important, however,  to see that the work
is not  delayed by the over-elaboration  of  financial safeguards,  andnew  methods  of procedure are  being worked  out  which will ensurethe effectiveness of financial control without impairing the continuity of progress.   62.  Prom what has  already been said  as  to  the  necessaryflexibility  of this programme, and in view  of  the  uncertainty whichmust exist as to the rate of progress possible  over  so large a field,it will  be  realised that any attempt to estimate the  total cost of themeasures  described would be  premature at this stage.  The original estimates  for  the coming year,  which will  shortly  be  before  theHouse,  will themselves require  to be supplemented  by provision forfarther  defence  measures   referred   to   in   this   Paper;  those for the  following years must  necessarily be larger.   In the absenceof any  scheme of general disarmament it must  be anticipated that theannual cost of maintenance for the reorganised  Services must remain on a higher level, and will in all likelihood substantially exceed theoriginal estimates about to be submitted.
