MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.     1.  The Unemployment  Insurance  Statutory Committee  have  presented their annual report,  of which a copy is attached, upon the financial condition of theUnemployment Fund at  51st December  last,  in accordance  with  i  59(1.)  of theUnemployment Insurance  Act, 1935.   The Committee report that  the Fund is and  islikely to continue to he  more  than  reasonably sufficient to  discharge itsliabilities and that  the  disposable surplus is about  6,500,000 a year,     2.  In accordance with Section  59(4)  of the Act of  1935  the report must belaid before Parliament  with a  draft order making such amendments  in  the schemeof Unemployment Insurance as are recommended by the Report or  such other amendments as will have substantially the same effect on the financial conditionof the Fund.                                                              \     5.  By a majority of  5 to  2 - the Chairman, Sir W.  Boveridge,  being amongthe majority - the Statutory Committee recommend, for the reasons described in   40 to 46 of their Report, that the rate  of contributions  by employers,workers  and the Exchequer should be reduced as from next July  by  Id.  in respectof the employment of all  workers -  male and female - of the  age of 18 and over.   1Such a change will reduce the annual income  of the Fund by an  average  amount of   I 6,470,000.     4.  There are dissenting recommendations, by Mr. Arthur  Shaw  and mrs. J. L. Stocks.   Mr.  Shaw wishes to use  the whole of the  surplus  inimprovements in rates of benefit for all classes of contributors and &quot;by areduction to three days of the &quot;waiting period&quot;  of six  days at the beginning ofa continuous period of unemployment.   Mrs. Stocks wishes to  reduce &apos;the rates of  jcontributions for males but not for females, thereby putting  these rates on thesame level, and to make the rates of benefit the same for females as for males.She also wishes to increase the allowance for the first dependent child by 1/-.The changes recommended by Mr.  Shaw and by Mrs.  Stocks,  respectively,- woulddispose as near as may be  of the surplus of  6,500,000 in the Fund.                                   i.
     5. I think we should adopt the recommendation of the majority of theStatutory Committee.   The proposed reduction in the rate of contributions byId. a week for Unemployment Insurance will provide a welcome relief to employers and workpeople which will be particularly acceptable in view of therecent increase in the rate of contributions for pensions insurance.   the cuts in unemployment benefit made in 1931 were restored in July 1934 butthere has so far been no remission of the increases in rates of contribution which were made in 1931 (2d. from employer and 3d. from workers aged 18 andover).     6. Whatever merits there may be in making the rates of contributions and benefits of both sexes identical in the various age groups as Mrs. Stockssuggests, it is I think a thing that should only be done, if at all, after avery full and careful examination of the many problems which such action would create.   To do it now would certainly be regarded in many quarters asan acceptance by the Government of a principle the general adoption of whichwould be imprs-cticable.     7, I propose, with the concurrence of my colleagues, to announce inreply to a Parliamentary Question that we have decided to reduce the rates of contribution for Unemployment Insurance in respect of persons of 18 years ofage. and over by Id.  as from the beginning of July next.    It is necessary thatthe reduction should be taken into account in the Estimates for 1936-37,  andfor this purpose it is desirable to make the announcement at an early date.I propose also to publish the Report of the Statutory Committee without delay.    . 8, The reduction in contributions will need to be confirmed by aResolution to be passed by both Houses.

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE STATUTORY                   COMMITTEE&apos;  Report on, the Financial Condition of the Unemployment Fundat 31st December,  1935.,To the Rt. Hon ERNEST BROWN, M.P.,    Minister of Labour.SIR,  By  section  59 (1)  of the  Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935,we are required to  make a report on the financial condition of theUnemployment Fund  at the end of each calendar year.   In pur-suance of this statutory duty, we submit the following report on thefinancial condition  of the Unemployment Fund at 31st December,1935.  1. We  begin by  presenting in Appendix A a formal account ofthe working of the Fund in the calendar year 1935, with correspond-ing figures for 1934 in parallel  columns  for comparison.   the account has been prepared  for us by  the  Accountant General tothe Ministry  of Labour.  It is not  an audited account,  but it isin the same form as the accounts of the Fund which are presented to Parliament after audit, for the financial year ending on 31stMarch.  2. The receipts of the Insurance Account of the UnemploymentFund  for  the  calendar year were  64,771,147,  of  which all but 199,062 represented  insurance contributions  by employers, em-ployed persons and the State.   The other receipts included   181,438as interest on balances held  by the Fund.   The expenditure of theUnemployment Fund was 53,848,522, made up of  44,055,000 forunemployment benefit,  4,500,000  for administration,  5,000,000for debt service and  293,522 for minor items.   Income during 1935exceeded  expenditure  accordingly by   10,922,625,  making  withthe balance of   10,527,185 carried forward at 31st December, 1934,a net  balance at 31st December, 1935, of  21,449,810.  3. As compared with 1934, all the principal heads of income  showan increase in  1935.  The rise of  1,496,620 in contributions  from employers and employed persons is  due partly to normal growth of the insured population, partly to inclusion of juveniles  under 16for a whole year in place of four  months only,  and partly to thedecline in unemployment.   The rise of  134,187 in contributions from the Defence Departments in respect of men discharged  fromHis Majesty&apos;s Forces  is mainly due to payment of the additional contributions  required by Section 25 of the Unemployment Insur-ance Act, 1934, in respect of the extension of benefits under thatAct to men discharged  before 26th July,  1934.  The increase ofabout  800,000 in  the Exchequer contribution is proportionate tothe increase of contributions from the  other sources named above.
The substantial increase of  142,086 in interest is due mainly to thegrowth  of the  balance  of the  Unemployment Fund, but  by thechange  of investments  described  below, from  Treasury  Bills to treasury bonds,  there  has  also been an increase in the  rate ofinterest earned.  4.  On the side  of expenditure, also, there are increases under allthe principal heads in 1935, as compared with 1934. . In spite of thedecline of unemployment, expenditure on benefit has risen by about 3,467,000, mainly through  the operation for a whole year in placeof six months or less,  of the  higher rates of benefit restored  on1st July, 1934, of  the extension  of benefit by added days and of other changes in the conditions for benefit.   The rise of  561,000 in thecost of administration is due in part to increased cost&quot; of the service(arising through  such measures as reorganisation of Branch Bm-ployment Offices,  revision of scales of pay, restoration of &quot; economycuts &quot; and improvement of premises) and in part to a change in the apportionment of common  charges, after the. beginning of unem-ployment assistance.  There are increases also in the minor items of refund of contributions paid in  error ( .20,016) and grants forcourses  of instruction for juveniles ( 29,000).  The first  of  these items  depends  on the claims  made  by employers  and employed persons  ; the second depends ultimately on the rate  of expenditure by Local Education Authorities.  5. The  5,000,000 for debt service paid in two  half-yearly instal-ments of  2,500,000 each at 31st March, and 30th September, 1935,included  4,769,279 as  interest,  and  230,721  as  repayment ofcapital.  The  debt at  the  end  of  September, 1935,  stood  at 105,510,388, and interest in the current half-year is accruing at anaverage rate of 4-2  per cent.  This  rate will fall, as the earlieradvances at  high  rates are  repaid ; from 1938 onwards the rate ofinterest on the whole debt will be 3J- per cent.  In pursuance of a suggestion made by us in October, 1934, to yourpredecessor as  Minister  of  Labour, and thereafter  submitted  bythe Ministry to the National Debt Commissioners, the greater partof the growing balance of the Fund, held till then in Treasury Bills,was  gradually  invested  by  the   Commissioners  in 2  per  cent.Treasury Bonds (1935-38) and 2J per cent. Treasury  Bonds  (1937).At 31st December, 1935, the National Debt  Commissioners  held,on behalf  of the  Funds,  17,025,700 of the 2  per cent.  Bonds,and  1,794,000  of the  2J-  per cent.  Bonds.   The  Government,however, had  intimated on 2nd  December their intention  to re-deem all the issued 2 per cent.  Bonds on 2nd  March, 1936, and inthese  circumstances the National Debt Commissioners, with theconcurrence of the Ministry, who consulted our Chairman, arranged to replace the holding of 2 per cent. Bonds (1935-38) by the pur-chase  of about   10,000,000 of  a  new issue of 1  per cent. Bonds(1939-41) together with the purchase of  some  7,000,000 additional
 2J per cent. Bonds C1937).  In connection with the new 1 per cent. Bonds it was necessary to pay a sum of about  500,000 in Decem- ber, 1935, the balance being payable in 1936.  The  actual position in relation to investments is shown at the foot of Appendix A.   WOBKLNG AND PROSPECTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT FUND WITH ITS         PRESENT SCALES OF CONTRIBUTION, AND BENEFIT,  .6. We  supplement the formal account of the Unemployment Fund for the calendar year 1935, by a Table in Appendix B showing the course of unemployment and the financial working of unemploy- ment  insurance,  month by  month  from  November,   1931,  to December, 1935.  The figures of income and expenditure are  statis- tical approximations only,  without accounting  accuracy,  but  are sufficient  as a general guide  to the operation  of  the  insurance scheme.   7. In presenting our first Report, on the financial condition  of the Unemployment Pund on 31st  December, 1934, we  stated that, if during the year 1935 unemployment,  subject to  normal  seasonal fluctuations, remained  at the general level reached  by the end of 1934, the  income of the Fund  in the year 1935 might be expected to exceed its  expenditure by   10,504,000.  In the early part of 1935 there was a set-back in recovery, and the course of unemploy- ment took an  unfavourable  turn.  When, during May  and June last, we came to  prepare our second Report, signed on  4th  July, the realization  of so large a surplus as  10,500,000&apos; by the end  of the year seemed most unlikely;  the actual surplus in the  first half of 1935 was about  3,500,000.  8. In the second half of  1935,  however,  improvement set  in; unemployment  began a decline which has been substantially con- tinuous since then.  The fall in the unemployment percentage was accompanied by a fall in the proportion of the total unemployment ranking for benefit; as is explained in paragraph 21 below, this is a normal occurrence.   The expenditure of the  Unmployment  Fund was thus reduced in two ways.   In the event, the surplus realised in the year 1935, as a whole, has proved to be a little greater than the figure of  10,504,000 which we named at the  beginning of the year.   The actual surplus is  10,922,625.  9. This surplus has been realised in spite of two  changes made in the course of  the year, leading to increased expenditure.   One change is the relaxation as from 29th August,  1935, of the Seasonal Workers Orders.  The.other is the  increase  from 2s. to 3s.  per^reek, as from 31st October, 1935, in the allowance for dependent children.   Both  of  these changes  followed  on recommendations made by ourselves.   The latter is estimated to  increase  the  ex-penditure of the Unemployment Fund,  at the rate  of  1,250,000 a year.  The effect of the former is to increase slightly the propor-tion of unemployment ranking  for benefit.   Its cost to the  Fund
cannot  be estimated with  accuracy,  but seems  likely to exceedmaterially the figure of  50,000 a year which was mentionedin the.first instance.  10. The results for 1935 as a whole are given at the foot of the table in Appendix 13 and the experience of 1935  is summarised inthe first column of Table I below.  In  using this experience  as abasis for  estimates of the  future, it ,is necessary to allow for. the,two  changes named above, as  having been made  in. the  schemeduring  the  course  of  1935.  If the new  regulations for  seasonal workers and the increased allowance for children had been in force for the  whole year, the expenditure would have been greater.   Thenecessary adjustments are  made in the second column of Table I,by raising the percentage of  unemployment ranking for benefit from 47-1 to 47-2 and raising  the average amount of each weeklybenefit  payment  from  859  to  880, that is to  say, from about17s.  2d. to about 17s. 7d.  11. Before discussing the future prospects of the UnemploymentFund it is necessary to refer briefly to our two  preceding Reports,made respectively on the 21st  February, 1935,  and  the 4th July,1935, and to the steps taken to prepare for this Report.  .12. In  our earlier Reports  we laid down the  general principlethat, in considering whether the Unemployment  Fund was insuf-ficient,  sufficient, or more  than reasonable sufficient, to dischargeits liabilities, we must have regard, not to the immediate situation,but to  income and  expenditure over a period of years.  We  drewfrom this principle two practical conclusions : first, that reportingupon the sufficiency or  the  reverse of  the  Unemployment Fundmeant  making an assumption as to the  amount  of unemploymentover a future period of years not less&quot; than that of a normal tradecycle; second, that  it was necessary to set aside, from surpluses in good times, a reserve  that could be expended  in making  up the deficiencies that would  occur inevitably in times of trade depression.The arguments leading to this principle are set.out at length in ourearlier  Reports.   Here  it is  sufficient to state  the practical con-clusions ; they determine the policy on which we have acted both in preparing the. way for the present Report  and  in  reaching  ourestimates of  the future.  13. The financial basis of the Unemployment Fund, was settledunder the Act  of  1934,  in  the light  presumably of the state ofemployment at that time and  of such anticipations  as it  seemed possible to make as to the future.  In the report of the government actuary  on  the financial provisions of  the Bill which subsequentlybecame the Act, a &quot; live register &quot; of 2,500,000 was assumed as theaverage  number of persons registered as unemployed.  As is statedin our Report of July, 1935, the actual basis adopted was such that,on the rates  of contribution and benefit ultimately embodied in theAct of 1934, the income of the fund would have been just sufficient  842S17                                                   A 2
to meet its liabilities  over a period of years in which the  averagepercentage of unemployment  was 18-1, the  percentage  of  thisunemployment ranking for benefit was 48 - 0 and the average weeklycost per &quot;claim was  858.  The actual rate of unemployment at thetime of the report of the Government Actuary was 18-0.  14. When, at  the beginning of last year, we prepared our Reporton the financial  condition of the fund at the end of 1934, the fundhad accumulated a net balance of  10,527,000.   But the experienceof the working of insurance ou the new basis had been so short, andthe outlook so  uncertain,  that  we felt that  we  should have no justification in coming to a conclusion  that the income of the fund was, and would continue to be, in excess of its liabilities.  We made no recommendation, accordingly, for any change  of  contributionsor benefits.   But in view of the  more favourable prospects of em-pkryment, we announced our intention of  making a further Reportby the middle of 1935.  15. This undertaking was fulfilled in our second Report, signed on the 4th July, 1935.  At  that  time  there had been  an improve-ment in the state of  employment,  as compared with the  firstmonths of the year, and we were advised  byMr. H. D. Hendersonon  behalf  of the Committee  on Economic  Information of  theEconomic Advisory Council that it would be  reasonable to count on a continuance of improvement, at any rate until the end  of 1935,Reviewing the circumstances, we  came to the conclusion that it was reasonable  to base the  finance of the Unemployment Fund uponthe assumption  that  the  average rate of unemployment over aperiod of years in the future would be less than the 18-1 per cent.at which  income and expenditure would balance with  the scales of contribution and benefit adopted in 1934.  We  reported accord-ingly that the Unemployment Fund was, and was likely to continueto be, more  than  reasonably  sufficient to discharge its  liabilities,and  we recommended as a  change required to make  the  fund no more than reasonably sufficient, the raising of the allowance fordependent  children from 2s.  to  3s.  a  week, subject  to a provisolimiting the total benefit to any claimant; the limit  that  we  sug-gested was 41s.  a week.  We estimated that this  recommendationwould increase  the  expenditure of the  Fund by  approximately 1.250,000 a year and that the  balancing point of the fund wouldbe changed thereby from 18-1 to 17-7 per cent, of unemployment.Effect was given  to our  recommendation for  increase  of  thechildren&apos;s allowance,  but  without the  proviso  as  to  total  benefit,bv an Order made  by yourself as  Minister  of Labour  on  25thOctober, 1935.   16. Our second Report and  our proposals, as made in July, wereexpressly provisional.   At the  time of our first Report in  February,1935, we had pointed out that in view  of our responsibility for themaintenance of  unemployment insurance as  a self-supporting social
service, it was necessary, before making assumptions as to the futurerate of unemployment and. acting on them at the risk of, the insur-ance scheme, for us  to  obtain the best advice possible as to thefuture prospects of  unemployment.  We were fortunately enabled to carry out this desire through the willingness of the Economic Advisory Council to make an investiga-tion for us, and to furnish us with their views as to the future trend of  unemployment.   This  investigation  was  undertaken  by  theCouncil&apos;s  Committee  on Economic Information, composed of SirJosiah Stamp (Chairman), Professor A. L. Bowley, Mr. G. D. H.Cole, Mr. H. D. Henderson, Mr.  D.  Caradog Jones,  Mr. J. M.Keynes, Sir Alfred Lewis, Mr. D. H. Robertson, Sir Arthur Salter,and Sir Ernest Simon.  The detailed examination  of the problem was entrusted by the  committee to a  sub-committee composed of four of  its members,  namely,  Mr. Henderson (Chairman),  Pro-professor Bowley, Mr. Caradog Jones, and Mr. Robertson.  This in-investigation has naturally taken  some time to complete.. No resultsarising from it could be available at the time of making our second report, but these results have  how been furnished  to us and formthe basis  of  the proposals which  we make below.  We desire toexpress  our appreciation of the invaluable  help thus given to us.  17. The main results of  the investigation are summed up in. thefollowing statement submitted to us by the Committee on economic information :       &quot; As  the result of these various calculations, we conclude    that the most reasonable working hypothesis to adopt is that the    average percentage of unemployment  among insured persons,    aged 16-64, in Great Britain over the next ten years will be in    the neighbourhood of 15J or 16 per cent.   On the basis of this    hypothesis, however, the average of a shorter  period  such as    eight years would be materially higher; and the corresponding    working hypothesis for the period of a complete trade cycle, i.e.,    between  now and the end of the third year after the next peak    of unemployment, might be placed at 16J or 16f per cent.  We    offer these opinions, subject to the various explanations and   - reserves which  we have, emphasised.  We  have no  confidence,    that is to say, that the averages may not diverge by a substan-    tial amount in  one direction or another from the above levels,    though it seems to us as likely that our estimates will err in    the one direction  as  in the  other.  It is possible that a  radical    change in the outlook  may be brought about by developments    which  it  is now  impossible  to foresee, and it is  important,    therefore, that the working hypotheses which we have suggested    should be regarded as subject to revision in the light of future    developments &quot;.  This statement has  been submitted to us by the Committee onEconomic Information, subject to various explanations and reservessuggested  by the Sub-Committee.  It is to be regarded not as an   34297                                                   A 3
attempt to prophesy but as a contribution, so far as the knowledgenow available permits, to the  formation of a  working hypothesisupon which policy in regard to  the  contributions  and benefits ofthe Unemployment Fund may  reasonably be based.  As the Com-mittee on Economic Information point  out, &quot; among the  factorsby which the course of trade is  influenced is the economic policypursued by the governments of this and of other countries.  Again,any hypothesis would be f ttlsified if the next ten years were to seethe outbreak  of  a major  war or a  financial  collapse of an  un-precedented magnitude, f r on the other  hand by some wholly un-foreseeable improvement in international trade.  Such possibilitiesare clearly too speculative to be taken into account  in drawing up an estimate of the kind which the sub-committee have attempted tomake.&quot;  18. It will be seen that the Committee on Economic Information .have suggested working hypotheses both for ten years and for theperiod of a complete trade cycle, defined as the time &quot; between now and the end of the third year after the next peak  of unemployment.&quot;Of these two periods, for the reasons stated below,  we are  clearlybound to take the latter in estimating the prospects of the fund.Most of the trade and employment cycles of the past have run their course in much less than ten years, and in almost all the calcula-tions  of the Committee  on Economic Information, the ten yearsinclude more than a complete cycle and more than a fair proportionof good years.  This, as well as the assumption, to which we shallrefer later with agreement, that the general trend of unemployment is likely to be downwards, accounts, for the lower percentages sug-gested for  ten years than for a trade  cycle.   In  principle,  theUnemployment Fund should balance over a trade cycle ; where it hasbeen necessary for our calculations to  assume a definite  length forthe next cycle, we have assumed  eight years, beginning with 1936.  19. It will  be  seen, further, that the Committee on economic information refer  to &quot; the next peak of  unemployment &quot; and thatthe mean rates of unemployment suggested by them for a com-plete trade cycle  are materially higher than  the mean percentageof 15-3  per cent,  recorded  in 1935.    In effect the hypothesissuggested by  the  Committee  provides for a substantial  recessionof employment, involving losses  to the  Unemployment Fund, atsome time during the next  five years.  But   for the immediatefuture for this year and probably for next year also the Committeecontemplate improvement on the level of employment reached in1935.  20. For the period of the next  complete cycle the working hypo-thesis suggested to us by  the Committee on Economic Informationplaces the  most probable mean level of  unemployment at 161 Percent, or 16f  per  cent.   This hypothesis reached after  carefulenquiry involves  a view of future prospects more optimistic  than
that which,  without enquiry,  we  felt it  safe to take  as the basisof our second Report last  July.  But in  view both  of the high authority of  the  Committee on Economic Information and of their detailed  analysis  of  the situation, we  feel bound  to  accept their conclusions.   We have prepared accordingly, and set out in the lasttwo  columns of Table I, two estimates of  the prospects  of  theUnemployment Fund, based on applying the adjusted  experienceof 1935  to assumed percentages  of  unemployment of  16-75 and16 - 25 respectively.

Adjustments have also been made  in order that the financial  items mayindicate the position appropriate to current  experience.  f Allowance has been made for increase in the insured population.   21.  In  each case we  have assumed that 48 per cent,  of  the totalunemployment will rank for benefit.   This is a higher proportionthan  the  adjusted  figure of  47-2 for 1935.  But, as is explained in our first report, the  proportion ranking for benefit is practicallycertain to rise substantially with any recession of trade, since thosefalling out of work will, for the most part, be persons with claims   34297                                                      A i
to benefit:  Conversely in a year of recovery, such as 1935, theproportion ranking tends to fall; those who pass from unemploy-ment to employment are predominantly persons on benefit and notthose on assistance.  It would be dangerous to assume any lower figure than 48 per.cent, as the normal proportion for  the future;even 48 per cent, may  prove too low. In the first three months  of1935, with, unemployment averaging just  over 17  per cent., theproportion ranking for  benefit was 49-2 per cent.  22. On the other hand,  our  estimates for the future contain anuncertain but probably substantial margin  of safety, because theyare based on. relating income and  expenditure, spread over thewhole  year  1935,  to an unemployment percentage derived fromtwelve monthly  counts, taken, not in the  middle of each month,but at or near the end of each month. In a year in which thegeneral trend  of unemployment is upwards, counts taken  at themiddle of the month will  give  a lower mean percentage than thatrecorded as  resulting from the actual counts at  the end of each month; the income expenditure experience of the year will corre-spond to that  lower percentage of unemployment, and in relationto the recorded percentage  will give a result that is unduly favour-able.   Conversely, in  a year of diminishing unemployment  like1935, the income and expenditure will correspond to a higher per-centage of unemployment  than that which  is recorded.  Estimatesbased on such  a year  will give results less favourable than thereality.   It is not easy to judge of the importance of this source  of error.  In so far as estimates A and B for  the future are based onthe experience of 1935, each contains a margin of safety, which maybe set against the risk that  the proportion of unemployment rankingfor benefit has been under-estimated.  23. On Estimate A, based on 16-75 per  cent,  of unemployment,the contribution income of the Unemployment Fund  exceeds theexpenditure by  3,588,000  a year.  On Estimate B, based on 16-25per cent, of unemployment, the excess is  5,538,000 a year.  24. As between these two estimates A and B, if the scheme were now starting from  zero, with  no accumulated reserve, it is clearthat we should  have to base its finance on estimate A,  with thehigher rate of unemployment and the smaller resulting surplus.   Amean unemployment percentage of 16-75 per cent, is about as likelyto be realised as any lower percentage.  With no reserves  behindus, and with borrowing powers strictly limited, it would be contraryto every canon of sound finance to assume unemployment below themaximum of the most probable range suggested to us by the Com-mittee  on Economic Information.   That is to say, we could not take as the basis of financial policy, any figure below 16 - 75 as themean  unemployment percentage; in prudence we should probablyfeel driven to take  a  higher figure, for a  higher  figure is  neitherimpossible nor even extremely improbable.s
  25. Fortunately there are two elements in the situation justifying amore optimistic practical conclusion.   In the first place, the Unem-ployment Fund begins the year  1936 with an accumulated reserve of nearly  21,500,000; this will be added to appreciably during thefirst months of 1936, before any  change of contributions or benefitscan become effective.  In the second  place, there is one  element in the  total problem  of unemployment  which in process  of  time we  may expect  to diminish.  This is the  unemployment in ourdepressed  staple  industries coal, cotton,  shipbuilding, shipping.Even though  these are not restored to  prosperity by a revival ofinternational  trade, the  numbers  unemployed  in  them shoulddiminish gradually, as workpeople leave them through retirement,or transfer, and.are not replaced.  Whatever the cyclical fluctuationof employment, there is ground for believing that the general trend of unemployment  will be downwards; each successive fluctuationshould take place  at a lower level.  Even if the  mean unemploy-ment percentage  of the next eight years is  16-75  or more, theunemployment of the eight years  following should  be  materiallyless.  26. In these circumstances, it appears justifiable to treat theincome of the fund as sufficient for  its liabilities, not on the  basisof  balancing  income  and expenditure if unemployment  averages16-75 per cent, from 1936 to 1943, but on the basis of using up inthat period the bulk of our accumulated reserve.  As appears  fromTable I, with unemployment averaging 16-75 per cent., the income of the Unemployment Fund,  at  the existing  rates of contribution and benefit, should exceed the expenditure by nearly  3,600,000 ayear.  If, in  addition,  the  whole of  the accumulated  reserves ofapproximately  21,500,000  were to be  exhausted in eight years,this would allow  additional expenditure or reduction of income atthe rate of nearly  2,700,000 a year making a total of somethingunder   6,300,000 a year.  This  calculation  takes  no  account of receipts of interest on the balances now held by the Fund, and likelyto  be  held  for some time, and  it assumes  that changes  of con-tribution or benefit are made as  from the beginning of 1936, while,for administrative  reasons it  is  unlikely that they  can  be made immediately.  Allowing for these two  facts, and on the other  hand for the undesirability of completely  exhausting  the reserve, weconclude that the disposal surplus of  the Unemployment fund should be put at something under, but  approaching,  6,500,000 ayear.  27. This conclusion depends upon three principal conditions :        (1)  That the mean unemployment percentage over  the next     eight years is not above the 16 - 75 per cent, given by the Com-     mittee on Economic Information as the maximum  of the most     probable  range of unemployment for a complete trade cycle,     and that  after that period the mean unemployment percentage     is 16-0 or less.H4-297
  :   -  (2)  That as anticipated by the Committee on Economic Tn-    f or ma tion, recovery  of  trade  and  decline of unemployment    continue at least till the latter part of 1937.       (3)  That our estimate of 48 per  cent, as the proportion  of    unemployment ranking for  benefit is not exceeded. .  If any of  these three  conditions  fails  to be  satisfied, withouta compensating improvement in some other direction, it will become necessary to retrace in whole or in part,  any steps which may havebeen taken this year by way of reducing  contributions  or increasingbenefits.  It may be desirable to say something more in explanation of each of  the three conditions  named above.  28. First, in proposing to decrease the income or increase the ex-penditure of the Unemployment Eund byr nearly  6,500,000 a year,we  make the balancing point  of the Fund just over 16-0 per cent.of unemployment, as compared  with  18-1 per cent, on the originalbasis of 1934,  and 17-7 per cent, at present (since the raising  ofbenefit to dependent  children).  On the assumption of  16-75 percent,  of unemployment in the  next  eight 3rears the Fund  at theend of that time wiil show a small balance; if unemployment aver-ages appreciably more than 16-75 per cent, the Fund will have a deficit.  After  the present reserve is exhausted, the Fund canremain solvent only if the mean unemployment is at or below thenew balancing point of 16-0 per cent.  29. Second,  the solvency of the Fund  depends  not only  on itsbalancing over a period of j^ears.  It must also be in  a position  atall  times to meet  the  losses involved in a depression, without ex-ceeding its  limited borrowing powers.   In our earlier reports accord-ingly,  we discussed not only the balancing point of the Fund, butalso the reserve which we should aim at accumulating in advance to deal with periods of depression.  As a  rough guide to the scale of the reserve that might  be needed, we adopted as/&quot; standardreserve &quot; half the total loss that would be incurred (on any givenbasis of contributions and benefits) in the worst depression yet ex-ineperienced, that of 1930-1933.   As we stated in our earlier reports,the  choice  of  this &quot; standard  reserve &quot;  was  entirely provisional and it  now seems  possible and preferable to approach the  questionof  keeping an adequate  reserve for contingencies from  anotherangle.   In  assuming  a mean rate of unemployment  for the nexteight years namely  16-75 per cent. we have in effect  assumedalso a  succession of unemployment percentages for individual years some above the mean and others below  it, and in the light of these assumptions we can estimate the nett surpluses and nett losses thatwould  be made in  each year by the Unemployment Fund.   In orderto feel  assured that over a given period of years the Fund will remainsolvent, on any  given basis  of contributions  and  benefits, it  isnecessary, therefore, to assume  also that the order of good and badyears respectively  will be  such that the Fund will never be in debt
for more than two years together, since repayment out of income of sums borrowed must be commenced within this period and must becompleted within the third year.   On the views expressed to us bythe Committee on Economic Information it is reasonable to hopethat this will be accomplished, but it is most unlikely to be accorn-plished, if  in  the next two years  we are unable to add very sub-stantially to the present reserves- of  the  Unemployment Fund.  Ifduring the year 1936, unemployment, allowing  for seasonal fluc-tuations, remains at the  general level of 14-1 per cent, reached inDecember, 1935, the income of  the  Fund will exceed its  expendi-ture,  even  after  the changes which we propose below,  and thepresent reserve of the Fund will rise substantially.  But,  unless there is then ground for taking  a different view than now of laterprospects, this will not be a reason for assuming that the Fund has afurther disposable surplus.  With the  existing contributions  and benefits,  the income of the Unemployment Fund in 1936 is prac-tically certain  to exceed  the expenditure, not by  3,588,000 shownat the foot  of Table I as  the average  of the next eight years, but bya much larger amount.   On the hypothesis offered to  us by theCommittee on  Economic Information,  we  shall,  during 1936, bein a relatively  favourable period of  the  trade  cycle and  surplusesaccumulated in that period will be  required, in part at least, tocover the losses of less favourable years to come.  30. Third,  as regards  the proportion of unemployment rankingfor benefit, the figure of  48 per cent, assumed above seems reason-able, at existing levels of  unemployment, and having regard to othermargins of  safety in our  calculations.  But the further assumptionwhich we make-of an ultimate decline from present levels of unein-ployment through contraction of numbers in the depressed industries involves also the probability that the  proportion of unemploymentranking for benefit  will rise;  the  exceptional unemployment inthose industries is now  covered largely  by assistance and not bybenefit.  After the period contemplated in our present calculation,we should  look forward to a time  when the proportion rankingwould be materially  above 48 per cent. ; for solvency in that case,the total unemployment  would have  to be not  &quot;  16-0 per cent, orless &quot;, as suggested in paragraph 27, but definitely less  than 16per cent.  It may be added that budgeting for exhausting the bulkof the present reserve in the next eight years or  any other period,involves assuming that at the end of the period, whatever may have happened in the  interval,  unemployment will be falling, so thata fresh reserve-is being formed.  We mention-these points to illus-trate the conditions of our work.  It would clearly be unprofitableto discuss them at any length.  Before  the current trade cycle is completed,  both the scheme itself and economic conditions may havealtered many  times, and the needle may have, swung repeatedlybetween optimism and pessimism in our outlook.
                      Disposal of Surplus:  31. In the light of the conclusion reached above, it becomes our duty  to  make recommendations for the  disposal of  an annualsurplus of  about   6,500,000 a year.   This is  a large sum, repre-senting about 10  per cent,  of the contribution income of the Fund,and 15 per cent,  of its present expenditure on benefits.  It may be convenient to preface our discussion  of alternatives by a tabularstatement  of  the annual  cost involved in  each of the  principalchanges that  have been proposed as  to contributions  or benefits.The table is  based on the assumed mean insured population of thenext  eight years  and the assumed mean rate  of unemployment.For  these reasons the figures differ a little  from the correspondingestimates given in our first Report; they cover also a larger variety of possible  changes. .TABLE II.

We begin by naming two possible uses of the surplus which,for the reasons stated below, we rule out of consideration.  33. In the first place, it is open to us, under the proviso to sec-tion 60 (2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, to recom-mend that any  surplus of  the  Unemployment Fund should be de-voted to paying off  the funded  debt  of  the Fund more rapidly than could  be  accomplished by  the  statutory  debt   charge
                               isof  ,- 5,000,000  a  year.  we might,  for  instance,  recommendthat , the  whole  of  the  accumulated  reserve  , (apart  from, asmall  balance  for   contingencies),  say   21   millions,  should at  once  be  applied  to  the extinction of the debt  and   thatthe annual  surplus  of  about   3,500,000 which, on  an averagewe anticipate  for the next eight years, even on the assumption ofan  unemployment percentage  of  1.6-75, should be devoted to  thesame purpose.  If that were  done, extinction  of the  debt  wouldbe  accelerated, not only directly, but also indirectly,  because  theburden  of  interest would be lessened and a larger  proportion ofthe fixed debt charge would  become available  for repayment ofthe principal.   Bight  years  from now the remaining  debt  wouldbe  not   91,500,000  but  37,500,000, and if  the additional pay-ments of  3,500,000 were continued, the debt would be extinguishedin 1948.  Even  if no payments additional to the  fixed  debt-chargewere  made  after 1943, the  debt would  be finally extinguished inthe year 1952 in place of 1971 as now contemplated.  We give thesefigures to indicate how considerable are the changes which it is inour power  to propose in the finance of the insurance scheme.   Ona reasonable estimate as to  the future trend of unemployment,  the debt of over  100 millions, which loomed so large  in the discussions of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme one or two years ago, could now be  extinguished in little more than 12 years.   Bor the insuredpersons, and other contributors, the way would then be open both toa material increase of benefits and to a lowering of contributions,even if unemployment remained at its present level.  But this gainto future  contributors and beneficiaries would have been  obtained at the cost of  keeping the contributions and benefits of the presentcontributors unchanged.   The present generation of  contributorsare; already meeting  the  statutory  charge of   5 millions a- yearto extinguish  a debt incurred between 1922 and 1932.  We do  notthink that they need be called on to continue paying at  the existing rates, in order to make matters so, much easier for a future genera-tion who, we  may hope, will in any case have a smaller burden ofunemployment to bear.  We do not recommend in this report thatany part, either, of the accumulated reserve, or of the prospectiveannual surpluses, should be used for additional repayment of debt. . 34. In the second place, it is within our powers  to propose an ex-tension  of  the period of benefit, so  as to  cover by benefit, ratherthan by assistance, a larger proportion of the total unemployment.Broadly speaking, an increase  of  1  per cent, in the  proportion oftotal  unemployment  covered by benefit costs  the UnemploymentFund an  additional   1,000,000 a year.   It would,  therefore, bepossible for us now to recommend such a lengthening of the period for benefit or  such changes in the  conditions as would  raise  theproportion  of  unemployment ranking for benefit, from the 48  percent assumed  in our  calculation, to 54 or 55 per cent.  In  effect,on  the  present figures, this would  transfer  nearly 140,000  work-people from receipt of assistance to drawing of benefit.
   35. In so  far as it  is an advantage for the individual workman to get benefit rather than assistance,  this would  be  a step in the right direction.   And, from a financial point of view, extension of the period of benefit is the line of greatest safety  in disposing of a prospective surplus.  If, through  any error  in  calculation or  any worsening of economic  conditions, the prospective surplus is not realised, the period of benefit can be shortened again, at  the cost of the National Exchequer,  with  less disturbance than would be involved  either in  raising  contributions  or  in  lowering  rates of benefit.   As against this, it should be pointed out that extending the period of benefit means maintaining insurance contributions at their present level, in direct relief of general taxation.   The contri- butions of employers and workpeople for social insurance are a tax on  employment,  and, considered  in  that  light alone, are a less desirable  means of raising revenue than are most other  forms of taxation.   Prom  this point of view, use of a  surplus in the Unem- ployment Fund to extend further the period of benefit and diminish the cost of assistance is a step in the wrong direction..  36. The question  cannot, of course, be considered only from the point of view of taxation.  What proportion of the total unemploy- ment, and what types of unemployment, should be covered by in- surance benefit, and what should be dealt  with in  other ways, is a broad issue of national policy; the social advantage of  providing for unemployment  on the principles of insurance rather than of relief must at all times be weighed  against the fiscal disadvantage of pro- viding  for it by  a  relatively  undesirable  form  of taxation.  Forminor adjustments in the finance of the insurance scheme, variation of the  benefit period is the most flexible method  available.  And,if  at any time a further  surplus  were available, we  should  not exclude investigation of the need for extending the  period of benefit or easing the conditions for re-qualification of men who have run through  their  claims.   In  the  circumstances of  to-day, havingregard, on the one hand, to the high rate of the tax on employment now imposed for insurance and, on the other hand, to  the degree to which  normal unemployment  outside  the special  areas is already covered by insurance,  we do  not believe that transference of men from assistance to benefit, in relief of the National Exchequer is the best use  of  the  surplus  of the Unemployment Fund that  is  in prospect.   We  make no recommendation  in  this report for exten- sion of the period of benefit.  37. Excluding the two possibilities of paying off debt, and extend- ing the period of benefit, we  have  to  consider broadly the  alterna-tives of devoting the annual surplus predominantly or solely to reduc- tion of contributions, and of devoting  the surplus predominantly or solely to increasing  the  rates  of benefit.   The first of these  alter- natives  was  urged  on us by  the National Confederation  of Em- ployers&apos; Organisations; the  second alternative was urged on us by
the representatives of the Trades Union Congress General Council,and was supported, though with emphasis on the need of keepingan adequate reserve against depression, on behalf of the Parliament-ary Committee of the Co-operative Congress and  the Co-operativeUnion.   All these bodies had appeared before us to speak in thesame sense in June when we were preparing our second Report.  38.  There is, of course, a third possibility that of  compromisingbetween the principal alternatives already named and combiningreduction of contributions with increase of benefits.   And there aretwo special points on which we have had representations from bodiesother  than those named  above.   One of these points  relates to theposition  of  women contributors under unemployment insurance;the other to the waiting time  of six days  before benefit begins.Each of these special points is dealt with below.   It will be desirableto begin by considering the  main issue.  39.  The  choice  between  reducing  contributions and  improvingbenefits, though it has a financial aspect, is in the main one of public policy.   Comparing small things with great, we are in the positionof the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who, when increasing prosperitygives him a prospective surplus on the national budget, has to choose between a  remission  of taxation and additional expenditure.   the choice,  we need hardly say, is a difficult one.  And though the re-sponsibility for final decision rests not with us but with the Govern-ment  and Parliament, we are required to make a definite recom-mendation.   The  Minister  of Labour, if he does not accept our recommendation, is required to  give  his  reasons for  not  doing so.In view of the importance of the issues involved it seems  desirable,as a first step, to set out the general arguments on each side  ofthe question.  40.  The  reasons that may be urged for giving first place to reduc-tion of contributions are as  follows :   First, the rates of contribution now in force are  those establishedby the  National  Economy  Act  in the emergency of 1931;  their introduction was accompanied by reductions in the rates of benefit.In order to make insurance solvent, 3d. a week was added to the contribution of each insured person aged 18 to 64, 2d. to that of hisor her employer, and 2Jd.  to that of the State,  with smaller in-creases for juveniles ; all the rates of benefit were lowered by roughly10 per cent.   In 1934 the rates of benefit ruling before  the emer-gency of 1931 were restored; at the same time, by extension of theperiod  of benefit,  a  slightly larger proportion  of  the total unem-ployment was covered by benefit.  In the light of the unemploy-ment situation at that time, the  Government Actuary reported thatcontinuance of the rates of contribution  introduced  in  1931 wasnecesary to cover the liabilities of the Unemployment Fund on itsnew basis, and these contributions were continued. It  may be
argued that the Act of 1934 must be accepted as a fresh Parlia-mentary settlement of  contributions.  But if, in 1934, the Govern-ment Actuary had reported, as  we report now, that rates of contri-bution at the National Economy Act level were substantially  morethan sufficient to cover restoration of benefit rates and the extensionof period proposed, it is hard to believe that those rates would havebeen continued, without reduction, in order to raise the general ratesof benefit above the level of September, 1931.  In this connection,theNational Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations pointed outthat,  so far as they were aware, &quot; the only emergency measure of1931 which has so far not been removed or even alleviated is theincrease of Unemployment Insurance  Contributions &quot;.    At thesame time  they brought to our notice a  statement  made by theMinister of Labour on the Third Beading of the Unemployment Billon 14th May, 1934, as follows :        &quot; We  have devised  an expeditious method of  securing that    the adantages of a surplus  may be enjoyed by the contributors    as soon as possible, subject to  the approval of Parliament.  No    one who knows  anything about this matter can for a moment    be oblivious  of  the  great  burden which the existing  rate of    contribution imposes on both industry and the contributors, and    I have no doubt that the Statutory Committee, should  they    find themselves in the position of having to deal with a surplus,    will  consider the possibility  of a  reduction in the  rate of    contributions &quot;.  This statement, they argued, showed that the Government, whileit did not reduce the  emergency contributions at that time, regarded&apos;those rates as temporary and as calling for reduction when circum-stances allowed.  41. Second, the employers&apos; and workers&apos; contributions for social insurance are now at a level making them a very sensible burden on industry.   In response to a request for information as to the weightof contributions in particular industries, the National  confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations   submitted  statements  in  regard to coal-mining,  shipbuilding  and textiles.   In coal-mining, during1934, the  employers&apos;  and  workers&apos; payments for  unemployment,health and pensions, workmen&apos;s compensation and miners&apos;, welfare,represented llfd. per  ton or 8-5 per cent, of the net value of theoutput, given as 11s.  6d.  per  ton.  The  employers&apos;  share of the 8-5  per cent, was 5-7 per cent.   In shipbuilding, the employers&apos;and  workmen&apos;s total  contribution was  6-2 per cent, of  the net output, and  the  employers&apos; share alone was  3-8 per  cent.   Ebrcotton the  corresponding figures were 6 per cent, and 3J  per cent. ;for wool they were nearly 4 per cent, and over 2 per cent.   42.  These  percentages cover all  forms  of social  insurance and compensation for accidents. Only  part of them is attributable  to unemployment insurance and a reduction of Id.  a week  from each
 party  would  mean-a reduction  of  about one-tenth of that part. Looked  at  from the point of view of the individual workman,  a saving of  this order of magnitude may  seem unimportant; but, looked at as a whole, reduction of contributions by Id. a week all round would  be  a substantial benefit.   In effect such a reduction would lower the contributions of each of the three parties to  the insurance  scheme by about  2,150,000 immediately,  and a little more  later,  as  the insured population rose.   The  State&apos;s share,  2,150,000, would be a relief of general taxation; the employers&apos;  2,150,000 would  be a lowering of costs of production  by that amount; and the workmen&apos;s   2,150,000 would represent a raising of wages by that  amount, that is to say by just over  40,000 a week. In this connection it may be pointed out  that  all the  additions to wages made in the year 1935 a time of improving trade amounted to a total  net weekly increase of about  1S7,500, and  that  in no year since 1924 had there been an increase  as large as this.   Eeduc- ticm of  Id. in contributions  would,  at one stroke give to wage- earners more than one-fifth of all their gains by  wage increases during 1935.   43.  What would be  the  ultimate incidence of these  changes it is impossible to say,  since this depends on the  bargaining  position of the various parties; this would  not be the same for all indus- tries.  The workmen might not  find   it  in  all cases  possible to keep their addition  to  wages. The  employers&apos;  immediate saving on costs  might in some cases  be kept by them as profits, in others be surrendered to the workmen as  addition to wages, in others be passed on  to  consumers  in  lower prices,  with  the  result pre- sumably  of increasing demand.  Just  how a change of contribu- tions will  work   out in each  case depends upon  the   circum- stances in which  it is made.   But in general terms, the employers&apos; and  workmen&apos;s  contributions  to social  insurance, made in  respect of each week  of  employment, are a tax on employment.  Exactly how much effect a small reduction of this tax  would have in en- ecouraging employment, it is impossible  to say.   But that  it  must have some  effect, is on general  principles undeniable.  At  their present level, employers&apos;  and workpeople&apos;s contributions  for  all the various  forms of insurance are  a sensible burden o.n industry; within the  past  few  weeks the burden  has been  increased  by additional contributions  required  for pensions.  44. Third, reduction  of  contributions is a  safer method of ab- sorbing a prospective surplus  than  raising the rate of  benefit can ever  be.   The calculations on  which  the   assumed  surplus of 6,500,000 a year is based are speculative in the extreme.  Ex-jiectations of  a  surplus  may  be  defeated  at  any moment  by anunexpected  turn  of  events,  or, by experience over  a period  ofyears,  may  be proved over-sanguine.   There is  grave  danger  in adopting  now any  course  of  action which cannot  readily  be re-traced, if the  calculations are falsified.   As has been pointed out
 above, the most  easily retraceable. means, of absorbing a  surplus is extension of the period of benefit.  The least retraceable  is a raising of the general rate of benefit;,.variation of contributions. occupies .a., middle  position.   To raise the rates, of contributions in a time of declining trade  is undesirable, if  it can  be  avoided. But the  difficulties of such  a course are of a  different order  of importance  from those involved in  lowering the  income of the unemployed at  a  time . of  exceptional  unemployment;   broadly speaking,  the longer  an  individual has  been  unemployed, the greater his  need for  benefit  or assistance, because his other re- sources  will  have  been exhausted.    The extreme difficulty  of lowering  benefits again, once they had been  raised,  was recog- nised  by. some at least of those  who appeared before the Com- mittee to advocate higher benefits.   They agreed that, if,  through unfavourable economic developments, raising benefits now  resulted in a deficit  later, the position  would have to  be met by raising contributions further; they  felt certain  that  the workpeople,. at least,  would make no objection  to  such  a  course.  Adjustment of the insurance  scheme to unfavourable changes must be sought almost inevitably either in reducing the period of  benefit, so  as to transfer men from insurance to  assistance,  or in raising  con- tributions.   45.  From this point of view  there is  special  importance  in getting contributions, if possible,  below their present level-the level  fixed in the emergency of 1931.  There would  not be the same  difficulty in putting  them back again to  that point, if the expectations of a surplus  were falsified, as in putting  them above the emergency  level.  From this point   of  view also,  it is not possible to regard any reduction of unemployment  insurance  con- tributions now as a direct  compensation for the recent increase  of pension contributions.  The  Statutory Committe must be free  to recommend  raising of the unemployment  insurance contributions again if  circumstances require that.   But the pensions   increase is a ground for  avoiding or reducing any other present burden  on industry  whose  necessity cannot be  proved.   46. Fourth, regarding any increase in the rates  of  benefit now as likely to be  permanent,  it is appropriate to look at  social  in- surance as a whole, and to  compare the statutory  provision made for loss  of  earnings  through unemployment  with the provision made for loss of earnings through sickness.   The  standard  rates of  sickness  benefit,   under   the  Health  Insurance scheme,   are 15s.  a week  for men, 12s.  for single women and widows, and 10s. for  married women;  Approved  Societies  with a surplus can add to these rates.   At  the  present  time about  a third of  the insured men get additional sickness benefit.of 5s. or,slightly  more or  slightly less; another  third  get smaller additions ranging  from Is. to 3s. 6d.,  and nearly  a third get no addition;  the average addition, over  all  insured  men, is just above  2s. 6d.   a  week.
-There are no allowances for dependents.  Speaking broadly, sick-mess  benefit for men ranges to        to 20s. a  week,  with an average of 17s. 6d., whether they  are married or  single and how- ever  large or  small  the  number of dependentsamong women contributors three-quarters get the standard rate.of. 10s.  or 12s. without  addition;  the remainder get  additional  benefits, which seldom exceed 3s.;  the  average addition  over all insured women is about  9d.  a week.  As compared with  this,  the unemployed man  gets 17s. a week if  single, 26s. if married,  and larger sums if he  has children;   at the  present time there  are about  7,500 unemployed men,  with  six or more dependent  children, receiv- ing benefit  of 44s. to 53s.  a week.   Including allowances,  the average, rate of weekly benefit to adult men, single or  married, is.24s. 6d. a week when unemployed as compared  with  an average of 17s. 6d.  a week   in  sickness.   The  average.rate  for  adult women  is  15s.  ljd.  when  unemployment^ed   as   compared  with 12s. 9d.  or  10s. 9d.  a week  in sickness.  A  substantial propor- tion,  no doubt, of  those covered by  compulsory health  insurance, are able to draw supplementary benefits in  sickness, because they are insured  also in Friendly  Societies  or other  organisations for voluntary saving.  But the  same possibility of supplementary in- surance applies to  unemployment, and is taken  advantage  of by many  workmen, though   to   a  less  extent  than with   health; facilitating and  encouraging   supplementary  insurance  through trade  unions  and other  associations has. always  been a  principle of  the compulsory  scheme.    Neither for  sickness  nor  for  un- employment  was  compulsory insurance,  when  introduced,  de- signed as a complete provision,  making any kind of voluntary provision  for emergencies, either individually or through  societies, unnecessary.   The  statutory provision  for  unemployment&apos; is already  on a substantially higher  scale than that for  sickness ;  it  approaches in many  cases the level of, wages  and  in  some cases may surpass wages.  This  comparison  does not  imply  a judgment  that  the rates  of  sickness benefit  are  too  low, in relation to  need, and certainly  not that  they are low  in  relation to the contributions charged.   But there  are  obvious  dangers in  having  the benefit rates for unemployment and for sickness at widely  differing levels, as there  are  dangers in  making the  compensation for loss  of wages in  any particular case equal to or greater than wages.  Any increase of  unemployment  benefit rates in general should now be made  only, after  full  consideration  by Parliament,  as an  act of  deliberate ^social policy,  and not simply because  a  decline of unemployment has -produced   a   surplus in  the   Unemployment Fund.  &apos;                          . &apos;  &apos;   ;--&apos;V.&apos;-;    -       -   47.  ;Such  are&apos;  the  general arguments in favour ,of treating  the present occasion as  one  for  reduction of- contributions.   . - The arguments that may be urged on the other.side are.as  follows.
  48. First, MI addition to the rate of. benefit paid to.an unern-ployed person  meets urgent  felt  needs; an  extra penny  to the workman when employed, or to the employer, will hardly be feltat all.  (Whatever be said as to the harmfulness of insurance con-tributions, as  a tax on employment, the fact remains that thosepaying the tax have  got used to it and have  adjusted themselvesto it, as people usually adjust themselves to any  well-establishedtax.    &quot; An old tax,&quot; it  is often said &quot; is  no tax.&quot;  Even the extra penny  for pensions  has just  been paid practically  withoutprotest.    There have been no representations  from the  side ofthe employees  in favour of  reducing contributions for unemploy-ment.    The employers may be able to show that the total con-tributions for all social services (health, unemployment, pensions,accidents) are an appreciable percentage of  their costs, but this isirrevelant  to  the practical  issue.   There is  no question  of re-moving all contributions;  all that is at issue is one tenth of thecharge for unemployment  alone.   It is hard  to believe that Id.a week off the  employer&apos;s contribution  43 in a ship on whichthe  shipbuilders  direct  costs are   33,300 or even  100 in,histotal costs of  90,000! would make  any difference to the  volumeof employment or to his chances  of getting a contract.  To takeId. off the contribution would cost practically the  same as adding3s.  a week to all adult benefits; can it be doubted that the latteruse would give more general satisfaction?  49. Second,  the position of the  Statutay  Committee  in  respectof insurance is not like that of a  Chancellor  of  the Exchequer inrespect of his  budget.   The  Chancellor can remit taxation  oneyear, with the knowledge that if he wants  to make an  extension,whether  of social services or of  national defence, later, he  canpropose to put  the taxes on again.    The Statutory Committee,if they reduce  contributions now,  cannot raise them again, except to meet   a  deficit.    In  reducing  contributions,  the  Committeegive . up   power  to  make  changes  in the  , scheme which  laterexperience or  further investigation may show  to he required.   in fixing the amount  of  the disposable surplus,  the  Committee  willhave taken into account all the resources on which they can countfor the next eight years, and, failing an unexpected improvementof trade, will have excluded any improvement of benefits in thatperiod.  50. Third, the present  moment  is particularly inopportune forsurrendering  income  from  the Unemployment Fund,  because theCommittee have no information as to  the  probable policy of theUnemployment  Assistance  Board.   One  of  the  reasons whichprompted  the  Committee  to  propose  an  increase of  children&apos;benefit last July, was the  desire of reducing as much as  possibleany occasion for  supplementing benefit  to large families, either Ibyunemployment  assistance or by public assistance.  When the new
scales of unemployment assistance are published and applied, theremay prove to be other types of claimant for whom an increase ofbenefit  is equally  desirable to  avoid  supplementation.    But, ifcontributions have been  reduced, the Committee will not be in aposition to make any change of benefits.  51. In the foregoing paragraphs we  have set out  as  fairly  andforcibly as we can the arguments that may be advanced  on each side  of the general  issue, between reducing  contributions  and improving  benefits.    Before expressing out own view of thosearguments, it  will be convenient to discuss three minor issues.  52. There is,  first, the position  of women contributors.    Thearguments addressed  to  us last June by  a group of associationsconcerned with  the  interests  of women,  are  summarised in  oursecond report in the following terms :-       &quot; These  associations  argued that the insurance scheme, as    it  stands, is unfair to women in several respects.   First, the    contribution paid by adult  women is  nine-tenths of the con-    tribution paid by  adult men, but  the  weekly rate  of benefit    is  only 15s. against  17s.  a smaller proportion.    Second, the    average rate of unemployment  among women  is  less  than    among men, but women  are not given the advantage of  this    lower liability to unemployment; on the other hand, in health    insurance,  their  greater  liability  to  sickness is  taken  into    account in  fixing their  contributions   and  benefits.   Third,    men in addition to their  higher rate of benefit draw  a larger    share of the benefit for  dependants; the average weekly  cost    of  a  man&apos;s claim is higher than  that of  a  woman&apos;s claim.    Fourth, a further  discrimination is imposed by the  Anomalies    Order depriving large numbers  of women  on  marriage of  any    chance of benefiting by their contributions.   The associations    making these representations suggested, as a first step towards    greater equality of treatment between the sexes, the raising    of  the weekly  rate of  benefit  to women;  they  submitted    reasons for  holding  that the needs of  single women were not    substantially less than those of men,  and were  certainly not    less in the proportion 15 to 17.&quot;  The facts stated  above,  as  we observed in our Report  of July,appear  to  be  formally undeniable.    In considering them, how-ever,  the considerations  set out in the following paragraphs mustbe borne  in mind.  53. It is true that&apos; the weekly rate of benefit that can be drawnby women, is now less  than in proportion  to the weekly rate of contribution.   A  strict  proportion would make  the  women&apos;benefit 15s. 3^d. as compared with 17s. for men, but  strict  pro-portion has never  been observed  in  the  past and for  practical reasons is almost impossible to achieve, so long as any differenceat all  is  maintained  between the  sexes.    Contributions  can be
adjusted  only by  halfpennies,  while payment of  weekly benefit by  anything bat  even shillings (or at the  worst sixpences)  is extremely inconvenient.    As  rates of benefit  and contributions have varied  during the past 15 years to meet changes of financial conditions or social  policy,  the  actual rate  of  women&apos;s benefithas, at times, been  as much as Is. above parity,  (that is to sayabove the hypothetical rate which would  make  it  strictly propor-tionate to their contribution), and at  other times has been as muchas lOd. below parity.   In the fifteen years as a whole women have gained much more than they have  lost.    Before  the emergencyof 1931, the rates  of benefits were the same as at present but thecontributions required  were 7d. from men  and  6d. from women,and  the  women&apos;s benefit  was 5d.  above  parity.   It  has beenbrought below  parity  only  by the  equal  addition of 3d. to thecontributions.  The resulting deficiency of  3Jd. a week is almost the smallest  discrepancy in the history of  the insurance scheme,and would be reduced automatically  to ljd. a week, if the contri-butions were reduced again by Id.  54. It  is  true, again,  that the average rate  of  unemployment among women  contributors as a whole is  less  than  among menas a whole,  and that women are not given the advantage of thislower risk of unemployment.   Exactly  the same,  however, holdstrue of all other classes of  contributors in  the general scheme  ofunemployment insurance.   In that scheme, all workpeople  of thesame age and sex class pay the same  contribution irrespective  oftheir  risk of unemployment, though  the  risk varies from  oneindustry  to  another  and  from  one  individual to  another; there appears to be no  reason why women  should have the benefit  oftheir lower risk  of unemployment any more than any other classof insured person.   They  are certainly not  separate from the restof employed persons in  the sense  that agricultural  workers areseparate.   The greater degree  of unemployment  among men as awhole  is  to  a large extent an industrial phenomenon, due to thefact  that, apart from textiles, the specially depressed  occupationssuch as  coalmining,  shipbuilding, . and shipping  have  very  fewwomen  in  them;  while   the  relatively   prosperous  occupationsconnected with distribution have large numbers of women.    Itshould be added that  though the total rate of unemployment amongmen is a good deal greater than among women (21.6  per cent,  asagainst 13.7  per cent,  during the period 1930 to  1935 inclusive),there is  no  marked  difference  between the percentages drawingbenefit.   The limitations on the period for which benefit can bedrawn exclude a much larger proportion of men than of womenamong the unemployed.   The percentage of insured persons whoare able  to  draw  benefit  is much the same for  the two sexes: 8.2 for men  as against 6.9  for women.  55. It  is  true,  again,  that  dependants&apos;  benefit is paid pre-dominantly  to unemployed men,  rather  than  to   unemployedwomen.  But it is paid in respect of a wife and children for whose
maintenance the unemployed man is liable.   It is  reasonable to look at the insurance scheme as a whole and to treat the contribu-tions of women in employment as available, with the contributions of all other employed persons, to help in securing  themselves andtheir children against economic insecurity if and when  they marryand  give up earning.  56. It is true,  finally, that the Anomalies Orders impose special conditons  on the receipt of benefit by  married women.  This is part of  the  policy  of  the  insurance  scheme   as approved byParliament, and  we have given reasons in our second Report for holding that reconsideration of that policy falls outside  the naturalsphere of financial reports.   It would, therefore, be  inappropriate for us here, without consideration, to express any opinion on the merits  of the Anomalies Orders.  It can only be  said, as  is saidabove, in regard to dependants&apos; benefit, that the Insurance scheme must be  looked at as a whole.  Any provision in it which  is held to be necessary to prevent an uneconomical diversion of benefit toany  class of  persons has  the effect of increasing the  resources available for all  other contributors, for  women  as for men,  andfor women in their capacity of married  dependants as for women in employment and  unemployment.  57. The  case  for  a relative improvement  of benefit to womencontributors  cannot  fairly  be rested on  any  of  the argumentsexamined above.   The  relevant real  issue is  whether  the rate of15s.  a  week  for  single  women  represents  a  provision  for themcomparable to that represented by 17s. a week in the case of singlemen ; and whether on grounds of social policy it would be desirableto pay a larger benefit to unemployed  women,  even  at the costof exacting, if necessary, a larger relative contribution.   This isa matter on which,  on  the  informa/fcion  at present  before us, it isdifficult to  come to a definite  conclusion.  58. If  the question be approached from the standpoint  of needs,it might be difficult  to  show that the needs of single  women areas much as 2s.  a week below those of  single men;  many people would  say  that  the  needs  are substantially  equal.  further enquiry on this point  is required, but would  leave unsettled thequestion  of how far insurance benefits (as distinct from assistance)should  be determined by need or should aim at  being  a completeprovision.  If, on the other hand, the question be approached  fromthe standpoint of  parity  between rates of  contributions and benefits,it must be noted that the present discrepancy  of  3Jd. a week isalmost the lowest in the history  of the scheme; the  discrepancywould be reduced still further by taking Id.  off the  contributions of men and women  alike.  Complete parity could  be  obtained in another way,  by  taking Id. off  the  men&apos;s contributions only  and adding 2s. to the women&apos;s benefit, so as  to make contributions and benefits the  same for both sexes.   Such a proposal cannot  be
                               2ff ruled out, without consideration.   But it would mean a  notable change from former policies in social insurance; having regard to the differences of wage level between men and women it would seem anomalous to many people to  exact  the  same contributions aiid to  give the same compensation for loss of  wages.   59. There is, second, the proposal made to us by, the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Movement,  that the  waiting  time of 1 six days before benefit is  payable should be abolished, so that benefit would be paid from the beginning of unemployment,;or, if that is not possible, that the waiting time  should be  reduced  in  length. A waiting time have  been part of  the scheme of unemployment insurance from  the beginning,  and  has been maintained  through all its other changes, though, for two short periods beginning 1920 and 1924, the length of the  waiting time was three days, in place of  six  days as  at  present.   60. The question of abolishing or reducing the waiting time was considered by the  Departmental  Committee  under Lord  Blanes- burgh  in 1925  and by the Eoyal Commission  on  Unemployment Insurance  in  1932.    Both of  these  bodies reported  in  favour of maintaining the provision unchanged.  The  general ground on which- a waiting time  appears to be justified is that the  first week of a period of unemployment is  a  period which the individual may fairly be left  to cover by his own resources.    Any given sum available for relief of unemployment will meet more urgent needs, if nothing is given for the first  week, for  which many workmen will have wages in hand,  and if more is spent at the other end of unemployment  in  lengthening the period of benefit.   For  this  or for other reasons,  the  use of. a  waiting time  was and is common among trade unions in administering then own schemes of benefit, and the plan  was copied from  them in  the original  scheme  of unemployment insurance of 1911.  Since that time, the proportion of unemployment falling into the waiting time and so not  covered by  benefit, has been reduced by changes in the continuity rules,that is to say, in the rules linking together periods of unemployment separated by short intervals of work,  so as  to require one waiting time only.  To-day a  waiting time follows only on a substantial period of employment, which can practically never be  less than ten weeks ana usually  is much more.  61. In the circumstances  set out  above  it appears to most of us that  there is  no ground for regarding abolition or reduction ofthe waiting period as a  change for  which any urgency  can be claimed.  In regard to women there is, we think, a case for further enquiry as to the most appropriate rate of benefit,  but in the. viewof most  of us,  there  is not  up  to the present  a  proved case for making  a change.    In the  existing  state  of the UnemploymentFund, neither of these proposals,  irrespective-of their merits, nor
any  other  improvement of benefits could be  combined  with thereduction of contributions by a full Id.  62. There  is, however,  as we have  stated, the  possibility of compromise,  that  is  to say,  of  combining  a  lesser reduction ofcontributions with improvement of benefits.  It would be possible,for instance to reduce the  contributions of men and women  from18 to 64 not by Id. but by Jd.  This, would  absorb  about half thedisposable  surplus and  leave the other half nearly  3,250,000 ayear available for improvement of benefits.  As can be seen  fromthe table in paragraph 31, this would make possible  a great  variety of changes in rates or  conditions of benefit.  63. Another  form of partial reduction of contributions  is thatnamed above, of taking Id. off the contributions only of the menof 18 to 64, leaving the contributions of women untouched.   Thiswould absorb  4,697,000  of  the  surplus; less than half  of thebalance of  nearly  1,800,000! would suffice to  add  2s. a week tothe rate of  benefit for adult women, so as to bring them up to thesame level  as men.    Yetj another form of compromise would be toreduce the  contributions of men by Id. and those of  women by Jd.and  distribute  the  remaining surplus  of about  900,000 a yTear,partly in raising wonien&apos;s benefit  by  Is.  a week,  and  partly inother ways.  64. Apart  from  any reasons  which  can  be  given  for  anyparticular improvement of benefits, a  general  argument may be advanced for all  such  compromise  proposals that  they make it possible  to improve  the  position  of  the  unemployed  without endangering the solvency of the  Fund.    They meet successfullythe third of the arguments set out above for  reduction of contribu-tions rather than  improvement of benefits.    Granted that  it isimportant to get contributions  below the present emergency level,in order to have a margin of elasticity in the Fund  and avoid  riskof ever having to go above the  present level, it may  be  argued that&quot;  the margin represented by Jd. off the  contributions in placeof Id. is. ample for  all practical purposes.   It  is unlikely that the calculations of the Committee will prove wrong, by  more  than 3,250,000 a year.  Apart from this the general arguments given above for reduction of  contributions and improvement of benefitsrespectively,  apply  in substance to proposals for compromise.           Conclusion,  Finding and Recommendations  65. We  have set out above, so far as we  can  see them,  theprincipal considerations relevant to our problem.  The questionwhich the Government and Parliament are now called on to decide,in the light of these  considerations, raises issues of social policy on which,  according to  their general outlook, reasonable men may reasonably  come  to different conclusions.  We have not, on  this
occasion,  been able  ourselves to be unanimous.:-   But to most ofns, irrespective  of considerable differences of general outlook, thearguments, for treating the present occasion as one for making thefull reduction that is possible in the rates of contribution, appearto outweigh the arguments for any other course.  There is not, iuthe view of most of us, any proved case for improvement of benefits of an urgency  comparable  to  that  which  led last  July  to our proposal to increase the allowance  for  dependent children,  andthere is a proved case  of  justice and expediency  for remission of taxation.  66. We  make a formal recommendation  in this  sense  below,for reduction of contributions  by each  party, in respect  of  allinsured workpeople  of 18 years and  upwards by Id.  a week; wedo not  propose  in this report  any reduction in the contributions for juveniles.  . According to the figures  in  Table II the  change which we  recommend will reduce the  income of  the UnemploymentFund by an average  of  6,468,000 a year over the eight years 1936to 1943.  This  calculation is approximate only and  for practical purposes we state the  cost  of the change  as  about  6,500,000.We  do not  name  any  date for this change.    But change ofcontributions presents considerable  administrative problems, and inour  financial  estimates  we  have  assumed   that  reduction  ispostponed till the new unemployment books are  issued in July.An earlier change would diminish the total resources of the Fund,but not enough  to affect the  substance of our findings.  67. We regret that we should have to come to this, or to  anyother, decision affecting rates of unemployment benefit while thefuture of   unemployment  assistance is  unsettled, , and  . withoutknowledge of  what is likely  to be proposed.  But it.is not  clearthat even. full knowledge of the general rates and  rules of un-employment  assistance  would  help   us  materially,   without  ex-*perience of  their detailed application. We  cannot wait.... for that experience,  and  any recommendation made in   advance  of ex-perience,  whether for reduction of contributions  or  for increasein the rates of benefit would equally  tie our hands for the  future.We can only express the hope that if any change  made in regardto assistance appears to  change materially the  situation in regardto rates or conditions of  benefit,  or  affect any of the argumentsset out above,  we  may  have  an opportunity of reviewing  thesituation and  stating any new conclusions that result.  68. In general, it appears to us that reasoned judgment, as tothe proper level of  unemployment benefit,  for men  and womenalike, involves a fuller study than has yet been made.both of the living conditions of  unemployed persons  and of the relations be-tween wages, benefit, unemployment assistance and  other  formsof assistance.   The  growing direct provision  for  families,  under
unemployment&apos; insurance and  assistance, is  beginning to raiseacutely the  general problem of dependency, under a wage system which.&apos; makes no  similar provision.  We hope  that  it  may bepossible  to. set  on foot enquiries  that  will throw  further lightupon this problem  and will at the same time equip us better infuture than we are ,equipped at present,  to  give reasons  whybenefit should be fixed  at one point rather than  another.  For inmaking recommendations for  the disposal of the present surplus,we are not  in any sense closing the door to  further changes inthe  insurance scheme,  whether  by legislation after enquiry, orin pursuance of further reports on the financial condition  of theFund.  We are saying  only that, on a balance of considerations,some historical and some economic, a substantial reduction  of thecontributions levied hitherto  to pay  for unemployment   is theright present response  to the happy decline  in the  volume ofunemployment.  69. &quot;We conclude our report  accordingly :       (1) By reporting formally under  section 59 (2)  of the Un-     employment  Insurance  Act, 1935,  that  the Unemployment     Fund is, and is likely to continue to be, more than reasonably     sufficient to  discharge its liabilities.      (2) By recommending,  by a majority, as  changes required     to make the Fund not  more than  reasonably sufficient,  that     the  weekly rate  of contribution&apos;payable  by employers and     employed persons  as set  out in the Third  Schedule to the     Act :&apos;-          In the  case  of men who have attained  the age of 21         years should be 9d.  in place of  lOd.          In the case  of women who have attained  the age of 21         years,  and of young men between the ages of 18  and 21         years,  should be 8d.  instead of 9d.          In the  case  of young women  between the ages of 18         and 21 years  should  be 7d.  instead of  8d.      (3) By estimating that  this recommendation will diminish     the income of the Fund by approximately  6,500,000&apos; a  year.

I am in entire agreement with the General Report, and onlydisapprove of those paragraphs which contain the arguments and recommendation  in favour of giving  first place  to  a reduction  ofcontributions.   In this connection I  dissent from the conclusions reached  by the  majority  of the  Committee,  for   the  following reasons.  2. With  the  exception   of  the  evidence submitted   by theNational  Confederation  of  - Employers&apos;  Organisations,   all the written and oral  evidence was in favour of disposing  of the surplusby  increasing benefits.  The statistics in  the detailed evidence of the National confederation-tion,  which related  to  the  payments  for  social  services and workmen&apos;s  Compensation,  showed  that the saving  effected by reducing unemployment insurance contributions  by one penny foreach party, would  be so small as to make it  almost  impossible forsuch saving to be  passed on to  the consumer in lower prices,  orto be used to assist in securing  contracts.-  This was illustrated by showing that on the contract price of  a 90,000 cargo vessel, oi which the Shipbuilders&apos;  direct costs wouldbe   33,300, the  saving effected  would be only  43.   Particularstaken from the report on the Import Duties Act Inquiry (1933)were submitted in  relation to the  Cotton and Woollen Industries,and it was shown  that the  reduction  of the contributions by Id.per week for each  party would benefit the employers to the extentof about   63,000 in the Cotton  Industry and   41,000 in the woollen Industry.  In the same report the figures relating to gross output  in  19&apos;33were as  follows :-Cot ton,  132,701,000; Woollen,   101,897,000.The saving thus  effected  could  not   materially  help  trade andindustry.  3. The Parliamentary  Committee  of the Co-operative Congressalso submitted  detailed evidence relating  to  that  portion  ofUnemployment  Insurance   contributions borne  directly  by the employer and the effect of those contributions on piices.   In con-nection with retail businesses information had been  obtained  from30  large Co-operative Societies ;  and in the eight principal  sectionsof retail distribution, the employers&apos;  contributions varied  between0.21 pence and 0&apos;.45 pence per   1 of sales.  Similar  figures for  32  different  manufacturing sections shewedthat the employers&apos; contributions  varied between 0.12 pence and2.08 pence per  1  output.  The effect of  a  reduction of  the  weekly  contributions by Id.would  be approximately equivalent to one-tenth of these amountsand could make no appreciable difference  in prices to the consumer.  4. I fully agree  with the Committee  that the long view mustbe taken, and that  in order to meet a depression, without having to resort  to  changes in contributions and benefits, reserves must  be
                               siaccumulated, but  having this in mind,  if the surplus is used nowto reduce contributions, I cannot see how it will be possible to makeany further changes in the rates of benefits over a period  of yearsunless there is a substantial  improvement  in  trade  and  a  con-siderable reduction of the estimated number of unemployed duringthe next cycle in trade.  In  effect, the application of  the  full surplus towards a reductionin contributions will,  in my opinion, stabilize  the  benefits for anumber of years irrespective of  any change  under Part II of theUnemployment Act 1934.  5.  I  do not accept  the  view that reducing contributions is asafer  method  of  absorbing a  surplus  than  increasing  rates ofbenefit.   In both,cases there  would be opposition to any  attemptto revert to the old rates.  6. I would strongly urge that the waiting period of six days at thebeginning  of  a continuous  period of unemployment,  for whichbenefit is not paid,  be reduced to three days:  This would bringthe qualifying period into line with  that required under the national health Insurance and Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts.  The presentwaiting period  causes great hardship in the case of insured personsemployed in industries in which it is the practice to work short-timeand who are therefore  subject to much under-employment.  7. A very strong case was submitted by representative bodies infavour of  increasing the  rates  of benefit  and reducing  waiting.period.  If the full available surplus were used for this purpose thefollowing changes could be adopted : 	Weekly Sate		of Benefit.		Annual cost	Present.

                     t Note by MRS. STOCKS.  While I am in full agreement with the  view of the  Committeeconcerning the financial position of the Fund,  I cannot assent tothe whole of  their  conclusions  regarding  the  disposal   of  thesurplus.  .  I do not regard the existing scale of benefit rates as adequate,but I am deterred by the considerations indicated in paragraph 68from  recommending  the immediate application of the  whole  sur-plus to  an   all-round  increase.   I  think, however,  that  theCommittee have given insufficient  consideration to the needs ofwomen  contributors,  and that the present  financial re-adjustmentoffers an opportunity of affording  some remedy  for their discon-tents, in combination with a substantial relief to the burden ofcontributions  on industry.  These discontents,  however, convinc-ingly they may be  severally  rebutted, operate  with  a  kind ofcumulative force when  taken together over the  whole  field of social insurance.  I  believe  that  the  most practical  concessions which it is now in our  power to offer  is the raising of women&apos;sbenefits  to the  men&apos;s existing level,  and that the women  them-selves would  be prepared to pay  for  this by forgoing  any reduc-tion of  their contribution.   Although   this  would involve somediminution in the  total relief to  industry recommended  by  themajority of the Committee, it would  detract little from the reliefafforded  to particular industries such  as coal and shipbuilding, inwhich relatively high labour  costs are  combined  with  production at fiercely competitive world  prices, since  in these industries  theemployment  of women is&apos; negligible.   I  therefore, submit  thefollowing amended  recommendation   for  the  disposal   of  thesurplus:       A reduction  of Id. in  the  contribution for men who have    attained  the age of 18 years and of Jd. in the contribution    for  boys  between the ages of  16  and 18  years :   total  cost     4,836,500.      An increase of 2s. in  the  benefit  for  women  who have    attained  the age of 18  years;  of Is.  6d.  in the  benefit  for    women  between  the ages of 17 and  18;  and of  Is.  in  the    benefit for  girls  between  the  ages of  16 and 17 :  total  cost     1,030,000.  This would leave  a surplus of   633,500  still  available  for  dis-tribution.  As this sum  is  roughly equivalent  to  the  645,000required  to allow of  an additional Is. a week for the first  depen-dent child in every  family,  I suggest  that  it  might be  devotedto this purpose.  Such an addition  would  in all  probability bringinsurance benefits into better relation with  unemployment  assis-tance scales,  without very  materially  increasing  the  anomalousoverlap between benefits and wages in the case of large  families.
  It will be seen that the  above proposals  involve  a simplification-tion of the general  scheme  by the  elimination  of  the existingdifferentiation  between  men&apos;s  and  women&apos;s  contributions  and benefits.  It can thus raise no  insoluble  problem on  the adminis-trative side.  The objection  most commonly  brought against  thisproposal is that it involves a departure from established practice.Further  examination suggests that such  established practice restsmainly  on three arguments.  First : That it is anomalous to apply undifferentiated rates  of contribution and benefit to the differential rates of wages whichprevail  as  between  men and women.   To this may  be  repliedthat such  an  anomaly already  exists  in  connection  with  the differential earnings  of  men, and  would exist to a far more spec-tacular  degree  if non-manual workers earning over   250  a year were at some future  date to be included in the General Scheme.  Second : That lower rates of wages demand lower benefits  inorder to avoid the  possibility  that  the  latter may  approach  orexceed the former.   To this  it may  be  replied that in practice,in so far as this danger  exists in  connection  with the  generalscheme,  the real, danger point arises in the case  of  men withdependants  rather than in  the  case  of women.  Examination  ofexisting Trade  Board rates suggests  that the very usual women&apos;s time rate  at  7d. per  hour is unlikely,  in  conjunction  with  a weekly benefit  of 17s. to produce this particular anomaly.  Third : That a woman&apos;s needs are  so much, less than a man&apos;sas to justify a difference of 2s.  a  week  in  benefit.  Many re-sponsible women&apos;s  organisations have challenged  this  contentionin evidence before us.   There would be  some  force  in it  if menand  women  lived by bread  alone.   They do,  however,  live  bymuch else, including fuel and lodging and, especially when seek-ing work, by &quot; respectable appearances.&quot;  If the arguments  which are held  to justify established practicebreak  down upon examination, and  if on  the other hand solidreasons present themselves  for change  there  seems to be littlesense in advancing the mere fact of established practice in justi-fication of  the  status quo.

NOTES. (1) The figures in Col. (2) are the percentages published in the Labour Gazette and include the Special Schemes for Banking and Insurance.        If the latter were excluded, the percentages would usually be about 0-2 higher.   The figures in Cols. (3) and (4) exclude Special Schemes. (2) There was no change in the rates of contribution between November, 1931 and September, 1934.  As from 3rd September, 1934, juveniles        under 16 became insurable the rate of contribution being 2d. each from Employer, Worker and State irrespective of sex. (3) As from 1st July, 1934, the rates of benefit were restored to the levels in operation before 8th October, 1931, when an Economy cut of 10 per        cent, was imposed. (4) As from 26th July, 1934, the amount of benefit payable  in a benefit year was increased by the grant of additional days under Section 3,        Unemployment Insurance Act, 1934, in cases where there had been a good contribution record in the five years preceding the claim.        This, and the increase in the rates of benefit, account largely for the increased expenditure on benefit after June, 1934. (5) As from 29th August, 1935, the conditions under which benefit can be drawn by seasonal workers  during the off-season were relaxed.  As        from 31st October, 1935, the weekly rate of benefit for each dependent child was increased from  2s. to 3s. at an estimated annual cost of       about  1,250,000.(6) The figures of Income and Expenditure are taken from the Labour Gazette and are provisional figures prior to the detailed examination of       the relevant accounts.(7) The funded debt of the Unemployment Eund at 1st July, 1934, was  105,780,000 ; repayment is being made at the rate of  5,000,000 a year       including principal and interest.(8) Income for 1935 includes  189,000 interest on investments. Except for October ( 99,000), August (21,000), and May ( 24,000) the amounts       included in other months from this source were small.(9) The mean of the twelve monthly percentages of unemployment during 1935, as given in column 2 is 15-4.   The percentage of 15-3  shown in       the last line is the true percentage allowing for the increased insured population in the latter part of the year.
