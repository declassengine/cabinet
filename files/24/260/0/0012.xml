189Confidential Appreciation ox the Political Situation inIndia, dated the 13th February, 1956,  issued on the     authority of the Secretary of State for India           The  death  of His Majesty King George V has  over- shadowed  all other events during  the month.  The celebra- tions  of  the Silver  Jubilee in May last were actuated by the  deep-seated  loyalty  of all classes, but the spontaneous expressions of grief which are reported from every part of India  afford an  even more striking demonstration of the esteem and affection felt by all&apos;towards the King Emperor. In practically every town of India, whether large or  small, there  was an almost  complete cessation of business, either when the  sad news became known, or on the day of the  funeralj all  shops, even  the  smallest, were closed, while in some places there was an  almost complete cessation of traffic.          Reports show that this was no mere formal compliance with the wish  expressed by the Government of India that January 28th should  be  regarded as a day of mourning;  the demonstration  of sorrow was general and spontaneous and every class  and every section of the community took part therein.All  over India public meetings were held,  attended by persons of all shades  of political opinion and of all religions,  while messages of condolence and loyalty have been received from numerous private individuals and public bodies.          Some incidents deserve  mention as showing the depth of feeling.  A District Magistrate in Bengal reports the receipt of letters from unknown villagers  enquiring after his Majesty&apos;s health j- in another  district  an uneducated cultivator ran to his fields  on hearing the  sad  news and stopped his labourers from working;   in Delhi  a  crowd
resented the fact that tramcars were allowed to ply.          &quot;linen India has shown its loyalty to theBritish throne in such clear and unmistakable terms itseems almost incongruous even to refer to the fact thatJanuary 26th was celebrated as independence Day.  On this occasion even the Congress supporters, realising thestrength of public feeling over the King&apos;s death, werehalf-hearted.  The day thus evoked practically no publicinterest - even less than the celebrations of the Congress
