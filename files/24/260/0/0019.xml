D. 0THE WAR OFFICE,  24th February, 1936                  1. The  military  situation on the Northern Front    On the northern front  the operations have entered a third phase.    The first phase lasted  from 2nd October to 8th November, 1935, during whichperiod the Italians advanced  almost unopposed and  without  encountering serious administrative difficulties.    The second phase began after the capture of Macalle, when the Ethiopian forcesincreased, the front stabilized and the Italians, unable to advance further until their communications were improved, concentrated an unnecessary and uneconomical mass oftroops in the newly occupied territory.  This  resulted in a  breakdown on the lines ofcommunication and  great  difficulties in  administration.    The  Italian forces wereimmobilized and the initiative passed to the Ethiopians, who carried out a  series ofdaring raids against the Italian front South of Macalle, and especially against their right flank  along the line of the Taccaze river.    These raids met  with considerable success, and Ethiopian forces under Ras Seyumbroke through the Italian outpost lines  and re-occupied the Tembien district.   TheItalians were then  forced to withdraw their right flank from the Taccaze river  to Adua.This withdrawal increased their administrative  difficulties since it prevented them from using the road Adua Macalle, and  left them with the single road Adigrat Macaile as their only line of communication.   The Ethiopians made a determined effort to exploittheir initial success and to cut  the Italian line of communication  between Adigrat andMacalle ;  they therefore launched the powerful attack which culminated in the fightinground the Uarieu Pass on 22nd January.    The attack was  successful  in that the Ethiopians gained a footing on  the roadAdua Macalle : but in so  doing they suffered heavy casualties  and their effort was spent.  This was the end of the second phase.    The third phase  began with the Italian counter-offensive on 11th February, whichhas resulted in a considerable tactical  success and an advance of  about twelve miles tothe South of Macalle, including the capture of the important feature of Mount AmbaAradam and the infliction of heavy  casualties on Ras Mulougheta&apos;s detachment of  theImperial Army.  The Tembien plateau  has, however, not yet been re-occupied by theItalians ;  thus  they are still confined to the single line of communication via Adigratto Macalle which is threatened by Ras Seyum on the Tembien plateau.   Nevertheless,the Italians are now threatening Ras  Seyum&apos;s lines of communication, which may result in his withdrawal.
                   2.  The military situation on the Southern Front     On the Southern front at  the beginning of hostilities on 2nd  October,  1935, the ethiopian  armies  were not concentrated ;  but  General  Graziani was unable to takeadvantage of this owing to abnormally late  and heavy rains.   The initial advance ofthe Italians was checked  by the reverse at Ananle, when several tanks were capturedand the moral of the Italian Somali troops  was seriously affected.   This reverse was followed by a long  period of  inaction  during which the main Ethiopian  forces,consisting  largely  of  Imperial troops, concentrated in  the Daggah  Bur area underRas Nacibou and dug themselves in on a strong defensive position.  Meanwhile a forceof irregulars under Ras Desta advanced down the  Dawa and  Dorya  branches of theJuba river and threatened the left flank and rear of the Italians.   To  meet this  threatGeneral Graziani concentrated two out of his three divisions on his left flank,  includingthe bulk of the available white  troops, and on 12th  January made  a  sudden  attack onRas Desta, dispersed his army and advanced rapidly to IMeghelli, a distance of  210 milesfrom Dolo.   This  victory, whilst achieving its object of securing General Graziani&apos;s left flank and of raising moral in Italy, does  not offer  the possibility of a decisive success.The rains  begin in this area about  the  middle of  February  and continue till theend of  April, and  during that period movement across country is  difficult owing tothe black cotton soil ; whilst the heavily wooded range of the Jumm-Jumm hills is afurther obstacle to an advance in force beyond Neghelli  towards Allata.   To  maintainthemselves  in  the  positions they now hold in  this area, it will be necessary for theItalians to extend  their front by advancing  up the Webbi Shibeli and the Web Gestvoin order to prevent the  Ethiopians  from again getting in behind them and cuttingtheir communications forward of Dolo.  To achieve a decisive success on this  front,such as  the occupation of the important province  of Harrar and  the cutting of the ethiopian lines of  supply via Jibuti and Berbera, the Italians would  require strongerforces and  better communications than those now available in Somalia.                       3. The Italian administrative problem    (a) The northern front. The Italians began  their advance into Ethiopia before their administrative arrangements were complete  and,  as  a result, have  encounteredcontinuous  difficulties  in  administration.    These  have  been  increased   by  the ethiopian  occupation  of   the  Tembien,  which&quot; prevented the  Italians duplicatingtheir  main  line of communication  to Macalle.  According to Italian  reports thereis  now  a two-way macadam  road  from Asmara  to Adigrat via  Coatit  and fromAsmara to  Adua,  while   the  road Adigrat Macalle is  reported  to  be  metalledand  macadamized to  a point east  of Hausien.   Signor  Mussolini  has stated  thatthe situation as regards roads in East  Africa  is now entirely satisfactory but this isnot, in fact, the case.   The 40 miles of macadam from Adigrat have taken 3 months toconstruct and at the same rate of progress a further 4^ months will be required to reachAntalo (17 miles  beyond Macalle).   On British estimates  6,500 tons of material  arerequired for each  mile of  20-foot wide macadam  road (apart from that required  forbridges and culverts), and it is improbable that the Italians can provide this material alonga road which is being used to maintain .80,000 to 90,000 men in the forward area.     The rainfall in Ethiopia has already  been  discussed in CP. 9 (36), in which  theconclusion was reached  that it  would  he necessary for the Italians  to complete  theconstruction of weather-proof roads by  April.   J udging by  present progress the roadswill  not  he  ready  by this date  and the  Italians will therefore  find difficulty in maintaining their forward  troops.   They will probably  improve  the situation by  a process of thinning out  in the forward  area, but any further advance before  the rainswill correspondingly increase their difficulties.     Another problem for  the Italians  will be the housing of their troops during  the rains.  Although  they will  be  able  to  make some  use  of  local  material for  theconstruction of accommodation, large quantities will also have to be imported  in orderto house the quarter of a  million men  on the northern front.  Even if they reduce theamount of accommodation required in  the forward area by thinning  out their troops,the transport of essential material is bound to increase their road construction difficulties.     A well-informed and  experienced observer has commented on  the  fact that  theItalians have conducted their campaign in East Africa  in terms  of men and guns, andthat their tactics and training are so  indifferent that they are only able to advance underheavy covering fire.   Having reached the limit of range of  their artillery, a long pausebecomes  necessary in  order to move  the guns  forward and  bring up further quantities
of ammunition ; but during  the  rains they will not be  able  to  bring up sufficientammunition for this  purpose, nor will they be able to rely upon the support of aircraft to the extent that they have done so far.   Therefore major offensive action during thisperiod is unlikely.     (jb) The southern front. The limiting administrative factor  on this  front is the lack of harbours and the  difficulty in  disembarking  men  and  stores at east coast ports during the monsoon between June and September.   Although the rains arenot so heavy as in the north, they begin earlier and are sufficient to prevent the move-ment of large numbers of  vehicles along  unmetalled tracks, which in several areas  of operation run across black cotton soil.   As the Italians  have not constructed  metalledroads in Somalia, they will be unable to conduct large large scale operations during the rains.   From June onwards  there is  a  dry  period  until the  autumn rains, but thedisembarkation difficulties referred to above are likely to  prevent  the arrival of rein-forcements  necessary for  a  large-scale  offensive.   It  is  probable, therefore, that theItalians in Somalia will confine themselves to minor operations  until  the conclusion ofthe autumn rains in September.                      4.  The Ethiopian  administrative  problem.     The administrative problem for the Ethiopians is vastly simpler than for the Italiansowing to their  low standard of living and of armament.   They appear  to  be  wellequipped with arms and ammunition, and this is confirmed by the fact that they  haveshown  no haste in  taking  delivery of  recent  consignments.  During  the rains  theymay be expected to pursue guerilla tactics, which  will enable them to  withdraw  atsuitable intervals in order  to replenish their ammunition supply.   No difficulty in thisrespect is therefore anticipated.   Supplies of food in the country are believed to  be adequate, but on the northern front difficulties of distribution during the rains will  be considerable.   This problem is  likely to cause a large reduction of the Ethiopian forces on this front shortly before the rains begin, when  the  various provincial  armies  fromfar-away districts and possibly  a proportion of the  regular army will return  to  their homes  and to Addis Ababa respectively.   It is, however, probable that the local armies of Tigre and  Walkait will  be sufficient to  prevent the Italians, hampered  by  theirinadequate  communications, from  taking any  great  advantage of this thinning out  bythe Ethiopians.   On the southern front Ras Nacibou&apos;s  army  about Daggah  Bur isclose enough to the railway to be supplied throughout  the rains, and the forces nowbeing assembled in Bale and Sidamo will be in a position  to obtain supplies locally.                                   o. Italian  moral      The health of Italian white troops on the northern front has  been good and moralhigh in spite of  friction between regular troops and  Blackshirts,  and in  spite  of thefailure of aircraft and  tanks  to produce the decisive effect which had been expected  ofthem.   The effect of the rains  on these arms  combined  with  improving Ethiopiantactics  against them is likely to produce still further disappointment, whilst difficultiesof maintenance and  accommodation, added to the  depressing  effect of tropical  rain,will inevitably cause Italian health and moral  on the northern front to deteriorate.      In the south Italian health and moral are not so good, especially among the nativetroops,  and are  likely to  deteriorate still  further, owing to  the  rains and  hightemperatures which are approaching.                                 6. Ethiopian moral      The Ethiopians entered the war  with a natural  apprehension  of the unknowneffects  of tanks  and aircraft.   Experience brought confidence, and before Ras Desta&apos;s defeat  near Dolo, Ethiopian moral was high on both  fronts.  Subsequent  defeats near Dolo  and  at  Amba Aradam  have undoubtedly  had a depressing  effect,   but theconsequences are not likely to be serious before the advent of the rains.   In the south Ethiopian  moral rose immediately the Italian advance ceased and it is  possible thatthis will also occur on the northern front.  The rains will increase rather than decrease Ethiopian moral, as they will  stop any major operations  by the Italians, limit the use of tanks and greatly hinder the  employment of aircraft.      A most damaging effect on Ethiopian moral would be caused by the  death of the Emperor.  All control is  centralized in  his hands  and he  combines the  functions ofEmperor, Cabinet and  Commander-in-Chief.   Although, in the event of his death,
some of the Ethiopian armies  would  in  all probability continue to fight under theirown commanders,  there  would  be no unity  of control and their -efforts would beuncoordinated.                                   7. Conclusions     The course of the war from now on will depend largely upon the moral of bothsides, and this in turn depends on  many  factors  which  are still  indeterminate.   Themore distant the period under consideration, the greater  is  the  difficulty  in  assessingthese factors correctly.  The future may be  conveniently divided  into  three periods,namely before, during and after the rains.     Before the rains. The  recent Italian victory on the northern front may lead toimportant  successes,  such as an advance towards Amba Alagi and the clearing of theTembien,  which will have  an  encouraging  effect  on  the Italians, particularly in italy.   The success, however, will be  too late  to permit the Italians to duplicate andperfect their  roads before the rains,  and by the lengthening of  communications will increase their administrative difficulties.   On the southern front General Graziani may increase his territorial gains and render his position more secure by advancing up thetributaries of the Juba river, but operations which  will produce  strategic results are unlikely.   On the Ethiopian side there has  been a lowering of moral  due to their recent defeats, but there is no reason to suppose that this will have a serious effect.     During the rains. On the northern  front the Italians will be involved in serious administrative difficulties  which are  likely to be accentuated by their indifferent  staffwork.   The maintenance  of communication will be precarious owing to  the effect ofrivers  in  spate, and weatherproof accommodation will  almost certainly be inadequateIn  these  conditions health will  inevitably suffer, loss of moral will ensue and friction between regulars and Blackshirts  will increase.   Tanks will be unable  to operate, thesupply of artillery ammunition will be  difficult and  the  action of aircraft will be severely restricted.&apos;  The  Italians are therefore likely to remain on the defensive.  Onthe southern  front the rains  are  less heavy  and their effect will not be so serious.Lack  of  metalled roads  will, however,  prevent large-scale  operations and GeneralGraziani will probably employ his troops in preparing for an offensive in the autumn.     The  rains will bring a period of  relief for the  Ethiopians  from which they maybe  able to profit by engaging  in guerilla  warfare in favourable conditions.   Thisperiod may offer to the Ethiopians an opportunity of  inflicting  considerable damage on the Italians, although  much will depend on  the Emperor and  the  extent to whichhe may be able to maintain the activities of his troops in circumstances of  considerablehardship.     After the rains. As  already  stated it is difficult to forecast events so far ahead,but it  is improbable that Italian administrative arrangements will  be such as to permitthem to launch an immediate offensive on either front.    Assuming that both sides arein the field at the conclusion of the rains and that the Italians  advance in force andsucceed in  occupying Harar, there will be considerable risk of an Ethiopian  collapse.It  is  improbable that  the  Italians  wall  be able  to  stage such an advance  before november.     But whatever happens it seems certain (as stated in CP. 10  (36)) that Italy  isfaced with a long and difficult task, if  she is to achieA&apos;e the conquest of Ethiopia ; and unless the Italians are prepared to abandon their aim of gaining control over the wholeof the  country, the probability is that the moral and determination of the Italian people will not hold  out in face of this long-drawn test of endurance and  the  deterioration ofthe economic situation in Italy.(B36/8) 70 2/36 WO.P,  9312
