THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT1Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.  OUCP. 42  (36).TO BE  KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to     ensure the secrecy  of this  document.CABINET.GERMANY.          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    THE attached paper, which has been  prepared by Sir Robert Vansittart, isthe outcome of prolonged and anxious study in the Foreign Office of the situation created by the extent and rapidity of German rearmament, and the policy which that Power may in consequence now be expected to pursue.    It is in the face of these conditions that British policy has to be determined.Our dilemma is acute.   The poverty of Nazi Germany, measured in that country&apos;sdwindling export trade and increase of  unemployment, may be expected to havethe same effect as in Italy, and to encourage a Dictator to launch his people on some  foreign venture  as the only means that remain to him to  distract their attention from the failure of his policy at home.  Our purpose being to avoidwar, it should follow  that we should be wise  to do everything in&apos;our power toassist Germany&apos;s  economic recovery, thereby easing the strain upon the Germanrulers, and making an outbreak less likely.   The circumstances of this particular case are, however, exceptional, and who could be sure that if, in fact, we do makeefforts to  improve Germany&apos;s economic position,  her  rulers will not use theadvantages they may gain thereby in further prosecuting their rearmament andpreparing their nation for war ?    That is what may be described as the German aspect of the problem.  there remains the British aspect.  We have lately been engaged in the examination ofour own rearmament  programme,  and  Parliament  is - shortly  to be asked tofoot a formidable bill made inevitable by  rearmament elsewhere. Will the british public be satisfied with rearmament alone ?  Will they not say &apos;&apos; Your action inthis sphere may be indispensable, but why do you not accompany it with someeffort  to come to terms with Germany if  that be possible, and thereby seek to spare   the  world the political  and  financial  risks  inherent  in  generalrearmament ? &apos;&apos;    There is  therefore a strong argument  so far as the home  front is concerned for making some attempt to come to terms with Germany; nor, viewed from this aspect, would suojh an attempt have been  in vain even if it resulted in failure, forsuch  a failure&apos; could  reasonably  be expected to show the intransigence ofGermany,  and  the need for our own  rearmament  and the strengthening of collective security would be correspondingly emphasised.    On the other  hand, it is to be expected that any attempt upon our  part to initiate negotiations with  a view  to coming to terms with Germany is likely to arouse suspicions, superficially at least,  in France and more fundamentally in soviet Russia.  There is therefore a  certain risk that our attempt, were it to fail,would leave us with a  confused situation of general mistrust and irritation.  On      8311-   [12619]                                                B
balance, however, I am in favour of making some attempt to come to terms withGermany,  but  upon  one indispensable  condition:  that we  offer no sops toGermany.   There must be no concession merely to keep Germany quiet, for thatprocess only stimulates the appetite  it is intended to satisfy.   We should beprepared to make concessions to Germany, and they will have to be concessions of value to her if they are to achieve their object, but these concessions must only be offered as part of a final settlement which includes some further arms limitationand Germany&apos;s return to the League.     There remains the formidable problem of  what  it is possible to offer toGermany, and it seems that  this* question cannot be clearly answered until it hasbeen interdepartmentally  examined.   The problem  has many  facets :  Colonial,economic, financial, political and geographic.  Are we prepared, for instance, torecognise that Germany should have special  trading advantages in certain areas,e.g., the Danube Basin 1  Are we prepared to surrender our most-favoured-nationrights in order that this may be brought about ?   Are we prepared in certaincircumstances to consider a  guaranteed loan to Germany ?  Are we prepared toconsider the return to Germany, under mandate or otherwise, of even one of thecolonies taken from her during the war ?  Are we prepared, more particularly ifthe German Government devalue the mark,  to resist the probable pressure frominterested parties in this country demanding further exclusion of German goods from the British market ?  Are we prepare &apos;ed to consider with France and Belgiumthe abandonment  of  the demilitarised zone ?   Are  we prepared, in  fact, to approach Germany with proposals to collaborate so far as possible in a new periodof European tranquillity and economic  reconstruction,  instead  of as  hithertowaiting in anxiety for her  &apos;&apos; claims &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; repudiations &apos;&apos; ?    If an  approach is  to be made to Germany  with any reasonable chance ofsuccess, it will be indispensable to pool what we  have to give.  For this purpose suggest  that the first  step would be for this problem to be urgently examinedinterdepartmentally, or preferably by a  Cabinet Committee,  with a  view to ascertaining what contributions could be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and could reasonably be expected from other Governments, and in what circumstances,to facilitate an agreement with Germany.                                                                   A. E.Foreign Office, February 11, 1936.
                 BRITAIN,  FRANCE  AND  GERMANY.         &quot; THE present Ethiopian imbroglio is mere child&apos;s play compared     with the  German problem that will, in some not very distant future,     confront His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;       (Extract from Sir E. Phipps&apos;s despatch No. 1129, the 6th November, 1935.)     1.  The foundations on which relations  between Great Britain, France andGermany have been based since the Peace have  been  steadily undermined for thelast three years.  The process began with the advent to power of Hitler, pledged to give Germany the strength necessary to free her from the shackles of the peace settlement.  It was continued by the breakdown of the Disarmament Conference,leaving Germany with an exploitable grievance; and  it  has accordingly beencompleted by the intensive rearmament of Germany first secret, but now open and defiant.  The whole country has, in fact,  been militarised from top to bottomon a scale never before contemplated in any State, and in this respect the germany of 1936 will be, within measurable time, stronger than the  Germany  of 1914.The  result is that  at the  present  time  the  relations between  the three great powers of Europe are at the mercy of the ever-increasing suspicions, anxieties andfears with which the whole continent is now beset.    2.  Already in 1934 attempts were made to deal with this political disorder;and the Anglo-French Declaration of February  1935 represents  such an attemptin a constricted sphere by the legalisation of Germany&apos;s rearmament in  returnfor the maintenance  of the territorial  status  quo  in Europe and through  thecreation of an Air Locarno in the West.   A  year earlier this might have proved a possible basis for a  fresh European settlement; but it was already insufficient,and was speedily wrecked in March by Hitler&apos;s unilateral repudiation of Part Vof the Treaty of Versailles.  A further attempt to meet  the situation was made when the Stresa resolutions were adopted in April by Great Britain, France andItaly.  Hitler&apos;s speech of last May, read in the light of his repeated protestationsof goodwill and desire for co-operation,  revived the hope that something might still  be effected on the lines  of the  February  Declaration; but  such  doubtfulprospects were definitely destroyed by the advent of the Abyssinian crisis. Hitler,not unnaturally,  decided that he  had better not commit himself until he  sawhow the  quarrel  between Italy  and the League developed.   More particularlywas  he interested in  seeing whether it  developed into a direct  conflict betweenGreat Britain and Italy, and,  if so, how Anglo-French relations would stand the strain of a division in French sympathies.  (In this respect he entertained hopeswhich have not been fulfilled :  see,  for example, the Secretary of State&apos;s  telegramfrom Geneva,  No. 5, L.N., of the 21st January.)    3.  This   paralysis  in  the   relationships  between  the  three  GreatWestern  Powers cannot continue -indefinitely. The Versailles  system has broken down  and,  until something  else is put  in  its  place,  general instability  and consequent tension will continue and draw  nearer to breaking  point.  Before,.however,  we begin to search for that something else, we should be clear  thatno settlement of any kind least of all the one that I put forward either couldor should  be sought except at  Geneva.  That is  not to say that the preparationsmust  not be made outside  Geneva.  On the contrary many patient alternationsof reflection and approach will have to be made privately, directly (and jointlyat some stage with France) before there can be any hope of  negotiations  ripeningto a state when they might fruitfully be brought to  Geneva.   And one otherpoint should perhaps  be made clear by way  of preface.  In this paper there ismuch emphasis on the need for the  rearmament not only of this country but of allthe effective members of the League. This is not  to say that the cause of disarma-ment  is hopeless, but only that it is hopeless  for a period during which  anypotential aggressor must be convinced that  joint defence  will  always  be more powerful  than solitary attack^ and  that therefore the armament game  is not
eventually worth the financial candle which it burns at both ends.   In reply toany apprehension that the interim policy of armament is dangerous it may be pointed out that there is  no quotable instance where arms have  produced war.1914 came  about largely because of Russia&apos;s known weakness; and a new warin the Far East has not come about so far just because both parties are so strongthat it does not seem worth while.  With  this brief  introduction we may now come to the problem itself.    4.   In dealing with  the grievances of post-war  Germany,  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  have  always  advocated coming  to  terms  with  her  whenever possible.  From the  earliest  years  following  the  war  it  was  our objectto modify  those  parts of  the Treaty  of  Versailles  which  we  knew  to beuntenable.   That was the policy  underlying our repeated  attempts  to make a workable reparation settlement.  That was the policy which inspired  the Treatyof Locarno and the summoning of the Disarmament Conference;  which secured the withdrawal of the Military Control Commission, and  led to the Declarationof December 1932, recognising, subject to the establishment of a  system of security, Germany&apos;s equality of status in armaments.  It was this policy alsowhich brought about  the London  Declaration of last February.  The principle underlying this Declaration may  still stand (even  though its framework  is nolonger  suitable  to present  conditions), for its fundamental and consecutive idea was  that  the ex-Allied Powers should remove Germany&apos;s grievances by theprocess of  give and take,  before  Germany  took  the  law  into her own hands.This policy is still the constructive one.  The alternative  of permanent drift isavowedly a counsel of negation and despair; and there are grave  and obviousdangers in a policy of encirclement.  There is, therefore, in this memorandum no suggestion  that the policy of understanding should  be abandoned.  On thecontrary, we should consider whether, despite the breakdown of  the LondonDeclaration and the  reappearance of a most  menacingty  powerful Germai^,we can find new bases on which to  pursue the course consistently attempted  by ussince the Peace of 1919. By this is not merely meant the conclusion of an agree-ment settling specific questions.  This would, no doubt, be an essential preliminary to any real settlement; but by itself it would probably achieve little or  nothing inthe long run, unless followed by a complete re-orientation if that  be possible ofthe present relations between Germany on the one hand and Great Britain andFrance  on  the other.   This  would, in effect, mean that, instead of  approaching the problems of Europe, as now, with a preconceived idea that in every case the(interests of Germany must  necessarily conflict with those of France  and GreatBritain, we should  see whether there is any durable possibility of collaboration between the three PoAvers on a footing of  complete equality both  directly and through the League  of Nations.   In  practice,  however, such  a  policy  mustencounter grave obstacles, which must be faced early and fully.  The omens are notfavourable, the less so perhaps because it must also  be postulated that such asystem  must not be injurious  to  the interests of  any Power, great or  small.Though attempts would certainly be made particularly by Soviet Russia toallege  that such injury was being done, in fact  there can be little  doubt thatthe ultimate interest of the whole  of Europe would be served by  the elimination of friction between the three Great Western Powers.     5.  Let us first examine briefly the alternatives. - His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment might simply allow  the situation to develop, wait for new  German claims to mature, ^ and hope either- that the  Powers affected  by  them will then beable and willing to come to some  compromise with Germany, or  that the threat of resort by the League of Nations to economic sanctions will be sufficient to keepthe  German claims within  bounds.   But it must be plainly foreseen that thelatter will be a dangerous delusion in the case of  Germany a few years  hence,unless the  League as a whole is adequately armed, and the standard will haveto be  high.  Merely  to Avait on  events will become  steadily more dangerousin  face  of  a rearmed   Germany,  who,  in  contrast  with  the post-war years,  is now  seeking not  the  removal of grievances but  the  satisfaction ofambitions.   In practice, it  is likely to mean that Germany will  choose her owntime for asserting each of her claims and that Europe Avillbe forced to deal with each one separately, when Germany elects to raise it.  Such a procedure clearly,gives an enormous advantage to Germany.  We should therefore only adopt itTUf
if and when we have  satisfied ourselves by experiment that no other course ispossible.    6.  The negative  attitude has, however,  undoubtedly powerful  advocates-among those elements throughout Europe who feel their very existence dependenton the uncompromising  defence of  an inelastic status quo.   They hope  that something may eventually turn up to check the forces  now threatening  it,  and,so long as  this hope  exists,  they  will exercise all the forces  of obstructionat their disposal to prevent any settlement with  Germany.   They, the  smaller-Powers, even more than  France, will count upon us to  preserve that status quo,.by force if necessary.   Indeed, that they already  interpret  in  this  sense thefidelity of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the League is clear from many indicationswhich need not here be enumerated.   Suffice it to say that the outstanding exampleis the clanger-spot, Czechoslovakia.  Sir J. Addison&apos;s  despatch No. 223 of the11th November is almost crudely outspoken on this point; and another  danger-spot, Lithuania, has similar hopes.    7.  As  regards the policy of encirclement, we must begin by distinguishingit from the League doctrine  of  collective security.   Collective security might become, or  appear to be, encirclement,  unless it were combined with an elasticpolicy of  settlement.   This   may  be  the  only   difference; but it  is   oneof  capital  importance.   This said,   we  may  consider for  a  moment  thepolicy of  encirclement pure and  simple.   Briefly, while on  the  one hand itmight put  the anti-Revisionist Powers  in  a stronger bargaining  position vis-a-vis of  Germany, on the other its  value from a military, as distinct from apolitical, point of view, must always remain extremely doubtful.  If it were our only method of dealing  with  Germany, it would almost certainly provoke theorganisation by her of a counter block.  The ingredients of  this block mightnot be of the first order,  but the same remark would apply to the residue left inor on our hands.  And a further observation must now be made.  Hitherto, ofcourse,  it has  always been assumed that Italy would form  part indeed  an indispensable part of any counterpoise to Germany.  That position was  reached at Stresa; but  the assumption  is no longer possible.   No one can foretell whateither her tendencies or her capacity will be as a result of her war with Abyssiniaand her quarrel with the League.   All we can say is that this new uncertaintyrenders any prospect of an effective encirclement of Germany even more doubtful:than before.    8.  There  is yet another conceivable policy, and it is this : to trust to the propaganda value of the League coupled, of course,  with the rearmament ofits  members with all the  weight  that a League  victory over Italy  will  add.The hope would be that thus moral attraction and penetration would combinewith  material warning to keep the  peace.  This policy would be completed bygetting rid  of the demilitarised zone in order  to eliminate premature causes of conflict.  This  course  is, however,  open to several objections.  First, we mustanyhow get rid of the demilitarised zone;  and  such  a  concession will  notsolve  the  wider  questions discussed  in  this  memorandum.  Secondly,  theeffect  of  the  League  in  Germany  will  be nothing  or  very  little,  untilthe German rulers so desire  : moral propaganda contrary to the present Germantaste  has no chance of penetrating or influencing the public.  Thirdly, a Leaguevictory  over Italy will not  be  taken as any criterion in Germany; Hitler willjudge only by the strength and readiness of the component parts  of the League,and these clearly still  leave much to be desired.  Fourthly, this policy offers no&apos;solution of the means by which we are all to gain  time to rearm effectively, forrearmament, like the elimination of the demilitarised  zone, must form  part ofany policy that we may adopt.    9.  Thus the  examination of  possible alternatives seems  to show that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be well advised to resume the exploration of their former policy of coming to terms with Germany, provided always that this courseproves possible, honourable  and safe.  On such a large hypothesis the  following questions arise : (a) What prospects have we of applying it at present for wemust  move soon or not at all and (b) on what basis is it contemplated that we:should work 1[12619]
    10.  As regards the prospects, the dominating factor is the reappearance ofa Germany armed to the teeth, and very long teeth  too.  The settlement of 1919was made in her absence.  Already the new Leviathan has greatly modified it bydestroying the reparations and armaments provisions of the Treaty of Versailles.It is impossible to suppose that the huge and increasing armaments of germany will not drive further penknives through the parchment.  Once this unpleasantfact be recognised, it would seem desirable that these changes should be made, ifpossible, as part of an agreed settlement and not as a result of demands formulatedunder  the threat  of military pressure.  The difficulty,  however,  is that the newGermany  will demand  territorial  changes, and in this category there is littlelatitude for compromise.    11.  It will not, however, be possible to discuss any form of settlement withGermany without bringing into account the second new factor in the situation,which  must be the  extensive rearmament of  this country.  This will certainlyfacilitate negotiation.  It may also in many quarters in this country create the expectation of such  an  attempt.   But, because we  are starting so  late, it may also postpone negotiation, whereas Germany may not long be in a mood for any settlement acceptable to us  or  to  anyone.  The corollary  is obvious.  It mustbe added, however,  that some of Hitler&apos;s followers have recently expressed theview that time is on their side, and that the  longer we put off co-operation, themore advantageous will be Germany&apos;s eventual position in negotiations.    12.  The third new factor in the  situation is the German economic position.At present it is undergoing a severe and increasing strain, which may in the nearfuture have serious  effects on the foreign policy  of the  German Government.Indeed, I have heard more than one representative of the older German  schooldeclare that it-can only  end in Avar.  Economic distress was  (at least in part), inthe cases both of Japan and Italy, the prelude to military  adventure.  It mustnaturally be our object to counteract, if possible, any latent causes for  the adoptionof a similar and even more catastrophic policy by Germany.   We are, in principleat least, more likely to succeed  in  this  endeavour by  co-operation than byostracism.  That, however, emphatically does  not mean that we should go  out ofour Avay prematurely to finance a bankrupt, and in some respects a fraudulentlybankrupt Germany, still less a megalomaniac bankrupt.  None the less, without some German recovery there can be no full recovery from the crisis, and increasingpoverty in Germany is at least as real a danger to peace as any undue trucklingor exhibitions of fear  among her  neighbours.   By the  Trade and PaymentsAgreements His  Majesty&apos;s Government haA^e  shown their willingness to reachfriendly arrangements with Germany in the economic sphere.  These agreements are appreciated  in  Germany, and  there  is no doubt that a further advance is desired,  although we must  still  be  careful  how  far  we contribute  to her economic strength until she has discarded her aggressive attitude  and  giventangible proof of her oft-proclaimed pacifism by entering into a reasonable generalagreement with some of  her neighbours, and by explicitly setting at rest the fears of the others.  The terms of such  reasonable  agreement and assurances are not,however, going to be easy to find, let alone to define.   The subject is further dealtwith in paragraph 34.    13.  The  fourth new and  important development is the desire of  certainelements in France for an understanding with Germany.  It must be said at once,however, that the desire is at present-as in many quarters in this country dueto fear rather than to clear thinking; for neither its chief exponent, M. Laval, northe Quai d&apos;Orsay have so far shown the least idea of how to set about it in hardpractice.   The change  of inclination, for what it  is worth,  is mainly due toM. Laval, who is never thorough  or precise;  and the delicate plant may notsurvive his fall from office most certainly not if M. Herriot has the last word.Until  recently,  the  inclination  of successive  French Governments, supremelydistrustful of Germany, has been  to use even the most unreal provisions  of theTreaty settlement as  factors working for delay.  Whenever a compromise withGermany could be postponed, France was blind enough to think that other german demands  would  be more  slowly  developed.   It  was  for this reason that oneopportunity after another of coming to terms with  Germany was  lost,  whenvoonditions were  far more favourable than they are  at  present.  The  partial
                     i:  r  ; \.    no                          -iffrealisation of the mistake made in rejecting Germany&apos;s offer with regard to land and air armaments in the spring of 1934 seems to have strengthened the nascentfeeling that some directs if undefined understanding ought to be speedily soughtwith Germany in matters where negotiation is still possible.  Certain elements inFrance, conscious of the difficulty and danger of  attempting to mobilise the manin the street for anything but self-defence, and faced with the accelerated increase.of Germany&apos;s power  as  well as the uncertainty of Italy&apos;s future,  have,  in  fact,.played with the idea of reducing France&apos;s commitments in the East and Centre-of Europe  and abandoning though not  overtly her  position as leader andguarantor  of the  anti-German block.   It  is also possible  that the block mayabandon France, unless she shows more resolution and efficacy in supporting theLeague.  We should bear these possibilities in mind; but they are no more thanpossibilities, less likely to be fulfilled as it  becomes ever plainer to Europe thatthere is only one real cause for supreme anxiety.    14.  Lastly,  there is the attitude of Germany or  rather of Hitler.   Untilthe time when the Abyssinian  crisis altered  the whole situation,  he and hisrepresentatives were repeatedly professing their desire for friendly relations withGreat  Britain and France.  Herr Hitler himself publicly stated for our benefit.that he wished to  &quot; maintain such relations as will for ever prevent  a repetition of the only war which there has yet been between the two nations.&quot;   Herr von ribbentrop went even further, and during the naval discussions in London statedthat the Chancellor  considered  &quot; a recurrence  of the  unprecedented  conflict between the two great nations of the  same race must be avoided on any condition,and that ultimately only an adjustment of the vital interests of the two countries and a common realistic attitude towards the great European problems can produce a solution of these problems and, in particular, a Franco-German settlement. .  . .The German people and the Fuhrer would be glad if His Majesty&apos;s Governmentgave  their  serious  consideration to  these ideas.&quot;   In  the  case  of  France,Herr Hitler, in his speech of the 21st May, &apos;&apos; solemnly recognised and guaranteedthe frontier  resulting from  the Saar plebiscite,&quot;  and  stated that  Germany was&quot; prepared to do everything to arrive at  a true peace and a real friendship  withthe French nation.&quot;    15.  Probably the underlying motives  of these declarations  were various.vague  and  changing.    Eecent  secret   information  has  indicated  that  someadvocates at least of the expansionist  policy in  Germany  have by no meansrenounced  their aspirations in the- west.   Indeed, we cannot, altogether, rejectone current  explanation, that Herr Hitler may be deliberately lulling  Frenchand  British suspicions until he  is able to attack or  dictate.  Dr.  Goebbels  atleast went far to let  this cat out of  the  bag in his speech of the I7ch January.The westward blow is, in fact, the principle of the Schlieffen plan,  and it is to befound  definitely stated in Mein  Kampf &quot; Germany  must  single out the  most dangerous  of her enemies and attack him with all her  forces.&quot;  A second andmore probable explanation  (which throws into relief one of  the real obstacles to negotiation)  is that  these  advances  proceed  from the  wish to neutralise andstabilise the situation in Western Europe, while the attention of Germany isturned to the much more complex and uncertain conditions in the  Centre and east^1)  The Polish  General Staff,(2) hitherto very reticent, have now revealedthat they, too, fear a German drive eastward in a couple of years a calculationnear to one  that I have often put forward in the past.  In other words -thisexplanation  would run Germany, for the  present at any  rate, recognises thather expansion to the West would meet with more opposition than in the East.On the other hand, expansion into regions already containing German minoritiesor traditionally a field for German enterprise may soon seem a practicable task.(3)   (1)  &quot; Much as we all recognise to-day the necessity of a conflict with France, such a coursewould be completely ineffective in the long run  if the conflict constituted a final goal of our foreign policy.   It can and will only have a meaning if it offers to us cover in the rear for the-increase of the territory of our nation in Europe.&quot; Hitler, Mein Kampf.   (-)  See Sir H. Kennard&apos;s  despatch No. 501 of December 31, 1935.   (3)  &quot; While the Chancellor,&quot; writes Sir E. Phipps,  &quot;obsessed by his Bolshevik nightmare,.wishes to keep Poland intact and to place the problem of the corridor somewhere near the bottom of the long list of Germany&apos;s remoter aspirations, Eastern Germany does not take this view, nor do military or Junker circles.  German intentions regarding Poland are therefore obscure, and a surprise cannot be ruled out.&quot;
Probably yet another motive underlies Hitler&apos;s approaches to Great Britain andFrance.&apos; May not he find it  increasingly difficult and  impolitic to admit  theostracism of&apos;the other &quot;Great  Powers&quot;?  Any success  in  breaking it,  forexample, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, adds considerably to his prestige.He would no doubt prefer, if possible, to be on friendly, indeed confidential, terms with one or other of these Powers.  He has clearly shown, both in Mein Kampfand in his  conduct as Chancellor, where in that event his preference would  lie;but if he fails he may seek the required friendship with  Japan or  even Russia.The latter is indeed continually hinted at in Germany, and though .the hints  arepartly blackmail, the policy has some powerful exponents in the army, in industryand even in the Party.  The  army, in the words  of Sir  E. Phipps in a recentletter to me, is indeed  &quot; hankering after a return to Rapallo, more particularly since  the  Russians  have  given  signs  of  embarking  on a   programme  ofrearmament.&quot;  With Japan the German General Staff are already on close terms.Hitler&apos;s racial  prejudices, and his desire to stand well with the United States,still  disincline him  to  any definite arrangement with a yellow race, but  the contingency cannot be excluded.   On the whole,  however,  it  seems probable thathe will not abandon  his policy of an understanding with England, whatever  thearriere-pensees which inspire that policy, until he is satisfied that he is pursuing a chimera.    16.  Whatever  Hitler&apos;s  real motives and intentions  may have been inadvocating  agreement  with  Great  Britain and France,  we have  recentlyexperienced a marked coldness on his part.  As soon as the Abyssinian crisisarose, Hitler at once  drew in his horns, and discouraged any further  exchanges of views.   At length M. Laval took the initiative,  first through unofficial channelsand then through the French Ambassador at Berlin, to resume contact-and HisMajesty&apos;s Government have since folkrwed suit by instructing their ambassador at Berlin to approach Hitler on the specific questions of the proposed Air pact and  Air Limitation Agreement.  The results  were more than  negative : theywere  definitely  unfavourable, and  the  tone was increasingly  ominous.   TheFrench Ambassador was told that it would be useless to resume conversations untilthe Italo-Abyssinian question was settled.  With  Sir E.  Phipps the Chancellorwent further.   He stated for  the first time that the Franco-Russian Treaty had made any Air Pact impossible, and that, as regards the proposed Air LimitationAgreement, the air strength of Germany must be based not on parity with France as previously asserted but on a calculation  which would take  into accountRussia&apos;s air strength.  In fact, Sir E.  Phipps gained the impression that weshould be expected to content ourselves with a portion only of  the air strengthof Germany, and that, generally, Herr Hitler was bent on rearming at will.    17.  Thus the present conditions are, it must be recognised, very far frompromising.   But this may be temporary, and in any case it need not mean thatHis  Majesty&apos;s  Government should abandon  their previous policy,  if  they  areprepared to face certain conditions and consequences,  which will be dealt withlater.  But in  that event we  should begin early to clear our minds as regardstactics and details, and to prepare the ground  both at home and abroad for anew effort.    18.  This  brings us  to  the question  of what the basis for such possiblenegotiations would have to be. One thing would seem essential the basis mustbe as broad as  possible, that is to  say it must not be restricted to an agreementbetween Great Britain and Germany,  and it must not  be confined to certain limited problems.  In  fact,  to be worth  while, it must  not  be a temporary andlocal  detente  but a  lasting  and  comprehensive  settlement.   This  is  a  hardsaying,  and the Germans would probably urge the disintegrating  course of a purely Anglo-German  understanding on certain specified questions, pointing tothe aforesaid Naval Agreement  of last summer.   But we should be careful  notto enter into temptation, for, useful and, indeed, inevitable as  that agreementmay have been, any technical or political variant of it would, in present conditions,not only fail to contribute to European appeasement; it would merely arouseresentment  and suspicion in  an  even  higher degree  than its prototype.  In a word, a settlement with Germany to be effective  must be European,  and must therefore  be  inclusive and  not  exclusive  as regards  its  participants  andbeneficiaries.
     19.  It would clearly  be  impossible  to  insist on  the  negotiations beingcribbed within the narrow  formula of  the February Declaration.  They wouldhave to cover peace in Europe,  and no subject and no method of approach could therefore  be prohibited in advance.  Even so there would be need of some definite-subject with which to open,  and for this purpose the proposed Air Pact and AirLimitation  might,  if the opportune moment  comes, prove the best, though an air  Pact and Air  Limitation Agreement alone would, in German eyes,  be rather a concession on Germany&apos;s part than an advantage, since her factory  output is far higher than ours and, to quote again our latest information, German militaryaviation is  &quot; advancing at  a pace which is not even realised in well-informedGerman quarters.&quot;  Alternatively, some economic gambit might be used.  Thiswould  require considerable further exploration;  but, it may be said at  once thatno purely  economic solution will alone suffice to stay the German appetite.  Or,again,  the approach might  be  by way of a revision of the Treaty of Locarno,.i.e.,  the elimination  of the  Demilitarised  Zone  provisions, a  nettle  whichwe  should  be  wise  to grasp  before  it  stings  us.   Or,  again, if  presentevents  develop favourably  for  the  League,  it might be possible to raise withGermany the question of the revision of the Covenant.  We have all  professedthe need for elasticity in the League, but it is difficult at the present stage to foresee clearly how the wide and vague question of revising it is likely to develop-in practice, if at  all.   Moreover,  it has been hitherto impossible  to induceHerr Hitler to  elaborate his  cryptic remarks, made both  during the Berlinconversations of March and in his speech of the 21st  May,  as to the changes which  he considered necessary before Germany would return to Geneva.  He hasspoken of  &quot; separation of the Covenant from the  Treaty of  Versailles,&quot;&apos;&apos; equality of rights in all functions and all property rights in international life,&apos;&apos;and  &quot;  free play for change and revision  of treaties.&quot;  Until the real meaning ofthese words has been put to the test of exhaustive discussion, it  may well besuspected  that it  is not the procedure  but the principles of  the  League thatdisplease Germany, and that it is not machinery but geography that she reallywants  to revise.  It is thus clear that there are many openings through  which an approach might  be begun, if we will;  but none of them alone will lead to any real  settlement, for that is a question, not of method, but of substance.     20.  We therefore come to the substance,  and it would seem to be this. &apos; Ifwe wish to achieve a  comprehensive settlement, as contrasted with a temporarydetente, then we must face the  fact that this settlement must take the form of abargain.  A bargain can only be achieved at a price.  If, therefore, the settle-ment is to be anything more than paper, if, indeed, it is to be honourably paid for by  us and  not  by Germany&apos;s unwilling and unconsulted neighbours, we find ourselves approaching the heart of the question.  We obviously do not want to deceive ourselves by  any ephemeral window-dressing.  Do we or do  we not want to bring Germany back  into the concert of Europe ?  Do wtJ  want  anagreement that might possibly,  but by no means certainly, endure ?  Lo we want to give to Germany something to bite  on  during the next few years, therebydepriving  critics of the argument that we have made no honest attempt to revise the Treaty of Versailles after  more than fifteen years of uneasy  status quo tThen,  in existing  circumstances,  and facing the world as it  is and not  as wewould  have  it be, we have got to pay for it.  Nothing else will now serve.  for it must never be forgotten that the day is past when Germany&apos;s grievances mighthave been  satisfied at  little cost.  Fair words and empty promises are not going-to suffice  for  much  longer to keep her  vaulting ambitions within bounds.Everyone will be agreed that  little or no latitude  can  be allowed  to  germany for expansion in  a  densely peopled Europe, where expansion, in fact,  really meansboth  robbery and murder.   If  we  do not agree broadly to this proposition, weshall be laying ourselves open to the obvious charge that we are a good memberof the  League in Africa and a  bad one in Europe, and any such supposition wehave publicly repudiated  by  our note  to  the  French  Government  of  the26th September,  1935.   We  cannot  make a stand for Abyssinia and connive atthe  spoliation of  Lithuania,  or Czechoslovakia,  or Austria.  Such   concreterectifications of  the European  map as would  be  defensible  would inure to thebenefit of  Hungary rather  than Germany.   Yet we are explicitly warned  bySir  E.  Phipps that the question  in  Germany is no longer whether  she shallexpand, but where and when.  The moral is  thus  becoming more  obvious,  but before  drawing it  we may do well to take a final and dispassionate look round
    21.  What, in fact,  are the main  German aims entertained  for  eventualexecution,  unless,  by means  of  some bargain, Germany can  be persuaded  toabandon part of them ?M ilitary.    At sea, Germany contemplates the construction by 1942 or earlier of a fleet35 per cent, of the strength of our own;, on land,  the establishment of a peace-time army of  36 divisions, with a strength of 550,000 men, capable by  1943  of expansion  on  mobilisation  to the pre-war  strength  of 100  divisions thoughalready nobody  in Europe believes that this  and not the sky is the  limit; in theair, the creation by 1937 of an air force of a first-line strength of at least 2,000machines though, again, few in Europe will agree that this  represents morethan a portion of reality a  force no longer the equal of the British and French air forces respectively,  but basing itself, in any negotiations  for limitation,  onthe air strength of Russia  also, a calculation which obviously entails  a vastincrement  in  industry,  a war organisation  certainty far superior to anythingyet seen or planned in the world.  In human life, Germany is already completing the militarisation of an efficient race from one end  of the  social scale to theother, and from the earliest years of its every member to the last moment whenany use can be extracted from him, or even her.  Armed forces, diplomacy, civilservice, industries, commerce, education, religion, labour,  are all  being forced into the same channel  and being made subservient  to  the same aim to makeGermany  &quot; by far the strongest  power in Europe.&quot;Political.    In Western   Europe,   Germany  aims   at   the  remilitarisation  of  the rhineland, and, at a more distant date, the recovery of the Schleswig  territorylost in 1919.   With regard to the former objective, indeed, an  obvious process of grievance-mongering is now  being constructed with a view to  eventual justifica-tion; and the  French are already in a state of disquiet, which may soon compel us to take a decision as to our own attitude.    Overseas, Germany intends  to re-acquire the colonies.    In Central and Eastern Europe, as  part of the fundamental aim of theNational  Socialist Party, stated in Mein Kampf  and,  less openly, on  frequentoccasions  since  the accession of the Party to power,  Germany contemplates,  atvarying distances,  and by various degrees, incorporation in the German  Reichof all  German-speaking people  in Europe at present outside  it.  This will  beseen to be the tallest of tall orders, if it is to include not only Austria and theGerman districts  of  Czechoslovakia, but  also Eupen and Malmedy, Schleswigand Polish Upper Silesia,  Transylvania  and German  Switzerland/4)   In anycase it will include      (1) Economic penetration and exercise of a predominant  political  influence           in the Danube Basin and in the Balkans.     (2) Re-annexation  of Memel and Danzig.     (3) Political assimilation and ultimately territorial annexation  of  Austria           and  part of Czechoslovakia.     (4) Economic penetration into the Baltic States, Poland and Russia;     (5) Territorial annexations  in  Poland  and  Russia (e.g.,  conquest  of the           Ukraine by Germany and Poland for the  benefit of Poland in return           for  the cession of the Corridor to Germany), and complete political           control of the Baltic States.     The order in which these five aims are arranged represents not only the most likely  chronological  order,  but also the relative degree of  probability.  His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador  at Berlin tabulates not in  order of priority the recently professed German claims as follows :  (A)  full cultural autonomy for the German                    (*)  &quot; What is the German Fatherland &apos;?                        Now, children, take your maps in hand,                        And see if you can tell me what                        The German Fatherland is not.&quot;                                               -Punch, 1870.    The first point  of the Nazi Party Programme lays down that &quot; we demand, on the ground of the right of self-determination of all peoples, the union of all Germans in a greater Germany.&quot;
minority in Czechoslovakia;  (B)  a referendum in Austria under British super-vision !  (C) greater economic possibilities for Germany in South-Eastern Europe;(D) the return of the colonies in return for which stabilisation would be granted in the west, including Holland. In return for all these concessions, Sir E. Phippsindicates  that  Germany might return to  a new League, revised with Germanco-operation, though without any belief in such treaties  or ideas as the Leagueor Locarno.   A re-formed League would only be acceptable to Hitler as a meansof placating this country.   In his heart he would probably sooner that the league should collapse after an Italian secession, and then be re-formed with the fourGreat European Powers controlling it, and Germany controlling the other three powers.  Till he is convinced that this is impossible, he might conceivably leavedormant the demilitarised  zone.   Of the points enumerated above,  it is stillprobable that Austria would take priority; but it is still more probable  that both(A)  and (B) above would lead very shortly to complete absorption.  For thepurposes of  (B) the  German Ministry for  Foreign Affairs but not Hitler would desire the downfall of Mussolini.     22.  Despite  the direct  threat constituted by the aims of Germany  in central, Eastern  and  South-Eastern Europe, they have  not  created  anyuniformity  of  opinion or  purpose  on  the  part  of  the  States  concerned.Of  the  Baltic  States,  Latvia  and  Estonia  have  been disposed  to protectthemselves by  some  non-aggression pact (such as  the Eastern  Pact)  withGermany;  but  Lithuania, in  the  Memel question,  has   seemed almost  to favour,  so far  as  Germany is concerned,  a policy of provocation.  Poland hasmade at  least  a  superficial  peace  with  Germany.   Russia  seeks  safety  inarmaments which outstrip her technical efficiency.  Yet this difference of methodshould not blind us  to  the fact that on one point  these  States are  probably  allunited; they will  not  be  despoiled  without a fight, which  may mean  a newEuropean war;  and every year that passes makes it less easy to alter boundariesin these regions.  In the South-East the position is in this respect  less  secure.A majority of  the population in Austria  is favourable to something like union with Germany,  while Hungary, to whom  Germany is an important  market forthe sale of raw material and agricultural produce, falls daily more under german military influence.  General Gombos is, indeed,  already trying  to take his countryopenly into the German camp, though he is meeting with resistance  from his minister for Foreign Affairs.   Bulgaria  is hesitating and is closely bound  by economic  ties to Germany, as indeed  also  is Greece.   Yugoslavia^  policy  isdominated by hostility to Italy;  and she is  already suspect of flirting  withGermany, though it may well be that this flirtation will not be carried far whilePrince Paul holds the Regency, provided that France dees not abandon or fail the little Entente.   Despite M. Titulescu&apos;s efforts Roumania is not a sure adversary ofGerman designs;  nor can she, any  more than Hungary, afford to ignore theGerman market.  Alone Czechoslovakia is a  determined adversary of Berlin;and this is natural since her territorial integrity, indeed her very  existence  as;an independent State, is directly threatened.   Italy   will  emerge  from  the abyssinian conflict so weakened  that her  influence will  be of little account  inEurope for years to come.  To this extent the power of  Britain and France to contain Germany both  in the East and  Centre of Europe is likely to be much reduced, particularly in view of  the innate pacifism of the French masses.  all this affords a further argument for at least trying to come to terms with Germanybefore,  as  is otherwise eventually certain,  she  again takes  the law  into her own hands.     23.  A second observation to be made with regard to these German aims isthat certain of  them may be  prosecuted and fulfilled without war.  In North-Eastern Europe a German attack on Lithuania or the  other  Baltic States, on poland  or on Russia would almost certainly lead to armed resistance.   In MemelGerman armed  intervention  might provoke a,  conflict:  but equally  we cannotentirely discount the possibility  that Memel may  be  peacefully assimilated  orabsorbed.  Moreover, despite membership of the League, our people and others, too,seeing the size of the adversary and all that intervention would bring upon them,might deliberately  elect or need  to  blind themselves to what  force really is.Similarly, in South-Eastern Europe, Austria and, less  probably, parts of Czecho-slovakia might be  disrupted  from within,  and so devoured.  The economic and cultural penetration of the Baltic States,  parts of Russia and of the Danube
 Valley  could evidently be prosecuted  without war.   This form of  German dominance  in  the  Danubian  basin  has,  indeed,  long  been   a  fact.    To- some considerable  extent that penetration must operate  also  in  the Baltic- States and in Poland.   This is one of the master cards in the hands of Germany, and, as her strength increases, it will be played with increasing vigour and effect, for strength means attraction.  The brief day when it was possible to believe that in Central Europe German influence  could&quot; be effectively countered  by that of France or Italy or Britain is past.  We are already at a disadvantage.  Sanctions, mutual guarantee treaties, non-aggression pacts  and all the paraphernalia of resistance are unlikely to redress the balance.  It is not suggested that by coming- to terms with Germany we could prevent  this penetration.   What might be claimed, but without great confidence, is  that Britain and France would be better able than they are  at present to moderate and canalise  Germany&apos;s non-military influence in Central and Eastern Europe.     24.  There is yet  another consideration to be borne in mind.  In certain circumstances it is possible that Germany&apos;s policy of expansion in the  East might be carried on not against Russia,  but in co-operation with Russia.  The danger of such co-operation has for long  haunted many minds;  and there is abundant evidence to show that both in Germany and Russia it has  many advocates, especially in military and commercial circles.   Indeed, it has  also advocates in the German  Foreign Office.   The argument runs  that we shall not give their colonies back to them,  and that our League principles prevent us  from allowing them to overflow in Europe.  Therefore the policy of understanding with England will  lead to no tangible advantage and should be abandoned.  The  chief obstacle- in the way of a Russo-German reconciliation is the personal hatred of Herr Hitler for  the Bolshevik regime,  and the fact that he loses no opportunity of emphasising  its fundamental  incompatibility  with National Socialism.   But personal prejudices, even those of a dictator, cannot always resist altered circum- stances.  It,was largely in order to guard against this possibility that the French Government,  after much misgiving, decided last  year to conclude the  Franco- Russian Treaty.  It is doubtful whether any French politician,   still  less any French  soldier, really expected military advantages from  this treaty.  Its object was  primarily to prevent the Russian Government from  making to Herr Hitler advances  which  the latter  might  be  tempted  to  reciprocate.    In  present circumstances it is unlikely  that  any Bolshevik  blandishments would  move the Chancellor.   But  the reverse is not equally  true.   If he were to beckon to the Russian Government, there is a strong possibility that they might  step forward without thought  for either the obligations or  the advantages of  the Franco-Russian  Treaty.   Thus the initiative  in  any policy of Russo-German co-operation lies with Herr Hitler,  and it behoves us to consider the circumstances- in which he might be inclined to take it.  He  would be most likely to do so in the event of his convincing himself that he was being threatened by  encirclement. He might equally do so, if a policy of too prolonged drift on the part of Britain and France led him to conclude that he could hope for nothing from either of them.. If this  is correct, an Anglo-French  settlement with Germany would be a more effective guarantee against the dangers of Russo-German co-operation than the^ present Franco-Russian Treaty standing by itself.  It might, in fact, be argued that,  if Britain and France wished to  keep  Germany and  Russia apart,  they cannot  hope  to do  so  merely  by  influencing Russia;  they must  also persuade Germany to co-operate  with the Western Powers.    25.  In Western Europe territorial  problems  are, since  the final settlement of the Saar problem, ostensibly stabilised  Herr Hitler  has publicly renounced any claim to Alsace-Lorraine, and,  though his sincerities vary, he probably means this  for some time  at least.   Apart  from  Schleswig the only other  possible territorial danger-point in the  West lies in the two small provinces  of Eupen and Malmedy.  Were Herr  Hitler prepared  to abandon publicly all claim  to these districts as well, such action would be to our advantage.   The material fact for us is that, if there were later  a quarrel  between Germany and Belgium for the possession of these German-speaking districts,  we  too might  be drawn in underthe Locarno Treaty, though it  is no real  interest of this country, nor,  indeed, of Belgium, to fight in order  that they should remain indefinitely Belgian.    26.   The continued demilitarisation of the  Rhineland is the clearest remain-ing instance of the  denial of &quot;equality&quot; to Germany.  It is at least as much
-a question  of  prestige as of military necessity,  though it undoubtedly affectsGerman recruiting.  Herr Hitler has not, so far, definitely raised the issue, but itclearly cannot be indefinitely deferred.   At an earlier and less threatening stage-on the 30th  January,  1934-he stated  in  the  Reichstag that &apos;&apos; the  GermanGovernment are ready and determined, after the solution of the Saar question, toaccept both the spirit and the letter of the Locarno Pact.&quot;  On  the other hand,when Germany was growing stronger, he told the French Ambassador in Berlin(in  February 1935) that the demilitarised zone  could  not be eternal.  again in   his  speech  of  the  21st   May   occurs the   passage:   &quot;The   GermanGovernment will   observe  and   fulfil  all  obligations arising  out  of  the locarno  Pact   so  long  as  the  other  parties  are  willing  to stand  by  it.The German Government regard  the observance of the  demilitarised zone as avery difficult contribution for a sovereign State to make to the  appeasement ofEurope.   They  consider  that they  must refer to the fact that the continuedincrease of troops on the other side is in no way to be regarded as supplementingthese  endeavours.&quot;   Once  again  strength  and  candour  waxed, and on  the14th December,  1935, Baron von Neurath told Sir E. Phipps that, if the Frenchwanted the completion of an air  pact by bilateral arrangements, the demilitarised zone would  have to disappear : and  the Chancellor added, crudely, that he couldwell have reoccupied it without provoking war a  phrase to  be noted -on the16th March, 1935.   &quot; The humiliation  involved by this instance of discriminationwill have to disappear,&apos;&apos; recently declared an important member of the Nazi partyin close touch with Hitler though no date can yet be assigned to the operation.     27.  From  the  Franco-British  standpoint the  General Staff and  the AirStaff still rightly consider the zone to represent a delaying factor in any landoffensive against France  and Belgium.  From the point of view of Germany&apos;sdefences, the zone undoubtedly represents a definite&quot; disadvantage, as it restrictsGermany&apos;s power to organise resistance to a French offensive in the Rhineland incase of  any German  aggression  in  Central or Eastern  Europe.  With  themilitary strength of GermaiTy increasing,  with some corresponding measures atleast on our own  part and that of France,  is there not  indeed an increasinglikelihood that the German Government will say  they cannot  any longer admit the continuance of  this unequal situation ?     28.  Whatever  we do,  the  present situation as  regards  the demilitarisedRhineland is not likely to persist indefinitely; indeed the zone has probably beenviolated  already.  There  is therefore something to be said  for the view that  anearly attempt to come to terms with Germany can only render  it less likely thatthis dangerous  question will be  thrust forward in an aggressive and dangerousmanner.   This  is a  cogent reason for  weighing early the possibilities of aj^ree-ment, since  the  crisis may here be upon us soon,  and we have been  warned  bySir G. Clerk that the French Government will then expect of us duties which weare unable either to repudiate  or to fulfil.   In point of fact, that descriptionmight also well apply to the French public.     29.  The other great question directly at issue between Britain, France andGermany is  that of the colonies.  Germany&apos;s claim to recover her lost  Empireoverseas  is based on considerations, first, of prestige, and, secondly, of allegedeconomic necessity.   At the Berlin meeting on the 25th March, 1935, Herr Hitlerhinted at the first aspect of the German claim.   Germany,  he  suggested, wouldbe in a position of inequality and inferiority so long as colonies were denied to herand she  was regarded as unfit  to administer them  (&quot;the  colonial guilt lie&quot;).Dr. Schacht, the present economic dictator of Germany, has persistently laid stress on the second aspect of the claim, the need for Germany to own  tropical territorywhence to obtain raw materials without having  to  find foreign  exchange withwhich to pay for them.  But it is the sentimental side of the question which makesmost appeal to the German colonial societies and the general public.  Germany, itis said, has no &apos;&apos; elbow-room &apos;&apos; (and. she has always used her elbows); colonies&apos; area proper attribute of great Powers,  of which  Germany is now  again undeniablyone; and in  any case there is the governing slogan :  &apos;&apos; What ivas German mustbecome German.&quot;   It must be  remembered,  however, that  the recovery of thecolonies is regarded  in Nazi circles as complementary to, and in no way exclusive of,  eastward depredations.   There are,  in fact, two schools of  thought where
German expansion is concerned.  The school of Dr. Schacht advocates primarilyexpansion overseas, and that of the Reichswehr and of the inner circles of the nazi  party  believes  primarily, though less openly, in expansion  in  Europe aswell.   A victory by  the colonial school would not therefore be likely to satisfy the continental school, and vice versa.  Germany, in fact, never has been, andtherefore  may well never be,  satisfied.   At  present the situation  is that eachschool will continue  to press for its solution and refuse to be content with thatof the other.    30.  As for the extent of the colonial claims, it has been  insinuated insome  quarters that Germany would desire only the cession of some territory in africa producing raw material.  But His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador  at  Berlin haswarned us that Germany will accept in  the long run nothing less than theretrocession of the whole of her former colonial Empire.  Moreover, the facts setforth  in the two Foreign Office memoranda (&quot; German Colonial Aspirations &quot; and&quot;Germany  and the Portuguese  Colonies&apos;5) furnish  strong  ground  for theassumption that German colonial appetites will  not be finally assuaged even bythe re-acquisition of all the colonial territory that once was  German, and that,once her former Empire had been restored, it would not be long before somethingwas heard of &quot; Germany&apos;s inalienable right &quot; to the possessions of others.    31.  It  is important to notice  that (though France is, of  course, also con-cerned) the  German  Government at present regard this question as one  mainly of Anglo-German relations one, in fact, which can only be  settled &quot;with andnot against&quot; Britain, though more defiant notes are now beginning to be struck,revealing the intent  of ultimate compulsion.  Ere long we shall find Germanyhammering  the table when  she speaks and that  stage  is no longer  distant.At  present  Germany&apos;s  desire for good  relations  with  this  country,  andrecognition  of the obvious fact that British public opinion would resent any demand for  the cession of British territory, have combined to deter the GermanGovernment from bringing the question  to  any  official head.   The  interviewsbetween Sir E.  Phipps and  Dr.   Schacht and Herr Hitler on  the 5th  and13th December  leave, however,  no  doubt  that we must expect the  claim  soon tobe seriously advanced.    32.  The  attitude  hitherto   observed  by  His  Majesty&apos;s   Governmentwith  regard to this  matter has been that they  are  not prepared to consideror  discuss  the  cession or  transfer to   Germany  of  any  of the  territories under  British mandate; still  less has there been any  question of the  cessionor transfer to Germany of purely British  territory or of the property of others.The  arguments against  colonial   cession  are  familiar  and  need  not  berecapitulated. The principal argument on the other side has hitherto been that by  this means we should have removed  a direct potential  difference between ourselves and Germany; and that,  in the words used by Herr Hitler to Sir john simon in Berlin last  March, Germany would be &apos;&apos; engaged &apos;&apos; by such action, andwould then &quot;blindly  and loyally  fulfil  her  undertakings.&quot;   Presumably the&quot;undertakings&quot;  which we should  require from Germany would be that she should return to the League of Nations,  agree to some  further  limitation ofarmaments,  and make no further claims  upon us overseas; and that in central and Eastern as in  Western Europe she would refrain from all disturbance andadventure.    To this it might  be  replied that Germany would  probably notobserve these &quot; undertakings,&quot; however explicit and binding, and that the oppor-tunity for expansion in Africa as indicated above-might well not abate herexpansionist designs in Europe, since the little we could give her (Tanganyika,Togoland  and the  Cameroons) might only serve  to whet her  appetite.   But if germany will not keep her word, and if colonies  will neither abate the extent ofher demands in Europe nor alter  the manner of satisfying those demands, weshall  obviously have either to  fight or surrender.  That, however, would be  acounsel of despair, and it should surely  not be  assumed unless and until thealternative has been fully weighed in all  its bearings, which are  indeed, evenwider than those summarised above.  They will be dealt with in the conclusionsof this memorandum.    33.  We have two alternative  policies  before us as regards  the  colonialquestion.   We could  publicly declare  once more  that no  British  possessionor  mandated  territory is  for disposal.   If we  decide to  take  that  course,.
 there  is no  prospect of reaching  any real agreement  with Germany.  Alter- natively,  we  could  (with  the agreement of the  Dominion Governments,  the League of Nations and the other Powers concerned, for we neither should  nor could act alone) meet the German claim by the retrocession of some or all of the former German colonies.  If the second policy were recognised to be necessary, we could first consider the German  claim and the claims  of the other  &apos; *&apos; hungry Powers on the lines  indicated  in Sir  S. Hoare&apos;s speech  at Geneva on  the llth September, and confirmed in the Prime  Minister&apos;s  speech  at  the annual meeting of the  Peace  Society on the 31st October. A  fact-finding  commission might be established at Geneva to enquire into  questions  of population,  the development of backward countries, raw  material and  colonies.  By means of such a shelter, for it will prove to be no more, the real question whether Germany is or is not  to  have back her  former  colonies could be considered with more leisure and dignity,  that is  to say,  in the event of  Germany  developing her  full claim in 1936.   And by this means  also restitution, if it  came at all, would come as it should, that is by way of Geneva.     34.  Lastly, we  must not  ignore   the  repercussions  of   the economic situation  on  Germany and our power to  influence  it.  By the  Commercial Agreement of the 13th April/3rd May, 1933, and by the Payments Agreement of the 10th August, 1934, His  Majesty&apos;s Government  and the German  Government have gone a considerable way towards regulating  the commercial relations of the two countries  along liberal lines;  and,         result of  these Agreements,  a considerable  amount of trade continues  to be  done and  payments are  now regularly collected.  The  Payments Agreement is  based upon a  ratio between German exports to the United Kingdom and German imports from  the united Kingdom of 10 to 5-5. If the former are diminished the latter are almost bound to shrink.  If the United Kingdom is to  retain  the large measure  of influence and the considerable measure of friendship which it still has in commercial and financial circles in Germany, it is essential that trade should not  be  reduced by deliberate action on our part, i.e., by raising tariffs, if it can possibly  be avoided. It is possible that the future may provide more  positive openings for Great Britain  to assist in  Germany&apos;s  economic recovery,   although  we must  be exceedingly cautious in applying them, for, if  we apply them too soon, we and all  Europe will suffer.  At  present such  openings do not anyhow provide any short cut to  a solution of the German problem, but their connexion with  the problem must not be forgotten or ignored.  The insistent German claim for export markets is in itself a not unreasonable one;  and it is impossible  to look  at  the steadily declining figures of  German exports during the last seven  years without reflecting that here is to be found one of the reasons, though not the main reason, for the demand for  &quot; expansion.&quot;   We may or  may  not be able to meet  this demand by any direct action on our  part;  but at least  we can see ^iaf  the situation  is not aggravated yet further by  additional restrictions  on^German export trade, except in cases of pressing need in our own industries.  E\ entually, the problem  may be solved by the  creation and recognition of  some kind of &quot;special area&quot; for  German economic expansion in Central Europe; and here it should be noted that the foundations  of  such an area are even  now being laid by  the  creation of  &quot;clearing agreements&quot;  which,  in fact, result  in a preference being given to German goods.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have so  far only protested formally against these arrangements; and, indeed,  provided that it takes place gradually and pacifically in  such ways as  this, it is not too much to say that the establishment of a &quot; special area&quot;  for Germany in this part of the world might actually be an objective of British policy, seeing  that it  might bring about some, although not a great, relief of  tension.    Two points must, however, be made perfectly  plain.   One is that  no commercial facilities alone will ever satisfy &quot;A People without Room&quot; stoked to fever heat  and artificial fertility.  The second is that we cannot possibly, in the existing state  of Europe,make any statements of renunciation in Central Europe, for such action would produce panic and a political  landslide.   In other  words,  an economic solutioncannot precede a political solution, of which it is only a part,  and the easier and less dangerous part to boot.    35.  Meanwhile, there is  a number of obvious arguments in  favour  of  an early exploration of  all the  ways and means  of  coming to  terms  withGermany.  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  have by their  recent  policy secured
in  a  certain  measure  the  moral  leadership  of  Europe,  and  it  may  beexpected  that  this  leadership  will  be turned,  to some  account in  relieving the present tension.   (If this prove impossible, another and more inconvenientkind  of  leadership will  also  be  expected  of  us.)   At  the  same  time,there are  indications that Herr Hitler,  divided between  Nazi  theories andeconomic necessities, is hesitating as to the direction along which he should launchGermany&apos;s future foreign policy.  At such a moment of indecision a strong lineby His Majesty&apos;s Government would be a decisive factor.   Again,  if we wait until Germany &apos;s rearmament is much nearer completion and there is not  far to go her aspirations may become definite demands, which will not allow of anycompromise or bargaining.   She may,  moreover,  soon  become more  difficult to treat with, owing to  some development in Austria or Italy, or even to some changein France, which will strengthen her position.  In spite of Herr Hitler&apos;s presentunresponsive attitude,  it is  probable &apos; that he still  in principle  wants  better relations with us on conditions; but we have no guarantee that this dispositionwill continue.  Indeed, if no result is reached, we may assume the contrary.    36.  On the other hand,  the strongest,  and perhaps the decisive, argument against being hurried is the fact that in many respects we are, in the matter of most armaments and all munitions, already dangerously weaker than Germany.Bargains  can be better  driven when one is strong than when one  is weak.  we ought not to try to secure a bargain with Germany until we  have at least madea  strong  and notorious beginning  on  the requirements  of  the  new  defence requirements Committee&apos;s Report a beginning sufficiently decisive and visibleto show that we mean business, which many people, including the Germans, stillconsider themselves to have valid grounds for  disbelieving on  our own showingno less than on their own information.  We need not, of course, wait until these requirements are completed.  That  would take far too long, and  the  psycho-logical moment would then have passed.  But we should lose  nothing by puttingourselves into a better posture, since Herr Hitler himself has made it plain thathe intends to play a waiting game.  Furthermore, in trying to negotiate a settle-ment we must always bear in mind the likelihood of failure in view of the probableheight of Hitler&apos;s price.  If we were thus to fail while still in a state of militaryweakness,  our position would be highly dangerous, since in the process of tryingwe  should have alienated many.  We  should  have failed to  bring  off a dealwith Germany, and should have aroused either the suspicions or the resentmentof almost  all the other  frightened and irritable  Powers in Europe.  Not only,.therefore,  must we be prepared for failure, but we must be already strong enoughto face it.   That is  a point of the highest importance.    37. Again Hitler  would have been far  more likely  to be reasonable andforthconaing  in negotiation  if faced  by the Stresa unity.  It is  to  the recentdisintegration of this &quot;front&quot; that we must in  large measure  attribute the sudden  change of tone shown in his recent  interviews with the British andFrench Ambassadors. The success therefore of any new approach would be largelyconditioned by  our relations with France,  and even with  Italy if we had anyto speak of, or if there  is anything much left of her during these crucial years.Even in the case of  France, there is now a lot of leeway to make up, and some-time and care will be necessary to get on a footing conducive to the successfulconduct of any such delicate and necessarily, joint operation.  For it would be essential to carry France with us.  We cannot safely admit  that French policyin Europe should  differ widely from  our own.   Under Locarno we  are not in theory committed to her support in the  event of war  between France andGermany arising out of the commitments of the former to her easterly allies.   Butin practice we cannot escape the fact  that our vital interest a more formidableand compelling thing than any casus fcederis would not permit us to be  silentwitnesses  of the establishment of Germany in Belgium  and Northern France asa result of France becoming involved in a war which had started without us in theCentre or East of Europe.  We are therefore directly interested in France&apos;s policyin Central and Eastern Europe.  This does not mean that we must follow Frenchpolicy in those regions, but,  on the contrary, that we should bring  it into accord with our own.    38.  The argument may  be summed up as follows :  (1)  That it would be-.well to come to terms with Germany if possible; (2) that we might begin the-
      !   .  /approaches to the general through a chosen category of the particular;  (3) thatwe should do well to begin these approaches in good time, lest the&apos; psychologicalmoment pass, and in some respects it already shows signs of transience;  (4) thatwe  cannot begin the  approach  to the  general  till  we are materially in  a stronger position than we are now,  and that therefore, to keep Germany in play,we could fill in the interval by the approach to the particular;  (5) that we shouldon no account undertake approaches which will compromise us and cause generalperturbation in Europe,  unless  we are firmly determined to succeed;  (6) that wehave no chance of succeeding in anything but self-deception, unless we have made up our minds in advance to face reality, and unless we have also recognised thatthe reality is (7) that no lasting bargain can be made with present-day germany without  the  payment  of  a  high  price that  is, provision  for  territorialexpansion;  (8) that we cannot immorally seek that price, or connive at its being sought, at  the expense of others, that is, in Europe;  (9) that were we to lendourselves to  such  projects  we should rightly  forfeit all our reputation  andfriendships, betray the principles of the League, and ultimately be  left alone withan unsated and stronger foe;  (10) that such expansion can therefore only beprovided at our own expense, that is, in Africa by the restitution of the formercolonies  of Germany.   Unless we are prepared to face these facts, we should notdelude ourselves into thinking  that a real,  as opposed to a paper, agreement  ispossible.  It would pay us ill to upset Europe, and make  the worst of two worlds,during the two crucial years ahead of us by embarking upon  soundings that canonly lead to shipwreck.  I write in terms of a bargain because I  believe that  tobe the mentality of Hitler&apos;s Germany.   That such a bargain should be brought under the aegis of the League goes without saying; we should, in fact,  be renderinga service to the League  by making for the first time that  hitherto impossibleArticle XIX the reality  that it must become if the League is to survive.    39.  If we are not prepared to face these facts, I would also urge that weshould not halt between two opinions, as we have been compelled, perhaps wisely,to do in the past.  We are at the  parting of the ways, and there is no longer anytime to lose.   We must know exactly whither we are going, and direct our policyaccordingly, not hesitating to work with those who may be of  even temporary use to us, and those who,  even willy-nilly, are in the same boat for the nonce or ageneration.  (We must aixyhow make the best of those who are our  boat-fellows,and give up talking or thinking of  each other as pro-this or anti-that because weare wise enough to  do  so,  nor should we criticise or  belittle them too much,remembering that they do the same by us, and that  if we all  start in that spiritwe shall not get far.)   Let me give a concrete example of what I mean.  We have before us the urgent question whether Russia, and our trade with  Russia, shouldbe assisted by credits or a  loan; and the advocates of a rapprochement  withGermany have urged that the former solution  should be  selected,  lest the latter,vcoupled  with  the ratification of the Franco-Soviet Agreement, be  interpreted byGermany as an indication  that  we are  throwing in  our lot with  France  and russia.  Surely, the answer on grounds of high policy as distinct from technical-considerations is that we should first ask ourselves whether  we intend to bringGermany back into the comity of nations at a price to which  neither Russia noranyone else can legitimately object,  that is by the restitution of  the  german colonies.  If the answer is &quot; Yes,&quot; the answer should clearly be credits.  If the answer is &quot; No,&quot; there is no reason to boggle at a loan, for there will anyhow beno prospect of settling with Germany, and we may then  take whichever course  is most  compatible with our other interests.  Opinions  may vary as to the degree of urgency that the colonial question possesses in German eyes; but illustrations suchas the foregoing show that there is continual urgency  in making up our own minds.    40,  A negative answer to this key-question has, of  course, many other andmore serious implications.  I have  for long maintained that Germany could notbe counted upon to refrain  from  attempting to disturb the status  quo for longer than  1936 and 1937- this in contrast with the view that she  could not be readytill 1942.  I do not now  believe that we can be quite sure of even this delay; and,I shall be the less inclined to such a belief the longer the Italo-Abyssinian conflictendures.  The present French vieAV is that Germany will be ready for trouble ineighteen months, and  that heavily armed States do not always wait  till they are ready.   This is, I think, not far from the truth.  Moreover, internally Nazismhas been a nearly complete  failure.  The extent of the failure is rarely grasped.    &apos;  ) \      f
 It has disappointed most expectations, fulfilled few hopes,  except those centred on military strength.   General Goering spends  millions,  but  the  people are hungry and discontented, and  the miners are working at  23s. a week,  though Dr.  Schacht has  promised them that by 1939  they will have attained  such a position of military predominance as to make it all worth while.  Meanwhile, the Chancellor is deliberately working for over-population, and this alone must bring about an ultimate explosion.  Hitler, no less, indeed more greatly than, Mussolini, may soon find himself in  that grip of circumstance where adventure becomes, like most human proceedings, an imaginary obligation.  This is also the apprehension of the older and  more moderate Germans whom  I  have met.   And  this new Germany is not only  far  the most powerful  State in Europe; she has nothing to lose, for she has no friends, and therefore no restraints.  Moreover, owing to the late date of starting our own re-equipment (and our associates in the League have not even begun to think of starting yet),  it is now inevitable that Germany will be ready for aggression, long before we and the League can be ready for defence. If, therefore, we are to turn our backs on conciliation-and this will be our last opportunity we must at least get as far as we can in  the short time still ahead of us.  With this  in view we must double-bank our own preparations, and by the force of our exainple see to it that the same is done by all members of the League of Nations, including even, to the utmost of their abilities, the smaller eunuch- States, that are most interested in the maintenance of the status quo and  least disposed to  effective contribution where the aggressor is a heavy-weight.  This is the real meaning of collective security.  The aggressor will be located in advance  there is no longer a doubt  in  Europe as to his eventual identity and the only chance of restraining him will be that the collective  strength of the  potential victims should be  twice as great in spirit and in truth, and not only on  paper. And these general preparations must be the more thorough in that the  apparent policy of the American Government, the certain desire of the American people, is at all costs to avoid discrimination between right and wrong, and to subject the victim to. the same ban as the  spoliator. (5)  Prospective spoliators are  always prepared.  Prospective victims can do no less.  We nearly lost the last war with vast supplies from the United States of America,  Without  such help we  should lose the next one,  unless  we  and our associates are ready to face it on our own resources.    41.  Germany is determined to have her colonies back at some stage :  Schacht, Goebbels,  Voretzsch have convinced Hitler  of this other imaginary  obligation, and the retention,  under mandate, of colonies without which we got on quite well before 1914, seems no  longer to correspond with realism.  We  have, in word  at least, recognised Italian claims to expansion; we are, in fact, winking at Japanese expansion^ to Germany, nearer  and more  dangerous, we have hitherto  conceded neither word nor deed.  But even if we are prepared to forestall this appetite by cession, no one, it  must be in all honesty repeated, can guarantee that the cession will be treated as more than a hors oVozuvre.  Indeed, many of those best  qualified to judge will say emphatically,  and with  much show of reason, that this will be the only result, so long as Germany is imbued with the subjugating &quot; Mission,&quot; which President Roosevelt recently condemned.  Indeed, I take full account of this possibility,  for I  have already  pointed out in the conclusion of my  paper- No. CP. 104/34 of the 7th April, 1934, that  there can  be no guarantee  of peace short of a complete reform of the German spirit as therein set forth;  and of  that I see no sign whatever on the  contrary,  the  spirit is worse.  As to the colonies the odds are indeed distinctly against a restitution  proving sufficient to maintain peace in the long run.  To quote Mein Kampf again : &apos;&apos; See  that the strength ofour nation has its basis not in colonies but in home territory in Europe.   But ifwe talk to-day of new land and territory in Europe we can, in the first place, only think of Russia and of the subject limitrophe States.&quot;  I believe that Hitler&apos;mind is still haunted by rough and unready schemes for coupling the dismember- ment  of  Russia with a, free hand for Japan north of  the Yangtse and some temporary assurance for the British Empire.   In any case he is bent on expansion in Europe.  None the less, I would urge that, on balance, advantage lies in making one serious attempt, even if it can only be made in one unpalatable way, to change-   (5) America will  always find reasons for doing nothing, since  these are always the easiestto find.  One of them will be the alleged injustices of the Peace Settlement, and above all_thelack of elasticity in revising it.  See, for example, the writings of  Mr. Frank Sbmonds, passim.
 his mind  if possible, and to  secure peace  for  the world by postponing a crisis; for the essential thing is that we should gain time, and things postponed have a way of not happening.   Moreover in regard  to the colonies  the Germans  have a legitimate grievance;  and no sane person looking at the distribution of the World&apos;s surface can really believe  that it will  endure.   (I should parenthetically make it clear  that I am only speaking of colonies in Africa, and only  of  a transfer   of  mandate insufficient   though  Germany  will   call  that owing to  the difficulties  in&apos; the  way  of any  other  course  (see  footnote).)   It may  truly  be  pointed  out  that   we   tried  to  conciliate  Germany  before 1914 in  vain; and that  we were  strong  before 1914 in  vain.   To this  I would answer that apart from the  fact  that we were only  strong at sea we have now two  assets which the  world did not possess  before  1914 : we have  a foreign policy7 automatically declared by  virtue of our membership of the League, aild by that same  virtue we have automatic associates or allies if we  can make men of them in the name of the  new  revolution in foreign policy.  It should not bo taken for granted without trial that  all these elements, the old and  the  new, taken in conjunction are bound  to fail.  Nothing of the kind  has ever yet  been tried, because it has never yet -existed.   But  all these elements in  conjunction cannot succeed, if we  attempt  to stand  for  ever on  a rigid,  and in reality unjustifiable, status quo.  Indeed, we are committed to resist by  sanctions the modification by force of  the  status quo; and sanctions in the case of  Germany mean  war, a land  war.   Surely, therefore,  we should begin to enlighten our own public not only on the advantages, but the risks, of the policy of collective security, and therefore on the need  for armaments; this is indeed  a crying necessity, to which  the Defence Requirements  Committee called  urgent attention two y^ears ago.   If we fail to do this we  may eventually&apos; have in  this country  the same reluctances and confusions as France has experienced at the prospect of a  land war with Italy.  If our people realised all this,  I think they would  welcome some elasticity  in the status quo.   &quot; Great Britain,&quot; said  General  Goering on the 23rd January, 1936, &quot; of course desires peace in view of her world-wide Empire; but, if it is to be merely7 a peace by maintaining indefinitely the  status  quo,  that policy will fail.  Germany does not want  war; but if in the course  of time her just demands prove  unobtainable  by peaceful means, then,  terrible as it is to  con- template,  war seems  inevitable.&quot;   And less than  a month before,  Hitler was writing  that  the  attempt   to   maintain  an integral  status  quo   &quot; could only   end  in   a   colossal   catastrophe.&quot;   It  is  surely   because   in   our hearts  we  know   this   to  be  true that  we  have  often  proclaimed  how we  stand  for  and  on   nothing   rigid  or  unalterable although   that  is what  Europe now expects  of us,  and what Germany  has always said of the League, and has said increasingly since the beginning of the Italo-V^byssinian conflict. We have publicly declared that  the League must be dynamic, not static. *&apos; If the League,&quot; said the Prime Minister on the 31st October, 1935, &quot; only exists to keep things  as  they are, it will become desiccated and crumble  into dust&quot; (and this  sentence made  a deep  impression  upon  Hitler).   The difficulty is to find the  point on  the  globe  where  these  principles   can  be   applied. Count  Reventlow,  a  combination  of  Nationalist, Junker and  lleo-pagan,  has recently written a  tome entitled &quot;  AVhere -is God?&quot;   At the end of all the high- stepping verbiage we have only been told of some half-dozen hitherto conceivable places where He is not.  It is the same with geographical elasticity.  At whatever point we touch  the globe, it is not  there.   Some of us, for example, at least  had    N.B. A transfer by agreement of a mandate from His Majesty&apos;s  Government to  Germany, by which Germany would succeed us as  mandatory and hold the territory  subject to the same conditions as we did,  should  not present any procedural difficulties, since  in  our  view all that would be required, in addition to the agreement between  the two countries,  would  be the assent of the Council of the League, which in the circumstances could presumably be obtained. But a return of the territory  to Germany as  a  colony  which she was to hold in  full  sovereignty  and free from the mandatory  restrictions would present most serious difficulties.  It would be quiteinconsistent  with  Article 22  of the Covenant,  and would therefore appear to require an amendment  of that article.   Such an  amendment would be very  difficult to  obtain, because (1) strong objection would be felt in principle  to the abandonment.of the mandatory principle and to Germany being  given  a free hand in  such matters as the military training  of the natives; (2) under the mandate all the members of the League are entitled to commercial equality  andwould be reluctant to  abandon it.  Moreover, the  United States might object  stronglv to  any arrangement which deprived  them of the commercial rights  which, under arrangements  with His Majesty&apos;s Government, they at present possess in the mandated territories.
    (0) &quot;There is no reason to believe that Herr Hitler&apos;s basic, ideas, as set forth in that book,have materially altered.&quot; (Sir E. Phipps, December ID, 1935.)played with the idea that a beginning might be made upon the regime of theDardanelles; but even here it is easy to demonstrate that, by taking any initiative,we should lose more at the swings than we could win at the roundabouts.  And yetwe really mean what  we say; and that brings us back to Africa.  If neither thedevastations of experience, nor strength nor justice  nor generosity in others, nor,above all, a combination of all these, can avail to deter Germany from attemptingonce more to wrench the world to suit her book and her book is still Mein Kampfunpurged((!) if the clouds must indeed return after the rain, then our civilisationis doomed. Its only chance of survival is to avoid a fresh and final test.   before we make our final decision, however, let us see things exactly as they are.  I would say  definitely  that the present rulers  of  Germany  are bent  upon  eventualadventures which will be almost certain to unleash a European war.   What we-can do is to gain time, hoping against hope that  there may be some change ofheart or system in  Germany, or with better ground that we and  our Leagueassociates may within  a respite of x years, with energy,  virility  and  muchpropaganda, grow to a position where defence can make attack too hopeless to be worth while.  But no  member of the League has embarked on this course in time,and Germany  will be  ready before the  League.  This is the whole essence of thefuture.   That gap  in time has  somehow to  be bridged.  Would not a colonialrestitution, as  part of  a reasonable and  comprehensive  settlement, reached in collaboration with France, and concluded at Geneva, justifiable in any case, bedoubly so if no other bridging material can be devised ?    42.  I would resume this memorandum very briefly as follows :  In whateverway we approach the German problem we shall be brought up  against the colonialquestion at an early stage.  We can approach it through an enquiry at Genevainto  the distribution  of raw materials.  That  could be  set on foot at a fairlyearly date, and the  enquiry would cover some of the time needed to demonstrateour own determination to rearm.  Or we could (indeed, we shall have to) examine in conjunction with France the possibility of a peaceful disappearance  of the demilitarised zone;  or we could make another serious attempt to conclude an air pact and an Air  Limitation Agreement.   But by  whatever category  we set theball rolling towards the general problem, we may be sure that the colonial question will crop up, and further progress will be impossible until it is answered.&quot; when that  position is reached,  we should, in conformity with  the  view expressed inparagraph 29,  make  it plain  that we  cannot answer it  affirmatively  except inreturn for an undertaking by Germany to return to the League, to  agree to aserious measure of armament limitation, and to make no further territorial claims in Africa or in Europe.   I myself still  incline as a matter of tactics to makingthe preliminary approach to Germany in conjunction with France (and Italy, ifthe approach is made by way of an air agreement); but  the point will soon bereached when it will be clear either that no general settlement is possible or that thediscussions must be taken to Geneva.  There the real settlement must be threshedout and concluded, provided that the members of the League face the fact that no-durable peace with  Germany is possible unless they  are liberal enough to depriveher of at least part of her grievance-mongering and strong enough to make herrealise that a settlement will be better for her  than aggression.    I have discussed  this memorandum with Sir E. Phipps  and he is in entire agreement with it.                                               ROBERT  VANSITTART.    Foreign Office,  February 3, 1936.
