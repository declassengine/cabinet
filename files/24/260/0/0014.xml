At their Meeting on November 27th,  1935 (Cabinet 49(35)Conclusion 10) the Cabinet agreed :       (a) that a Cabinet Committee composed as           follows :-             The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (In the Chair)             The Lord Chancellor             The Home Secretary             The Lord Privy Seal             The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries             The Minister of Health             The Attorney General             should be appointed to advise on the Reports             of the Royal Commission on Tithe Rentcharge             and to report to the Cabinets if possible,             in time for a decision to be  taken as to the             Government&apos;s policy before Parliament rises;       (b) that in the meantime publication of the           Commission&apos;s Reports should be  postponed.2.     Owing to the necessity for confidential consultationwith the Local Authorities and the Authorities of the church of England, it was not possible to submit  the Committee^Conclusions to the Cabinet before Parliament adjourned onDecember 20th last.   The House of Commons have recently beeninformed by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries that theGovernment will publish the Report of the  Royal Commission as soonas possible and that  at the same time the  Government  will issue a statement of their policy in regard thereto.3.     We attach a proof copy of the Report of the  RoyalCommission (Annex I).    The more important  proposals  of theMajority and Minority Reports are explained and summarised in  theAppendix to the Memorandum (Paper CP.  210  (35))  circulated  to theCabinet on the 22nd November last by the  Chancellor of  the                            -1-
Exchequer and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.4.     We agree with the Royal Commission that it is desirable in the public interest that the controversy between titheownersand tithe payers should be brought to an end, and in ouropinion the proposals submitted to the Cabinet in this Reportoffer the best practicable solution of the problem.5.     The legislation of 1934 broke down mainly because  ofthe very strong objection then raised by the tithe payers  tothe proposed change in the method of recovery.  This change,which is unanimously recommended by the Royal Commission, isof course a fundamental and inevitable consequence of theCommission&apos;s proposals that the annuities should be collected by the Inland Revenue on State account.  Against any renewal of this opposition must be set the substantial advantages which the new scheme will afford to the tithe payers and whichare greatly in excess of the meagre benefits offered by theabortive Bill of 1934.   Put very briefly these advantagesconsist in the reduction of the existing liability of tithe-payers from  109ol0o0d. tithe rentcharge (par value) for  76years in the case of ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge and  from 105 tithe rentcharge (par value) in the case of lay titherentcharge to  91.1102d.  for a shorter limited period in both cases.  If our recommendations are accepted this shorter period will be 60 years and the actuarial relief to thetithepayers will be equivalent to 22a37% in the former case and 27o6% in the latter.    In addition the Commissionrecommend, and we agree,  that in every case where the titherentcharge exceeds one-third of the Schedule TB&apos;  assessment,the future liability of the tithepayer should be written  down to that amount,,   This concession is estimated to cost 200,000 a year, and in the opinion of the Royal Commission&quot;will meet the generality of what may be called &apos;hard cases&apos;                     -2-
195     The main point on which we differ from the Royal Commission is in regard to the -length of the period during which these reduced payments by the tithepayer are to be paid.   The Royal Commission thought it right that this period should he limited to forty years but they advanced no special reasons for this proposal, the effect of which, as they themselves admit is to leave the Exchequer exposed to very large additional liabilities, chiefly on account of the claim of the rating authorities for compensation on account of the loss of tithe rentcharge as a rateable hereditament, an inevitable consequence of the change of system proposed.   Further, although the Commission make no reference to the point, we cannot overlook the equitable claim of the Church to consideration on account of the heavy loss of income which will fall on benefice holders under the new scheme. The Royal Commission seem to have regarded these aspects of the question as falling outside their terms of reference (see e-g, footnote to page 4-6 of Report).    But the Government are bound to include them in their review of the whole situation, and from this wider standpoint we have been forced to conclude that the Commission&apos;s scheme is incomplete in certain most important respects   We have therefore attempted to enlarge and modify the Commission&apos;s scheme in such a manner as will provide comprehensively for the equitable claims of all the various interests concerned and so form,  as we hope,  the basis of a just and permanent settlement of  what the Commission describeas a secular controversy which has had regrettable social consequences *
6,     We have examined the proposals in the minority Report of Sir Leonard Coates,   Apart fromother objectioas, we are satisfied that these proposalswhich are even more unfavourable to the titheowners than Ithe terms suggested in the Majority Report,  and which appear to exceed the Commission&apos;s terms of reference,would prove quite unacceptable to both the ecclesiasticaand lay titheowners, and it seems to us extremely doubtful whether public opinion would regard them asfair and reasonable.   Accordingly we are unable torecommend the Cabinet to entertain Sir LeonardCoates&apos;  Minority recommendations.                                                        I7.     For convenience of reference the more important  1                                                        1recommendations of the Majority of the Royal Commission I                                                        1are summarised in Annex II of this Report.   As                                                        Ialready stated the Commission&apos;s Financial Statement                                                        Iquoted in paragraph (vi) of Annex II, makes no provision for two important liabilities, namely -(1) the claim of the Rating Authorities for compen-sation on account of the loss of tithe rentcharge asa rateable hereditament, and (2) the cost ofadministration and collection of the new RedemptionAnnuities.  At this stage of our enquiry theseliabilities were estimated provisionally at amountsbetween  500,000 and  650,000 per annum and            ; 120,000 per annum respectively, payable for 60                                                       Iyears, with appropriately larger annual amounts if     \the period of payment were shortened to 40 years.

This result followed from the Commission&apos;s recommendation that the period of payment of the new Tithe Redemption Annuitiesshould be limited to 40 years, thus imposing on the Tithe Redernp- tion Annuities Account a liability for Sinking Fund which was -out of proportion to the income available from the Annuities themselves.
19810*     The Royal Commission not only made no provision in their scheme for compensation to the Local Authorities,                            ahut their proposals involved/serious reduction of income for all titheowners and particularly for the holders ofbenefices whose income is derived wholly or mainly fromtithe rentcharge vested in Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty.   this reduction may be put at  330,000 per annum, or about18% of the Bounty&apos;s net income from tithe rentcharge.Alternative Scheme.11.     The Treasury then prepared for our consideration analternative scheme which, by requiring the tithe payers topay their annuities for 60 years instead of 40 (a periodconsiderably less than their existing obligations requirein regard to annual tithe rentcharge),  sought to achieve the following objects :-        (i) to provide a reasonable measure of compensationfor Local Authorities;       (ii) to provide if possible a margin, within thefinancial limits of the scheme, out of which some reliefmay be given, for a limited period at least, to holders of benefices;      (iii) to satisfy the condition which the Chancellorof the Exchequer has laid down as a cardinal principle, thatno additional net charge shall fall upon the taxpayer asthe result of the proposed change of system.12.   The Treasury&apos;s calculations at this stage showed thatit -would only be possible to achieve those three objectsby limiting the actuarial equivalent of the liabilitiesto be incurred, for compensation to the Local Authoritiesand for relief to the Benefice-holders  together, to a level annuity of  550,000 payable for 60 years.                    -6-
19013.     But the Immediate claims  both of the  LocalAuthorities and of the Church were far in excess  of this amount.   The immediate liss of income to the former alonewas estimated at approximately  900,000 per annum;   and toprovide a reasonable measure of relief it would be  necessaryto substitute for a level annuity of  X payable for 60 years,a series of payments starting with a&apos; figure as near to 900P000 as is reasonable and prudent, and graduallydiminishing.   These payments would be arranged on  such a scale that the present value of the whole series,  should be equal to the present value of  X per annum payable  for 60years.   The excess of the actual payments over  X  per annumduring the earlier years of the series would  have  to be met by borrowing;  and the Treasury were prepared to  provide thenecessary facilities for this, within the financial limits of the scheme.14.     In view of these considerations we decided  toascertain confidentially the views of the Local Authoritiesand the Church on the scheme of the Majority  of the RoyalCommission as modified by the Treasury plan.    Accordingly,at our request, the Minister of Health conferred  withrepresentatives of the Local Authorities, and the Lord privy seal communicated a copy of the draft Report  of the RoyalCommission, and a Memorandum explanatory of the Treasury plan,to the Archbishop of Canterbury,  with a suggestion  that heshould confer in confidence with  Sir George Middleton, theChairman of Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty.    The results of  these consultations may be stated as follows,15.     Prior to the negotiations with the Local  Authorities
we had hoped that a satisfactory settlement might hereached with the Authorities at a cost not exceeding,the payment from Public Funds of an annuity of  500,000for sixty years.   After protracted discussions betweenthe Minister of Health and his advisers and a Committeerepresenting the Local Authorities concerned, the latterhave agreed to recommend to their Executive Councilacceptance of an amended offer consisting of a diminishingscale of payments, the equivalent cost of which, to theExchequer will be  600,000 per annum for sixty years.16.     It is not necessary to trouble the Cabinet withthe details of this settlement, but one point requires to be mentioned.   The series of payments will start with the actual rate income derived from tithe rent-charge in the year 1955,    This figure, however, cannotbe ascertained for some months to come;  and consequently the exact scale of payments must remain undeterminedfor the present.-8--
201 Whatever  the initial  figure  proves  to he, however,  the scale will  start  from the point  so  determined,  and  will continue  according  to an agreed  formula until the sum of the whole series  is equivalent to a sixty years annuity of  600,000.    If  this point should he reached before  the descending  scale  has  reached zero,  payment of compensation v/ill stop at  the  point of equilibriums though on the most unfavourable  assumption this could  h;,rdly happen before 46 or  47  years.    The Local Authorities have asked that these facts  should  he placed on record, and that in the event of. the total income  from rates  on tithe rentcharge being found to  be  substantially in excess of the estimates available and the period  of the proposed grant substantially curtailed in  consequencej this  should be borne in mind if an applica- tion for  an ex  gratia extension  of  the period of grant be then made.   We agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that this request, which is unlikely to take effect  for approximately half a century, need not cause us  much anxiety, and we recommend the Cabinet to tgree to it. 17.   As regards the Church  Authorities, interviews have taken place between the Treasury and the Chairman of QxieenAnne&apos;s Bounty, who,  at the request   of the  Archbishop ofCanterbury3 has laid before the Chancellor  of the Exchequer the case of the Church Authorities for special consideration.here again, it is not  noce&amp;sary to trouble  the Cabinet  withdetails;  but in brief, the Church consider  that their  lossof income should be restricted to 10 per cent,  of theirpresent net  income, end that  in addition, full compensation should be provided for sitting incumbents.   The additional funds&apos; necessary  for this  purpose  over and above  those pro-vided by the recommendation  of  the Royal Commission  should,
202in the opinion of the Church Authorities, be obtained by increasing the standard rate of payments to be made bytithepayers  from  91.11.  2. per  100 tithe rentcharge parvalue oayable for 40 years to  97.15. 0. payable forsixty years as a general principle;  and to  105 in thecase of certain special classes of tithe payers.   Thefigure of  97.15. 0. is arrived at by taking the averageof corn prices on the seven years moving scale over thefull period of 100 years since 1836 instead of excluding the years of high prices during and after the War asproposed by the Royal Commission.18.     We think it quite impracticable for the Governmentto propose such drastic changes as this in the RoyalCommission&apos;s recommendations.   If, therefore, the tithe-payer is not to foot the bill, the cost of satisfying theChurch&apos;s claim would have to fall upon the Exchequer andwould cost approximately  275,000 per annum for sixty yearsinstead of  50,000 per annum for sixty years which was allthat it was thought the Treasury scheme could safely under-take.19.     This goes far beyond what the Chancellor of theExchequer deems right to ask the general taxpayer to-pay,or what the Exchequer can afford.   After careful consider-ation of all the circumstances, we agree with the Chancellorof the Exchequer that the utmost that can be done to meetthe appeal of the Church Authorities is to substitute forthe original offer a lump sum payment of  2  millions,
the cost of which in terms of a sixty-years annuity will he 73,266 per annum instead of the  50 ?000 originally proposed.,In announcing this decision the Government should express thehope that in making use of this money the Church will give special consideration to the claims of existing incumbents inreceipt of the smaller incomes who may be adversely affectedby the changes.20.   Thus, as the result of these discussions the Treasury were faced with an additional liability of  122,256 per annum forsixty years, for which no provision was made in the Treasury&apos;original calculations.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer, however,has informed us that, as the result of the change of systemrecommended by the Royal Commission, tithe payers in their capacity as landowners will become liable for higher assessments toSchedule A income tax, while certain classes of titheowners willalso be faced with an increase of their assessments under ScheduleD.   But the increase of revenue from this source was necessarilyspeculative in amount, and uncertain in its duration, and theChancellor of the Exchequer had previously deemed it too riskyto take it into account in making his calculations.  In so far asit might actually accrue to the Exchequer, he proposed to treatit as a reserve against the very grave contingent risks which theExchequer would undertake under the Royal Commission&apos;srecommendations.21.   Realising, however, that there is no other source fromwhich the additional liability referred to above can be.met, theChancellor of the Exchequer has now informed us that he isprepared to tase a more optimistic view of the increase of taxrevenue collectable in the manner indicated above.   Whether theresult will shew that this measure of optimism is justifiedremains to be seen:  but in all the circumstances the Chancelloris prepared, though reluctantly, to make the necessary assumption.The Cabinet are, however, warned that there will remain no marginwhatever for further concessions to the tithepajrer0                          -11-
22.     We favour acceptance of the recommendations of themajority of the Royal Commission as modified by the Treasuryproposals in the light of the negotiations with the Church andthe Local Authorities,   As already pointed out the maindifference between the Royal Commission and the Treasuryschemes is in the length of the period during which theRedemption Annuities are to be paid.  We hope that moderate opinion among the tithe payers will not take serious objectionto the increase of the annuity period from 40 to 60 years,and will regard as reasonable proposals which give immediaterelief in cash, as compared with the arrangements now in forceof 16*4% and 12^,8% in the case of ecclesiastical and laytithepayers respectively.   We also think that &quot;the criticisms of the tithe payers will be directed rather to the change inthe method of recovery than to other aspects of the proposals.As explained in paragraph 5 this change is a fundamental andinevitable feature of the unanimous recommendations of theCommission on the subject.23.     We are circulating to the Cabinet as a separatedocument (CP. 49.A (36)) the draft of a Command Paperembodying the statement of policy which, if the Cabinetadopt our conclusions, it will be necessary for the Governmentto make simultaneously with the publication of the Report ofthe Royal Commission.24,     We submit to the Cabinet the following conclusions and.recommendations :-        (l) That the publication forthwith of the Report            of the-Royal Commission on Tithe Rentcharge            should now be authorised and that simultaneously-            eously with the publication of the Report            there should be presented to Parliament a            Command Paper embodying the policy of the            Government in regard to the Report and an            undertaking that the necessary legislation            to give effect to that policy will be            introduced on an early date.
205 (2) That  the Government&apos;s policy should he based    on the general acceptance of the recommend-    ations of the Majority Report of the Royal    Commission modified so as to achieve the    following objects    (i) to provide a reasonable measure of        compensation for Local Authorities;    (ii) to provide a margin, within the        financial limits of the scheme, out        of which some relief may be given for        a limited period at least to holders        of benefices;  (iii) to satisfy the condition (which should        be accepted as a cardinal principle)        that no additional net charge shall        fall upon the taxpayer as the result        of the proposed change of system. (3) That these objects can best be achieved by    the acceptance of the Treasury alternative    scheme summarised in paragraphs 12 and. 13    above as subsequently modified in detail    in the discussions with the Church and Local    Authorities. (4) That, as agreed with, the Local Authorities,    the compensation for the loss of rate income    owing to the abolition of tithe rentcharge         rateable hereditament should consist of    a diminishing s^ale of payments, the equivalen    cost of which to the Exchequer is  600,000    per annum for sixty years.  Note should be    taken of the considerations mentioned in    paragraph 16 which may at some remote date in    the future and in certain events cause the    Local Authorities to ask that special    consideration may be given to a claim on    their part for further relief.(5)  That the claims of the Church should be met    by a lump sum payment of  2 mill ions(as    explained, in paragraph 19 above) equivalent    to an annuity of  72,266 for sixty years.    In announcing this decision the Government    should express the hope that in making use    of this  money the Church will  give  special    consideration to the claims  of  existing    incumbents  in receipt  of the smaller incomes    who may be  adversely affected by the changes.(6)  That  in  order  to satisfy the condition  laid    down  in  (.2) (iii)  above  the period during which    the redemption  annuities  payable by  the tithe-    payers under  the  Commissions scheme  of    extinguishment  should be  increased from 40    years  to  60 years.
(?)   That  after taking account  of  the     compensation payments  in  (4)  and  (5)     above,  and of the very grave  contingent     risks which the Exchequer  will  assume     under the scheme, no margin will  remain     for further concessions to the  tithe-     payers  or any other interested  parties,(8)   That  approval should be given to  the draft     Command Paper (CP.49A(36)) which embodies     the policy summarised  above.(9)   That  the Committee should  be  authorised  to     prepare a draft Bill to give  effect to the     approved policy, for the consideration of     the Home Affairs Committee and  the Cabinet.

ROYAL COMMISSION ON  TITHE RENTCHARGE                          REPORT To THE KING&apos;S  MOST EXCEIJJBNT MAJESTY. MAY IT PLEASE YOUB  MAJESTY.   By Warrant issued under Your Majesty&apos;s Royal  Sign Manual on the 27th day of August, 1934, we were authorised and appointed to enquire into and report upon the whole question  of tithe rent- charge in England and Wales and its incidence, with special refer - ence to stabilised value, statutory  remission, powers of  recovery, and method and terms of redemption.  We now humbly submit to Your Majesty the following Report.                      INTRODUCTION.  1. At the outset of our  proceedings we issued through the Press a general invitation to all persons and bodies interested to communi- cate with  our  Secretary  with a  view  to arrangements for  the submission of their evidence; we also specially invited  by letter certain Public Departments to provide  us with  information  and asked other bodies concerned with the matter of our reference to place their views before us.  2. In view of  the nature of our enquiry, we deemed it  advisable to decide that  we would receive  the  oral evidence  of  interested bodies and persons in public,  and  publish  at intervals  both  the written and oral evidence  which  we had received.   We made a public announcement  to this effect.  3. Following this procedure we have held twenty public sittings for oral evidence and  have also met repeatedly for private delibera- tions.  The names of the  witnesses who gave oral evidence  before us and of the Public  Departments  or bodies which in some cases those witnesses  represented are given in Appendix I to this Beport in the order  in  which they were  heard.   In the same  Appendix particulars are  also  given for  witnesses who submitted written evidence  but  whose attendance for the purpose of giving oral  evi- dence we  did not think it necessary to invite.  We have  arranged to publish  a full record of such evidence,  together with  a certain number of the letters  received by us on the subject of our enquiry which  seemed to be  typical of views widely held or  to present special interest.  4. It is perhaps necessary that we should explain  that, with a view of avoiding  any undue delay in the presentation of our Report, we found it desirable  to lay down  as a general rule that witnesses should be required to limit their evidence to a single  statement,&apos;: supplemented in most cases by one oral examination.  This  singleIstatement was sufficient for the purposes of our enquiry, even when1  30944                                                  A i
  allegations  as to particular grievances  were the subject of conflict  between witnesses.  It was not in our opinion either necessary  or  possible for us to examine, as if  we  were a  Court of Law, the  details  of  particular cases; the  nature of our task  compelled  us  to  content  ourselves   with  drawing  conclusions  of  a  general  character.    5. On one question only did we deem it necessary to depart from  this general rule:  this was where allegations were made reflecting  on the impartiality or regularity of the conduct of officers of County  Courts  in the execution of sales by  tender of  goods seized under  distress in  proceedings for the recovery of tithe rentcharge.  These  allegations seemed to us to raise a grave matter of public concern  and we invited the-Lord Chancellors  Department to submit on this point an additional memorandum.*   6. It may also be well that we should at the outset  make it clear  that it is our opinion that our terms of  reference did not require  or authorise us to deal with questions as to the internal finance of the Church of England or of the Commissioners of Church Temporalities in Wales or of any other tithe-owning body. It is true that a con- siderable amount of evidence bearing on such points was put before us by certain witnesses, and we have  taken into consideration such evidence as  at  any  rate  illustrative  of opinions  and currents of feeling  on the questions referred to us, but the matters of public concern with which we had to  deal were  the  relations between tithe-owners and tithe-payers as such and the general effect of the existence of tithe rentcharge as part of the  social and economic structure- ture of the country.  We did not consider that we were  concerned with questions as  to the application after receipt of sums paid as tithe rentcharge.                             PAET  I.                         GENERAL SURVEY.                        Tithes  before  1836.   7. In view of the terms of our  Commission we do not think it necessary or profitable  to  discuss  the  vexed  question of the origin of  tithes or to enter into their history before and since the Re- formation  up to the  date of their  abolition under the Tithe Act of 1836.  Whether tithes had their  origin in grants by landholders or arose from a  universal  or almost universal custom of Christen- dom derived from  what was or what was supposed  to  have been the practice  of the  Hebrew nation and  based upon the Old Testa- mentt, or again whether, if allowance be  made for changes which in  the  course of more than a thousand  years have  affected the    * See Minutes of Evidence, pages 632 to 634.    t Genesis XXVIII, 22 :  &quot;of all that thou shaft give me, I will surely givethe tenth unto thee.&quot;  See also Leviticus XXVII, 32.  Tithes were also known inAncient Greece (Herodotus I. 89. cf. Xenophon  Anab., V.3. 13).
  constitution and organisation  of  society,  tithes in  their  original  form could or could not in early times have been properly designated  as a  tax,  the tithes which under  the Act of 1836  were commuted1  into tithe  rentcharge had for  many centuries before that Act  was  passed  been recognised as  a subject of ownership, and the  rights  of their proprietors, whether clerical or lay (the latter for a great  part  claiming  title as a  result of the  legislation of  Henry VIII)  had  been  protected in the  King&apos;s Courts  civil and ecclesiastical.   8.  This  recognition  and  protection  was  in  no  way  in  conflict  with  the view,  to which  effect was given in 1836,  that tithes were  a proper subject for  legislative regulation;  at  that date tithes as  then  rendered  were  generally  considered by economists such as  Adam Smith and   by instructed  opinion to be, in  the words of  Lord John .Eussell, &quot; a  discouragement to  industry, a penalty on  skill,  and  a heavy  mulct  on those who expended the most capital  and displayed the  greatest  skill in the cultivation  of the land &quot;*,  and therefore proper  to be reformed and controlled by  the Legis-  lature.   9.  As a  result of this  general dissatisfaction,  the old system of  tithes so far as it  then remained in effective existence was com-  pletely abolished in 1836.                        The  Tithe Act, 1836.   10.  Tithe rentcharge in England and Wales, the subject matter  on which in all its aspects we are commissioned to report, is  the  creation of the   Tithe  Act, 1836,  &quot;  An Act for the  Commutation  of Tithes in England and Wales &quot; (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4, cap. 71).&quot; The  object and effect of this  Act was  to substitute  for tithes payable  or leviable in kind  (including  those then being  paid by means of  a modus or composition),  au annual money payment  called &quot; tithe  rentcharge  &quot;,  which was  intended to represent  the value t  of  the  tithes then in  actual  collection.     The  Act thus  completely  re-  formed  the relationship  of  tithe-owner and tithe-payer  and  was  expected,  especially  as  it  abolished  the evil  of  the  &quot; growing  tithe &quot;,  that is  tithe  increasing in amount with improvements in  agriculture, to  furnish a permanent  cure  for the then existing  evils.  The legislation of  1836 has  been amended by no fewer than  fifteen subsequent  Acts ending with the Tithe  Act  of  1925, but    *  Hansard&apos;s Parliamentary  Debates, Vol. 31, p. 186.   t In the -words  of Section 37 of the Act, &quot; the clear average value (after making  til just deductions on account of the expenses of collecting, preparing for sale, and  marketing, &quot;where such  tithes have been taken in kind) of  the tithes of the  said  pirish, according to  the average of seven years preceding Christmas in the year 1835.&quot;   For convenience throughout the Report we have referred to the area for which  Ike tithes  were separately valued and commuted as a &quot; tithe district.&quot; This area  was usually an ecclesiastical parish but, as defined in Section 12 of the Act of  1836, townships or villages with  separate overseers of the poor were treated as  separate areas for this purpose.
 the main lines of the  system then instituted remain unchanged at  the present day.      Total  Value of Tithe  Rentcharge  and  its ownership.   11. The annual value  of tithe rentcharge (including extraordinary tithe rentchargej) in England and Wales at par*as established under the Act  of  1836  amounted to over   4,054,000t ; of  this amount approximately three-quarters was the property of corporate bodies or  individuals (the latter mainly parochial incumbents) connected with the Church of England.  The  statement submitted to us by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries  (hereinafter referred to as &quot; the  Ministry &quot;) gave  3,152,400  (par value)* as the amount of tithe rentcharge extant at  the  present date,  but it was explained to  us that so far as lay  tithe rentcharge in private hands was con- cerned the figure  was an estimate only.  We, therefore, asked the Ministry  of Health to obtain  complete returns from the local rating authorities of the gross annual  value of  tithe  rentcharge charged on  lands  in  their districts other  than rentcharge owned by Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty,  the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and the Welsh Commissioners, as to which complete and precise information was already available.  On the basis of these returns, combined  with the information supplied by the main tithe-owning bodies, the total tithe rentcharge at  present  in  existence  (December, 1934) is of the par  value of  approximately   3,100,130,  the reduction from the original  commuted amount being the  result mainly of redemp- tions and mergers and of the operation of the  Extraordinary Tithe Redemption Act  of  1886.1    Of this reduced sum   2,088,032 is the property of  Queen  Anne&apos;s  Bounty  (whose  sphere of action has been increased  by  recent legislation) I, as to  1,992,288 on behalf of parochial incumbents  and as to the balance on behalf of  ecclesiastical corporations; and  274,000 is the property of the Ecclesiastical CommissionersII.    Of the  remainder,   205,500 be- longs to the Commissioners in whom the property transferred on disendowment from the disestablished Welsh Church is now vested; and the balance  ( 532,598)  is the property  of the  Colleges and Universities  of Oxford  ( 48,100)  and Cambridge  ( 49,750),  of the Colleges of Eton and Winchester, Hospitals of ancient founda- tion, Charities and of private  lay owners (approximately  434,748).                   Estimate of Titheable Land.   12. Reliable statistics are not available  as to the total amount of land in England and Wales subject to tithe rentcharge ; it is thought    J See para. 172.    * See para. 18.    t Minutes  of Evidence, 1st Day, page 2, para.  11.    S The Tithe Act, 1925-see para. 37.    II These amounts may thus be  described in popular  language as the propertyof the Church of England.
that as a result of the legislation of 1836 about 25,000,000 acres practically  all of an  agricultural character were made so subject* ;at the present time the titheable area may be estimated,  if redemp-tion and merger have  affected acreage in the same  proportion  asthey have  affected the value of  the tithe rentcharge  redeemed,  at approximately  19,400,000 acres.   Of this amount a certain propor-tion is no longer agricultural land.  One of our witnesses estimatedthis non-agricultural proportion  at  one-sixth, t but in a statement which Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty have furnished  of the tithe  rentchargevested in them approximately one-twelfth of the total  tithe rent-charge is shown as. collected in respect of non-agricultural land.   Itis, however, probably not the case that the proportion between theareas  of agricultural and non-agricultural land is the same  as theproportion  between the amounts of tithe rentcharge charged on suchlands  respectively,  and we are inclined to think that an  estimateof one-eighth or one-ninth of the  area of titheable  land as non-agricultural is likely to prove more accurate. J           Average Value of Tithe Rentcharge per acre.  13.  On the foregoing figures the average rate of tithe  rentchargeon  all  titheable land in England and Wales taken  at   105  (thepresent figure)  per  100 of the original settlement of  1836 is about3s.  6d. an  acre or,  if taken at par value, 3s. 4d. an acre.   Thisaverage masks  very large differences. Thus, according to  the  figuressubmitted  by the Bursars  of the  Oxford Colleges, tithe  rentchargepayable by those Colleges varied from 9d. to 5s. lOJd.  per acre,gand according to figures submitted by the Bursars of the  CambridgeColleges the variation of the average charge per acre per  parish was from 3d. and 4fd. in Westmorland and Yorkshire, respectively,  to7s.  6d. and 6s. 3d. in Nottinghamshire and Hertfordshire.I!  PromEast Anglia cases were cited to the Commission in which  the  charge was as high as 12s. to 14s. per  acre.   The reason for these varia-tions in figures is discussed in a later  paragraph. 1T           Absence  of  Reliable Statistical Information.  14.  We  may here call attention to the absence of accurate statis-tical information as to  many points of importance  in  connectionwith tithe  rentcharge.  Tithe rentcharge not being a Governmentlevy is not managed or collected  by any Government Department.No central  register of tithe rentcharge showing the present day tithe-owners and landowners exists.   Even when the title  to land  is   * Minutes of Evidence, 1st Day, page 14, Question 5.   t Minutes of Evidence, 20th Day, page 559, para. 3.   j The Sixth Annual Report of the Ministry of Health, 1924-1925  (Cmd. 2450),page 89, indicates that in April, 1924, 90-3 per cent, of the total rateable value ofiithe rentcharge arose out of property situate in rural districts.

registered and a registered title to agricultural land is a very rareoccurrence the register contains no record of the existence or non-existence of a liability to tithe rentcharge.   Complete  and accurate information as to the amount and incidence of tithe rentcharge andthe value  of  the land  now  subject to  it could only be obtained by individual enquiry of  all tithe-owners and all tithe-payers a  task which it would have been manifestly impossible for us  to undertakeif our Report was to be presented in a reasonable time.  Even withthe very full  assistance given to us by  the evidence of the Ministry,Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the WelshCommissioners and the Colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, we havehad to be content with estimated rather than actual figures on some points of  importance.   While, therefore,  we have  no- doubt  thatthe evidence given to  us has presented us with a fair and reliablepicture  of the  general  condition  of the  problem,  and allows usto submit  our  recommendations  without  any general reserve,  ithas not  been  possible for us to give the exact figures which  completestatistical information  would have enabled us to produce.*    Establishment and Apportionment of  Tithe  Rentcharge.  15. Under the Tithe Act, 1836, the total amount of tithe  rent-charge as  a money payment to be charged upon the lands of a tithedistrict  as a  substitute for the tithes which were then  collectablewas  determined for every district  either  voluntarily, as a  result  of agreements made between the landowners and tithe-owners in thetithe  district,  or, failing voluntary  agreement,  compulsorily byawards of the Tithe Commissioners appointed under the Act. Wherevoluntary arrangements were  made,  the Act did not restrict thebasis on which agreement might be reached, but where  resort washad to compulsory awards the &quot; clear average value &quot; of  the com-muted tithes was calculated for the seven years preceding Christmas,1835, and formed the  basis of the new charge.   In some cases land was  transferred  to the tithe-owners in satisfaction of their claims to tithe.  16. The amount of tithe rentcharge thus  fixed by agreement  orotherwise had then to be apportioned over  the lands in  the tithedistrict; this apportionment was effected either by valuers appointedby parochial  meetings or by the Tithe  Commissioners, and  might bemade in more ways than one ; it will be enough for present purposesto state that  it might consist of the imposition either  of a single sumupon a  farm as a whole  (now usually known as a farm apportion-ment) or of separate sums upon separate  fields  (now usually knownas a field  apportionment). t  The Act of  1836 also contained a pro-vision by  which owners might arrange for a special distribution  of   * See, for example, para. 33 (Remissions under Section 8 of the Act of 1891).   t For convenience it is proposed to use throughout this Report the expression:&quot; a tithe area &quot; to describe lands charged separately with tithe rentcharge, whether as a farm or as a field.
the charge as between the several  parts of their own lands in thetithe district, but subject to the condition, inserted doubtless prin-cipally for the protection of the security of the tithe-owners, that noland was to be charged with any tithe rentcharge on account of thetithes of any  other land unless the value of the land so charged was at least  three times the value of the whole charge thereon.*                          Tithe  Maps.  17. It was a necessary part of the system instituted by the act of 1836  that  maps  should be prepared showing the lands chargedwith tithe rentcharge.   The Tithe  Commissioners were authorisedto employ  land  surveyors for the  purpose of  surveying, mappingand planning, and  a map or plan  had to accompany the draft ofevery apportionment which was  submitted to the Tithe Commis-sioners for confirmation.   These maps, which are usually referredto as Tithe Maps,  were  not prepared on any uniform scale;  themajority were made 90 to 100 years ago and have  not since been revised  or brought  up  to date except so far as legal re-apportion-ments have necessitated  such a step.  Copies of all instruments of re-apportionment with any maps attached have  been deposited inthe parish with the copies of the  Tithe  Map and Tithe Appor-tionment.   Maps have  been attached to instruments of re-appor-tionment only When a sub-division of ownership and an alterationof the boundaries of property has taken place within a tithe area.We refer  in  a subsequent paragraph! to  these maps  but what isstated in this paragraph may be allowed to reinforce what we havealready  said! as  to the lack of complete statistical information.                Par Value of Tithe Rentcharge.  18. The annual amount of the tithe rentcharge established underthe Act  of 1836  was expressed in the award or agreement in termsof bushels of  wheat, barley and oats on the average prices of thosecrops for  the seven years ending  at  Christmas,  1835, the pricesper bushel being  7s.  OJd.  for wheat, 3s. lljd. for  barley, and2s. 9d.  for oats, and each crop being treated as contributing one-third part of  the annual charge.   Thus an annual charge of  100would be  represented  by 94-95549 bushels of wheat, 168-42105bushels  of barley, and  242-42424 bushels of oats,  those being the quantities  which at the  respective prices of  7s. OJd.,  3s.  llJcLand 2s.  9d. would be purchased by the expenditure of   33 6s. 8d.for each crop. This original amount of the annual charge is usuallyreferred to as the &quot; par value.&quot;   * Tithe Act, 1836, Section 58.  This provision suggests that  normally thevalue of tithe rentcharge was not expected to amount to one-third of the value ofthe land.   -f- See para. 148.   I See para. 14.
                        Variations in Value.   19. This  annual charge  was  variable; it  did not remain fixed at its par value but, as provided by  the Act of 1836,  fluctuated every year  according to the average prices  during the  preceding seven years of the quantities of corn used for the calculation of the par value.  These average  prices were determined officially under statutory  arrangements of which it is not necessary now to record the details.*  The average prices  (expressed in percentages of the average for the  seven years ending 1835 which  is taken as 100) which governed  tithe rentcharge for each year from 1837 to 1918 (when,  as explained later in this Report,  a new provision was enacted) are given in Appendix II to this Report.  It will be seen that for 50 years out of the 82  from 1837-1918 the average prices were below 100 or &quot; par &quot;  value.   20. The primary object of the  legislature in adopting this method of settling for each year the value of tithe rentcharge would appear to have  been to secure to the tithe-owners a payment stable in pur- chasing power, t    It should, however,  be observed that  a  value fixed on the principles adopted in 1836  has a relation to the results of agricultural operations in so far as they consist of corn produc- tion, the  amount payable varying directly with the rise and fall of the prices of  corn.     Tithe Rentcharge payable by  Landowner not by  Tenant.   21.  It appears to have been the intention!  of the Act of  1836,that tithe rentcharge should be paid  by the owner as distinct from the  occupier of   the  land  affected, but the  Act did not prohibit. the  inclusion  in a  tenancy  agreement  of an  obligation  on the tenant to pay tithe  rentcharge, and  the general practice,  after 1836, seems to  have  been  for the tenant to assume this burden where agricultural land was let  on a  tenancy agreement, as was usual in  England and Wales as indeed  it was the tenant  who had been  accustomed to render tithes in kind under the conditions prevailing before 1836.   22.  In 1891 the Tithe Act of that year made an important change in this  respect  and  prohibited for the future any contract  by a tenant to pay tithe  rentcharge.   This  change had the  effect  of substituting for the tenant as the payer of tithe rentcharge a person normally -  in  a stronger economic position and  not infrequently, especially in districts,  such as great parts of  Wales,  where  non- conformity was  widespread, more  sympathetic to  the claims of, at any rate,  the ecclesiastical  tithe-owners.    * The detailed  arrangements were  described in the evidence of the Ministry  see Minutes of Evidence, 1st Day, page  3, para. 16.    t Minutes of Evidence, 1st Day, page 15, Question 10.    t See Section 80 of the Tithe Act,  1836, and Leach on the Tithe Acts (Sixth Edition), page 31.
  23. The new provision of  1891 also,  to  some  extent,  affected the practical result to the tithe-payer of the rule varying the figureof tithe rentcharge with  the seven years average of corn  prices.The benefit of an advance of corn prices, accruing  as would be thecase directly to the tenant and  not to the landlord,  could  only betranslated slowly  if at all into an  increase of rent, and the tithe-paying landowner would thus in many cases have to bear  an increaseof burden without benefiting by a corresponding increase in income.                Peculiarities of  Tithe Rentcharge.  24. The rentcharge thus established was in 1836, and still is, ofa peculiar character.  Tithe rentcharge, although it is a right to thereceipt of money and not  a right to land except in  so far as it maybe necessary to resort to land to obtain  payment of the money, isin the eye of the  law &quot; land,&quot;  a hereditament descending  (beforerecent modifications  of the  law of inheritance) - to the  heir-at-lawand not to the personal representative.  Tithe rentcharge, even whenit is owned by the same person as the owner of the land affected,does not merge in the land,  as, speaking generally, a mortgage or charge  in such a case would normally merge; unless special steps for effecting a merger are  taken, tithe rentcharge continues to existas a separate hereditament owned  by  the same  owner as the landaffected; after a sale  of the  land by a landowner  who  is also theowner of the tithe rentcharge he may enforce the charge  against his own purchaser.   Tithe rentcharge, again, is the only propertyother than land (in the usual sense*) and buildings, which is liableto local rates a quality which it has inherited from the tithes forwhich it  has been substituted.   No other rentcharge,  such as arentcharge created to secure a jointure  or money lent, is  thus liable.                     Remedies for Recovery.  25. Tithe rentcharge is singular not only in its nature as  a formof property  but  also in  the remedies by which  the  owner  canenforce his rights;  these remedies may  be  summarised, without going into detail,t as follows :   26. Under the  Tithe Act, 1836, the  principal  remedy  of  theowner of tithe rentcharge (whom it will  be  convenient  to refer toas the tithe-owner) was by distress, levied like a landlords  distressby the  tithe-owner&apos;s  own action and on his own responsibility.The  Tithe Act, 1891, which, as already stated, made  tithe rent-charge in spite of any agreement to the  contrary an obligation ofthe owner of the land and not of the tenant, modified the older lawin this respect.  As things now  stand, if  the  landowner  is  himself   * A tenancy of sporting rights is also rateable.  But such a tenancy gives adirect right of access to, and a certain use of, land.   f For a full account of the present position  we may refer to  the  evidence submitted by  the Lord Chancellors Department (Minutes of  Evidence, pages620 to 632).
 in occupation,  the tithe-owner can no longer distrain  on his own initiative but can apply to the County Court for. the appointment of an officer of the Court to distrain.   The distraint is limited to the recovery of not more than two  years&apos;  arrears of the charge.* But if the  land is let to a tenant at an adequate rent,  the remedy of the tithe-owner is not  distress but to obtain the appointment by the County Court of a receiver of the rent payable by the tenant.   27.  Where the remedy of distress is  resorted to and proves to be insufficient, the tithe-owner can, by taking proceedings in the High Court, obtain possession of the land.  This is, however, an unsatis- factory  remedy,  and,  according to  the  evidence which  we have heard, is  only  rarely  resorted to.  The  tithe-owner who  takes possession  would, according to one generally accepted authority,! be very  much in the position of a mortgagee in possession and liable to account  accordingly; and though he may retain possession until he receives payment of the arrears he  cannot let the land for any period exceeding one year.J   28.  Distress,  the  appointment of  a  receiver and the taking of possession  (subject to the qualifications noted above) are  thus  the only remedies available  for the tithe-owner; the position is remark- able not only in the remedies given but also in those that are with- held.  Tithe rentcharge, differing in this  from tithes  under the  old law as it stood  before  1836, cannot be recovered in an  action at law as a debt owing by  the owner of the land  personally to  the owner of the charge, even though the Tithe Act, 1891, declares that tithe rentcharge &quot; shall  be payable by the owner of the lands.&quot; And, although tithe rentcharge  is a charge which is  paramount to any mortgage or other charge  created by a landowner, it is not enforce- able by  the remedies of foreclosure or sale usually available to a mortgagee or other creditor who has tho land for his security, nor by the remedies which  the practice of conveyancers  or legislative enactment has conferred upon the owner of an ordinary  rentcharge. Equally, although tithe rentcharge resembles an incumbrance, it differs in many  ways from ordinary incumbrances and  is  not as a matter of law included  in the  term &quot; incumbrance.&quot;  As already observed,if the land  is  registered under the Land registration Acts, particulars of tithe rentcharge are not disclosed on the register. A vendor&apos;s  covenant to  a  purchaser against incumbrances  does not cover tithe rentcharge.  The owner  of the land affected is not under any legal obligation  to disclose of his own  motion the existence or amount of tithe rentcharge as affecting his title to the land, though    * Following on the Act of 1836, which enacted that not more than  two years&apos;arrears  of tithe rentcharge should be recoverable at any time by  distress, the  act of  1891  provided that a sum on account of tithe rentcharge shall not be recoverableunless proceedings have been commenced before the  expiration of two years fromthe date at which it became payable.    t Leach on the Tithe Acts  (Sixth Edition), page lviii.    % Tithe Act, 1842, Section 12.    5 See para. 14.
he may be bound to give what information is in his possession when asked to do so, as is the usual practice, by a purchaser, and althoughupon  the  sale of agricultural land by auction it  is usual to include a statement  as  to tithe  rentcharge in  any printed particulars  of sale. :  29.  It should, however, be emphasised that these remedies of thetithe-owner  seem  not to  have been given by Parliament with any intention  of leaving his rights without adequate defence or throwingdoubt upon  his  title  to tithe rentcharge as property.  It was  con-sidered in 1836 that the remedy by distress was effective  and appro-priate.  But the nature of the remedy given is sufficient  to indicatethat tithe rentcharge while not permitted to be a personal obligationwas not deemed to need for its protection a right capable of alteringdirectly the property in the land.   It was not contemplated that thetithe-owner  should  by the  exercise  of his remedies  become theowner, or entitled to dispose  of the ownership, of  the fee simple.*             Tithe Rentcharge and the Value of Land.  30.  The amount of. the tithe rentcharge determined under the act of 1836, while it was based on the value of the tithes in kind receiv-able at that date by the tithe-owner,  did not vary with any changein the value of the land  affected  or its  produce or in the characterof its cultivation but, as  already explained, solely with corn prices.If the value of the land were to fall and thus the value of the titherentcharge to increase relatively to the value of the land, the legisla-tion of  1836 prescribed  no  alteration in the  amount  of the  titherentcharge,  not even  if the  rentcharge should equal or  exceed theannual value of the land.  Since the figure for tithe rentcharge was based on  the value of titheable produce, which in 1836  for a  large part consisted of corn, during the  years immediately preceding thatdate,  the  heaviest charges were  as a rule those imposed on  whatwas then profitable corn-growing land, as for example in East Angliaand East  Kent.   This land  has now  for the most part declined  in value as  corn growing in this country has  become less profitableand the tithe rentcharge  on this formerly corn-growing land is thusmuch higher  in  relation to the  value of  the  land  than it  wasin 1836.  Changes of this kind have not affected  all  parts of thecountry with equal severity;  for the most part districts where littlecorn was grown, as for example in Wales and the North of England,were  lightly tithed in 1836,  and therefore remain lightly burdenednow.   * It is possible that one reason for this limitation of the remedies of the tithe-owner is to be found in the fact that at common law, in the absence of special custom,tithes were not due of &quot; anything that was of the substance of the earth or partof the freehold, as mines and quarries . .  .&quot; (Eagle on Tithes, Vol. 1, page 423)and it would, therefore, have been inappropriate in 1836 to give to the owner of the rentcharge a right to a sale or foreclosure of the fee simple of the land affected ,(of. also Section 90 of the Tithe Act, 1836.)
   31. Proposals made during the discussion preceding the passing of the Tithe Act of 1836 for establishing a proportion between rent (the usual indicator of the annual value of land) and tithe or tithe rentcharge were rejected by the leaders of the  two chief parties in the House of Commons, Lord John Eussell and Sir Robert Peel,* and it was not thought that  the  contingency of an eventual fall in corn prices as a result of a possible repeal of the Corn Laws need be met by any special legislative provision, t  But it may be conjectured that in spite of the silence on this point of the Act of 1836 and the eleven subsequent enactments which  followed  from 1837  to  1886, there remained in the  minds of many of those concerned a sentiment that a charge which had its origin in the rendering of the tenth part of certain products of  land was not intended, and could not reason- ably be allowed, to absorb more  than some  fraction of the annual value of the land.   Indeed, it is evident as  a matter of economics that the only fund out of which  tithe rentcharge is payable is  the same as that out of which  agricultural rent is payable viz.,  the surplus remaining after the proper expenses of cultivation, including a reasonable allowance to the farmer for living expenses, have been met. I  This is not to say that a landowner may not meet tithe rent- charge out of resources  not connected with the land nor even  that the  rent received in past years may not be drawn upon, if still in the landowners pocket, for current tithe rentchaige.  But  in  the long run, as is indicated by  the frame of the Act of 1836, and  particularly by the character of the remedies which that  Act gives  and refuses, the  land is regarded as the  source  of tithe rentcharge; and &apos;&apos;  the land &quot; in this connection can only mean the surplus value remain- ing  after current expenses of cultivation have been met.   Tithe rent- charge itself is not  a  current expense of cultivation, but a money payment not corresponding to any direct current receipt of benefit. The expense of the  cultivation of a given piece  of land  is the same whether it is or is not subject to tithe rentcharge.                   Effect of Legislation of 1891.   32.  In 1891, in view of manifestations of  widespread discontent with the  payment of  tithe  rentcharge under  the then  existing conditions, the Legislature by the Tithe Act of that year recognised the  justice or perhaps the necessity  of  bringing the  amount of tithe rentcharge into direct connection with rental value.  Section 8 of the Tithe  Act,  1891, compelled a  County  Court,   if  satisfied on the occasion of an  application  of a tithe-owner for an order  for recovery  of  tithe  rentcharge  that  the tithe  rentcharge exceeded   * Hansard,  Parliamentary Debates,  1836, XXXI, page 200.  It is obvious that any proposal to make  the rights of individual tithe-owners depend upon the rent actually charged by the landlord to the tenant of the land affected would be open  to serious objection.  The tithe-owner has no say in fixing the  rent.   f Ibid XXXII, pages 597-9.   J This is also true, but perhaps less obvious, in the case of tithes payable in kind.
two-thirds  of  the  annual value of the land  affected as determinedby the  assessment  made under  Schedule B  to  the Income  TaxAct,  to order the remission  of  the excess.  The  provision  thusintroduced openly into tithe legislation aroused no  little oppositionas it was  argued that it was  in direct  conflict  with the  guidingprinciples of the Act of 1836*, but this provision is firmly established as a part  of  the  existing system and  appears to  us to be a notillogical deduction from  the fact that tithe  rentcharge was a  sub-stitute for a right to  a tenth  part of certain  produce of the land.  33. It is unfortunately not possible  to give accurate figures asto the  pecuniary effect  of  Section  8  of the Act of 1891.    Nostatistics are available showing the annual values computed accord-ing to Schedule B of the lands subject to  tithe rentcharge.   Accord-ing to the  evidence given to us on behalf of Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty t,the remissions made by  the County  Courts  on benefice  tithe  rent-charge  payable to the Bounty  amounted in  1934 to only  3,525out  of  a  total  collectable value  of over two million pounds, butit is clear that the existence  of the statutory  provision has hadthe effect of inducing the tithe-owner to modify  his claim in caseswhere it is probable that an application to the County Court wouldresult in  remission.                       From 1891 to 1914.  34. After the important legislation  of 1891 the tithe questionmay  be said  to  have  been  dormant  until  fresh  action  became necessary  as  a result of the  Great  War.    The annual  value of the rentcharge  during  the period  1891 to 1914 was low : at thebeginning of this period (1891) it was  a  little  over  76, at theend  (1914) it nearly reached  the same figure, but  in the  intervalit was  for several years under  70.  The  burden thus  was  com-paratively light and after  1891  it was  borne by what  were  thenbroader shoulders.                         The  Great  War.   35. The Great War revolutionised the  situation.&apos; The rise incorn prices resulting from the War  had brought the annual valueof tithe rentcharge up to  109 3s. lid. in 1918 and it was apparentin that year  that unless the legislature intervened  the value  for1919, calculated on the average prices of  the preceding seven years, by then including three  or four years of  war prices, would be very nearly  124 with a prospect of further steep increases in the follow- ing  years!.   Such rates  would have  provoked great discontent andwould hardly have been recognised as an equitable burden.  Where    * Reference may be made in particular to the article by Earl Grey (son of EarlGrey of the Reform Bill) in &quot; The Nineteenth Century,&quot; No. 155, January, 1890.   t Minutes of Evidence, 14th Day, page 386, para. 19.    t In Appendix II to this Report will be found the annual values at which titherentcharge  would  have stood from 1919 to 1935 if  no amending legislation hadbeen  passed.  In 1922 the figure would have exceeded  172 per  100 (par value).On the other hand, if there had been no such legislation the value of tithe rentchargefor 1935 would have been  80 16s. lid. only.
the tithe-payer was a landowner with a tenant holding under him,his power  to raise  rents  so  as  to obtain the full  benefit of warprices  was  to  some extent  restricted by legislation and in any event the process of raising  the rent against a sitting tenant canonly be  carried through after  considerable  difficulty and delay often with  reluctance -and  with  the risk of losing the tenant;where  the  landowner was himself the occupier he had  in manycases (particularly in and soon after  1919 and  1920) bought theland at an inflated price and  could with difficulty meet an increasein  his  tithe rentcharge,  especially when,  as must  be  the  casewhen the rate  is calculated on an  average of the past seven years,the largest  demand comes not  when the  prices are at the highestpoint but after they have begun,  perhaps rapidly,  to decline.  Intruth; the purchase of land at exaggerated prices by men of limitedcapital  resources has  greatly complicated the situation by intro-ducing  a large  number  of new  tithe-payers  who  are often not ina position to meet any  increase of expenses.                      The Tithe Act, 1918.  36. One  first effect of the  Great War  in  relation to  tithe rent-charge was the Tithe Act of 1918.    In  this Act the Legislaturefound  it necessary  to depart, at  any rate temporarily, from theprinciple of  a  varying annual value; the value of  the  charge forthe years from 1919 to 1925&apos; was stabilised at  the figure reached in  1918, namely   109  3s. lid., with a  provision, however,  thatafter 1925  a return should be  made to  the principle of  variationbut on an  average of corn prices for fifteen years instead of seven.On this principle  the result of the  high war prices would havebeen spread over a longer period, but during  the later  years ofthat period  the annual values  for tithe rentcharge would have largely  exceeded  those  which would have resulted if  no changehad been made*.  The  Tithe Act, 1925, Stabilisation of  Annual  Value at 105.  37. This  did not exhaust the results of the War.  As  the  year1925 approached it was seen to be  necessary to amend the legis-lation of 1918, and the Tithe Act,  1925, was enacted.    This Actdid three things of the  greatest importance :        (a)  First, it revised the  principle  of the Act  of 1836 and     stabilised  all tithe  rentcharge for all future years  after 1926     at  a fixed figure  105 for   100 tithe rentcharge (par value).     This figure was calculated  as  an estimate for succeeding years     of the course of those corn prices which hitherto had  governed     the variations of the annual value of  tithe rentcharge.  For the     future the figure was fixed  and the relationship of  tithe rent-     charge with  the  actual  variations of corn prices was aban-     abandoned.   The figure of  105 was reached upon expert  advice     after the failure of  negotiations between bodies representative           * The figures are given in Appendix  II to this Report.
   of the tithe-payers on the one hand and the tithe-owners on   the other.   It was  not  an  agreed figure.  One of the most   important questions which we have to  consider is how far  this   figure has  proved itself  to be a just basis for the settlement   of the claims  of the tithe-owner.     (b) Second,  the Act  vested in Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty  all   tithe rentcharge attached to benefices  (the amount par value    now remaining  in collection being about  1,992,288) and all   tithe  rentcharge  belonging to  ecclesiastical  corporations  (the   amount in this case now being   95,744).   The Bounty  was   thenceforward to undertake the  duty of  collecting  all  the   rentcharges so vested, with a temporary exception in  the case   of benefice tithe  rentcharge of  which the  incumbents con-   cerned  were at the date of  the Act acting  as their own  col-   lectors  and wished  to continue to do  so.    The old  personal   relationship between the incumbent entitled to the rentcharge   and the parishioner liable to  its payment  was,  for  good or   evil, abolished.*      (c) Third, the  Act sought  to  remedy  one main defect of   previous legislation the absence of a  general scheme for the   redemption of tithe rentcharge;  it provided  that an addi-   tional   4  10s. per  annum  per   100 tithe rentcharge  (par   value) should  be  paid in respect of all tithe  rentcharge vested   in Queen Anne&apos;s  Bounty  so as to  provide a sinking fund for   its extinction an event calculated to take place for  benefice   rentcharge after  85 years from the coming into force of the   Act  and for  ecclesiastical corporations&apos;  rentcharge after  81 J   years, t   This  redemption provision is,  however, confined  to   ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge vested in Queen Anne&apos;s  Bounty.   It does not extend to any other tithe rentcharge and thus  does   not provide a general and universal scheme for the  ultimate   extinction  of  the whole  of  tithe rentcharge.   We  believe,   however, that we are not mistaken in seeing in this provision   a recognition  of the desirability of the  extinction of tithe rent-   charge  upon equitable terms and an encouragement to submit   proposals leading  to that end.  Indeed, if we look back on the   past in the light  of the  knowledge of  subsequent  events,  it is   easy, though  perhaps not just to the  reputation of the legis-   lators of 1836, to reach  the conclusion that the great defect of   their work was the failure to provide  machinery for the auto-   matic extinction  of tithe rentcharge by a sinking fund or other-   wise.   But in 1836  it was  perhaps difficult to realise that a   system which at the  time  marked  a  great  advance,  was   destined in its turn to become unsuited to contemporary  con-   ditions.   *  See para. 59 (4).   t  This slight difference is a recognition of the fact that the contribution to local rates payable by Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty is smaller for incumbents&apos; tithe rentohargethan for ecclesiastical  corporations  (see para. 98).
             Increase of Wages and Cost of Repairs.  38. Another highly important change in agricultural economicsresulted from, or at any rate followed after, the War.   The wages of the ordinary  agricultural labourer, which  since  1917 have  inEngland  and Wales  been  subject to  statutory  regulation, have risen from an average of about 18s. per week in 1914 to an averageof about  31s. 6d.  at  the  present  day.   Although it may  be truethat the increase under this head  may not directly affect the cashexpenses  of  what  may  be called  the &quot; family farm,&quot; where thework is done by  the occupier and  his family, we  are satisfied thatin the case  of an  ordinary agricultural holding  the outgoings  inthe form  of  wages represent a very considerable increase  in the share taken  by labour in  the net  produce of the land, even after making allowance for any  increased output due to greater efficiencyaccompanying the  payment of  higher wages.  39. Further, the costs of repairs to buildings and other necessaryexpenses  of  an agricultural estate have  increased since the War,according to evidence which we are prepared  to  accept, by some-thing like 75 per cent.*  40. The result has been  to  diminish  the  fund  remaining afterthe payment of  normal costs  of  production  and, therefore, the capacity of the land to support  the payment of tithe rentcharge.                   Disestablishment in \Wales.  41. A complete  change in the ownership of ecclesiastical titherentcharge in Wales was  effected  under the Welsh Church Acts,1914 and  1919.   The whole  of Welsh  ecclesiastical  tithe rent-charge  was  transferred from its former  owners  to the Commis-sioners  of Church  Temporalities in Wales,  a body which as an organisation  has  no  connection with the  disestablished Church. IAs to tithe rentcharge resulting from endowments earlier  in  datethan 1662, this transfer was the  direct and immediate result  ofthe new  legislation;  as  to a  small  amount  of  tithe  rentchargeresulting from later endowments and remaining, so far as the new legislation extended,  ecclesiastical  property,   the  transfer  was effected by purchase from the disestablished Church by the Com-missioners.   Thus  all tithe rentcharge in Wales is now  in layhands; so much of it as was formerly the property of ecclesiasticaltithe-owners  has become Welsh national property subject to certaintemporary arrangements as to its application.   But  the position  ofthe Welsh Commissioners  in relation to local rates is not the sameas that  of ecclesiastical tithe-owners in  England,! nor do the pro-visions  for redemption by the  additional  payment of   4 10s. per 100 tithe rentcharge (par value) apply to any tithe rentcharge  in* See Minutes of Evidence, 8th Day, page 182, Question 2407.t Minutes of Evidence, 16th Day, page 468, Question 5607.j But see para. 99.

Tithe  Rentcharge and Rates.  42. We have already referred  to  the fact that tithe rentchargealone among payments  charged  upon land is  by law a rateablehereditament;  this is a consequence of the position of tithe rent-charge as successor to tithes, which  by long usage in England andWales had been rated under the Elizabethan Poor Law,  thoughpossibly the basis of assessment may not have been the same in  alllocalities, t  It is not necessary for  us  to discuss  the limits and natureof this liability of tithes,  the obligation having long been recognised and  affirmed by  the  Courts.I   The  Tithe Act,  1836, accepted theliability, and provided for the establishment of the amount payable by way of tithe rentcharge upon the  basis that the tithe-owner wasto be rated upon the new form assumed by his property in so faras in the older form of tithes the same property had been subject tolocal rates.   Under that Act, where  the amount  of tithe rentchargewas fixed by the voluntary procedure  of a bargain between the tithe-owners and the landowners, the bargain was based on both sides  onthe knowledge  that rates would have to be  paid  by the tithe-owneron the  amount of such  rentcharge.    When tithe  rentcharge was fixed by a compulsory award of the Tithe Commissioners, the settle-ment was on the same  basis, g    Landowners  indeed, it may  be observed, were interested in this question not  only as tithe-payers ;had tithe rentcharge not  been separately rateable the rates on their
 land would have been increased.  Where they were owner-occupiers, landowners were  directly concerned as rate-payers  in  the  parish; where  the land was let to tenants,  landowners  were indirectly affected in so far  as the  burden of rates on the occupier tended to affect the rent which could be obtained  for the land.   43. The position thus established, however,  involves some serious anomalies.  Tithe  rentcharge supplies the only case, so far as we know,  in which local rates  are  levied in respect of a money pay- ment charged upon land,  or indeed upon the receipt of money in any form.   The principle upon which  rateable  property is  assessed, namely, the ascertainment  of the amount at  which the house or land, the &quot; hereditament &quot;,  would let from year to year to a tenant is not readily  applicable  to  tithe rentcharge,  which, it is not too much to say,  is never let on commercial  terms, and never in  fact looked  upon as lettable from  year to year to  a tenant paying an economic rent.*   44. If tithe rentcharge is  to be regarded, in accordance with the accepted theory, as a separate rateable hereditament, it is not easy to see upon what principle it enters into the assessment of another distinct hereditament, the titheable land, as in fact it does under the existing law.  The practical  assumption seems, however, to be that the two rates are levied each upon one component part of the tithe- able land and that on that basis more cannot be got out of the tithe- able land  as a whole than  the  appropriate poundage of its total rateable value  as  a corporeal  hereditament.   The  amount of  the tithe rentcharge is, therefore, deducted from the full annual value of the  land before fixing the &quot; gross value &quot; of  the land for rating purposes.  But if  the two hereditaments are distinct, each should in theory  be  rated separately without regard to  the  other,  the occupier of the land paying on  the fair annual value of  what he occupies the  corporeal property and the tithe-owner  paying on the  value of his own distinct  possession.  45. If,  on the other  hand, the two hereditaments, the  lands subject  to tithe rentcharge and the tithe rentcharge itself,  are  not separate and  distinct but there is  only  one rateable corporeal hereditament,  it might have been expected that the de-rating of the land of which the tithe rentcharge is thus  ex hypothesi a part, would have involved also the de-rating  of tithe rentcharge.  46. In any  case,  as tithe  rentcharge is  a  burden  on the land-owner and  not on the tenant, it appears  anomalous to rate a tenantdifferently  according as the land he occupies is or is not free fromtithe rentcharge.  The value to him of the land for which he paysrent is in either case the  same.  What the landlord does with  the rent, whether  he pays tithe rentcharge out of  it or  not, is not  thetenant&apos;s affair.* See Minutes of Evidence, 1st Day, page 29, Question 176.
    47. Now that  agricultural land is free from rates, this anomaly   is not of so much practical importance as formerly, but where the   land  subject to tithe rentcharge is not agricultural and has  not   been  freed from rates, the anomaly persists.    48. We  call attention to these facts as justifying us in regarding   the disappearance of a rateable hereditament which must result from   the abolition of tithe rentcharge  (a result  which will be produced   in due time as to ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge by the existing law)   as a  matter of congratulation rather than of regret; we may add   that  a  public  advantage would result from  the disappearance  of   oases such as that to which a  correspondent drew  our  attention,   where the  rating authority seeks to enforce, even by imprisonment,   the liability to rates of an owner of tithe rentcharge  who has been   unable to recover the amount due to him from the tithe-payer.    49. We  discuss  more  fully in later  paragraphst  the practical   question to which the liability  of tithe rentcharge  to local rates   gives  rise in connection with any scheme for the  extinguishment   of tithe rentcharge,  and in  particular the complications resulting   from  the fact  that the  different classes of tithe-owners  are, as a   result of recent  legislation, in  different  situations in  relation  to   local rates.                            Redemption.    50. It has  only  been  gradually  and with slow and  somewhat   hesitating  steps that  Parliament has encouraged the redemption of   tithe  rentcharge.   The first statutory provision for redemption was   contained in the Act  of 1846,  which enabled a landowner, with the   consent of  the tithe-owner, to redeem any separate rentcharge not   exceeding  20s. in amount, by payment of not less than 24 times   the par value  of the rentcharge. The Act of  1860 provided for the   compulsory I redemption of tithe rentcharge of any amount charged   on lands which had become  divided for building  or other purposes   into numerous plots on the application of  an owner of any part of   the land,  the  consideration money  being fixed at  25  times the   amount of  the par value of the rentcharge. The Tithe Act of 1878   extended this provision  to include compulsory redemption on the   application of either the owner  of part of the land  or of  the tithe-   owner,  on  similar  terms to  those prescribed in  the Act of 1860.   The Act of 1878 also provided for redemption upon the joint applica-Ition of  landowner and  tithe-owner of a rentcharge exceeding  20s.   and for compulsory redemption as  against the landowner  on the   application of the tithe-owner of any rentcharge not exceeding 20s.,   whether the  lands  charged with such  rentcharge were  divided  in   ownership  or  not.  This  Act  also provided that where  lands were   taken for certain  public purposes, such as  the building of a church     * See Appendix EC to Minutes of Evidence, page 658.  Letter No. 15.     t See paras. 62 to 65 and 96 to 101.                                 ,     % i.e., compulsory as  against the other owners of  the land affected and also   against the tithe-owner.
or the making of a cemetery, the erection of  a  school, town hall,gaol, lunatic asylum, etc., the formation of sewage farms or gas orwaterworks,  the person  or  body carrying out  the  works  shouldredeem the tithe rentcharge as soon as they were in possession ofthe land.  In these cases also the consideration  money was to be25 years&apos; purchase of the par value of the rentcharge.  Little advan-tage was taken  of these provisions which  continued  in  force until1918, the  amount  of tithe  rentcharge redeemed up  to  the  endof that year amounting to some  73,000 only.  51. The Tithe Act,  1918, greatly  extended the  provisions  forredemption on  the  application of  the landowner.   It  authorisedredemptions  without the consent of the tithe-owner, and providedthat the consideration money should be such an amount as mightbe agreed  between the parties, or in default of agreement,  a sumsufficient to  produce,  when  invested in Government securities, apermanent annuity  equal to  the assumed  net income  which thetithe-owner was deriving from his rentcharge after deducting fromits gross annual value (i) the amount of the rates  paid by himthereon, (ii)  land tax (if  any) and  (iii) his cost  of collection thelast item not to exceed    per cent, of the gross annual value.  (the reduced  amount resulting may be  called the net annual value.)The Act also provided (a) that in respect of applications for redemp-tion made  on or before the 1st January, 1921,  the par value of thetithe rentcharge was  to be  regarded as  the  gross  annual  value,(b) that  the  compensation for redemption should be 21 times thenet annual value, and (c) that the redemption money could  at the option of the landowner be discharged by an annuity payable eitheryearly or half-yearly for a period not exceeding  50 years.*  52. The  result of  these provisions, which were, obviously, morefavourable  to the tithe-payer than earlier enactments, was a large increase  in the amount of tithe rentcharge redeemed. On accountof the large number  of  applications received within  the specialperiod laid  down in the Act of 1918, that is, from the 21st November,1918, until the  1st January,  1921,  many redemptions could notbe completed until 1924; during the six  years from 1919 to 1924(inclusive)  some  363,160 tithe rentcharge was  redeemed, or nearlyfive  times  the  amount of tithe rentcharge redeemed  during theperiod 1847 to 1918.  53. The  Act  of  1925 tightened  up the  procedure with regardto the redemption of tithe rentcharge on land  taken  for the public purposes specified in the  Act of 1878, and also  provided that theprovisions  of the Act  of 1878 with  regard to  redemption of titherentcharge  on lands which had been divided into numerous plotsfor building  or  other  purposes should extend  to cases  where theMinister was satisfied that the land was  about  to be  so divided.Further, inasmuch as the Act  of 1925 fixed the annual value of* See para. 165.
tithe rentcharge at the  stabilised  figure of  105 per   100 titherentcharge  (par value), this  figure became the gross  annual valueof tithe rentcharge for the purpose of redemption.  54.  Another change made by  the Act  of 1925* in  connectionwith redemption was that in calculating the consideration  money for redemption  of  lay  tithe rentcharge,  where the application forredemption is made by the owner of agricultural land, the deduction from the gross annual value on  account  of rates should not  bethe  average amount paid  by the  lay  tithe-owner over  the pre-ceding  three  years but should be fixed at a  figure  representingtwo-thirds of such  average amount.  The effect of this provision,it may be  remarked, is that the  lay tithe-owner in such  a case may  receive on  redemption  a  capital sum  which, if invested  inGovernment securities, will  produce  a higher net  income than he was receiving from his tithe rentcharge.   We have not receivedany evidence explanatory of the object aimed at by this provision,and it  is of interest to note that  the  scheme of redemption putforward to us by  the Bursars on behalf  of  the University and colleges of Cambridge  provided  that the  lay  tithe-owner  shouldforego his existing  rights in this particular class of  caset.  55.  The  evidence which  we  have  received  indicates  that  for various reasons the intentions of  Parliament with regard  to re-redemption of tithe  rentcharge have not been fulfilled.   The pro-visions of the Act of 1878, passed  over 50 years ago, clearly aimed at the extinguishment  by redemption of  all  tithe r/entchargesof  a small  amount not exceeding  20s.  in  the absence of  specialcircumstances,  and  also  of  all  tithe  rentcharge, whatever theamount, charged on land divided  for building or other purposes.But we understand  (i)  that the  Ministry  in  the exercise  of  itsdiscretion has not,  as a general rule, felt  justified in recent years in ordering the  redemption of individual tithe rentcharges charged on undivided lands exceeding 10s.  payable  by a particular propertyowner, and  (ii)  that any application for  redemption  on dividedlands  has  been left to the initiative of the tithe-owner, and thetithe-owner in the  past has in numerous cases not availed himselfof the  provisions of the Acts, probably because of his power  to recover the whole  tithe rentcharge from any part of  the lands  onwhich it is  charged.  56. It is  obvious that  the  redemption of tithe  rentcharge afterland has been divided into a number of small ownerships  results in  much  trouble and expense  for identifying  and measuring  upthe individual properties and recovering shares of redemption  money and expenses from each  property owner.   But  although Parlia-ment has sought to meet this  difficulty  by  making the provision,to  which we have already referred, for allowing redemption  to          * See Section 17 (2).         t Minutes of Evidence, 18th Day, page 559, para. 17.
proceed on  the application of the  tithe-owner  before  sub-divisionof the  land,  the initiative  here still rests with  the  tithe-ownerand  he is often  in  ignorance of the landowners intentions as to development..  And  indeed another reason why full  effect has notbeen given  to this  provision is  that  land about to be  divided for building is  often vacant  land,  uncultivated  and unlet,  and con-sequently recovery  of  the  redemption  money and expenses is rendered  difficult since  distress is  the only  method available forthis  purpose under the present law.   57. Had Parliament at  a much earlier date enacted effective pro-visions  for  the compulsory redemption of tithe rentcharge-  on  allland immediately on  it  ceasing to  be agricultural land and  being developed for industrial  or other purposes, we should not now haveto deal with amounts of tithe rentcharge which are comparatively small in relation to individual property owners but mount up to aconsiderable sum over the whole country, and now remain charged on lands  covered with factories, houses or other buildings.   In alater part*  of  this Report we make recommendations  with  regardto these areas.               Difficulties of the Present Position.   58. The evidence  to which we have listened has convinced us thatthe  present position with regard to  tithe rentcharge cannot be con-sidered to be satisfactory.  The difficulties which exist  are in parteconomic and  in part social  in  character; if we are asked to dis-distinguish between the  economic and social elements we are inclined to attach  greater importance to the latter.  If tithe rentcharge werenothing but a mere  money payment in recognition  of value directlyreceived by the landowner or his immediate predecessor in title, thepresent position would not have arisen and what in the  majority ofcases is not a heavy monetary burden would have been borne if not always  without difficulty at any rate without any great amount of friction.  Present difficulties are in  our opinion greatly increased bythe  views entertained whether justly or not as  to the  origin of the rentcharge, views coloured largely  by the attitude  of  manytithe-payers to ecclesiastical questions.  There is a general feeling that tithe rentcharge is a payment whose history makes its con-tinuance unsuitable  to the circumstances of the present day just asthe  copyhold  system of  land holding has been judged to be unsnit-ahle; the strength of this feeling is unfortunately not diminished bythe  fact that it  is unjust to hold the present generation of tithe-owners responsible for the situation which they  have inherited.   59.  The  main difficulties disclosed by  our  evidence  may  besummarised as follows :        (1) The  tithe-owner  is  in a position similar to that of a     creditor in  relation  to  the owner  of land, whether  owner-     occupier or landlord of an occupying tenant.  But the claim of* Paras. 151 to 157.
   the  tithe-owner is not based upon any direct service which he   himself or his predecessor in title has rendered to the land; it   is unlike a claim for  rent by an agricultural landlord who not   only puts the land and buildings at the disposal of the tenant   but  who also usually does repairs, or a claim  of  a mortgagee   for the interest on principal money lent.   It is true that if the   land has been bought by the landowner or  his ancestors since   1836 the purchase has been made with full  knowledge, or at any   rate opportunity of knowledge, of the existence and amount of   the  charge, and that it has been, or should have been, taken into   account in fixing the  purchase price.   And,  equally, if the land   has since 1836 passed by inheritance only, the charge takes the   place.of  an  earlier immemorial burden.  But this truth is not   readily accepted,  and  in time of agricultural depression the land-   owner, especially if he is an occupier with little capital, is apt to   resent the charge, and even in his resentment to exaggerate  its   importance.  This is specially so at the present time with owner-   occupiers who bought their land  at  the  time of high prices   shortly  after the end of the War a period when a very large   portion of English agricultural land changed hands ; some of our   witnesses estimated  that as much as 30 per cent, of the agri-   cultural land in the country has changed hands since 1919, and   that as much as 25 per cent, of the land is now held by owner-   occupiers who acquired it  during or since  the War.*   The   situation has further been rendered more difficult by the great   increase in wages and in the costs of repairs  and maintenance of   buildings which has occurred since the War. t     (2) The defence of  the  position of the  tithe-owner is also   embarrassed by the  fact that,  as already  explained, tithe rent-   charge  has no necessary relation to the actual value of the land   charged or its produce at the present time,  except in so far as   the provisions of Section 8 of the Act of  1891 come into play.   This is resented as  an injustice; it is immaterial for this pur-   pose to enquire  whether  the  resentment  is, or is not, well   founded; we have received several communications from tithe-   payers  arguing that  tithe rentcharge  ought still to preserve, as   aid tithes, a definite relation to the produce  of the  land, perhaps   the traditional one-tenth of the gross produce.$      (3) The tithe-owner thus has at any rate the appearance of   introducing  an unnecessary complication into the  business of    the cultivation of land.  In existing conditions he is very  fre-    quently represented  by Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty, a  large central-    ised organisation, which necessarily has to proceed upon regular   *  Minutes of Evidence, 3rd Day, page 71, para. 10,  and 9th Day, page  220,Questions 2940 to 2943.   t  See para. 39.   j  The collection of the tenth sheaf was disapproved by the economists  and,indeed, by all reasonable opinion, but it had the simplicity of a primitive institutionitid a direct relation to visible crops.
 principles of administration  and has a difficulty in ascertain- ing all relevant facts in every particular case.. The application of general principles must sometimes produce, or be thought to produce,  hardship in  individual cases in  spite of all efforts to maintain a just and sympathetic administration, and while we see no reason to  doubt that  the affairs of the Bounty are ad- ministered with efficiency and in a spirit  of humanity,  it is in- inevitable that some of its decisions involving,  as  occasionally they must, the payment of money by persons who can ill afford it,  should from time to time  arouse resentment;  this is the more so since the demand for tithe rentcharge  is not,  like in- come tax, dependent  on the means of the debtor.   (4) Tithe  rentcharge inherits also the traditional unpopu- clarity  of  the tithes for which it has been substituted; in the minds of many tithe-payers it is regarded with dislike as being associated with a Church to  which  they  do  not belong.   It is true and the answer has often been made that the religious beliefs  of tithe-payers and tithe-owners  are  on a  strict  view irrelevant to the  legal obligation to pay  tithe  rentcharge; as appears by the precedent of  Welsh  disestablishment, the pay- ment of tithe rentcharge would  not be affected were the whole of it to pass  from  ecclesiastical into lay hands. But the feeling is sincere; its existence gravely  complicates the  working of the present system and brings unpopularity  on the Church of England  as  the principal owner of tithe rentcharge.   It is uncertain  whether this unpopularity has been  diminished by the transfer  to  Queen Anne&apos;s  Bounty  of  the collection  of incumbents&apos; tithe rentcharge. On the one hand the incumbent may have been in an  invidious position in claiming money from parishioners  who often were not members  of his Church; on  the other hand he may often have been able  to judge better and more sympathetically the character of his tithe-payers and the value to  be attached to claims of inability to pay.  (5)  Another cause of unpopularity is  the  belief that tithe rentcharge is in the nature of a tax specially  levied upon  agri- culture. It is argued  that either other industries ought not to be free from a similar burden, or that agriculture ought in its turn to be liberated.  This feeling is strengthened by the know- ledge that in earlier times tithes were leviable upon the profits of at  any rate certain  non-agricultural industries.   Again, we doubt  whether this view of  the situation can  be  justified; a claim to  the immediate liberation  of  agriculture  from  tithe rentcharge  without payment is a  claim for a free  gift tolandowners of the  amount  of a legal  burden  affecting  their property; but the  belief exists that tithe rentcharge is a specialtax upon  agriculture and account of that  belief  must be taken as of a fact  which has an influence on present conditions.  (6)  It is generally  believed that the system  is  peculiar toEngland and Wales,  that it no  longer exists in Ireland and
    in Scotland exists only in a modified form.  It is represented    that  tithe rentcharge  is a  burden upon English  and Welsh    agriculture which has no parallel abroad, at any rate in Europe.    In Denmark a similar  system has been extinguished with the    aid of the State.  We express no opinion as  to  how  far the    allegation that English and Welsh agriculture is  handicapped    by tithe rentcharge in  competing with the agriculture of  other    countries is  justified, but here again  account  must  be taken    of a widely prevalent belief.      (7) It has frequently happened  that a  part  of  the land    comprised in one tithe area has been sold and no  formal    re-apportionment of the tithe rentcharge has been made under an    order of the Ministry a   procedure  which alone has  legal    validity  for re-adjusting the several burdens of the owners  of    the  tithe  area.    This   is specially the  case where, as  often    happens, some informal arrangement  only has been made on    the authority of auctioneers  at a sale of land. In such an event    the  tithe-owner  knows nothing  of what has  happened and    indeed whether he knows  of  what has happened or  not -is    entitled  to demand the full rentcharge from any owner of a    part of the land subject to the original and only  valid apportion-    ment.   The landowner paying has, it is  true,  the right  to    recover  contribution from the  other owners but this involves    complicated  and tiresome proceedings  if liability is  disputed,    and in many cases the  sums in dispute are too small to justify    litigation though the irritation,  produced is not for that reason    any less.  It is unnecessary  to emphasise the sense of injustice    which is felt by  an ordinary person who is called upon to pay    tithe  rentcharge  in respect  of another person&apos;s property; this    feeling is not allayed by his  power to recover contribution from    the other owners (a task always  difficult and often practically    impossible),  he  feels that he is thus being called upon to  act    as unpaid collector for the  tithe-owner.      (8) Under the existing law* there are no attractive facilities    at the present time for the redemption, at any rate of ecclesiasti-    cal tithe rentcharge, by a   single payment.    As  the  general    principle is that the price  of the redemption of a rentcharge    is the sum necessary  to purchase Government  Stock to the    amount  necessary to produce by the interest thereon an income    to the tithe-owner equal to  the  assumed net income derived by    him  from the rentcharge reckoned at the gross value  of 105,    redemption in view of  the  present high price  of  Government    Stock involves an expenditure which  few landowners  care  to    face.      (9) Last (and this has a  special importance at  the  present    day)  the stabilisation of tithe rentcharge by the  Act of 1925   * The law, past and present, will be found stated in detail in the evidence ofthe Ministry (Minutes of Evidence, 1st Day, page 7, paras. 48 to 61).
    at   105,  or  (with  the  added   4  10s. for redemption of    ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge vested in Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty)     109 10s., has been  the subject of much hostile criticism and    provoked much discontent.    It  is well  understood  by tithe-    payers  that  the  figure exceeds that which  would  now have    been applicable on the pre-war system of seven-year averages of    corn prices,  and it  is felt that the landowners expenses, in    particular the important items of repairs and wages,  have con-    siderably increased since the War.       (10) In the result, as the evidence  submitted by  the Lord    Chancellor&apos;s Department  shows, there  has  been  in  recent    years serious agitation in some districts, especially the heavily    tithed districts of  Bast Anglia  and Kent,  against  the  pay-    ment of tithe rentcharge an agitation which has occasionally    led to violent  manifestations  by tithe-payers and their sym-    pathisers.  We understand that  at the  present time the col-    lection  of tithe rentcharge is proceeding  with less difficulty-    a  fact  attributed  by some  of  our  witnesses  to the slight    improvement which has taken place in some agricultural prices.    We  fear,  however,  that  whenever  agriculture is  depressed    agitation of this  kind is liable to recur so long as the existing    system gives plausible ground  for its recrudescence.  We  need    not  insist upon  the desirability  of  removing the  ground for    such an agitation if this can be accomplished with a just  con-    sideration of all legitimate interests involved.                      General  Conclusions.  60. It has thus been no surprise to us to  find that a very large majority of our witnesses both tithe-payers and tithe-owners were agreed that  the  existing system  of  tithe  rentcharge  is unsatis-factory and that  its abolition on fair  and  equitable terms is highly desirable,  though  as to  the  terms  of  any  such  abolition  very different views were put  forward.  We concur in this consensus ofopinion,  &quot; An universal feeling whether well  or ill founded cannotsafely  be disregarded.&quot;   We find  that  in  the process of time thesystem has become, without fault on either side, inappropriate tocontemporary conditions  and a cause of regrettable and  avoidableirritation.   We believe  that the complete abolition of the system isthe only satisfactory method  of  dealing with  its  inherent andineradicable  difficulties and  is  a measure  urgently  needed  in theinterests not only of  all persons directly concerned,  whether tithe-payers or tithe-owners, but also of  the country as a whole.                           FART  II.                  SCHEME OF  EXTINGUISHMENT.                     Broad Lines  of  Scheme.  61.  Having arrived at the conclusion that  the present situationis such as to necessitate a scheme  for the total extinguishment of
tithe rentcharge, we proceed to consider the general lines of sucha scheme and the  practical considerations which arise in connec-tion with it.  62.  It is in the first place hardly  disputable that  without theassistance  of the  credit  and machinery of the State  any  such scheme cannot supply  the  remedies which the present  situationdemands.  The connection between the tithe-payer  and the tithe-owner must be severed at an early date.  This can only be done if the State assumes the  burden of paying  off the  tithe-owner onfair terms and collecting  from the  tithe-payer the  amount  whichhe can properly be asked  to pay.   The credit  of the State may inour judgment fairly  be  used for  a  national purpose  of  publicinterest and utility; the lower rate at which  the  State is  able to borrow will allow  the tithe-payer better terms for repayment ofthe advances  made, and the credit of the State will  give  an unim-peachable security  to the tithe-owner an advantage which he mayjustly  be  asked to recognise in the acceptance of a payment lessin amount than the present income derived  from tithe rentcharge.Not only is it true that the tithe-payer if left  to his own resourceswithout the help of the credit of the State could not in most casesraise a capital sum  for the immediate redemption of tithe rent-charge but  any plan by which the liability of the tithe-payer to thetitheowner were continued, whether in the form of the obligation topay annuities or otherwise,  would  assuredly  give rise to friction and difficulty in its actual operation and would not set the ques-tion at rest.  We  see, therefore, no way of achieving the generalredemption of tithe rentcharge (for which as already noted* therewas a  consensus  of opinion  amongst  the  majority  of witnesses,,both  those  representing tithe-payers and those representing tithe-owners) other than that the amount needed  for capital redemptionshould be advanced by the State.  It must also not  be forgotten that many of the present difficulties as to tithe  rentcharge, and  notably those connected with the inci-dence of local rates and their bearing on the figures of an extinguish-ment scheme, t are in the main the result of legislation, some of it ofrecent date.  63.  By a series  of Acts  of  Parliament  (described  in  the foot-note to paragraph 98 of this Beport), the State has given substantialrelief  to  owners of  ecclesiastical  tithe rentcharge  in respect ofrates, and  finally  in  the Tithe Act,  1925, has assumed liability for payment  of the whole of the rates on  such tithe rentcharge,subject to contributions of  5 per  100&apos; tithe rentcharge (par value)in the case of rentcharge  previously attached to benefices and  16per  100 tithe rentcharge  (par value) in the  case  of rentchargepreviously owned  by ecclesiastical corporations.  The Act of 1925provided for  a scheme of redemption  of ecclesiastical tithe  rent-charge by sinking fund payments over periods of 81J and  85 yearst     * See para. 60.      i See paras. 96 to 101.     :f See para. 37 (c).   30944                                                     B
 and the State&apos;s liability in regard to rates on ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge will continue under the existing law for those  periods. The State&apos;s payments have averaged approximately  550,000  per annum over the three years ended 31st March,  1934, these pay- ments forming a statutory charge upon the Consolidated Fund.   64. Under the existing law the rates  payable in  respect of tithe rentcharge, both ecclesiastical and  lay,  cease when the tithe rent- charge  is  redeemed, and the disappearance of a rateable heredita- ment does not give rise to any claim for compensation  or otherwise by a local  authority.  It may, however,  be recalled that but for the provisions  of  the  Local Government  Act, 1929,  by which  agricul- tural land  was completely derated the abolition of tithe rentcharge would have meant an increase  in  the rateable value  of  the land affected.   65. Thus the State by a  series of deliberate acts has complicated the problem; the value of  ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge has been increased  for  purposes of redemption (though the  annual burden on the tithe-payer  has not thereby been  affected), and  the increase in the rateable  value of  agricultural  land which  would under  the earlier law have resulted from the abolition of tithe rentcharge  has been destroyed.   There is thus a very strong case  for claiming that in the final settlement of the tithe question which we are called upon to provide, any gap which  may exist between what it is fair that the tithe-payer should contribute and. what it is fair that the tithe- owner should receive  should  be provided  by the  State.   Tithe owners and tithe-payers have an equitable claim to State assistance especially  when the claim  is  made in  a form  which,  as  appear later, involves no  additional subsidy  from the State  whether to tithe-owner or to tithe-payer.   The scheme which commends itself  to our  judgment is, in its main lines, set out in the next following seven paragraphs.   66. The State should expropriate the tithe-owners by compulsor; purchase.   The price paid to the tithe-owners should be based or the annual value of tithe rentcharge calculated in accordance with the recommendations which  we develop later,*  the annual value being capitalised at the prevailing rate  of interest, which  in  the illustrative figures given in a  later paragraph we assume to be 3 per cent.  67. The  consideration to  be given by  the State should take  theform  of  Government stock issued to  the tithe-owners a  stock which  in  the illustration which we give later t  is taken  to bear interest at 3 per cent., this stock might, if deemed desirable, cany an obligation  for redemption  at par at the end of a stated period such as  40 years.   We would propose as one of our witnesses urgedj that tithe-owners should have the right  freely to  dispose of the stock issued to them.               * See paras. 76 to 108.      f See para. 119.            X Minutes of Evidence, 19th Day, page 574, para. 12.
  68. The  interest of the tithe-owners  in tithe rentcharge shouldterminate upon the  appointed day on  which the purchase takeseffect, except as regards any rights they may have to  collect arrearsoutstanding at that date.  As from the appointed day the paymentof tithe rentcharge  should cease  and  in  lieu  thereof tithe-payersshould  be liable for  the  payment to the  State of  what it will be convenient to call &quot; redemption annuities &quot; ;  these annuities to befixed at the fair annual value of the rentcharge, to  be payable half-yearly,  and to terminate in 40 years.  69. We think it right* that these redemption annuities  should,in view of  the  fact  that  the  Treasury  will escape  the  con-tribution which it makes at present  to the payment of the local rates of the ecclesiastical tithe-owner, be supplemented by a con-tribution from the Exchequer; the combination  of  the  annuitieswith this contribution will enable  full provision  to be  made  forthe  payment of interest on the issue of Government stock and forthe  creation of  a sinking fund adequate  to redeem  that stock  in40 years.!  70. The  redemption  annuities,  as  already indicated, will notexceed  the fair  annual value of the existing  tithe rentcharge andwe  consider^ that in the  case of agricultural  land  they ought not,for  each holding  taken  as a whole, to  amount to more than one-third of the annual value of the land as assessed for  the purpose of schedule B to the Income Tax Acts.  71. We attribute great importance  to the early  reduction of theannual amount  at present paj&apos;able  by tithe-payers;  any  amending legislation  which may  be introduced  to implement this  Beportshould  provide for the reduction becoming effective as soon as maybe after the passing of any new Act.  72.  A large  amount of detailed work will  be necessary  for theestablishment of  the new system, in  particular  for determining the  compensation payable to  separate tithe-owners on  the  prin-ciples adopted  in  the scheme and the amounts of the  redemptionannuities  payable by tithe-payers.  Tor  these purposes we  pro-pose that  a special  Temporary Commission  be   set up  with all necessary powers subject  to the  control of  the  High  Court  ofJustice  on  points  of  law.   * See paras. 114 to 117.   t To those who are not acquainted  with all factors of the problem of titherentcharge it may at first sight seem surprising that 40 annuities of an amount equalto the annual value of tithe rentcharge  plus a moderate contribution from theTreasury should be capable not only of meeting the  annual interest of a loan raised to secure  to tithe-owners  an income based on  that  same annual value but also of applying the sinking fund capable of extinguishing the loan.  The key to the riddleis to be found in the fact that what has to be secured to the tithe-owner is his net income derived from tithe rentcharge, and that this net  income is only ascertainedsfter the deduction of considerable outgoings.  If this were not the case and if thenet income of the tithe-owner were more nearly equal to the annual yield of titherentcharge it would be necessary to demand considerably larger contributions from either the tithe-payers or the Treasury or both of them.   t See para. 124.   30944                                                      B 2
                Stabilised  Value  of  Tithe Rentcharge.   73. Such  being the main  lines  of  the scheme the  first question to&quot; be considered is that  of  the manner in  which and the  figure at which for the purposes of the  scheme the value of tithe rent- charge must be fixed.   74. A suggestion was made to us* that for  this purpose  we might adopt the figures of the prices stated to have been realised in recent years on the sale of such few parcels of lay tithe rentcharge as have come into the  market at  the instance of individual owners.    We cannot  accept  this suggestion.  There is in fact no  free  and open market  quotation for tithe rentcharge ; its nature and characteristics are not  generally understood ; the great bulk of it is never bought or sold; such transactions as take  place  are too rare in their occasions and  too  much  governed  by  particular  circumstances  to permit of their affording  a reliable indication of the value to be put on tithe rentcharge as a whole.   75. Equally, we do not think that the valuation placed or accepted by the Inland Revenue  authorities for the purpose of death duties upon parcels of tithe  rentcharge forming part  of the  estate of  a deceased lay  tithe-owner  can properly  be accepted as providing  a fair  basis  for  an  estimate  of  the value of  all  tithe rentcharge. Such valuations are, we believe, based on estimates of what would be realised for the property upon a  sale under the market conditions prevailing at  the time of  death.  In  any such valuation particular conditions must play a large  part  and the  general problem of  the valuation of  tithe rentcharge as a  whole does not come before  the Revenue authorities  upon an individual occasion, t   76. We turn to the consideration of the stabilised figure  of  105$ fixed  under  the Tithe Act,  1925,  for  every  100 tithe rentcharge (par value) and we ask ourselves whether it is just that this figure be retained.5    * Minutes of Evidence, 7th Day, page  148, para. 5.    t Minutes of Evidence, 1st Day, Question 317.    J A figure which in the case of ecclesiastical tithe  rentcharge is increased by 4 10s. for the formation of a sinking fund for redemption.    5 It may be well to note at the outset that  the  actual amounts involved for individuals differ widely and are often  small.  For convenience, and as  was donein the Tithe Act, 1925, we propose to adopt the usual practice of taking a figureof  100 tithe rentcharge (par value) as the statistical unit, but the following  points should be borne in mind :     (a) the actual amounts of  tithe rentcharge payable  annually in respect of       particular pieces of land vary  from a few pence upwards ;   (b) the total amount of tithe rentcharge owned by an individual tithe-owner       may be considerably more or less than  100;   (c) a farm charged with tithe  rentcharge at the rate of 3s. 4d. an acre  (par       value), the average for  the whole  of England and Wales, would be liable       to  100  tithe  rentcharge  (par  value) only if it comprised  an area of       600 acres ; if the tithe  rentcharge were double the average rate, namely,       6s. 8d. an acre, the area of a farm liable to  100 tithe rentcharge (par  value)       would be 300 acres. Of the 388,433 agricultural holdings in England  and       Wales returned as existing in 1933, only 11,870 exceeded 300 acres,  and it       must not,  therefore, be assumed that  100 tithe rentcharge (par value)       is an amount comparable with the normal annual liability of an agricultural       holding.                                                       I
    77. We were informed by the Ministry that the stabilised figure   of  105 was intended to represent the fair perpetuity equivalent of    100&apos; tithe rentcharge (par value)  which varied from year to year,   on the basis of the quindecennial average* of prices of wheat, barley   and oats in the proportion laid down in the Tithe Act,  1836. t   Itiwill  be obvious that the  fixing of a  stabilised value on this basis   involved, among other things, a forecast as  to the  probable  trend   of corn prices over a long period of years.  It is unnecessary for us   to point  out the difficulty of making such a  forecast.   The ability   to do this would enable a private person to amass a fortune.    78. The  position  in  1935  was critical; legislation was urgently   needed.  In the absence  of legislation, as we have already noted,   the annual value of  100! tithe rentcharge (par value) would in 1926   have risen under the 1918 Act, which was then in  force, to a figure   exceeding  130; this would have meant immediate and  substantial   increase in the tithe-payer&apos;s liability, while the tithe-owner,  apart   from a probable difficulty in collection, might have  laid himself open   to the criticism that he was receiving an immediate benefit which   would class him as a &quot; war profiteer  &quot;.    79. So far as we can ascertain, the principle of stabilisation was   not strongly opposed in 1925, although it is true that the figure of   105 was criticised in certain quarters.   On the part of certain tithe-   owners it was  argued  that the figure was too low;  on  the part of   tithe-payers that it was too high; but the fact that during the pas-j  sage  of the Bill  through  Parliament  no amendment was actually   moved to provide that the figure should be less than  100 seems to   show  that nobody at that time saw sufficient reason to challengeI  seriously the estimate  which had been  made and  embodied in  the   Bill.   It is, however,  significant that the representatives of tithe-;   owners who have appeared before us have not sought to controvertI  the suggestion  that if it had been  possible to  estimate in 1925  the   actual course of corn prices during  the period from that date to  the   present time,  the stabilised  figure would not  have been fixed  so   high  as 105 ; their argument has not been carried  further than  the   contention that a period of only ten  years yields an experience  in-M sufficient to demonstrate that the stabilised figure is too high. what i would be the period  which would have to elapse before it would be is proper to review the stabilised figure is a point on which the evidence   given was silent.    80.  In  these conditions we have felt bound to take  into considera-   tion the question of a revision of the stabilised figure in the light of   the experience of the  whole period which has elapsed  since  1836   and of the probable future tendencies.  The stabilised  figure of 1925,   we may again emphasise, was  in the nature  of a  prophecy and if     *  See para. 37(a), and Minutes of Evidence, 1st Day, pages  15 and 16, Questions   14 and 15.     t  See para. 18.     30944                                                   B 3
 that prophecy has not been, and shows no probability of being, ful- filled, it cannot be equitable to continue to enforce that figure upon the parties interested.   We do not, of course, claim that the figure which we recommend will necessarily prove correct,  but we may point out that the payments  by the tithe-payer, which we  propose to  base  on this figure,  will be made  for forty years only a con- siderably shorter period than the  85 years  (or, for  lay  tithe rent- charge,  perpetuity) to which the figure  of  1925  was intended  to apply.  81.  The evidence* which was placed before us as to  the probable trend of corn prices established in our judgment that it  is unlikely that the maintenance of the existing stabilised figure of   105 for a prolonged  period will be justified.  82. In considering what ought  to  be the  figure  on  which the rights of the parties interested should, for the purpose of the redemp- tion scheme which we propose, be based, we think  that the best and safest method is to assume that the experience of  the past is likely to be  repeated.  But in taking the past for our guide we  feel bound to omit the years in which prices must be  regarded as mainly, or  to a considerable extent, determined by  the Great  War.   We think that for  the  purpose of arriving  at  a fair estimate of  the future annual value of tithe rentcharge it would be just and proper  to omitthat period from consideration.  83.  The  period of 80 years  commencing in 1837 and terminating in 1916 includes times of war and peace, of agricultural  prosperity and depression,  of  fluctuating interest rates and varying values  ofmoney.  Thus that period is in our opinion  sufficiently long and covers a sufficiently wide variation of conditions to justify  taking theaverage rate at which tithe rentcharge was payable  during that time as the basis which it would be fair to all parties to adopt for deter- mining the gross annual value of tithe rentcharge for the  purpose  ofits  extinguishment.   This average  annual rate was  91 Ils. 2d. per  100 (par value).  We recommend that this  figure  should be adopted in place of  105 as the basis of the gross annual value of all tithe rentcharge, no matter by whom owned  and, it is hardly neces- sary to add, without regard to the uses to  which it is put.  84.  We  have carefully  considered,  whether, in arriving  at  our recommendations as  to  the  gross  annual value,  we should adopt some  other basis than corn prices.  If the question of  determining the value of  tithe rentcharge, whether as  a  stabilised or as  a vari- able figure, were  now being approached  for  the  first time there would be much to be said for  determining  that value by a figure based on the prices, duly weighted, of all agricultural produce in England and Wales.   And, indeed, it is probable  that whatever may be  the  basis on which the gross annual value of tithe rent- charge is determined,  public  opinion  will tend  in  the   future  to       *  Minutes of Evidence, 20th Day, Questions 7465-6 and 7547-51.
227ftjudge the fairness  of  the result by the course of all agricultural prices rather than by corn prices only.  But we do not feel justifiednow in recommending  a departure from what has been the acceptedbasis for tithe rentcharge since 1836  and we  conceive it  properthat, as we are proposing that the estimate made in 1925  shouldbe revised, we should address ourselves to the same problem asthat  which then  fell to  be settled.  We have thus arrived  at theconclusion that it is undesirable to  adopt any other measure for theliability of the tithe-payer,  especially as our proposals will, if adopted,  result in  the extinguishment of  tithe rentcharge  withina comparatively short  period.*              Determination of Net Annual Value.  85. Having  reached  the conclusion that  a figure of  91 11s. 2d.per  100 tithe rentcharge  (par value) would be a fair figure to take as representing the gross annual value of  tithe  rentcharge as pay-able by the tithe-payer  for the purpose of dealing with its  extinguish-ment, we have next to consider what  should be the  correspondingnet annual value for  the purpose  of  determining the  amount ofcompensation which the  tithe-owner can properly claim upon theextinguishment of his tithe rentcharge.   It  will not, we conceive, bedisputed that the compensation to the present owners of tithe rent-charge under a scheme of general  extinguishment must be  basedupon net and not upon gross value.   Thus a deduction must be madefor the local rates in so far  as they have  to be paid in respect of the rentcharge by the tithe-owner a  subject which  we discussmore fully  in later  paragraphs.!  Further, the tithe-owner  has to incur costs in  the  collection  of his rentcharge and in some casesalso tithe rentcharge is subject to land  tax.  Deductions in respectof all these items have been  a feature of  the statutory  method ofcalculating the redemption money  since the operation of the  TitheAct,  1918,? and they must be taken into  consideration  in dealingwith  any general scheme of  extinguishment.  86. In  addition to these items, regard must also be had  to thefact that the  income  of  a tithe-owner  from tithe rentcharge is subject to  diminution  as  the result of  bad  debts;  in  so far  assuch  diminution has an  economic  origin  and is  not an  artificialconsequence of any  agitation,  it must be taken into account even if only a rough estimate of its extent is possible.  87. Tithe rentcharge is also  liable to  abatement on  account ofany remission which may  be claimable under Section 8 of the TitheAct, 1891 .g_   * It may be added that an examination of the index numbers which are givenin the Appendix to the  evidence of  the Ministry (Minutes  of Evidence, 1st Day,page 43) for corn prices and wholesale food prices will  show that while naturally the movements of the two sets of figures are not completely parallel, the variations are,lor the greater part of the period covered by the tables of the Ministry, not widelydivergent.   t  See paras. 96 to 103.   t  See Tithe Act, 1918, 1st Schedule, and Tithe Act, 1925, section 9 (1).   5 See para. 32.   30944                                       -              B 4
  88. As it is proposed in our scheme for extinguishing tithe rent-charge to provide the present tithe-owners with an income from aGovernment security, we think it is not unfair  to take into con-si deration the  fact  that  an income from  a Government securitywould not be  subject to diminution on account  of  bad debts orremissions and, in general, would  constitute a superior security.               Cost of Collection and Management.  89. The Tithe  Act, 1918,  provided  that in calculating the net annual value of tithe rentcharge for the purpose of redemption, areduction not  exceeding  2J per cent,  of  the gross  annual valueshould be made in respect of the cost of collection.  The Tithe Act,1925, fixed the deduction for the same purpose at 2  per cent, ofthe gross annual value in the case of ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge.  90. In order to arrive at the  proper deduction on this headfrom  the gross annual value of the rentcharge to the tithe-owner,we  have taken into consideration the evidence which we receivedfrom  a number of tithe-owners as to their  experience of the actual cost of  collection of  tithe rentcharge.   As  to  ecclesiastical titherentcharge, the Governors of Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty  informed us that the cost of  collection through  their Area Committees for theyear 1933 was  3 6s. 6d. per  100 tithe  money.*  This cost didnot include the expenses of the central administration of the Bountyin connection with ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge, which  amountedto  28,000 in 19341  and which we have been  subsequently  in-formed are expected to total  20,000 to  24,000 per  annum under normal conditions.  In addition bank charges have had to be melas a  result of loans incurred with  a  view  of  preventing suddenvariations in  the income of the clergy derived from tithe rent-charge.   From whatever sources these  expenses  and  charges are met they constitute part  of the Bounty&apos;s expenses of management,and,  if a fair  addition be made on  these  heads, we find that thetotal  cost of collection and management to Queen Anne&apos;s Bountywould not be less than  5 per  100.  91. The Commissioners of  Church Temporalities  in Wales  in-formed  us that the cost  of collection, of delay in payment  and of management  aggregated  in  normal times to 7J  per cent.,  andthat  it  was  their practice to employ  collecting  agents who were paid  on  a percentage basis,  two being paid at  the  rate of 5 peicent, and two at 4 per  cent.,  a  special  addition being  made inparticular areas  where  collection  was  difficult.J   The  Commis-sioners emphasised that this  figure was one  for normal times, andwould have been increased during recent years, g    *  Minutes of Evidence, 14th Day, page  382, para. 10.    t  Minutes of Evidence, 14th Day, page  387, para. 22.

 92. The Bursars of the Oxford Colleges stated that the probableaverage  cost of collection  to  the Colleges would  be about  5  percent- *  We  were also informed  by an individual lay tithe-ownerthat he estimated his cost of collection at  5 per cent.! 93. The Board of Inland  Revenue also gave  evidence  that in determining  the market value of tithe rentcharge for the purpose of death duties, it  was their practice to deduct 5  per  cent,  of  theamount collected as representing  the cost  of collection.% 94. From  this evidence we  draw the conclusion that  the deduc-tion made in  accordance  with  the  Tithe Acts,  1918  and  1925,of 2-3- per cent, does not adequately  represent the actual costs of collection to the  tithe-owner,  and we are of opinion that  a  fairfigure  to be taken  for the purpose  of assessing  the net  annual value would  be 5  per cent, of  the gross annual value, as  represent-ing  the  cost of collection  in  normal  times.  In  view of the  factthat we  are  suggesting that the gross  annual  value for the purposeof extinguishment should be considered to be   91  11s. 2d. in placeof the  105 established under the 1925  Act, we think that  the fair  proportionate deduction for costs  of collection might be taken at 4 Ils. 6d. per   100 tithe rentcharge (par value).                          Land Tax. 95. Not all  tithe  rentcharge is  subject to land tax  and, con-sequently, the deduction which should be made  in respect of la&quot;ndtax  must vary as it has to be  based on the actual liabilities inrespect of land tax of the particular tithe-owner; following  the precedent of the Tithe  Act, 1918, the average tax paid or payable by  the tithe-owner  for  the three years immediately preceding thedate of the  operation of the scheme  should  be  taken.   As  to thegeneral effect of this deduction on the finance of the extinguish-ment  scheme,  we  understand  from figures  furnished  by  the governors of Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty  that the amount of land taxpaid by them in the last three years averaged   1 0s. 8d. per annumper   100 tithe rentcharge (par value) vested in them.    On  this basis it is  reasonable  to assume that  an  average  deduction ofapproximately  1 per   100 (par value) will  fall to be made overthe  whole field  of tithe rentcharge  included  in the extinguish-ment scheme, and we have accordingly adopted that ratio for thepurposes of  the  illustrative figures given later in this Report.                          Local Bates.  96.  Tithe  rentcharge, as we have  already seen,  is the  subjectof local  rates,  but recent legislation has created in this connectiona wide  difference between the position of the owner of lay titherentcharge on the one hand  and the owner  of  ecclesiastical titherentcharge on the other.        * Minutes of Evidence, 18th Day, page 526, para. IV(3).        t Minutes of Evidence, 19th Day, page 587,  Question 7003.        j Minutes of Evidence, 1st day, page 35, para. 19.
   97. The  lay tithe-owner still  pays  the full amount of  local rates leviable  in respect  of his rentcharge in accordance  with the  law as to rating*,  as if it was a  corporeal  hereditament, though  it  is true  that when  the question  of redemption  arises the  position  of the  payer of lay tithe rentcharge in so  far  as he  owns agricultural land subject to that charge has been altered  by the fact that agri- cultural  land is no longer rateable and that, therefore, rates payable by  him or  his tenant  are not increased as  a result of redemption.   98. For  &quot; ecclesiastical &quot;  tithe rentcharge, i.e.  tithe rentcharge owned by Queen Anne&apos;s  Bounty in trust for incumbents of bene- benefices and  ecclesiastical  corporations  and also certain  tithe  rent- charge vested in the Welsh Commissioners, the position is different, t     * Under the Public Health Act, 1875, the owner of any tithe rentcharge and the occupier of agricultural land was made liable for one-quarter only of the general district rate in urban districts and of the special  expenses rate in rural districts.    f  The  history of the successive measures by which the occupier of agricultural land and the owner of ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge have been given relief in respect of rates may be summarised as follows :-    The Agricultural Rates Act,  1898,  relieved  agricultural land of payment of one-half of  the rates (except as regards a rate which the occupier was liable to pay in the proportion of one-half or less than one-half), the deficiency being made up out of the  Local Taxation Account.    In 1899, following on the  Second Report of the  Royal Commission on Local Taxation, the Tithe Rentcharge (Rates)  Act was passed ;  this Act put the owner of the  rentcharge attached to a  benefice in  the same position as the occupier ofagricultural land under  the Agricultural  Rates Act,  1896, the relief being againgranted through the Local Taxation Account.    This position still obtains in relation to Welsh tithe rentcharge formerly attachedto benefices and now vested in the Welsh Commissioners. On the occasion of thetransfer of  such tithe rentcharge to the Welsh Commissioners, the Welsh ChurcliAct,  1919, provided that so long as any such tithe rentcharge remained vested in the Commissioners they  should continue to enjoy the  relief formerly given to suchtithe rentcharge by the  Act of 1899.    The next  measure giving relief to owners of ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge waicontained in the Ecclesiastical Tithe Rentcharge (Rates) Act, 1920; this providedfor the following reliefs which obtained from the 1st April, 1920, to the 1st October, 1926 :-         Ownership of Tithe Rentcharge.Tithe rentcharge attached to a benefice :-  Income not exceeding  300...  Income exceeding   300 but not    exceeding  500.  Income exceeding  500Nature  of  Temporary Relief from              Rates.Complete exemption.One-quarter of rates on 1918 pound-  age payable.One-half of rates on 1918 pour  payable.Rates on 1918 poundage payable.       Tithe rentcharge owned by ecclesiastical-         tical corporations.     If regard be had to the date of the Act and the period for which the relief was granted, it seems clear that this Act was a more or less direct  consequence of fiepassing of the Tithe Act, 1918, to which reference has already been made, and whitthad stabilised the annual value of tithe rentcharge for a  period of seven years at 109 3s. Ild per  100 tithe rentcharge (par value).  The relief under the Act of 19!&quot;&quot;was given at the expense  of the other rate-payers in the district and not, like thereliefs under the Acts of 1896  and 1899, through the Local Taxation Account andat the  expense of the taxpayer.

As to the tithe  rentcharge vested in the Welsh Church Com-missioners,  the  Commissioners in respect  of  so much of it  as was previously attached to benefices  in  Wales pay only half  rates, theother half being discharged by the Inland Revenue Authorities, thesum so  paid being  charged upon the Consolidated Bund.  100.  This difference in the respective positions  of the  owners oflay  and ecclesiastical  tithe rentcharge  in  relation to local rates  is reflected in the statutory provisions at present in force as to redemp-tion.  The redemption terms fixed under the Tithe Acts,  1918 and1925,  provide for  the  deduction of  the average amount  paid by thetithe owner in respect of rates during the three years immediately preceding redemption^ and so assure to the owners of ecclesiasticaltithe rentcharge  (including the Welsh  Commissioners) the  benefitof the payments  made  by  the Treasury  on account of the  ratesleviable in respect of  the tithe rentcharge under redemption.   the lay  tithe owner, apart from the provisions of Section 17  (2) of theTithe  Act of 19251, enjoys no similar benefit and the terms of re-redemption in his case take into account  the fact that on redemptionof his tithe rentcharge he escapes liability for rates.  101. It thus appears to be clear, when  we come to consider theterms to be fixed for  redemption under our scheme, that, as tithe-owners  on the extinguishment of their rentcharges will escape thepayment of rates, the compensation to be paid them must  be cal-culated  on the basis  of  a deduction from the gross value of  theirtithe  rentcharge  of  an amount   fairly  representing  the   actualburdens in respect ^f  local rates which  they respectively  avoid, the calculation in the case of the lay  tithe owner being made  on thefull amount of the rates  and  not on two-thirds only of that amount   la  1923 a further Agricultural Rates Act was passed, which had  the effect ofrelieving agricultural  land  of three-quarters of the  rates.   Under the Tithe Act,  1925, the existing relief to owners  of ecclesiastical titherentcharge was abolished;  in lieu thereof it was  enacted that the liability of QueenAnne&apos;s Bounty should be limited to a payment of  5 per  100  tithe rentcharge (parvalue) formerly attached to a benefice and of  16 per  100 tithe rentcharge formerlybelonging to an ecclesiastical corporation, and that subject to those payments allrates on tithe rentcharge vested in Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty, that is, tithe rentchargewhich immediately before the  1st April, 1927, was attached to a benefice or owned by an ecclesiastical corporation, should be paid by the Commissioners of InlandRevenue, the amount paid being made a charge upon the Consolidated Fund.   Finally, under the Local Government Act, 1929, agricultural land and agriculturalbuildings were wholly de-rated.   It will be seen that the relief  of the  owner of ecclesiastical tithe rentchargefrom liability for rates  has followed or accompanied the similar relief given to agricultural land.    * See para. 51.   t See para. 54.
 as, in cases where the application for  redemption is  made by the owner of agricultural  land, is  provided by Section 17  (2) of the Tithe Act,  1925.*    102. As we propose that the gross  annual value  of  tithe  rent- charge should be reduced from  105 to  91 11s. 2d. per  100 tithe rentcharge  (par value),  the figure of deduction for rates should be reduced  to  that which would have  been the  amount payable had the gross annual  value  of   91  11s.  2d. been in  operation in the three years  preceding the entry in force  of the scheme  of extinguish- ment. If found practicable, this adjustment should be made in the form  of  a percentage  reduction applicable to the whole country. Similarly, as the contributions  of  5 and  16 per  100 tithe  rent- charge (par value) vested in Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty were based on tithe  rentcharge of a gross  annual value of  105,  and as the gross annual value is  under our scheme reduced to  91 11s.  2d., it would be just that the deductions of  5 and  16 should be proportionately reduced to  4 7s. 2d. and  13 19s. respectively.   103. As to &quot;the  average amount  of rates payable  in  respect of tithe  rentcharge,  we estimate  this  provisionally  on  the  basis of rates  at  10s. in the    at  28 19s.  lid. per  100  tithe rentcharge (par value).t   104. The  deduction  for rates in  respect of various types  of tithe rentcharge classified according to ownership and history will  thus work  out on average figures as follows :  Queen Anne&apos;s  Bounty                                  ,   s.   (a)  Tithe  rentcharge previously  attached to benefices    4   7   (b)  Tithe  rentcharge previously owned by Bcclesias-          tical Corporations              ...     ...      ...   13 19  0 Welsh Commissioners    Tithe  rentcharge previously attached to  benefices  in          Wales      ...    ...............14 10  0 All  other owners  of  tithe rentcharge   ...     ...      ...   28 19  11    * See para. 54.    f We are informed by the Ministry of Health that the average poundage figuresfor all rating districts in England and Wales for the years ending 31st March, 1933,1934 and 1935 were 10s. 10d., 10s. 9 d. and 10s. 8fd., respectively.    It is, however, fairly clear that as  between urban and rural areas the average rate was slightly lower in the rural than in the urban, and as the greater proportionof tithe rentcharge arises in rural areas, our estimates have been based on an averagepoundage of 10s. in the   for the whole country.    This estimate is reached in the following way :                                                                  s. i     Gross collectable value of tithe renteharge  ...    ...    ...    ...   91 11 2        Deduct 5 per cent, for cost of collection, etc.......    ...    411 6Deduct rates (on the basis of 10s. in the  )86 19  828 19 11Assessable value 57 19  9
                   Improvement of Security.  105.  As explained above,  we consider it just to take  into con-sideration,in assessing the net annual value,the fact that an income from a Government security is better secured than one derived fromtithe rentcharge; it is not liable  to diminution by bad debts and statutory or voluntary remissions, and is not exposed  to the same difficulties in collection and  management.  One of our witnesses*suggested for the purpose  of an extinguishment scheme  which he put forward on the basis of a gross  annual value of  105 per  100tithe rentcharge (par value), that a deduction should be made  of 12 10s. to  represent the cost of  collection and the loss of income which it would be reasonable to ask tithe owners to sacrifice in viewof the improvement in the quality of the security.  As  has alreadyappeared, we have considered that the deduction for cost of collec-tion should be  4  11s. 6d. per  100 tithe  rentcharge (par value) ;having  regard   to  the  fact  that   the tithe  rentcharge  wouldtheoretically be  easier to collect and be better  secured if the grossannual value were  91 11s. 2d. instead of  105 per cent., we thinkthat it would be sufficient that a deduction of  5 per  100 titherentcharge (par  value) were made from the income yielded by theGovernment security in consideration of  its  freedom from lossescaused by bad debts and,  directly or indirectly, from the existing statutory remissions.                        Chancel Repairs.  106. A further  liability  which may  afitach to the  owner  ofrectorial  tithe rentcharge is  that for repairs to the chancel of the parish  church.   So far as this liability may at present  attach to  aspiritual  rector,  to an ecclesiastical corporation or to the  ecclesiastical-tical Commissioners  we conceive  that no special steps  need betaken as a result of the disappearance of such tithe rentcharge, butin so far as the liability  may  attach to  other persons  or bodies in the capacity of lay rector we have considered whether steps should be taken, in connection with the  scheme we propose  forextinguishment  of tithe rentcharge, to make a deduction from the gross  annual value of  the  tithe rentcharge in  consequence of thisliability.   We do not think it desirable, however,  that  the schemefor extinguishment should be held up  in its preliminary stages inorder that the question of this liability, which  will vary as regardseach particular  tithe  rentcharge, should  be explored  and  finally settled, t  We accordingly recommend that the amending legisla-tion which  will be necessary if our general  recommendations are adopted, should give  the Diocesan  Authority  within  some limited time power  to serve on any  owner of tithe rentcharge  (other thana spiritual rector, an ecclesiastical corporation, or the EcclesiasticalCommissioners)  who  is responsible for the repair of  a  chancel  a   * Minutes of Evidence, 19th Day, page 574, para. 10.   t In some cases  the liability may attach to other property as well as tothe tithe rentcharge.
notice requiring him,  within a period of (say) six months, to pay to the Diocesan Authority  such  sum as, in accordance with Sec-tion  52 of &apos;the  Eoclesiasitical  Dilapidations  Measure,  1927,  asamended   by  the  Ecclesiastical   Dilapidations   (Amendment)Measure,  1929, is  required for the cost of future repairs to thechancel and for fire insurance.   In  default of agreement betweensuch tithe owner and  the Diocesan Authority as to the amount tobe  paid, the  matter  should be  referred to arbitration,  and  any amount agreed upon or awarded should be recoverable by action inthe County Court, as the Court which is already charged under theChancel Repairs Act,  1932, with the duty of enforcing liability to repair chancels in England.  Pending a final settlement the Tem-porary  Commission should have power lat  &quot;the request of  theDiocesan Authority  to retain  a part of the stock proposed  to  beissued as compensation for the tithe rentcharge sufficient in amountto satisfy the claim.

These are then the approximate figures which, on the plan which we propose, should form the basis of the compensation to begiven  to tithe owners.  It is, however, necessary to bear in mind that the figures are susceptible to variation, not only as betweenparticular tithe owners, but also  as between particular parcels of the rentcharge in the same ownership, having regard to the actualoutgoings dependent on poundage  of rates and liability to land tax.            Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty  Sinking Fund.  109. The  redemption payments  of  4 10s.  per  100 (par value)of tithe rentcharge which are made under the Act of 1925 by thepayer  of ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge to Queen Anne&apos;s  Bounty,were in  December,  1934,  represented  by the sum of  1,059,081Local  Loans&apos;3 per cent, stock.   It is estimated that this figure willbe increased to  1,369,281 by April, 1936, if it be assumed       (1) that all arrears of tithe rentcharge including  the half-   yearly instalment due on the  1st April, 1936, are paid up and   the appropriate sums invested ;      (2)  that the amounts withheld from the sinking fund under    Section 5 (1) (ii) of the Act of 1925 are included; and      (3) that the price  of Government  securities remains un-    changed in the interim.
We  have  accordingly  adopted  the  figure  of  1,369,281  as the valuation of the accumulated fund for the purpose of the illustra-tive  figures given later in the Eeport.  The existence of the fundthus constituted raises a point of some importance to the finance ofthe  scheme.  We propose that this fund  should  be retained byQueen Anne&apos;s  Bounty,  and that the amount  of  stock  or cashpayable  to the  Bounty on  account  of the compensation payable for the extinguishment of the Bounty interest should,  pro tanto,be reduced.  We do not think  that in view of the desirability ofsimplicity  in the  administration of  the scheme  it is  necessary tocomplicate the  matter by making any differentiation on accountof this sinking  fund as between payers of ecclesiastical  tithe rent-charge on  the  one hand and lay tithe.rentcharge on  the  other inregard to their future annual liability.  110. It should,  however, be recalled that under Section 5 (1) (ii)of the Tithe Act,  1925, it was provided that in certain cases  pay-ments by  the Bounty  into the  sinking fund might be  suspendedtemporarily, and the amount of  the  sinking fund contribution paidto the incumbent of the benefice, subject to the repayment into the sinking  fund during the later years  of  its  operation  of; sumsnecessary to enable it  to reach  the  proper  total.  As the amountof the statutory contribution towards the sinking fund has in suchcases been collected from the  tithe-payers,  the  sum  retained byQueen Anne&apos;s Bounty must be calculated on the basis of the pay-ment and accumulation of the whole of the  sinking fund payments which they have collected from tithe-payers.      Tithe Rentcharge in the same oionership as the land.&apos;  111. The State purchase scheme should not extend to tithe rent-charge which at the date of the publication of our Report was inthe same ownership* as  the land on which it is charged, and werecommend that it should be enacted that all such tithe rentchargeshould be  deemed to have  been merged in  the land and  extin-distinguished as from that date.                     Redemption  Annuities.  112. After deciding what, in our opinion,  should be paid to thetithe-owners as  compensation for extinguishment of their interestsin tithe  rentcharge, it was necessary to consider the amount ofthe  redemption  annuity which  the  tithe-payer  can  properly  becalled upon to pay  annually on  account of  interest  on the moneyadvanced by the State for the purpose of such extinguishment and towards  the provision of a  sinking  fund for replacement of that money.   * In &quot; same ownership &quot; we include cases where the tithe rentcharge is owned by a  person having a limited interest in the  land, e.g., a tenant for life, and con-trariwise cases where the owner of the land or of an estate in the land has a limitedinterest in the tithe rentcharge. Special provision will be needed for such cases.
 113. In the first place as already intimated, we considered thatthe redemption annuity should  not  exceed  the figure  taken  asthe gross annual  value of tithe rentcharge.    It  would, in ouropinion,  be  highly detrimental  to  the  smooth working of thescheme if the tithe-payer&apos;s future annual payment were greater thanthe figure for gross annual value.  In the second place, the periodof the redemption annuity should not be so protracted as to deprive the average tithe-payer of the prospect of some material advantageaccruing to him during his lifetime.  After  careful considerationwe have arrived at the opinion that forty years is the maximum period which will  comply with this condition. 114. An examination  of the balance sheet which emerges if theforegoing recommendations are adopted reveals the fact that after making allowance for remissions and costs of administration, thepayment of redemption annuities of  91 11s. 2d. per  100 titherentcharge (par value) for a period of forty years will not suffice  tomeet  the whole of the interest and sinking fund  charges  necessaryto recoup the State&apos;s capital expenditure.   It is no doubt true thatthe mere fact  that the  redemption annuities are thus insufficientdoes not justify a financial contribution from the State  to enablethe scheme to balance; in the absence of any other material factorthere  would have  been no alternative open to us  but  to modify our proposals by increasing the  annual amount of the  annuities  orextending the period during which they should be payable.   Sucha factor  does,  however, exist in the shape of the contribution  atpresent made by the State towards  the rates on  ecclesiastical titherentcharge.   As a result of this contribution our scheme has hadto provide that the  deduction from the  gross income of ecclesi-astical tithe-owners shall  be less than in  the case of lay tithe-owners, who pay  full  rates on their tithe  rentcharge, as  otherwise the ecclesiastical tithe-owner will receive less  than the fair equiva-lent of his  present  income,  and  his  position  will be  unjustlyprejudiced.   On the other hand it would  in  our  opinion  be unjustto impose different payments upon different classes of tithe-payersaccording to  the ultimate  destination of the tithe rentcharge  pay-able;  all tithe-payers are at present liable to the same payments except for the  contribution  to  a sinking fund  by  the  payer  ofecclesiastical tithe rentcharge and it is just that they should paythe same amounts for liberation from the same burden.  115. Thus the cost of extinguishment of ecclesiastical tithe rent-charge under our  scheme  is increased by the capitalisation of theamount of the  annual burden which the State at present bears  inregard to  rates on  ecclesiastical tithe  rentcharge this  burdenbeing in truth a  liability  of the State which  will be abolished  iftithe  rentcharge is extinguished under our scheme.  We  are  con-fronted here  by a  problem not easy of  solution.  On the  one hand it is  manifestly unjust  to  throw upon  the tithe-payer the  whole burden of  the  abolition of this liability of the  State, and  if the
 practical  difficulty which  has to  be solved was  one in which  the interests  of  the State and  the tithe-payer alone  had to be  con- sidered we should not hesitate to propose that the  State  should contribute to the  extinguishment scheme the full actuarial value of the  annual contribution of  approximately  550,000 which  it  now makes to the relief of the ecclesiastical tithe-owner.   The scheme, however, involves for local  authorities the loss of  a rateable here- ditament at  an earlier date  than that at which the greater  part of tithe rentcharge would disappear under the existing law.   116.   We recognise, though this is not a matter covered  by  our terms of reference, that it is probable that a claim to some allow- ance on this account will be made to the Treasury by certain local authorities, though it is fair to bear in mind that such a loss must and  does occur whenever tithe rentcharge leviable upon land already derated is redeemed and the anomaly of a rate attached to a money payment  is  abolished.   We therefore consider that it is not  un- reasonable that the direct contribution of the Treasury to the scheme for the  extinguishment of  tithe rentcharge should be limited to the amount (which we estimate  at rather less than  400,000)  necessary to bring up the value of the 40 redemption annuities to be paid by landowners now liable to  tithe rentcharge and their successors to the  total sum necessary for  providing for the complete discharge- principal  and interest of  the whole issue  of Government stock.   117. In making this proposal we take into account also the &quot;fact that  the State will have to  bear a  certain increase  of expenditure in the shape  of the costs of collection of the new annuities together with the expenses of the Temporary Commission which is a neces- sary part of the scheme of extinguishment.  As between State and tithe-payer these are factors to which a certain weight may fairly be given.   118. It may not be irrelevant to add that from the tithe-payer&apos;s point of view it is a  fortunate  accident that the  local rates  which fall to be discharged  by the  tithe-owner in virtue of his ownership are not  in the  nature of a  mortgage or charge upon the tithe rent- charge ;  had  local rates  been in  that  position the  tithe-payer would have had to be asked to add to his payments under  a scheme such as ours a  sum for  or towards the compensation of  the local. authorities as owners of a security.  In a matter of this kind it is not- possible  to work out exact figures; a settlement upon broad lines is  the only practical possibility.                      Financial Statement.   119. We are now  in  a  position  to  give the total approximatefigures of the  scheme as  a  whole, prefacing  always  that in  the absence of exact statistical information any such figures must  betreated  as containing an  element  of  estimation  and consequentuncertainty.

In the case  of any rentcharge which became vested in theBounty during the period 1st April, 1927, to 1st April, 1930, the Bounty is liable to contribute one-half only of the rates and the net annual valueof such rentcharge will, therefore, be the same as that of the Welsh Commissioners&apos; benefice tithe rentcharge.  As regards any tithe rentchargeacquired by the Bounty since 1st April, 1930, the Bounty pays full rates on such tithe rentcharge and the net annual value will be similar tothat owned by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and other owners of lay tithe rentcharge.  We are informed that the amount of tithe rentchargewhich has become vested in the Bounty since 1st April, 1927, is negligible and in these circumstances will not, for all practical purposes, affectthe calculations.                                                                                                                                          to

Our Scheme may thus be  summed  up as  follows : Thetithe-payer  will  pay in half-yearly  instalments  at  the   rate  of 91 11s.  2d. per annum  per  100 tithe  rentcharge  (par value) fora  period  of  40 years.   The  tithe-owner  will  receive  a  security which will give him a  net income  of  the highest class  equivalent in value to that which his property, if  valued as we  propose, would produce.     The  State  will for  forty  years  contribute  an  annual   * The figures in Tables B and C do not take into account the mergers referred toin paragraph 111, nor  the effect of the compulsory redemption  or  extinctionof small amounts of  tithe rentcharge  during  the transitional  period referred toin paragraph 154.   These operations will  certainly reduce the amount of  theGovernment Stock to be issued but the existing data do not allow a reliable estimateto be formed  of the amount of reduction.  In any case the general scheme of financewould not be sensibly affected by these operations.   Equally, the balance of the account should not be materially affected should it be decided to deal also with e.vtraordinary rentcharge.  (See  para. 174).  f This is a balance item.  In addition to the actual balance, whatever it majprove to be, the Treasury would incur the costs  of administration of the schemeand of  collecting the annuities, and may also have to deal with the position arising in respect of the loss by rating authorities of tithe rentcharge as a rateable heredita-ment.  It is understood that at the present time local rates on tithe rentchargeamount to  approximately  1,000,000 per annum, and while it  is not within tieprovince of the  Commission to suggest a definite figure, it must be apparent thatour proposals, involving as they do the extinguishment of tithe rentcharge as a rate-able hereditament, will mean  a substantial loss which will have to be made gout of public  resources, central or local.

sum substantially  less than the  amount which under existing legislation it pays in respect of the rates on ecclesiastical tithe rent-cliarge a payment which under the Tithe Act of 1925 was to con-linue for a period of 85 years of which over 70 years still remainmexpired.    The  State  will,  however,  support a  certain  newexpense in the collection of the redemption annuities and in thecost of the Temporary Commission and may have to consider some concession to certain local authorities in respect of the loss of rates.   Redemption  Annuities to be Collected- and  Recovered like                          Income Tax.  121. The person  who  is  to  be  liable for the payment  of  theredemption  annuities  will  normally be  the person  who  is  nowresponsible for the payment of  the tithe  rentcharge in respect ofthe  land affected,  as the  annuities will take  the place of  thetithe rentcharge  and  will  issue  from   the  same  land.    Thisperson  will  be  the  same  as  the  person  who  is  ultimatelyliable  for  Schedule  A  income  tax in  respect of  the land  or would be so liable  if otherwise subject  to income tax.   And  aswe anticipate that the redemption annuities will be collected  bythe  Inland Eevenue Authorities in the same way  as  they collectSchedule A income tax and  land  tax, we suggest that it  shouldbe enacted that these annuities should be payable by the  person who is, or would, if within the scope  of  income tax, be the tax-payer liable for the payment of Schedule A income tax on the land.  122. Having framed our  proposals  on what we hope  will  beregarded as a fair basis so far as the tithe-payer is concerned,  andon terms which  while reasonable  from the point  of view of thetithe-owner are certainly more  favourable to the tithe-payer thanthose existing at  present, we consider that any objection by thetithe-payer to the recovery  of these redemption annuities  by theBoard of Inland  Revenue  in the  same  way and  with  the sameremedies as  income  tax  under  Schedule  A cannot reasonably bejustified.  If Parliament decides to adopt  our proposals  for  theextinguishment of all tithe rentcharge, it follows that it is to theinterest of the  whole  community  that the redemption annuitieswhich become due  and payable should  be easily  recovered.   Inthese circumstances it must be  obvious that in the  event of a con-tumacious refusal to pay a sum  within  the means of the landownerliable, the /State  must and  should  enforce payment as if for a taxin arrear.  The proposals that we  make in the next paragraph forthe remission of any part of the redemption  annuity which exceedsone-third of  the annual value of the  land  affected will meet the generality of what may be called &quot; hard cases.&quot;      Reduction of Redemption Annuities in certain cases.  123. We have already referred in paragraph 32 of this Report tothe provisions  for remission  of  tithe  rentcharge  contained  inSection  8  of the Tithe Act, 1891, whereby the County Court isrequired to remit such amount of  the  tithe rentcharge as exceeds
two-thirds of the annual value of the land as assessed for the pur-pose of Schedule B  income  tax.   The  evidence we have receivedfrom agricultural economists and others has convinced us that theincreased cost to the landowner since 1891 of repairs  and mainten-ance, without a corresponding  increase  in rental value, rendersvery desirable an  alteration of the  fraction of two-thirds in rela-tion  to  the redemption annuities.  124. We are  aware  that  under the Tithe Bill,  1934,  it  was proposed  that tithe  rentcharge should  be remitted if it exceededtwo-fifths  of  the Schedule B  annual  value.    After careful con-sideration  we are  of the opinion  that  in  the case of agricultural land payment of the  full amount of redemption  annuity, to theextent  to  which it  exceeds  one-third  of  the annual  value of theland, will impose an undue burden on the landowner  and is not, in existing conditions, a fair substitution for the burden of tithe andtithe rentcharge; such  a payment must tend to deprive the  land-owner of  an  adequate return on the capital which he has invested in the land,  or, alternatively, it may have the  effect of reducingthe amount which a prudent man would spend  on the  repair andmaintenance  of his property. Where the owner is also the occupier,the non-execution of repair and maintenance work may  only affecthim  personally,  but  where the property is  let the tenant will alsobe the sufferer.  The public interest will, however, suffer in either case.   For these reasons we recommend that in  any case in whichthe annuity in  any  year (taking each  holding or occupation as awhole) exceeds one-third of the Schedule B* value of an agriculturalholding, the excess amount should not be payable or recoverable.  125.  If  our recommendation had  been applicable  to  tithe rent-charge  as  it now  exists, we  should  have pointed  out that themachinery  for obtaining remission under  the Tithe  Act,  1891,  isunnecessarily cumbersome and expensive,  and  that the procedureoutlined in the  Tithe  Bill, 1934, was  preferable,  but inasmuch asthe redemption annuities will be administered and  collected by theBoard of  Inland Bevenue, the whole of the machinery with regardto remission  should work without difficulty.  126.  It  was suggested to  us by witnesses that  remission of theredemption annuities or similar payments might be allowed on the    * Some of our witnesses suggested that remission of tithe rentcharge should bocalculated with reference to the Schedule A value of the land (e.g., Central Land-owners&apos; Association, Question 2500),  or to the net  Schedule A disregarding titherentcharge  (Auctioneers&apos; and Estate Agents&apos; Institute,  Question 2988), whilstothers (e.g., Chartered  Surveyors&apos; Institution, Question 1478, and the national farmers&apos; Union,  Question  1775)  preferred Schedule B  as the measure  for thispurpose. In making our proposals as regards redemption annuities we  considerthat there are obvious advantages in relating the reduction to a basis as regardsannual value which has been adopted over a period of more than 40 years in regardto tithe renteharge and we have,  therefore, based our proposals on Schedule B.
same basis as that on which remissions of land tax are allowed. *It appears to us, however, that such  a concession would not bejustified  and,  further, that it  would  have  no  relation  to  the accepted  basis of remission, namely, the annual value of the landaffected and not  the personal circumstances of the tithepayer.                 Land washed away by the sea.  127. We have heard evidence to the effect that where a partof a tithe area is washed away  by the sea, nevertheless  the full amount of tithe rentcharge remains due. t   We propose that in thecase of land washed away by the sea or destroyed by any naturalcasualty,  an appropriate remission  should  be made in the  redemp-tion annuity, that is  to say, where the whole of an area  liable toan amount of  annuity is  so destroyed, the  whole of that  annuitywill cease to be  recoverable  but  where  part  only  of such  an area is destroyed, the Board of Inland  Revenue should be  required tomake  an  apportionment on an acreage  basis as between the landdestroyed  and the remainder of the land.          Re-apportionment of Redemption Annuities.  128&apos;. It will be necessary, after  the commencement of the scheme,to provide for re-apportionment in the case of a sub-division of the ownership of property  subject to a single payment.   Where partof the land  subject to a particular redemption annuity is sold,  itwill  be  necessary  to assign a separate amount to each  portion,and in some cases (see paragraph  133) we recommend  that im-mediate redemption for cash should take place. We are of opinionthat all necessary apportionments  should be  made by the  Boardof Inland Revenue, who will be responsible for the collection of the annuities.  129. In the case of agricultural land the apportionment should bemade in proportion to the Schedule B value of the various  portions of the land concerned.  This  will ensure that the annuities  willcontinue  to bear relation to the Schedule B valuation a point which is  essential, having regard to our proposals with regard toremission.  130. In the  case  of non-agricultural land, we consider  that the apportionment might, for the convenience of  all  parties,  be madeon an area basis, as this is the usual method by which a purchaserof non-agricultural land estimates his prospective  liability to sucha charge.  131.  Particulars of all re-apportionments  should be  recorded bythe  local  officer  of the  Board of Inland Revenue,  in order that acomplete  record may be available of the amount of annuity charged   * e.g. see Minutes of Evidence, 19th Day, page 574, para. 11 (2).  An ownerwhose property is liable to land tax is entitled to total exemption from the tax if his total income from all  sources does not exceed   160 a year.  If such incomeexceeds  160 but does not exceed  400 he  is entitled to an abatement of half theamount of the tax.   f Minutes of Evidence, 1st Day, page 5, para. 32 (6) and 4th Day, page 96,Questions 1212-1215.
on each separately owned piece of land in his district liable to the annuities;  this record should be available to persons interested for reference.                       Disclosure on sale.  132. We have  received not  a little  evidence tending  to  showthat  purchasers  of  land are  not  always  made   aware  of  theexistence  of tithe  rentcharge and that the fact that  the land  isconveyed free of incumbrances (in which term, as already noticed,*tithe  rentcharge is not legally included)  creates a wrong impression in the mind of a layman, t  In any case, we consider that there aregreat advantages  in ensuring that a prospective purchaser shouldbe made aware of the  liability.   We accordingly recommend thatit should be enacted that on any sale of  land the  vendor shall berequired to disclose to the  purchaser the  amount of  redemptionannuity, if any, payable in respect of the land being sold.  Arrange-ments should be made for the appropriate local officer of the Boardof Inland Revenue for  the district to furnish to interested parties,on request, information as regards redemption annuities.                    Redemption of Annuities.  133. It should  be open to a landowner, at any time, to redeemfor cash the whole or a portion of any redemption  annuity charged on his land.  It should also be provided that on sale of  part of aproperty subject to a redemption annuity it should be compulsoryon the vendor, before the sale is completed, to notify the Board of inland Bevenue so that an apportionment of the redemption annuityas between vendor and  purchaser can be made, and that where theamount of land   being  sold is  such that  on  apportionment theredemption annuity thereon would not  amount  to  more than 20s,per annum, it should be  compulsory  on the vendor to redeem theredemption annuity on that part of the  land  on or before thecompletion  of  the sale.   Similarly, where the part of the landretained would be liable to so small  a  redemption annuity the vendor should be required to redeem  within some short  fixed period after  the  sale.  The consideration for  the redemption  should, inall cases,  be the  present  value,  at the time of the redemption, ofthe future instalments of  the relevant annuity.  134. Moreover,  it is  obviously  desirable that  where land is soldfor building or development,  including the construction  of roadsby  a  local  or central authority,  the  redemption annuity should be redeemed  for  cash.   It  is  true that  if  our  recommendation is adopted as regards the apportionment of  the liability for the pay-ment of redemption annuities the difficulties which have  occurred in the past as regards collection of tithe  rentcharge,  owing to  alarge number of  individual  owners  becoming liable for  the tithe   *  See paragraph. 28.   f  e.g. Minutes of Evidence, 1st Day, page 17, Question 29, page 23, Questions126-130, 5th Day, page 111, Question 1563, and 9th Day, page 225, Questions3102-3107.
rentcharge, may not arise to  so great an extent in the future, yetwe consider that the development of agricultural land for other purposes  provides  a convenient opportunity  of  freeing  the land from its liability and that redemption should be compulsory on sucha sale.  135. We would  recommend  that in any amending  legislationprovision  should be made to  ensure that  the procedure which  we propose should be carried out.                         PART  III.                 PROVISIONS FOE. TRANSITION.           Establishment of Temporary  Commission.  136. It is our considered opinion that the collection and recovery of the new redemption  annuities is a matter which will properlycome within the scope of the Board  of Inland Revenue, who ai*eresponsible for  the collection of taxes to  which the  redemptionannuities  will have an analogy.  At  the  same time we  recognisethat before that Department  can take over the collection of theseannuities  it will have to  be  settled what the landowners affectedmust,  individually,  pay.   It  follows that there must  be a transi-tional period for the establishment  of the new system.   Similarly though this need not delay the transfer to  the Inland  Revenue  ofthe power  to collect the  annuities it will be necessary to settle the amount of the stock which, by way of compensation, each tithe-owner has  to receive.  137. There would, in our opinion,  be obvious  advantages if thesettlement  of  these points could  be entrusted  to a  TemporaryCommission as an independent body appointed for  the purpose and given  considerable  discretionary  powers  for the  purpose  of bringing  the  new  system into working order.   The commission should take over from the Ministry  of Agriculture and  fisheries the existing documents and records of that  Department in connec-tion with tithe  rentcharge, and we apprehend that the desirabilityof utilising the services of the  Ministry&apos;s staff and  other qualifiedpersons who have had experience of the very technical work arising under the Tithe Acts will not be disregarded.  138. It  will  also be necessary to enact  that the present tithe-owners should  be  under  an  obligation to supply the commission with the  originals, or duly authenticated copies,  of their  collection lists, indicating the tithe areas in respect  of which payment hasbeen claimed in respect of each tithe-payer named in the list, and generally to&apos; supply all  such other documents and all such informa- tion  in  their  possession or  power  as may be  required  by the Commission.  139.  The decision of the Commission  as to all matters  within the scope of their  authority, including in  particular the amounts of compensation receivable by tithe-owners and of the redemption
annuities payable  by  landowners,;  should be  binding upon  allpersons interested, subject.to a right of appeal to the High Courtwhen any question of law is involved.  140. It may prove desirable to have the Commission constituted in divisions,  each division dealing with a separate branch of workand having in relation thereto final power of decision subject to thegeneral principles of the Act of Parliament as to appeal.          Tithe-owners to submit claims and prove title.  141. The tithe apportionments and other documents relating tothe commutation of tithe into tithe rentcharge which  are  now inthe custody  of the  Ministry, contain  information  only as to the ownership of the tithe rentcharge at the time of commutation in1836  or  soon  afterwards.    Since  that date  parcels  of  titherentcharge  have  changed  hands  by   sale  or  otherwise;  insuch  cases  and  also  where  the  present owners  have acquiredtheir  title  by  inheritance from  the  original owners.  of  thetithe  rentcharge, there  is no  complete  official record  in exist-ence  of the  present  ownership.    It will, therefore,  be essential for  the  purposes  of  the  extinguishment  scheme that   persons or  bodies  claiming compensation under the  scheme  as  owners of  tithe rentcharge should  submit  to  the  Commission  detailsof the tithe rentcharge which they claim  to be in their ownership and of the title under which such tithe rentcharge is held.    Suchclaims might be made in  the form of a statutory declaration of titlein. accordance with  the  present  practice under  the  Tithe  Acts inconnection with redemption of tithe rentcharge.  142. As in certain cases it has  already been established that titherentcharge has  become  irrecoverable under  the  Peal  PropertyLimitation Acts, it  will  be necessary  also to  require tithe-owners to prove that the tithe rentcharge in respect of which compensationis claimed has  not  become statute-barred.  143. In view of the suggestion made in paragraph 111 as to the compulsory extinguishment by merger of tithe rentcharge on landsowned  by  the owner  of the tithe rentcharge, it will  also  bedesirable that the claims for compensation should  state whether,and if so to  what extent, any of the  lands subject to tithe rent-charge are, or have at any material time been, in the ownership ofthe claimant.  144. Under the existing law,  on the merger of tithe rentchargein the land  affected, any charge, incumbrance or liability whichlawfully exists  on  such  tithe rentcharge before  such  mergerbecomes a charge on that land.   We understand that  this is notlegally the case where tithe rentcharge is  redeemed under the pro-visions  of the  Tithe Acts.  In  any case, we  think  it  would be highly inconvenient  that  any incumbrances or charges on the tithe
rentcharge should become charges on the land under  the schemewe propose for extinguishment of all  tithe rentcharge.   We would propose,  therefore, that the  statutory declaration to be  made  bythe  tithe-owner   as  evidence  of  his title  to  the  tithe  rent-charge, should  also  show whether  the  tithe  rentcharges  dealtwith  therein are,  or  are   not,  subject  to  incumbrances.   Ifsubject to incumbrances, their nature  should be set out, and follow -ing the  existing  precedent  as regards  redemption  money  underthe Tithe Acts,  the  temporary  Commission  should be  entrusted with the  duty of deciding whether  the  incumbrancers should  be protected, and of ordering that  in  a proper  case  the  necessaryamount of the compensation  for extinguishment  should be appliedto the  redemption of  their rights. 145.  It should  be  provided that tithe-owners  should  file  their claims  for compensation within a  strictly limited period after thepassing of any relevant legislation, and  failure to submit a  claimwithin the statutory period  should  involve loss of any right  to compensation. 146.  While it is true that the original Tithe Apportionments  inthe custody of the Ministry have  been annotated to show all the changes which have  been  made  by redemptions, mergers and re-apportionments conducted  through the Ministry  up  to  the presentdate, the documents do not indicate cases where tithe rentcharge hasbeen merged  or redeemed  informally  by  arrangement between thetithe-owner and the tithe-payer; apart from this, a very  consider-able revision of these  documents would be necessitated as a result ofthe further re-apportionments and redemptions which  on our pro-posals  should be carried out as a preliminary to the  transfer to theBoard  of Inland Revenue of the duty of recovering the redemptionannuities. 147.  Moreover,  we gather  from the evidence  we have received that there is not in existence  a complete up-to-date set of collectionlists  for  tithe rentcharge  so  as  to allow such lists  readily  to  beadopted  for   the  purposes   of   the  collection  of  redemptionannuities.  This  is doubtless due  in part to the fact that  tithe-owners at present have the right  to  recover the whole of a  rent-charge from  the owner  of  part  only  of  the  land  liable andhave   not,  therefore,  been   under  any  necessity  to  keep   acomplete  record  of  ownerships.    There  is  also  reason   tobelieve that   in   some  cases the  lists  on  which  collection  is effected  are,  in  fact,  inaccurate  and   do  not  invariably   setout the numbers of the tithe areas  in respect of which the titherentcharge is payable.  It was stated by tithe-owners in evidence*that they had already  found it  necessary to expend considerablesums in connection with surveys for the purpose of compiling andrevising collection lists, and  it would  seem doubtful whether this  * e.g. Minutes of Evidence,  14th Day, page 382, para. 10, and 16th Day, page459, para. 11.
revision is, in all cases, complete.    Tithe-owners have also com-&apos;plainecl* in evidence that under the present  law they are only ableto recover two years arrears of tithe rentcharge in  cases where theyhave had  to  refund as much  as six years rentcharge to a  person&quot;who had been called upon to pay in error.  This complaint suggeststhat collection in a number of cases has been made from personswho were not liable, and it may be inferred  that to this extent  thetithe-owners&apos; collection lists are not, in  all&apos;cases,  accurate.   148.  The   Temporary  Commission will  find  it  essential,  for determing  the  liability of  landowners for the  payment  of  theredemption   annuities,  to  investigate  the   relevant  tithe  mapswhich,  as  we have already explained, constitute the means of iden-tifying  the property subject to tithe rentcharget.  These maps are,however, very old,  and in addition  it seems clear from Section 1 ofthe Tithe  Act, 1837, that even at the date of their preparation theyvaried  in  accuracy.  In  fact  that  Section  empowered  the  TitheCommissioners to confirm the Tithe Apportionment for a particulardistrict even if they were not satisfied as to the accuracy of the map,and in  such  cases the Act provided that  instead of sealing the mapor plan the Commissioners should merely certify under their handsthat it was the map or plan referred to in the apportionment.  Weunderstand that as a matter  of fact only 1,902  Tithe Maps  aresealed out of  a total of 11,787.   149.  Arrangements should be made for the Parish Copies of  theexisting Tithe  Maps  and Instruments  of  Apportionment  or Be-apportionment to be handed over to the local officer of the Board of inland  Eevenue for the district.  The original documents at pre-sent in the custody of the  Ministry will be required  by  the Tern-porary  Commission, but  after  the transitional  work has beencompleted we hope that, having regard to their historical interestand importance, suitable arrangements  will  be  made by  H.M.Eecord  Office for  their preservation either  centrally or  in  the counties concerned.   Re-apportionments and Redemptions during transitional period.   150.  Another  necessary piece of  work appropriate  to  the Tern-porary  Commission is that of bringing re-apportionment up to date.If the  redemption  annuities  fall to  be  collected by the  Board of inland Eevenue, it will be essential in order to avoid  excessive    * e.g., Minutes of  Evidence, 14th Day, page 395,  para. 40, and 16th Day,page 465, para.  6.    &quot;j&quot; See para. 17.  In this connection we understand that in some cases the parish copy of  the tithe map is not in proper custody, while in other cases mapshave become so damaged or defaced as to render identification difficult, if not impossible.  We have satisfied ourselves by inspection that all possible steps havebeen taken by the Ministry to preserve the original Tithe Apportionments and mapswhich are in its  custody, and we are glad to say that during the past twenty years the Ministry has taken  special steps to restore the original tithe maps which had become damaged by handling for the purpose of reference by the public and othersover a long period of years.
costs and difficulties in collection that the amount of  redemptionannuity payable by  each landowner concerned should  be separatelyassessed  before the  commencement of the collection.   We under-stand that owing to a variety  of  reasons the excessive cost ofobtaining legal altered apportionments was  put forward by somewitnesses and in  other  cases the existence of  arrangements for thecollection  of  tithe  rentcharge  on  informal  apportionments it often  happens that the  lands  comprising  a  tithe  area aresub-divided  in ownership,  but the  tithe  rentcharge  has  not beenlegally re-apportioned by the Ministry between the various owners*.As regards the tithe rentcharge owned by Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty,the  Ecclesiastical Commissioners and the Welsh  Commissioners,figures which those bodies have been good enough to supply indicatethat  as regards approximately 80,000 tithe areas the  annual titherentcharge is being  collected  on the basis of informal apportion-ments, while in 20,000 cases  the whole tithe rentcharge is  beingcollected  from a person who owns part only of the land liable.  all such cases should be dealt with, if possible, before the collection ofthe  relevant  redemption  annuities  is  transferred to the  InlandRevenue  authorities.   We recommend,  therefore, that these re-apportionments should  be carried out with the minimum  delay bythe  Temporary  Commission,  who  should be  entrusted  with  thefullest discretionary  powers, the somewhat elaborate procedure laiddown by  the  Tithe Acts for  the re-apportionment of tithe rentchargebeing simplified as  far as  possible  in order  to expedite the com-pletion of the work.  The  apportionments should, we suggest, beeffected on the basis of  area in respect of non-agricultural land, andon the basis of the Schedule B  value in the case of agricultural land.Any  apportioned amounts of tithe rentcharge of 20s. or less, result-ing from such re-apportionments, should be immediately redeemedby a cash payment  upon the terms  and conditions mentioned inparagraphs 154 to 157.  151. The  foregoing  does not  exhaust the  duties which in ouropinion may  reasonably be  confided to the Temporary  Commission.As long  ago  as 1878 Parliament enacted that wherever land hadbeen  charged with any rentcharge not exceeding 20s.  such rent-charge should, on the application of the landowner or tithe-owner,and  in   the  discretion  of the  Tithe  Commissioners   (now  theMinistry) be  redeemed  compulsorily as against the tithe-owner orlandowner, t  152. From information obtained from Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty, the ecclesiatical Commissioners  and  the Welsh  Commissioners  itappears  that  as  regards a total amount  of tithe rentcharge of  * It should, of course, be realised that the Ministry has no power under theBasting law to make re-apportionments except on the specific application of one ofoi the tithe-payers concerned,  or, in the exceptional case  of a consolidation ofaltered apportionments, the  tithe-owner (see Minutes of Evidence, 1st Day, page. para. 44).  t See para.  50.
  2,576,632 (par value) owned by those bodies,  some 133,840&apos; land- owners are paying tithe  rentcharge of an annual par value of 10s. or less,  of which some 21,121 pay  Is. or less per annum.  It is clear, therefore, that full effect has not been given to the intentions of Parliament in regard  to redemption of small tithe rentcharges, and we  consider that in  the  absence of very special reasons to the contrary such as undue hardship to an individual landowner in very poor  circumstances there should be an immediate compulsory redemption by a cash payment of all rentcharges of 20s. or less where the burden of any tithe-payer in respect of tithe rentcharge does not exceed that amount.   153. The Tithe Act, 1878, also provided  for  redemption of tithe rentcharge without limit of  amount where land had been  taken for certain public purposes and  also  where land had been so sub- divided in ownership for building or other purposes that a further apportionment  of the tithe  rentcharge  could not  conveniently be  made.   The  Tithe  Act, 1925,  extended  redemption in  the latter class of case  to land  about  to be  so  sub-divided.   Here again full effect has not been  given to the intentions of Parliament^ and   in  these cases  also we recommend  immediate  compulsory redemption.  154. The Temporary Commission should be charged with  the enforcement of redemption in all these cases.   The consideration for redemption should be based On the capitalised net annual value of the tithe rentcharge arrived  at on the  basis  set out  in  para- graphs 85 to  108 of this Report.   Moreover, compulsory redemp- tion on  these lines should, in our opinion,  be extended to include tithe rentcharge charged on  land acquired by local authorities for any  purpose.  155. We understand that  there are many cases where  a  small tithe rentcharge is charged upon an area which has now become fully developed as urban  property, and the ownership of the whole or part of  the land concerned is divided between a large number of persons.   It is possible that in such cases the cost of apportioning and   collecting  the  redemption  money  would  result  in  separate assessments  of  a few pence only;  in the  interests of public administration we consider that in any amending legislation which may be  introduced as a result of our Report it should  be  provided that  the Temporary  Commission should  have a discretion, subject if necessary to Treasury  approval, to certify that having regard to the  excessive  cost of redemption proceedings the whole or part of such tithe  rentcharges be. extinguished without compensation to the  present tithe-owners, such certificate  to be  conclusive  evidence of extinction  but not so as to exclude other  modes of proof in  the absence  of the certificate.   * The reasons for the failure to  give full effect to these provisions are discussed in paragraphs 55 to 57 of this Report.
  156. The Temporary  Commission  will probably need additional remedies for the recovery of the consideration  money for redemp- tion where that course is compulsory ; these remedies  should include aright of personal action against the landowner and the right of a mortgagee to a sale.  157. As  a further means of facilitating  the re-apportionments and redemptions to which we have referred, and as the proceedings will result in a saving in the cost of subsequent administration  by lire Board of Inland Revenue,  we suggest that  no fees or expenses should be charged to the landowners, whose liability to the State in the  case of redemption should be limited to  the amount  of  the redemption money, the  proceedings to  be regarded  as a  public service.            Procedure of Temporary Commission.  158. It may be useful if, without attempting to lay down any hard and fast rules, we indicate how, in our opinion, the operations of the transitional period will be carried through  and the work of the Tem- porary Commission brought to  an end.  This work will have three aspects:       (a) in relation to the tithe-payer the Commission will have   the task of determining the redemption annuities payable and   the area out of.which each annuity will issue; this will mean a   considerable amount of  re-apportionment.   The  Commission   will  also have to  settle in what cases redemption is  to  be   enforced and in what cases small amounts may be cancelled ;      (b) in relation to the tithe-owner the Commission will have   the task of  determining the amount of compensation which each   tithe-owner will be entitled to receive;      (c)  in  relation to the  Inland Revenue authorities and the   Treasury the Commission  will  be charged  with the duty of   collecting sums  paid  on account of  the redemption annuities   pending the final settlement of  individual  amounts.  It will   transfer to the Inland Revenue authorities the duty of collect-   ing the redemption annuities as and when the relevant amounts   and areas are definitely settled.   It will also certify the amount   of stock  to be issued to former tithe-owners by way of com-   pensation. We  suggest  that the following  might  be the general lines onwhich  the Commission would do its work. (1) As  from the appointed day to be fixed as already indicated*at as early a date  as practicable after the passing of the necessary legislation the  new redemption annuities  will  take  the place of the rentcharge.   These annuities should provisionally and duringthe period  of transition be collected by and payable to the  Tem-porary  Commission, who will be responsible for their transmission* See para. 71.
to the Inland Revenue authorities.   The  Commission should havethe same powers of  recovery  as those proposed  for  the InlandEevenue.   Should it prove impossible completely to carry throughthe necessary administrative arrangements for the establishmentof the redemption annuities at an early  date, we urge that the rateof tithe rentcharge  should as soon  as possible be  reduced to  &apos;9111s. 2d.  per  100  (par value),  and that  any such reduced  titherentcharge should be collected by the Temporary Commission and(except in those  cases  in which the  tithe  rentcharge  is  to  be redeemed see paragraph  154), treated as equivalent pro tanto tothe redemption  annuities for all purposes  of our Eeport  includingfreedom from local rates.   (2)  The Temporary  Commission  should  with   all  reasonabledespatch  determine  the  amounts  of  the  redemption  annuitiesand  the   areas  chargeable  therewith;   as   and  when   theseparticulars  are  settled  for  the greater  part of the  annuitiesin  a   particular parish,  rural  district or  county  (as  may  befound most   convenient)   the   Commission  will  transfer  themto  the  local  Inland Eevenue  authorities   for  collection  and management.   The  settlement  should   not  in the   majorityof  cases  involve any  great difficulty  as the   figures will  bebased, by scaling down,  on the amount  of tithe rentcharge actuallypayable and  the annual  value or area of land liable thereto.  TheCommission, as already  explained, will be entitled to demand and receive from  tithe-owners  (and also when necessary  from  tithe-payers) all documents, maps  and information in their possession orpower, so as  to render possible  the  discharge of this task.   Thechief   difficulties  will probably  arise  when  re-apportionment isnecessary;  in  those cases  transfers  to the  Inland  Eevenueauthorities will  be delayed, but the delay need not affect transferswhere difficulties do not  occur or have been disposed of.   Similarly,the disposal of  the question of redemption and of  the  cancellation of  small  amounts may  take a  certain time, but  this should notdelay  the transfer of the great  bulk of the new  annuities to the inland Eevenue authorities.    Where it is  not   possible  by theappointed day to determine exactly the amount of the redemptionannuity payable by  an individual tithe-payer any payment made byhim  in respect  of any  period after the  appointed day  should be credited to him against his liability for  his redemption annuity.The   tithe-owner   will  receive  compensation  in  GovernmentStock which will  carry  interest  as  from  the  appointed day,even  in cases  where it is  not  possible  to  determine  the  exactamount  of  his  compensation on or before that day.  As  regardsthe case  of  the tithe-payer  whose property  is subject to a titherentcharge not  exceeding 20s. per annum and as such  should be redeemed (subject to exceptions in hard cases)  we apprehend that where the redemption money  is fixed before the appointed day,even  if it is  not paid until later, the tithe rentcharge will cease to exist  on  the  appointed  day  and the  redemption money  if unpaid
should  carry  interest at,  say, 4 per  cent,  from  that  day.  Theredemption money and  interest will be  the  property of the tithe-owner,  who will therefore receive no compensation in the shape ofgovernment Stock in respect  of such  tithe rentcharge.   Where itis not  administratively  possible to fix the  redemption  money  insuch a case before the appointed day owing to apportionment being necessary or for other reasons, the tithe-payer should  pay, or  bedebited, at the rate of  91 11s. 2d. per  100 tithe rentcharge (parvalue) as from the appointed day until the date when the redemp-tion money is fixed.  Such payments  will be accounted for to thetithe-owner by  the  Temporary Commission subject to deduction[or cost of collection, the  tithe-owner  remaining liable for local rates and land  tax  on such  payments.   Prom the date  the  re-redemption money is fixed the procedure would follow that indicated above.  (3) Side by side with the work  above referred  to, but possibly by means of  a separate department,  the Temporary  commission will have to determine the amount  of  stock to be issued by  way ofcompensation to the  former tithe-owner.   This will involve separatecalculations based  on the amounts paid by  or for tithe-owners inrespect of local  rates and  land tax; provision will also  have to  bemade for dealing with any liability to chancel repairs,* and withincumbrances on the tithe rentcharge. t  It should, however,  befound possible to certify at an early date issues of stock in manycases to tithe-owners based on the minimum amounts  allowable,leaving over for settlement the exact determination of final figures.  In all cases,  it may be  repeated, stock issued  will carry interest at from the appointed day, any arrears of interest up to the date of issue being paid in cash.  (4) The  Temporary  Commission will  account  to the  InlandRevenue authorities  for  all receipts  by  way of  the  redemptionannuities.  This will be a  continuous process at prescribed intervalsduring  the existence of the Commission.   Capital  sums paid  onredemption of small  amounts  during the transitional period  will be accounted for directly to the tithe-owner.  (5) When  all the  redemption annuities  have  been  fixed andtransferred to the  Inland Revenue authorities for future manage-ment and all receipts accounted for,  the  Commission will  be dis-solved.                Justification for  appointment.  159.  We anticipate that there will be a general  recognition thatthese duties could not be  discharged in any other way than by theappointment of  a temporary Commission with the requisite powers.  160.  Over a period of nearly 100 years the State has taken  nos&apos;eps (except as  regards  the  carrying out  of re-apportionments,         * See para. 106.30944f See para. 144.C
redemptions,  etc.  when  applications  have  been  made  to theGovernment Department  concerned) to  exercise any supervision over the administration of the collection  from between three and four hundred  thousand persons of varying  amounts of tithe rentcharge created by  Act of Parliament and  amounting on  presentfigures to over  3 million per annum. From what has  already been stated in this  Report,  it is clear that inconvenience in some casesamounting to minor injustice has been and  is being caused tonumber of property owners  owing to the difficulty of  ascertainingtheir precise liability to tithe rentcharge and  of ensuring that any demand made upon them for tithe  rentcharge  is for  the amountproperly attributable to their land.   Even if a landowners property is subject to a legally apportioned tithe rentcharge, it is only by  inspection of a map, usually  80 or 90  years  old, which doenot necessarily show the present-day property boundaries, that hecan  ascertain  the exact liability of his land.  As  regards informalapportionments,  the landowner has no effectual  means of ensuring that he is  being called upon to pay his proper share  of  the titherentcharge.  Moreover,  as already stated*,  a  property owner maybe  called  upon  to pay tithe rentcharge attributable to  land ofwhich he owns a portion only, and it is difficult and in  fact, withoutconsiderable expense,  impossible, for him to  ascertain preciselywdiat other properties are liable jointly with  his  property  so thathe  may  exercise his  right  to recover  contributions  towards thetithe rentcharge  he has paid; even if he  is successful  in  his effortthe  expense  of  legal  proceedings  to recover such contributionsalmost invariably deters the owner  from taking  action, althouglthe sense of grievance remains.  161. In  relation  to  such matters affecting so  large  a number ofmembers of the  community we consider that  the  State has  a duty to perform in the national  interest and at  the expense of thenation.                           PART IV.                        MISCELLANEOUS.                 Arrears of Tithe  Rentcharge.  162. From  the evidence we have received it seems  clear that atthe  date of the  commencement  of the scheme  which we proposefor the extinguishment of all tithe  rentcharge, a certain  amounlof tithe  rentcharge legally  due  and recoverable  by  the  existingtithe-owners will be in arrear.  We would make  a strong  appeal to tithe-owners and tithe-payersalike to facilitate the administration  of the extinguishment schemeand to  enable it to be put  into operation without friction.would urge tithe-owners that they should  consider very carefullywhether they would  be well advised to press to the  uttermost inall  cases their legal rights in regard to  arrears of  tithe rentcharge,* See para. 59 (7).
and we  would  impress upon tithe-payers  that  only a  completeabsence of the means of payment can, in the new conditions, afford a justification for a  refusal to discharge their, land from. a legal obligation.            Refunding of payments made in error.  163. As already mentioned,* our attention has  been called to thefact that  under  the existing law,  where tithe  rentcharge  has been paid to the rentcharge owner in mistake of fact by a person who isnot the owner of any portion of the land subject thereto, the payermay recover from the rentcharge owner the amount  so paid for thepast six  years,  although  owing to the  limitation imposed by theTithe  Act, 1891, the tithe-owner cannot recover more than twoyears arrears from the land  actually  chargeable.  164. Had we  contemplated the continuance of tithe rentcharge,we should have been inclined to  have  recommended that in sucha case the tithe-owner should foe empowered  to  recover  from theland actually  chargeable  any  amount  which  he was required torefund, but we  apprehend  that  the anomaly to which  we have referred will not arise in future in connection  with the redemptionannuities.  As to the past,  the matter  seems hardly of.  sufficient importance to require special legislation.    Redemptions already  effected under Section 4  (2) of the                       Tithe Act,  1918  165. Some of our  witnesses!  called  our attention  to  the caseswhere advantage had been taken of the provisions of Section 4 (2)of the Tithe Act of  1918, which enabled tithe  rentcharge to be redeemed either by   agreement between the  tithe-owner  and thelandowner or, in the  absence of such agreement, on the applicationof the landowner if made within a limited period, the considerationmoney for the redemption being discharged by an annuity payableeither yearly  or half-yearly for a period not exceeding  50  years (extended by  Section 20  (1) of the Tithe Act, 1925, to 60 years).We are informed that in the majority  of cases where redemptionhas been  effected under these provisions the period of the annuityhas been fixed  at the statutory  maximum.i   We  have carefully considered whether any recommendation should be made in respect of these  cases, but as in each instance  redemption was effected on terms agreed between the  landowner and  the tithe-owner  or, alternatively, the proceedings were initiated by the  landowner, we do not think that it  is either necessary or desirable to reopen and amend the terms of the bargains  into which  these landowners voluntarily entered.   The recommendations which we make in this   * See para. 147.   t e.g., Minutes of Evidence, 1st Day, page 9, paras. 57 and 58, 8th Day, page &quot;8, para.  12 and 10th Day, page 245, para.  23.   t Minutes of Evidence, 1st Day, page 9, para. 58.   30944                                                    0 2
* See Minutes of Evidence, 14th Day, page 403, Question 4940.Keport as regards tithe rentcharge  are  thus  not intended to  apply in any way to the payments which are being  made in respect ofthe redemption of tithe rentcharge under the Act of 1918.                  Contingent tithe  rentcharges.  166.  We understand that in a few isolated districts certain titherentcharges exist which have  special  attributes not common  totithe  rentcharge  in general.  In  some  cases such  rentcharges  are payable only  every  alternate year  or  every  three  years,  whilstin other cases they are payable to different tithe-owners in differentyears.  In-dealing with  these tithe rentcharges under  the extin-guishment scheme it  will be necessary to make  slight modifications in the general  procedure in accordance  with  the nature of  theparticular tithe rentcharge.         Corn Bents  and other payments  in  lieu of tithe.  167.  &quot; Corn rent &quot; is a term  which is usually applied to anyrentcharge or money  payment payable under any local or personalAct or Award in lieu of tithe.   Corn  rents do not come withinthe statutory  definition  of  tithe  rentcharge,  and consequently  are outside our terms of  reference,  although in many cases  they  arevested in Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty and so  some of our witnesses have called our attention to their existence.  168.  The liability of corn rents to local rates and  the  mode of recovery depend upon the terms of the local Acts under which theywere  created.  We were informed  by Queen Anne&apos;s  Bounty thatas regards 508  parishes  in  which they owned corn rents incases  the corn  rents are not subject to rates*, but we are  not!certain that  this  high proportion will  necessarily apply to cornjrents  in other  ownership.   Corn rents  are  usually  variablestated periods and on  certain conditions, having regard to  the price jof corn.  169.  Bentcharges are  also payable in  respect of the tithes  onlgated  or stinted pasture.   These rentcharges were excluded from Ithe operation of  the Tithe Act of  1891 which  transferredliability to tithe rentcharge to the landowner,  and the rentchargeslconsequently remain payable by the persons who are liable to ratesjin respect of the property.  170.  In addition, sums or rates in lieu of tithe are in  some casesjpayable for each head of cattle or stock turned out on land subto rights of common or held or enjoyed  in common.  171. Should our general  scheme for the extinguishment of tithegrentcharge be taken  into consideration, it will no doubt also  &apos;considered how  far it is desirable to include in it the extinction!of corn rents  and any other payments in lieu of tithes.
J                   Extraordinary Rentcharge.i\  172.  During the  course of our evidence  a number of witnesses I made   reference  to   the   extraordinary   rentcharge  to  which I certain  land,  mainly in  Kent,  is  liable under  the operation I of the Extraordinary  Tithe Redemption Act, 1886.  That Act wasel passed for the purpose of converting the fluctuating extraordinaryol tithe rentcharge on  hops, fruit and market gardens into  a fixed andel permanent rentcharge not liable to  variation,  by ascertaining andtj charging on  each  farm the  capital  value of  the  extraordinarytj charge  payable in respect of such farm at  the date of the passing-I of the Act (25th June, 1886); it being provided that, until redemp-sj tion at the capital  value fixed,  the  lands should be charged  with3] j rentcharge of  4 per cent, on  such capital value.  The general I result of the Act was to fix the capital  value of  the charge at I 1518,343 10s. Od.  with resulting annual  4 per cent, rentcharges I amounting to  20,741 14s. 5d.  Since that date and up to the endm of 1934 rentcharges  amounting to   2,290&apos; 10s.  lid.  have  beenif redeemed, leaving rentcharges of  18,451 3s. 6d. still payable.  OfJ this amount  17,532  is vested in Queen Anne&apos;s  Bounty.*\  173.  Although  this  extraordinary  rentcharge  is  not,   strictly i speaking, tithe rentcharge and  consequently does not  fall withinsj our terms of reference, it is a payment in lieu of tithe,  and we did I not think it desirable to exclude any evidence which was profferedf to us concerning it; for convenience  we have  included  in thej- Appendices to our Minutes of Evidence a short note on the subjectm of the provisions  of the Act  of 1886  and its effect.1  174.  We are of the opinion that in connection with  the  scheme we have recommended for the extinguishment of tithe  rentcharge,  steps might  reasonably be  taken to bring within  its scope this  4 per cent,  rentcharge, liability to which is  the cause of  somee;. misunderstanding  and considerable discontent.  The  rentcharge I possesses, apart  from  cost of  collection,  however,  none  of theJ attributes of tithe  rentcharge which we  have  necessarily  had toij take into account  in  arriving  at  the  net annual  value.  this; extraordinary rentcharge  is not  subject to any parochial, county,si or  other rate, charge, or  assessment, or to  land tax,  and, ins: addition to  the  remedies  for  recovery  which tithe  rentcharge ; enjoyed prior to  the  Tithe  Act, 1891,  it is recoverable by action I or  by entry  upon  and perception of the rents  and profits of theJ  land.

(11) The  detailed  work necessary to the  establishment of thescheme of extinguishment to be entrusted to a Temporary Corn-mission, subject to the control of the High Court on points of law.(Paragraphs 72, 136 and 137.)                         CONCLUSION.  Our effort has been to put an end to a secular controversy whichhas had regrettable social consequences, by a  scheme for the total abolition of tithe  rentcharge  upon terms  of  substantial justice toall interests involved.  The scheme which we propose reduces thepayments of tithe  rentcharge to what we consider  to be the annualamount at which  they might properly be stabilised  and  convertsthose payments into  redemption annuities payable for forty yearsonly  and  sufficient,  with  the  aid  of a  contribution  from  theTreasury  of  substantially less  than  the- amount now  paid  outof public  funds for the benefit  of tithe-owners,  to redeem in thatperiod the necessary Government loan.   At  the same time  thescheme secures to tithe-owners the fair value of their property  and-a point of considerable practical importance puts an end to the anomalies and inconveniences  of small and irregular apportionmentsof tithe rentcharge.  We. put forward this scheme as a  whole; the parts of it aremutually interdependent; it is as a whole that it  must be judged.  We cannot close  our Report without  acknowledging  the  debtwhich we owe to our Secretary, Mr. E. L. Mitchell, C.B.E.,  andour Assistant  Secretary, Mr.  A. S. Allen, for assistance of whichit would be difficult  to exaggerate the  value.   Mr. Mitchell in his official capacity is charged with the responsibility of such dutiesof the Ministry as relate to tithe  rentcharge and Mr. Allen is amember of the  Tithe Branch of  the same Department of State.Mr.  Mitchell&apos;s long practical experience of the administration ofthe Tithe Acts and his intimate knowledge of all the many prob-lems connected with tithe rentcharge have  been placed unreservedlyat our service;  our  task  has also  been greatly  facilitated  by the accuracy and devotion which Mr. Allen has unsparingly contributed to our work. The Commissioners have to record with deep sorrow the death,on the 26th September, 1935, of their colleague, Lord Cornwallis;  30944                                                   0 4
his intimate knowledge of agricultural conditions and his high sense of public duty were of  inestimable  value  to the deliberations ofthe Commission.  At  the last meeting of  the Commission before his  death LordCornwallis expressed  complete  concurrence with the  text  of  theforegoing Report, but it  should  be added that the  penultimatesentence of the second footnote on page 46 has been inserted sincethe text  was  approved by him.  All of which we  humbly  submit  for Your Majesty &apos;s graciousconsideration.E. LAWRENCE MITCHELL,         secretary. S.

      RESERVATION BY SIB EDWARD PEACOCK, G.C.V.O.  I very much regret that on one point of substance I differ fromirry colleagues.  We are all  agreed that in this very complicated matter the best that can be expected of any scheme for the extinguishment of titherentcharge is that substantial justice  should be done to the variousinterested  parties,  and we  are also  agreed as to the method  bywhich this may be brought  about.   Our difference arises over therelative amounts to be contributed by the tithe-payer and from public funds towards the cost of the scheme.  My colleagues think that theliability  of  the  tithe-payer  should be  limited to  the  payment ofredemption annuities for  a  period of 40 years, while, in my view the period should be 50 years.  The demands made upon  Government  credit  in these days arevery heavy, and one hesitated long before venturing to advise thecreation  of nearly  70,000,000 of new Government  stock.   If  ouradvice on this vital point should be  accepted the  Government  bylending its credit would be making a  very great contribution to thesolution of the tithe question.   It seems to me essential that anyfurther demands upon public funds involved in the operation of thescheme.should be kept at the irreducible minimum. The extensionfrom 40  to 50 years of the period  during  which the redemptionannuities should be payable  would reduce the contribution required from public funds by some  300,000 per.  annum,  and it  is  myconsidered  opinion that the  scheme as thus amended would not  beunjust to the tithe-payer.E. R.  PEACOCK.

                         REPORT           BY SIB LEONARD JAMES GO ATE STo THE KING&apos;S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY : I agree with my Fellow Commissioners in thinking that the onlysatisfactory treatment of the  problem of Tithe Bentcharge consists in the formulation of a scheme  for its  extinguishment at an earlydate but  I differ  from  them   fundamentally on the  followingpoints :      (1)  The nature and extent of the problem on which we were   commissioned to report;     (2)  The nature and status of Tithe Rentcharge itself ;     (3)  The  consideration to  be given to  the interests of  the   general taxpayer and the ratepayer ;     (4)  The annual  value  at which Tithe Bentcharge  should be   assessed for the purpose  of its extinguishment or continuance;     (5)  The  financial methods  which should  be  adopted  to   extinguish  Tithe Bentcharge. The  first part of the Majority Beport consists  of an  historicalreview   of  the legislation concerning  Tithe  Bentcharge and apresentation of the existing position and difficulties.  With thispart of the report I am glad to be able  to agree generally save thatI cannot bring  myself  to adopt  so limited an interpretation of theterms of the Commission reference. The  fundamental, points set out above, on  which I have been unable  to agree with the views of the Majority of the  Commission,have necessitated the adoption of a very  different line  of approach to the solution of the problem which has formed the subject of our deliberations.  It may be convenient therefore as an introductionto my proposals to set out the views which I have formed in relationto each  of the  five points.1. THE  NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE PEOBLEM ON  WHICH  WE WERE   COMMISSIONED  TO  BEPORT. The  main issue as regards Tithe  Bentcharge is in reality onebetween the tithe-payer and  the  Church.  The term &apos;&apos;  Church &apos;&apos; is here used in its popular sense; from thenarrower standpoint of tithe-owning  it should  be  taken to includethe  beneficed  clergy,   the  Ecclesiastical Corporations,   and  the ecclesiatical Commissioners in respect of the &quot; lay &quot; Tithe Rent-charge  which they own and which is available for  the more general purposes of the Church.  Lay  ownership  of  Tithe  Rentcharge  may  be regarded as anexcrescence upon the main object of  the tithe system, which wasthe support of  the  Church, and  one  to which separate considera-tions should be  applied.  It is clear from the evidence  we received that the present dis- wntent  is focussed upon the  Church, which collectively  is by far
 the  largest owner of  Tithe Eentcharge,  and with  which the tithe system in  whatever  form and by  whatever name it  is called  is inevitably  associated, and that its effect  is  detrimental to the influence of the Church.&quot;   It is also clear that the tithe-payer is ready to recognise that a payment is properly due to the owner of Tithe Eentcharge having regard  to the antiquity of tithe, from  which  it  is  derived, as a customary payment;  but if this point of view be pressed so far as to elevate Tithe Eentcharge to a status  superior even  to the land out  of  which  it arises f a conflict  of material interests is set up from which the  Church can only emerge victorious at the  expense of a much more  serious moral loss.   If such a status be conceded, and the concession of it is implicit in the  proposals of the Majority  Members, any  scheme  for the extinguishment of Tithe Eentcharge at an  early date can be made! practicable  only  by placing a very heavy burden on  the  shoulders: of the general taxpayer and ratepayer.  In a  later section^  of this Eeport I give my reasons for thinking that the  burden imposed by the proposals of the  Majority would exceed   600,000 per annum for a period of forty years in addition to the sum of  550,000 per annum at present  contributed  by way of a charge upon the Consolidated Pund towards  the relief of the ecclesiastical tithe-owner from  his liability for local rates.  In my judgment it would not only be unreasonable to ask the general taxpayer and  ratepayer to shoulder  a burden so heavy, and. indeed  disproportionate when  considered in relation to  the  total I amount of Tithe Eentcharge, but it would  be contrary  to. the best;. interests of the Church  to do so.  The history of the  regulation by  Parliament of tithe and Tithtl Eentcharge,  including  the  substitution  of  Tithe   Eentcharge1 for  tithe in  1836, may  be  described  as  one of a  long series of efforts to hold  the scales  between the  needs of  agriculture and  the needs of the Church; and  in the  sections of this  Report which follow an attempt  is made to examine again  the economit factors from that point of view.  It is, however, on account of the imponderable elements in the  situation that  the conclusion  has been reached that it  is  only by a sacrifice voluntarily accepted by the  Church as an  act of faith  that  a basis either  for continuation.. or extinguishment  of  Tithe  Eentcharge can  be achieved  wifli 1 harmony and general  goodwill, and that the creation of this good- I will  would  prove an immense gain  to the Church in the pursuant I of its spiritual mission, and would  be more  potent to promote the 1 well-being of the  Church and  the nation than  the more nicely I.calculated balance of material claims.  * e.g. Minutes of Evidence, 17th Day, page 513, para. 3.  t e.g.  Minutes of  Evidence, 14th  Day, Question  5196;  and  18th Ds! Questions 6307 and 6387  to 6391.  t See page 83.
  In seeking a solution of the problem, therefore, it has appearedto me to be necessary  to  have regard not only  to the  respectiverights of the parties under the existing law,  but also to economic factors as  they affect both tithe-payer  and tithe-owner.  It wouldin my opinion be unjust, as well as illogical, to base  a solution ofthe  problem upon the economic  ability of the tithe-payer  to  paywithout  taking into consideration  the economic necessity  of  theseveral classes of  tithe-owner to  receive,  or indeed  to seek  asolution on the  reverse  basis.  Clearly  if  any  such  unilateralsolution were attempted the result  might very  well be merely  thetransfer of  hardship from one class of  persons  to another.  It is perhaps significant  that in their evidence the ecclesiasticaltithe-owners  strongly  pressed  the  view that  in considering  the granting  of  voluntary  remissions   to  tithe-payers  who  pleadedfinancial hardship it  was just and  proper that they should take into consideration the whole of the income  of the tithe-payer from whatever source derived and not only that which he received fromthe land.  It would seem  to follow as a logical corollary that  in deciding what degree of  sacrifice, if  any, it would be proper to impose upontithe-owners in order to arrive at a solution of the problem, com-sideration  should be  given to the  ability of the  tithe-owner  to achieve the objects for/ which the tithe system was instituted either from other  resources  or from  a rearrangement and re-applicationof his existing resources.  Moreover, it will be seen from our published Minutes of Evidencethat a very large  proportion of the  evidence tendered by the titheowners, notably Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty, the Oxford Colleges,  theChurchmen&apos;s Defence Union  and the  Welsh  Commissioners was directed to  a statement of their economic  position  and  the  effect upon it, and upon their work, of a reduction in the amount of TitheRentcharge payable to them.   The evidence tendered by the repre-sentatives of the Convocations of Canterbury and York was devotedentirely to  this  aspect of the problem, and it  seems clear that  thetithe-owners themselves considered that this came within the scopeof the Commission^ enquiry and was a very material factor in  theconsideration of the problem with  which the  Commission had  todeal.  For these reasons I have formed the view that it is necessaryto take into consideration aspects of the problem  which the Majorityof the Commission have considered  to be outside the  scope  of  theenquiry.2. THE NATURE AND STATUS OF TITHE BENTCHARGE.  The origin of tithes, from which  Tithe Bentcharge is derived, isobscure, but  whether the  contribution of  them  was in  the firstinstance purely voluntary  or under  some form of compulsion it is sufficiently  clear that at their inception they were  levied upon  abasis designed to  distribute the burden according to the  ability tobear it, and that the objects for  which the levy was r-raised wereuniversally  accepted as necessary  and desirable.
   The heart of the present discontent lies, in  my opinion, in thetwin beliefs  that  the levy now  bears too hardly upon one  sectionof the community and that the purposes to which  the product ofthe  levy is  applied  are no longer so closely  identified with thewishes of the contributors, or could be achieved in part at any ratein some other  way.   This  discontent  although  more  acute  and  vocal  in times of depression  derives  its  force  from conditions  which  are  distinct from either depression or prosperity.   For  many centuries the  State  has authorised by  Acts  of theLegislature the continuance  of the  ancient  custom  of  collectingtithe by those persons who  from time to  time exercised such right.The Tithe  Act of 1836,  which commuted  tithe  into  Tithe Rent-charge, was but one of this series  of  Acts in that its effect was notto create property  for the benefit of certain  persons  (by whomindeed no  consideration was given in  1836 for any such creation)but  to continue their rights under the existing custom,  subject tovery definite limitations and restrictions! designed to remove  certainevil  effects of the custom which had manifested themselves  moreespecially in the discouragement of enterprise in agriculture.   The opinion has often  been expressed in Parliament&quot;  that  titheis in  its essence  national property which, for the  time being, is  * In this  connection  it is  of interest that Lord  Melbourne,  speaking inthe House of Lords  in the debate  on the  Ecclesiastical Commission  in 1837,said:        &quot; The  tithes and landed property in  the hands of clergymen, do not    belong to them, but it is a portion of the national  property, which has    been set aside, either by the institution of the  country,  or by the    superstitions of former ages,  for  the maintenance of the  Established    religion  of this country;  and being a  portion of that national property,    it is in the power of the  State, from time to time, to increase it, should    it be too  small, or to diminish it, if too large, and apply the surplus    to whatever  purposes might be considered the fittest to promote the    great end and object in view.  These are  the only safe principles upon    which the Legislature or  Government  can proceed.&quot;   (Vide Miall&apos;s    &quot;Title Deeds of the Church of England,&quot;  4th  Edition, p. 100.)and Lord Palmerston  (who was then Prime Minister) said in the House otCommons on the 27th May, 1856 :        &quot; I do not agree with those  who maintain that what is called the    property of  the Church  is so  strictly belonging to the ministers of    religion  that Parliament cannot deal with it.  Undoubtedly the property    of the Church belongs to the  State, and the State, represented by its    proper organ, the Legislature, has the power and the right of dealing    with that property as the circumstances  of the times  may require.&quot;    (Hansard&apos;s Parliamentary Debates, Vol. 142, pp.  767-8.)  To  come to more recent years,  during the  debate on  the Tithe Bill of1890, which  became the Tithe Act of 1891, Mr. Stuart Rendel and a numberof other speakers, on the occasion of the  debate on the Second  Reading inthe House of Commons on the 1st December,  1S91, expressed similar  views see Hansard&apos;s Parliamentary Debates, Vol. 349, pp. 270-331.  Throughoutall stages of the debates on this  Bill  this  view was  put forward,  both inthe House of  Commons and in the House of  Lords.  Typical speeches onthe point were made in the House of  Commons by Mr. T. H.  Bolton andMr. Labouchere (Hansard, Vol. 349, pp. 315-317, and 1370-1372)  and in theHouse  of Lords by the Earl of Kimberley (Hansard, Vol. 350, p. 1052).
granted to its recipients  (who  might  be described as the tenantsat will of the State) but with which in the ultimate issue the  state has the right to deal as it thinks fit.  In fact  this view  of the nature of Tithe Rentcharge  formed thebasis  of   the  Welsh  Church  Acts  of  1914  and  1919, whichexpropriated the ecclesiastical tithe-owners in Wales on the  basisof a life interest only,  and provided  for the  ultimate diversion  ofthe  residue  of such Tithe Rentcharge, left  over  after satisfying the  life interests,  to what were considered to be suitable  nationalpurposes.  It could hardly be contemplated that this  view  of Tithe Rent-charge as national property should be carried  to the point at whichthe rights  of the State as owner conflict with  other interests of theState  and  in particular with the needs  of agriculture.  It is also significant that in the case of the Disestablishment  ofthe  Welsh Church the interest of the  tithe-owner was considered to be limited to a life interest only.  For  these reasons,  I am unable to accept  the view  that theinterests of tithe-owners  are strictly comparable with those of theowners of other forms of property, but have arrived at the con-clusion that their ownership is  to be  regarded in a very real  senseas a limited* form of ownership.3. THE CONSIDERATION  TO BE GIVEN TO  THE  INTERESTS  OF THE    G-ENERAL TAXPAYER AND RATEPAYER.  Tithe Rentcharge has  become an  integral part of the general economic structure of the country  and is a factor in both imperial and local  taxation.  It  is a  rateable  hereditament  and  it  isestimated  that the  local authorities derive an annual income  from rates upon Tithe Rentcharge of about  1,000,000.  Where the Tithe Rentcharge arises out of  non-agricultural landthe  local  authority would  suffer  no  loss   of  revenue  from  itsextinguishment  because  the  separate value  now rated as  Rent-charge would merge in the value of the land, and the  loss of onerateable hereditament would be compensated by the increase in thevalue of another.  But it is estimated that of the total  revenue of  1,000,000 onlya small  percentage arises  from  non-agricultural  land,  and   as  &quot;&quot; On this point reference might be made to the  views of Lord Macaulayas expressed in the debate on the Irish Church Temporalities Bill on the&apos;1st April, 1833,  as follows:       &quot; His own opinion of Church  property was that it was a sort of  mixed   property that it  was something more  than a salary,  and  something.   less than an estate;  and no man could deny,  after  the cases he had   quoted, that the  Legislature had a right to deal with it.  Parliament,   had the same power to alter and remodel as to frame, and the Church   of England had no rights except under the act of the Legislature.&quot;&apos;    (Hansard&apos;s Parliamentary Debates,  Vol. XVI,  pp. 1389-90.)
agricultural land has been derated,  the  local authorities would be faced with a dead loss of revenue by reason  of the extinguishmentof all Tithe Rentcharge arising from agricultural  land.  It is true that  under the  existing arrangement for redemptionof Ecclesiastical Tithe Rentcharge over  a period of 85 years,  localauthorities are already facing the loss at the end of  that period ofa portion of this revenue,  and are also subject to immediate losses from time  to time  by the  process of voluntary  or compulsoryredemption by individual  tithe-payers.  These are factors which it  is proper to take into account in con-sidering the disturbance to  the  finances  of the local  authorities which would  be occasioned by a scheme  for the total  and earlyextinguishment of Tithe  Rentcharge  as a rateable  hereditament,and it  may well  be that  in view  of their  existence, and  of theprobable growth of rateable values in certain districts from other causes, the loss of revenue for which the  local authorities might reasonably look for compensation should be  estimated at consider-ably less than  1,000,000,  say  at the figure  of  750,000.  I am, however,  quite unable to agree with the Majority Membersof the Commission in thinking that this is a matter for which no provision need be made within the  finances of an extinguishmentscheme itself.  The theory advanced in  support of this view,  viz., that the loss to the local authorities is  a direct consequence of the derating ofagricultural land and not  a consequence of  the extinguishment of the  Rentcharge, is,  I think,  unsound, in  that  unless auextinguishment scheme be adopted  the loss  will not  arise; but even if the theory be accepted it cannot disguise the fact that anadditional  burden  will be laid either upon  the  ratepayer, if no compensation be given to the local authorities, or upon the generaltaxpayer if it be given.  The general taxpayer is already deeply concerned in the questionbecause out of the  1,000,000 which the  local authorities receiveapproximately  550,000 is contributed annually by way of a  charge upon the Consolidated  Fund in accordance with the  Tithe  Act of1925.  This contribution was  provided by Parliament in relief  of the ecclesiatical tithe-owner&apos;s liability  to rates,  and in the  absence of amending legislation, applies to the whole period of  85  years  over which the sinking fund provisions  for redemption of ecclesiasticaltithe extend.  The grant by Parliament was made in view of the impoverishedposition of the clergy at the time, and coincided with the stabilisation-tion of Tithe Rentcharge  at its present annual  value of 105. His therefore in the nature of an indirect  subvention to the Churchand one which might  naturally  be brought under review  shouldthe circumstances of the clergy alter, as  they might well  do  during a period of 85 years.  It was certainly not made in the form of, noi
leaving  a  balance  to  be provided for  out  of  the finances  of the extinguishment scheme of   ...    ...    200,000 In stating,  as  I have  done above,* that  the Majority scheme would  place an additional burden  on the shoulders of the generaltaxpayer and  ratepayer of over  600,000 for a period of 40 years,in addition to the sum  of  550,000 per  annum  at  present  con-tributed towards the relief of the ecclesiastical tithe-owner from hisliability for local rates, this figure of  200,000 has been added to the deficiency of  374,392 shown by  that  scheme before providing for expenses.4. THE ANNUAL VALUE  AT WHICH TITHE RENTCHARGE .SHOULD  BE   ASSESSED. I agree with the Majority of the Commission that the stabilisedvalue of  Tithe Rentcharge as fixed  by the Tithe  Act  of 1925 has proved to be on a basis which cannot in  equity  be  maintained, butI disagree as to the considerations which  should govern the revisionof the annual value. Prior to  the stabilisations effected  by the Tithe Acts of 1918 and1925, the basis of assessing the annual value of Tithe Rentchargewas the average of corn prices as explained in the First Part of theMajority Report. There seems, however, to be no  doubt that whilst corn pricesmay have  been a reasonably  accurate index in 1836  both of thecost of living and of the ability of agriculture to  bear the charge,they are no longer a reliable index of either.!  Corn growing nolonger occupies  the position  in  relation  to agriculture  in  thiscountry  which it did in 1836, and, as a measure of the farmers&apos;ability to pay, corn  prices are also  deficient in that  they bear no * See page 78. t Evidence to this effect was given by the Bursars of the Oxford Colleges1See Minutes of Evidence, 18th Day, page 526, para. iv. (e) 6. think intended as, a grant to the local authorities; but I haveeome to  the  conclusion  that  in  order  to render possible  anextinguishment scheme over a shorter period than 85 years it wouldbe reasonable to transfer the contribution from  the relief of rates on  the  clergy  as tithe-owners, which would  no longer be levied,to the relief of the local authorities in the districts and to the extent that  it  may be  shown to  be necessary over  the period of  theextinguishment scheme.                                                             If the compensation necessary to the local authoritiesbe taken at the annual figure suggested above of     ...     750,000the transfer of  the grant in this way would provide  that compensation to the extent of   ...     ...     ...    ...     550,000
reasonable relation to his  present  costs and profits.   Witnessesrepresenting tithe-owners have also pointed out that the price ofcorn does not now afford a good index to the cost of living.&quot;  I am, therefore,  unable to agree with the Majority of the  Corn-mission that an average of corn prices over a period of past years,however well selected that period  may be, constitutes a suitablebasis  for revision or is on that  account any the less  a prophecy asto the future.  The  dominant  consideration in  any  revision should  in myopinion be the needs and position of agriculture,  and in attempting to reconcile these with the reasonable demands of the tithe-ownerthe aim should, I think, be to secure that, whether for purposes ofcontinuance  or  extinguishment,  Tithe  Eentcharge  should not operate as a deterrent to enterprise and the introduction  of new capital.  Approaching the  question on  these lines I have come to the con-clusion that the annual  value, whether for  purposes  of extinguish-ment or continuance,  should be stabilised at a figure substantially below that recommended by the Majority  of the Commission forextinguishment purposes only.5. THE  FINANCIAL  METHODS  WHICH SHOULD   BE ADOPTED TO    EXTINGUISH TITHE EENTCHARGB.  I am unable to  agree that a scheme of  expropriation of  tithe-owners by means of a capital transaction, that is to say, one  underwhich a capital sum in  interest  bearing  stock  would  be awardedto the tithe-owner, is equally suitable  to all classes of tithe-owner.  For this purpose  I  consider  the present  owners of Tithe  Rent-charge  should be divided into three classes, which may  be roughlydescribed as the lay tithe-owners, the Welsh Commissioners, anithe tithe-owners associated with the Church  of  England.  The needs and position of these three classes  are  not the  same.  The Welsh Commissioners who were called into existence  underthe Welsh Church  Acts of  1914 and 1919 are really  a piece of administrative machinery for the  purpose of  carrying out the dis-establishment of the Welsh Church and the transfer of its property to other beneficiaries after meeting the obligations which they have incurred.   Considerations as to  these obligations have  been put before us by the Welsh Commissioners, and upon the  manner inWhich they can be met the amount  which the  beneficiaries will ultimately receive would appear to  depend.  That,  however, is smatter which in my judgment  would  be much more appropriatelyand conveniently settled by the experience  both of collections andof money  rates over the period of extinguishment of Tithe  Rent-charge  than by any attempt to anticipate such experience now.-  * e.g. Queen Anne&apos;s  Bounty.  Minutes of Evidence, 14th. Day, page 391,col. 1,  para 3.
  In the case of the Tithe Eentcharge belonging to  what may bepopularly termed the Church of England, which includes the major part of the incomes of the beneficed Clergy, the position and claims of the poorer Clergy, which have been strongly urged  before  us,inevitably  give  rise to considerations  affecting the distribution ofthe  total  income  received by the Church from this source, andpending an examination of those considerations by the Church it isin my judgment  not only  unnecessary but undesirable that thecompensation to be given to the Church  should be  integrated in capital form to the individual benefice and  corporation or indeedtake  capital form  at all.  Whilst  therefore I have come to the conclusion that a capitalscheme on similar lines  to that  recommended by  the Majorityof the Commission  is the most suitable method of  compensatingthe interests of the lay  tithe-owner, I have  sought other financialmethods for dealing  with the  interest in Tithe  Eentcharge of the welsh Commissioners and the Church of  England.  The above then are the points on which I am at  variance withthe Majority of the Commission and the reasons for the  differences which exist between us, and on  the basis of  the position  asbriefly outlined above I now proceed to  formulate  the  proposalswhich I recommend should be adopted as a solution of the  titheproblem.  In seeking an alternative solution greater regard should, I think,be had to  the needs and position  of agriculture on  the one  handand  to the separate  circumstances of the  several classes of  tithe-owner on  the other.           The Position  and Heeds of   Agriculture.  It  is not easy to  determine the point   at which the  burden of the Eentcharge becomes a deterrent to enterprise and encroachesupon the landowners margin for repairs  and upkeep generally.  It  was  contended  on  behalf of  tithe-owners that  this  point could not  have  been reached, in view of the reasonable degree ofpromptitude with which the Tithe Rentcharge  had been collecteduntil the influence of political agitation made itself felt.  But the principle adopted by Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty in consider-ing  applications for  reduction  of  Tithe Bentcharge  payable, viz.that  it is  the financial  ability of the tithe-payer from all  sources and not merely from the land subject to  Tithe Rentcharge whichshould be  taken into account,  robs  this contention of most  of itsforce.  On the other hand there is a considerable body of evidence, both from landowners  and economists, tending to show that owing tothe  rise in wages  and costs generally the margin of profit availablefor  maintenance  has declined, and that  the  state of  repair of farms has  deteriorated accordingly.
  The difficulty  of arriving  at  a reliable average of agriculturalconditions in relation to Tithe Rentcharge has been emphasised bythe  economists who have given evidence,  but,  subject  to  thatqualification,   I   accept  the  statement  made  by   Sir  WilliamDampier* backed as it  is by great authority  and by the experienceof representative  estates in the  West of England,  the SouthernCounties, East Anglia, the Midlands and the  North, that  &quot; TitheRentcharge now  ranges round some such amounts as 3s. per acre,2s. 8d. in the pound of gross rental,  and on large or moderate sizedestates  5s.  4d. in the pound of residual  income, i.e., the rentalreduced  by  the   average  proportion  of  outgoings  other thantithe.&quot;  In the light of this ratio of Tithe  Rentcharge to residual incomeit is difficult to escape the conclusion that by reason of a change in conditions  the real burden of  Tithe Rentcharge has grown, and now exceeds  the  burden of tithes which it  replaced and also theburden  of  Tithe  Rentcharge as  contemplated at  the time of itsinception.  It is significant that in presenting the detailed figures on whichthese averages are based the witness thought  it desirable to showalso  the  lower ratio of  Tithe  Rentcharge  to  residual  income whichwould  result  &quot; by paying  nothing for management  and  reducingrepairs &quot;, viz. about 3s. 6d. per pound of residual value, or approxi-mately one-third  less, and that this lower ratio is assumed to be the ratio applying to the  class of  owner  occupiers.  It is clear that  there have been very large  changes in the owner-ship of land since the War (some witnesses estimated that as muchas thirty per cent, of the land in England and Wales had changedhands)!  and a considerable increase in the number of owner-occu-piers,t and  the more limited resources of this class of owner render it especially  desirable  in  the interests of  agriculture  that  TitheRentcharge should not  be at such a level as to  cause it to starve the funds available for maintenance and repairs.  A good deal has been said by witnesses on behalf of tithe-ownersas to the recurrence of  discontent in times of  depression  and asto the  temporary character of  the present  depression  notwith-standing the length of its duration, but if it  is desirable to stabilise the value of Tithe Rentcharge,  as I think it  is, it would  seem tobe necessary  to stabilise it at such  a  level as to be  tolerable evenin times of  depression.  A  further application of the  principle,  introduced  by the Act of1891, of a maximum ratio of  Tithe Rentcharge to the annual value  * See Minutes of Evidence, 20th Day, page 616, para. 13.  t See Minutes of Evidence, 3rd Day, page 71, para. 10 (d);  and 5th Day,Question 1590.  t See Minutes  of Evidence,  3rd  Day,, page 71, para. 10  (c);  9th Day,Question 2940;  and 10th Day, Questions 3249-50.
of land, would go a long way towards meeting the cases of hard-ship; but remissions of Tithe Rentcharge in this way, even thoughextended so as  to  remit the excess over one-third of the  annual value of  agricultural land, which in common  with the- MajorityMembers I recommend, are  from year to year only and have no effect upon  the price at which Tithe Rentcharge may be redeemedunder the existing law. There is  therefore a danger, if these remissions alone  be relied upon to remove  any excessive burden of Tithe Rentcharge,  of  alimited  recurrence  of the evil of &quot; the growing tithe &quot;  in  a new form, because the result of improvements and the introduction of fresh capital would be to increase the effective amount  of TitheRentcharge in cases where the tithe-payer was previously entitledto remission. This   consideration  assumes  greater   importance  when  it  isremembered that hardship is  not confined to isolated instances, butthat there  are  classes of land,  notably the corn  lands of  BastAnglia and  the  Southern Counties, which by reason of changes in world conditions since the commutation may  be said to share  acommon hardship in greater or lesser degree. It is, I think, clear that some lightening of the burden of TitheRentcharge of more general application than individual remissionsis required  to prevent it from  becoming&apos; a deterrent to  enterprise and  the  introduction of fresh capital. The large subsidies granted by  Parliament  for the  productionof wheat, beef,  milk  and beet  sugar  are proof of  the difficulties with which agriculture is attended and  of the need to  encourageenterprise and attract fresh capital to facilitate the new methods and  types of agriculture  upon  which  reliance  is placed for there-establishment of the industry  on a  profitable basis. It  therefore  appears that reversion  to  a  Tithe  Rentchargefluctuating  with corn  prices, or some  other index of the value ofagricultural produce, suggested by some witnesses,* whilst it mightafford an immediate relief,  would  in  the long  run operate  as  a deterrent to enterprise by reason of the uncertainty of its operation. Whether Tithe Rentcharge be continued or extinguished there-fore, I am of opinion that the value of Tithe Rentcharge should be stabilised, and that the  present figure of 105 should be  revised. That figure was based upon an attempt to forecast the  course ofcorn prices  in perpetuity, but whilst the ten years which have  sinceelapsed have falsified the estimate which was made for those years,it is rather upon an estimate of the position and needs of agriculturethat I propose to rely in attempting a revision of the figure thanupon any new  attempt  to forecast the future. * o.g.

  * See Minutes of Evidence, 3rd Day, page 63, para. 3; and Questions 688to 696. &apos; t C. 9142.  In  the  light  of  these considerations I  recommend that  thestabilised value of Tithe Eentcharge per  100 par value be  reducedby two stages as under :     On  1st April, 1936   .........from   105 to  90    On a day to be appointed but not later       than 1st April, 1939       ......  from    90 to  80and that the sinking fund payments of  4  10s. per annum in  thecase of  Ecclesiastical  Tithe  Eentcharge be  suspended  as from 1st April, 1936.       Circumstances of the several Classes of Tithe-owner.  Parliament has already made distinctions in its treatment of  theseveral classes of tithe-owner,  notably in the provision of a  SinkingFund for the redemption of Ecclesiastical Tithe Eentcharge  withoutany similar provision for the owner of Lay Tithe Eentcharge andalso as regards the  burden of local taxation.  On Tithe Eentcharge of  100 par value the actual burden on  theseveral classes  of tithe-owner  if rates  are levied  at 10s. in the &amp;is as follows :                                                         s. d.    Incumbents  of  benefices       ...     ...     ...   5  00    Ecclesiastical Corporations     ...     ...    ...  16  0  0    Welsh  Commissioners  in  respect  of   Tithe       Eentcharge previously attached to  a benefice  16 12  6    All other owners  ...     ...     ...     ...    ...  33  5  0  These  distinctions  are  not  distinctions   made by the localauthorities  in the rating of  Tithe  Eentcharge, which is  in  factassessed upon a  uniform basis irrespective of ownership,  but  arethe result of reliefs granted to the ecclesiastical tithe-owner in con-sideration of his  financial circumstances  and needs.  One witness&quot;  laid before the Commission evidence in support ofthe view that in  equity Ecclesiastical Tithe should have been ratedin the  first instance  only according to  the parson&apos;s  &quot; ability&quot;within the meaning of the Statute of  Queen  Elizabeth, that is tosay,  according to any surplus of income after providing  for  hismaintenance.and necessary outgoings incurred in the performance of his  duties.  Some  support for  this view  is lent by the Second Eeport of  theEoyal  Commission on Local  Taxation in 1899, t  but  whether  theview be correct or not the fact  remains  that the commutation ot1836 was made on the basis that Tithe Eentcharge would be subjectto rates  as  then  being levied  on  the tithes,  and in any review of

Any scheme for the extinguishment of Tithe Eentcharge must,however,  have regard to the net  income of which the tithe-owneris in enjoyment at  the  time of  extinguishment, and although itmight  be  argued that logically the ecclesiastical tithe-owner shouldsuffer the same deduction in  arriving at the net income for purposesof compensation  as  the  lay tithe-owner,  it  would appear to beequitable to give some recognition in this respect  to the concessions which  the ecclesiastical tithe-owner at present enjoys under  Statuteand  to make some discrimination  in his  favour.  Such a  discrimination, based as it is upon considerations affectinghis  financial  circumstances,  points  the way  to  a  discrimination between the three main  classes of tithe-owner in any attempt to formulate a scheme  for extinguishment of the Tithe Eentcharge asa whole.   The three main classes of tithe-owner and  the approxi-mate par value  of  the  Tithe Bentcharge owned by  each are asunder :                                                           1.

once  and for all  by means  of a capital transaction;  the largerdeduction in respect of local rates at  present suffered by this classof tithe owner also renders a capital scheme  more  practicable intheir  case because of the larger proportionate contribution  towards a  sinking fund to replace their  smaller net  income which eachpound per  100&apos; par value added by the tithe-payer represents.   The  Welsh  Commissioners  are  also  a   secular  body,  andthe Church  in Wales is in no way interested in the future of TitheEentcharge, but their circumstances are peculiar in that the TitheEentcharge  which they own has  been acquired by them from theEepresentative  Body  of  the  Church  in  Wales and   from the ecclesiatical Commissioners, partly  by  purchase and  partly  bytransfer  subject to the compensation of  the  life interests of theclergy but in either case  by  means of borrowed  monies,  and theCommissioners have  made clear  to us that, with any  substantial reduction of the stabilised value of Tithe Eentcharge they would be unable  to meet their obligations to  the National Debt  Com-missioners.*   These circumstances lend  themselves more conveniently to anarrangement for redemption  of the Tithe Eentcharge  by  degreesand over a fixed period than to an immediate capital transaction.  Inany arrangement to award the tithe-owner a capital  sum, whether in the form  of stock or otherwise, some  risk of loss by reason of failure  to collect or  further  concessions would be run  by theGovernment.   In  view,  however, of  the substantial contribution  which Parlia-ment  has  already  made  to  assist  the finances  of the  WelshCommission, t  and of the fact that  its  beneficiaries include the welsh County Councils and the University of Wales,  it would seemmore  appropriate that the amount of  that beneficial interest shouldbe determined  by the experience of the years  during which TitheEentcharge  is being extinguished by the contributions of the tithe-payer, and  that any  adjustment of the existing  obligations of theCommissioners should be made  as and when it is shown to benecessary.   The treatment  of  these two classes  of tithe-owner by methodssuited to their  peculiar  circumstances  has  the  great merit of resolving  the final problem of the  extinguishment of Tithe Bent-charge  into  a  problem directly affecting the  tithe-payer and theChurch of England alone.  That problem  is more difficult and Ipropose to deal with it separately, i  At this stage it will be sufficientto indicate that in my opinion a  capital scheme  would  not form abasis  for a suitable solution of it  from any point of view.* See Minutes of Evidence, 16th Day, pages 463-4, para. 24.t See Minutes of Evidence, 16th Day, page 458, para. 4.t See pages 98 to 103.
 Main Provisions of suggested Scheme  for Extinguishment  of                      Tithe Rentcharge. Before considering further the  separate  circumstances of thethree main classes of tithe-owner, it.may be convenient to set outthe main provisions of the  scheme  for  extinguishment of TitheRentcharge  which I desire to recommend. As from the appointed day, not later  than 1st  April, 1939, onwhich  in accordance with my  earlier recommendation  the  grossannual value of Tithe Eentcharge if continued would fall to  80 per 100 par value, I recommend that  the tithe-payer&apos;s liability to payTithe Rentcharge should cease, and, that there should be substitutedfor it the liability to pay by  equal  half yearly instalments a TitheRedemption Annuity,  not  rateable  and  ceasing  at  the  end  of40 years, of an amount equal to  90 per   100 par value of TitheEentcharge. Also that of the  90&apos;  annuity,  10 be regarded as the proportionrepresenting capital  redemption, and that the balance of  80  betreated  as an allowable deduction in arriving at annual income forpurposes of  taxation. The  remission in  the  case of   Tithe  Rentcharge  arising  fromagricultural land of  the excess over one third of the annual valueof the land, which in common with the Majority of the commission i recommend, should I think be granted  by  reference to the wholeof the annuity and not to the income portion of the annuity only. I  recommend that  a  Tithe  Redemption  Commission be  con-stituted  to receive and  adjudicate upon the  claims of  tithe-owners and  to undertake, in close  association with the  Board  of InlandRevenue, the collection of the  Tithe Bedemption Annuities; andthat there be transferred to the Commission the powers and duties in respect of reapportionment and otherwise  at present attaching to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.  In the case of the owners of Lay Tithe Bentcharge, other  thanthe  Welsh  Commissioners  and  the   Ecclesiastical   Commis-sioners,  I recommend that compensation  for the surrender of TitheRentcharge take the form of :Stock, guaranteed by the Treasury,redeemable by drawings  over a period of 40 years or by purchase in the  open market if  below par.  The amount of Stock to be awarded in respect of each  100 parvalue of Tithe Bentcharge,  found  by the Tithe Bedemption  Com-raissioners to be properly in  collection, to be the capital sum whichat the rate of interest  provided on the Stock  will yield an incomeequal  to the estimated net income from  a gross Tithe Bentchargeof  80,  subject to a deduction equal to 10 per cent, of net income to allow for the improvement in security  to the tithe-owner whichthe  Stock would afford.*  * Such a reduction  was proposed in a scheme advanced by  an eminenteconomist who appeared before  us as a witness. See Minutes of Evidence,19th Day, page 574, para.  10; and Question 6910.   30944                                                    D
  In  computing  the  net income the cost  of  collection  should, Ithink, be taken at the uniform  rate of 5 per cent, of  80 or   per  100 par  value.  The  Commissioners  should also have  theright  in cases  where  the Tithe Eentcharge,  if calculated  at  therate of  80  per   100 par value,  would have exceeded one-thirdof the gross annual value of the land for any  agricultural holding,as assessed  to  Income Tax  Schedule B for the five  years  ending on 5th  April, 1936, to make a deduction from the net income forpurposes of compensation of 50 per cent,  of  the  average of suchexcesses.  Assuming an average liability  for Land Tax of  1  per  100  parvalue, and an  average poundage of 10s.  for local  rates, it is esti-mated that  the net income for  compensation purposes  would onthe average amount to   44 14s. per  100 par value, and if  theStock carried interest at the rate  of 3 per cent,  per annum,  thecapital compensation would amount to  1,490 Stock  per  100  parvalue.  The approximate average  figure  of  44 14s. per  100 par value is arrived at as under :                                              s.  d.         s. d.

The receipts from this portion of the Tithe Eedemption Annuitieswould be carried by  the Commissioners to a  separate fund to be known  as the  Capital  Fund, and  applied  for the  service of theStock and in other  ways as set out later in this report.  The extinguishment  of the Tithe  Eentcharge belonging to the welsh  Commissioners  and  the Church of  England respectively,using the latter term in the  broad sense, would involve no capitaltransaction, but  the  receipts of Tithe  Eedemption Annuities i)Jthe Commissioners would be carried to two separate funds to be
known as the Welsh Fund and  the Church  of England Fund re-respecively.    The  proposed method  of  applying the  receipts  ofthose  two funds is  also dealt with later* in this report.  Effect of the Scheme upon Local Taxation and  Land Tax. The loss  which  would be  entailed upon  local  authorities byreason of the extinguishment  of Tithe Kentcharge  as  a rateablehereditament, and  the  reasons for  thinking  that  provision shouldbe  made within the scheme itself  for  compensating  the  localauthorities, have been explained  in  an earlier partt  of this report. Whilst, however, a  scheme of extinguishment of Tithe Rent-charge which compounds with the  tithe-owner his future liability for  rates cannot in equity omit  to  make provision within its  ownfinances  for the consequence to  the local authorities of such com-pounding, the selection of  the method in  which  such  a provision is to  be  applied at once  introduces wider  considerations, and thequestion  is seen to be  a subordinate part only of a much largerquestion  which is outside the province of the Commission, namely,the question of the  Exchequer Grants to local authorities generally. Districts will not  be affected  equally  either in  regard to theproportion which the rateable value extinguished  bears to the totalrateable  value of the district,  or in regard to the factors tending to mitigate  the loss  by the growth of rateable value  from other causes. The appropriate method of application of any provision containedin the scheme of extinguishment would therefore appear to be byway of annual contribution  to a Guarantee Fund to be drawn upon by  the Treasury. I have  suggested in an earlier part of this report! that the reason-able claims  of the  local authorities to compensation in respect  ofthe loss of rates amounting to approximately   1,000,000 might beestimated at three-quarters of that figure,  or  750,000, and I recom-mend that  550,000 of  this total should be met by transfer to theGuarantee Fund of the  grant in relief of the Ecclesiastical tithe-owners&apos; rates provided  by the Tithe Act of 1925, thus  leaving a balance of approximately  200,000  to be provided by the schemeof extinguishment. In  drafting the  proposals for  the application of the  Tithe  Re-redemption Annuities in the three funds as  set out above,  it has beenconsidered equitable to  make provision in the case of the first  twofunds, which are  intended to be  self-supporting, for  a paymentannually  to the Guarantee Fund  of a sum  equivalent  to three-quarters  of the liability to rates  which is in  effect compounded in arriving at the  net  income for purposes of  compensation, or wherecapital compensation does not arise,  as would have been payable* See pages 97 and 101. 30914t See pages 81 to 83.t See page 82.
on the average poundage for the last  three years if Tithe Rentcharge had continued to be collected at the rate of   80 per  100par value.  Such contributions would, of course, cease in any event at theend of the 40 years&apos; period of the annuities and would abate withany  permanent  abatement  of the demands  upon the guarantee fund.  In the case of the Church of England Fund, the contribution hasbeen calculated at a lower rate, one-half instead of three-quarters,This  lower rate is rendered  possible  by the proposal  to  transfer to the Guarantee  Eund  without abatement the  grant of  5 50,00(1in which the Church  is  alone concerned.  As  compared  with the  provision of  200,000 estimated to benecessary the contributions made in the estimates of  the operationof the three funds amount to  a total of  218,388.  The position as  regards Land Tax  is similar but  distinct, anda provision has been made in the recommendations for applicationof the Tithe Redemption Annuities in ,all three funds for a pay-ment under similar conditions to a fund for the  relief of the Lan:Tax quotas  equivalent to three  quarters  of  the annual  liability for Land Tax on the average for the  three years prior to thecommencement  of the  Redemption Annuities.     Detailed Application of  Scheme to Individual Classes of                          Tithe-Owner.  Any estimate of the operation of the scheme  must of course bebased  to  some extent upon assumed averages,  but  it is  believedthat the figures which follow will explain the  application of thegeneral provisions of the scheme to the three main, classes of tithe-owner respectively.1. LAY TITHE-OWNERS DEALT  WITH BY  WAY OP CAPITAL  SCHEME.   This class embraces all owners of Lay Tithe  Rentcharge, otherthan   the    Welsh  Commissioners   and   the    EcclesiasticalCommissioners, and the Tithe Rentcharge affected is estimated  tobe  of the par value of   532,598.   The revised gross annual value of the Tithe Rent-charge at 80 per cent, would accordingly amount to ...     426,079and the net income for  purposes  of  compensation subject to any  reductions by the Commissioners onaccount of  excess of  the   Tithe  Rentcharge  over one-third of  annual value to  44 14s. per  100 parvalue  or  ..........    ....  &apos;   .........     238,0713 per cent.

WELSH COMMISSIONERS. The  Report  of  the  Welsh  Commissioners  for  1933  showsthat at the end of that year the balance of indebtedness incurred insatisfying the claims of the Representative Body of the Church in wales in respect of the commutation of  the life interests, in pay-ing compensation to lay  patrons, and in  the acquisition  of certainblocks of Tithe Rentcharge from the Representative Body and the ecclesiatical Commissioners  was as under :     National Debt  Commissioners  at 5^  per cent.   1,858,682   Representative  Body of the Church  in Wales     at 4 per cent.  ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     90,500   Ecclesiastical Commissioners at 4 per cent.  ...     40,638 1,989,820 The  loan  from  the  National Debt Commissioners, which was originally   2,350,000,  was guaranteed  by  the  Treasury  and isrepayable  by an annuity representing capital and interest,  calcu-lated  at  the  rate  of  5J  per  cent., payable half-yearly  up. to20th February, 1954. The   evidence*   tendered    by  the   Welsh   Commissionersshows however that  this borrowing was not sufficient  to meet thefinancial needs of  the  Commission in carrying out the  provisionsof the  Welsh Church Act,  1914, as to  severance  of the  TitheBentcharge from the benefices,  and that the value of the propertyalienated from the  Church was  insufficient  to  provide  adequatesecurity for the repayment within a reasonable period of any loanthat the Commissioners would  have  to raise to pay the sum dueto the Representative Body by  way of commutation together with interest upon it at the prevailing rate.  * See Minutes of Evidence, 16th Day, pages 457-8, paras. 3 to S.30914                                                    E 2

In view of this position the Welsh Church (Temporalities) Act, I 1919,  provided for a grant  by Parliament  of   1,000,000 to the welsh  Commissioners   to  be  applied   by  them  towards  the payment of the sum due to the Representative Body.   The amount  of the annuity now payable to the National DebtCommissioners  is  152,308*  and the par value of the Tithe Bent-charge in the hands of  the Commissioners is  205,500&apos;  so that inthe event of a reduction of the stabilised value of Tithe Bentchargeto 80 the gross income from that source  would  be  164,400,  andthe net income would not be likely to exceed  120,000,t and theCommission would  be unable  to  meet its obligations.   The Commissioners have stated in  evidence^  that such a situa-tion could only  be met in one of two ways, &quot;either by the Treasuryimplementing its guarantee as occasion may require, and advancingthe  necessary  monies to enable the  Commissioners to make thepayments due,  which of course, will  have to be repaid when theloan is discharged, or by a reduction of the amount of the annuitypayable half-yearly  in conjunction with an extension of  the periodof repayment.&quot;   The  situation is one which lends itself  more  naturally  to  arepayment of the Obligations over a period and  out of the moniesto be  received from  Tithe  Bedemption  Annuities than to any form of capital  transaction such as the issue of Stock.   Moreover if an immediate capital settlement of  the interests of thebeneficiaries of  the  Welsh  Tithe Bentcharge were to be  attemptednow, various risks would require  to be assessed  on a basis whichwould  safeguard the public purse, and some regard would requireto be had to the assistance  already  given to the beneficiaries bymeans of the  1,000,000 grant  by  Parliament.   The beneficiaries  are the Welsh University, the Welsh Colleges,the National Library and the Welsh County  and Borough Councils,and it is safe to assume  that  it  would  not further the  interestsof any of those bodies to attempt to exact  terms of  settlement which would place a heavier burden on the Welsh tithe-payer than he is able to bear, or than  is imposed on the English tithe-payer.  * Figure as at the end of 1933.

On similar assumptions  as to cost of collection, Land Tax,  andlocal rating to  those adopted in the case of other lay owners, it  estimated  that the operation of the Welsh Fund  by the  TitheRedemption Commissioners would be as under :                    Operation  of  Welsh  Fund.

If  accumulated at 3J per cent, over the 40  years&apos; period theywould amount  to  capital sums  of   2,280,603  and   4,874,038respectively.  I suggest however that  if the operation of the Fund showed ataccumulated  surplus at the end of the first ten years a partial dis-tribution of it should be made to the beneficiaries without awaiting the final determination of the value of their property.  I  also suggest  that the  dissolution of  the Welsh  Commis-sion and the transfer of its property, obligations, and duties to theproposed Tithe Redemption Commissioners  should  receive con-sideration.3.  THE CHTJKCH  OP ENGLAND.  The amount of  Tithe  Rentcharge  enjoyed by  the Church ofEngland, using the word  &quot; Church &quot;  in the broadest sense, is atpar value  2,362,032,&apos;  This figure comprises three sections of Tithe Rentcharge  whichhave  already  been set  out but may  for convenience be repeatedhere.   They  are : Owned  by Queen  Anne&apos;s Bounty :                           (i) In  trust  for  benefices  ...     ...    ...     ...   1,992,288  (ii) In trust for Ecclesiastical  Corporations      ...      95,744Lay Tithe Rentcharge  held  by  the  Ecclesiastical     Commissioners  for the  benefit of the Common     Fund  of the  Commissioners     ...    ...     ...     274,000 2,362,032
 The figure given in evidence by  Queen  Anne&apos;s Bounty as the far or commuted value of Benefice Tithe Bentcharge (which figurehas been reduced by subsequent redemptions) was  1,998,070 andthe evidence&quot; given on behalf of the Bounty showed that this was distributed over  6,995  livings as follows : -         Values of Livings        (based  on the  Church        of England Pensions        Board Assessments).Not  exceeding  300Exceeding  300 but not ex-  ceeding  500Exceeding  500   .......Annual Commuted		Value of TitheNumber of	RentchargeLivings.	Attached.	 1,137	191,4783,829	837,3922,029	969,2006,995	 1,998,070 The  case of the poorer clergy was put before us very ably andwith scrupulous  fairness by the Bishop of  St.  Edmundsbury andIpswich,  and any settlement of the vexed question of Tithe Bent-charge which  imposed  a  further hardship  on a body of men sodeserving and hard pressed, would not  only offend the public con-science, but in my judgment would be entirely foreign to the aims of the  hard pressed tithe-payer. But  hard cases make bad law, and as  will be seen  from theabove table the amount of Tithe Bentcharge attached to the poorerbenefices represents less than one-tenth  of the total  of BeneficeTithe Bentcharge. . It is, I think, abundantly clear that separate measures  should beadopted to provide for the needs of the poorer beneficed clergy ratherthan that an attempt should be made to exact from the tithe-payerterms which  would satisfy not the average  of needs but  the needsof the most  indigent incumbent. The need for  separate treatment however suggests  the question as to whether it is necessary  or  proper that the Church  should look to Parliament and the general tax payer for assistance in deal-&apos;ing with the  problem, or whether  the problem  is susceptible ofsolution by rearrangements within  the Church  itself and by a re-marshalling of its own resources.  One incumbent who appeared before ust gave  it as his  opinion    there were far too many rural  parishes in view  of  the much greater facility of transport at the present  time, and  deplored thefact ihat young  men were settling down as incumbents of parishesif 2G0 and 300  inhabitants and with very little to do for the restof their  lives, when at the same time new towns are  springingop, new  dormitory towns, and housing estates,  where no provision is made for the ministrations of the Church.  * See Minutes of Evidence, 14th Day, page 392.  t See Minutes of Evidence, 17th Day, Questions 6222 and 6247-8.
  It appears  that  the  Union of Benefices Act which permits ofsuch arrangements as  between  parishes has  not  been very fruitful of  results, owing no doubt  to natural local prejudices,  but ifthe need for  rearrangement be  recognised as a national one,  and dealt with  on national lines  and in earnest of an  endeavour tomeet the needs of the tithe-payer and  of  agriculture half way, itmay surely be taken that local prejudice would be subordinated tothe interests of the Church and the country as a whole.  Such  a  scheme  of rearrangement  might make  it  necessary to seek the power from Parliament to sever the Tithe  income fromthe individual benefices, and  to transfer the  income to  a centralfund.  It would also  be necessary to respect the life interest ofthe sitting  incumbents.  But  the formulation of such a scheme  should not be impracticable for the  Church,  from  whom  alone  it  could  proceed, and in my judgment any claim by the Church for  substantial assistance fromthe State in the settlement of the long  standing question of TitheBentcharge is ill founded unless  and  until the  financial possibilitiesof such a scheme of reorganisation have been  fully  examined.  I recommend that in the  three years,  or  lesser  period,  intervening between the coming into force of the  proposed new stabilised value of  90 per   100 Tithe Bentcharge (par value) and theappointed  day,  the Church  Assembly  be  required  to  formulatesuch a Scheme for the approval of Parliament, and  that to assistthe poorer clergy during the same period, and to form the nucleus of a Central Fund, a  grant  be  made by Parliament of   100,000in each  of those  years.  Pending the outcome  of such an  inquiry  by the  Church it isin my  judgment impossible to determine whether or not the TitheBedemption Annuities  I  propose will  be adequate  to  meet  the true needs of the Church having  regard to &quot; the wants and circum-stances of the places in which such tithes now  arise or have hereto-fore arisen. &quot;*  In  the cases of the  other  classes of tithe-owner  it  has, it isbelieved, been shown  that -the Bedemption Annuities at  90 per 100 Tithe Bentcharge (par  value) are  adequate to provide  a justcompensation for the net income surrendered.   Ecclesiastical tithe-owners are  differentiated from the other classes of  tithe-owner, onaccount  of  the  larger  net income which  they have enjoyed  per 100 par value owing  to the reliefs  from local rating which hawbeen granted to  them  at the expense of the  general taxpayer inconsideration  of their financial needs.  In my judgment the time  is not opportune, and may never beopportune, to determine in capital form  the extent  if  any to whicbthese concessions should be secured permanently to the Church.  Nor  does it appear  to me  to  be proper for anyone other that the Church itself to determine the extent  to  which it is desirable* Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act, 1840, Section 67.
   that its resources in  annual income  should  be capitalised for  the   endowment of the future and how far these  resources are required   for  immediate needs.    The Eeport of the  Ecclesiastical Commissioners for 1934 shows   that partly by benefactions, but mainly  by  the steady capitalisa-   tion of surplus income, the operations of the  Commissioners over aI   period  of  94 years have  resulted in increased  provision  for  the   cure of  souls in  necessitous parishes  in the  English dioceses of a   value exceeding   2,315,000 per annum, a figure which it will beI   observed exceeds the  par  value of the  Benefice  and Ecclesiastical&apos;i   Corporation Tithe Rentcharge combined.    One  of  the  sources from which these  accumulations of income   have been derived is the income from  the block of Lay Tithe Bent-   charge in  the hands  of the Commissioners the  commuted annualI   value of which is  274,000.    The purposes  to which  the Common Fund of the Ecclesiastical   Commissioners, of which the  above income forms a part, may be   applied  are defined by  Section 67  of the Ecclesiastical Commis-1   sioners Act, 1840, of which the following is an excerpt :  :     &apos;&apos; and by payments or investments made out  of such fund . . . :     additional provision shall be made, by the authority hereinafter ;     provided, for the cure of souls in parishes where  such assist- ;     ance is most required,  in such  manner as  shall,  by  the like &apos;     authority, be deemed most conducive to  the efficiency  of  the      Established  Church.&quot;I    If therefore it  is deemed necessary that there should be hereafter   a permanent endowment of  the  Benefices  and Corporations  at   present  dependent for  then  income  upon Tithe Bentcharge, it   would seem appropriate that the net  income  from this Lay  Tithe,   or the  Annuities to be received in  redemption  of it,  should beI   regarded as available for application to that end. -   With  the object of  ascertaining how  far these ends can be metI   from the resources available in the Tithe Redemption  Annuities,   including the  Annuities in  respect of  Lay  Tithe Rentcharge  at   present  held  by  the  Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the following   estimate is submitted of the operation of the  suggested Church of   England Fund by the Tithe Redemption Commissioners.

Other  General  Considerations. There is one frequently recurring point in the  evidence  tenderedon  behalf of tithe-owners, which  it is  evident has also  been thesubject of public controversy, upon which it may  be desirable  tomake some comment here in the hope  of  removing  a  misunder-standing. This is the point  which was made in the Statement of Evidence tby Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty in the  following  terms :      &quot;Tithe Bentcharge is a payment  in  the nature of a Rent-   charge issuing  out of the lands, and, unlike  tithes in kind,  is * For 43 years  commencing from the suspension of payments into the fund t See Minutes of Evidence, 14th Day, page 393, para. 32.                    45,729,2161,369,281 4,107,692     5,476,9731,664,2011,451,096
    not merely a part of the produce or increase of the lands.  Its    capital value was discounted  when  the  landowner bought the    land and  has been brought into account on any payment of    death duties  on the land &quot;.  reference to the Estate Duty Office shows, however, that in valu-ing titheaJble land for purposes of estate duty it is  usual, and inthis respect it is believed that the Department follows the ordinarypractice in the purchase and sale of such land, to deduct the annualamount of the Tithe Rentcharge from the estimated annual valueof the  land if untithed, and to apply to the net sum the multiplierrequired to arrive at capital value which represents the number ofyears purchase which is  considered appropriate to  the  class andcondition of the  land.  Taking as an  illustration land considered  to  be worth 20 years&apos;purchase, if the  annual value untithed is  deemed to be  100&apos; andthe Tithe Rentcharge is  40, then the value of the land tithed anduntithed respectively is taken to be as under :     Untithed :                                                                 100 x 20  ............     ......    2,000    Tithed :        100 -  40  =  60 x 20 -..........    1,200Capital allowance for Tithe Rentcharge  ...     ...     800  But the redemption value of Benefice Tithe Rentcharge, whichis its capital value in the sense  for which the tithe-owner is contending at the present time, is,  owing to the low yield from giltedged  securities, in the  neighbourhood of  1,200.  The general statement. therefore that the capital value of TitheRentcharge is discounted on sale of or succession to land requiressome qualification on this account.  In my  judgment it should also be qualified in the  case of  sales to an  owner-occupier who was  formerly a  tenant  of the  landwhere not infrequently an element of compulsion and  the fear of losing  the value of knowledge of  the land, acquired over more thanone  generation,  obscures  the  effect of Tithe Rentcharge  in theformation by  the purchaser of his judgment as to what he  should pay  for the land.  In view of the extensive changes  which  have taken place inthe ownership of land and particularly the growth of the class of owner-occupier,  these considerations  are  in my judgment  veryrelevant to the  questions of  what is the  stabilised value of TitheRentcharge which  agriculture can afford to  pay and  what  is afair contribution by the  tithe-payer towards the extinguishment of the Rentcharge.
                   Consequential Provisions.  As regards the administrative machinery necessary to give effect-to the foregoing recommendations, I am largely in agreement withthe proposals  put forward by  the Majority of the  Commission inconnection with  the  scheme suggested in  their Report insofar asthose proposals are applicable to the alternative scheme which i recommend.  In  particular I agree that the  powers  of the Redemption Com-missioners should include a personal right of recovery and that theCommissioners should  have a discretion to order compulsory  re-redemption of Tithe Rentcharge  in the circumstances detailed inthe Majority Report.  With regard to the proposal in the Majority  Report to extinguishsmall amounts of  Tithe Rentcharge without compensation in caseswhere the  cost  of apportioning  and collecting the redemptionmoney would  be excessive, I agree that such  powers should only he exercised with the  consent of the Treasury.  In the  case of welsh and Church of England Tithe Rentcharge it  would, in myopinion,  be just that any resultant loss of gross receipts should beborne by the respective funds, but in the case of lay Tithe  Rent-charge dealt with under the  capital scheme  it would, I think,occasion  hardship  if the whole loss were made  to fall on the tithe-owner.   I recommend, therefore, that the Commissioners  shouldhave power in such cases to award compensation to the tithe-ownerup to an amount  not exceeding 50&apos; per cent, of the compensation towhich he would be entitled in normal cases.  On the following points it seems necessary  to make some addi-tional recommendations owing to the divergence of the scheme Ihave  proposed  from that of the  Majority  of  the Commission : 1. Transfer to  the Commissioners of certain portions of the collec-   tion of Tithe Rentcharge.  I consider that it would be desirable for the  Commission to takeover before the appointed day the collection  of the Tithe  Rent-charge owned  by  the  Welsh  Commissioners  and the  Church ofEngland.  In  view of  the  large number  of informal  apportionments  andthe age  of a considerable proportion  of the tithe maps, the taskbefore the Commission of preparing lists which may serve as thebasis for collection by the Inland Revenue  Department is no lightone.  It is believed however that this task would be facilitated by theearly transfer  of Tithe  Rentcharge collection suggested.  The reduction of the  gross annual value of Tithe Rentcharge  andthe extended provisions as to remission would it is hoped go a longway towards removing the cases of hardship with which the presentcollectors have had to  deal.  It would however be  desirable that
the Commissioners should have the same discretion in dealing with cases of hardship as a good landlord exercises in the conduct  ofhis own affairs.2. Functions of  the  Tithe  Redemption Commissioners.  The functions of  the Tithe Redemption Commissioners wouldbe partly judicial and partly administrative, somewhat on the linesof the Special  Commissioners  of  Income  Tax, and  I recommendthat the necessary  powers should be  conferred  on the  Commis-sioners to enable them to function in this manner.   All questionsof fact relating to Tithe Rentcharge  and its extinguishment underthe scheme should be decided by them and  their decision shouldbe final and  legally  binding on all parties concerned subject to  anappeal to the High  Court  on a point of law.  The Commissioners should also be given power, subject to theconsent  of the Treasury,  to borrow in order to finance regularpayments to Ecclesiastical tithe-owners  pending collection fromtithe-payers and the other payments  which they are called upon tomake under  the  scheme.3. Arrears of Tithe  Rentcharge.  There will naturally be a number of cases in which Tithe Rent-charge is in  arrear,  including cases in which an order for recoveryhas  already been made  by the County Court, and it would be amisfortune if the adoption of a  Scheme of  Extinguishment  orthe  prospect of  its  adoption were made  the occasion  of a more stringent attitude by tithe-owners without regard to the financial circumstances of the tithe-payer.   It is probably sufficient to leave it to the good sense of the partiesto  avoid a  situation  of this  sort,  but  should  special  measuresappear to be necessary  I recommend that there should be estab-lished a right of appeal by the tithe-payer to the Redemption Com-missioners, with the consent of  the County  Court, on  grounds of hardship, and  that  the  Commissioners  should have  the  power  to order the recovery, reduction or abandonment of the amount of thearrears.4. Corn Rents and  Extraordinary Tithe Rentcharge.   I  am in agreement with the  Majority of  the Commission thatit would be desirable that these should  be brought within  thegeneral extinguishment  scheme,  but as in the case of Tithe Rent-charge itself I am of opinion that consideration should be given tothe  circumstances of separate classes of owner. i                        ,  Conclusion.   The  surprising thing  about the tithe system in this country ofwhich Tithe Rentcharge is  the present form,  is not that it has prc-provoked recurrent  discontent, but  that it has  endured so long.
 Successive generations have contributed their meed of regulation and pruning, and many times the belief has been expressed that ainal solution of its problems had been achieved; but new conditions have repeatedly created new difficulties and  a sense of  injustice inits incidence. Its long life is perhaps due more to the  fact that its roots arein the parochial  system than to  any  other cause,  and  the realisa-tion of its unsuitability to modern conditions is a further phase inthe development of the functional conception of national organisa-tion. It is not too much to hope therefore that in this generation meanswill be found not merely to amend it but to end it, nor too muchto claim  that the suggested review of its  application is in harmony with the outlook and  spirit of the times. Whilst I  am unable to  agree  that  the State,  which has neverenjoyed  the proceeds of  Tithe  or Tithe Rentcharge,  should becalled upon  to shoulder the main  burden of its extinguishment, andhave  endeavoured to  formulate  proposals for its  extinguishmenton  a self-supporting  basis, it  would  I think be  appropriate and reasonable that the  State  should lend its assistance for the  relief of the poorer clergy during the transitional period of three  years,and  by  providing the cost  of the  Commission  necessary to ad-minister  the Scheme of Extinguishment  and the cost of collectionof the annuities in respect of  Ecclesiastically owned Tithe Rent-charge. In conclusion I desire to associate myself wholeheartedly with theexpression of appreciation contained in the Majority Report of theassistance rendered to the work  of the Commission by our  Secre-tary,  Mr. E. L. Mitchell, C.B.E.,  and  our Assistant Secretary,Mr. A. S. Allen, and to acknowledge my  special obligation to themfor the  knowledge and  statistical ability with which  they haveaided the formulation  of my separate proposals. I also  join with my fellow Commissioners in  expressing deepsorrow at  the death  of  Lord  Cornwallis, and  desire  to  add mytribute of appreciation of  the invaluable service which he renderedthe Commission.  All of  which I humbly submit for Your Majesty&apos;s gracious con-sideration.                                  LEONARD  J.

285uag,8yy,,-,o.fnrPrIncipal Recommendations of Majorlty of the (i) Tithe rentcharge in its present form is to he    abolished at an early dates  and in lieu thereof    tithe-payers of all classes  are to &quot;be allowed to                                               +    extinguish their existing liabilities by 40    annual payments of  91.11so2d.. comparing with a    present liability of either   105 in perpetuity? or     109.10c.0d.  including sinking fund for a period    ending some  75 years hence..(ii) These annuities are to  be collected by the State    (through the Board of Inland Revenue) which in    turn will become responsible for the payment of    interest  and sinking fund on approximately  70    millions  of  a new class  of guaranteed 3 per cento    stock to  be  issued to the present  tithe-owners in    proportion to their present  rights to tithe rent-    charge, which they will  be required to surrender.    Thus9 the tithe-owner will no longer have any    connection,,  direct or indirect 9 with the tithe-    payer^  and will become the holder  of a certain    amount  of guaranteed stock,  which  he will be free    to  sell or dispose of as he  thinks fits  and which    will be as readily marketable as any other Govern-    ment security.*Sir Edward Peacock in his Reservation proposes 50 payments.*The figures relating to  annual.value of tithe rentcharge refer throughout  to tithe rentcharge of the par value of  100 3 and as regards net annual value and futrjfre income rates are taken at  an everage figure of 10s.  in the  .

O.(iii)   The am cant of this stock to be issued to each      titheowner will be the principal amount      required to produce, at 3 per cento  interest,      an income equal to the net annual value of an      assumed tithe rentoharge of  91.11s.2d. gross      (i.e. a rate equal to the proposed new annuity).      The net annual value is arrived at after deduct-      ions for cost of collections land tax, rates      paid, by the tithe owner on the average of the      last three years adjusted on the basis of the      reduced gross annual value, and for improvement      of security, by&apos;reason of the substitution of      a Government guaranteed stock for the present      tithe rentcharge. (iv)   The effect of the  Commission&apos;s proposals on      the income of various classes of titheowners      is given in the Table on page 4 of the Appendix      to CP. 210 (35).    In the case of Queen, Anne&apos;s      Bounty for Benefices (in England) the reduction      of income from tithe rentcharge will  be from       93.15s.0d. (present income) to  76.12s.6d.      (future income) a cut of about IS per cent.  (v)   The interest and sinking fund on the  70      millions of guaranteed stock will not be  fully      covered by the redemption annuities,  even if it      is assumed that these will invariably be  paid      in full, less remissions for which provision is      made in the scheme.    It will be necessary      therefore to balance the account by means of an      Exchequer contribution,  which the Majority      Report estimates  at  approximately  375,000 per
267annum .    To this must &quot;be added the cost of -collection and of the Temporary Commission whichthe Commission propose should he appointed to define the liability of each individual tithe-payingproperty owner in respect of his tithable land.(vi)   The Commission illustrate the financial working of     the scheme as follov/s :-   Expenditure.Interest on  69*908,437 stock at 3 per cent.Sinking fund to redeem above stock in 40 years at 3 per cent,,(Payments and interest[ cn half-yearly basis)income, 2,097.253 Payments from  landowners - Gross        2,838,426 Less Remissions2 200,000  2,638 ,426 say          ________93.5 ,565  Payments .from Treasury 3,012,318   574,592&quot;&apos;&quot; 3,012.818(vii)  As a set-off to the Exchequer contribution of       375,000 per annum for 40 years, and the cost of      collection etc.  the Royal Commission propose to      relieve the Treasury of the contribution which it      now makes from the Consolidated Fund to the rates      on ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge, a liability whii      has averaged approximately  540,000 in the last      three years.   There will, however, be the      contingent liability for the interest and sinking      fund ( 3 millions per annum for 40 years) upon the      Guaranteed Stock.4- If the redemption .annuities are payable for  50 years, as proposed by Sir Edward Peacock,  this figure will become   70,000.x The Commission propose that in any case in which  the annuity in any year exceeds one-third of the  Schedule 33. value of an agricultural holding  the excess amount should not be payable or  recoverable.If the redemption annuities are payable for50 years, as proposed by Sir Edward Peacock,this figure will become  70,000.
