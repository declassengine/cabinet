SURVEY  OF  THE  ECONOMIC  SITUATION,  FEBRUARY  1936                Part  1. Summary of recent economic  events                                (a) Financial.    DURING the second half of 1935 sterling  has shown only comparatively minor fluctuations in relation to the principal gold currencies, in spite of periods of considerable disturbance in the foreign  exchange market.    In Septembersterling was subject to pressure,  partly because  of  the  international situation,partly  because of the movement  of European  capital to the United States toparticipate  in the  revival of activity  on  the New  York Stock  Exchange.   InNovember a critical situation again developed in France, and the Bank of Francelost gold on a substantial scale,  though not to the  same extent  as  during the crisis of last May. The French bank rate was raised by stages from 3 per cent., towhich it had been reduced in August, to 6 per cent.,  though by the beginning ofFebruary 1936 it was Lowered again to 3^ per cent. Towards the end of January,anxieties regarding the budgetary situation in the United States  were increasedby the passage of the Veterans&apos; Bonus Bill, and a substantial outward movementof funds occurred, which carried the dollar-franc exchange to a point at which it became profitable to export gold to France.  Movements of the London exchange rates on New York and Paris are given  in table 1.TABLE 1.Average of mean London daily rates of exchange in 1934 and 1935.On New York.Dollars to  .On Paris.Francs to k.FebruaryMarch ...AprilMayJuneJ ulyAugust ...SeptemberOctober...NovemberDecemberJanuary1934.5-0395-0935-1555-1065-0505-0435-0674-9964-9424-9904-9461935.4-8951935.4-8754-7774-8364-8914-937 -957 -971 -933 -909 -926 -9291936.4-956 1934.77-7977-3877-9177-2176-5176-4676-OS74-8674-5775-7474-981935.74-361935.73-72-931473-2874-2474-6874-8275-0274-8574-4974-7874-691936.74-85    In  table  2 exchange  rates  are compared with  those  which  should haveprevailed on the  basis of the price  of gold in these centres, and the table thusgives  some  indication of the direction and  force  of  the movements  of fundsOccurring at these rates of exchange.

The gold holdings of the principal central banks since March 1934 are shown in the following table.  The most noticeable features during  the  second half of 1935 were the continuous growth of American  gold  reserves, the rapiddiminution of Italian reserves, and the loss of gold by the  Bank of France inNovember.  Dutch gold reserves were seriously depleted in the third  quarter ofthe year,  but subsequently recovered.                                   TABLE 3.

     3.  In both September and October, on balance, gold to the value of approxi-mately  7-1 millions was exported from  this country.  In November, in spiteof the crisis which developed in Paris, the net imports of gold into this countryamounted only to^3^ millions.   The significance  of these figures is obscured bythe practice  that has  grown up by which central banks and exchange control authorities carry stocks of gold in centres other  than  that from which they are operating. During November gold to the value of  4 millions was exported fromthis country to Holland.     4.  At  the  beginning  of  November, radical changes were  made in the monetary and banking policy of China.  Debts  due in terms of silver are, infuture, to be settled in notes,  which are made  full legal tender.  Hoards and reserves of silver are to be exchanged for notes,  and in future the hoarding of silver and its use as currency are to be serious offences.  The private  note issues of the Commercial banks are to be gradually redeemed, and the right of  noteissue is to be confined  to government banks.  The government intends to buy orsell foreign exchange in unlimited amounts at a fixed price.   It intends  to use the silver nationalised under the  scheme  as  a means  of  acquiring the reserves of foreign currencies which  will be necessary if it is to carry out this policy.If this new policy is  to be carried to a successful conclusion,  not only will theChinese  government  have  to   overcome  the  grave  administrative problemsattaching to the nationalisation of silver,  but will also have to find a  market forthis silver abroad. At the moment the only purchaser of silver in world marketsis the American treasury, which is virtually in  a position to  dictate the price at which  it will buy.  During  the first  half of  1935 it was the policy of theAmerican Treasury to force up the price of silver, which rose from approximately two shillings an ounce in January to three shillings an  ounce at the end of April.From July to November the price of  silver  was maintained  fairly  steadily at between 2s. Qd. and 2s. 5d.  an ounce.  In December, however, the AmericanTreasury  apparently  decided to reverse  its  previous  policy,  and the  price of silver has been  allowed to fall  to below  two shillings an ounce.   This suddenchange in policy caused considerable disturbance in the silver markets, both inLondon and Bombay.  The American  Government has announced its intentionof buying silver in other markets than London, and it may be that it is understoodthat it has already made purchases  to the amount of  100,000,000 ounces  direct from the  Chinese Government.  At the same time it has allowed the price of silver-in the open market to fall, so that the incentive to  smuggling may be reduced.    5. The principal event in the London money market during recent months has been  the issue by the government of two new  loans.  The nominal amount ofthe first,  a one per cent, bond redeemable in 1939 to 1941, issued at a price of98 per cent., was   100 millions.   That  of the second, a 2\ per cent. FundingLoan, redeemable in 1956-61,  issued at a price of 96-1 Per cent., was  200 millions.The proceeds of these issues, amounting to  291  millions are  to be used first to redeem the  44 millions outstanding of 3 per cent. Treasury  bonds which havebeen called for redemption on the 15th April next, and secondly to redeem the 150 millions of 2 per cent.  Treasury bonds called for redemption next March.The balance of  97 millions will be available to reduce the floating debt.  It may be-recalled that when in April 1935, half of the then  outstanding issue of 3 per cent.Treasury  bonds  was redeemed,  the floating debt was increased by  44 millions..The net effect of the two operations of April and December is to reduce the floatingdebt by  53 millions,  to  reduce the outstanding issues  of Treasury bonds by 138 millions and to increase the medium term debt by  200 millions.   It  willbe observed that the effect of these issues  and redemptions will ultimately be toreduce the supply of securities in  which the money market is in the habit ofinvesting, by  188 millions.   In view, however, of the fact that a large part ofthe issue of the Funding Loan  was apparently taken up by government depart-ments, who may finance their purchases by reducing their holdings of treasury bills and bonds,  it may be some time before there is any reduction in the volumeof investment financed by the money market.    6. Bank deposits continue to increase, and reached in  December  2,091millions, which is  2 millions  greater than  in November and  120 millions greaterthan in December 1934.  The different assets held by  the banks have increased since December 1934 by  the following amounts, cash by  5 millions, money

The prices of gilt-edged securities fell from May to October,  by which time they were not substantially higher than  a year  previously.   In november and December there was a recovery and by the end of the year the yield obtainableon 2-1 per cent, consols was approximately 2-9 per cent, compared with 2-7 per^ent. at the end of last  year when government securities were at their  highestprice.  Ordinary shares on the other hand, in spite of setbacks in February, andin August and September were substantially higher at the end of 1935 than atthe end of 1934, though the yield obtainable on ordinary shares, at 3-7 per cent.,*was practically  the same as in the previous year.  Compared  with a year ago the general level of interest rates has  risen slightly,  but the greater dividendsnow being paid  on ordinary  shares and the prospect of still higher dividends inthe future, have, in spite of this, brought about an upward movement in ordinaryshare prices.  It may be observed that calculated on  the basis of earnings andnot of dividends, the  yield on ordinary shares is to-day substantially higher thana year ago.                     * As calculated by the Institute of Actuaries.at call by  8 millions, Bills discounted by  67 millions, advances by  25 millions and investments by  11  millions.    Compared Avith 1934 the floating  debt  isonly  9 millions higher, but issues to the market have increased by  116 millions,and issues to public departments have decreased by  107 millions.  The increase inbank deposits must in some measure be  attributed to this increase in the issues of  treasury  bills to the market.   It remains to  be seen whether the  fundingoperations which we  have described in paragraph 5 above, will have a contraryeffect.

The commodities which show substantial. rises compared with a year ago are wheat,  butter, potatoes and  sugai among food-stuffs, pig-iron, certain, steel products,  copper, brass, lead and zinc among metals, wool, hemp,  jute, vegetable oils and hides.   Meat prices  are  generally lower than a year ago.  Barley  and maize have also fallen in price.   It may be observed that  those  food-stuffs  which have  risen in  price have generally been subject to some special influence, e.g., the after-effects of  the drought of 1934; and that those industrial materials which have not risen in price in 1935, notably cotton, rubber  and tin had risen very considerably  in the previous year thaniks to the working of restriction  schemes.   The underlying  tendency appears to be for  the prices of industrial materials to  rise, and for those of food-stuffs to remain stationary.  This tendency is probably connected with the fact that world trade  in raw materials has  shown a material recovery since the worst point of the depression whereas the trade in food-stuffs has  shown none.  United States- prices have  advanced further  in 1935, but have been, on the whole, more  stable than in 1934.  French prices were substantially lower in 1935 than in 1934.  They reached their lowest point in July, and have subsequently risen to the level of the beginning of 1935, under the influence  of higher  wheat prices  due  to a short harvest.   German prices are rising, but little reliance can be placed on the official indices.                             (b)  United Kingdom.     9.

Since  September the number of insured persons aged 16  to 64has increased abnormally rapidly,  reflecting the period of  abnormally heavybirths just after the war.  In so far as  the number of juveniles reaching the ageof 16  who were previously  in employment was not offset by the number of juvenilesunder 16 being employed for the first time, the increase in employment shown inthe preceding table, slightly exaggerates the true improvement in the employment situation.  Unemployment among  insured  persons  in December  amounted to1,858,000, compared with  2,021,000 in December 1934.   In January employmentfell to 10,349,000 and our index would  have fallen to  106-3.  The  falling-off inemployment is apparently  largely due to  bad weather affecting the building trades,hut it may be expected that with the settlement of the coal dispute the improve-ment  of employment in that industry during the last few months will come  to anend.    10.  Production, according to the Board of Trade index, in the third  quarterof 1935, at 110-8 per cent, of the 1930 level, was over 7 per cent, greater  than inthe same quarter of 1934.   The increase between the second quarters of 1934 and1935 was somewhat smaller.  The Board of Trade index for the fourth  quarteris not yet available, but the index of the London and Cambridge Economic  Service,which is not equally comprehensive, increased by nearly 11 per cent, between thefourth quarter of 1934 and that of 1935.

The increase is more markedin the case of other buildings than in the case of houses.   In the half-year ending the 30th  September, 1935, 148,600 houses  were completed in England and &quot;Wales,compared with 167,800 in the preceding  half-year and  160,100 in the half-year ending the 30th September, 1934.  Thus, although the value of  building planspassed by the 146 local authorities increased in that period, the number of housesactually completed in England and Wales diminished.    12.  Steel production in Great Britain was very satisfactory in the second half of 1935, and the output of steel in  1935 was the greatest ever  recorded inthis country.  During the second half of the  year the  internal consumption ofsteel showed a considerable expansion, being on the average 103,000 tons a monthgreater than in 1934, compared with an  average increase of 17,000  tons in thefirst half. It is said that the industry is now nearing its full capacity to produce.    11.

Retail trade, like the other main branches of economic activity, appearsto be making consistent progress.  The index of retail sales has not been inexistence in its present form long enough for the effects of normal seasonal move-ments to be allowed for with any precision.  But  it appears likely that the levelof retail sales was between 3 and 4 per cent, higher in the second half of  1935 thanin the first half, and between 6 and 7 per cent, higher than in  the second half of1934.  To some extent this increase is attributable to a rise in the retail costs of foodstuffs, which, again allowing for seasonal changes, were perhaps 2\ per cent.higher on the average than in the two preceding half-years.                              TABLE 11.Value of average daily retail sales in Great Britain reported to the Bank of                          England since 1932.(average for the year 1933 = 100.)Month.	1932.	19 S3.	193 A-	1935.J anuary	104	97	101	105February ...	91	88	91	95March ...	97	94	99	100April	104	104	101	111May	105	100	108	110June	100	-101	103	109July	100	99	102	109August	86	86	90	94September ...	94	93	97	104October	101	102	105	113November ...	101	104	108	115December ...	126	131	134	146Year ...	101	100	103	109Consumption of steel in Great Britain.

The improved state of general confidence which has been noticeable forsome time in the United States has recently been reflected in a general rise in theprincipal business indices.   Between  September  and  October  the  index  ofindustrial production published by the Board of Governors of the Federal ReserveSystem increased from 89 per cent, of the average for the years 1923 to 1925 to96 per cent., and remained at  that level in November.  The  outstanding  increase was in the  motor industry, which had  recently been affected by the  ordinaryseasonal slackness, but there were substantial improvements in a number  of otherindustries.  Factory employment has also expanded, though, as the index is more fully representative, not in the same proportion.  Compared with  a year ago thegreatest improvements in employment took place in the industries producing ironand steel, machinery, vehicles, non-ferrous metals and timber.  There  was alsoa substantial improvement in  employment in the building material industries.Most industries  producing  goods for  current  consumption also showed  animprovement in employment,  but the  important group of  food industries wasemploying fewer persons in November  1935 than in 1934.   Retail  trade  also has reached  a substantially higher level than a year ago, though sales  of groceriesappear to be lower than last year.TABLE 12.Production, employment and retail trade in the United States in 1934 and 1935.

Since  the second  quarter  of 1935,  American  residential buildingactivity  appears  to  have   experienced  a   material  improvement.    this improvement has not been of sufficient importance to bring the total of construc-tional  contracts awarded in 1935 much above the total for  the previous year,for, in the  early parts of the year, the contracts  awarded in other sections of thebuilding trade were materially lower than in 1934.  It is,  however, an encouragingindication  that, thanks to  the growth of general prosperity  and the  normalincrease of population, the surplus of housing accommodation, which appearedafter  the  constructional boom of 1922  to  1929,  is now disappearing.   In  thefollowing table we give particulars of the value of contracts for constructionalwork awarded in 37 eastern states.

The revival in the demand for motor cars played an important part in american recovery in 1935. The average monthly registrations of new passengercars rose from 158 thousand in the first nine months of 1934 to 238 thousand inthe first nine months of 1935,  and the production  of passenger cars rose corres-correspondingly.   The  outlook for the motor  trade in.  1936 must, of course, dependprincipally on  the degree of prosperity experienced in that year.  But  there arecertain considerations which suggest that, other things being equal, 1936 shouldNew York Times Index of Business Activity.           (Percentage of  normal.)
prove a more satisfactory year than  1935.  Between 1929  and 1932  the  totalnumber of passenger cars registered in the United States fell from 23,122,000to 20,903,000;  but in  this period  the registrations of new  motor  vehicles,together with the reduction in the total number of cars in use, were more thansufficient to off-set the cars which would normally have fallen out of use throughold age.  In 1933 and 1934, however, this tendency appears to have been reversed.In 1933 the reduction in the total number of vehicles registered almost came toan end, and from 1934 onwards we may assume, in view of  the improvement in economic conditions, that there was no further  reduction.  It  appears  that newregistrations in the years 1933 and 1934 would not normally have been sufficient tomaintain the numbers of cars on  the road, and  that there was,  consequently, agreat increase in the number of old cars on the road.   The increase in the numberof old cars on the road in 1933 to  1934 was very much greater  than the decreasein the period 1929 to 1932. In 1935 new registrations appear to have been nearlyequal to the number of cars which  would normally have fallen out of use throughold age.  It thus appears that the improvement in car production in 1935 is to be accounted for by the fact that in that year the two influences which in turndepressed production from 1930 to 1934 ceased to operate.  The total number of cars  in use was no longer falling, and the number of old  cars on the road was nolonger  increasing.  In 1936 the production of new cars is likely to be assisted bythe fact that the large numbers of  cars produced in 1928  and 1929 will be fallingdue  for replacement.  Moreover, any improvement in prosperity is likely  to be accompanied by  a reduction in the number of old  cars on the road, and an increasein the total number of cars registered.   Further, it is generally anticipated thata substantial part of the funds made available under  the recent Veterans&apos; BonusAct  will be expended on the purchase of motor cars.   It may be observed that for;some time the value of second-hand cars appears to have been rising.   In 1933the average value of second-hand cars sold  through finance companies amountedto $221, and it remained at this level in the first part of 1934.  During the second half of 1934 it rose from $226 in June to $234 in December.  In 1935  the  valuecontinued to rise, reaching $248 in November,  since which  time there has beena fall.   In the following table we give the number of new registrations, and oftotal registrations in the United  States since 1928.   &quot;We also give an estimateof the replacements necessary to maintain the number of cars on the road.*From these figures we are able to deduce the surplus  or deficiency of old cars onthe road compared with 1927.

During 1935  the  American wage level  showed  a slowly increasingtendency.   Retail food prices rose fairly considerably as a consequence of the drought in the previous year.   Retail prices of other goods were lower in themiddle of the year, no doubt as the result of some deficiency of demand following the higher prices paid for food-stuffs.  Recently the prices of these goods have
been rising.   The value of  sterling has not fluctuated greatly, and the more-satisfactory relationship between the  level American costs  and  of sterlingestablished towards the end of 1934 appears to have been maintained.

The year 1935 was noteworthy as the year in which the prices of farm products and food regained equilibrium with the prices of industrial and miningproducts after the great relative fall in their value which occurred in the first period of the  depression.

We reproduce the following table from the bulletin issued by the boardof governors of the Federal Reserve System. It gives an account of the receipts andexpenditures of the Federal Government during the four  complete years ending the 30th June, 1935, and during the four months July to October 1935.  It willbe observed  that  since June 1931  the  accumulated deficit  of the  Americantreasury amounts to  13,103  million  dollars.   Of this  deficit a  substantial proportion has been  incurred in the acquisition of assets  which may  ultimatelyprove to be of value.   Though in this period the capital of the public debt hasincreased  from 16,801  million dollars on the  30th June, 1931, to 29,462 million dollars at  the end of October 1935, the interest charges have not  increased in thesame proportion.  In the year ending the 30th June, 1931, these charges amountedto $612 million; in the year ending the 30th June, 1935, to $821 million.  Eventhe last of these figures was smaller than that  for charges incurred in the year ending the 30th June, 1926, and previous years.  In addition to the expendituresgiven in the table the Federal government has to meet  sinking fund chargesamounting to between 500 and  600 million  dollars annually, out of ordinaryrevenue.   In recent years  these charges have  been offset by the creation  of newdebts.       [12653]                                                      D

    22.  The growth of the United States government debt is illustrated in thefollowing table compiled from the same source.  Changes in the size of the grossdebt alone do not afford any real clue to the excess of expenditure over receipts.In the first place the United States treasury holds very considerable funds in theform  of deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank and other banks of the reservesystem, the size of which has varied considerably in the last three years. Moreover,during the years 1933-34  and 1934-35 the treasury received  substantial sumsfrom  more or less adventitious  sources, notably from  the devaluation of the dollar.  Taking the three years from  July 1932  to  June 1935, these  abnormalreceipts are,  in fact, approximately balanced by the increase in treasury funds :but the increase in the latter did not  take place at the time  when the benefitof the former was being felt by the treasury.  If it had not been for these factorsthe debt would possibly have increased less rapidly in the first half of 1934 andmore  rapidly in the second half.   Another factor, of even greater importance,has been the extent to which the funds used to finance  the governmental creditagencies  have been  drawn directly from  the  treasury  or  have been raised by government guaranteed  borrowing  without  passing  through  the  treasury.  Alarge  proportion of these funds will eventually prove recoverable, and in so faras they are included in current  expenditure they tend to exaggerate the size ofthe deficit and of the burden which the United States taxpayer will ultimately be called on to bear.  In the following table we have given figures indicating theextent to  which the increase in  the government debt has  been exaggerated byexpenditure of this character.  Up  to June 1934 the only figures available arethe outstanding loans and purchases of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation,from  which  we have  deducted  the issues of  securities, bearing a government guarantee, by the corporation to the public.  From July 1934  onwards  a tablehas been published monthly, showing the interest of the government in the excessof assets over liabilities of all government refinancing agencies.  The  differencebetween these two figures, on the one hand, and the gross debt on the other hand,gives  the  debt of  the government incurred from an excess  of non-recoverableexpenditure over normal receipts,  subject to the qualifications made earlier inthis paragraph. This difference is given in the penultimate column of the table.The gross figure of the public debt does not include the issues of securities bearing the full guarantee  of  the government,  by the  refinancing agencies.   The totalsof these are  given  in  the table, and the sum  of these issues together with theordinary  public debt,  which represents  the  total  federal  government issuesoutstanding,  is given in the last column.

The size of the American public debt is very moderate according toBritish standards,  having regard  to  the  aggregate  of incomes  earned in theUnited States compared with those earned in Great Britain.   Even in 1934 thetotal value of these incomes amounted to nearly  10,000 millions in  the UnitedStates,  whereas  the  annual  cost  of  the public debt (excluding  redemption)amounted to about   170 millions.  The corresponding figures for Great britain were between  3,500 and  4,000 millions in the case of incomes and approximately 210 millions for the cost of the national debt.  The  outstanding debts of theStates and local authorities per head in  the United States is  roughly similar tothe corresponding figure in this country.    24.  President  Roosevelt&apos;s  budget   message for  the  year  ending  the30th June, 1937, anticipates that normal receipts, including therein those  fromthe processing taxes,  which have recently  been  declared unconstitutional, to theamount  of  $547 millions will amount  to $5,654 millions;   and that normalexpenditures including  therein  statutory debt retirements  to  the  amount  of$580 millions and expenditure under the  unconstitutional Agricultural Adjust-ment Act to the amount of $619 millions will amount to $5,649 millions leaving a surplus of $5 millions.  In addition there will be  unspecified expenditure onrelief and recovery, for which purposes unutilised appropriations to  the amountof $1,103 millions are in existence. No announcement has yet been  made  as to public debt of the United States Government.

In the second half of 1935 there was a slight improvement in Frenchconditions, observable both in the index of production and in that of employ-ment.  This improvement was probably fully accounted for by  the  relaxation of the acute financial embarrassment which characterised the early summer oflast year, and did not reflect any improvement in the state of confidence.   bank rate  was reduced from 6 per cent,  in May to  3 per cent, in August.  Since-November conditions of financial stringency nave reasserted themselves.  The bank rate  was raised to  6  per cent, in November and  stands to-day  at 4 per  cent.The effect of these disturbances has not yet appeared in the indices of productionand employment so  far published.

               Part 2. The economic situation, February 1936.                            (a) Recovery policies.    33.  Over the greater part of the world recovery from  the late depressionnow appears to be established  on  a. comparatively stable basis.  That is to say,there is to-day very much less fear that minor interferences with the developmentof economic activity will bring about a relapse into the vicious circles of depressionfrom  which one country after  another has so painfully extricated itself.  It istrue,  indeed, that certain important countries still remain in  a very depressedcondition. - There has been no alleviation of the situation in France and the otherremaining  members  of  the gold bloc&apos;, and China is in the throes of a serious financial crisis.   But in these cases  the prolongation of the depression may be attributed either to exceptional misfortune or to exceptional perversity.    34.  But if there has been a widespread improvement in economic conditions,this is not because  the  different countries of the world have at last  achieved a stable equilibrium.   In a number  of countries the revival in  internal activity is dependent, to  a dangerous  extent,  on temporary  expenditure,  financed  from government borrowing, which if  it is continued indefinitely, must  inevitablyconstitute a serious threat to the stability of the credit structure.  Moreover, inmany  cases  the expansion  of  activity  which  has  come  about,   has  beenpreclominantly in the internal market.   This is a common  observation in  thecase of the United  Kingdom.   It  is even more obviously true in the  case ofGermany.  It is true, though in a lesser degree, of the United States,  where  thevolume of internal production has recovered to about 90 per cent, of the level of1923  to 1925, whereas  the volume of exports in the  first nine months of 1935amounts to only 70 per cent, of the average volume over the same period.    35.  We  revert to the consideration of the difficulties  in the way of   an expansion  of world  trade at the  close of this report, and we turn  first to  an examination  of  the problems which have faced the different governments of  theworld in their attempts to deal with the internal forces  of  depression.  Thereis one respect in which  these have borne a marked similarity to one another.   Inevery country during the period of  depression,  the  normal course of economic activity was  interrupted  by the widespread fear of insolvency.  It has been byallaying these  fears, at least in so  far  as they relate to domestic debts, that governments  have succeeded in promoting internal recovery, and it  is largely because in  the international sphere these fears are still alive, that the recovery of world trade has made such relatively small progress.    36.  It is customary to explain the  prevalence of insolvency in times of depression by  reference  to  the fall  of  the  general  price  level  which almostinvariably  accompanies it.  Broadly speaking,  this  explanation  is,  no doubt,satisfactory,  but for our present purposes it is useful to reconstruct the chain ofcausation in greater detail.  In the succeeding paragraphs, therefore, we discusssome  of the problems of the late depression and the recovery from  it, in a ratherabstract manner.  We  resume our  discussion- on  a less  theoretical plane  at paragraph 48.  The ideas which we develop  in the  intervening  paragraphsprovide a  background  against which recent financial events stand  out  more clearly, but they are not essential to the development  of the  argument in  theremainder  of our report.   We wish  also to emphasise that in these paragraphswe are  not attempting  to give a complete account of the  various  factors whichcontribute  to a depression of trade, but rather to  deal  in  isolation with  the monetary disturbances which are a feature of such depressions.    37.  The assets against which debts are secured are naturally of avery different character from those goods which enter into the flow of currently produced income,whose price changes are measured by the normal price indices.   It is thus  quite possible for a fall in the general price level to take place without a  correspondingfall in the value of assets against which debts have been incurred,  provided thatthere is a change in the basis upon which the earning power of capital goods istranslated  into terms of present value.   In other words, so long as  there is a  fallin the rate of interest,  large enough to offset the reduced profits,  entailed by a fall in the  general price level unaccompanied by a corresponding fall, in the costs
of production, there is no reason why the value of capital assets should decline tosuch an extent as to bring about a general condition of insolvency.    38.  In  fact,  however, the  long-term rate  of interest, represented,  forexample, by the yield on long-term securities issued by the government and otherborrowers of undoubted solvency, does not respond readily to comparatively short period fluctuations in the yield on invested capital.  If the price of these securitiesrises  substantially  above that  which,  taking a  long view, seems likely to bemaintained, investors  tend  to sell their long dated securities, and either to  buyshort dated securities whose capital value is protected, or to hold their capital inthe form of deposits at  the bank,  cash  itself,  or  even, if the exchange value ofthe domestic currency becomes suspect, in the form of gold.   Thus, if the fluctua-tions  in the earning power of invested capital are  considerable the correspondingfluctuations in  the yield of long-term  securities  are  not  sufficient to preserveequilibrium.  It becomes more  profitable to hold  capital either in the form of securities bringing  in  a fixed money income or in  short-term securities, the valueof which is protected, than to invest it in productive assets, and the value of these assets is thereby forced down below their cost of production.    39.  In  these,  circumstances  two  phenomena characteristic  of  periods of depression  make their appearance.  In the first place, capital construction falls.off; for it is obvious that no one  will willingly produce for a market in whichgoods can only be sold at a loss.  But to&quot; a large extent the  monetary saving outof which this capital  construction was previously financed continues.   For  notonly is the long period rate of interest  on which depends the ultimate equilibriumbetween saving and investment, maintained above the appropriate level; but  also for some while this rate of saving is under the influence of contracts previouslyentered into.   There thus  arises  a deficiency of  purchasing power  which  canonly be made good by the dissipation  of savings by those whose incomes  arepeculiarly  affected  by the depression, and whose expenditure cannot be corres-correspondingly diminished.  And the general level of  economic activity is inevitablyreduced  until  this involuntary  dissipation  of  capital  equals   the  excess of ordinary saving over the value of  current investment.    40.  Secondly,  the fall  in the value of invested assets leads  at once to theinsolvency of some borrowers, and leads many more to fear  insolvency.  In thesecircumstances both  borrowers and lenders are anxious to increase  their holdings of cash or short-term securities readily convertible  into cash, the borrowers in.order that they  may be in  a  position to meet their maturing obligations,  thelenders because  they are unwilling to  renew their advances  as they are paid off.There thus arises a preference to hold cash or its equivalent in the place of other assets, which further depresses the price of the latter.    41.  The two processes  which are outlined in the preceding paragraphs actand react on one another.   The fall in prices brought about by a general fearof insolvency makes capital  construction all the more unprofitable.  The falling off in the employment of capital and labour  in the  constructional trades reactsthe more seriously  on the level of consumption  because, so long as the pricesreceivable for capital  assets sold  are  low, those whose  incomes are particularly affected by the  depression  are unwilling to  supplement  their expenditure  outof the sale of such assets.   And the reduced level of general economic  activityprevents the absence of new capital construction  from having its natural effectof creating a shortage of capital goods.  The vicious circle is thus complete.    42.  Even if there is no intervention on the part of the monetary authorities,the deflationary process will no doubt eventually come to an end.  Sooner or later, in the absence of capital construction, a shortage of productive equipmentmust  develop; and sooner or later  the volume of indebtedness must be so reducedby bankruptcies, liquidations and  the  transference of real assets from debtors tocreditors on terms highly favourable to the latter, that the fears of insolvency nolonger oppress  the capital market.  But the economic life of a modern statemight descend to unexampled levels of depression  if it were not for the  supportof  the  government  and the monetary  authorities which  is  almost  invariablyforthcoming.    43.  Effective intervention by the government and the monetary authorities may take two forms.  The first, which because it has the  countenance  of past       [12653]                                                      E 2
 practice, may be called the orthodox remedy, is to extend the supply of money, in its widest sense during the  period of  depression.   We have seen that the effect of the  disorganisation in the normal relationships between the  different  classes of capital assets in time of depression is  to set up a strong demand for assets readily  convertible into cash at their face value,  such as bank deposits and comparatively short-term government securities,  and that this  demand arises from two quarters, from those who hold that long-term securities are overvalued at their depression levels, and from those who wish to prepare in advance for the repayment of debts as they fall due.  It is this preference for a particular class of capital asset which  has  the  effect  of  depressing the price of other capital assets.   But this depressing effect can be avoided if the supply of short-period obligations is extended to meet the new demand. Moreover, so long as there is a. ready sale for capital assets, those whose  income is most heavily curtailed  by the depression are  likely to maintain their expenditure by the sale of such assets, and thus to offset the surplus  of ordinary saving over current investment which, as we have seen in paragraph 39 above, must otherwise  have a depressing effect on the level of business  activity.   If the general level of expenditure in times of depression is by these means comparatively well maintained, the absence of new capital construction  and replacement must soon have the effect of producing a shortage of  productive  equipment; the earning power of  this equipment must rise; and the divergence between the yield  on capital invested in equipment and that invested in securities yielding a fixed money  income must disappear.  And when these two yields are again in equilibrium, the vicious  circle is broken.     44.   Secondly, the government may itself  support the  level  of consumption by allowing its expenditure to outrun its receipts. In this way the surplus savings of those classes who are least affected by the depression are redirected back into the field of consumption, and the evil consequences arising from a deficiency in the demand for consumable goods are  avoided.   It  should be observed that the effectiveness  of this  remedy  is very much  diminished if  the new government borrowing necessary to  finance the deficit  created takes the form of long-term loans.  For the issue of these tends to maintain the yield obtainable on securities offering a fixed money income, and thus accentuates the divergence between the yield from these  securities  and from capital invested in productive assets. Moreover, the practical effectiveness of this instrument is lessened by  its lack of adaptability.  Both the receipts and the payments of  governments are determined by considerations of  long-term policy which cannot  lightly be set  aside to deal with a temporary emergency.  It has thus often come about that a deficit on the national budget has appeared rather as  the effect of a depression than as an act of policy, and in these circumstances a deficit is no  remedy at all.  The spectacle of a government attempting,  in the face of growing difficulties, to maintain budgetary equilibrium has in these circumstances generally served further to confuse the public mind  at a time when  the restoration  of confidence is of  supreme national importance.  For  these reasons  the growth of budgetary deficits during the present depression  have  not in many cases been  attended with the success which on theoretical grounds one would have expected. But this experience should not be allowed to obscure the advantages which may be derived from a  temporary relaxation of the strict principles of budgetary equilibrium as  a part of a well- considered  policy  directed  towards  the  stabilisation  of internal  economic conditions.     45.   We have  conducted the preceding analysis in terms of the  conditions prevailing in times of depression.  But  it  is applicable, mutatis  mutandis, to times of boom.   Just as depressions are characterised by a reduction in the yield obtainable from the  investment  of capital in productive assets below  thatobtainable on securities providing a fixed money income, so in times of boom the reverse  is the  case, and the opposite  effects appear.   Capital construction is stimulated beyond the level which is appropriate having regard to the long-period factors at work; debts are incurred freely, and the whole structure of indebtednessis extended beyond the margin of  safety;  particular classes of the communitysecure exceptional  profits.  There  is an  essential  instability  in  the prosperityexperienced in these  periods, for  it is  based on a level  of  capital construction which cannot be maintained  indefinitely.    Sooner  or later,  a condition of over-supply of productive equipment appears, the yield on this form of capital declinesand. the conditions associated with the onset of a  depression are  established.
Thus, by an analogous process of reasoning to that by which an extension of the-supply of money and its equivalents is justified in times of depression, a reductionof this supply in times of boom is also justified.  Moreover, there is at these timesa- similar justification for a policy of budgetary surpluses.     46.   The instruments of government policy which we have discussed in thepreceding paragraphs are those by which the financial organisation of the modernstate can be preserved in comparative stability.  We do not  wish to  suggest thatstability of this kind is all that is necessary to maintain the productive resourcesof the community in full employment.   A large part of unemployment, in times of depression as well as in times of prosperity,  is due to the maldistribution ofthese resources between  different  uses, too  many being concentrated in some industries,  and too  few in others.   The re-employment of these resources must depend for the most part on the slow process of physical transfer. And though therate of transference is accelerated when trade is  good, it is dependent on so many other factors, that some unemployment of this kind appears  to be inevitable even under the most satisfactory financial conditions.     47.  We have seen that the preservation of financial equilibrium requires a readiness to expand and  contract the supply of those obligations which in come degree fulfill  the  purposes of money in accordance  with variations in demand.This expansion is  brought about in one of two ways.  On the one hand the public debt may be unfunded by issuing short-dated, for the repurchase of long-datedloans;  or, alternatively, the same result may be achieved by inducing the bankingsystem  to  increase its holding of  long-dated securities  by  purchases from thepublic, who are thus enabled to increase their bank deposits.  On the other hand,new short-dated debts may be incurred to finance a current deficit.  Now it isreadily seen that whereas the  first of these  processes is  easily  reversible  asconditions change, the same will only be true of the second if the deficit which thenew debts are being used to finance is itself  likely to  disappear at the rightmoment.   If,  however,   the  deficit  has  been  incurred by undertaking  new expenditure which will continue even  in times of normal prosperity, and if  no-suitable provision has been made for financing this  expenditure, the responsibleauthorities are obviously likely to  have  greater difficulty  in  preventing  an.undesirable extension of private  indebtedness as conditions improve.     48.   The United States, being the most  advanced industrial country in theworld, is remarkable for the high proportion of its total productive activity, whichis devoted to the construction and maintenance of goods of a durable nature.*The price which she pays for the perfection of her capital equipment is exposureto more than ordinarily severe periods of economic depression.  We have discussed in the preceding paragraphs the very fallible mechanism whereby the output of productive  equipment  is kept more or less  in step with the general trend ofeconomic activity, and it is only to be expected that where the relative importance-of this output is great, the periodic failure of this mechanism should lead toparticularly severe disorganisation. Moreover, the great  development in Americaof a comparatively new form of capital investment, the financing of the purchaseof consumption goods of a more or  less permanent nature has added materially tothis instability, both by accelerating the pace at  which a new demand may besatisfied,  and by increasing the contractual element of saving which  is prolongedunduly in times of depression, long  after the productive activity to which it relateshas  ceased.     49.   The decade which ended in 1930 was for  a number of reasons one inwhich the  extension and improvement of capital equipment took  place on  a tremendous  scale.  For  one thing it was   a period  of  rapidly expandingpopulation, the absolute increase in the United States population being greater    * The importance of the production of durable goods in the United States may be judged from the annual consumption of steel per thousand of population.   For the period 1928 to.1932 this was as follows: (b)  The United States of America.United KingdomGermanyUnited States ...144 tons.128 ,,295 ,,
than in any preceding decade, though, of course, the rate of increase was much smaller than in the nineteenth  century.   Secondly, it was a  period  when thetechnical  exploitation  of  two  nineteenth  century  inventions,  the  internalcombustion engine and the electric motor, entered upon its most vigorous phase.Finally, the  general  improvement  in the standard  of living which technicalprogress made  possible  brought with  it a  demand  for  improved housing accommodation, as well as for greater facilities in other but perhaps less importantdirections.  The great extension in the demand for new capital equipment arisingfrom  these quarters could  be all the more  rapidly  satisfied by  reason  of theexpansion in the capacity of the capital-producing industries which had beenbrought about during the war.  In these circumstances it was only natural thatthe rate of output of capital goods should have much exceeded that  which, inthe long run, was required to maintain American economic life in equilibrium.    50.  Towards the end of the decade, signs  began to appear that the demandfor new capital equipment was approaching saturation.  Building output reached its maximum in 1928, that of machinery and motor cars in 1929.   The extensionof the power equipment of electrical generating stations continued through 1930,but thereafter ceased almost entirely. Investment in new capital equipment hadbeen pushed  to a point at which it no longer  yielded an adequate return, and prosperity gave way to depression.    51.  We do not need to  traverse the history of the recent financial depressionin the States.  The feature of this depression which we wish to emphasise is theunprecedented falling off in  the output of capital goods.  For example, the  outputof steel and  of motor cars  in the three years  1931 to  1933  was barely greaterthan the output  in the  single year 1929.   The  floor space  of new residentialbuilding begun annually  in the years 1932 to 1935 was approximately one-eighthand the value one-tenth of that begun in 1928.  The production of machine toolsin 1931 was only one-third  of the production in  1929.  In the first part  of thisreport we have analysed in  some detail the effect of this reduced output in thecase of a  single  product, namely, motor  cars,  for which  fairly comprehensivestatistics are available.  We find that the deficiency of production in the years of depression has been such that the  total number of cars on the road has beenreduced by 11 per cent,  and that of the cars  remaining on  the  road, at  least\ per  cent, are  over eight years  of  age and  may be regarded as  obsolete.Moreover, in spite of the improved  financial conditions prevailing in  1934 and1935,  the deterioration of the condition of the cars on the road continued to amarked extent in the first of these years and to  a very much smaller extent in thesecond.  If in the next few years all cars were scrapped at the completion of theireighth year  of service and  if the number of cars on the road were  graduallybrought up  to  the 1929  level, there  would be  room  for a  substantially  larger-annual  output  of cars over the  next three  years than actually  took  place  inthe boom year of  1929.  No doubt  the  case of motor cars is not quite typical.They  have a shorter period of useful life than other forms of machinery, andin consequence a  deficiency of  production results  more quickly  in  a serious-shortage of supplies than in the  case of longer-lived instruments of production.But there can be little doubt that over a large field, somewhat similar conditions&quot;prevail, that the total productive equipment available for use has  been reducedduring the depression, and  that  of  this equipment an important proportion is over age.    52.  The position, of course, is substantially different in the case of buildings.The length of life of a building is far too great for the wearing out of buildingsput up  in the boom period  to affect demand within any period with which we need concern ourselves.   House building in the United States,  as elsewhere, is-dependent on first, the growth of population in  the relevant age groups;  and,secondly, the standard of accommodation which is conventionally looked upon as adequate.   The  rate of  growth of  the American population is  slowing  down,partly from the same causes as are operative in  this country, partly because ofthe great curtailment in  immigration.  On this ground  alone, therefore, a some-what  lower level  of building activity might be expected in the current decade,than  in its  predecessor,  though the almost complete  cessation of residentialbuilding during the depression may have been of sufficient importance to balancethis factor.   On the other hand  there is every reason to suppose  that there is-great room  for  improvement in the general standards of American  housing..
Judged by English ideas this is defective both in respect of quality and amountof accommodation.  There is  obviously scope for important developments in thefield of house-building in the  event of even  a moderate change in the importance attached to this form of expenditure.   We can, therefore, feel confident that theremust soon be a revival of activity, and we  have no doubt that the improvementobservable in the value of building plans pa,ssed in the last half of 1935, whichwe have  noticed  in the first part of this report (paragraph 16  above),  willcontinue in  the current year.     53.  A discussion of the  outlook for the capital.producing industries would need to be supplemented, if we were to deal  fully with  the subject, by studies of anumber of important groups of capital using industries, such as the railways, the electrical supply industries in both of which serious  deficiencies of equipmentseem to exist,  and the services,  such as defence and  road-building, which are directly under  the control of  the central and local government authorities.  Butwe have said enough to indicate that the cessation of capital investment during theperiod of  depression has brought about a situation  in which even the greatcapacity of  the American constructional and engineering  industries might  be fairly fully  employed  for quite  a considerable period before  conditions of  an over supply  of capital equipment reasserted themselves.   It  is clear, however,that a recovery based on capital expenditure at the rate prevailing in the twentiescannot be looked upon as permanent.  It would involve a rate of expansion ofcapital  equipment which, even in the  twenties it proved impossible to maintain,and is.to-day likely to be maintained for a rather shorter  period.     54.  We turn next to the rehabilitation of the American financial structure.Among the most important group of measures adopted by the Administration to thisend  was that which sought to improve the position  of the agricultural areas,relatively to that of the industrial areas.   The  former areas were in  generalthe  debtors of the latter; and if their debts were to be  of any value, it  was essential  that  the products which they sold should  command  a price which enabled their debts to be  paid.   Agricultural populations normally suffer in times of depression through their  relatively small powers  of adapting  their output to the needs of a diminishing market; and this weakness brought about a  relativefall  in  the value of the production of the  American  agricultural states, which inevitably impaired their capacity to pay their debts.    The Agricultural Adjust-ment Act, which  has  recently been declared unconstitutional, together  with anumber of  other  acts which   now appear  likely  to  suffer the same  fate, didsomething to redress the balance which was previously weighted in favour of theindustrial areas, and this had the effect of maintaining the value of agriculturaldebts, and indirectly supported the banking  structure at one of its weakest points.Nevertheless, in spite of its undoubted usefulness during the period of crisis, we doubt whether the disappearance  of  this act will be followed immediately  byuntoward consequences.   The droughts of  the last two years  must effectivelyprevent any rapid expansion  of agricultural production, and  if  in the  future the purchasing power of the  industrial areas expands, the increased monetarydemand for agricultural produce from this  quarter should maintain  the solvencyof agricultural producers.     55.  The agricultural policy of the administration has been only one of theinfluences  tending to  restore  the  stability of  the American  financial  system.Between the end of 1929 and the middle of  1933 deposits, exclusive of inter-bankdeposits, in all the banks in the  United States fell from 55-3  thousand  million dollars  to 38-0 thousand million  dollars.  The latter figure excludes deposits  inbanks which at that time were closed as a result  of the banking crisis.  since june 1933 deposits have  been  rising, and now probably amount to approximately46-5 thousand million dollars. Thus, in the last 2-J  years bank  deposits have risen by 8^ thousand million  dollars.  Not  all of this  increase, however,  reflectsan expansion of the liquid resources of private individuals and business firms.There has been an increase in treasury deposits, in the deposits of other govern-ment agencies, and of  items in transit which should properly  be deducted fromthe  total.  But the  increase in private and business  deposits  has clearly been-substantial.     56.  Between the end of June 1932 and  the end of September 1935 the UnitedStates Government debt increased by  almost exactly 10 thousand million dollars.
 Within the same period the cash balances held by the Treasury increased by nearly If thousand million dollars; but this increase is almost exactly offset by the share- in the profit arising from the devaluation of gold which accrued to the Treasury. Moreover, within this period the normal receipts and expenditures of the Treasury approximately balanced, and the increase in the public  debt is thus equal to the recovery and relief expenditure that has been incurred.   Of this recovery and relief expenditure a considerable share, amounting to perhaps 4f thousand million dollars, has been advanced to various refinancing agencies,  and against this sum more or less valuable assets are held.   Thus the net expenditure of the United States Government which has accrued to the recipients as income over the last 3^ years  amounts to 5f thousand  million dollars.  Of  this total expenditure a very  large proportion  has  been incurred  since the middle of  1933.   During the  last  two  years,  consumption  expenditure  has  been  diminished  by  the efforts made by those whose ordinary reserves had been largely dissipated in the slump, to restore  these reserves to  normal proportions out of current saving. It has at the  same time been stimulated by the expenditure of those who have benefited by  loan financed expenditure of  the federal government.  Thus  the willingness  of the government to  incur  debts  to finance,  indirectly,  current expenditure has enabled a section of the public to increase its holding of quickly realisable claims to  money by an  abstention from expenditure, without any adverse repercussions on the total level of expenditure.  And had it been feasible in 1932 or 1933 to restore the confidence of the banking and financial community in the capital structure of American industry,  the liquid resources in the hands of the public might have been augmented by sales of securities by the public to the banks at prices which did not leave the sellers with a sense of impoverishment. In the circumstances of the time, however, this course may well have appeared impossible.  However they originated, the growing liquid resources of the public are now beginning to bear fruit, and there are  numerous signs of  improving consumption in those  fields which are particularly affected by the expenditure of the comparatively well-to-do.    57.  The  preceding analysis of the forces which have  been  at work in the United States during the last five  years  lead us to the view that the ground has now been  prepared  for a strong recovery in the general level of  productive activity.  As we have seen these preparatory stages have been divided into two. The first, which may roughly be held to have extended from the middle of 1930 to the end of 1933, was characterised by a great deficiency  in the output  of durable instruments of production and  of durable consumption goods below that which would  have been necessary to maintain intact the stock of such goods existing at the end of the  boom period.  During this phase of the depression the process of &quot; disinvestment &quot; led to terrible financial confusion.  In the second phase of the- depression, which extended over 1934 and  1935,  this financial confusion  was reduced to some kind of  order by the vigorous intervention of the government.  At. the same time  the output of durable goods  during this period,  though greater than iri the previous phase, was probably no more than sufficient to replace the normal wastage of  such goods.  A position  has now been reached, for the first time since the  beginning of the depression,  in which there is a large potential market for the output of capital goods, and underlying financial conditions have been established which make the exploitation of this market profitable.  During the period in which the  stock of capital goods is being brought up to a level more appropriate to present  circumstances,  industry should  experience conditions of renewed prosperity.    58.  The depression of 1929 was associated with an unprecedented  collapse in the level of prices, and it is natural to inquire whether a recovery in American economic activity is likely to be associated with a  sharp upward&quot; movement of prices.  But the  answer to this question will depend on the interaction of so many factors that it is  impossible to do more than indicate the most  important of these.  There is, first, the question of the increasing efficiency of  American industry.  In  the period 1924 to 1929, though the level of wages and of other-incomes showed a substantial rise, the prices of goods were on the whole falling.And it is possible that this combination may be repeated in the next few years. Secondly, we should have to consider  what  changes may occur  in the  level ofwages  in the next few  years.   Thirdly, there is the possibility that there may develop a great speculative movement.   If security prices rise rapidly, this will
be reflected in the prices of those commodities  which the owners  of securitiespurchase.   Whether  such  a  speculative  movement   develops  will  dependprincipally  on the action of the  United States authorities.   In so  far  as  therecent legislation relating  to  stock  exchange  transactions is not successfullychallenged as unconstitutional and proves  effective,  it may be possible  for  therise  in  security prices  to be more nearly confined to that which  the businesssituation justifies, even though the general monetary conditions  are  such as topromote speculation.  If this is not the case, we  have to consider  the probability of the United States pursuing a monetary policy unfavourable to  speculation.     59.   We  have explained that as financial  confidence improves  the main-tenance of  financial  equilibrium  is  likely  to require some  restriction on  theamount of money and its equivalents in the hands of the public. The willingness of the government to undertake  this restriction will  largely depend upon itsbudgetary circumstances.  If it is incurring a deficit it will be unwilling to add to the difficulties of financing of this  deficit by a restrictive financial policy.     60.   The United States is  not  yet equipped  with  adequate  permanent machinery  for the relief  of the destitution arising  from  unemployment.   Thesocial security legislation passed by the federal congress this year  requirescomplementary legislation by the  different states before  it can be effective.  Inthe meantime the existing stop gap machinery of relief works and public worksprovides an income for some at least of the great army of American unemployed.It is upon the financing of these  works that the greater part of the Americandeficit is incurred.   In  present circumstances  it  is clearly impossible for  theAmerican government to contemplate the sudden cessation of this  expenditure.Nor, in  view of the obstinate problem which the absorption of  the unemployed islikely to prove, is  it reasonable to hope that the  natural process of recovery will reduce the. numbers of the unemployed to an extent which will permit the federal government to retire gradually from its commitments  in this  field.   For  inAmerica, as in this country,  there is certainly a hard core of unemployment whichthe general  flow of increasing activity is  likely to pass by.     61.  To  have  undertaken  responsibility   for  a   large  number  of  theunemployed must  naturally place  a heavy burden on the  federal finances, but itis  important  not  to  exaggerate the  difficulties   of  this  task.   It  mustbe remembered that in the  period 1919 to  1930 the  American government waspaying  off  debt on a very large scale.   Since then  the  normal receipts of  theAmerican treasury have indeed been  diminished by the cessation  of war debtpayments.   On the other hand, there have been very  great  increases in the levelof taxation.   If the American national income  continues to  regain the gixnindlost  in  the  depression it  is reasonable to hope  that the yield of taxation will increase very substantially.  In 1934-35,  expenditure on relief and public works-amounted to $2,342 millions and $1,020 millions respectively.  In the current year it is estimated that these expenditures will be less, and in the year 1936-37they will no doubt be substantially less.  Moreover,  for  that year the ordinarybudget  contains appropriation for expenditure  under the  Social Security Act,and for expenditure on public works which should further  reduce the necessity for emergency expenditure on relief and public works.  Provided, therefore, that theSocial Security Act  and the taxation it imposes are not invalidated by  theSupreme  Court,   the  year  1936-37   should  see  a  considerable  induction  in emergency  expenditures.  Thus had the administration been able to count uponthe support of other branches of the federal government, we should have inclined to the view that difficulties experienced by the government in the raising of cashto meet current  obligations should  never become so serious as  to  exert  an appreciable influence on the course of monetary policy.   But the  fact that boththe Supreme Court and Congress  have recently taken decisions which must havegrave repercussions on  the budgetary position, the first  by invalidating  theprocessing taxes,  the second by passing  the Veterans&apos; Bonus Act, is not onlyimportant in itself, but also an indication of future dangers.  These dangers  areintensified  by the approach of  a  presidential  election.   In these circumstances.there is a real risk that the treasury&apos;s anxiety to maintain the market for govern-ment bonds, and the anxiety of those who must soon face an election  to take nostep which may bring unpopularity, may combine to prevent such financial action being taken as may be necessary  to avoid the growth of an unduly speculativesentiment.
    62.  We have not so far discussed, among the causes likely to lead to higher prices, that to which in current discussions in America, attention is most oftendirected.  This is the great excess of reserves held by the member banks of theFederal Reserve System with the Federal Reserve Banks over the reserves whichthey are obliged by law to maintain.  The legal minimum reserves of the memberbanks  vary with the  deposits which they themselves have accepted,  and at themoment,, under  the regulations at present  in  force, they are required to holdapproximately 2,700 million  dollars on deposit with the Federal Reserve Banks.In  fact, however, they  now hold approximately 5,750 million  dollars  of suchdeposits, or 3,050 million  dollars in excess of this minimum.  The control whichthe Federal Reserve Banks exercise over the rate of interest prevailing in themoney market depends, in the last resort, on their power  to force the memberbanks  to borrow from them by  selling  securities to the market.  At  present,however, the Federal Reserve Banks hold only something  over  2,400  million dollars of  saleable securities.  Even if  all of  these were  sold, excess  reserves would  still amount to 600 million dollars, which would permit of an expansionof member bank deposits by some twenty per cent, before recourse to the centralbanking system was necessary.  It is argued that without the  corrective influence of higher interest rates the  tendency for bank deposits to expand is likely to beirresistible, and that an expansion at least of this  magnitude  cannot thereforebe avoided.  Seeing that if  such an increase were to occur,  bank deposits would reach at least the level of the year 1929, during which speculative mania ran wild,it might  appear that  nothing  could  now&apos; prevent  the reappearance of  an undesirable boom psychology.    63.  This argument,  however, neglects  the  power which  now resides in theBoard of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System to increase  the proportionwhich  member bank desposits with the reserve banks must bear to deposits withthe member banks themselves.  It is within the competence of the board to double the present proportion.  If  this were done,  the  present excess reserves would bereduced to 350 million dollars, and it would be  possible for the Federal ReserveBanks to force the member banks to borrow from them  on a substantial  scale bythe sale of securities. This is, however, a device which can only be brought into play gradually, for the present excess reserves are by no means evenly distributed among the various member banks. Even to-day some banks only maintain theirlegal reserve by borrowing from the  reserve banks.  If  the legal reserve  require-ments  of member banks were substantially increased by order of the board, a highly critical situation might develop in some  States of the  Union.    64.  There  is, however,  one  source from which the reserve holdings of the member banks might be increased in such  a way that the  Reserve  Banks  lostcontrol of  the market, namely, by the continued importation  of  gold and silver.Imports of gold or silver by a member  bank are sold  to the treasury for gold or silver certificates, which in turn are deposited with the Federal Reserve Banks,and thus swell the reserve deposits of the importing member bank.  It is through such imports that member  bank deposits have been principally increased  thisyear, for the Reserve Banks have not been  buying securities.  During 1935 theUnited States imported on balance gold to the value of  1,739  million  dollars  and silver  to the value of 336 million dollars.  Should imports continue at this rate, itwould not be very long before the Federal Reserve system completely lost its powerto control the market.     65.   The continuance of the flow  of gold across  the  Atlantic  is likely  to prove  a source of embarrassment as much to the Americans who receive it, as tothose  European countries which are now  so very  unwillingly  losing it.   Thecircumstances in which this movement is taking place are interesting.  Since the-closing months of 1934, the favourable balance of trade which the United states had previously enjoyed has been very greatly diminished.  The drought of 1934was partly responsible  for this change, both by reducing the available  suppliesof  a number of agricultural commodities, for example, lard, which  the UnitedStates had previously exported, and by bringing her into the market for a numberof  commodities  in respect of which she had previously been self-sufficient.   Inpart,  also, more permanent causes were at work, such  as the restrictions placedon the production of a  great many  agricultural commodities,  the  growth  of
demand for imported raw materials as internal consumption revived, the policyof balancing imports against exports  from each individual country adopted ina number of important European markets.  At the same time the invisible items in the  balance  of payments  have been  moving against  the  United  States.American tourist  expenditure  is increasing.  American  receipts from overseasinvestments are smaller, both because of the repatriation of American capital andof the  spread of default.  Thus it has come about that the official estimates ofthe size of  all transactions on  income  account between America  and the  rest ofthe world show  that  in. the first  six months of 1935, American receipts fromabroad were approximately  equal to payments due abroad.  The  extensive move-ments of gold and  silver into the United States in the  same period were financedentirely by transactions on capital account.    66.  The flow of capital  into  the United  States in  the  last  six  monthsrepresented in part the  return of American money, either  that  which was  sent abroad  for refuge in  1932 and 1933, when  the  prospects at  home  seemedparticularly  black, or money lent to  central European  countries before 1929,which is now being repatriated at a heavy loss.  But to a substantial extent this-capital  is of European  ownership.  Moreover, it appears to be drawn less fromthe volatile fund of liquid international capital, the movements of which causedso much disturbance in the early stages of the exchange crisis, than from resourcesof private and corporate investors, who take a favourable view of the prospects of American common stocks.  It is probable that the considerable rise which hastaken place this year in the prices of American industrial securities is attributable to a substantial extent to buying  from English, French, and Dutch sources.    67.  The fact that  for  the time being  the United States has no longer afavourable  balance of payment of current account, is very  encouraging, and if weonly had to contemplate movements of  short term money, we should be inclined to take the view that the present movement of  capital to America was alreadyreaching its limit.  But now  that  European capital is being  attracted on asubstantial scale into the purchase of American equities, it is much more difficultto foresee  the probable limits to the present movement of  gold.   It must beremembered that one of the consequences of recent American legislation relatingto the  taxation  of profits  derived from stock  market operations has  been to stimulate greatly the European market in American securities.  As  things  nowstand, realised profits on security transactions are much more heavily taxed thanheretofore.  Moreover,  the extent to which losses on  security transactions  maybe set off against profits derived from  other sources has been severely restricted.The effect of these changes is to put a great premium on dealings undertaken onforeign stock exchanges, the profits from which may be  fairly easily concealedfrom the American authorities.   Moreover,  when Americans are  dealing on aconsiderable  scale  in  American securities on English, French, Dutch and otherstock exchanges, it is easier for  the nationals of these countries  themselves to invest in American securities.  A movement of capital, originating from changesin the views held by private investors as to the comparative advantages of holdingBritish, French,  Dutch,  and American securities may reach  much greater  dimen-sions than  any due to the operations of professional financial firms.   Moreover,the knowledge which will be available to the authorities as  to the extent of suchmovements will be much less exact than the knowledge they have been  able to gain of the movements of short term capital.  The task of  our own exchange equalisation  account, for example, is likely to be much more difficult now that important capital  movements of this kind are beginning to  take  place.    68.  In these  circumstances we cannot feel confident  that the present move-ment of gold to America will come to an early close.  In  terms of gold it is not unlikely that  American  securities are  still undervalued, in  spite of their recentrise, and that French and Dutch securities are still overvalued, in spite of theirpresent low prices.  Devaluation by the gold bloc countries would no doubt  correctthis  position; but until that event occurs, the flow of gold to America is likelyto continue.  Nevertheless, we doubt whether it will ever achieve such dimensionsas to put the American money market beyond the  control  of the Federal ReserveBanks.  For it is unlikely that enough gold could be  drawn from Europe for  this to occur without causing the devaluation of the franc.       [12653]                                                     F 2
                                (c) Germany.     69.  If account is taken only of the increase in the volume of employment, the recovery which has taken place in Germany is perhaps the most impressive of anyin the world.  But this recovery is of so unbalanced a nature, has brought so littlebenefit to the working population and gives so much ground for anxiety as to thefuture, that it is obvious that, on economic grounds alone, a more normal improve-ment would have been greatly to be preferred. But it is by  now fully apparent that  in Germany  &quot; considerations   of  plenty  &quot;  have  been subordinate  to&quot; considerations of power.&quot;     70.  In an earlier report we have already drawn attention to  the fact thatrecovery in Germany has been almost confined to the industries which producecapital goods  and therefore benefit from expenditure  on armaments and on suchrelated objects as the strategical development of road and rail services.   these industries  appear to be now as fully employed as in the peak years of the boomof 1928  and 1929.  In  the case of  industries producing goods of  a consumablenature the evidence of improvement is much smaller.  Their  production appearsto have  increased by no more than ten per cent,  since  the worst year of thedepression, is  substantially lower than a year ago, and is almost twrenty per cent.lower than in  1928.  When it is remembered that  in the  same period employment has apparently increased by a third, and is now only six  per cent, less than in the peak year  of 1929,  it can be realised what an important change has taken placein the distribution of German productive effort.     71.  Such a  substantial decline in the proportion of production devoted to immediate  consumption would normally be associated with a corresponding fallin the level of wages or a corresponding rise  in  the level of the prices of thosecommodities on which wages are spent.  But, if German official figures are to bebelieved, the changes  which have taken place in wages and the  cost of  living arenot nearly  great  enough to account for this phenomenon.  The answer appearsto be that in this respect official figures are unreliable.  There has been since thebeginning  of  1933 a much greater increase  in  retail  prices  than is officiallyadmitted.   According  to  the published cost of living  index  the  rise since march 1933 amounts  to between 5 and    per cent.  An estimate recently madeby the commercial secretary to the embassy in Berlin, on the other hand, is to theeffect that  in the same period  the true rise has been approximately 15 per cent.The discrepancy is explained by the fact that  the controlled prices  on  which theindex is based are  in practice generally exceeded, and that uncontrolled prices,Avhich are  not represented to an adequate extent in the index, have risen muchmore than controlled prices.  Moreover, though the level of hourly wages has been maintained as far  as possible, numerous deductions from wages are now made which effectually reduce the actual  receipts of the ordinary wage earner.  It isprobably somewhere  near  the mark to say  that  compared  Avith  1932,  wdienunemployment was heavy but  real wages high, the  working classes of germany are doing thirty per cent, more work for ten per cent, greater return.     72.  Furthermore, the effect of the measure  of control introduced into thedistribution of food-stuffs has been to reduce  still more the advantage  which theGerman working class has derived from the increase in income.  There  have beennotable instances of commodities being in short supply.  Temporary shortages  ofeggs, vegetables and  beef appeared in the spring and  summer.  More recentlythere has been a serious shortage of pork and butter.  These shortages  have been met, not by a rise in the prices of the commodities concerned, but by a  system  of unofficial rationing.   Taking  all these  circumstances  into  account it  may  be doubted whether  the material  prosperity of the German working classes is now-much higher than  in 1932.   On the other hand  the  great improvement  in theemployment situation has in a large measure dissipated  the sense of uncertaintywhich then affected them.     73.  Generally speaking  an improvement in  general productive activitywhich is not supported by a substantial improvement in  the level of consumptionmust be  regarded as  being most precariously  based.  In the last resort capital goods are required  only to facilitate the production of consumable goods,  and  if their production  for  a time outruns the growth  in consumption,  a point must
                                     3:7eventually be reached at which, they become unsaleable.  At that point a recoverybased on a revival of demand in the capital producing industries must give wayto depression.  We have seen that in Germany there is a great disproportion inthe growth of production in the capital producing industries, and If  we weredealing with an ordinary revival of commercial activity we should take  the viewthat before long a reaction would be  bound to set in as the market for capital goods would soon become saturated. In fact, however, a great part of the outputof the capital producing industries consists of armaments, and is  being sold in afield where it will never come into competition with existing commercial capital.This particular  difficulty will not arise  so long as  the  German Governmentcontinues to invest the capital of  the nation in armaments, and the improvementin employment in the present recovery is likely to be maintained,  though, ofcourse, such expenditure involves the  adverse  reactions to which  we allude  else-where.  The difficulties which face the government in this policy relate principallyto the technical  measures  which  have been used to provide finance for their programme of rearmament.    74.  Before discussing the financial problems of Germany, we must considerthe obstacles which have prevented an expansion of  German consumption  in a proportion which would bear a more equal relation to the  expansion  in Germaninvestment activity.   If the  German  people were fully employed,  this  question would call for no special comment. It would be merged in the general questionof the financial measures which have brought about a redistribution of purchasingpower favourable to  the observed reorganisation of productive resources.  Infact, however, the German capacity to produce goods for current consumptionhas not yet been reached.   In the textile industries, for example, on the averageonly seven hours a day are  being worked, compared  with nearly eight  in the metal  producing industries.   Moreover,  apart  from  short-time   working,unemployment still remains substantial.   As we have seen, total employment isstill 6 per cent, below the level of 1929, and since that time there  must have  been considerable additions to the  potential  labour force, even after allowance is madefor the greater numbers now serving in the army.    75.  As is well known, the principal obstacle in. the way of an expansion ofGerman consumption is the  grave difficulty which is being experienced  in thepurchase of raw  materials from  abroad.&apos;  In  all  the industrialised countries of western Europe,  consumable goods require for their production not only a certainquantity of  domestic labour, but also  a certain quantity of raw materials, thehome supply of  which is subject to physical  limits.   Moreover,  in view  of the comparative rigidity in consumers&apos; tastes, it is extremely difficult to divert their demand from commodities which contain  a large proportion of imported  rawmaterials  to commodities or services which make small demands upon the supplyof  these materials, by any  feasible  alterations  in  the  comparative prices ofdifferent commodities.   Thus it comes about that an expansion of  home consump-tion carries  with  it the need for greater imports of foodstuffs and raw materials.If we  assume for the  moment that the supply of  foreign  exchange with whichthese raw materials may be bought is unalterable, the level of German productionof consumable goods is seen to be dependent on the residue of foreign exchangeavailable  for  the imports  of raw materials after the  requirements of the armament producing industries, which are normally given  preference, have  been met.     76.  The assumption that the supply of foreign exchange is limited, whichwe have made in the preceding paragraph, cannot, of course, have any validityif we take into account a period  of time in the course of which  Germany mightundertake a fundamental readaptation of her economic structure.   In favourable circumstances a great number of industries might develop in Germany for the products of  which there would be a readily expansible market abroad.  But  suchdevelopments can hardly be&apos;expected,  so long as German  currency is over-valuedin the world market.   For  the natural effect of such over-valuation is to depressthe exporting industries and to favour  industries producing for the home market.If  the difficulty which Germany is now experiencing Avere expected to persist,the appropriate remedy would be a devaluation of the currency, even though this might entail some immediate loss of exchange through the sale of existing exportsat a rather lower price (in foreign currency) than they now fetch.
      77.   In fact, however, the policy being pursued in Germany, suggests that  the  dominant consideration has been, not the future equilibrium  of her foreign  trade, but the possibility of securing large supplies of exchange in the immediate  present.  The rearmament programme being undertaken by the Government puts  a double strain upon these supplies.   It creates a demand for additional imports,  and it claims for its own purposes a large part of the capacity of those industries  on which Germany has in the past  depended  for its exports.  So long as this  exceptional  strain is  continued, the  German  authorities will  be unwilling to  forego any part of their present sources of foreign exchange in the interest of a  more stable equilibrium in the future.      78.   The position of the German export industries is by no means similar to  that which  faced our own export  industries from 1925 to 1931.   In those years  our  industries had great  potential capacity to produce; they were within reach  of markets  which could  absorb  considerably  greater  quantities   of  their  production;  but they were jDrevented  from exploiting these markets because their  costs of production were  too high for them to be  able to export at a profit.  In  the  case  of Germany this latter  consideration is  of  comparatively  minor  importance.  The system  of levies on home industries to form a fund to finance  otherwise unprofitable exports, insures that no exports will be lost, merely because  Germany  is unable to compete at world prices.  Moreover, the various  forms of  barter trade can also  be  used  to  avoid  any of the normal consequences of an  unduly high internal price level.   In fact, -however, both these devices  are used  with great circumspection, and only when the increase in exports so  brought about  cannot have the effect of depressing the price at which other German exports are  sold.  As  far as her present range of exports is concerned,  Germany is perhaps  in the position of a monopolist who  is already selling his products at the  price  at which they yield the maximum revenue.   She cannot materially increase the  value of these exports  by a reduction or by an increase in price.  She  can only  increase her  receipts from abroad by extending the range of  her  exports.   She  can only do  this by reducing her internal prices and thereby sacrificing some of  the monopoly revenue on which she at present subsists.  And this she is unwilling  to do so long as the rearmament programme continues to place a strain upon her  resources of foreign exchange.     79.   Though the  rearmament programme  is  responsible  for  the obstinate nature of the German problem of foreign exchange, this problem would not have arisen in its  present form had not the outlets for  German exports been already seriously curtailed by a number of events, outside her control, which have occurred since 1929, when she was able to support her population at a far higher standard of living  than to-day.   First,  at  that time Germany,  in  spite  of the heavy reparation payments she was making, was borrowing from abroad on a very large scale, which  even after  the reparation payments, which have now been abolished. and her interest payments, which she has now largely repudiated, had been met, allowed her some surplus with which to pay for current imports.  Moreover, the same was  then true of  a  number of  countries  in  South-Eastern Europe, upon whose prosperity the important German export  trade to these quarters depends. Secondly, Germany more than any other country benefited from the over-valuation of the pound  in the twenties, and has suffered more than any other  country from the subsequent depreciation of the pound and the  changes in British fiscal and trade policy  which accompanied it.  Germany used to have a  very considerable favourable balance  of  trade  with Great Britain  and  with the  Scandinavian countries.  The latter in turn again  had a considerable favourable balance of trade with Great Britain.  Through these channels Germany was able to secure sterling for imports from the raw material producing countries of the  British Empire and South America, with which she had a considerable  unfavourable balance of trade.   This means of securing raw materials is now largely closed to her.  Finally,  Germany always carried on a  very  considerable trade with. Russia, exchanging industrial products for raw materials.  With  the growing industrialisation of Russia  under the Five  Years Plans, this &quot;source  of  rawr material imports is becoming progressively less  accessible to her.   For all these reasons, the exchange difficulties of Germany have become much  more pressing.     80.  After the question of foreign exchange, the most serious problem facing the German  Government is that of finance.  This problem resembles in manv
respects that facing the Government of the United States;  but the essentials ofthe situation are obscured by the many divergences between  English and Germanbanking  habits, and by  the secrecy surrounding  the German  Governmentsfinancial transactions.    81.  The feature of the German banking system, which is of special interest for our present purpose, is the great importance which attaches to the inland bill.German  banks keep comparatively small reserves  of cash (including thereindeposits with the central  bank), and, as  yet, there is no rigid relationship, suchas exists by  custom in this country and by law in the United  States, between their  cash holding and their deposits.   They rather regard  their holding ofdiscountable bills as the measure of their liquid resources.  Moreover, as bills arereadily discountable with  the banks, an ordinary business firm may look upon itsown holding of bills as almost equivalent to bank deposits.  Thus it comes about that the liquidity  of the German  banking system,  and  indeed  of  the  wholeindustrial community, is  extremely  sensitive to changes in the  volume of billsaccepted  by borrowers whose solvency is  be)rond reproach.   At the height of thedepression the liquid position of  the  German  banking  system  was greatlyimpaired by the shortage of bills of first class quality.  It was, therefore, feasiblefor the Government from 1932 onwards to secure funds for expenditure on objectswhich might  promote recovery, and at the same time to reduce the tension in thefinancial  system by  issuing bills  of a kind acceptable to bankers.    82.  The first  big issues of bills of  this  kind, tax certificates  and workcreation bills, were  made in 1932.  These issues were publicly announced.  Sincethe advent  of  the  present  regime  to  power this  process has  been greatlyaccelerated, but has taken place under a cloak  of  secrecy, largely no doubt withthe object of concealing from the outside  world  the scale upon which rearmamentis  taking  place, but also  to  avoid nervousness on the part of the public overthe possible inflationary consequence of  this expenditure.   In  August of  thisyear when private  estimates  of the size of this  debt were being increasinglybandied about, the German government, with a great show of candour, admittedthe existence of a  substantial debt incurred through  expenditure on a numberof respectable objects, such  as  the public works programmes which are nowHearing completion.  It did not, however,  admit the existence  of,the armamentbills, the direct advances by banks to government departments and the advancesby banks to firms for the production of armaments which have been guaranteed by the government,  all of which are known to exist.  The present German public debt thus consists of three parts, the ordinary  public  debt,  figures of which areregularly published, which amounts to 14-J thousand million marks (though thetotal is sometimes given rather differently), the debt admitted  in August which amounted to about 6 thousand million marks, but which overlaps to the extent of1\ thousand  million  marks  with  the ordinary public debt, and which  adds,therefore, 4^ thousand million marks to the total, and lastly the unpublished debt,largely incurred on armaments expenditure, which may, according to one guess,amount to between  11^ and 12-J thousand million  marks.   This gives a total ofapproximately  31  thousand  million marks.   The figures  given relate to  the30th June, 1935, and it is believed that the public debt is now  increasing at therate of nearly  500 million marks  a  month.   The increase in  the public  debtbetween the end of 1932  and the  middle of 1935 is,  on this estimate, between18 and 19 thousand million marks or at the rate  of say 600 million marks a month.A  very large part of this increase has taken  the form of  comparatively  short period obligations  and bills, the existence of  which has added greatly to  theliquidity of the money market.    83.  As in America, the issue of these loans has been possible with compara-tively small inflationary results, just because at the  time of their issue there was adearth of short-term obligations in which the banks  could invest funds placed withthem by depositors.   In Germany, however, the  effect of their issue has been seenless in a rise in bank deposits than in a reduction in the advances made by banksto  industry and by a reduction in the volume of perhaps rather insecure commer-cial bills outstanding.  So long  as firms and individuals are anxious either toincrease their deposits or to pay  off advances  made to them,  financing by  thegovernment in this  form can  take place without inflationary effect.  The public,however, is not willing to increase its holding of short-term, securities indefinitely ^
and a time  must come  when  the further creation  of  short-term  debt  by thegovernment leads to increased spending on the part of the public, or to increasedinvestment in more speculative directions.  The normal inflationary symptomsof rising prices of goods  and stock exchange securities then begin to appear.     84.  These symptoms are indeed already noticeable  in Germany, though thecontrol exercised  by the government in a number of markets has prevented their full development,  in these circumstances it is clear that if a very serious financial situation is to be avoided, the German government will have to change its methodof  finance.   Already  steps have been  taken to consolidate some  of the shortterm debt by the  issue of longer dated securities.  But at  present it is doubtfulwhether they are being issued as fast as the  government debt is being increased.In  view, however, of the greatly reduced indebtedness of business firms,  and ofthe limitation of dividend payments which must act not only  as a  deterrent toinvestment in ordinary stock exchange securities, but must  also have the effectof deflecting the  profits  of business enterprises  into the investment market, theconditions seem favourable for a further extension of the programme of consolida-tion.  Even at its present level the German public debt is not unreasonably high,judged by  British  standards.  If,  therefore, the German government relies infuture on long term financing it should be able to continue  to raise money for its programme of expenditure for some considerable while,  and as funds raised inthis way will be withdrawn from the money market, it should be able to preventthe over supply of short term assets available to the latter leading  to a seriousrise in prices.    85.  Sooner or later we must assume that  the present rate of  expenditureon armaments will be abated, and  the German government will have to face thedifficulties of a transition from the present highly artificial state of demand.  Insome respects the mere cessation  of  government expenditure on  armaments is bound  to  afford  immediate  relief.   More foreign exchange  will  at once beavailable for ordinary industry, and it will be possible to  allow a  substantial improvement in the standard of living. Moreover, a serious threat to  the stability of the  monetary system will be removed,  and public  confidence  should  improve.On the other hand, the distribution of  productive resources  will have  been seriously thrown out of balance by the necessities of rearmament, and it will notbe possible  to find full employment for the whole population in the  occupationsto which they will at the  time be attached.  The armaments programme will havehad the effect of  extending the  industries which in normal  conditions producecapital equipment.  No  doubt the  cessation  of  armaments expenditure will befollowed  by a revival of consumption, both because there  will be more foreign exchange available for this purpose, and because the  monetary savings made bythe public in the period of rearmament and low consumption will then be availablefor such expenditure.  This revival in demand  should for a time be associatedwith a demand  for capital  goods,  which may maintain  the  firms previouslyemployed on armament manufacture fairly fully occupied for a while.  The endof the  armaments programme may  therefore be  followed by  a short-lived boom.When, however, the deferred expansion of private  industry  has been completed the over-extension  of  the  capital  producing industries will  lead  directly to unemployment there, followed, as demand from this quarter falls off, by unemploy-ment among other sections of the population.                                (d) France.    86.  We have dealt  at considerable length with the  situation in the UnitedStates  and  in Germany.  We do not propose to discuss  the French  situation inthe same detail.   The course of  events  in  France provides,  however, a  very interesting  contrast with that in the two former countries.  The French govern-ment, like the American and the German, has in the past few years been incurringvery substantial deficits, and has  also undertaken substantial  programmes ofexpenditure out of  money raised by loan.  But it has not been able  to establisheasy conditions in the money market.  Rigid limitations are  imposed by legisla-tion on the extent of  the short-term debt,  and the government  has been forced.nominally at least, to rely on the issue of long-term securities to finance the deficit in  practice these loans have been taken up only to a .small extent by the public.The latter  has preferred to buy the short-term securities previously  held by the
100Wwwoffice of the sinking fund and that of the savings banks, who in turn have been obliged  to take up  the bulk of the new government  issues.   But the short-termsecurities sold by these two offices have not sufficed to offset the  loss of liquidassets entailed by the drain of gold abroad.  The combination of a steady reduc-tion of  investment outlets  for  money  requiring  protection  against capitaldepreciation, and a  steady increase in the size of the public debt has brought abouta great  increase in  the rates obtained on long-term government securities.*  Inthese circumstances the rate  at  which capital  has  been available to  private andindustrial borrowers  has  shown  a consistent tendency  to increase,  and private capital expenditure has fallen off to a disastrous extent.    87.   We cannot judge what benefits the French  exporting industries wouldderive from a devaluation of the franc.  It is  quite possible that, in the presentdisorganised state of world trade, it would be comparatively small.  But the realneed for devaluation in France does not arise from the position of the exportingindustries, serious though that  is.   Nor does  it arise from the existence  of  an adverse  balance of payments.  Indeed, w-e  do not think that there is any reasonto suppose that this is at all serious; the movements of gold wdiich are takingplace to-day, as we  have  seen in our discussion of the United States, arise  fromtransactions on capital account.  But we are convinced that  so  long as the fearof devaluation still  overhangs the French security markets, it would be vain forthe Bank of France to undertake the measures necessary to re-establish liquidity.For this reason the restoration of financial confidence in France will have to follow,not precede, the re-establishment of confidence in the franc.  And in this situation the fears  of  devaluation will only be set at rest when devaluation  has already taken place.    88.   The condition of the other  members of the gold bloc is essentially thesame as in France.   In the  early stages of the depression large quantities  offugitive money found its way to Holland and Switzerland.   Under the influence of this  inflow of  capital interest rates  declined, and  in  these  circumstancessomething of a building boom developed, especially in  Holland. Now that thecurrencies of these two  countries are suspect,  the fugitive capital has  been withdrawn,  and  the local  money  markets have  lost their liquid character.Interest rates are rising, and the development of building activity is being dampeddown.  In the case of Holland, the paiticularly severe contraction of  world tradeduring the depression has added greatly to troubles which would in any event havebeen severe.  Holland, before the slump, played two parts in European trade.She was, on the one  hand,  an important centre of entrepot trade, and on the otherhand she was an exporter of agricultural produce.  In  both these parts she has suffered severely.   The reduction in the  import and export trade of Germanymaterially  affected  the  prosperity  of the  Dutch  ports.   More  recently,  the devaluation of the belga has improved the competitive power of Antwerp, whichaffords an alternative outlet for the exported production of the steel works on the rhine, at the expense of Rotterdam.  Finally,  the  great growth of agrarianprotectionism in Europe  has  greatly reduced the market for  Dutch agricultural products.  The Dutch government has for  some time supported  the agriculturalcommunity by an elaborate system  of subsidies, which  have had the  effect  ofmaintaining  the prices of food-stuffs paid by the  domestic consumer.   more recently, the government has  attempted to  reduce  the dependence of  Dutcheconomic life on commerce and agriculture by a policy  of industrialisation.  Itmay, however, be doubted whether, in the difficult circumstances in which Hollandis now placed, this policy will meet with very great success....  The Dutch positionwould have been by now considerably more serious if it had not been  for the risewhich has recently taken place in the value of a number of her colonial products.This has entailed an increase in her receipts from her overseas investments, andan alleviation of her exchange difficulties.                    (e)  Liquidity and international  trade.    89.   In the  preceding sections we have seen what an important part therestoration or the failure to restore a condition of liquidity to the financial system has played in the recovery or lack of recovery experienced in the countries we have    * The interest rates obtainable on government securities  in France are not adequatelyrepresented by that obtainable on 3 per cent. Rentes.      [12653]                                                        G
discussed.  Moreover, if we consider liquidity in its widest sense, the experienceof this country reinforces that of others.  Liquidity in this sense may be defined as the ease with which solvent borrowers are able to meet their obligations as theymature.  It may be achieved  either by borrowers maintaining a reserve of cashor claims to cash from institutions like the banks or from the state, or by a  readymarket being provided for the other assets upon which borrowers may have reliedwhen entering into their commitments. It was in the second of these ways that conditions improved most markedly in  Great  Britain after the  conversionoperation of 1932, though a very substantial increase in bank deposits was broughtabout at the same time  by open market operations on the part of the  Bank ofEngland.     90.  At the same  time  the measures introduced  to improve the  financialposition  upon  a national  scale have generally been associated with measureswhich impaired the efficiency of the  pre-existing international financial system.In  some measure this  was inevitable.   The mechanism of  the  pre-war goldstandard involved the use of  just those devices which  have recently been foundeffective  regulators  of conditions of  internal  activity.   The accepted  remediesfor weak exchanges were the creation of stringent conditions in the money market,and a severely orthodox balancing of the national budget.  The remedy for undulystrong exchanges was, similarly, the creation of conditions of abundant credit inthe money market.   If it could be secured that weak exchanges always co-existedwith  conditions  of over-speculation  at home,  and  that  strong  exchan Resalways   accompanied   periods  of   depression,  this   would  have  been  nodisadvantage  in  the  pre-war  gold  standard.   But  at  any  rate  duringthe  post-war  period  the  exact  reverse  has  been  the  case,  and   govern-ments  have  been  forced to choose  whether  they  would  use  these  regu-lative mechanisms to secure internal  equilibrium or  to preserve stability of theexchanges.  One by one they have been  forced to prefer the former  of  the objectives.   But when they have made this choice they have been forced  to adoptconcurrently some stop-gap method  for  the  control of  the  exchanges.  GreatBritain abandoned the gold standard.  The United  States abandoned  the goldstandard for a time, and then revived it, but at the same&apos; time so under-valuedher currency that she had no need to fear the external weakness of her exchangesat any rate for a time.   A number of countries, headed by Germany, introducedan all-embracing system of exchange control.   Holland and Trance,  which have maintained the  gold standard unimpaired, have not been able to  overcome theinternal  forces of deflation.   The result of these different measures has been tocreate very great difficulties in the carrying through of international transactions.It is these difficulties,  as much as the growth of tariffs, which have prevented a growth of  international trade concurrently with the improvement in domestictrade throughout the world.    91.  It is very probable that some sacrifice in the ease of international inter-course is necessary if governments are to secure sufficient control over the economic life of their countries to prevent repetitions of the  disastrous collapses whichmarked the last depression.  In the long run a world in which international tradewas reduced to its present scale of importance, but in which individual countries were free to adapt their monetary policies to the needs of the moment, might prove a more stable and even a  more prosperous place than would a world in whichthe pre-war international gold standard had  been revived.  But the productiveforces  of the  world are organised to-day in a manner  which assumes  for itsjustification a far higher degree of international  specialisation than is possibleso long as world trade is  confined within its present limits.  Recovery throughoutthe world will progress much more rapidly if it is possible for  the complementary&quot;depressed areas&quot;  in different countries to  exchange  their products  throughinternational trade, than if their surplus working populations and productive resources must gradually be  absorbed into their respective national economies.The present obstructions to world trade have been carried much further than iswarranted  by the necessities of individual recovery  policies,  and they must  be diminished if world trade is to revive.             &apos;    92.  Within the sterling  area international trade appears to be carried on with comparatively little friction.   Outside it the most  serious obstacles to tradearise  from the actions of  those countries  who, often with considerable benefit
to themselves, have adopted the principle of clearing agreements.  The effect ofthis widespread practice is to divide the currencies of the world into two groups,those which are free, and those the use of which is restricted.  It is obviously very greatly to the advantage of an exporting country to  sell its goods for a currencywhich is free.  It may then be used for purchases of any commodity in any market.At the same time  there are equally  obvious advantages in purchasing from a country with which a clearing agreement is in  existence.  For by so doing theleast possible drain is made on the supplies of free currencies.  These naturalpreferences work out  to the disadvantage of the countries with free currencies.They   are   good  countries  to  export  to, but  bad  countries  to  importfrom.   Moreover, it is often very difficult for a free currency country to securepayments  from a country with a  restricted currency,  even though  it has an unfavourable balance  of trade with it.   For the free currency can often be put to better use than the paying off of old debts.  There thus arises a tendency forclearing agreements to spring up in places where they serve no essential purpose.    93.  This  spreading of clearing agreements is a tendency  which is likely tohave very unfavourable repercussions upon  the fluidity  of world trade.   To avery large extent world trade must .always remain  &quot;triangular&quot; in  character.Yet triangular trade suffers very severely in  a world  of clearing agreements.  Atthe same time  it is very difficult to see what effective steps the countries whichwish to maintain free currencies  can take  to prevent  the  growth of  clearing-agreements.  Perhaps the only response on the part of these countries would beto institute a common clearing account with every country which decided to join the restricted  group.   In this way  at  any rate it would be secured that thecountries which  did  not  maintain  free currencies gained no  advantage at theexpense of those who did.  It is,  however, extremely difficult  to visualise  an effective solution along these lines.    2 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W. 1,          February 10, 1936.o
