au-3TYiOUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY 3 GOVERNMENT.ST.COPY NO .CABINET.LOSSES DUE TO SANCTIONS,Memorandum by,the President of the Board of Trade.      The Board of Trade have been receiving an increasing                                                 &quot; &apos;            illnumber of letters enquiring whether some form of financialcompensation can be given for losses due to the applicationof  sanctions to Italy, and I think that my colleagues will wishto be aware, so far as the information is available, of thenature and extent of the losses which are being suffered inthis way.     The requests for compensation fall into three main categories -   1.  Requests from firms whose outstanding trade debts         due from Italy cannot at present be liquidated,         for advances or guarantees from His Majesty&apos;s         Government.   2.  Requests from British firms both in the United Kingdom         and in Italy alleging that their trade has been         entirely or partially destroyed as a result of the         application of sanctions.   3.  Requests from individuals for compensation for loss         of employment and earning power, alleged to be due         to the application of sanctions.     As regards 1 (outstanding trade debts),  my colleagues are, no doubt,  aware that arrangements have been made withthe Italian authorities for the machinery of the Anglo-Italian Payments Agreement of the 27th April,  1935,  to bemaintained,  and for the sums collected by the Controller of anglo-Italian debts under the Treaty of Feace (Covenant ofthe League of Nations) No.2 Order to be paid into the sterling account at the Bank of England under that agreement.   The amounts in the sterling account are availablefor the liquidation of debts due to  United  Kingdom firmsfor goods imported  into  Italy from  the United  Kingdom after                        -1-
 the  18th March,  1935, and  imported or in  transit before the 18th November.    It  is not yet possible to give a definite estimate of the  total of  such debts due to firms in the United  Kingdom which will  still  await transfer when the amounts in the sterling account have been exhausted but from the  information  at present available it is possible that it will be of the order of  2,000,000.      In addition there are outstanding debts due from Italy to firms in the  United Kingdom for -      (a) Goods imported into Italy before the 18th March, 1935.      (b) Goods imported into Italy from countries other than             the  United Kingdom. Transfers of such debts from Italy have been virtually suspended since  the  18th November, and it is estimated that the  amount still  outstanding is of the order of  1,000,000.      Thus the amount of outstanding debts for goods supplied to Italy is  likely to amount to about  3,000,000.   I have no information  as to the amount of other commercial debts awaiting transfer from Italy.      As regards  2 (requests for compensation from British firms whose  trade has suffered as a result of the  application of sanctions) enquiries have been received from about a dozen  j firms in the United Kingdom whose business was wholly or       I mainly  with  Italy.   In addition,  requests have been received on behalf  of a number of British firms in Italy whose business  as  shipping agents has almost entirely ceased.  Two such firms  (Messrs.  Di Luggo Wood &amp; Co.,  and Messrs.  Holme &amp; Co.)  have  suffered specially severe losses and Messrs.  Holme &amp; Co.,  who were agents in Naples  for the Orient Line, have now stated that they have been forced to close down their banking business and will probably shortly be obliged to close  down their shipping business.    These firms are likely to  suffer continuing hardship,  as  I  under- stand that no new foreign firms  are allowed  to  undertake this kind of shipping business in Italy.   Once they have closed down, they will  not be allowed  to  re-open their
businesses.  Moreover, under Italian law, they are obliged fcopay heavy compensation to their displaced employees.     As regards 3  (requests from individuals for compensatioi.in respect of loss of employment, etc), the number of enquiries received so far is not large  (about a dozen) butincludes several apparently genuine cases of hardship, s\:ch as,for example, British subjects employed for many years in italy in connection with United Kingdom trade who have now been deprived of their means of livelihood.     I have already circulated a brief note (CP. 54 !&apos;36))     /comparing our trade with Italy in January 1935 and 1936,showing a reduction of imports by over  600,000 and of exportsof United Kingdom goods of over  700,000.  Unless and until this trade can be diverted to other channels (which at most canonly be partially effected and will in any case take time), the traders concerned are bound to suffer.     The question of the provision of sterling for the liquidation of trade debts will, of course, have to be taken up with the Italian Government in the general negotiations whichwill, no doubt, take place when the application of sanctionsto Italy is withdrawn and in the meantime creditors in theUnited Kingdom can only be informed that it is the intention ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to raise the question of liquidationwith the Italian Government as soon as a favourable opportunityarises for doing so.     I fear that the grant of compensation to  British firmswhose trade has been injured or destroyed,  or  to individuals who have been deprived of their means of livelihood, as aresult of the application of sanctions,  would  be impracticableif only for the reason that it would lead to requests for compensation for loss of trade or employment due to other causes;  nor would it appear possible for Parliament to beasked to provide funds for the  grant of compensation in caarcaof special hardship (such as the case of British shipping                            -3-                          ;
titD 406agents in Italy referred to above) without, at the same time,providing for compensation over a wider  field.   In this view                                                               I                                                               ithe Treasury concur.                                            j     It is to he anticipated,  however,  that the pressure onHis Majesty&apos;s Government to grant some  form of compensation forllosses due directly to the application  of sanctions will increase the longer sanctions  remain in force.                                     W.R.                    /  IBoard of  Trade,    5th March,  1935.
