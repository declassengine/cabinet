    THIS DOCUMENT  IS&apos; THE&apos; PROPERTY  OF: HIS. BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOTMftOlENT.                         C A BIN E  T. SECRET.                                             Copy NoV/ C.P,55(36).                   THE ippS^pF^I.IVING  INEEX NtMBER.                Memorandum by  the Minister of Labour,     At the Cabinet  meeting on 5th February  (Cabt,  4-  (56)  6) certain points arising out of  the proposal that  the  basis of the cost-of-living index number should  be revised were  referred for consideration by  the Minister of Labour, in  conjunction  with the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister  of Health,  and the Secretary of  State  for Scotland.  Qrne following is a summary of  our conclusions which are given more  fully in the attached Note:- 1,   The basis  of the eost^of-living index number is obsolete,  and revision cannot be much  longer deferred.  For this purpose an enquiry into  working- class expenditure  is essential.0 2.   The enquiry would provide information urgently required for other purposes. The Committee on Diet and Nutrition have asked that it shall be  collected,  and in our judgment this request cannot be refused.   The information would alsobe valuable in  connection with the League of Nations enquiry into  nutrition, and to the Departments  of Agriculture, 3.   Difficulties which might arise if a revision of the basis  of  the cost-of-living  index involved a breath in the continuity of the existing series of figures could  be  avoided by linking on the revised index numbers to those previously published, so as to provide a continuoiis series, 4.   The detailed  results of the enquiry into working-class expenditure will no doubt be compared with those of the similar enquiry made by  the Board of Trade in 1904,  and they may be used to direct attention to the low consumption of certain foods by  some sections of the working-classes.   But existing data are already being  used for this latter purpose,  and authoritative information will soon be essential to test their accuracy.   An enquiry primarily for the purpose of the cost-of-living index number is preferable to one confined to questions of nutrition,  which would create the maximum of  difficulty. 5.   In these circumstances we concur in the  view that an  enquiry primarily for the purpose of the cost-of-living index,  should be instituted immediately,                                   1.
338and we  suggest that there should be an announcement in the form of a replyto a Question in the House, in the following terms:-     Question. - To ask the Minister of Labour whether he proposes to revise     the basis of the Cost-of-Living Index Number?     Reply. -  Yes, Sir.   I have recently given further consideration to     this matter and have decided that a revision of the &quot;basis of the     Cost-of-Living Index Number should now &quot;be undertaken.   For this purpose,     it will be necessary to collect data with regard to the distribution of     the main items of expenditure of working-class households at the     present time.  An enquiry of this character, on a scale sufficiently     comprehensive to provide representative information covering different     seasons of the year, cannot be completed before the autumn of next year.     In the meantime, the cost-of-living index number will continue to be     calculated on the existing &quot;basis, and I anticipate that the new index     number can &quot;be so linked on to the previous numbers as to continue the     series without a &quot;break.  I should add that, as regards the methods to     &quot;be adoxsted in the conduct of the enquiry, I hope to have the assistance     of a small advisory committee which will include representatives of     employers and trade unions,6.   We suggest tho following terms of reference for the proposed AdvisoryCommittee (the appointment of which will be essential if the results of theenquiry are to be accepted by the trade unions)          &quot;To advise the Minister of Labour as to the methods to be adopted     in tho collection of information, by moans of family budgets,  showing     the approximate average weekly expenditure of working-class families on     the items which should be taken into account in the construction of index     numbers designed to measure the percentage changes,  from month to month,     in the cost of maintaining a present-day standard of living&quot;.7.   The suggested constitution of tho Advisory Committee is indicated inparagraph 9 of the attached note.

                  Cost  of. Lj:yin LIndex Number.          Note by the Mnisters  of Agriculture., Health and Labour                 arid the  Secretary of State for Scotland. 1.   We have  given careful consideration to the questions which were referred to  us  at  the  meeting of the Cabinet on 5th February with regard to the proposal  that the basis of the cost-of-living index number should be revised and that  for  that purpose an enquiry should be made into the distribution of working-class expenditure.                      The case for an Enquiry, 2.   The  primary object of the enquiry would be to provide material for a revision  of the basis of  the Ministry of Labour index number of changes in working-class costs  of living.   There is an increasing volume of criticism of  this index number, on  the ground that it is calculated by reference to a standard  of living,  established  twenty to thirty years ago, which is now obsolete,  A  committee of the Economic Advisory Council reported, in 1931, that revision was necessary, and we are advised that on statistical grounds the continued retention of so old a basis can no longer be defended.   As the index number is very vri.dely used in the regulation of wages,  it is clearly undesirable that it should be allowed to fall into disrepute, andwe are agreed that if public confidence in its validity is to be  retained, a revision  of its basis cannot be much longer deferred .  To obtain the data required  for  this purpose an enquiry into the present-day distribution ofworking-class expenditure will be essential. 5.   The need for an enquiry of this kind is  now becoming especially  urgentfor other reasons.   The Advisory Committee on Diet and Nutrition, appointed in July last &quot;to enquire into the facts in relation to the  diet of  thepeople and to report as to any changes  which  appear desirable&quot;, have  found the available data inadequate for their purpose, and have asked that  early steps shall be taken to collect family  budgets and to undertake dietary surveys on an extensive scale,  in order to provide the information  they require.  Both on merits and on political grounds  it  will in  our  judgmentbe impossible to refuse this request.   Moreover, the  League of Nations  are
committed to an investigation on the subject of nutrition in relationto health and the consumption of agricultural products, as a result ofa resolution adopted by the Assembly with the support of the Britishand Dominion delegates, and for this purpose information will be required as to food consumptions  The Agricultural Marketing Boards and theDepartments of Agriculture are also specially interested in obtainingdata relating to actual and potential markets.  In the absence of anyrecent official collection of budgets of family expenditure, the investigation of these problems is being greatly hampered by the paucity ofthe existing data, and the proposed enquiry into working-class expenditure,for the purpose of a revision of the cost of living index number, would havethe great advantage of providing as a by-product, authoritative informationbearing on these questions.                         Possible Difficulties.4.   Yftiile the data obtained would thus be of high value for a variety of purposes, certain points of difficulty may arise when the enquiry is completed,  We have given special consideration to these points, whicharc discussed below.5.   In the first place, it is to be noted that a revision of the costof living index which involved a breach in the continuity of the existingseries of figures would introduce complications in the provisions ofmany collective agreements, between employers and workpeople, under whichrates of wages are automatically varied, from time to time in accordancewith the movements of the index number.  We think it is essential thatefforts should be made to avoid this difficulty by arranging that the revised index numbers shall be linked on to those previously published insuch a way as to provide a continuous series;  we believe this can be  done and for practical purposes it will be sufficient.  In order to avert any possibility of misapprehension on the part of the employers&apos;  and workers&apos;organisations concerned, we suggest that the announcement that an enquiry is to be instituted with a view to a revision of the basis of the indexshould contain an assurance on this point.
                                                                      341 6.   A further point for consideration is the use which may ho made, in some quarters, of the results of the enquiry in order to direct public attention  to the relatively low consumption of certain kinds of food, among certain sections of the working -classes.  For the purpose of a revision of the basis of the cost of living index number only general averages showing the relative expenditure on each of the principal items in the working-class budget would be required.  But in order to provide tho particulars necessary for the consideration of questions relating to diet and nutrition, and the consumption of agricultural products, some further analysis of the data would be necessary, and demands would no doubt be made for the publication of the results of the enquiry in considerable detail.When a similar enquiry was made by the Labour Department of the Board of Trade in 1904, in order to provide information as to the condition of the working classes in connection with the fiscal controversy then in progress, a detailed analysis of the results was published55 showing the average consumption of, and expenditure on, each of the principal items of foodwith separate figures for groups of families with different ranges of income, and for different areas.   There will probably be considerable pressure for the inclusion of similar details in the report giving the results of a new enquiry;  and the data relating to the food consumption of the lower-paidfamilies, and families with several dependent children, may be used as abasis for propaganda,7.   While we recognise that inconvenience  may be  caused by the publication of a detailed analysis of the results of the enquiry,  we do not think that this could be regarded as a sufficient reason for  resisting the demands for a revision of the basis of  the cost of living index, and we think it would be specially difficult to justify a refusal to collect the data which have  been asked for5f&quot;Memoranda, Statistical Tables,  etc,  bearing on British and Foreign  Trade and Industrial Conditions - Second Series&quot; - Cd.2537 of 1904.
                                                                         9 A 9                                                                         5 LI &amp;by  the Committee on Diet and Nutrition.   There is already sufficient material in  the results of a number of local enquiries which have been made by variousindividuals and organisations to serve the purposes of those who are concerned only with propaganda, and there are indications that the Government may soonfind it essential to have in its possession information enabling the accuracyto  be tested of inferences which are at present being drawn from such data as are available.   A situation of some difficulty might be created, both forthe Advisory Committee on Nutrition and for the Ministry of Health, if thepublic demand for information as to whether such figures as are now being used are substantially accurate could not be satisfied either by theproduction of official figures or by an assurance that an enquiry is beingmade.   It seems to us, moreover, that an enquiry instituted primarily forthe purpose of obtaining material for a revision of the cost of living index number, but adapted, so far as practicable, to yield information bearing on questions of nutrition as a by-product, is much to be preferred to two separate enquiries, each related to different aspects of these related questions.Indeed, it seems to us that to have an enquiry confined to questions of nutrition would be to create the maximum of difficulty.                               Suggested Announcement.8.   In these circumstances, we think that an enquiry must be instituted andthat it should be conducted so as to deal with the requirements of the Ministryof Labour and the Ministry of Health.    The necessary announcement could best be made in the form of a reply to a Question in the House of Commons.   Wesuggest that the question and reply should be in the following  terms:-Sugg e sted que sti on:-     To ask the Minister of Labour whether he proposes to revise the  basis ofthe Cost of Living Index Number?Suggested reply:-     Yes, Sir.   I have recently given further consideration to this  matterand have decided that a revision of the basis of the Cost-of-Living index number should now be undertaken.    For this purpose,  it  will be necessary to collect data with regard to the distribution of the main items of expenditure
 of working class households at the present time.   An enquiry of this character, on a scale sufficiently comprehensive to provide representative information covering different seasons of the year, cannot be completed before the autumn of next year.   In the meantime, the cost-of-living.index number will continue to be calculated on the existing basis, and I anticipate that the new index number can be so linked on to the previous numbers as to continue the series without a break.   I should add that, as regards the mathods to be adopted in the conduct of the enquiry, I hope to have the assistance of a small advisory committee which will include representatives of employers and trade unions.                    The Proposed Advisory Committee. 9.   when  proposals for a revision of the basis of the cost of living indexwere previously under consideration, in 1931, the Trades Union congress general Council expressed the opinion that there should be a central committeeto advise the Ministry of Labour on the enquiry as a whole, and that theTrades Union Congress General Council should be adequately represented.    Asit is essential that the material to be collected should be generally accepted as representative, and there is little prospect of its acceptance bythe trade unions unless they are given the opportunity  to satisfy themselves that the details of the enquiry are so planned as to eliminate bias, we  agree &quot;that it will be necessary to. appoint such a committee.    It will be necessary,however,  to ensure that the function of the Committee should be  carefullydefined and restricted to the giving of advice and opinion on questions relating to the details of the enquiry, and to the methods by which it is tobe carried out;  with this object we suggest that its terms of reference shouldbe on the following lines:-          &quot;To advise the Minister of Labour as to the methods to be     adopted in the collection of information, by means of family budgets,     showing the approximate  average weekly expenditure of working-class     families on the items which should be  taken into account in the     construction of index numbers designed to measure  the percentage changes,     from month to month,  in  the cost of maintaining a  present-day standard     of living.&quot;
     We recommend that the Committee should include,  in addition toDepartmental representatives,  and one or two Statisticians,  a woman,  arepresentative of employers,  of the trade union movement,  of the retails traders!organisations, and of the Co-operative movement.     This Advisory Committee  would not remain in.existence after the preparations for the enquiry  have been completed, nor would  it be asked toadvise, or assist, in the compilation of the statistics giving the results ofthe enquiry.                                                                                t                       The duration of the enquiry.                                                                                I10.  As it will be necessary  to obtain i^articulars of expenditure for at least  I                                                                                1four separate weeks at different seasons of the year, and  a  considerableamount of time will be required for the necessary preparatory work and forthe preparation of the statistics,  the full results of the enquiry cannot  beavailable for at least eighteen months, and it is improbable that a revisionof the cost of living index number can be completed before the end of 1937,at the earliest.   We think it is desirable that this should be clearly understood from the outset, and we  have therefore included an intimation to      Hthis effect in the announcement which we have proposed should be given inreply to a Question in the House of Commons.    The interval of eighteen months  mor two years which will elapse between the date of the announcement and the revision of the cost of living index number will no doubt be useful inenabling the employers1  and workers&apos;  organisations,  who are parties tocollective agreements under which wages are regulated by the cost of living index, to make any preparations which may be necessary well in advance of thefirst issue of the index figures on the revised basis.905-65 B.P.
