THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT                                                         1Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1936.Copy No.CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN  TREATY.    I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith the text of the instructions whichit is proposed to send to Sir Miles Lampson for his guidance in the forthcomingtreaty negotiations.                                                                    A.  E.    Foreign Office, February  17, 1936.SECRET.CP. 48  (36).                                     (1)                   Mr. Eden to Sir Miles Lampson (Cairo).     1.  THE Cabinet haye approved the programme suggested by you for yourconfidential preliminary conversations with Egyptian negotiators on the militaryprovisions of an eventual Anglo-Egyptian treaty of alliance.   You should there-fore now begin the conversations on the basis already laid down by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and accepted by the Egyptian Government.  This basis is that they areundertaken on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the object of arriving atan Anglo-Egyptian treaty settlement, and that in view of the paramount import-ance of its military provisions, the two Governments, with the help of their military advisers, propose now to discuss confidentially and  as potential allies the applica-tion of the military terms  of the 1930 draft treaty to the changed situation  ofto-day.   You should yourself lead the  conversations on behalf  of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  with  the assistance  of the Commander-in-Chief,  mediterranean fleet, or his  representative, the  General Officer  Commanding British Troops  inEgypt and the Air Officer  Commanding, Middle East, as technical experts, andof the Counsellor  and Oriental  Secretary  of  His Majesty&apos;s  Residency.  you should arrange so far  as possible that the conversations should be conducted onthe Egyptian side by not more than the equivalent  number of  Egyptian represen-tatives.   You should make clear at the outset to the  Egyptian negotiators thatthe basis on which both parties have undertaken the conversations is that stated above.   After opening remarks in the  sense  of my  immediately succeedingtelegram, you should then endeavour to proceed by  progressive stages on the linesof the programme suggested by you and approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government.This is to say that you should in the first  instance  :      (A)  Put  forward as a formula that until such time as Egypt, to  the satis-f action of both parties, is in a position herself adequately to assume the protectionof her own territory, it should be agreed that the forces (naval,  military and air)of the two parties should be regarded as pooled in the common  interest with the corollary of no  limitation  as to numbers, dispositions, &amp;c.  You should, as a first move,  suggest this formula  for exploration and study with a view to yourexpert advisers  securing an  opportunity  to explain to the  Egyptian  represen-tatives from a technical point of view as officials of a potentially allied Govern-ment and on the assumption of joint interests the precise strategical caonsiderations and lessons to be drawn from the situation  arising out of recent Italian  action and  the present  joint Anglo-Egyptian defensive measures.  (But  here seeparagraph 11 below, Suez Canal.)      8366   [12746]
     2.   Should this  line of approach prove abortive you should then (B) fall back on offering as concessions the evacuation of the Citadel and of Kasr-el-Nil Barracks by the British troops in Cairo and their withdrawal to Abbassia and Helmia.  Your proposals for maintaining British troops in the two last-named localities should be based on arguments of joint strategical interest in virtue of the  advantages they  offer from the point of view of communications,  as a base for  reserves, &amp;c, and on the  value to the Egyptian troops of daily contact and training beside British forces.  It would be  necessary to elaborate in detail in the  experts&apos; discussions  the  full  requirements of  training facilities  and the provision at the expense of the Egyptian Government of the alternative barrack accommodation, &amp;c,  on the lines of the Annex to article 9 of the 1933 draft for a treaty.   The  above proposal postulates the retention  of British troops at the Canal and at or in the neighbourhood of Alexandria.     3.  If this proposal in its turn proves unobtainable you will then propose, (C)  that the British troops in Cairo (including Abbassia and Helmia) should be withdrawn  to  Helouan (or some  equally central and more technically suitable point),  but that British troops should be retained at the Canal and at or in the neighbourhood of Alexandria.     4.  Of the above three, suggestions (A) should be regarded as representing the maximum, (C) the minimum, of proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   His Majesty&apos;s Government view proposal (C) with no great favour, more particularly because once they have committed themselves to the course implied thereby, it will be difficult ever  to withdraw from it.   Therefore, should  you be beaten back  from (A)  and find that you are being driven from (B) also, you should refer to me in good time before putting (C) to the Egyptian negotiators as the last word of His Majesty&apos;s Government.  At the same time I do not wish in any way to fetter your discretion if you should find, in the course of your discussions, that there is a prospect of securing agreement on the lines of that proposal.  One of the primary considerations in selecting an alternative site is the health and general welfare b-f His  Majesty&apos;s Forces.  The Delta would be  unsuitable on grounds of health and  aJso from the point of view of training facilities.     5.  It will probably be desirable for tactical and psychological reasons to give the offer of withdrawal from the Citadel and the Kasr-el-Nil Barracks as much as possible the  character of a spontaneous goodwill  offer on  the part  of  His Majesty&apos;s Government.  For this reason you will perhaps think it desirable that your action under Stage (A) should be in the nature of an exploration of the mood of the Egyptians, so that if after exploring the ground, you feel satisfied that the atmosphere is unfavourable for the adoption of such a general arrangement, the psychological effect of your suggestion under Stage (B) to abandon the Citadel and Kasr-el-Nil Barracks  should not be impaired.     6.  As a make-weight in the discussions you are about to undertake,  you should remind  the Egyptian  negotiators that as the  result of  a treaty Egypt will  be enabled to modernise and increase the strength of her army.     7.  It is important that you should make it clear to the Egyptian represen- tatives from the beginning that each of the proposals which you will put forward depends for its validity on agreement  being reached on all points, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government must retain a free hand in respect of agreed portions of their proposals if on other portions there should be failure to agree.  You should make this intimation  in a friendly manner, not by way  of a threat or in order to coerce  the Egyptian  negotiators,  but as a  natural  precaution designed to safeguard the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government.     8.  In general, with a view  to securing the desiderata, of His Majesty&apos;s Government  under Stage (A) desiderata which, in their view, correspond tothe common  interests of this  country and of Egypt,  as clearly emphasised by recent events you should at the outset  endeavour to create a feeling of confidence in the minds of the Egyptian representatives by bringing  home to them that what his  Majesty&apos;s Government aim at securing is general collaboration between the two countries in the defence of their common interests in Egypt.  You should at the same time disabuse the Egyptian representatives of any idea they may have that  His Majesty&apos;s Government look on the armies otherwise than as potential
allies against external aggression or that the proposals you will make are inspired by any desire to obtain, for the British forces a position of control for the purposeof dominating the Egyptians and the Egyptian Government.    9.  The  foregoing is intended to provide you with the general line for theconduct of the preliminary conversations.  The following paragraphs give you for your guidance the desires of His Majesty&apos;s Government in particular matters.The comments of  the C.I.D. (CP. 25&apos; (36) )  on the conclusions of  the COS.(C.I.D.  1212-B,  paragraph 39) contained in  a paper which, will already be inyour possession have been approved  by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and in thelight  of these comments you should,  subject to the following observations inrespect  of certain  of them,  seek to  attain  the objects  particularised in theConclusions,  the wording  of  which is not intended to be appropriate to use in negotiations.   A perusal of the paragraphs of the C.O.S. report in C.I.D. 1212-Bwhich precede paragraph 39  will  indicate  the  considerations  on  which theConclusions are based.  But -they should be  read strictly in the  light of the comments of  the C.I.D. in CP.  25 and of the observations thereon set out below.    10.   CP. 25  (36).   (General.)   Paragraphs 5  and  6. These  should be interpreted, as far as concerns the point regarding the League  of Nations, as meaning that it  is undesirable in an eventual treaty  specifically  to mentionreference  of  a dispute  between His  Majesty&apos;s  Government and the  egyptian government to the League of Nations in  connexion with the duration or revisionof the Treaty.    11.   P paragraph 8. Conclusion  (d) of the Chiefs of Staffs report, which is approved,  should  not, however, be  interpreted as necessarity prohibiting the granting of permission to the Egyptian Government to station a small number oftroops (e.g., a battalion or a few companies) within the Canal Zone as an earnest of the sincerity of the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government for  co-operation with egypt as an ally, but this would only be permitted on the  distinct understandingthat no abrogation or  weakening was  involved  of  the  responsibility  of  HisMajestj^s Government for the security of the Suez Canal.    12.  Paragraph 9. The word   armed &quot; should be substituted  for the word&quot; militarjr.&quot;   The object of this amendment  is to make  it clear that naval andair force  as well  as  armv support   is  envisaged.  (See  paragraph  35 ofC.I.D. 1212-B.)    13.  Paragraph 11. -As you  are  aware, a draft convention on this point hasbeen drawn up by the competent Departments  of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    14.  Paragraphs 12  and  13. These  points might  be  dealt  with  in an exchange of notes on the lines of the 1933 draft.    15.  (Military)  Paragraphs  14-19. These are covered by paragraphs 1-4of the present telegram.    16.  (Air.)  Paragraph  21. This should be read as approving  all the airrequirements referred to under  heading &quot; air  &quot; of CP. 25.    17.  Paragraph 22. You will probably find it impossible to deal with thesematters in detail  during these preliminary  conversations, but the matters inquestion and points connected  therewith should be borne in mind.   As regards&quot; the establishment of martial law in the Canal Zone when necessary, it may bedesirable to seek agreement providing for joint martial law, not only in the canal zone, but also in Egypt generally, but I hope to communicate with you further on  this  point.    February   ,  1936.                                     (2)   -                    Mr. Eden to Sir M. Lampson (Cairo).    MY immediately preceding telegram.    Following are the lines on which you should make your opening remarks :-    Nearly all Egyptian  political parties  having formed a body united in itsexpressed desire for the conclusion of a Treaty between our two&quot; countries,  His
  Majesty&apos;s Government are happy to renew with the Egyptian Government their  efforts to  settle  the questions which  have hitherto been  left  outstanding.  Negotiations with this object have taken place in the past, but they have proved  abortive.  It is incumbent upon us to spare no effort to avoid a repetition of these  failures, and it is the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s  Government, as it is their ardent  hope,  that on this occasion,  by the exercise of patience and understanding, and  the display of determined goodwill on both sides, it will be possible to reach an  agreement which  will satisfy the individual and joint  interests and  aims of our  two countries.      For their part His  Majesty&apos;s Government will  not be found  wanting in  goodwill, and they are confident that the same  is true of the  Egyptian Govern-  ment.   I am sure the cordial relations and the confidence which have for long  existed between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the  Government of Egypt, and  which the emphasis given by recent events to the community of our  fundamental  interests has augmented,  are  an earnest of the spirit in which both sides are  entering upon  the  present  preliminary  discussions.  I  have referred  to the  unfortunate failures of the  past.   With a view of  removing at the outset the  obstacles to an  agreement, it has been decided that as  a preliminary to negotia-  tions for a treaty settlement  we should discuss confidentially the matters  which  gave most difficulty on the occasion of the negotiations of 1930, and it will be the  object of our present conversations to see how far we can reach agreement on  these matters by discussion in the spirit of potential allies and in the light  of the  experience gained by  recent  events.  If we find that on these lines agreement is  assured, we can,  I  feel  sure, go  forward with  the  greater  confidence to the  undertaking of negotiations for a treaty.      His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore instruct me to express their keen  desire, . for a successful outcome of our discussions. They look forward to the time when  as a result of  a Treaty freely entered  into by both parties a new  era will be  established in  the relations  of our two countries, an  era  when, Egypt having  assumed her complete sovereignty  and the grounds for past misunderstandings  having been removed,  they will appear before the world as allies and equals.      February 1936.o
