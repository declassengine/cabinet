THIS fjOOUMENT Is THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.5SCRET!.P.57(56)CABINET.COPY NO.   f\)DEFENCE PROGRAMMES - LABOUR ISSUES INVOLVED.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.    A preliminary reading  of papers  CP.26(36)  and D.R.C.37  convinced me thatthe labour  aspect  of  the  defence programme is  of such paramount importance&apos; thatit  requires special consideration by  the  appropriate Committee of Ministers.It  would be impossible  for  me, without  further examination and reflection, toI am having one prepared immediately in my Department which I should hope wouldbe ready for early consideration.    I think it necessary, however, at once to putsome of the immediate problems as  I see them before my colleagues as indicating the gravity of the problem as it strikes me at first sight.2.   If the defence programme is to be carried through to the extent and atthe time indicated, it is obviously essential that the requisite supply of allclasses of labour should be available.    The first question, therefore, to bedetermined is whether there is at  present a shortage in respect of the trades which would be principally affected, and how far that shortage is likely to-be intensified as the programme gathers impetus.   If a present or prospective shortageis established, a number of problems of the first order of difficulty will immediately arise.    Upon this point, until the nature of the demand translated intoterms of labour has been closely examined, it is impossible for me to give any definite guidance.   I can however state at once that when a similar problem was first discussed by my Department with the Air Ministry at the inception of theirextended programme, an analysis of the skilled men in all occupations in theEngineering trades was made.   As  a result it was discovered that the total available in every class was 27,000.   when these were scaled down by specialexamination, they were reduced to  14,000.    It was further calculated by the AirMinistry that their demands might  be somewhere in the nature of 8,000 or 9,000.It appeared therefore at that stage that there was likely to be a shortage inrespect of the Air Ministry programme alone., because it was not reasonable to suppose that all, or even the large majority of these men would necessarily be                                                                                     iavailable where they were required.   A further enquiry was instituted a month ago   discover how far the position had changed since the first enquiry.   These results?are not yet fully available, but the preliminary reports received from the variousput forward a considered memorandum on so complicated and far-reaching a subject.
Divisions of the Ministry of Labour indicate, particularly in the SouthEastern area, a growing shortage affecting nearly all classes of skilled menin the engineering trade.   Similar enquiries have been instituted in respectof shipbuilding, building and iron and steel.   In the case of shipbuildingthere has been no immediate indication of shortage, but there is reason toapprehend a serious shortage when the new programme comes into operation.   in building, there has been an appreciable shortage during the summer months incertain occupations.   Even if there is some diminution in the amount ofspeculative building during the next year, it is probable that the shortage will still be significant.   In the iron and steel trades fears were expressed bySir Yfllliam Larke as to a shortage, which has not yet been borne out by myDepartment&apos; s investigatipnso&quot;   Here again, however, the position mayberadically altered by the programme.3.   I have therefore already enough evidence to indicate that shortage in the key trades of the vital industries is to be apprehended.   I mention here that lord Yfeir in his memorandum speaks of 120,000 additional men being requiredfor the programme.   It will be necessary to analyse this figure into skilled,semi-skilled and unskilled.   In itself it is a sufficiently formidable figure.It is, I suggest, essential that an immediate intensive enquiry should be madein terms of the probable demands, so that the true nature of the problem in this aspect may be appreciated.   If, as a result of that investigation, the seriousshortages which I expect are revealed, steps to remedy the shortage will be inevitable, and they will have to be considered at the earliest possible moment.These steps include such diverse methods as,     (a) Training to fill the gaps.   The problem of training is completely         different so far as the highest skilled and semi-skilled-men are         concerned.   So far as the latter are affected, my Department has very         largely increased, in consultation with the Air Ministry, its provisions         for the training of semi-skilled engineers, with the result that it may         be hoped that as many as 10,000 will be trained within a year.   So far         as the skilled men are concerned, the training scheme must rest
        primarily with the employers, because such men can only really be        trained under factory conditions.   It is essential that this matter        should be discussed at the earliest date, when the shortage has been        discovered, with the appropriate organisations.   It may be noted in        passing that one of the factors in this would be provision of refresher        courses for skilled men who have been long unemployed.    (b)  The next step, if it is not possible rapidly enough to increase the        supply by training, will be to consider reorganisation within industry        itself.   I mean by this first that skilled men should be used        exclusively only for the higher skilled work, and secondly that some        measure of upgrading and division of processes should be introduced.        It would be appreciated that the second of those proposals, if it        becomes necessary, will inevitably lead to prolonged discussions with        the Trade Unions, and unless successfully handled may lead to serious        labour difficulties.    (c)  Another possibility which may have to be considered if the shortage        4*  acute enough, is taking the contract to the men rather than the men        to the contract.   I mean by this that it may be necessary to consider        using up pockets of older skilled men who cannot be moved,  in their        home districts.   I recognise the difficulties of this, but just as it        may be necessary for employers to use men of loss skill than may be        desired, it may become necessary to use contractors of less specialised        experience than was intended.4-.   I indicate these merely as some of the obvious steps to be taken as regardssupply of labour.   There will also be serious labour problems concerning wagesand the ^^mfei^lyfe^ of disputes.   So far as wages are concerned,  there is likelyto be particular difficulty in the engineering industry whoa the Unions have acurrent claim which they will certainly press.   There has been a recent increase of wages in shipbuilding but this will not prevent demands being madefor a further increase later.     There are already indications that employers who cannot   obtain labourelsewhere arc beginning to raise wages in competition with one another.                                  3.
 This particular feature of the situation, which produced, the greatest abuses during the wax&apos;, will have to be radically considered. 5.    It is not inconceivable that a position might ax&quot;isc in which rationing of skilled labour between the various supply services will  have  to be  settled.   The machinex-y for carrying this out will require  careful consideration.      It must be remembered further- that however largo  the defence programme, the ordinary programme  on civilian work is larger still.   It is therefore vital as is recognised  already in the  cireulated papers that in any proposals the most careful regard should be had to the needs of the export and general trade. 6.    What I have stated above I think  clearly indicates the  difficulty and complexity of the  problem..    The question of a.ppropx&quot;iate action now follows. I suggest that  in  the first place  the  whole problem should be - considered immediately by  the  appropriate Committee  of Ministers.    Beyond that  it is I think clear that from the point  of view of such questions  as  priority of demnnds in terms of labour&quot;, wages   px-oblcms,  and all aspects of meeting the shortage,  some  central  co-ox-dinating body is dcsix-able.    It is obviously essential that  the  Ministry of Labour  should be  represented  upon that body. I can not  sufficiently familiar with the  structure of the  C.I.D. organisation to  make too definite  a. suggestion on this  point.   As  far as I can understand,  it seems  to me that  it  would be appropriate for theMinistry  to be represented  from this point  of view on the principal Supply-Officers&apos;  Committee and on  the  Central Supply Board.    I  would  mention in this connection  that it was found  vital during the wax-  in all departments concerned with  supply to give  the  labour  departments a  sufficientlyauthoritative position  to enable them  to be  of real service  to  the  supply department s,      It may be  that some special ad hoc Committee may be  added  for-  thepurposes  of  general labour  policy.   I leave  this point with the major questions  of policy for determination  by  the  Committee  of Ministers to which I have;  already  referred.
     In addition to what I have said above there are certain points of detail affecting the Ministry of Labour which arc not quite correctlyset out in the eieewlajt^&quot;notably the part it plays m connection withrecruiting for the Forces to which I shall wish to call attention at theproper time, but I need not enlarge upon this now.Clntd. ) E.B.21st February, 1936.H.Q.926-65 B.F.
