4 (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT), SECRET. C.P.57.(36),                                       COPY NO. 4* &amp;  .                            CABINET.                      CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air..           I am not in agreement with the Secretary&apos;s conclusions, and I do not think that the arguments advanced in his memorandum or the conclusions really deal with the problem which we have to face.           The present proposals have little or nothing in common with a Ministry of Defence.   I am opposed to a Ministry of Defence.   I do not think that either in peace or in war a single Minister would he able to take executive charge of the three Departments^   The large and complicated supply problems, which each Minister has to face at the present time, add force ,to the objections to this plan.           The new proposal, as I understand it, is quite different. It is that a Minister without Portfolio should act as Deputy Chairman of the C.I.D; should be Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee; and I would certainly add, should be in charge of the supply organisation of the C.I.D. as distinct from the supply departments of the Service Ministries,           The Secretary&apos;s memorandum assumes that the present system works perfectly, and yields the best possible results.. Both smooth working and results under the present system owe a great deal to Sir Maurice Hankey.   He is in name secretary of the Chiefs of Staff Committee; he is in fact, by reason of his long and unique experience, much more like a chairman; and when a formal chairman is required, as In the case of the D.R., Committee, he is the obvious chairman *   There is, however, no se-cond Hankey in the worlds
                       2jf          But can we truly say that the system worksperfectly even now?   Is compromise to avoid difficultiesrather than to face them unknown?   New issues must cutacross traditional policy and traditional prejudices.   the function of a chairman should not &quot;be to dictate policy,, hutto ensure that every aspect is fully considered,  and that difficulties and differences are frankly faced.   He shouldevoke the &quot;best that each Chief of Staff can give; and where there is a genuine difference of opinion, should express a judicial view, and present the whole case fairlyto the C.I.D. and to the Cabinet.   Is it not easier forthe Chiefs of Staff &quot;both to differ and to agree in thepresence of a wise and unprejudiced Chairman?   I believethat the presence of such a man would make their positioneasier as between themselves and vis-a-vis their ownServices.          There is no reason why the Chairman should usurpthe functions of the Prime Minister or undermine hisposition.   The Chairman&apos;s work is largely secret; and wemust surely assume, what is happily today the fact, thatwe play as a loyal team.   Can it be pretended that thePrime Minister can give, throughout his term of office, allthat is needed of his time and mind, if he is to do whatthe proposed Minister would do?   How could the PrimeMinister, for example, when the House is sitting, havegiven the thought and  time which he has in fact given to theDefence Requirements Committee?   And J3t that was a uniqueoccasion of supreme importance.          Given a judicial colleague, in whom we all have confidence, why should.there be difficulties with service ministers?   Issues on which Ministers differ are argued
out today on Cabinet Committees.   If necessary., we differ from the Chairman or the Committee.   But it is surelybetter to face our difficulties, if difficulties there are,frankly in this way; and more often we get genuine agreement.          Nor do I see why the problem of dual control should arise in war.   In war the Prime Minister and theWar Cabinet take supreme and daily control-, and the peaceorganisation merges in and becomes subordinate to thatsupreme contro 1.          Policy and supply are closely related.   I believethat it will be necessary for a Minister to take charge ofthe supply organisation.   Nor do I think there will he oVer-lapplng or conflict between that supply organisation andthat Minister and the supply organisation in the service departments and the Service Ministers.   If a Minister hasto cUal with the supply organisation, it is natural that heshould be the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff  Committee.In regard to supply, I assume a Minister who will not try to dominate and dictate to the Services in regard to their properfunctions..          The combined Staff,   I do not conceive that what is proposed is a separate,- parallel, conflicting staff.That would he quite unworkable.   What I conceive is proposedis a whole-time combined staff working to the Chiefs ofStaff Committee,.   I believe that a whole-time staff, very likely quite small, is necessary because existing staffsare getting more and more overworked.   We have found,for example, in supply, that It was quite impossible for officers with a mass of departmental work, ever-increasing,to do their regular work and run the supply organisation as members of committees in addition.    A separate whole-timesupply organisation has in consequence been built up.   Itdoes not cut across the Service Departments.    It is of the
4,11essence of the plan that the  staff  should he  a  combinedstaff.   Indeed,  that seems to me the  corollary of theImperial Defence  College.    It-is also  essential  that the combined staff should work to the Chiefs  of Staff Committee.The work of this  staff would be done for  and  submitted to theChiefs of Staff acting together.AIR MINISTRY.     10th February,  1936
