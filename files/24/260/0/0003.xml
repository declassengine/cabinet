DEFENCE  -CO-ORDINATlONo         Memorandum i ]pyM.the Ch an cell or of the Exchequer.            I have read the remarks by the Secretary to  the       Committee of  Imperial Defence circulated as&apos; 0oPo  30(36)       with great attention and with the respect which is due       to his unequalled authority and experience.    His con-       elusions indicate that in his opinion?  with the possible       exception of the subject of supplies in time of war,       there is no case for the appointment of a Minister of       Defence nor for any but minor changes in the existing       arrangements,            The arguments  and illustrations by which Sir Maurice       Hankey supports his thesis&apos; are so powerful and convincing       that the Cabinet may feel  that there is  nothing  more  to       be  said upon the subject-      Yet, much  as I  should like       to  be satisfied that  everything is as it should  be, I       cannot  feel entirely  at ease about certain aspects of the       situation on which,  as  it seems to me,  the last  word  has       not  yet been said.            In this short  Memorandum  I propose  to speak without       reserve,  since it is  the safety of the country which  we       have to consider  and  to that all  other considerations       must be subordinated.    Unless  I  state plainly the anxieties
 which are  occupying my mind it will  he  impossible to  remove  them either by  shewing  that they  are groundless  or  that they can be overcome by  appro- priate measures.      Let me  say at once that these anxieties  do not arise  out  of any fancied quarrels between Chiefs of staff  or want of  co-operation in  carry- ing out plans  or policies already decided on. Nor again do I subscribe  to  the idea which  the Secretary of the committee  of Imperial  Defence says  in paragraph 13 of his Memorandum  is being propagated? namely, that no  serious attempt is being made to adapt the Services to the newer methods of warfare.   On  the contrary,   I am satisfied that each Service  is ardently desirous of making itself as efficient as it can be  and that  only financial restrictions have -hitherto prevented the adoption of modern methods and equip- ment to a much greater extent than has  hitherto been the case.     My difficulty is of a different kind.    Inbrief, it is that whenever in planning  for a given series of operations there  is a choice of- the relative importance of the part to  be played by two or all of the  Services I do not  see  howunder present arrangements a completely objective view can be taken by  the men who  are  themselves the heads of services,  each with specific and sometimes even diverging responsibilities.-
No doubt this difficulty has always existed since we had a Navy and an Array, but it has become much more acutewith the advent of a new service which operates both oversea and land and, by reason of its newness, is undergoingchanges far more drastic and rapid than those which aretaking place in the older services.    it is in fact theproblems raised by the development of the Air porce and thepart which it could or- should play in future wars that is largely responsible for the agitation in the press andamongst a section of the public for a  Minister of Defence.described is hypothetical only and does not arise in practice this is in fact what is said in CP. 30(36).   but unfortunately my experience as a member of the ministerial committees which have det.lt with the Reports of the defence requirements committee does not enable me to subscribe tothis view.   It will be remembered that in November, 1933;,the Defence Requirements committee was desired by the thenCabinet to submit a programme for maicing good the deficiencies of our Defences and tiiat-this programme wasdulv submitted in CP. 64(34).   The proposals of theCommittee were thereupon examined by a Ministerial committeewhich came to the conclusion that, while parts of theprogramme, notably those concerning uie Army, could properly be spread over a much longer period than that contemplated by the committee, their proposals for the treatment of theAir porce were seriously under-estimated and must beIt may be said that the difficulty I havesubstantially increased.
       It will be observed that in this case the amend-ments in the Defence Requirements sub-committee&apos;s planmade by the Ministerial committee were based not on political but on military considerations, and that theywere right has been proved by what has happened since.indeed if the original proposals had been accepted thereis little doubt that the present position of the Airporce relative to the German Force would have been oneof grave and serious inferiority.       The cabinet has now before it a fresh report bythe pefence Requirements sub-committee and again amendments of their proposals are recommended by the ministerial committee&apos;.   These amendments are by no means of minor importance.   Once again they are based on military ratherthan political considerations and once again they tendtowards a substantial alteration in the role allotted tothe Air Force.       I am convinced that this alteration is right.I cannot belive that a new European war would be foughtin the same way as the Lust ^nd the articles by Mr. Mowrerquoted recently in the Times provide fresh evidence that german pirns are on the lines I have continually maintainedthey must be., namely to throw a highly mobile force round the end of the long line of French and Belgian fortificationsand to advance through Holland.   such a plan would nodoubt be -worked out carefully so as to ensure lightningspeed, and I should expect that air bases in the low countries would be established by the Germans long before we could get an expeditionary force across the sea.                      -4-
     If  this reasoning he correct, it surely stands  tosense that our policy should be to construct the mostterrifying deterrent    can think of, and recent advances in design of aircraft and engines give us the weaponsbest calculated to effect that purpose.   But the cabinet will note that the conversion of the Air Force from  a defensive organ into a weapon of aggression with unprecedent-dented powers of destruction did not form part of the plarsubinlttec! to the Ministerial Committee.     I believe that the sequence of events just describedis an illustration of the real weakness of the present arrangement.    The plans submitted to the ministerial committee have the appearance of an aggregate of three service plans, rather than a joint plan conceived ah initiijin the light of recent developments.   bio alternative was put before us, and there was no source from which such, analternative could be requested.     It may be that it is impossible to find any way by.which the present arrangements could he improved, and I annot saying that a Minister of defence with or without aseparate staff would have produced a better result.   ButI would suggest that an enquiry into the whole subjectmight throw more light upon it and that it would bemore satisfactory if we could be sure that every aspect of the present situation and every possible  alternativehad been thoroughly explored..(Intld.)
