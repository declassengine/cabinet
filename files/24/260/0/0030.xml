J 7 2)g DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEHEMENT . )ECRET.                   C A B I N E T .            Copy No. If....,P. 63(36) .            LICENSING (AMENDMENT)  BILL.                   Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary.        1.        This  Bill has been introduced by Mr.  Gledhill, M.P.        and  is  down for Second Reading on Friday,  March 6th.    The        Bill (of which  a copy is attached) is  understood to have been        promoted by certain organisations representing  club interests        including notably the Association of Conservative Clubs and        the  Working Men&apos;s Club and Institute Union.        2.        The first three  clauses of the Bill substantially        amend the law in regard to the &quot;permitted hours&quot; for  the sale        and  supply of intoxicants  in licensed  premises  and clubs.        The  total number of such hours is to he increased,  a  later        night &quot;closing  hour&quot; provided,  and the hours &quot;standardized&quot;        for  the whole of the country (England  and Wales) except that        London  and Cities with more  than 300,000 population are put        on a special footing.   Licensed premises  which can show a        certain percentage of non-alcoholic  sales,  and  &quot;bona  fide        residential clubs&quot;,  are to be  allowed  longer and later  hours        on weekdays;  other licensed premises  and  clubs  are to  he        allowed an extension at night  on twelve days in  the year of        their own choosing.    Sunday closing of licensed premises  in       Wales and Monmouthshire is apparently  to be abolished.        3.         The remainder of the  Bill  provides a  system of        further control  of the  registration  of  clubs for the purpose        of the  supply of  intoxicants.       4.         The Royal  Commission  on Licensing,  which  reported
at the end.of 1931, made a number of recommendations affectingboth licensed premises and clubs, but their Report has not yetbeen considered by the Government, and none of their recommendations have as yet been put into force.5.        Since the Commission&apos;s Report was issued severalattempts have been made to change the law by means of private members&apos; Bills.   Two of these Bills (the Standardization of hours Bill, introduced by Mr. J. C. Lockwood, and the Hotels and restaurants Bill, introduced by Mr. Bracewell Smith) obtained aSecond Reading and were considered in Committee.    After taking up a great deal of time in Committee (no less than 16 days inthe case of Mr. Lockwood&apos;s Bill) and causing not  only greattrouble to the Department but also much embarrassment to theGovernment, they were unable to make any further  progress.6.        A plausible case can no doubt be made out for reform of the law relating to &quot;permitted hours&quot; .    The proposals in theBill in this respect are,  however, controversial  in the extreme.Inter alia they involve fundamental changes in the existing system,   Under the Licensing Act, 1921, the hours for licensed premises are fixed (within certain statutory limits)  by the licensing justices in each district.   Under the  Bill the discretion of the justices is taken away,  and a rigid&quot;standardization&quot; of hours is substituted.7 .        A much stronger  case can be made out for the furthercontrol of the registration of clubs for the purpose  of thesupply of intoxicants.    Under the existing law the registration of clubs is purely automatic.   Any so-called club can obtainregistration by paying 5/- to the clerk to the justices,  whohas no discretion in the matter and must register the club.Cases of the prosecution  of &quot;bogus&quot;  olubs  - which are often
374 in effect  simply unlicensed  public houses,  and are  responsible for much drunkenness  -  are reported in  the  Press almost  daily; and the demand  for  further control is urged by a large body  of opinion including magistrates,  police,  the  licensed trade  (which suffer much from the  unfair  competition  of  the bogus  club) and temperance  organisations.    While, however,  the provisions in the Bill relating to  clubs are  acceptable in principle,  they are not adequate  for the  purpose  in view, and would need  extensive amendment. 8.        Apart,  however, from  the defects  of the present Bill, it  seems to me  that a subject so difficult  and complicated as the reform  of the licensing  system - a subject, moreover, which affects the  question  of public  order - cannot be dealt with satisfactorily  except by means  of Government legislation. 9.        Even  if the Second Reading of  the Bill were carried, the Bill would  have a difficult passage  in  Committee and it  seems very doubtful whether it would  succeed in reaching  the Statute Book.    It would  be better,  therefore,  to get the Bill defeated on  Second Reading, but this  is  likely to be difficult to secure, unless  the Government can announce an intention of  taking some legislative steps themselves in the early future. 10,       The one matter on which legislation may usefully be promised would be that of the bogus club.   A Bill on the lines of  the  existing Scottish law (and of the recommendations of the Royal Commission) giving the registration authority power to  refuse registration, or  the  renewal thereof,  on certain specified grounds (e.g. bad. character of applicants,  unsuitability of premises,misconduct of club)  would,  of course,  only touch a corner of  thewhole licensing question,  but would manifestly be  of public advantage.
     11.       So far as the question of &quot;permitted hours&quot; is concerned,     the complications arising from any attempt to amend the law are     so great that it would probably be better substantially to     preserve the present system, though certain amendments may be     desirable (e.g. the provision of a latest hour applying to     licensed premises and clubs alike).     12.       In these circumstances I would ask that the Home Office     Spokesman on the Second Reading should have authority to state     that it is intended next year to introduce a Rill to deal with     the problem of bogus clubs;  and that as to the other     recommendations of the Licensing Commission,  for example,  on     the question of permitted hours, which affect licensed premises     and clubs alike, it is the intention of the Government to     examine these recommendations and see whether acceptable     proposals could be put forward.   If this statement were made     the Home Office Spokesman might with some chance of success     discourage the House from proceeding further with the Bill.
