n. P. 60 (56).s B C RET.COPY NO.. 4^.CABINETIMPORT DUTIES ON GERMAN AND  AUSTRIAN GOODSMemorandum by the Chancellor      of the Exchequer.1.   The difference of opinion between the Board of Trade andthe Foreign Office on the proposed additional duties on felt -hats and leather raises an important question, the answer towhich may serve as a precedent for other cases in which asimilar divergence of&quot; view may arise.    I should like therefore to state the reasons which have impelled me to adopt theconclusion put forward by the Board of Trade.2.   Under the procedure of the Import Duties Act the ImportDuties Advisory Committee examine applications made to them for additional duties from the industrial  point cf view, taking intoaccount not only the interest of the particular industry concerned in the application but also  the possible effects on other industries, and weighing up the  balance of advantage to national industrial interests as a whole.3.   After they have made their recommendations the treasury have to decide whether to make them operative by order or not,and as they are hound by the Statute to publish the recommenda-tion they could not refuse to make the order without publishingalso their reasons for refusal.4.   The fact that this discretion is  given to  the  Treasuryindicates that there may be  reasons other  than  industrial  for not adopting the course which the  competent body has  declared
to be advisable if industry alone were to be considered.    Inthe [present case the Foreign Office urge that there are suchreasons and that they are urgent enough to override what  is thecustomary procedure;5.   I find myself in sympathy with the Foreign Secretary, whois pursuing a certain policy towards Germany and Austriarespectively and who sees that policy endangered by measures ofno great importance in themselves but yet calculated to give riseto charges of inconsistency and provocation.6.   On the other hand, I see even greater difficulties anddanger in rejecting the Import Duties Advisory Committee&apos;srecommendations, and explaining to the indignant applicants our reasons for doing sc.   Already there has been long delay sincethe applications were made, and some resentment is already beingmanifested on the subject.   But if the traders of this country were to be told that after their applications had passed all the tests applied to them by the Import Duties Advisory Committeethey might be rejected at the last minute  because we thoughtthat it might annoy their competitors to impose the duties forwhich they asked,or because we had political reasons for  desiringto show favour to a particular country, I am afraid that  an agitation against the foreign policy which produced such  resultsmight render it so unpopular as to destroy the Government&apos;ssupport for it just when it was most needed.7.   I consider therefore that in the present case we must risk the dangers that the Foreign Secretary foresees, which may perhaps turn out less serious than he anticipates.   On the otherhand, I think we should take warning from, the present case andtry to avoid a repetition of it.    The best hope of securing this result would be for the difficulties of the Foreign Office to bemade known to the  Import Duties Advisory Committee before  their                            -2-
recommendations are made,  and I understand that the Committeehave already mace arrangements by which Departments concerned will be given an opportunity to bring to their notice anyrelevant facts of which it is desirable that they should be aware before they make their report on any application to theTreasury.   It is believed that these arrangements will givethe Committee fuller opportunities for taking into account inany particular case all such considerations as are properlywithin their sphere?  but  it is of great importance that the                                                                 government should be able  to assure Parliament that no pressure  I                                                                 1from the Departments is being brought to bear upon the Committee ITreasury Chambers,  S.W.1.before they make their recommendations.(Intld.) N. G ,February 25th, 1936.
