THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 43  (36).CABINET.KENYA:  RESERVATION  OF  THE  HIGHLANDS QUESTION.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I AM  anxious that the question of the reservation of the Kenya Highlandsto Europeans should not occupy too much of the time available at the meeting ofthe Cabinet to the exclusion  of other Kenya problems, and  I have therefore thought it  desirable, before the Cabinet consider my  former memorandum, tomake some  reply to the memorandum which has been put in by the  Secretary ofState for India.    The reservation has been  a matter  of administrative  practice for nearly30 years.   The area concerned has always been vague and  the  Kenya land commission were instructed to advise as  to the definition of its boundaries.   in doing so they expressed themselves in terms which might be taken to imply thatthey considered that the Order-in-Council defining the boundaries should &apos; alsoexpressly assert the nature of the reservation.  Their report has been interpreted in this sense by the European settlers, who have built on it an elaborate structureindicating  the lines on which they propose that  the  reservation  should  be safeguarded.  The Indians have protested against any such interpretation of thereport.  In the White Paper of 1934, accepting the report of the Commission asa whole, His Majesty&apos;s Government said :         &quot;  9. The  Commission have defined the boundaries  of the  European    Highlands and His Majesty&apos;s Government  propose  to  accept  their recom-    mendations in regard to this.&quot;    My proposal is that the Order-in-Council should merely define the 1 jmdariesof the Highlands without any reference to the  reservation or the  &apos;privileged position &quot; of Europeans.  In this way we shall be taking away neither from the europeans  nor from the Indians anything which they have hitherto had.    As regards the Convention of 1919,  I do  not think that it can seriously bemaintained that the Indians have any rights against  Kenya  or His Majesty&apos;sGovernment as parties  to the  Convention.   The advantage which they gain fromthe Convention is the same as that which  the United Kingdom or Australia gain,namely, that of free access for their trade to the non-British parts of the Conven-tional Basin of the Congo.   The  Convention does not give one  part of theEmpire any rights against another part.     It is clear further  that the Indians cannot assert any moral claim under theConvention until some other  non-European  State, party to the Convention, hasclaimed a right of access to the Highlands.  Japan is specially in point.  It hasnot yet made such a claim and there is no present reason to suppose that it will do so, provided that we do not bring the matter into the forefront by giving a statutory status to the reservation of the Highlands.   In the circumstances i venture to  think that this question of the position of Indians is not  one whichwe need now consider.   If the case should arise, that is to say, if a claim underthe Convention were to be made by  Japan  and  if it were found that we couldnot resist it, the question of our attitude towards any  consequent demand from       [12727]
Indians, not on the ground of their position under the Convention, but on theground of equal treatment as between Asiatics, would have to be considered, but no charge of bad faith could then be brought against us in respect of any actionwhich we may take at the present time.     I hope that in the light of this explanation the Secretary of State for india will not feel that he is compelled to take the Government of India into confidenceover this matter.  I should, I am afraid, have  little hope that the information would not  percolate to Kenya,  and I do not wish the difficulty which  I  shall certainly have in reconciling European opinion there to a  mere definition of the highlands area to be exacerbated by wrongly  conceived  discussions as to the validity as against Indians of the reservation of the Highlands as an admini-strative practice.
