THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 66 (36).CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN  TREATY.        Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I  CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum on  the protection  of foreigners in Egypt after  the conclusion  of  an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.  Thememorandum suggests that the  objects of His Majesty&apos;s  Government in this-respect are more likely to be secured by means of an article in the Treaty in theterms of the relevant Article  (Article 3) of  the Draft Treaty of  1930 (see annex) than by an exchange of notes  on the lines recommended in paragraph 9&apos;of the memorandum by the Chairman of the  Committee of Imperial Defence;dated the 7th February, 1936 (CP. 25 (36)).   My colleagues will remember theCommittee&apos;s recommendation on this point was  adopted by the Cabinet and wasembodied in the instructions sent- to His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner for Egypton the 20th February (CP. 48 (36) ).   On reconsideration of the matter I feelthat,  for the reasons put forward in this memorandum,  Sir Miles Lampsohsinstructions on  this point should be revised, and I recommend that this be done as soon as possible.                                                                   A. E.    Foreign Office, February 29, 1936.    In paragraph 9 of the memorandum by the Chairman of the C.I.D., datedthe 7th February last (CP. 25 (36)), it is recommended that the question of theprotection of foreigners, instead of being dealt with by an article in the treaty on the lines of Article 3 of the draft treaty of 1930* (Article 6 of the 1933 draftbeing in the same terms),  should  form the subject of an  exchange  of notes,attached to the Treaty, and that the note should state (i) that the responsibilityfor the  maintenance of order remains with the Egyptian Government; and(ii) that in the event of armed support to the civil power being required from outside Egyptian resources, they should invite help by British forces and british forces only.  This recommendation, amongst others contained in the memorandum,Avas approved by the Cabinet on the 10th February, 1936 (see Cabinet conclusions (36) (g)).   The  grounds  for the recommendation were that  (1) so long as there8430  [12827]* See Annex.
were; British forces in  Egypt  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  could  not escaperesponsibility in the last resort for the safety of foreigners, and no treaty  couldabsolve His Majesty&apos;s Government from this responsibility;  yet the 1930  draftpurported to do so;  (2) an Egyptian Administration alone might well be unableto protect foreigners adequately, and there was a danger that a Power such asItaly might send forces to protect Italian  subjects in Italy  and  this should be prevented.     2.  On reconsideration of the matter, however, it is thought that it would bedesirable  to revise this decision on the ground that there is reason to believe thatan article in the terms of Article 3 of the 1930 draft would be better calculated to achieve the purposes on which  the recommendation is based than  the procedurerecommended.     3.  The effect of the relevant article in the 1930 Draft Treaty was (a) to saythat the Egyptian Government was exclusively responsible for the protection ofthe lives and property of foreigners,  but also (b) to create a contractual engage-ment on the part of the Egyptian  Government towards His Majesty&apos;s government by which  Egypt  undertook  to ensure the  adequate protection  of  foreigners.It resulted from this that any failure on the part of Egypt to protect foreignersof any nationality would be a  breach of a treaty obligation towards  the UnitedKingdom  and that Egypt admitted that the United Kingdom in reality retaineda special position in this respect, since Egypt had given no similar undertaking to any other country. It was no  doubt because the  Egyptian negotiators in 1930appreciated the  effect of (b) that  their acceptance of Article 3 was  only obtainedwith much difficulty.  This special position is doubtless what the recommendationof the C.I.D. was designed to  assure and what it was feared erroneously it issuggested had  been abandoned under the Draft Treaty of 1930.    4.  The  Egyptian Governments undertaking is important for the  purposenot merely of reassuring Parliament as regards the safety of British subjects,but also of reassuring foreign  Governments with regard to the security  of  their nationals.  It should also enable His Majesty&apos;s Government (i) to refuse totolerate any forceful  intervention on  the part of foreign Governments to protect their national interests, and (ii) to claim a special  right to intervene themselvesshould the Egyptian forces of law and order at any time break down.    5.  Under the procedure now recommended the proposed note, though con-taining (a), will have in place  of  (6) another provision  which  is  set  out  inparagraph 1  above, a provision which, it is considered, is  a  less adequate  safe-guard than (&amp;), and at the same time  much more difficult of negotiation with theEgyptian  Government.    6.  Further, the suggestion  that this  matter  should  be  dealt with in an exchange  of notes, as opposed  to an  article in the Treaty, was put forward onthe assumption that  it would be easier for the Egyptian Government to give anundertaking in this form, to the effect that if armed support for the civil Powerwere to be required from outside  Egyptian sources, it would only invite the help of the British forces.  But it is  not  stated in the  recommendation whether the note is  to be published  and  registered or not.   If, however, the  note is to  bepublished, there seems to be no  object in an exchange of notes as  against anarticle in  the Treaty; the effect  is the same and negotiation is not made anyeasier.  I  consider that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to induce-any Egyptian Government to admit  in a public document the possibility that itwould be unable to cope successfully with internal disorder, or to undertake in apublic agreement that it would seek help from His Majesty&apos;s Government alone.On the  other hand, an unpublished and unregistered note is an insufficient  safe-guard, because     (1) Being secret, foreign Governments have no knowledge of it,  and therefore           it cannot  be relied  on against  them as a ground for resisting  their           desires to protect their nationals by their own forces.    (2) Being unregistered it would be difficult under Article 18 of the Covenant           of the League to contend that it created any legal engagement binding           Egypt, and  for  this  reason and  because  of  the provisions of the           Egyptian Constitution, it would possess no more than moral force, and           that  probably  only against the actual Egyptian Prime Minister who           signed it  and members of the same Administration.&apos;&quot;&apos;
    7.  Moreover, an-article in the Treaty in the terms of Article 3 of the draft treaty of 1930 would have the advantage that the Egyptian Government; havingonce agreed to it, would find it difficult now to reject it.  This would mot holdgood in the case of a new. demand put forward in a new form by His Majesty&apos;s;Government:                        .-  . . --.         ;           i  .    ,    8.  For these reasons it is considered that  the decision of His  Majesty&apos;s!Government approving the recommendation made in paragraph  9 of the memo-randum by the Chairman of the C.I.D. above referred  to  should be modifiedaccordingly.    Foreign Office, February 29, 1936.ANNEX.                   Anglo-Egyptian Draft Treaty  of 1930.                                ARTICLE 3.    His  Britannic Majesty recognises that the responsibility for the lives and property of foreigners in Egypt devolves exclusively upon the Egyptian Govern-ment, who  will ensure the fulfilment of their obligations in this respect.
