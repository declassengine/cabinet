THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the  Cabinet.  February  1936.CONFIDENTIAL.                                                Copy No.  4CP.  39 (36).CABINET.GERMAN MINISTERS&apos;  SPEECHES.                        MAY 1934 TO JANUARY 1936.           Memorandum, by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I CIRCULATE herewith for the information of my colleagues, a documentprepared  in  the Foreign  Office,  which  contains  a series  of  extracts  from german Ministers&apos; speeches on the aims of German foreign policy.  The speecheswere made between May 1934-a date very nearly coincident with  the final break-down of the disarmament discussions and the end of January 1936.    It will  be  noted that,  speaking in  Berlin on the  17th  January lastTDr. Goebbels  remarked that the time would come when &apos;&apos; Germany will be obligedto  demand   colonies  from  the  world &apos;&apos;;  and  speaking  in  Munich  on the26th January Herr Hitler reminded his audience that colonies were acquired bythe right of taking them.  These statements by no means constitute the  first publicdeclarations by German Ministers on this subject.  As long ago as September 1934Herr Hess expressed the hope that other nations who had a superfluity of colonial territory would give Germany some; and in March 1935, in a speech at Leipzig,Dr. Schacht mentioned the importance of the return  of colonies to Germany.  InAugust 1935  Dr.  Frick,  the Minister for  the  Interior,   spoke  of  the&quot; Lebensraum &quot;  required for the German people.  But  these statements, whichhave become  more  frequent since Germany announced  her rearmament  inMarch 1935,  are curious when compared with the speeches of German Ministersless than two years ago.   In May 1934, for instance, Herr Hitler  said that  &quot; theGerman people had only one wish : to live in peace and  happiness after its ownfashion,&quot;  to  which  Baron von  Neurath added, in September 1934,  that  &quot; theGerman aims in foreign policy are  strictly limited.  Germany only  desires equalrights in armaments and a fair settlement of the Saar question.&quot;  In those  days,even according to General Goring (December 1934),  &quot; a sharp sword &quot; was onlyrequired in order that Germany might &apos;&apos; know peace and quiet&apos;&apos;; and even inJanuary 1935, according to Dr.  Goebbels, the  peace which came  with the SaarPlebiscite  was &quot; a peace which men of honour could, in fact, accept  with  their whole hearts.&apos;&apos;    After the decree  of March 1935 reintroducing Conscription  the Germanleaders began to speak  somewhat  differently.  According  to Herr Hitler inMay 1935, it was &quot; necessary to give play to the law of continuous development by allowing for the possibility of the revision of treaties.  A regulated developmentof treaties is  an element for securing peace, but the suppression of any necessary changes is only too liable to result in an explosion in the future.&quot;  As early asFebruary 1935 Dr. Goebbels, in remarking upon the increase in the strength ofthe German  nation, observed that &quot;nothing  is given  to nations, but  nationsmust take what  they need for their existence.&quot;   Immediately after the MarchDecree General von Blomberg, in drawing attention to the importance of german rearmament, remarked on &apos;&apos; the possibility of a reorganisation of Europe and theworld by peaceful means, provided that this reorganisation takes into account thenatural vital principles of the nations.&quot;   In December 1935 General  Goring      8340   [12690]                                                B
spoke even more  openly :  &quot; We have not rearmed in  order to have parades orto indulge in militaristic feelings, but in order to serve world  peace and our peace.   Germany must recover her place in the sun. .  .  .  There are sometimesdeaf partners (in the work of international understanding).   The attention ofthese can, when all other means have failed, only be  aroused by the powerfulvoice of guns.  We have, through our  rearmament, taken steps  to see that weshall  be property heard in regard to  international agreement.&quot;  Last  monthDr. Goebbels enlarged on the same theme; and, after stating that &quot; it is dangerousfor the world not to concede &apos;&apos;  (demands like those of Italy) &apos;&apos; because some day the bomb will explode,&quot; added that &quot; there are moments when one has to take thesword and cut the knot.&quot;  We heard in a recent  despatch from our consul atLeipzig  that  somewhat  similar  language was used there  by Dr.  Schacht inDecember last.  He is said to have remarked that it had  taken the foundersof the  second  Reich from 1870  until  1914 to reach  a position of  militarypreponderance in Europe.  What their predecessors had accomplished in forty-fouryears they would have  to achieve in  the short  space of four years.  In this connexion we should note also Dr.  Goebbels&apos;s statement of the 17th January lastthat he prefers &quot; to rely on guns &quot; rather than &quot;on a world conscience,  whichis the League of  Nations, whose part it is to preserve  the peace of the world.&quot;We heard the same sort of thing from Herr Hitler himself only last September :&quot; It was not a pleasant feeling, as Germany had cause to know, to be compelledto wander  through  the  dragons&apos;  den  in which apostles   of  internationalreconciliation were laying the seeds of further discord, and alliances in the causeof peace were studying the possibilities and methods of the next war.....Germany realised what happened to a country which relied on  expressions of sympathy and goodwill.&quot;   Better  than  &quot;treaties, pacts, agreements on spheres of interest &quot; was  the determined will of the  Government  and the actual strengthof the nation.  Worth noting also  is Dr. Goebbels&apos;s remark of the 17th Januarythat &quot; if a treaty had once become intolerable, there were higher laws than thosewhich were written in ink.&quot;    At a time when I have just re-circulated to the Cabinet a series of despatchescontaining the views of our Ambassador in Berlin on German intentions, it willperhaps be useful to give also to  the Cabinet this note  on  the development ofGerman Ministers&apos; speeches.  These scarcely leave us room to doubt that the rearmament of Germany  is not  being carried  out for  nothing Or without  a purpose. We can hardly avoid the conclusion that it is being carried out because,in the words  of  General Goring,  &quot; there are sometimes extraordinarily deafpartners &quot; in the diplomatic Council Chamber who can only  &quot; be aroused by the powerful voice of guns.&quot;   As Herr Hitler himself has warned us, it  is not inthese  circumstances likely to be  pleasant  to  continue  &quot; to wander  unarmedthrough such a dragons&apos; den.&quot;                                                                   A.

EXTRACTS FROM SPEECHES  OF  AND  PRESS INTERVIEWS WITH    GERMAN MINISTERS  ON THE AIMS OF GERMAN FOREIGN                 POLICY,  MAY 1934 to JANUARY 1936.Hitler, May 1, 1934.    &quot;The  German people had only one wish, to  live in peace and happinessthrough industry after its own fashion.  The German people knew no revengeand desired no conquest.  It wished to reach out  to  every nation the hand of reconciliation and understanding; but it would continue in unswerving determina-tion to defend its own right to live and would never renounce its claim to be a nation of equal rights, just as it would always be ready to make the same  sacrificesfor the maintenance of peace and prosperity as other nations.&quot;Hitler, June 18, 1934, at Gera.    &quot;We wish abroad only to ensure that we are left in peace  ....   We have at home  a  great goal before us;  we have a gigantic work of  reform  to  carryout ....  Just as little as we have the intention to commit an injustice towardsanyone in the world, so little do we allow ourselves to be overcome by force  ....We are determined that no one shall make our right to  self-defence  a matter for dispute ....  We only wish to be so strong that others will not try toattack us ... .  So little as Germany desires war, even so fanatically shall weact for German freedom and the honour of our people .... The time of dictatesis past  ....   We  shall  protect  ourselves  against  any  attempt  to  place theGerman people in the future under a lasting yoke.&quot;Goebbels, June 25, 1934, at Essen.    &apos;&apos; It was the duty of  the  Air Sport Federation to  keep  alive the  spirit ofthe war pilots,  so that the sacrifices of the Great War should not have been invain.  In no treaty was it written that the spirit of the old  German army andthe air troops must be surrendered or extinguished.&quot;Hess  (Deputy  to the Chancellor  and Deputy Leader  of  the  Nazi  Party),    July 9, 1934, in East Prussia.    &apos;&apos; It is high time that a real understanding between  the peoples  should bereached an understanding  based on  mutual respect ....   The road  for awalking tour through our country is not open .... The ex-soldiers want peace.The  nation wants peace.  The German Government wants peace.  We do not abandon hope that in spite of all the French Government desires peace.&quot;Hitler, &quot; Daily Mail &quot; interview, August 6, 1934.    &quot;If it rests with Germany, war will not  come again. It is the conviction of the Nazi movement that war can benefit no one.  We ask only that our presentfrontiers shall  be intact.  We shall never attack again except in self-defence.Once  the Saar question is settled, no further territorial difference will exist between us and France, while on our eastern frontier I have proved our peacefulintentions by making a pact with Poland.  Unless  England attacks us, we shall never come into conflict with England on the Rhine or anywhere else.  We wantnothing from England.  I would  not sacrifice the life of a single German toget any colony  in the world.  Such steps  as we are taking (in armaments) aremeant to deal with the fact that we are surrounded on the continent by a ringof powerful potential foes,  who may some day make demands on us that  wecannot accept.  It is not the  extent of armaments that produces  war, but theinequality  of  armaments.   The  Nazi  movement  would  regard war  between germany and England as a  racial crime.&quot;Hitler, August 28,  1934, at  Coblenz.    &quot;The  Saar problem was the last remaining object of territorial controversy between Germany and France, and it was to  be hoped that the solution of this problem  would result in increased readiness on the part of France to  conclude      [12690]                                                    B 2
 a genuine peace with Germany.  When, on  the  14th  January, the bells were pealing throughout Germany, they must ring in not only the return of Germany&apos;s lost territory, but also the beginning of an era of peace.&quot; Yon Neurath, September 13, 1934, at  Stuttgart.     &quot;The maintenance and furtherance of the German people in the way that National  Socialism desires has  nothing to  do with imperialism.   It  is  rather perfectly  reconcilable with the rights and interests of other people.   The German people wishes nothing more than to live in peace with  foreign States and to maintain  peaceful,  friendly and neighbourly relations with foreign peoples.&quot; Hess, &apos;&apos; Intransigeant &apos;&apos;  interview, September 9, 1934.     &quot;Hitler requires peace and tranquillity for his nation.  An understanding with France is perfectly practicable Avith goodwill on both sides.   Undoubtedly the French people wishes this understanding, but it is desirable that the French Government should announce that they also desire it.&quot; Hitler, &quot;  Intransigeant &quot; interview,  September 21, 1934.     &quot; The German nation  has a weakness  for  France  and appreciates  the gallantry  of  her attitude.   I  have  always  clone  my best  to clear up  the atmosphere  between  France and Germany,  and to  settle  notably the Saar question.&quot; Yon Neurath, September 19, 1934, at  Berlin.     The  German aims in foreign policy are strictly limited.  Germany only desires equal rights in armaments, and a fair settlement of the Saar question in accordance with the treaties.   &quot; As regards our foreign policy, we have a right to demand that an end should be made of the misrepresentations and suspicions which still constantly make their appearance, and  that the fact should be taken into account that the National Socialist Government is a partner which combines a determination to  protect the indispensable and  vital interests and values of the German people with an equally firm determination to be a stable factor in the peace of Europe.&quot; Goring, &quot; Daily  Mail  &quot; interview, October 18, 1934.     &quot; We Germans know that Britain will never attack us.  If we have appre- apprehensions of  being attacked, they are in another quarter.   Those apprehensions are the reason why I am  aiming  at a defensive air  force for Germany.....   I assure you that  Germany is not  the trouble-maker in Europe.   I am convinced, on the contrary,  that gradually the German and British  nations will draw closer together by reason of those ties of blood which unite us.&quot; Hitler, &quot; Matin &quot; interview, November 18, 1934.     &quot; The Germany of to-day does not think like the Germany of the past.  We are not thinking of  square kilometres of territory to conquer.  We are thinking of ensuring life for  our people. ....   It is apt to be said that I am trying only to gain time to finish my preparations.   To that I  answer that my  plan of work is such that the man  who can reach the end which I am pursuing will deserve from a grateful people a much  grander monument than would be 1&apos;raised to  a glorious chief after numerous victories.&quot; Goring  (Essen),  December S, 1934.    The   Germany  of to-day  was a  wholly different  Germany from  that  of yesterday. Formerly  Germany had been a cypher as far as international policy was concerned.  To-day  no international policy was  possible unless it  reckoned with Germany.  The world knew that to-day a &apos;&apos; walk to Berlin &apos;&apos; was no longer possible.   Germany, to-day was a real force;  and what had enabled her to become this force was not the might of cannons, but that inner moral strength  which in the long, run must  triumph over everything on earth.  Only  a  nation without weapons and without honour could also be without peace.   The English statesman who said  some days ago that only a disarmed nation  was a menace  to  peace
51 should have remembered that what was true for England was true for Germany too.  Only a Germany of  honour was  a guarantee of world peace.  Only  a Germany of freedom could maintain this peace and would know how to preserve it.   For this reason Germany  demanded for herself the same  rights as  were enjoyed by others.   For  this reason  she knew that other nations  too would recognise the time for that  real understanding which could only be  arrived at between equal partners of equal strength, but never between two parties, one of which was strong and the other weak.  The ex-service men of all countries could, as had repeatedly been shown, always understand each other,  because they had learned to respect each other.  Some days ago he himself had had the opportunity of speaking with the venerable Field-Marshal Petain, a soldier, and therefore a gentleman who could understand the Germans.  With men such as these,  under- standing was possible.  Germany desired no war, but she did desire her honour, and this point she would  not discuss with anyone in the world; her honour was the basis for the reconstruction  of the entire nation.  Only he who had a sharp sword at his side could know peace and quiet.  This was no provocation to  war; on the contrary, to be disarmed was to invite attack. Hitler  (broadcast), January IS, 1935.     &quot; Your decision,  German comrades from  the  Saar,  gives  me  to-day the possibility of  making, as our generous historical contribution to the pacification of Europe,  which is so necessary, the  declaration that, after the completion of your return, the German Reich will make no further territorial claims on France. I believe that we thus express to the Powers our recognition for the loyal arrange- ment of this plebiscite effected in combination with France and  with ourselves, and for the arrangements made  for giving effect subsequently to  the voting.  It is the wish of us all that  this German termination of such a tragic wrong  may contribute to the further  pacification of the European peoples.  For  great and unlimited as is our determination to obtain and secure for Germany equality of rights,  no less great is our desire not  to hold back  from those tasks which are necessary for the establishment of a true solidarity of the nations in the face of the dangers and needs of  to-day.&quot;Goebbels  (after Saar plebiscite), January 15, 1935.    The world had at last heard  the sound  of Germany&apos;s blows upon the  doorof equality of rights, and  her demands could not long be  refused.  Now that the last territorial question between France  and Germany had been settled,  it was possible to let the voice of peace  ring out loud and effectively in Europe, a peace based on the honour of all, which really reconciled the nations and did not againhear within it the seeds of a new war, a peace which men of  honour could, in fact,  accept with  their  whole  hearts.   Once  again we  declare  loudly  anddistinctly before  all the world :  &apos;&apos; This  people wishes to  solve its problems athome, and for that it needs a peace of honour.&quot;  Germany would win a  victory of peace in Europe.  The longer this took, the longer it would last.   The National Socialist formations were being educated  not for war  but for peace.Hitler (press interview), January 17, 1935.    After the return of  the Saar territory,  Germany  would  have no further territorial claims to make on France. This was a renunciation of great historical importance.  He had made  it in  order  to contribute, by  means of this  heavysacrifice, to the pacification of Europe.  More could not be asked of Germany. Itwas now for the rest of the world to draw the consequences from such a decision. At the  same time neither  he nor the Reich would ever agree to any diminution of the rights  of  the  German people.  They wished  to be peaceful,  but  in no circumstances  without honour.   They were ready to  make  a great sacrifice, butnever to renounce their claim to  freedom.   They rejected any  differentiation between moral and actual equality of rights; there  was  only one equality of rights and that  was the right of  a sovereign State  and  of a sovereign nation.If the world would recognise  this, there would be no need of any elaborate plans for the  stabilisation of European peace.
Hitler (Ward Price interview), January 17, 1935.     &quot; Neither I nor anyone else in Germany thinks of imposing &apos; conditions &apos; forthe eventual re-entry of Germany into the League.  Whether or not we returnto this  institution  depends exclusively on the question whether  we can belong to it as a completely equal nation.....   This is no &apos; condition,&apos; but merelycommon sense.   Either  we are a sovereign State or we are not.....So longas the National Socialist movement leads Germany,  and this will  be the case forthe next few hundred years .... this attitude will remain unaltered.     &quot;No possible  profits  will  justify the  sacrifices and sufferings that warentails. .....  I therefore make the two following statements:  (1) Germany on her side will never break the peace; (2) whoever attacks us will fall on a hornefsnest,  for we  love freedom as much as we love peace.  While, on the one hand, Igive France  an assurance  in the name of the whole  of the German people thatwe will make no more  territorial claims against her, and thereby  abandon theidea of  revenge, on  the other hand, I give as firm an assurance that no hardships,no  pressure  and no force  will ever bring us to renounce our  honour and  ourequality of rights.&quot;Hitler (press interview &quot; Gazeta Polska &quot;), January 28, 1935.     &quot; National Socialist policy is based on National Socialist philosophy.  Theracial theory of the National Socialist  philosophy rejects, on principle,  allso-called  &apos; denationalisation.&apos;    On  the   contrary,  it  regards  the  forcibleannexation  of  foreign  peoples and  property as a weakening  rather than  a strengthening of the people and property of the annexing party.  The policy adopted by us of respecting the foreign peoples living on our frontiers thereforecorresponds,  in the highest degree, with the philosophy of our movement, and,therefore, with our deepest convictions.   We  do  not for a moment  think of continuing the mistakes made in this  respect in the course of former centuries.One expression of this  determination  is the attempt to  put on  a new basis  therelations of the German people with Poland.  Practical experience throughoutthe last century has, moreover, shown that the really valuable elements in a countrycannot be denationalised, or only with great difficulty and very  slowly.   Thesuccess achieved is  almost entirely confined to the vacillating and therefore  forthe most part  inferior elements in the country.  The  conquest  of even theseelements cannot, however, in any case be regarded as yielding a profit in any wayproportional  to the suffering and danger connected with it.  For this reason  I regard a mutual protection of nationalities as one of the most deserving aims ofa powerful Government.  It is, however,  clear  that such  a policy  can only be;successfully put into practice if mutual understanding exists.&quot;     &quot; You will understand that at the present time little can be said publicly onthe subject of the various pact proposals, since their discussion has to some extentonly recently begun.  I can only continue to repeat:      &quot; (1) Germany desires to live in peace with all her neighbours, and she is           ready to make with magnanimity all concessions necessary thereto.     &apos;&apos; (2) Germany will never more renounce her equality of rights.     &quot; (3) By international co-operation we cannot understand the assumption of           obscure obligations with  consequences which might, in  the long run           without taking into account Germany&apos;s  national interests, lead us to-           the point at which we do not wish to  arrive of our own  free will,.           namely, war.&quot;Hitler, February 14, 1935, Munich.     &apos;&apos; We have at last  before us a glorious goal for the present time, the freedomof our people.  We ourselves must win it. ....  Before us is growing up  theiron guarantee  of  German equality of lights  and the guarantee of Germanself-determination in this world.....  We are only at the beginning of new developments.   What we have done  in  two years is but a promise of what  weshall do.  We will know only one &apos; yes &apos; and one &apos; no &apos;; for peace always &apos; yes,&apos;for the  denial of Germany&apos;s honour  always &apos; no.&apos; .... We are determined to stand absolutely  upon  our own feet if the world demands anything  unworthyfrom us.&quot;
 Goebbels, February 24, 1935.     &quot; If to-day Germany is once again being treated as a sovereign nation, do not imagine that this is because the world is prepared to accept us.  No.  This is due to us, to our hardiness, to our decision and, I say it openly, it is due to our newly awakening strength alone.  Nothing is given to peoples, but peoples must take what they need  for their  existence.&quot; Hess, March 1, 1935, saarbrucken.     &quot; The  Treaty of Versailles had been based on  wrong principles, not only as regards the Saar, but as regards other things as well.   As the world could learn the truth about the Saar,  so it Avould in time learn the truth  about the  rest of the treaty.&quot; Hitler, March 1, 1935, saarbrucken.     &quot; We hope that  by means of this act of equality  and justice the  relations between Germany and France will at last improve.   Just as we desire peace, we must also hope that our great  neighbour, too, is willing and ready to  seek this peace with  us.  It must be possible that two great  nations  shall give each other their hands in order to  face  together in  co-operation the  difficulties  which overwhelm  Europe.....  Let the Saar  continue  to  put their loyalty  at  the service of the new Reich.  Let  them lend it the support of an iron will, without which nothing can be achieved;  then,  in fifteen or twenty years&apos; time, when Germany will be wholly free, they will be proud and happy in the knowledge of the part they have played.&quot; Goring (unpublished interview  with Ward Price),  March 12,  1935.     Goring used very strong language about France. If they dare to go to war with Germany the accursed French will be  wiped,  out, and it  would be a bad thing,  too,  for any other country that meddled in the quarrel;  Poland would  be a useful ally, but she would have to cede the corridor. Hitler,  conscription  proclamation, March  16,  1935.     &quot; What the German Government, as  protector of the honour and the interestsof the German nation, desire is to ensure that degree of armed force  which is necessary not only for the maintenance  of the integrity of the German  Reich,but also for the international respect and esteem of Germany as a co-guarantor of the general peace.     &quot;For in this hour the German Government renew before the German  people and before  the whole world  the assurance of their determination never to go beyond  the protection of German honour and the freedom  of the Reich, and,  in particular, of their desire not  to  create  in the German national armaments an instrument  of  warlike  aggression, but  rather one exclusively  of  defence  and thereby of the maintenance of peace.     &apos;&apos; The German Government express the confident hope that it may be granted to the  German people, now recovering their  honour in  independent equality  of rights,  to make their contribution to the pacification of the world in free  and open co-operation with the other nations and their Governments.&quot; Yon Blomberg (War  Minister), Berlin, March 17, 1935.      The German nation must recognise  the ideal of a strong and proud Germanycapable of self-defence, which would never again capitulate and never again  set its  signature to treaties and agreements  which affected  its honour, security and right to live.  At the same time, however, Germany must see in  the World War a catastrophe the repetition of which must be spared the present and the coming generation.   Europe had become too small  to be made a battlefield for the nextwar.  Germany needed no  revenge, because in the four years of the Great Warshe had won fame enough for centuries  to come.  We believe in the possibility ofa reorganisation of Europe and the world by peaceful means, provided that thisreorganisation  takes  into account the  &quot;Htural vital principles  of nations and
                                     bdoes not, as a result of rigid insistence on out-of-date measures of compulsion,.lead to injustice.  We  desire the diminution and  reconciliation of intolerabletensions in a peace which offers every country equal rights and equal security.&quot;Goebbels, March 31,  1935.     &apos;&apos; Germany does not even  think of war.  On the contrary, we regard theperpetual talk of war as a crime.....We are  convinced that a little less talkand a little more sense would be of great service to the world.&quot;Hess, at Freimann, April 2, 1935.     &quot;Since the 16th March we are free once again and the world knows thatour freedom can never  again be  threatened without our passionate reaction inour own defence.   We have forged our sword .... simply and solely in order tomaintain our  country in peace and to avoid in future the horrors  which wewent through  He who would  strike Germany must know that the sword willstrike him.&quot;Goring, April 30, 1935.     &quot; To-day, beside the German hammer and anvil, lies once more the Germansword,  and above all stands peace, for only he cannot know peace who is defence-less among the other nations.     &quot; The Leader had  once again restored  to Germany unity and peace.   Hewould also be strong enough to maintain peace abroad.  Germany had declared to*the other nations that her hand was stretched out to them.    &apos;&apos; We have not forged our sword to lead our nation once again into a bloodymadness, but simply and solely in order to maintain our country in peace, and toavoid for ever in future the horrors which we went through.  But he who wouldtouch Germany must know that the sword will  strike him.  The German peopleknows that it must not only devote its life to the reconstruction of the Fatherlandand of the nation, but that it is its duty to co-operate with the other peoples andto work with them for the general progress of humanity.  We cannot allow otherpeoples to set themselves up  as judges of  Germany who never could or should bejudges.  Germany is judged by its Leader. Germany desires peace and is servingit more than those who are always  forming new blocs in order to hurl once more into the abyss the most peace-loving country in the heart of Europe.&quot;Goring, May 2, 1935, to the Foreign Press.    The way in which the German air force had  been created was original andunique. He had rejected the method of slow and  gradual rearmament.  He had developed to the utmost  the technical and industrial possibilities, which latermade  it possible for the air  force to be created at a single stroke. ...  &quot;I amtelling you nothing surprising when I emphasise that the German air force is so strong that the Power which attacked Germany would have a very, very difficultproposition  in the air.  For  the German  air force does not contain a single oldaeroplane!  It does not possess a single old engine!  The engines and machinespossessed by the German air force to-day are  the most  modern that there  areanywhere in the world. ...    &quot; Germany needs peace, and she  will neither disturb the peace of her own accord nor allow herself to be provoked into doing so, because she will not plungeinto any adventure and because the inviolability  of her honour as her ultimateand  highest value will  always be her  guiding  line. .  .  .&quot;   Germany wouldthreaten no other nation, but she also could not allow others to threaten germany or to interfere in matters which were Germany&apos;s  concern alone.  &quot; German historywill be made  by  Germans,  and Germany will  show the world that the entirecountry stands behind the Leader&apos;s  statement : &apos;  Germany desires and needs peace,,and willingly  co-operates to maintain it.&apos; &quot;
Goring, Freiburg, May 10, 1935.     &quot; What was the opinion held before about your State?   &apos; Frontier State &apos; itwas called, which in the case of  emergency must naturally be given up at once.That was once upon a time.   To-day we declare that in Germany we no longerrecognise any  frontier  States. The Leader has declared that we maintain peace.But if they do not grant us peace, if Germany is  attacked,  then our resistancebegins 1 centimetre behind the German frontier.  I repeat what I have already declared to the foreign press : we have taken the most important step for peace;we have rearmed.  Nothing threatens peace more than for a great people to seek to live powerless in the midst of highly armed States.  We desire no  war, but if one is forced upon us we cannot stop it.  Whether one or ten nations attack us, weshall do our duty.  We cannot do  more.  Germany faced the whole world for fouryears and the  world did not defeat her. Why do they to-day make pacts 1  Whyare they madly arming ?   It  is still fear of Germany.  I do not know if foreign nations understand what a gigantic  testimonial they are giving to  Germany&apos;sheroic struggle in the war.&apos;&apos;Hitler, in  Reichstag, May 21, 1935.     Details of this speech, which has been published in eootenso in England, arenot included in this collection.Frick (Minister for Interior), Essen, August  5, 1935.     &quot; We Germans, as a people which has for some time no longer possessedsufficient &apos; Lebensraum,&apos;  have much understanding for the similar situation ofItaly.  But at the same time we declare with all plainness that the German Reich,which is  extraordinarily over-populated,  and  suffers greatly from this over-population,  has a  greater right to colonial possessions.  Other countries behaveas if they laid especial weight on Germany&apos;s return to the League  of Nations;then, first of  all, the &apos; colonial guilt lie &apos;  must be abolished, which was used at versailles as a pretext for robbing the Reich of its old and  flourishing colonial possessions.  We too need &apos; Lebensraum &apos; for our people, and we shall not allowour vital necessities to be merely passed over before  proceeding to other agenda.-&apos;Hitler, August 11, 1935.     &quot; Nobody can doubt that in the last two and a  half years Germany enjoys adifferent  place in  the world  from formerly.  There is no social  happiness in aState the members of which are subject to a foreign  will.  I am convinced that noone in the world can any longer attack our Reich.  We want peace, we want toreconstruct.  Everywhere in our country there is  work,  work and  more  work.Just as we desire peace,  so the other countries should desire  peace too.  He whowould disturb our peace will no longer meet a nation of pacifists,  but  a nation ofmen. The mere fact that this is so is a greater contribution to  peace than any amount of speeches.&quot;Hitler, September 11, 1935.     Great as had been  the work of the Government in this sphere, the restorationof the nation&apos;s freedom and  honour had been  an achievement which put all elsein the shade.  Without this everything else would have been in vain, particularly at a time of unparalleled international  disquiet, when  the  so-called rule of ahigher law was further off than ever before. Woe to the country that  was weak !&quot; Its wealth ultimately even  provides the strong with the moral justification forthe right to subject it.  By  freeing slaves, slaves are made; and by abolishingclasses, classes are born.&apos;&apos;  The Marxist theorists who cried  &apos;&apos; No more war !&apos;&apos;and the apostles of international  reconciliation were laying the seeds of further-discord, and the alliances in the cause of peace were studying the possibilities and methods of the next war.  It was not a  pleasant feeling, as Germany had hadcause to know, to be compelled to wander unarmed through such a dragon&apos;s den.Germany had realised what happened to a country which relied on expressions of sympathy  and goodwill.  Where were Wilson&apos;s  fourteen points, and  where wasthe world  to-day?  Now, however, Germany could look about her  with calm and confidence, for she was no longer  a defenceless plaything for the  satisfaction  offoreign ambitions, but was assured of safety.  Assured, too, not by freaties, pacts.      [12690]                                                      c
agreement as to spheres of interests and conventions, but by the determined will of the government and by the actual strength of the nation.   It was not necessaryfor Germany to prove her safety to the rest of the world by demonstrations ofany kind.  It was enough that she herself was convinced of  it.  She could enjoythis sense of security all the more  since the German people  and its Governmenthad no other intention than to live in peace and friendship with their neighbours.The Jewish bolshevistic agitators might work their  hardest  to plunge the worldinto chaos; National  Socialist Germany would  appreciate all  the  more  herrestored defence forces.  The army was the shield of Germany&apos;s peaceful work,and was worth the heavy  sacrifices which it entailed.   It was the army of theNational Socialist State, and Germany&apos;s proudest  and most valued  possession.Hitler, Nuremberg, September IS,  1935.     &quot; The German people can feel itself happy in the consciousness of thisregained  strength, after  a  time  of  such frightful suffering  and  prolongeduncon consciousness.    &quot; Especially so at a time which appears to be  exposed to grave crisis.    &quot; germany is once  more healthy.   Its  institutions  are  internally andexternally in order.    &quot; Ail the more great is the responsibility of the leadership of the Reich insuch serious times. There can be only one guiding principle for all our actions;our great and unshakable love of peace.    &quot; Such a declaration seems to me to be necessary at the present time when acertain section  of the international press is unfortunately continually striving todraw Germany into the sphere of its intrigues.    &quot;  One moment they  treat the case of German action  against France,  atanother the supposition that she will turn against Austria, and then the fear thatshe will attack Russia where, I  do not know.  These threats are then mostlyserved up as arguments  for  the necessity of the desired coalitions, which vary according to the needs of the moment.    &quot;No less  magnanimously, however,  does this press  distribute  Germanfriendship, or,  alternatively, treat  it as an object which is  immediately at thedisposal of every statesman who feels a need even to reach out his hand for it.    &apos;&apos;  I scarcely need to assure you, Deputies and men of the Reichstag,  that theGerman Government  does not make its decisions as a result of  any  attitudetowards anyone in particular, but solely  as a result of its feeling of responsibilitytowards Germany.    &quot;  It is not, however, the object of our work to  waste its results in a frivolousand therefore insane adventure.    &quot;  The object of the reconstruction of the German army was not to threaten  orremove the freedom of any European people, but solely to preserve the freedom  ofthe German people.    &quot;  This  state of mind decides  in the  first place the foreign policy of theGerman Government.    &quot;  For this  reason we take up no attitude towards events which, do not concernGermany, and we do not wish to be drawn into such events.    &quot; With all  the greater concern,  however, must, for this very reason, the Germanpeople follow the course of events in Lithuania.  At a period of the most profoundpeace Memelland was stolen from Germany, years after the conclusion of peace.This robbery was legalised by the League of Nations,  and only connected with themaintenance of an autonomy which was to be accorded to the Germans in Memeland laid down  in a treaty.  For years now the  German element of this territoryhas been mishandled and tortured, in contravention of the laws and the treaties.A great nation must  perpetually  look on, while, contrary  to law and treaty provisions, people of its own blood,  who  had been attacked at a  time of profoundpeace and torn from the Reich, are treated worse  than  criminals are treated  in normal States.  Their sole crime,  however, is that they are Germans and wish  toremain so.  Representations by the responsible Powers at Kovno have  remained,hitherto at least, mere outward formalities without  any value or  any internalresult.    &quot;  The Government of the German Reich  regards  this development withattention and with bitterness.  It  would be a  laudable task for the League ofNations to turn its interest to the  Lespecting of the  autonomy of  the Memel Terri-
tory, and see that it becomes practically effective before here, too, events take  a form which one day could only be regretted by all sides.  (Applause and cries of&apos; Bravo!&apos;)   The  preparations which are at present  going on there  for  theelections constitute a mockery of all law and legal obligations.    &quot; Germany makes  no unjustified claims of any kind in demanding  thatLithuania should be kept by effective means to  the maintenance of  the treatieswhich she has signed.  In the end, however, a nation  of 65 million has the rightto demand that it be treated with no less respect than the arbitrary rule of a peopleof 2 million.  (Applause and cries of &apos; Bravo !&apos;)    &apos;&apos; Unfortunately, it is at present our experience that, while international under-standing is more necessary than ever, the Bolshevist International is systematicallyand openly once more planning from Moscow a world  revolution, that  is to say,  astirring up of international strife.  The  spectacle of  the Comintern Congress at moscow  is  an effective  underlining of the sincerity  of  the &apos; policy of non-interference &apos; demanded by that same Power.    &quot;As we, having learnt from our own experience, and,  as we  are  able to  see,from the experience of  other States,  do  not  expect anything  from protests andrepresentations at Moscow, we are decided  to oppose the Bolshevik revolutionaryagitation in Germany with the effective weapon  of National Socialist enlighten-ment.  The party congress should have left no doubt that national socialism, in sofar as the bolshevism of Moscow attempts to get a footing in Germany or driveGermany  into  revolution,  will put  a stop in the  most thorough  way to this intention and to such attempts.&quot;Hess, Nuremberg, September 11, 1935.    Between the present  congress and the last lay the 16th March, the day onwhich the Leader, by announcing the restoration  of compulsory military service,had  restored to  Germany her freedom.  Under his  leadership  Germany had abandoned a treaty which had been extorted from her and broken by the other side, and had, through her own strength, assumed the  right the most primitiveright of every free  people to create the army  and  the  weapons which were-necessaiy  for assuring  her freedom  and independence.  Once again hundreds of thousands were passing through the great military school of the nation, andwere  learning  how to handle the  most  modern  weapons  which  the  ingenuityand industry of the German people could produce, so as to make national defencepossible.  Germany had recovered  her honour; with  equal rights and entitledto equal respect she now ranked among the other free  nations of the world.  Ofher own accord, and while preserving her own interests, she once again concludedsovereign treaties with foreign Powers. At her own suggestion she had conductednegotiations with the greatest sea Power in the world, which had made possibleonce more the construction of an effective means of national defence at sea; also at her own suggestion and with wise moderation she had set limits to this force.Instead of being a territory exploited by the  rest of the world  Germany was-once again a factory whose friendship the Great Powers were anxious to assure.The fighting forces created by Adolf Hitler now marched in natural comradeshipbeside the bearers of the  political and intellectual  weapons of the country, themen  of the N.S.D.A.P.   Germany had  forged,  in her new  national army, a weapon of defence against the brute  force of world bolshevism.Hitler, October 6, 1935.    &apos;&apos; Let us turn our eyes towards the rest of the world; unrest and insecurityrule it, war  once again  stands  before its  gates, revolutions are shattering  theinternal peace of nations.  In the middle  of all this Germany lies like a quietisland, our beloved German  Fatherland and Reich.  Here  deep peace reigns.While  in other countries the peoples no longer  understand  each other  and menstrive with one another, estate comes into conflict with estate, class fights againstclass, we here are bound together in peace.  Some days ago a  man in  anotherEmpire said  dictatorships may only too easily lead, as a result of their internaldifficulties, to war&apos;; to this we  reply that most wars result from the nature ofdemocracies.  We do  not need to fight a foreign war in  order to be united,  but.here we are and here we stand, one people, one army and one Reich.&quot;       [12690]                                                    c  2
Prick, October 12, 1935.     &quot; I believe there is no one among us who is not happy tnat the Fiihrer tookthis decisive step  [withdrawal from  League] two years ago.&quot;  In its existenceup to the present  the  League had shown  itself  in no way  fitted to  fulfil itsnominal task of furthering peace  and reconciliation among  nations.  It couldeven be said that the League was the  cause and origin of new wars.  &quot;Our war,the war which Ave are waging, is against hunger and cold.  We want to conquer-nothing but our own people.&quot;Goring, November 2, 1935.     &apos;&apos; May the French at last divest themselves of the crazy illusion that weare only longing to attack France some day.  We have learnt to know one another in the Great War of the nations, and we esteem one another.   We do not requireto measure our strength once more in a clash of arms.   We prefer to be rivalsin peaceful labour.   I am convinced that just as the German nation wishes peace,so the French nation longs for nothing more than peace.  But this  peace  doesnot depend on us alone; and, therefore, we  have ourselves taken steps to securethat this peace shall not be so lightly disturbed so far as we are concerned.  the rearmament of Germany is therefore a positive  contribution to  peace.   Now,however, that Adolf Hitler has given back to the  German people its sword, wecan be reassured, and that is precisely the reason for which the nation is attachedto him with such magnificent  devotion.  It  is natural that we should give himall that we have.  When he calls we shall come, and all he requires shall be givento him.&quot;Goring, December 6, 1935.    &quot; Our goal is  clear.  Germany must recover her place in the sun.&quot;   &quot; Wehave not rearmed in order to have parades or to indulge in militaristic feelings,nor to  oppress  other nations,  but in order to  serve world peace and  our peace.....  We have had to recognise that a defenceless people  can provokeits  neighbour to  do  certain things which  cannot possibly be covered  by the conception of peace.  We are certainty in  favour of international agreement,but it is for this reason that we have rearmed,  since this international under-standing has its own manners,  its own tone and its own  language.....   Thereare sometimes extraordinarily deaf partners,  and the attention of these can, whenall other means have failed, only be aroused by the powerful voice of guns.  Wehave through our rearmament taken steps to see that we shall  be properly heard in regard  to international agreement.&quot;Schacht, Leipzig, December 6, 1935.    His  Majesty&apos;s  consul  at  Leipzig is  informed on  good  authority that dr. Schacht spoke without notes, and that much of what he  said  was omitted from the published reports of the speech.  The Minister is said to have referred in veiy strong terms to the  grave  threat  to Germany&apos;s  export  trade of  a continuance of the  boycott caused  by irresponsible  anti-Jewish measures.  he pointed out that without an adequate  volume of exports it would not be possibleto import the essential  raw materials for the armaments industry.  Accordingto His Majesty&apos;s consuFs  informant, Dr. Schacht went on to say  that it  hadtaken the  founders of the  Second Reich from 1870 until  1914 to reach a positionof military predominance in Europe.  What  their predecessors had accomplishedin forty-four years, they would have to achieve in the short space of four years.It was therefore imperative that all minor differences of opinion and grievancesshould be forgotten in the common  determination to complete the gigantic task which lay ahead of them.Hitler, January 15, 1936.    &quot; You all know that the future  will offer us no  roses, and that for everythingwe  need and must have we shall be obliged to make  sacrifices  and to fight hard.The final victory will always remain  with him who can hold out and keep hisnerve.&quot;
Goebbels, Berlin, January 17, 1936.    The reports of this  speech  are  known  to have  been heavily censored,  but,according to the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, Dr. Goebbels  said :  &apos;  It  was always necessary to choose the right moment. In 1933 the moment had not comefor military freedom.  When the time came we took advantage of the moment when  there was least risk.   For ourselves we feared no risk,  but  only  for thepeople, and it would be criminally irresponsible to run risks without being forcedto do so by circumstances.   In  every great action  there was  a risk.   To actaccordingly  was the task of leadership.  &apos; We  at least try to force our  way through difficulties not merely with  the strength of the lion, but  also with thecunning of the serpent.&apos;  ....  One day the time would come when germany would be obliged to demand colonies also  from the world.  Things  could not goon for ever as they were now.   Germany  had no colonies and no raw materials and must make her way  in life as best she could so long as she  was deprived ofthe space necessary for her life and trade.  A laud so over-populated as Germanyneeded this  space.  No far-seeing person in the  world could  deny this claim.Germany&apos;s colonies had been  taken from her, although the others had  no need ofthem  and did not know what to  do with them.  If Germany remained neutral inthe Abyssinian conflict it was not because she did not understand that a peoplelike the Italians must be  allowed to live if the danger of an explosion were to be avoided.  Whether the methods  which were applied  in  this case were right wasa matter into which he would not go, but, as far  as the question of principle was concerned, people  must  have understanding  for the nations  which  possessednothing.....Thanks to the Nazi regime, Germany had now a definite foreignpolicy.  The first essential for a foreign policy  was secure frontiers.  The newarmy  had brought peace  to the world because it was no longer  possible  to treatGermany as a  defenceless  State, and other countries were  obliged to speak toher as a free and sovereign nation.   With this army at  his back the Fiihrer was able to conduct a proper  foreign policy, but he would assure foreign  journaliststhat,  although  perhaps in internal affairs there were here and there misunder-standings and  differences of opinion, at  a,nj rate in foreign  policy the wholenation was united.  Speculations based on the possibility of a division of opinion in this respect were bound to go wrong.&quot;  Referring,  apparently, to sanctions against an aggressor, Dr. Goebbels then said that if Germany  had to wait four or five months for  the intervention of the League, it  would be of little use to hereven  if eventually perhaps she  got  theoretical justice.   What  others possessedGermany must also possess;  she would not agree to be treated  as a pariah.  Itwas only rogues who could  have signed that which deprived Germany of hermeans of livelihood; if a treaty had once become intolerable there were higherlaws  than those which were written  in ink.....While disclaiming all desireto enter into an argument with the head of a foreign State, Dr. Goebbels wishedto make a few observations on  President Roosevelt&apos;s recent  speech.  When theUnited  States had declared war and other  Western States had opened  the war against Germany,  they were  democracies, and not autocracies.   No century had seen so many wars as the &quot; democratic &quot; 19th century.   It was  also much easier for a democrat to  start a war than for an autocrat, who must himself meet theresponsibility for that war.   Germany at least should not be called an autocracy.There&apos; was certainly no country in which the Government depended so  much uponthe people as in Germany.  That was an ennobled form of democracy.    The following is reuter&apos;s account of  the speech :     &quot; We are a poor nation.  We have no  colonies, no  raw  materials.   But wemust  tell the other nations that the time will come when we must demand ourcolonies back.....It  will not do that we continue to live as a  poor countrywhile the rest of  the  world  is  rolling in  wealth.   We are beggars.   We are confronted with difficulties which we cannot overcome by interior methods.  Theethers do not need the colonies which they have taken from  us.  We  wish toremain  neutral, but we  understand that a nation like Italy  must live.  It  is dangerous for  the world not to concede such demands, because  some  day thebomb will explode.....We can well do without butter, but not without guns,because butter  could not help us  if we were to be attacked one day.  Some peoplesay there is  a world conscience which is the League  of Nations, whose part it isto preserve the peace of  the world, but I  prefer to rely on guns. ....   people have  said that we could  not  conclude international  treaties.  May  I  draw your
attention to the Anglo-German  Naval Pact,  which some politicians would have-considered an impossibility a year ago.  To-day there is an authority in germany which carefully grasps every situation which leads to advantage to us.   Withthe army in his grasp, the Leader can pursue a good  foreign policy.....   Ifwe had  waited  for  the  Disarmament Conference to decide, we would still bewaiting  to-day.   Sometimes there are moments when one has to take the swordand cut  the knot.  We do not want to interfere with the conflict between GreatBritain and Abyssinia on the one hand, and Italy on the other, but Germany islearning a lesson from the situation.  That  is,  that a nation without  power isnot able to preserve peace, even if she is willing  to do  so. and that we cannotrely on the  League  of Nations.  If we had been the Government in power atthe time of  the  Versailles Treaty we would not have signed the treaty, because there are laws Avhich are more important than words written in ink.  If anyoneto-day should try to force us to do a thing Avhich  is against our interests we-would know how to  defend  ourselves.  ....  Those nations who conclude  pactswith Soviet  Russia must know that bolshevism will finally devour them.  If Redarmies should ever try to cross our frontiers to bring bolshevism to Germany, we will prevent it Avith our good old Guard regiments, for we are not only a peacefulisland, but also a fortified island.....  We must become  a nation of martyrs,because we have certain tasks to fulfil in the world.&quot;Goebbels, Cologne, January 24, 1936.  (N.B. This speech was heavily censored.)     &quot; Up till 1933  we  had  no foreign policy, only an  acceptance  of foreigndictates.  The &apos; foreign policy heroes&apos; of that epoch have vanished without leaving a trace.   Of all their efforts there stands out not one outstanding performance of which one can say &apos; It will last for a century.&apos;  But a century hence one willrecord the reconstruction of the German army between 1933 and 1936 with just as much  reverent awe as we (now) record the reconstruction of the Prussian armybetween  1806 and 1813.  The army  does not exist to make war but to  preservepeace.  The army seiwes therefore no domestic political end,  it stands on  thefrontier and sees that German labour enjoys its protection.   We are an armouredisland of peace and we will be able to preserve this peace.   We do not belong tosabre rattlers, but we stand  for our  rights.   We emphasise this plainly and clearly and say :  &apos; We wish to insure our position like others have done,&apos;  Perhapsgreat nations will fall into  strife with one another; then we  Avish to remainneutral.   We do not wish to bleed in the interests of others as has happened so often in  German history.  We take our hide to market only for German  interestsand therefore we Avill preserve neutrality in any conflict which does not concernus.  But this neutrality is no expression of weakness; it is now an expression of strength when we have  an  army standing behind  us.  We are observing very closely though we say nothing.  Chess players  are  generally accustomed  to  besilent.&quot;     According to a report from the  French consul-general at Cologne, who was.present at the meeting, Dr. Goebbels  said that Germany could not permit herselfa mistake, and that she  was therefore proceeding with  circumspection, thoughevery question would be  dealt with one after the other and at the proper  time;that the German people  required territorial expansion and that the plans weremade; that the role  of the army was to be on the frontier;  that&apos;as in chess one might sometimes intentionally lose a paAvn if the result Avas the gain of a queen at alater stage;  that it was not sufficient to put forward one&apos;s intentions in an astutemanner,  but that it was necessary to be able to  realise them; that that had beendone on the 16th March,  1935, when Germany claimed freedom to arm, but beforetelling the world that she was going to rearm she had taken care to have rearmedfirst.Hitler, Munich, January 26, 1936.     This speech Avas very strictly  censored, but His Majesty&apos;s consul-general atMunich  reports  that: &quot;The Chancellors theme Avas the strength of Germany,her  independence  of the League of  Nations and of friendships or  alliances.&quot;He also  referred with great  emphasis to the  &quot; White man&apos;s  burden,&quot; saying,&apos;&apos; Europe needs raw materials and colonies and the white race is  destined to rule,owing to its heroic conception of life.&quot;  He Avarned his hearers, however, that if
the ruling nations faltered, if they made the mistake of teaching colonies to becomeself-governing, they would be rejected with  the  words:  &quot;We  no longer  needEurope.&quot;     In the speech there were  specific references to India, and one statement was-said to be as follows :       &apos;&apos; We must remember that India did not send a deputation to London tosay :  &apos; Please teach us how to walk.&apos;  On the contrary, the English went out toIndia  to teach the Indians how to  walk  in British fashion.  It was a painfulprocess.   The Indians  insisted on walking in their own fashion, while the Britishfelt bound to teach them  the British method of walking.   But it took them 150years to do this.&quot;     The  Chancellor  further asked:  &apos;&apos; By  what  right  do  nations  possess-colonies? By the right of taking them.&quot;Schacht, Breslau, January 29, 1936.     The  speech  is believed to have been  considerably censored.  The  accountpublished in the  Daily Telegraph of the 30th  January reads as  follows:       &quot; Everyone who comes to Upper  Silesia must realise the unexampled madnessof the Versailles Treaty,  which tore apart factories which  were economicallyconnected and thus destroyed  much of value.     &quot; One can only hope  that the great injustice once caused  by  the folly ofpoliticians will one day be made good.     &quot; This is no call for  revenge or for a new  war.  Germany  desires peace soas to pursue under its  banner her work of recovery.  It is, however, desirable,for economic reasons, that successful co-operation be reached by peaceful methodson this and on the other side of the  frontier.     &quot; You may be sure that we shall  always know how to guard the soil of UpperSilesia with the strength of the spirit and of the fist.  We in Berlin understandyour needs and anxieties.   We wish to help to  maintain and develop  the industry of Upper Silesia.  It is no lost outpost, but a piece of German earth.&quot;Hitler, Berlin, January 30, 1936.     &apos;&apos; Just as they had always preached to the people the necessity for peace andunity at home, so would the new Germany be an element of peace among the other nations.   That could not be said often enough.  The German people sought peacebecause they loved it.  They sought honour only because they could not live without it.  For fourteen years before obtaining power the Government had preached thisgospel.   For three years they had now been putting it into practical effect.  Theywould, in the future  abandon nothing of that which had now for  seventeen years been the  essence of  their  whole  life.   The world must realise  this.  germany would remain devoted  to peace for a people could only want peace-so long asthe honour of the German nation was not affected.   Those who believed that  theycould treat Germans like slaves would find, that they were a refractory race, as theNational Socialists had proved refractory to those who had attempted to misusethem or maltreat them at  home.   It was to be hoped that a better understandingfor the rights of all nations would gain ground in the world, for this Avas the firstcondition for the establishment of a real peace  among the peoples.&quot;o
