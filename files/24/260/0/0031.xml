I think thatthey may prove  of interest to the Cabinet,  as  representing the personal impressions ofa competent observer.                                                                          D.  C.    THE WAE  OFFICE,          2nd March, 1936.     1.  During my stay in Egypt I have  had many discussions on the treaty question    0143with  British officials, ex-officials  and  business men, and  also with  some  Egyptians.    2687Naturally views vary greatly  as to  what is desirable  and what is  obtainable -Quothomines tot senteniiae.  It  is, of course, dangerous to form fixed opinions based on ashort visit and  an incomplete  sounding of opinions.  Nevertheless, from  all I have heard and seen, I have come to the following conclusions :      (a)  That sane Egyptian opinion,  generally, is honestly in favour of concluding a           treaty.   Even the King probably wants  a treaty  now as the surest means           of handing over a stable Egypt to his son, and the Wafd, with the possible           exception of the Copt element, though  thriving in opposition,  want it as           essential to their Nationalist aims.     (b)  That it would  be to our advantage,  as well  as  to  that  of Egypt, if a treaty           safeguarding our essential  interests were concluded.   In all the dangers in           Europe and in the Far East which  lie ahead of us, a contented and friendly           Egypt is greatly to be desired.   A treaty may not produce a contented and           friendly Egypt, but without a  treaty we  shall always  be faced with a           simmering Egypt awaiting our embarrassment to attain her ends.     (c)  That  the moment is  favourable for  concluding  a treaty, firstly,  because           British prestige stands high and  the Egyptians are generally well disposed           towards us, but more particularly because the threat of Italian  aggression           has brought about a general recognition of the fact that Britain  and Egypt           are necessary, the one  to the other.     (d)  That if the treaty negotiations fail and if they fail the blame will be put on           us, whatever  the  facts there  will  be  serious  anti-British  disturbances,           particularly on the part of the students, who are completely out  of hand.           From a purely military point  of view, we have  adequate forces to quell such           disturbances, but it will mean shooting with the usual &quot; martyrdoms &quot; and           lasting bitterness.   If the treaty  negotiations fail it must be  demonstrable           that their failure was in no way due to unreasonableness on our part.  This           will  not prevent  the disturbances,  but the  martyrs&apos;  crowns will  lack           lustre.   There is also  the possibility of a &quot; black-coat &quot; strike which would           paralyze essential services.   This would  be serious were it to last long, but           in view of the probable lack of cohesion among the strikers,  this is unlikely.     (e)  That in the treaty negotiations the military clauses are likely to present great           difficulty in respect to the location of British troops and, to a less degree,           in respect to the setting of a time limit within which Egypt can shoulder           complete  responsibility for her  own defence.   The  size  of the force  we           retain  in Egypt is unlikely to present any difficulty it probably need not           even be specified (see also paragraph 3 on military clauses).
     (/) That  since amour propre  looms so large in the  Egyptian mind, much will            depend upon our  proposals,  particularly our  military proposals, being put            forward with  tact, complete honesty and  full regard to known  Egyptian            susceptibilities.   If this is done, they have  a  reasonably  good chance of            being accepted.     (g) That the  Egyptians  are  little interested in the  Sudan  but  eel they must            demand some token there to appease  their amour propre.  Nevertheless,            the Egyptian Press will not be silent on this matter.     2.  Having, rightly or wrongly, recognized Egyptian independence and expressedour willingness to conclude a  treaty with her, I am convinced that we should say or do nothing that will imply that we regard Egypt as potentially hostile, that we intend toretain surreptitiously, if not overtly, the whip-hand over  her, or that in certain circum-stances  we intend to intervene in her internal affairs.  If Egypt can be convinced thatwe honestly intend to give her virtual independence, she will be prepared  to  recognizeour  peculiar interests and  accept  our guidance.   The alternative to  accepting ourpowerful assistance is  too unpleasantly  certain for Egyptians  lightly to contemplate.They realise that, had we not  been in  Egypt, there  would have  been no Abyssinianquestion because  it would have been an Egyptian question.  They realise the necessityof retaining us as friends, and therefore the risk of their  turning against us, if a treatysatisfactory to both sides is  concluded, is in my opinion very remote.     In the treaty  negotiations  it will be essential to convince the Egyptians that anyconditions which we may demand are put forward solely as the best means of protectingEgyptian and&apos;British interests alike from foreign  interference, and not as a  means of protecting British interests  from possible Egyptian machinations, much less as a meansof saving  Egypt from herself.  And unless we are  honest in this regard we shall certainly not be clever enough to convince the Egyptians.     3.  In the conversations on  the military clauses there will,  as I have said,  be greatdifficulty in obtaining  agreement regarding  the location of British  troops  in  Egypt.British troops in or even near  Cairo or Alexandria,  particularly the  former, will be held to offend Egyptian amour propre and to  be inconsonant with sovereign rights.   Whenshown that on  purely military grounds it is necessary  to  have a force on the Canal forits immediate protection, another force at or near Alexandria to secure the port and as astarting point  for operations to  protect Egypt from the West, and  a central reserve at or near Cairo whence communications radiate, the Egyptian delegates will no  doubtagree that  the dispositions  are sound and that in an emergency  they would gladlyaccept them.   In an emergency, they  will say,  &quot; We will gladly place  every house inEgypt at the disposal of  the British, but are these  war dispositions really necessary in times of peace  ?  Troops in Cairo and Alexandria are to  us an army of occupation, infact if not in name, and such an army cannot be consonant with sovereign rights.&quot;     4.  To  counter this  objection  it can,  I  think,  be  explained that  we are  quite prepared to come out of their capital city ; it is the central position that is necessaryto us and not the Capital  city as such.     It can further be explained  that in an emergency it is usually politically inexpedient to make military moves, that if the Egyptian Army is to become really up-to-date and efficient its units must traiii in close conjunction with those of the British Army, andfurther that headquarters and  communications, which take time to establish, should,when possible, be maintained in peace where  they will  be required in  war.   At themoment there is  a  strong desire on the part of the  Egyptians to have the  Britishsoldier living on  the edge of  the desert  ready to give  assistance when required.   But,apart from  the arguments  which I have outlined above, it is not unlikely that reasonableEgyptians may be  led to see that it is possible to ask  too much of an army with whichit is  in their interests to keep on close and friendly  terms.     5.  Our treaty  with  Iraq is likely to be quoted as a precedent to follow.   It can,however, be convincingly  argued that this precedent is not a good one.   No one wantsIraq, in which foreign interests, apart from oil, are small, whereas there are few countriesin Europe which  have not at one time or another cast covetous  eyes on Egypt.(B36/8) 70 3/36  W.O.P.  9329
