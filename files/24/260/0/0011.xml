                                                                :  186    f THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;1 S GOVERNMENT ),fgCRET.                          CABINET                   COPY NO.  &apos;:4__.P.  1.6  (36 ) . ;--                 PRIVATE STREET WORKS.                Memorandum by the Minister of Health.             1.   I desire to obtain Cabinet authority for the        introduction of a Bill dealing with the subject of Private        Street Works which was included in the list  submitted by the        Home Affairs Committee and approved by the Cabinet        (Cabinet 51(35), Conclusion 4).   The Bill will be a short one        and has in substance been agreed with the Association of        Municipal Corporations, the County Councils&apos; Association, and        the Association of Urban District Councils,  the three bodies        principally concerned.             2.   The main object of the Bill is to  replace by a        single code the two existing codes on this subject (Ss.150-152        of the Public Health Act, 1875, and the Private Street Works        Act, 1892) which at present operate in different parts of the        country.             3.   The new code will be based mainly  on the Private        Street Works Act, 1892, but will make a number of minor        amendments in that Act and in particular will introduce a        procedure under which a local authority will have power        (subject, in the case of any local opposition developing, to        confirmation by the Minister of Health) to lay down in advance        standards of construction for different classes of street.        The authority would then apply the appropriate standard to        each  new private street when the time came to take it over,        the frontagers being given a right of appeal to the Minister.        AH other matters in dispute between the authority and the        frontagers would, as under the Act of 1892, be determined by        the  justices.
187             4,    The Bill -would also contain a provision based on a        number of  local Act  precedents to the effect that no house may-        be  erected unless it  is provided with proper access.             5.    I am anxious to secure the Bill in the present        Session  not only because such a measure is overdue but because        the  consolidation of  the Public Health law is now proceeding        and  its  value would  be much enhanced if the new private streets        code  can be incorporated.                                           (Intld. )  K.W.13th February, 1956.
