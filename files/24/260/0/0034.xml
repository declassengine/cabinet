S DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT).                    CABINET.                   THE CORONATION.   Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.     I wish to-bring to the notice  of the Cabinet the procedure by which the preparations far a Coronation are initiated, andto suggest that the date of the Coronation itself is a matter which should, receive early consideration.     The preparations are formally  set in motion by the appointment by The King in Council of a Coronation Committee of the privy Council and a Court of Claims.   The Coronation Committeedeals with the general arrangements, and the Court of Claimsdetermines the rights of those claiming to be entitled to perform services at the Coronation.   Although the two bodies are distinct, their membership is the same.     On the Accession of King Edward VII, the coronation committee was given power to appoint an.Executive Committee,and both in 1901 and 1910 it was the Executive Committee whichundertook the detailed work and drew up the form of Ceremonialto be used in the Abbey.   It is clearly desirable that thesame course should be followed on this occasion.     Prior to 1901, the Coronation  Committee was a Committee ofthe whole Council.   At the last two Coronations, it consisted of some forty Privy Counsellors (with a quorum of five)including the Great Officers of State and those Members of theCabinet whose Departments were concerned with the preparations.     The Executive Committee, of which the Earl Marshal isChairman and the Archbishop of Canterbury a Member,  is in theC R E T.393C.?. 67 (56).
main a Committee of permanent officials representing the RoyalHousehold and various Government Departments ,-     The Coronation Committee and the Court of Claims are appointed at a &quot;Coronation Council&quot; which is usually held beforethe exact date of the Coronation has been fixed but not untilthe month in which it will take place is settled.   At the lasttwo Accessions, the Council was about a year before the dateproposed for the Coronation.   In both years, the coronation committee and the Executive Committee merely held preliminarymeetings and then adjourned until the autumn.   During thisadjournment, the various Departments concerned were able toprepare much necessary material.     Although the Coronation Council need not be held immediately the First Commissioner of Works has drawn my attention to thefact that the interests both of efficiency and economy require that his Department should be able to make a start on the workfor which they will be responsible, without delay, and he thinksit desirable that early steps should be taken to co-ordinate theactivities of the various local authorities in London concernedwith street decorations.   He also suggests tiiat weatherconsiderations indicate a date for the Coronation not earlier    !than the second week in May, while on the other hand after theend of the third week in that month seatholders in the important I                                                                 Istands in the Mall and in Constitution Hill would be unable to                                                                 see the Procession, as the trees,  which in 1911 were smaller,will then be in leaf and obstruct  the view.     There are other considerations which will have to be takeninto account.   The effect any date contemplated might have on commercial activities is a question on which the Board of trade will be able to advise.    The Dominion Governments,  also,  willexpect to be informed before a decision is taken.    In addition,it has been suggested that the Coronation should be  during theImperial Conference.    These and possibly other factors  will havel
                                                         HQS                                                         *i %t Mto &quot;be weighed before any recommendation can be made to The King.     The First Commissioner of Works is very directly interestedin the question, and I share his view that the date should bedecided as soon as possible.   The preliminary enquiries whichare likely to take some little time should therefore in myopinion begin without delay.     I therefore recommend that the necessary preliminaryenquiries with regard to the date of the Coronation should be started forthwith,  for which purpose I suggest that the appoint-ment of a Cabinet Committee might be considered.    When these enquiries have reached the stage at which it is possible torecommend an approximate date for the Coronation,  I would propose,with the concurrence of the prime Minister,  to advise  The Kingthat the general procedure outlined in the second  and  thirdparagraphs of this  Memorandum should be followed.
