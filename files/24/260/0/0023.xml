February 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy  No.CP. 56  (36).CABINET.ADMISSION OF WOMEN TO THE DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR                             SERVICES.        Memorandum  by  the Secretary of S-tate  for Foreign Affairs.    IT will be recollected  that in 1934 an inter-departmental enquiry was heldinto the question of the admission of women into the Diplomatic  and Consular ,Services.    The  Committee  agreed,  with  two exceptions,  that  it  would  be inadvisable to admit women to the Consular Service at the present  time.   Asregards the Diplomatic Service,  four members of the Committee  held that thearguments against the admission  of women definitely outweighed those in favour,and these four members accordingly recommended no change  in the existing position.   Two members held  a  contrary view and  recommended that  women should be eligible for  admission to the Diplomatic Service  on  the same terms as men.   The two  remaining members of tile Committee were  in  favour of admitting  women  to  the  Diplomatic  Service  for  a  limited  period  as  aidexperimental measure.    The Cabinet discussed the matter on the 28th November, 1934, and agreed :      (a)  That the Report of  the  Committee on the Admission of Women  to the           Diplomatic  and Consular  Services should be published;    (b)  That  when the Report  was  published it should be accompanied by a           statement  that  the  Government  accepted  the conclusions  of the           majority  in regard  to the  Diplomatic Service,  namely,  that the           arguments against the admission of women to that Service definitely           outweigh  those in favour, and have accordingly decided to make no           change  in  the existing position; and also the  conclusions  of the           majority in regard  to the Consular Service, namely, that it would be           inadvisable  to admit women to this Service; the statement in question           to set out the Governments reasons for these conclusions;    (c) To request the Secretary of  State for Foreign Affairs  to prepare and           circulate to the Cabinet for  consideration the draft of  the statement           to accompany the Report of  the Committee when published.    For various reasons this decision of the Cabinet was never  acted upon.  a fairly constant interest has, however, been evinced in this matter by members ofthe House of Commons, and  I  think  the time  has  now come  when furtherconsideration should be given to  the question of publishing this  report.  On thewhole, the balance of advantage seems to me to lie in the publication of the reportof the inter-departmental committee together with a covering statement as decided by the Cabinet in November 1934.    In the circumstances I would recommend that the previous decision of theCabinet in this matter should be confirmed, and I am circulating to my colleaguesherewith the draft of a statement to  accompany the report.  For convenience ofreference the latter  is being recirculated  separately and will  be found in cp. 243 (34).                                                                  A. E.    Foreign Office. February 20,  1936.S403  [12784]
                                ENCLOSURE.                              Draft Statement.    The Report of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service 1929-31 (Cmd. 3909)made the  following recommendation in regard to the Diplomatic and consular services :         &quot;415. Diplomatic  and Consular Services. In our view  the  question    whether women should be admitted to these services  raises issues of high    policy which can only be determined by Your Majesty&apos;s Government.  We    note that this matter was reviewed by them at the time of the passing of the    Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act.   We  think that the question should not    be  regarded  as settled  for all time by  the decision then reached.  Having    regard to the time which has since elapsed,  we recommend that Your Majesty&apos;s    Government should again examine the position at an early date.&quot;    2.  The Royal Commission, therefore, expressed no definite view, but merelyenjoined that the question of the admission of women to these services  should again be examined.  It was, accordingly, the duty of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto consider  whether the general interests of the State would be better served ifwomen were admitted to these two Services or excluded as they are at present.   Toenable His Majesty&apos;s Government the better to decide this question they caused acommittee of Civil Servants to be set  up to advise on the matter, and after carefulconsideration the Government have decided to  adopt the views of the majority ofthat committee in the case of both the  Services in question.  In taking this decisionHis Majesty&apos;s Government must not be thought to be criticising the Sex Disquali-fication (Removal) Act or questioning the advantage of the employment of women in the Home Civil Service.  On the contrary, they  fully recognise the eminentservices rendered by women in all grades of the Civil Service in this country andthe positive advantages which have accrued to the Service by their admission toit.  They are, however, convinced that the time has not yet arrived when womencould be employed either  in the Consular  Service or in the Diplomatic service with  advantage to the State or with profit to women.  Their  reasons for thisview are as follows :     3.  To take first the Consular Service.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have  been much impressed by the virtual unanimity of  the Committee upon  the inadvisa-bility of admitting women to this Service.  It is true that two members of thecommittee recommended that a test of the fitness of women for this Service shouldbe made by seconding a selected number of women officers from the Home service to the Consular Service, but the Government feel  that they would not be justifiedin giving effect to such a recommendation  unless they were reasonably certainthat some definite advantage would be secured to  the State by such action.  Theyare not satisfied that  this  would be  the case.   In  the very large majority of consular  posts officers have to deal with a number of matters which are in them-selves unsuitable for treatment by the average woman, and although it may bethat women  can and. do participate in this country in work of a kind analogous to that of Consular officers, it would be wrong  to compare conditions  in manyforeign countries to those prevailing  at home.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government areof the decided opinion that  women  would  in  practice find themselves hamperedand restricted  as compared with men if they endeavoured to carry  out  Consularduties abroad,  with the result that women consular officers  would not be able togive such efficient service to the State and to British subjects  requiring their assistance as men.  In the general interest, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfind themselves bound to accept  the recommendation of the majority  of  the-committee.     4.  As regards the Diplomatic Service, on which the views of the committeeare much more divided, His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered thethree recommendations in the committee&apos;s  report and, considering  that the truecriterion  in such a matter must be the interest  of  the State, they have reached theconclusion that the  recommendation signed by  four  members&apos; of the committeeshould be adopted, namely, that no change should be made in the existing position.To throw the  Service open to women without any  restriction  appears to His
                                      3Majesty&apos;s Government to be, at present at any rate, undesirable.  Strong opinion has been expressed that, in view of the habits and customs of many countries,the employment  of women  in  diplomatic work would not  prove  successful.Admittedly, there can be no proof of this until  the experiment is tried, but ifthe experiment were attempted and proved unsuccessful, His Majesty&apos;s  Govern -ment  consider that not only would  it be difficult  to close an  avenue once openedto women,  but considerable injustice might be caused to the individual women who had entered the Service.  The recommendation proposed by two membersof the committee that women  should be permitted to enter for a limited period,seems to His Majesty&apos;s Government to be open to the serious objection that overso short a  period no  proper judgment could be formed of the fitness of womenfor the work of diplomacy.  It is likely that over seven years few women wouldbe successful  in the  examination  and it would prove  impossible conclusivelyto test the fitness of  women by appointing them in sufficient  numbers  to thosecountries where prima facie their employment would be undesirable.    5.  But, apart from these reasons. His Majesty&apos;s  Government foresee great difficulties  and inconveniences in the employment of women in  the  diplomatic service at present.  It must be remembered that  an essential element  for success in diplomatic life consists in the members of the Service being favourably  received in the countries  to which they are posted.   If  they  are not  so received theirusefulness  is greatly  diminished and their mission is likely  to fail.   There are,however, many countries where the  position of women is very different from what  it is  in  this country.  With  very few exceptions the  experiment  has notbeen made  by other countries and His Majesty&apos;s Government  are satisfied that ina large number of countries the innovation, would not be welcomed.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment consider that they would  not be justified in risking the efficiency of the service as a whole in order to give an opportunity to the relatively smailnumber of  women who are likely to wish to adopt the Diplomatic Service as a career.    6.  Marriage also presents a problem of great difficulty.  At present a verylarge proportion of  the members  of  the  Service marry and  it is  universallyadmitted that  the wives  of members of the Service contribute  very greatly tothe success of  their husbands&apos;  careers.  The existing marriage bar, which applies to women in all branches of the Civil Service, would automatically preclude womenmembers of the Diplomatic Service from marrying, and even were the marriagebar relaxed, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that insuperable  difficulties wouldensue.  For instance, a woman could not be permitted to remain in the Serviceif she married a foreigner, and in practically every case it would be impossiblefor the husband of a woman diplomatic officer to exercise any  profession in thecountry in  which his wife was serving.    7.  Finally, His  Majesty&apos;s Government do not  consider that any  substantialinjustice is being done to women by their continued exclusion from the  diplomatic service.  It is, to say the least, doubtful whether women are suited to this Serviceowing to the conditions prevailing; it is equally doubtful whether the admissionof women would contribute any special advantage to the State;  lastly, the size ofthe Service is so small that the general question of the employment of women isin any event hardly affected.February 1936.
