SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED &quot;EASTERN  report&apos;&apos;;No!  III.     THE internal political situation siaows;little change this/week.    .oruT,fin:rjoi*j&apos;sfi&apos;&quot;./-)),&apos; sv. zvjiK.  -                       Egypt.                            j;  ^r;i;:   &quot;The flight  of the  Senussi from Siwa is a most satisfactory event, coinciding- as itdoes with a: good situation both in  Hejaz and Sinai.  The moral value of British troops as a whole in  the Egyptian  sphere of operations will  be increased by this turn  ofaffairs.                                                    ,           - - -woo                                      HEJAZ.                             Military Political Affairs.     The retirement of the Turks  from Bir Darwish to  Medina, and  the evacuation by them of Wej, Muwaila, and Daba  are encouraging, and show  that military andeconomic pressure combined with deterioration of communications are beginning  to be felt seriously by the enemy. The political interdependence between the Arab movementin Hejaz and our  Sinai operations is now becoming evident.   The Medina garrison wouldhave been  of great value to the Turks  in  Southern  Palestine,  and the  garrisons  ofArish,  Rafa; and the  Sinai ports  would probably  have  been the deciding  factor ifavailable for-the advance on Rabegh ; as matters stand the Turks have suffered on bothfronts  owing&apos; to  simultaneous action.   The combination of  the exceedingly irregularmotions of scattered Arabian tribes with the  formal movements of a scientific european army is a very  nice operation ; but not an impossible one, so long as both parties stickto their own methods and do not come into actual contact with  one  another.  It isworth noticing  that the Arabs can  do things we cannot do, and vice versd.  Abdullamarched  above 2,500  men some  630 miles over desert in  a  month, raised  hithertoneutral elements, captured convoys, and probably shook the Turks&apos; confidence  in thepossibility of an  advance on Rabegh, an operation impossible  for  Europeans;  on theother hand, our  mobile force  smashed  the  Turkish  defence  at Rafa which ten times-the number of Arabs could not have done.   As an Arab proverb says, &quot; The silversmithkens silverj the goldsmith gold.&quot;                      THE FRENCH IN HEJAZ AND ABYSSINIA.     French policy both in  Hejaz and in Abyssinia is showing a tendency to strain after an advantage.  Colonel Bremond,  whose guns and men  have never stirred from Suezsince they landed some months  ago, lately proposed to establish a  base  for aeroplanesat Akaba, supported  by Senegalese and British.   He  has  tried  gardeners, traders,banks, and hostels at Jedaah and now has evidently endeavoured to introduce a FrenchMoslem medical  mission into  Hejaz..1  In Abyssinia a similar line is being followed bythe French officials.  This  sort of policy benefits nobody;  least of all the French.  \.

                                      PRESS.    The folio wing appeared in the issue ;of the &quot; Daily Telegraph &quot; of the 15tbrEebruary,19 1.7 : -         &quot; A grand piano had been  brought, from  Paris, after enormous difficulties in    the  way of transport, and the shed was,a masterpiece of carpentry, and the engine     which  worked  the lights  was a very fine engine, though it froze during  the    performance.  . .  ;.  . And&apos; alLthJs &quot;wbrk&apos;vvouldf &apos;be!-utterly1&apos;destroyed-,&apos;hefcause  in     three days those Second Line  regiments were  moving  away.  (It often happens    like that !)  But it was good to see the crowd to  see that in all their make-up -  ; they are like the men  who have come out before and done  things, and endured all    things without a moan, and, because their  courage  is known, go singing the song    of the old soldier down the roads of France.  The Second Line has the right to sing     it now                                                                  &apos;   .&apos;                                &quot; &apos; I want to go &apos;ome!                                   I want to go &apos;ome !                         The Maxims spit and the Johnsons roar,                         I don&apos;t want to go to the Front any more;                         Oh ! let me go over the sea,                         Where the Allevmans can&apos;t get at me !                                   0 my:                               ..,., ...    ,!

In Russia  the Germans have always painted us as  a  frivolous, sybaritic, race ofmiddlemen,  who conceal cowardice beneath a semblance of jocularity.   There, are manyRussians who though  pro-Entente, yet, owing to this  propaganda,  believe that  theBritish soldier is a mercenary with little staying power.   In a distant  and: ill-informedmind such  a paragraph can only have the effect of reviving this idea if  it is dormant,or confirming it if it is not already fixed.                                . J   h     On  the Asiatic it can only have one effect, and that is to hold up our.army as done for and ready for peace.  It  is  impossible to imagine any  Oriental  political element-hostile to us-which would not  profit by this paragraph.                   j-u;;.tf..,;.:-v-:.The Turkish officers will read it out on parade by order, as they read  Mr. Ashmead-Bartletfs articles (see Lieutenant Shurbajis report);  the Egyptian intellectual seditionistwill  read it&apos; out  in  the cafes  of Cairo with a free translation (though it needs littleimprovement),  and probably point out that, now the English have conscription,  theyhate fighting as  much  as the  Fellahin,  who weep and mourn when called.up for service;  -it will  be  passed on  to Jeddah and Mecca by  the  pro-Turks  who  swarmthere ; and  it will be welcomed  and  used in India by all those who desire the-victory, ofour.enemies^ ..      .UaHl  BKILSR   J?im&amp;:&apos;ba,a saelsgsnyg yd  hniioqqvs  tmhdA%&apos;.us;.::.

Lord Milner telegraphed from Petrograd  on the  7th February that  the politicalsituation was -very obscure.   Things  were, he  said, going rather better, and if one  ortwo unpopular  Ministers could  be  got  rid   of, he  thought,  anything  like  serious trouble should be  avoided while the  war lasted.   He thought, too, that there couldbe no  doubt  as  to the  Emperor, the army, and the  people fighting to a finish ; the-danger was that internal dissensions would weaken and distract them.     Sir R.  Paget telegraphed from  Copenhagen on the  10th February [No. 694] thatthe Danish Minister at Petrograd had reported a. plot to remove the Emperor,  andthen  either  to  place  the Grand Duke  Alexander-on  the. throne or to  establish a.republic.       [898-30]                                                            B
Finance.     Lord MUner, in his telegram of the 7th February, said that we were going to be confronted with enormous demands, and all the  good of our other efforts would beundone by  a brusque refusal.  The  only thing  to be  done was  to get the demandsdown to  an  irreducible  minimum, and then to  reserve the decision for  discussion inLondon.                                   RUMANIA.                             The Evacuation of  Jassy.     Sir G. Barclay telegraphed [No. 72] on the 3rd February to amend his telegram ofthe  1st  February.   [See Eastern Report I, p. 2.]  He  had omitted  to  say that theRussian general headquarters stipulated that  instead of the evacuation  of the wholeof the Rumanian army into Russia, a large portion of the population  of Jassy andits neighbourhood  should be  evacuated  so as  to  ease the situation in regard  to thesupplies.                                     EGYPT.                                   The 8enussir     Successful operations have been carried out  against the main force of the SenussLwhich was located in the Siwa. and adjacent  oases.  Sayed Ahmed, the Grand Senussi,at once left  Siwa  (the principal  village  of the  Siwa oasis, about 170 miles south ofSollum) for Shiyata (11 miles west of Girba) with Mahomed Saleh, his commander-in-chief.                                  ABYSSINIA.                         Representatives at the Coronation.     When it was originally proposed that the English, French, and  Italian ministers at Adis Ababa should be especially accredited for  the occasion of the coronation of theEmperor, the Italian Government also intended to send  a representative from Erythreaand  the English  one from the Sudan.  In deference, however, to the wishes of theItalian  Government,  we  abandoned  the  idea of  sending  someone from  the Sudan[Telegram No. 221  to Sir R.  Rodd], and the Italian Government  then intimated thatno one would be sent from Erythrea [Rome telegram No. 126].   On the 5th february the French Embassy informed the Foreign Office  that the French Minister would be attended by the Governor of Jibuti, the commander of a cruiser, a captain of the Somalirifles, and six men ; and that M.  Briand  regretted that it  was too late to alter thearrangements.   Difficulties have also  arisen in regard to presents and decorations.  Onthe 27th January the Foreign Office received a memorandum from  the French Embassysaying that the  Italian Government had enquired of the French Government whetherit intended to confer decorations on the Empress and  Ras  Taffari, and  the FrenchGovernment had replied that they proposed to send presents.  The French government wished to know the intentions of  the English  Government.   The French Ambassador-was  informed on the 2nd February that His Majesty&apos;s Government also proposed to givepresents to the Empress and Ras Taffari, but would confer no decorations.   Three days later, on the 5th February)&apos;-, the French  Embassy informed the Foreign Office  that its government would give presents  to the Empress and  the principal personages of theGovernment, and  that the insignia of Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour would be conferred on Ras Taffari [Telegram to Lord Bertie No. 318].     Lord Bertie was instructed on the 5th February  to inform  M. Briand that HisMajesty:s Government  was seriously concerned  to learn  that the French Governmenthad  taken steps which would enable them to make considerably more display than was now possible for us to  do, and that it was  hoped  that M.  Briand would even then beable to cancel the arrangement made.     in a  telegram dated  the  7th  February, sent via Egypt,  and received on the 12th February,  Mr. Thesiger said that 500L  would be sufficient for  presents to theEmpress, and asked whether they could be taken by Major Pearson, as if this could bearranged they could discuss Tsana.  He said, too, that  he had asked for a decoration[for Ras Taffari], as the French and Italian Governments were decorating him.  On the 10th February  he telegraphed  again to  say that the commissioner of  the SomaliProtectorate had arrived with officers at the invitation of Taffari.
                          Present of Arms from France.     Sir R. Rodd telegraphed on the 7th February [No. 127] that the Italian Ministerof Colonies had expressed  the hope that the proposal of the French  Government tomake a  further  present  of  arms  to Abyssinia would  be  opposed  by  the BritishGovernment.   The Colonial Minister  pointed out that France&apos;s position in  Abyssiniawith its very small frontier and railwajr communication was very different from that ofGreat Britain and Italy with frontiers surrounding the  whole of Abyssinia ; he alsoremarked that  the  French  agents separated themselves  constantly from the policyagreed upon by Italy and ourselves.  He strongly deprecated the supply of arms, whichmight  fall into the  hands of those  who  might use them against us.  Mr.  Balfourreplied next day that he was only awaiting a confirmation of the report  by Mr. Thesigerto support the representations of the  Italian Government  in Paris [No. 275].  On the9th February a telegram [No. 9] was received from Mr. Thesiger saying that he believedthe information to  be  correct, and that the ai-ms  had been promised in return forthe  site  for a  railway  station  which  had  been given  them.  The AbyssinianGovernment had no pressing need for arms, and he recommended that  none  should beallowed to enter the country until arrangements for the prevention of the  arms traffichad been reached.                               Loan of Aeroplanes.     The Foreign Office telegraphed to Mr. Thesiger on the 8th February [No.  11]informing him  that  instructions had been sent by  War Office to G.O.C., Eg3pt, toarrange for the despatch of two aeroplanes, with pilots, which were to  be lent for sixmonths to the Abyssinian Government for purposes of demonstration.                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.                                 Arab Operations.     On the 21st January it was reported that the  Turkish barracks at Bab Kuhah atMedina  had been  blown up by a detachment  from Ali&apos;s  bodyguard.  On the  24thJanuary Ali captured Mijz, his casualties being  1  killed and 3 wounded.  On the 25ththe  Turkish main position at  Sath-el-Ghayir was bombed  by two of our aeroplanes;and  on the 28th January an aeroplane dropped proclamations on  the Turkish camp atthis  place, which  was again bombed from aeroplanes on the 2nd February, the campbeing then rather smaller  than it was on the 28th January [A.B. 707].  On the 8thFebruary Dhabah, on the Red Sea, 90 miles N.N.W. of Wejh, was occupied  by a partof Faisals force conveyed by sea: Dhabah had been evacuated on the previous day bythe Turks, who when retiring  had been attacked by Huweitat Arabs  under ShaykhAhmed Rafiyah and had  lost 50 men killed the survivors, covered by Turkish cavalry,succeeded in reaching the railway.  After the occupation of Dhabah the ship proceeded to Muweilan, 20 miles N. of Dhabah,  which  also  had been evacuated.   [A.B.  732 andSir R. Wingate, 10th February.]     An aeroplane  reconnaissance on the 4th  February reported Ali&apos;s camp at Faqir-el-Shifaiya.  On the  5th February a telegram from Colonel Newcombe reported that only70 of the Turkish garrison which evacuated Wejh on the  24th  January had reachedEl Ula,  it being reported that the rest had  been  killed  en  route.  [A.B.  707 ]  It isreported that there are 900  Turkish cavalry at  Tebuk,  a station  on the Hejaz railwayN.E. of Muweilah ; that Medina Saleh, a station on the Hejaz railway 135 miles N.W.of Medina., is strongly held ; and that the Turks are weakening  the  Medina  garrisonand  concentrating  on the railway [A.B. 732].     The Arab Bureau  on the  13th February transmitted [A.B.  745] a telegram dated the 11th February from  Jeddah saying that Fekri had arrived  at Medina  andthe Governor, Mesri, had left.   Haidar [the Turkish Sherit of Mecca] was preparing fora journey.  It was reported that the  enemy had retired from  Birdarwish, and  that theRehaia Hejala tribes had surprised an enemy caravan and captured two officers, thirteenrifles, and 100 camels.                         Financial Kelp for King Husain.     In reply to Sir R.  Wingate&apos;s application for  permission  to grant  money  to KingHussain [see  Eastern Report,  I, p. 3], Mr.  Balfour telegraphed on the 6th February      [898 30]                                                       B  2
[No.  104] that he might issue 50,OOOZ.  now, and  further sums  as  required up to100,000L  Mr. Balfour presumed that it would he necessary to supply this in gold,and asked whether any means could be suggested for avoiding this dangerous drain ongold resources.  He also asked whether these subsidies were  to be  regarded  as  loans;eventually repayable from the funds of the new Arab kingdom.                         Status of British Representative.    Sir  B.  Wingate telegraphed  on the  8th February [&quot;No.  123] suggesting  that colonel Wilson&apos;s title of &quot; pilgrimage officer &quot; should  be discarded, and that he  shoiddbe designated &quot; head of the  British Mission  in  Hejaz,&quot;  British officers and othersserving  with  him becoming members (military or civil) of his  mission.   Mr. Balfourreplied on the 11th February [No. 130] that he agreed in principle, but should prefer to postpone the change unless the matter were urgent.   He would communicate with sir B. Winffate again shortlv.                         French Moslem Doctors asked for.    Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir  B.  Wingate  on  the  10th  February [No.  123]informing him that the  French Ambassador had stated  that  King Hussain had askedfor Moslem doctors from French Northern  Africa :  Mr. Balfour was of opinion that to counter this we too should send doctors from India  or Egypt.                                  Ottoman Bank.    Sir B. Wingate telegraphed on  the  9th February [No.  127] that he thought ithighly probable that King Hussain might decide to close the Ottoman Bank at Jeddah,on the grounds that it had continued  to  trade  in spite of his  refusal to recognise it inHejaz, and  that the  continued existence  of a  bank so closely connected with Turkeyprejudiced him  in the eyes of  his  people.    Should  this be done, Sir R.  Wingateconsidered it very undesirable that any protest should be made, as at present we could best help the King  by interfering as little  as possible in  internal  matters.   KingHussain had privately expressed his  willingness to have a British bank in Hejaz, buthe would not at present allow any other nation to establish one.ASIR.                                Idrisi and Comfida.    Information was telegraphed from Aden on the 9th February [324 A.P.] that SirSayyid Ali El Morgbani&apos;s emissary (Shaykh Salih El  Bedawi) had returned from his visit to  Idrisi, and would leave for Khartum  shortly.   Comfida  was  the key  of thesituation ; if it were handed over to Idrisi  no doubt he would co-operate immediately and actively with King Hussain.NEJD.                                 Abdullah-al-Utq.    With reference to the Saiyid Mohammed Abdullah-al-Utq, mentioned in EasternBeport No. II at  p. 8, Sir  P.  Cox has  telegraphed ^No. 990]  that he  belongs to asherifal  clan, and was formerly agent at Constantinople to Imam  Yahiya.  He told sir. Cox&apos;s informant that he had been  sent  by  the Turkish Government to accompanyBiifaat Bey  and Ashraf Bey who were  conveying 40,0O0L  for the payment  of  theTurkish troops in Yemen.   The treasure was held up by Ibn  Saud  with  its escort offorty men.  Al Utq asked the informant to inform the British official at Koweit that he wished to seize the money and escape in  that  direction, returning to  Yemen throughKoweit.KOWEIT.    The Viceroy  telegraphed  on the 10th  February that  the  Indian government proposed, subject  to  the approval of Mr. Chamberlain, to recognise the successor ofShaykh Salim Ibn Mubarak after a short precautionary delay.[See Eastern Beport I, p. 8.]
                                     QATAR.    On the 26th December the Political Resident  in the Persian Gulf telegraphed tothe Government of India that subject to its approval he proposed to send 300 rifles, with100 rounds per rifle, to Shaykh Abdalla.   This proposal was approved by the indian government on the 10th January.             *                      SYRIA.                         A  Proposal of Colonel Bremond&apos;&apos;&apos;s.    Sir R.  Wingate telegraphed on the 5th February [No. Ill] that Colonel Bremondhad submitted a proposal to utilise, in conjunction  with a British  force  of similarstrength, two Senegalese battalions  from Jibuti and the French contingent at Suez toform an aircraft base  near Akaba for organising raids against the Hejaz railway.  SirR. Wingate held out no hope of the  offer being accepted.                          MESOPOTAMIA  AND  IRAK.                        Sickness among the Turkish Troops.    According to a Turkish  hospital orderly, who  deserted from Kirmanshah  on the25th November, there were then thirteen hospitals in  that town, each  containing anaverage of 300 sick ;  there were few doctors and a shortage of  drugs, and the deathswere  about fifty a day, mainly from dysentery and typhoid.   There were  also about1,80&quot;) sick at Asadabad, and the number was increasing owing  to insufficient hospitalequipment and clothing. A prisoner lately captured said that there had been a greatoutbreak of typhus among the Turkish troops in Irak.                                THE  CAUCASUS.     The road from Kerasund to Kara Hissar has been developed : the inhabitants alongit -were Greeks, and they have been collected, and  are now at Kara Hissar.                                     PERSIA.                              Relations with Germany.     Sir C.  Marling telegraphed  on  the 6th  February [No.  50] that  the  American Minister had been instructed to invite Persia to break off relations with Germany.                           The Proposed Bakhtiari Road.     Mr. Balfour telegraphed  on the 10th  February [No. 49], saying the Russian Government might object if  the road terminated in Isfahan, that  being in the Russian sphere; two courses were therefore open, either to approach  the Russian Government on the subject, or to endeavour to terminate the road outside that town.  A third course had been suggested as a possible solution :  about 3 miles from Kharaji, on the Lynch road, there was a track to Chigakhur some 9 miles distant, and if it were practicable to convert that  track of 9 miles  the  difficulty might be solved, as there was already a carriage road to Isfahan from Chigakhur.                                     Finance.     From a telegram sent by Sir C. Marling on the 2nd  February [No.  45], it appears that the Persian Government has&apos; proposed a reform of its financial system in place of the control contemplated by the English and  Russian   Governments ;  this suggestion, Sir C. Marling assumed, would  not  be favourably  considered  by the  two Governments. In this regard Mr.  Balfour telegraphed to  Sir G. Buchanan on  the 8th  February that he was decidedly of opinion  that resistance should be offered to the attempt  made  by the Persian Government to substitute reform for control.

                        DE.  DMOWSKT AND  POLAND    I met Dr. Dmowski ten  years ago, when  I was acting as correspondent of the daily News in Petrograd,  and had frequent opportunities of talking to him in the lobbyof the  Duma.  He was  elected to the second Duma as member for Warsaw, anddisplayed remarkable ability  as leader of the Polish party, which  was then made up  of forty-six members.  At that time the Government Press  represented him asan  extreme Polish nationalist and an  enemy  of  Russia, while the Radical and, inparticular,  the Jewish Press  attacked him furiously on account of his struggle in1904-6  against the revolutionary movement in Poland.  Under his leadership, thePoles of the second Duma  did not ally themselves with any of the  Russian parties,but as a rule  they supported the Constitutional Democrats, who in return  supportedthem in demanding autonomy for the Kingdom  of Poland.   Dr.  Dmowski  was instrong  opposition to the  Government, but his party supported the Government when a Bill for a new  contingent  of recruits was introduced, and did so, as the Polishspeaker on the Bill stated in the Duma, on the grounds that  they desired the RussianEmpire  to be strong and independent,  because they  did not wish their situation inthe Empire to depend on Russia&apos;s neighbours.  The statement was intended to  bea hit at German influences in Russia and meant to suggest that the Poles might placethemselves on the side of Russia if she adopted an anti-German policy.    This, indeed, was the keynote of Dr. Dmowskfs policy.  He was simply a Polishnationalist, anti-Russian  and also anti-German, but, seeing  in  Germany the greaterdanger to Poland,  his attitude  to Germany was always far more hostile than  to Russia.In the course of the last ten  years I have never found him swerve from this position.He welcomed the entente between Russia and England, because he held that it wasonly with the  help of France and England that Poland could recover her position asa nation.  He maintained that, in the event of  an  alliance of Russia with England, aswell as  France, it would be the  duty of the  Poles to place themselves on the sideof Russia in the case of war between Russia and Germany.    Before his election  to the Duma, Dr. Dmowski had built up a  position of para-mount influence in Poland and his activities were not limited to Russian Poland.  TheNational Democratic Party, which he led, and which he and some of his friends hadfounded  about the year  1897, had  its branches  in all  three parts of Poland.  its programme was to organise a common policy in all three parts, to  struggle against thethree Governments for national existence, and  to raise the level of the political andgeneral  education  of the workmen and peasants  in order to  mobilise them for thefuture struggle.  The Party rapidly gained ground in Austrian  and German poland and, when the Russian Duma was established, triumphed at the elections in practically all  constituencies.  In  this way Dr. Dmowski became  the  most powerful  man inPolish politics, commanding a great majority in Russian Poland, and  supported  bystrong elements in German and Austrian Poland.    The Anglo-Russian entente marks an important point in his political career, whichwas strongly influenced by it. He at once began to work openly for a compromise betweenthe Poles and the Russians.   The task  was a difficult one, for Russian policy at thattime became more and more anti-Polish.  Moreover, Dr. Dmowski was not sufficientlyflexible to ingratiate himself with the Russian Government.   On the other hand, hisenemies  in Poland exploited his  new pro-Russian  policy to  undermine  his influence.The Jews, in particular, resented the  line of policy he was adopting in  regard toRussia and they marshalled their very  considerable  forces against him, profiting  byhis absence in Petrograd.  In consequence, he resigned his position in the third Duma(in  1909) and returned to Poland  in order to further his new policy.  At that time hepublished a book  in Polish, Russian, and French (La Question Polonaise ; Paris : ArmandCoulin), to which  the late Anatole Leroy Beaulieu  contributed a remarkable  preface.In  this work Dr.  Dmowski  gave  a very far-sighted appreciation of the international situation.  The book had a  great success and contributed very much to the victory ofthe author&apos;s ideas in Poland.   He was, however,  obliged to fight a hard  battle forthem.  It was a considered part of his policy to wage war against Jewish influence in poland, and this he did  on  the ground that the Jews were irreconcilably anti-Russianin Poland and almost all of them were  pro-Austrian and pro-German.   He won that
 struggle at a great cost.  He was represented as an anti-Semite, and Jewish influence in Poland and abroad began to work against him.  In the years preceding the war he could not travel in Austrian Poland ; for the Austrian  authorities were afraid of his influence, declared him an enemy of the Hapsburg Empire, and threatened him with arrest.     After the outbreak of war the National Democrats,  the Realists (the old party of reconciliation with  Russia),  and  some  other  elements  united to organise a Polish National  Committee in Warsaw.   Their aim was to co-operate  with Russia against Germany and  to  represent  Poland.   Dr. Dmowski was  elected  chairman of the Executive Committee.  This committee was not officially recognised, indeed the Poles did not ask that it should be ; but it was unofficially tolerated.     In July 1915 a Russo-Polish committee was established at  Petrograd by decree of the Emperor to discuss the methods to be adopted to carry out the promises  made in the  Manifesto of  the  Grand Duke Nicholas.   Dr. Dmowski was appointed one of the six Polish members.   The Russians and Poles failed to agree and the committee ended its work in August 1915 with two different reports, Russian and Polish.  In November 1915 Dr.  Dmowski left Petrograd, by permission of the Emperor, for abroad.   His aim was to keep in contact with Poland, then occupied -by the enemy, to influence his fellow-countrymen in  favour of the Allies, and to work in the  countries of the Allies for a favourable solution of the Polish problem.     I will now  attempt to sum up the  political opinions  of Dr. Dmowski  as I have learnt them from him in the course of many conversations both before the war and since its outbreak.     He has a  profound belief  in the  vitality of Poland.  His country, he  holds, possesses  all the necessary elements for again becoming a great  European nation.  The Polish-speaking  population of Europe exceeds 20,000,000.  The Poles of the three parts of Poland have but one soul.  Their common desire is  the reunion of their country and its independence.  The intellectual life of  Poland is on a  level with that of great nations.  The economic development of  the country may also be favourably compared with that of others.  In the last fifty years the Poles  have shown great energy in the struggle for their national existence.  The most advanced and the most energetic Poles are those  of German Poland.     It is the aim of  Germany to destroy Poland.   If she  does not  annex any part of Russian Poland at present, it  is because she still has  too  much trouble with her own 4,000,000  Poles  and does not want to  increase their number in the  Empire. She intends, in the future, to annex Russian Poland, when the strength of the German Poles is broken.  The establishment of a  Polish Kingdom by the  Germans is only temporary.   That small  Kingdom, comprising  only a part of the  Polish  country with  12f  million  inhabitants,  separated from the sea by  German territory (German Poland), will be totally dependent, economically and politically, on Germany.  It will, moreover, be one of Germany&apos;s sources of supply for cannon-fodder in time of war.     The  establishment of the Polish  Kingdom  is part  of  Germany&apos;s Mittel Europa plan, by  which she hopes to keep under her control the  whole of Central  Europe, the Balkans, and Asiatic Turkey.     Austria-Hungary is in a position which prevents her from becoming an absolutely independent State.  Her two dominating nationalities, the Germans and the Hungarians, are in a minority in the Empire and cannot  keep their position without the help of Germany.   Moreover,  the Austrian Germans are as good  Germans  as the Reichs- deutschen;  Germany  is  for them a sort  of  super-fatherland,  and they have ceased to think about an Austria that is not hand and  glove with Germany.  If Austria is not destroyed in  this war,  her dependence on  Germany  will become still  greater. Hence  a  union  of Poland with Austria would mean  practically the same thing  as direct dependence on  Germany;  only it  would be  more fatal, for Austria  is a de- generate and corrupt State and contaminates all the peoples who fall under her rule.     In regard to  Russia: she is  unable to solve the Polish problem and to obtain any strong  influence over the minor nationalities of Central Europe  and the Balkans. She  cannot adopt a policy of recognising the rights of nationalities,  because within her territories there are too many different races, all with  a tendency to separatism.Russia  is  bound to  remain  a strongly centralised and national Empire, in order  to absorb these races little by little.   That is  the reason why she will never give Polandpolitical autonomy if that country remains part of the Russian Empire.  The governing classes  in Russia  are even opposed to the reunion of Poland, because they consider a  strong  Poland undesirable;   They fear that  she  might gradually establish her
influence in the vast territories of Lithuania, Volhynia,  Podolia, and the Ukraine, in parts of which Polish civilisation is  predominant.  It is on these grounds  that  theRussian Government refuses to give her Allies the right of intervening in the polish question and maintains that it is an internal problem  of the Russian Empire.  It ison  similar grounds that the representatives of the Government, in their declarationsabout the solution of the Polish problem, never speak of political autonomy.   On  thecontrary, in the last Russian communique, after the Austro-German proclamation ofa Polish State, stress was  laid on  the conservation of the principle of &quot; unity of state&quot;,which, in Russian political language, means one central Government for the whole empire and no separate Government for Poland.     Dr. Dmowski has no illusions as to the ability of Russia to solve the Polish problem.It is true that during the  last eight years he has worked among his fellow-countrymenin  favour of Russia; but he has  done so because he was  convinced  that  the firstcondition of a better future for Poland was the destruction of the power of Germany.He declares quite openly that he  is pro-Russian only so long as Russia is anti-German.It is his hope that, if Germany be defeated, the Polish question will be solved by  theWestern Allies of Russia, to whose interest it  is to strengthen those neighbours ofGermany  who will  oppose her expansion with  all their force.   He holds  that  thePoles,  especially those of German  Poland, have proved by their successful struggle against German aggression that they represent an important factor in the equilibriumof Europe.     Dr. Dmowski&apos;s opinion is that the result of the present war depends above all elseon  Great Britain.  If the  British nation  is able to make an effort  equal  to that ofGermany, then Germany will  be  defeated.   But unfortunately, in his  opinion,  thepeople of  this country do not sufficiently realise  the importance of Central Europeanproblems for the future  of the British Empire.     Germany&apos;s policy aims, above all, at the destruction  of the British Empire.  Shedoes not hope to accomplish this by defeating England at sea ; she intends to deal hermortal blow by land. She knows that if she succeeds in organising under her controlPoland, Austria-Hungary, the Balkans and Turkey that is to say, a territory having170 million inhabitants and stretching from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf and the Suez&apos;Canal there is no Power which could prevent her getting hold of the Suez Canal anddealing a mortal blow to EnglandJs power in Egypt and India.     The only way to prevent this  catastrophe is to destroy German  domination  in central Europe.   This  cannot be done  without destroying the Austro-HungarianEmpire and emancipating its nationalities, now forced against their will  to serve theGerman conqueror.     In Central Europe and the Balkans there are 80 million inhabitants,  belonging toeight different nationalities.   Part of them, the  Magyars and Bulgarians, alliedthemselves willingly with Germany, being chiefly afraid of Russia.  But the majorityare  the decided enemies of Germany and may be organised against her.     That  organisation cannot be done by Russia.   In this war Russia has provedunable to exercise any serious influence in Central  Europe and  in the Balkans.   Onthe contrary, her intolerance of the rights of nationalities has lost her a large amountof the prestige she  enjoyed among the Serbians and Greeks  before the war.  Herpolicy pushed the Bulgarians into the arms of Germany, and if she has not succeeded in doing the same with the Poles, it is  only thanks to  the inveterate  anti-Germanfeeling of the Polish  people.  To-day Russia is further than ever from playing a leading part in Central Europe and the Balkans and she has no chance whatever of reconqueringher position.  During the last period of her history she has been busy (since the establish-ment of the Duma) in consolidating the Empire as a centralised national Russian State,seeing that it is threatened by the  separatist tendencies  of its  heterogeneous popula-tion.   That is why she does not expect an extension of her influence in the West, andthat is why she does  not intend to  reunite Poland; indeed, sooner than give politicalautonomy  to  Poland, the Russian  Government would rather get rid  of the Polishterritories possessed by Russia before the war.     This  attitude  on the part of Russia is most  favourable to German  plans  andinspires Germany with the hope that  nobody  will  be  able to interfere with  herMittel  Europa plan.   It is evident that with Central Europe  (Austria-Hungary and poland) in her hands, the  Balkans and Turkey are bound to come under her control.Nobody will then be able  to  prevent her from building  strategic railways to  thePersian Gulf and the Suez Canal, from carrying as many guns and troops as necessaryfor  use against those vulnerable  points of the  British Empire,  and  from becoming a naval power in the Mediterranean.
    The only way of ruining the German plan is to call to life the anti-German forces to be found on the territory on which she intends to build her invincible power.  Theblow  to  that plan cannot be struck in the Balkans alone;  the  fatal blow must  be struck in Central Europe.   The reconstitution of united Poland, the  destruction ofAustria and the emancipation of her nationalities, among which the Czechs representa very powerful anti-German element,  can  alone save the Balkans and Turkey from german  conquest.    It must not be forgotten that the Poles  are not a minor nationality, but form oneOf the great nations of Europe, and that a Polish State, even if it were constituted  outof only half of the ancient Polish territories, provided that German  Poland with the mouth of the Vistula and Danzig were included in it, together with the rich coal-fields of Polish Silesia, would be a European Power.  And it might be still greater andstronger  in union with Bohemia, a plan not  impossible to realise.    Such a great revolution in the political  structure of Europe is only possible after a crushing defeat of Germany.   It would therefore require  a tremendous effort on thepart of the Allies, yet without this  effort nothing can prevent the realisation of  theGerman  plan, which threatens to be disastrous to the British Empire.    If such a solution of the Central European problem by the Allies  should be made their programme, if circumstances favour the proclamation of that  programme in somecrisis of the war,  it may be hoped that even  in  this war the national forces of central europe may play some part in accomplishing the final overthrow of Germany.    v                                                                            \    I have  heard Dr. Dmowski put  forward the opinions, recorded above, on a good many occasions and believe that I have faithfully reproduced his views.

ARABIA.                           Hejaz.                      Summary  of Neios.     There are  two outstanding items of  intelligence this week,which, perhaps,  are  not unconnected, arid  represent  cause  and effect.   The first is that Sidi Abdullah, on the 13th of the month,surprised  an armed convoy under the notorious Turkish bravo,Eshref  Bey  of  Salihli (see our No. 26, p. 361) somewhere nearKheibar.  It was carrying for Hail a large sum in specie, statedat L.T. 20,000, with letters.   The report  received  from Mecca-states that this specie, thirty-four men, a  mountain-gun, muchammunition  and  stores,  and many  camels and horses  were captured,  together  with,  presumably, Eshref himself.  after making this haul,  Abdullah  crossed  the railway   near  AbfolNairn,  and came into the Wadi Ais in order to co-operate withSidi Feisal, who was about  to march on Wejh.     The second item is that the &quot; reorganization of Turkish linesof communication,&quot; south-west of Medina, mentioned in our lastnumber, has turned out, as we then expected, to be a very consider-able measure of withdrawal on all the liabugh roads, as well as fromthe Yambo  direction.   All advanced posts at and  about Hamra,at Khafia and   Bir  Zeid, and at Hafah have been called in, andBir el-Raha  and  G-hayir (the last observed by our planes to bepartly  evacuated on the 21st and in the same state on the 25th)are the southernmost  positions.   We  have learned  in various ways that much material of all kinds  has been or is about to beretired to Medina, and there remains little  doubt that  Turkishoffensive movements towards Yambo and  Rabugh  are abandonedfor the present.     If this  is so, Sidi Abdullah&apos;s stroke,  which preceded  by two or three  days our first inkling  of Turkish withdrawal in thesouth-west, probably had  something to do  with it.    Added touneasiness about communications and shortage  of supplies, thereis also probably serious sickness in Medina.   Considering his smallstrength, one wonders  why the Turkish  Commanding  Officerever undertook these fruitless and abortive offensives.  It is justpossible they were intended  only  as  demonstrations, to  createpanic, and induce us  to land  troops in the  Holy Land, to theadvantage of the Turkish Sinai operations, and of pan-Islamicpropaganda  directed  from  Medina.  If  so,  we have  avoided avery pretty trap.          *          *         *         *         *     Later information  shows that the Turkish retirement  hasbeen arrested.   Though Bir Abbas has been evacuated, Ghayiris still held fairly strongly with  an outpost at Mijz which hasbeen engaged with  some success by  Sidi  Ali&apos;s  force.  Mean-while,  the arrival at Medina  from the  north, of  two, if  notthree battalions  of  the  131st  Regiment  is  confirmed.   The
 barracks  there near  the  Bab  Kubah (south gate) are reported damaged  by an explosion, caused by  Bisbawis of the Sherifial guard, who somehow penetrated the Turkish  lines.   Sidi Ali&apos;s main  force is  between   Rayana  and  Bir  el-Adhab  on  the Fura  road.     On  the  24th a fresh nail was hammered into the Turkish coffin by  the  capture of  Wejh.  The  garrison had, apparently, withdrawn  to a  ridge  behind  the  town,  on the previous day, where  it was engaged  by 600 Arabs transported from Yambo, who  had also some assistance  from us.  It was. finally  driven from the  ridge with a loss of twenty  killed and  wounded,  and, eighty captured,  and retired  inland, in the direction of El-Ala. Wejh itself is  now occupied by Sherifial  forces, and  will serve.- as a new  base for a combined attack by the armies of Feisal  and Abdullah on the railway, at or near El-Ala.                           Currency.     The present situation  in  regard to exchange and currencyappears peculiar to those unfamiliar with the complexities  aridvariations Of  currency values  in the Turkish Empire.  Henceit is that somewhat wild rumours have been spread about thata  British sovereign  may now be purchased for  ten  to fifteenpiastres silver.  In point of fact the exchange in  the  Hejaz hasbeen surprisingly stable taking all things into consideration  andcompares  very  favourably   with  the currency situation either in Persia or  Mesopotamia.     The  recognized  currency of the  Hejaz  is  of  course theTurkish  currency  consisting   of  the  Turkish  lira,  the  gold(or standard piastre) and the silver  piastre.  Confusion is oftenmade in  peoples  minds  as to the difference between  the  goldpiastre and the silver piastre.  This may be simply explained bythe statement that there is  no different  token  for the gold  and silver piastre.   The words  &quot; gold piastre &quot; are  used to express a standard value ; the silver piastre is the  piastre  valued at themai-ket  rates by the local  &quot; sarafs.&quot;         Thus the  Napoleon   =   90 gold piastres.                ,,   Lira        =  108   ,,                ,,   Sovereign.^  120   ,,   .  ,,                ,,   Rupee      =    8   ,,     ,,     From such values the silver piastre fluctuates.     Generally speaking  all  evidence points to there  being  ashortage- both of   gold, and silver  currency for  the  needs  ofthe Hejaz  at the  present  time, though  this  shortage is moreor less  apparent according  as  it is viewed  from different areas and  localities  in the Hejaz.  More than, this,  such currency as there is is very unevenly  spread in the country. .  .
     This shortage  of  currency is  due  to  the  fact  that  the currency  market  is largely cut off from  its source in Turkey entirely  cut off  from  silver, and only less so from gold import,in that a certain quantity of Turkish gold is  still  imported bythe Turks for bribing Arab tribes.   At first sight it would seemprobable, however, that as  much gold  and silver coinage mustexist in the country now, as.at the commencement of the revolt;but  this  is  not  the case,  for it is certain that more gold than usual has found its way out of the country.  The main revenue of the country in  normal times  is obtained from  the annualpilgrimage,  during which a  large  sum, in various, but chieflyIndian  coinage,  is  deposited  in  the  country.  This coinagere-exported to  India etc., practically pays for the  annual foreignimports of the country.   The failure of  the pilgrimage  since  thewar  has deprived the country of this revenue, and gold has hadto be exported. to pay  for the needs of  the  population theseneeds i.e., foreign imports have continued to be received, although in diminished  quantities, either via  the  sea  coast, or via  thePersian Gulf or the Nejd- and of the latter  there is  of  courseno record.     The foregoing remarks indicate fairly clearly the manner inwhich  a shortage has  come  about, and to them  may be addedanother  cause, namely, that  of hoarding,  a practice common inthe East, and one that becomes exaggerated in  times of militaryand political upheaval.     There remains only in  this particular connection  to remarkthat the importation of  British gold, which  has been regularduring the last twelve  months, does not balance the  increasedexport or lack  of supply from the north.     At the present time the value of the  sovereign has  depre-ciated up country and appreciated in Jiddah and Mecca.  Whilstisolated instances of a sovereign changing  hands in exchange forten piastres may  have occurred, such cases  are  not indicative ofany real  exchange value, because  they  are only  isolated trans-actions ; but  according to  information  available, the sovereignhas  depreciated  from  a value of  120 piastres  to seventy oreighty,  in  itself  no small fall.  In the towns,  however, 140piastres must be paid for a  sovereign, an appreciation of twentypiastres on the gold  standard.     The  explanation  of this state  of  things is fairly obvious.It is that the shortage of Turkish silver, political considerations,and also transport questions compel all payments  to the tribes tobe made in  gold.     Whereas, therefore, the tribes have more gold than usual, the towns have less, and the impossibility of getting more silver fromthe north frontier keeps the gold permanently  in the  hands ofthe tribes.   Nor do the tribes seek very much, or need to obtain,a silver equivalent, for both they and their families are  being fed
          Supposed Proclamation by the Imam Yahya.     The  Arabic text, of which the subjoined is a translation, isreported to have been circulating lately in Jiddah, and else wherein Hejaz.  It bears no date, and contains no  internal evidencesufficient to fix  it more precisely in time, than subsequent to theoperations against  Jiddah, in  June  last.   ISTor is  even  thisterminus a quo quite certain.   Generally it is very vague, and  itwill  be observed that it never explicitly mentions the Sherif.  Itis strange that it should be addressed to the Hejazis in particular,seeing how little the Imams of Yemen have ever had to do withHejaz, and stranger, that it should be addressed to them after theirrevolt  had begun.   Our  copy bears no seal.  It is quite possibly a Medina forgery, as it shows trace of Turkish authorship.  Adeninforms us that  it knows nothing of this Proclamation.     &quot;In the name of  God, the Merciful and Compassionate,from the  Imam  of  Yemen,  Yehia  Ibn  Mohammed  Hamidel-Din.&quot;     &quot; Oh, ye faithful !   Do not befriend the Jews or Christians,for he  who befriends them will  belong to them,  and God  willnot guide the oppressors.     &quot; This is our letter  to all  the  inhabitants of Hejaz ;  mayGod reform  their affairs  and lead them with us into the pathof His obedience, and may God protect us against  the  evils  ofthe soul  and  of  Satan.     &quot; Salaams be unto you, and the blessings of God.by  food  imported by  Great Britain  into Jiddah, Rabugh  andYambo, and distributed amongst the  tribesmen  by the Sherifssons and  their officers.     A  good  deal too  much has probably  been  made  of  the depreciation of the sovereign up country.   This  would only be serious  if transactions  on  any  considerable scale were taking-place.   Were this so, more evidence  of gold collection in Yambowould be  to hand, but so far no such evidence exists.     It is  obviously desirable that hot  only should facilities  forthe freer  movement  of  silver  exist, but that  silver should be imported  instead of gold for a time.     Suggestions to this effect have been made  to  the Sherifmore than once, but for  the moment he is not inclined to accept this  suggestion.     In  a  month or two, when the military tension will, as it ishoped, be lessened, the necessary measures can be taken, and theSherif is likely to meet us.in the matter.

    &quot; There is no one who has not  heard of. what  the  BritishGovernment has done how they have acted aggressively  againstthe port of Jiddah,  shelled our brethren, spread their warshipsthroughout the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, and bombarded the moslem places on the coasts.  They have done so  out of prideand haughtiness over our Moslem brethren.  Their only object which, pray  God, they will never attain is to commit crimesupon and  persecute those who solely worship the only God.  Wehave heard that what led them to take this bold step was theirenticement of one  who has sold his religion for his worldlybenefit-one  of  the inhabitants of this country on whom theybestow  worldly  gifts as  well  as their menaces to differentpeople showing  them  that they are powerful enough  to takerevenge if they do not acqueise in their  wishes.    &quot; Those who have a disease in their  hearts are always heardto say : &apos;  We are afraid, lest evil befall us.&apos;  May God grant usvictory, or do something to them that will make them repenttheir deeds.     &quot; They  (the British) have gone so far as to  open gun-fire from the sea  on  some Islamic places on the coast of our country,the Yemen, because they-were indignant about our alliance withthe Ottoman  Government.&apos;  They may have imagined that theirmenaces and  threats would lead the Yemen people  to desert theirreligion submissively ;  but 0 1  how far this is from us !  TheProphet said  : &apos;  0 ye who have believed, if any one among  youdeserts his religion, God will  abase him before those whom  Heloves and  who love Him, and He will elevate the faithful abovethe infidels ;  the faithful will fight in  the cause of God, fearingno reproach.   This is the blessing of God which He bestows upon those whom  He chooses,  for God&apos;s  knowledge  is great  and extensive.&apos;     &quot; This calamity has befallen the Yemen people the peopleof whom  the Prophet  of  God said : &apos; Faith  is Yemenite,  andwisdom also  belongs  to  Yemen.&apos;    Then  God inspired  thefollowing  verses in  His  book that book which cannot  containanything false :  &apos; Your  only masters are God  and  His Prophet.The faithful, those who  prostrate  themselves while praying,those who offer their belongings  (zekat), sacrifice to God,  andthose who befriend God and His Prophet,  are the victoriousparty of God.  O ye who have  believed,  do  not prefer thosewho mock your religion and use it as a  plaything,  to  those whoobserve the dictates of the Book.  Fear God if  you are trulyfaithful.&apos;     &quot; Let those  who read this know that this tyrannous party is of a religious sect, which God has warned us not  to befriend.He who befriends them will belong to them.   A person is either a declared  infidel or a true Moslem.  The alliance of the TurkishGovernment  with  the  Germans  is  against  our enemies, theEnglish, French, Russians  and  Italians, and not  against  ourMoslem brethren.   These are our enemies who have  expelled us
from our homes,  to  which  act history is  witness.  God said :&apos; God does not forbid you from fighting those who fight yourreligion.   He did not want you to be expelled from your homes.He forbids you to fight those who fight  them.&apos;   Look  at what happens in Egypt, the Sudan and India, under the infidel british flag, also look at the doings of the French in Algeria, and of theRussians in the  Caucasus, and  at the great crime which  theItalians have committed only yesterday upon the Senussists inTripoli.  Then rise for the &apos; jehad &apos; which is  a duty  to  allMoslems, and one for which  they should offer  their lives  and money.  &apos; God has bought your lives and possessions, and givenyou paradise instead, so you should fight, kill and be  killed inHis cause.   This  is the solemn promise which He made  in theBible, the Scriptures, and  the Koran, and who can be more true to His promise than  Almighty God ?  Then be of good  cheer,as this bargain means a great victory to you.&apos; .    &quot; Their lost souls and there false hopes may have deceivedthem into stretching a hostile hand against  these sacred places.If they have done so, then it is imperative  on every Moslem tofight the &apos; jehad,&apos; and gain  eternal life.   We hereby call uponyou to fight the &apos; jehad,&apos; and desert  those  who have befriendedthem, so that God and His Prophet may be pleased with you.Fight with a firm determination, and with hearts imbued withobedience to God, so that  the  word of God  may  be lifted up,and your souls unaffected by any worldly object, and so thatthose who  die may gain paradise,  and  those who  return maybring with them the legitimate spoils of war as well as happiness.    &quot; Then  get ready for  the &apos; jehad,&apos;  and  let your  preparation for it be  complete, and await the  first move on our part;    &quot; Be of good cheer for God is with you and will not desertyou.   He  says :    &apos; We  have stated in. the Psalms  that ourrighteous worshippers  will  inherit  the  earth.   This  is  ourmessage to the pious.  0  ye who have  believed,  fear God andbe sincere.&apos;    &quot; God is our  best support and helper, praise be to Him, andthe greetings and blessings of God be upon you.&quot;
LIBYA.                      Present Situation.     Seyyid Mohammed Idris has communicated with the  HighCommissioner of Egypt and the Italian Government that  he is ready  to resume  negotiations, and the  Italian  and  BritishCommissioners are now at, or on the way to, Tobruk.     Mohammed Idris has sent in a copy of a letter from SeyyidAhmed el-Senussi to himself,  urging  him to  come  to  a tem-porary agreement with  the British, so as  to give him  (SeyyidAhmed) time  to  resume  hostilities.   He also alluded  in  theletter to the Firman from the Sultan appointing him his &quot; Wakil &quot;in Africa, which honour has greatly gratified  his vanity, sincethe appointment of Suleiman el-Baruni to  the Governorship of&quot; Tripoli  and  its  dependencies &quot;  had  encroached on  whatSeyyid   Ahmed  considered to  be  his sphere  of influence.The letter has given positive proof of his  bad faith  towards us, but it confirms the belief formed by native  opinion that  he cannot  withstand  pressure from  Mohammed  Idris,  whom  headdresses as &quot; master,&quot;  and whose  commands  he  expresses  his willingness and intention to obey.     Mohammed  Idris&apos;s  intentions towards  us  have  alwaysappeared genuine, and the fact  that he has spontaneously sent ina  letter of this nature  further confirms us in the  opinion wehad formed of his good faith.     Seyyid Ahmed&apos;s withdrawal from   Siwa  appears imminent,and his ultimate destination would  seem to be  Kufra, since  hehas informed Mohammed Idris  that he  cannot  stay at Jaghbub.It is known that supplies are very short, and would  have  to  beobtained from Siwa;  therefore,  he  would  be in  danger  ofstarvation if, and when  that Oasis was  reoccupied by us.     [Jaghbub, to judge by accounts of natives recently returned from there, would be unable to support even  a  small body  o followers in the present conditions of restricted trade.]    The Italian victory at Zuara will have a steadying effect onthe policy of Baruni,  whose mission was to unite the  variousdiscordant elements in Tripoli  against the common enemy.    It does not appear  that he has had a remarkably favourable reception, and it is almost certain that he  will not  get anySenussi support.  By working in with  Ramadan el-Shetewi andNuri he has deliberately set himself up against Seyyid MohammedIdris, Seyyid  Safi el-Din, and Seyyid Ahmed.  He has  madeAzizia, south of Tripoli, the headquarters of his administration.To what extent he was responsible for the  ill-advised  attackon Zuara is not yet  clear, and  it  is  possible that it  was  thespontaneous effort of the victors of Yeffren.    The fact,  however,  must not  be lost  sight  of that  theTurkish Governments main pre-occupation is the embarrassmentof Italy  in  Tripoli, as it  used to  be the em harassment of the
British  in  Egypt, and that, provided  sufficient troops are keptengaged with the enemy in any zone,  the object of the Turks is fully attained.  It is from no altruistic motives that  the natives of Tripoli are fed on lavish promises of help and periodic crumbsof material assistance in  the  shape of rifles and officers  landedfrom submarines.                       ABYSSINIA.                      Present Situation.     It  has previously been stated  that the Shoan Governmentwas very doubtful about the attitude of Ras Waldo Giorgis, but until now the grounds of its suspicion were unknown to us.   Itseems  that the early  negotiations  with the  Ras resulted in his acceptance   of  the new  regime,  subject,  however^  to  certain conditions  and  promises, which  remain secret.   It appears thathe aspired  to the reversion of the whole of  the Negus MikhaiPsdominions.  As this  would mean that the Negus of the Northwould become more powerful than the Empress herself, and thatAdis Abeba would be dominated by Dessie, a claim of this kindwas clearly inadmissable.  Instead, however, of clearly refusingit, it is believed that Ras Taffari, in his usual temporising style,prevaricated about the  matter, with the idea of securing  WaldoGiorgis&apos;  assistance during the trouble, and evading payment for it .afterwards.   Waldo  Giorgis  now  claims  that promises havebeen broken by the appointment, without consulting him, of RasWolye  to  Yejju (incorrectly given in the last bulletin as Edgu)and last, which constitute a large portion of  Mikhaifs formerkingdom.  After  the  early negotiations, Ras Demissie was sent from Adis Abeba to occupy Dessie, but before his arrival WaldoGiorgis had moved down and occupied it himself.   Demissie,therefore,  proceeded  with further operations against  Lij  Yasuand the forces of Ras Imer of Wollo, which resulted in the defeat of  the latter at Tanta on December 28, Lij  Yasu  himself havingescaped again to the Danakil country two days before  the  fight.In these operations,  Ras Waldo  Giorgis,  dissatisfied  with  the march of events, gave no assistance, and. although  the strugglebetween  Shoa and  Wollo may be considered as  terminated,  therelations as between Shoa and himself are  by no  means  settled,and it is possible that a contest may arise for supremacy between him and  Ras  Taffari.   The unwillingness,  however,  of  theAbyssinians to incur the evils resulting from a  continuance ofcivil war, and the uncertainty  of the line  which the provinceswould take in  the event of  an open breach, render this issueimprobable.  An exchange of the overlordship of Waldo Giorgisfor that of Mikhail would be unwelcome in many quarters.  RasSeyyum of Tigre  has already  refused  to  obey  Waldo Giorgis&apos;
summons to present himself at Dessie, on the plea that he wasunder  the direct control of  the  central Government, and it isreported that the ruler of  Simyen  has collected  an army  Of8,000 men and  is practically in revolt against Waldo  Giorgis onaccount of some personal grievance.  Meanwhile, Waldo  Giorgisremains at Dessie, and is practically looting  Wollo  on his own account, and sending  herds of  cattle  and large amounts  ofsupplies to his own country,  while Taffari is  evidently afraid  of him,  and, through   weakness,  dares not  oppose  any  of  hispretensions, however much  he  may disapprove of them.     Probably because he does not wish any  foreign,  witness  ofhis acts, Waldo Giorgis has taken objection to the presence of theItalian  agent  at Dessie, and  Taffari,  while  recognizing  theunjustifiability  of Waldo  Giorgis&apos;  demand, has  suggested  to count  Colli, the Italian minister, that, in order  to save trouble,he might call the Italian agent to Adis Abeba another example of his hopelessly invertebrate character.   Although the paymentof his  full  price to  Waldo  Giorgis  would be very damaging toTaffari&apos;s prestige, it  is  possible that the  latter may give way,consoling himself with the  thought that Waldo Giorgis is wellon in years, and that consequently the arrangement  would  notbe for  long.     The  Abyssinian  Government  has notified  us that  the coronation  of  the  Empress  Zauditu  will   take   place  onFebruary 11, and has asked  that  special representatives  shouldbe sent for the occasion.  It  has  been decided  that the  british minister at Adis Abeba should be specially accredited to representthe  British  Government, and  that Major  Pearson,  now  inJiddah,  should  proceed  to   Abyssinia  immediately   as  repre-sentative of the  Sudan  Government.                          NOTES.The Sheikhs of Muhammerah and Kuweit to the Sherif.     A copy of the letter, of which the following is a translation,has been sent to Sir Percy Cox with a covering despatch in whichthe Sheikhs state that it is a reply to a message of congratulationupon the Kuweit Durbar (see our No. 38, p. 15) transmitted bythe Sherif through H.M. High Commissioner at Cairo :      &quot; To the possessor of  the  excellent  attributes  and qualities,the possessor of dignity and greatness, our lord, lord of all, the highly esteemed father, the Sherif Hussein, son of the late SherifAli, the glorified,  may his grandeur perpetuate.
     &quot; After offering our  high respects to your high position, webeg  to say that with great  pleasure and  gladness  we perusedyour friendly and fatherly message with  which you  were kindenough to favour us through  His Excellency the Representativeof Great Britain in Cairo and which contained the expression ofyour pleasure  and  hearty  congratulations for  our  meetingconvened in Kuweit  and that of  His  Honour  the Amir Azizibn  Saud.   We most respectfully Offer to your Pure Lordship(Siadatokum al Tahirah) our best thanks and extreme grateful -ness and we pray God to uphold your grandeur and to perpetuateyour honour and to extend to you His eternal help.  Know you,0 Our Lord, that our real object in  this meeting is to  strengthen the cause of the  Arab -nation  and  the  Islamic religion  andadherence to your  Holy Lordship  and the  High Governmentof Great Britain, and we hope that this friendly  meeting maybe crowned with honour, success and prosperity.  It is, therefore,incumbent upon us to show candour in this auspicious deed andall  those who  have zeal for the  Arab nation will  no  doubt be pleased  and grateful for  that  and will follow our  policy by way of guidance, and whoever goes astray there is no guidefor him.     &quot; Your  Lordship wrote  that,  had you known  about our meeting  beforehand,  you would have  honoured it by sending a  representative to  attend  on  your behalf.  You may  know0 Our Lord, had God decreed that,  it would  have  been greatblessing  and pleasure for us.   We  too,  however,  ate  in  alleventualities to be reckoned of your following.  We beseech Godthat all  your good actions may be  crowned with honour  andsuccess, and that we may have the  good fortune  to  earn yourpleasure  and your hearty satisfaction.&quot;                  (Signed) :  Khazal bin Jabar al  Mardao.

December  8.   Further news has  been  received regardingfighting between Turkish troops and tribesmen at Hillah.   Strongrumours are current, on  this subject in Ali Gharbi and an agentwho left Hillah on November 18, reports at  Basra  that  AkifBey&apos;s force entered Hillah  on November  10, having  arrivedat  Museyib in shakhturs  at  the end of  October.   This agentstates that the entry of  the troops into the town was resisted bythe inhabitants, the losses  of the latter being heavy.   Townresidents with  the exception of  some 450  Sunnis  are statedto have left Hillah and  to be living with the  tribes.  As regardsthe execution of notables this man states that fourteen  leading
men  were hanged &quot;by the  Turks.   He  alleges that the force at  Hillah  is  practically surrounded by  hostile tribesmen andtownspeople.  This allegation seems to indicate that the  Turkishforce is not large in reality though the agent puts it at the highfigure of eight battalions.     A.P.O.  Zubeir  telegraphs on  December  5,  that inquiriesshow the  messenger of Ibn Rashid,  who was previously falselyreported as bearing a letter to the C.P.O., was really an emissarysent to the chiefs of the Aslam section to induce them to returnto Ibn Rashid.Unrest in  Yemen.     Under date January 20, Aden sends us  various  reports  of varying credibility relating  to  the  condition of Yemen.   two matters concerned have been noticed by us  before.   First :  the expedition of the Imam&apos;s son  southward, following  an  allegedquarrel with  his father.  A long account has  been given by aman from  Zebid one  Mohammed  Ali Hiba el-Mekki to  theeffect  that  the son   in  question,  whom   he  calls  Ahmedel-Mutawakkil Alia Allah &quot;el-Mumahid&quot; did raise  the Hashid,Bekil, Hamdan and Beni Matar against the Turks by recountingthe iniquities of the latter at Mecca and elsewhere,  and working on the tribesmen^ discontent about the stoppage  of trade withAden.  He marched down to the Beni Matar country, (i.e. theridge between Mefhak and  Waalan), and  caused panic at Sanaa.The citizens  sent various presents of cattle to him, and he appearsto have contented himself with  these and with denunciations ofthe Turks, and to have gone back to his father, with whom he issaid  now  to  be reconciled.   Sanaa is   reported by the sameinformant  to be in a state of great  distress and  insecurity,  theVali  having  no longer any real  power,  and the garrison beinghalf starved.   There is only one battalion there, but four are atShehara, and the Imam refuses to let them go to Ali Said Pasha.This  informant adds,  that when the Imam&apos;s son was threateningSanaa, his  father, at the request of the citizens, sent 1,500 tribes-men  to protect  the  place.    This  may  explain   the  son&apos;withdrawal,  but it makes the stoiw of  the  quarrel  and recon-ciliation more obscure than ever.     The second matter is reported  on by the Mutawif  SeyyidYahya (see our Nos. 37, 38, pp. 6, 22).  Idrisi is said to have laidbefore the  Hashid chiefs the  heads of his proposed  division  ofYemen.  Practically he claimed all the Tihamah, and also (unless there is some clerical error) the district of Yerim.   The Hashiclchiefs, not unnaturally, discouraged his expectation that the Imamwould consider  such  terms, and blandly pointed out, that  thebest way   to  bring  him to reason  was  to subsidize and armthemselves (the  Hashid), so that  they might  bring  pressure  tobear.     A new matter, perhaps connected with the first,  is  a row,ending  in  a  fight, between the Sheikh  of  Amran, Nizam ibnAbdullah, and the Vali of Yemen, over some prisoners (probably
tribal hostages) detained in the town prison by the Imam&apos;s deputy,whom the Sheikh insisted on setting free.  The latter called firston the Hashid and then on Idrisi for help,  but with  what  result is not told.     Imam and  Turks appear as allies, against a rebellion of theAhl  el-Hada (who are these ? Bekil ?) at the  end  of December.The  trouble arose from the Imam&apos;s exactions.     Finally  a  very  surprising  report reached  the MutawifYahya, via, apparently,  Idrisi, that a large force of  Ibn Saud&apos;speople had come into the eastern oases and occupied part o   theBarat country, south of Nejran, and east of the  Bekil  pastures.We wait confirmation of this.Deutsch-Tiirkische Vereinigung.     This Society has been formed to  send German  teachers to turkey ;  establish libraries and  schools ;  circulate tendentiousliterature ; and help Turks to finish their education in Germany.It has a  school at Adana, and helps other German  schools atConstantinople, Aleppo, Baghdad, Jerusalem,  etc.  Moreover, ithas  secured  the introduction of a  German course and Germaninstructors  into  Turkish  schools.     One  of  its  committee,stanhope. Regierungsrat  Professor   Doctor  Franz   Schmidt,  isAdviser to the Ministry of Education.   In Germany itself, theSociety labours to promote a &quot; better understanding &quot; of Turkey.It proposes  further  to  establish  German clinical and hospitalfoundations in Turkey, but not till after the war.  corresponding to it in Turkey is the Tiirkisch-Deutsche Vereinigung, under the presidency of Enver.

APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT, No. VII.                              RUSSIA  AND RUMANIA,...   AS the Russian and Rumanian situations are still obscure, the telegrams relatingthereto are reserved for  the  next report, by the time of issue of which it is hoped acomplete account may be given of  both.                          THE OCCUPATION OF BAGHDAD.    The occupation of Baghdad is of course an event of great military, political, andhistorical importance.    To the Turks Baghdad has always been one of their great spoils of conquest, andits loss will be bitterly resented, more so perhaps than that of Erzerum.   Combined withthe loss of Mecca it  will tend  to aive the old school  of Turks a feeling  that thesemisfortunes are  a divine  chastisement for the crimes of the Committee of  Union and progress.                                                         &apos;    In Germany we must expect that the constant booming of the  Baghdad-Bahnwill now  react  in  an  equivalent  depression  of  spirits.  As Messrs.  Rohrbach  and company have incessantly explained  that Baghdad is  only second  in importance to constantinople there cannot fail to be a strong feeling of  disgust at the event.    It is to be expected  that  in India  the fact that Indian troops  have largely con-tributed to this conquest will have a good effect.    In Persia we have an  opportunity of earning some popularity ;  Baghdad is thecentre of manj- Shia shrines, so by offering special facilities for pilgrimage, transit ofgifts and custodianship of shrines we have a  chance of making our  peace with theShia section  of  Islam, which has  been  beyond the reach of our propaganda and hasdeeply resented various acts of  the Russians in  Meshed and elsewhere.    On the Arabs  as  a  whole the event will  be slow  to take effect  but  will, whenappreciated, be  very far-reaching in the end.  The Arabs,  being  very pawky  andcautious, will at first wait and see whether we  are firmly established; when this isclear we shall be in a position of very great political advantage.  We  should at onceopen up relations with J6f, Jebel Druse, and the Arabs of the Shamiyeh desert.  Thisis a matter of the very greatest urgency.   Representatives of all the  tribes should be encouraged to come in ;  Chiefs like Nuri  Sha&apos;alan should, if possible,Ibe persuaded to appoint Wakils  accredited to Sir Percy Cox ; and a system of regular posts shouldbe established between Baghdad and the various tribal headquarters.    On  the  Kurds of the Sulaimania  district the fall of Baghdad should have  con-siderable influence.   They are within our sphere of interest according to agreement; theyare naturally anti-Turk, but Russophobia keeps them against us ; if we could by any means win them over, they would be a tremendous asset.  Treacherous and  wild  as allKurds are,  they are exceedingly intelligent and have exceptional initiative.   Theydepend for commodities on Baghdad and are normally Anglophil.  This should be a good opportunity if we have officers acquainted with their mentality.    The Arab intellectuals will look with great expectation to our policy in Baghdad ;it  would  be  politic to give some  of  them employment -in fairly high executive  civilpositions in the neighbourhood of Baghdad.
