                                     RUSSIA.     REPORTS  from  various  sources  in  Russia  are  anything  but  encouraging.M. Kerensky&apos;s  triumphal  tour  cannot be regarded  as being likely to have  any verylasting effect.   The vast mass of  the  proletariat are thinking not about the war butabout the division of  land,  higher wages, and shorter  hours  of labour.   Industrialtrouble  is  general,  and   if  the  Provisional  Government are  unable  to assert  their authority in Kronstadt, how  can they be expected to have any real control  elsewhere?At any rate the situation is one of extreme instability, and  neither  generals  norministers can look forward to any term of ofice with  assurance.     It would seem  useless for  the  Allies to  whittle down  their just and reasonableaspirations in order to accommodate their policy to that of the Russian extremists.     M.  Terestchenko&apos;s optimism seems to be still maintained, and no one can doubt hisgood intentions.  It is difficult, however, to see the grounds upon which his optimismis based.                                    ARABIA.     The difficulties  with the French regarding the Hejaz seem to have reached  some-thing like a deadlock.  Sir Mark Sykes is returning to England, while M. Picot remains in Egypt.     One&apos;s hope regarding the  Arab  confederacy  against the Imam and his  Turkishsupporters is at an  end.   Colonel Jacobs recommendations against  supporting theconfederacy removes  tbe last ground upon  which such hope was  based.     Ibn  Rashid is  a  wretched representative of a  now wretched dynasty,  and hisadherence is a doubtful asset.  Nevertheless, the possible reversion of Hail is a goldenapple of discord between  N^uri  Shalaan,  Ibn  Saud,  and  King Hussein, arid it  may therefore be  desirable to save the Sharnmar Emirate from extinction.

Sir  G.  Buchanantelegraphed on the  29th May [No.  790] that M. Terestchenko did not quite like  thesubstitution of &quot; unite&quot; for &quot; restore,&quot; but had  accepted it.   On the following  day hetelegraphed again  [No. 795]  saying that M.  Terestchenko  had asked  for a furthermodification of the note, as, after&apos;serious reflection, he had come to the conclusion thatthe passages about  the Arabs and the German  colonies would give  rise to dangerousdiscussions.  The essential thing at the present  moment was to  keep the army out of politics, and he feared that if a  heated discussion  arose over  Mesopotamia and  theGerman colonies, emissaries might be sent to the front to tell the army not to fight forBritish imperialistic aims.   It  would, he thought, be better  to express the  sentimentsconveyed in the note in more general terms, not citing  special cases.  On the groundthat it was advisable to  avoid  provoking discussion,  Sir G. Buchanan supported  the suggested.modification.  Lord Robert Cecil, in reply, said [No. 1133] that if the RussianGovernment wished  to  omit the  passage  indicated,  it would be better to make  nosubstitution, as, though  this would make  the  note  meaningless, it would not hamperour  future  action.   There  was, he said, as much opportunity  for criticism in  vaguegeneralities as in definite statements, and, in view  of the visit  of Socialist  delegates,there was some advantage in stating  clearly what we reaUy  did intend.   He  should himself prefer to leave the note as it stood, unless Sir G. Buchanan and M. Terestehenkofelt strongly on the point.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed  on the 4th June [No.  830] that M. Terestchenko  sostrongly  objected to the publication of the note  as it stood, that  he would prefer not to publish it  unless&apos;&quot;the omissions suggested by  him were agreed  to.   Sir G. Buehananhad  discussed  the matter with Mr. Henderson  and  M. Thomas,  and  they, like himself,.were strongly in favour of the omission of the passages  to which M.  Terestchenko hadtaken exception.   He trusted, therefore,  that lie  might  be  at once authorised  to substitute a new note.[898-46]B
     Kronstadt On the 8th June  Sir G. Buchanan transmitted a telegram [No. 808] from the military attache reporting that the Workmen&apos;s  Council in  Kronstadt, by a majority of 210 against 40 (with 8 abstentions), bad resolved that it did not recognise the  Provisional Government, and  would take  the management of Kronstadt into its own hands.  be presentatives of the Kronstadt Council were to replace all the represen- tatives of the Government, and business with the rest  of Russia was to be carried on through the Petrograd workmen&apos;s Council.     The Army. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 833]  on the 4th June that he had been informed by M. Terestchenko  that  General Brousiloff had been appointed  com- mander-in-chief in place of General  Alexieff, who had  resigned on account of ill-health. General Alexieff would be acting military adviser to the Government.     M. Kerensky at Odessa. Sir G. Buchanan transmitted on the 30th May  [No. 792] a telegram from the consul-general at  Odessa, who said that M. Kerensky had  had a tremendous reception from enormous crowds on his arrival at  Odessa on the 28th May. He addressed three packed meetings, at each of which the consuls of the allied nations were present.   He  was firm and decided in  what he said in regard to discipline, and to the  necessity of              the  war  and uniting  all  parties.   His remarks  were enthusiastically applauded;  and when a soldier deputy said that they were ready to take the offensive when ordered, the audience unanimously shouted assent.     The Navy. Sir G. Buchanan, on the 29th May, transmitted [No. 7 91]  a telegram from the naval attache, saying that the central Black Sea Men&apos;s Committee had wished to remove and arrest  the  assistant commandant of the Sebastopol fortress ; to  this Admiral Kolchak, the commander-in-chief of the Black Sea, would not agree, and,  as the committee stood  firm,  he had resigned.   This was justly regarded as a heavy blow to the Black Sea fleet, and  M. Kerensky  was  going from Odessa to Sebastopol to  try to arrange matters.   Sir  G. Buchanan  telegraphed  on the  5th June  [No. 835]  that the consul at  Heisingfors had reported  that the conditions of  the Russian fleet had much improved  during the last fortnight, and were still improving.     M. Chernoff and the Press. Sir  G.  Buchanan telegraphed  on the 30th May [No.  796] that he  had spoken to M. Terestchenko on the report of a speech made by M. Chernoff to a  delegation from the front in which he (M. Chernoff)  was made  to say that  victory would  be war  without end  and that to the calls to advance  made  by civilians in the press the army should reply &quot; enough.&quot;  He telegraphed again on the following day  [No. 803] that M. &quot;Terestchenko had  informed him that M. Chernoff had assured his colleagues that the press had published an absolutely incorrect version  of his speech.  He had really said that it was for the commander-in-chief and his colleagues to decide when the offensive  was  to take place and not  for irresponsible  civilians who were  clamouring in  the press  for  an offensive at some early date.   This explanation had fully satisfied Prince Lvov and M. Terestchenko and they considered the incident closed.     M. Konovaloff. Sir  G.  Buchanan  telegraphed on  the 1st  June [No. 811] that M. Terestchenko had informed him and  Mr. Henderson that M. Konovaloff,  Minister ofCommerce, had tendered his resignation, from which M. Terestchenko did not anticipate any serious consequences.     ? A Dictator. Sir G. Buchanan on the -30th May  transmitted [No. 793] a message from the naval attache to the  effect that talk about the  desirability of the appearance of a dictator,  to  consolidate  power and  bring order,  was being heard in  Petrograd,and Admiral Kolchak [See above under &quot; Navy &quot;] had been mentioned as fit for the post on account  of his  resolute character,  energy,  and undoubted  patriotism.   His  flag captain had arrived in Petrograd on the 26th May, and on the following day had called onthe naval  attache, who gathered  that  already a section  of naval officers leant in  this direction and that there had  been  discussions among the staff and senior officers of the Black Sea fleet, and that Admiral Kolchak had been present on at least one  occasion.The ostensible pretext  for Captain  Zarin&apos;s visit was to ask  whether facilities  might begiven to bring the Russian division from France as being more reliable tor the execution ofa coup d&apos;etat;  the idea being  that  it only required the existence of a small determinednucleus to gather together the wavering elements in the  army and  the fleet.   The
 little that was sketched appeared &apos; too extravagant to be likely to develop into  definitefaction, but it had some interest in connection  with the feeling of insecurity  rapidly growing in the propertied class.     Proposed Agreement as to Military Service. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 29th May [No. 789] that M. Terestchenko had sent  him a note, dated the  28th May, of which the following was a translation : The Provisional Government of Russia, in its desire to come to a solution of the question of the call to arms of Russian citizens living in Great Britain  and of British subjects living in Bussia, had decided to propose to the Government of His Britannic Majesty the conclusion of an agreement on this subject, of which the following is a draft:      &quot; The Provisional Government of Russia and  the  Government  of His Britannic Majesty have agreed to the following :      &quot; (1.) The Provisioned Government and the British Government will reciprocally bid their subjects inhabiting respectively Great  Britain and Russia, and belonging to the categories called  to the colours in  their own country to return to their respective countries.   (2.) The British  Government will undertake  as  far as  possible to effect during the summer of 1 917 transport by sea of the above-mentioned persons.  (3.)  Such of these persons as may  refuse to return  to their own  country, either  at their own expense or by profiting by the means set forth in No. 2 of  the  present agreement, will be compelled to undertake  military service in the country of their residence.  The call of these persons to arms will be effected  by authorities of the country of their residence, who will for this purpose apply the dispositions in force in  their respective countries as regards  absentees.   (4.) Persons who show  documents from their national authorities certifying their exemption from  military service will he exempt from the obligation to the call  to arms set forth in preceding article.&quot;     The note asked for a  reply as  early as  possible, and concluded,  by stating that  in the event  of His  Majesty&apos;s Government accepting  the Russian draft note, the above note and the signifying  by Sir  George Buchanan of the acceptance  of His Majesty&apos;s Government would be sufficient to  conclude  the agreement, which would be considered as operative from the date of Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s note.     [For  the  draft agreement  proposed  by His Majesty&apos;s  Government, see  Eastern Report XIII, p. 1.]     The Jews and Lord B. Cecil. The consul-general at  Odessa telegraphed on the 31st May  [No. 53 A.] that the &quot; Odessa Novosti,&quot; a newspaper entirely in Jewish hands, had made the reply given by Lord R, Cecil to a  question in the House of Commons concerning the Rumanian Jews an excuse  for a  violent  anti-English article, which, among other things, attacked our so-called imperialistic policy, and asked why England intervened in Turkey on the Armenian question but shamelessly and  haughtily refused to intervene in Rumania.   A comparison  was made between Lord R. cecils reply and that given to a similar  question  by the Russian Foreign Minister, the comparison being unfavourable to the former.     Propaganda. In  reply to  Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s  telegram of the 27th  May [Eastern Report XVIII, p. 4], Lord  R. Cecil telegraphed on the  5th  June [No.  1155] to say that an additional expenditure  of 10,000/, had been sanctioned.     Economic Crisis. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 31st May [No. 802] that he feared serious consequences not only in Petrograd but  in other  districts from  the economic  crisis.   The  owners of mills,  &amp;c, were  determined to make  a firm  stand against  further demands for increased wages, though they  had declared their  readiness to renounce al)  profits for the current year.   On the following day he transmitted a telegram [No. 808] from the military attache&quot;, who said that the struggle between capital and labour was rapidly coming to  a head.  Strikes  had already started in Petrograd on a small  scale;  a  rise of 100 per cent, in wages was demanded with arrears at  this rate for twenty-eight  months.   Force, he said,  was the only thing which would bring the workmen  to  their senses, and he did not know whether the Government was prepared to resort  to this  extreme measure ; the only force which could be relied on were the Cossacks reports were daily received  as to anarchy in  the interior, and often  the offenders  were armed soldiers.        [898-46]                                                        B  2
    Proposed Siberian Railway. Sir G. Buchana,n, in a despatch [No. 130, Commercial]dated the  24th April, forwarded a report  by the commercial attache to the PetrogradEmbassy on M. yon Taysen&apos;s scheme  for a  railway from  Obdorsk on  the Obi  to theArctic Ocean.  Mr. Cooke said that for present practical purposes, under existing con-ditions, the scheme had no chance of realisation.  All northern railway projects, he said,had been put aside for the present;  till the end of the war and for some time after, itwas most unlikely that any such projects, apart from urgent war necessities, would beconsidered at all.                                    POLAND.    Poles  in  the  Russian Army. Sir  G, Buchanan  telegraphed  on the  29th May[No. 787] that the military attache had  reported, in regard to the Polish situation, asfollows : The  Polish contingent had served in tbe Bussian army for two years and had lately been expanded into a division said to  be 30,000  strong.  The  press bad  statedthat there were 110 generals, 20,000 other officers, and 500,000 of Polish nationalityserving in the Russian units.   These figures were greatly exaggerated, but there were probably 200,000.   The  Poles were  anxious to concentrate in  units under their ownofficers, and it w ould be entirely in our interests that they should do so, for we  shouldbe able to depend on them to fight.   M.  Kerensky had  told him that he would  oppose this with  all  his  power, first, because the Poles  were not advanced  Socialists, and,secondly, because it would disorganise the Bussian army.  He pointed out  that the little russians, too,  wished  to  form a separate  army,  and that  he had cancelledM. Guchow&apos;s permission to the  Esthonians to  form national units.   The fact  was, themilitary attache said, the Russians realised that 200,000 Poles might conquer  russians things were at present.                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.    France and England. Sir R.  Wingate telegraphed on  the 3rd June [No. 583]that he thought that a  formal recognition of our  predominant position  by the FrenchGovernment  must be  insisted  on  for the following  reasons :  (1)  clause  2  of theSykes-Picot Agreement, in which our  special position vis-d-vis  the Arab  movement is recognised ; (2) the predilection openly expressed for us by King Hussein and the factthat it was only by our  intermediary that he had been brought into relations with theFrench ; (3) our inception of the Arab movement for independence, the whole burden ofwhich, both financial and military, had been borne by the British Government; (4) the geographical  situation  of Hejaz on the  road to the Persian Gulf and  India ;  (5) our treaty arrangements with various Arabian chiefs.YEMEN.    The Arab Confederacy. After telegraphing, on the 25th May, permission for the resident at Aden to proceed  as  he  had proposed [Eastern  Report  XVIII,  p.  7],Mr. Chamberlain  telegraphed again on the  same day to  the  Viceroy that, pending further instructions, no  action should be taken.  Next day, telegraphing again to theViceroy, he said that the scheme was regarded  as  unsound  by Colonel Jacob, who had seen all the telegrams.   From some of the names he suspected that it was engineeredby Idrisi to get rid of the Imam and establish  his own claims in Yemen ;  in any case,he was  not satisfied  that the confederacy was primarily anti-Turk.  He doubted its success, and considered  that in case of failure our reputation for good  faith would be destroyed  and our best potential friends in Yemen estranged.  Colonel Jacob hadobserved that we could not control the confederacy ; he thought that some of the Arabsupporters  were men of straw; and he considered that to leave an Arab rival to Idrisiwould be the wisest policy.   Mr. Chamberlain asked whether, in the light  of the  above,the Resident would wish to modify his views.   The telegram printed  in the last report[XVIII, p.  8] was  apparently the Residents  answer to this enquiry.   On  the 1st JuneMr. Chamberlain finally telegraphed that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided, after careful consideration, that the proposal of the Resident should not be proceeded with.The Resident therefore, whilst making  it quite  clear that any bond fide movementagainst  the Turks would be welcome, should reply as  suggested  in the  Viceroy&apos;telegram of the 1.7th May [Eastern Report XVII, p. 4].  Mr. Chamberlain added thatcareful watch  should be kept, and if there should be Italian movements, the earliestpossible intimation thereof should be given.
                                     PERSIA.    - The Shah. In answer to an inquiry from Lord R. Cecil [No. 161] as to the means,if any, of bringing pressure  to  bear on the Shah, Sir C. Marling telegraphed  on the31st May [No. 194] that to threaten to stop the moratorium instalments from whichthe civil  list was  paid was the oniy means of putting such  pressure on him, but thelate Prime Minister had already pointed out the possibility of such action  in the eventof an unfriendly Cabinet being formed.  In any case, he did not think there was muchto be done at present with the Shah personally by himself.  The political capital of theDemocrats and  Nationalists  consisted in Anglophobia now that Russian influence wasparalysed, and a demarche  by him would be seized upon as justification for their attitude.It seemed to be rather a time in which to allow the more intelligent sections of publicopinion to make themselves felt, and he was therefore keeping rather in the  background.     The Cabinet. Sir G. Buchanan said in the same telegram  [No. 194] that at presentAla-es-Sultaneh was supposed to be forming a Cabinet, but the real work was not in his hands ;  he was  almost senile.  Among those who had  put  him  forward there  werequarrels as to the distribution of offices, and the chances were doubtful as to his forming a Cabinet.                                     INDIA.    The Mahsuds. The Viceroy telegraphed on the  1st June that a report, dated the29th May, had been received from the political  agent at Wan a to the following effect  :An TJrina of Kanigorum had reported  that  Fazl  Din had informed a Mahsud jirga,held at that  place on the 27th May, that  he had received a letter from the Amirforbidding any Mahsud to go to Kabul for  allowances so long as the tribe was at warwith the Government,  and  also forbidding them to  fight unless our troops  should entertheir  country.   The Mahsuds had  replied that  they were willing to restore the stolenrifles  and to resume  friendly relations if their allowances were restored and prisonersreleased, otherwise they would be compelled to fight.   As to this the Viceroy said thatthe Amir&apos;s action,  if it had been correctly reported, put a new complexion  on the wholebusiness, and gave promise of real co-operation on the frontier ; the Mahsuds must havebeen  alarmed at our  concentration of troops  and greatly disheartened by the  Amir&apos;attitude.  In  those  circumstances  the  Indian Government had  been considering thepossibility of effecting an arrangement which would tide us over till the end of the warand avoid the risk of embarrassing  and estranging the Amir  by advancing, contrary tohis advice, into the Mahsud country.   But a report had  been received that a gang ofMahsuds  had surprised  the  Tut Narai post in Tochi on the 31st May,  capturing a quantity of rifles and ammunition and killing five militiamen.  This incident might put the idea of peaceful settlement out of the  question, but in the event of punitive action,it should justify us with the Amir even if he should be embarrassed by it.                                AFGHANISTAN.    The General Situation. The Viceroy, on the 1st June,  telegraphed  his monthlyreport as to the situation, which he said remained  quiet and  normal.   Considerablemoral  effect had apparently been  produced by the entry of the  United States intothe war.ADDENDA.                                    RUSSIA.    Industrial Crisis. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 4th June [No. 8;&apos;.2] thathe had spoken to M.  Terestchenko and Prince. Lvov on  the dangers to which Britishsubjects connected with factories were exposed owing to the threatening attitude of theworkmen.  Men would  not allow  them  either to close the  factories down or to leave them, and had in two cases threatened to kill the owners.   He had warned them thatthere  would be a strong revulsion of public opinion in England if British subjects were killed  owing  to the  inability of the  Uussian  Government to give them protection.While admitting  the  possibility of individual cases  of violence, they had both assuredhim that there were signs of improvement  in  the  general situation and  that the
demands of the  men, though  revolutionary in character,  would not be  enforced byrevolutionary means.                                                            M    Prince  Lvov  more  especially  took a hopeful view of the -future and.spoke witnconfidence as to the ultimate issue of the crisis, though he could not deny that there were anxious days before us.   From what M. Terestchenko had told him it seemed that the %Government was prepared to adopt  a firmer attitude.    (German Peace Efforts.-Pn the 5,th June, Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 836]that M. Terestchenko had informed  him that some weeks ago the Germans had sent a.flag of truce to General Dragomirov to discuss peace terms, but by the general&apos;s ordersthe bearers of  it had been returned  to their own lines.  It had now been announced by german wireless, with reference to  this incident, that the Bussian army and  nationcould have peace without annexations or  contributions, but that  the first duty of their government was to publish all treaties with the allies, who were  forcing Bussia to fight for their imperialistic aims.  When the Workmen.&apos;? Council was informed of this on the4th June M.. Tseretelli and others gave expression  to their feelings of indignation, and itwas decided to telegraph to the army warning it that Germany was trying to make &quot;itbetray the country.     The Workmerts Council  and  M. Kerensky. Sir G.  Buchanan also said in  theabove  telegram  [No. 836] that M. Terestchenko had told him  that there had been some anxiety  as &quot;to how the Workmen&apos;s Council would receive  M. Kerensky  on his return from the front;  but his  reception, when  he went  to  make  his  report  on  the4th June, had been a complete  triumph. The extremists who opposed him had beenshouted down, and the soldiers  and workmen had crowded  round him  offering  himmoney, medals,  and  crosses for the  War Loan  and  cheering enthusiastically.   Thesoldiers had sworn that they would  obey  his orders implicitly.                                    ARABIA.NEJD.     Ibn Saud and Ibn Rashid. Sir P. Cox telegraphed to Cairo on  the 5th Junesaying that news, dated the 12th May, had been  received from Ibn Saud to the effectthat he had been invited to make peace by Ibn Bashid, and that he had replied  thathe could not do so without ascertaining our wishes.   He  added that he  should prefer to keep him at bay, so far as he himself was concerned, but that  it appeared to be inthe interest of (?) Hejaz to bring him over to us.   Independent desert reports, however,asserted that  peace had already  been made.  Ibn Hadhdhal  had suggested that  IbnBashid was merely imposing on  Ibn Saud in order to gain time and obtain supplies.Mr. Storrs was just starting from Koweit, and would report the actual position.PKIHTID AT THB FOMIGW OFFICE BY G.
