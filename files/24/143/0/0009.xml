SECRET.                                                                   1 2 IAPPRECIATION  OF THE  ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT,  No.  IX.                                      RUSSIA.    IN reading the summary of Russian telegrams one point must be borne in mind,and that is, that the senders are all  subjected to  the  local atmosphere of Petrograd.In Petrograd itself there can be no doubt that matters are in a bad way.  With thenoblest intentions it is impossible for  an army to  do any good which  is subject to no authority either of  its  own or  anyone else&apos;s devising.  The Russian  revolution bearsmany  points of resemblance to  the Turkish  revolution, but  with  this  fundamental difference, that the secret forces in control in Constantinople were determined  to keepthe army in a state of  discipline and order as an instrument, while the secret  forces inPecrograd  seem equally determined  to  promote a state of paralysis in  the  army asa stepping-stone to anarchy.   The officers, it is  plain, are completely at sea, and havenot only  lost all authority but are ready to  compromise with the mutineers and onlytoo glad  to get out of  their uniforms  as  a way of avoiding  insults.   This  is the stateof affaire in Petrograd, what it maybe in  the  provinces is hard to tell; doubtless,superficially, things are better outside  Petrograd  than within it, but it is impossibleto say whether this is  because the  old wheels though closing down are still spinningor whether a vital  spark of belief in a Russia without an  Emperor actually exists andinspires masses of people who have never dreamt of such a thing before.                                     TURKEY.    The news from Turkey continues to show that the Ottoman Empire is feeling the strain.                                     ARABIA.    The news from Hejaz is  still satisfactory.                                      PERSIA.    The most  important news  from  Persia  is   the  repercussion  of the  Petrogradrevolution  in Teheran reported by  Sir  C.  Marling.   As  the Persian revolution was originally engineered by anarchists and  revolutionaries  from the Caucasus this is not surprising.   We may expect trouble at Bacu and in Transcaspia as time goes on.    March 29, 1917.                                                        M. S.898-36]

The  Provisional Government was officially recognised on the  22nd March by therepresentatives of  Great  Britain,  France,  Italy,  and  the United States [Petrograd,No.  373].   It  has also been recognised by Rumania [Jassy, No. 150] and by Switzerland[Berne, No. 250].   The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir R.  Rodd thathe had instructed the Italian Ambassador to enter into contact with the new Govern-ment,  and  generally to conform himself to  the action of his colleagues, but on  the25th March he was  not quite sure as to what had actually taken place [Rome, No. 265j.       [898-36]                                                             B
               Position and Intentions of the Provisional Government.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 26tfe March [No  404] in regard to the positionof the Provisional Government.  He said that the Ministers with whom he had spokenwhen he went to the Council on Saturday last  had given  him satisfactory assurancesas to the attitude  of the  troops and the resumption  of work.   In spite of  this thesituation caused him much anxiety, and the hopes which he had entertained of the warbeing more energetically prosecuted were gradually dwindling, and the situation causedhim much anxiety.   The  success  of the  workmen&apos;s Committee in undermining the discipline of the  army had had  a paralysing effect on the Government, which sooner or later would  be obliged to assert its authority, and then all would depend on the supporton which it  could count from the army.  In the trial of strength which  must come, the chances were in favour  of the  Moderates  but the possibility of the extremists beingvictors could not be  excluded.  If so the triumph  would not  last  for long it would inevitably  lead  to  a  counter-revolution;  but it would render  Russia   a negligiblequantity so  far as the war&apos;was concerned.  As for the intentions of the present Govern-ment, the Minister of Foreign  Affairs when replying to  Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s address tothe Council  had said that, as was known from its  public declarations, it was determined to uphold the agreement and alliances of its predecessors, and to prosecute the war to a victorious finish.                               A  Socialist Mission.     Mr.  Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan on the 28th March [No. 586] informing him that a mission composed of three or four French  Socialists was being sent to russia by the French Government, and  that  it  was proposed to send three British labour representatives with them.                               Condition of the  Army.     On the  21st  March the military attache telegraphed through Sir  G. Buchanan[No. 367] that (1) change of Government had been received quietly  at the front, so faras could be ascertained;  and (2) the  depot  troops  in  Petrograd, numbering some150,000 men, showed no inclination to return to work, and insisted on the keeping ofthe  promise that they should not be sent to the front.   Telegraphing again on the22nd [No. 374], he  said that he had  that morning visited the &quot;Volinski battalion and major Thornhill. the  Pavlov.  In  the Yolinski,  8,000 men were commanded  by anensign, who before the  war  had  been  a  gymnasium  instructor in Warsaw; all theregular officers had  been driven away.  Representatives of the men asked Colonel Knoxto tell the British  army that they would continue  the war till Germany was beaten.The Pavlov  battalion was commanded  by a Staff captain elected by the men ;  he was confident that the present wild ideas would pass away if we had patience, and said thatall the men were for war. .  Colonel Knox added that  Colonel Blair had stated that therewas  great relaxation of discipline  on  railways;  men crowded into first-class carriagesand, while the officers waited, sat in restaurant cars.     On the  24th March  he telegraphed  [No.  384] that he  and Major Thornhill  had visited the Tsarskoe Selo garrison and found the conditions better that in Petrograd ; inthe first rifle regiment men still saluted.     On the  25th he telegraphed again [No. 397] that the chief of the staff of the [? 9th]army was very pessimistic.   He remarked with truth that the  attitude of the men inPetrograd towards officers  grew worse every  day.   He thought that  the Council of workmen and Soldiers&apos; deputies would in  a few days  arrest the provisional  govern-ment to  control which they had already appointed four Socialists ; the secretary of theMinister  of War was also very pessimistic.   On  the  other hand, one of the ministers had  stated that the Council was losing ground ; and  the Minister of Justice  had saidthat in a week everything would be working properly and he should  be able to  sleep.     In the same  telegram  Colonel Knox  said that  the  exceptional amount  of snowwould prevent any important operations for five or six weeks, and by then the situation might be improved.  His French colleague thought that we could not count upon  anyRussian  offensive this year.  He  added  that the  food question  was causing great anxiety.     He telegraphed again [No.  408] on  the 27th March saying that the officers of the petrograd garrison  had  elected representatives  to  meet the soldiers&apos; delegates.  Themeeting had taken place on the previous  evening, and he  had been  present by invita-tion.  The men had proposed that  every soldier should  have the right to be a member
of any political, national relief, economic, or professional society he liked, and the furtherright of expressing freely and openly his political, religious, and social views;  that heshould be permitted to-wear  mufti when off  duty; that all saluting, on duty or off,should he abolished ; and that punishment should only be inflicted by court-martial.     Colonel Knox then attended  an officers&apos; committee under the presidency of thechief of the general staff.   After a four hours&apos; talk it was decided to  recommend thatpromotions to the rank of N.C.O. should  be subject to the veto of the  men ; and as aspecial protection to officers of  the  Petrograd garrison  from continual insult to whichthey were subjected in the streets, permission should be given for them to wear mufti.     Colonel Knox also reported that he and  Major Thoruhill had attended the Jaegerdep6t battalion and a railway regiment : in the former, men were sound on the warbut they had banished twenty-two of their officers, the latter had only sixteen out of itsoriginal sixty-four officers.  General Kprnilov was, he said, gradually bringing the troops of the garrison back to discipline.  The Minister of War bad returned from the northernfront, and the situation there was said  to be improved.   Colonel Knox said, too, thatthere were indications of tension between the labour and the  soldier  members of thecouncil of deputies ; and it was said  that the anarchists had unsuccessfully approached the 1st  depot regiment with a view to arresting the Duma.                             The Grand Duke Nicholas.     The Minister of Foreign Affairs stated on the 22nd March that, in view if the very strong and wide opposition in the  country, it  was impossible  for  the  Grand DukeNicholas to retain the chief command.  The Government had telegraphed to Rostov/ to stop his  going to headquarters, and hoped to induce  him to resign voluntarily.   TheGovernment would  be placed in a serious  predicament  if he did not do  so.   Sir G.Buchanan, expressing his own opinion, added that the refusal of the Grand Duke toaccept the decision of the Government would deal  a heavy blow at its  prestige, andmight be followed  by  disastrous consequences [Petrograd telegram No. 375].  Renterhas telegraphed that the Grand Duke Nicholas (with  six other grand dukes and othermembers  of the Imperial  family)  had  informed  the  Government  that  he entirelyassociated  himself with the  views  expressed in the Granl  Duke  Michaefs act  ofabdication ; he and the  others had expressed the  view that, in consequence of this act,their appanages should  become the property of the State.                       The Emperor and the Imperial Family.    The Minister of Foreign Affairs told Sir G. Buchanan on the 22nd March that hewas  most anxious for  the  Emperor  to leave  Russia, as the extremists were exciting-opinion against him as much as they  could.   But, unless he  went to  England under some  kind of guarantee that he  would  remain there till  the end  of the war, theGovernment could not allow him to leave the country.   He could not  be  permitted  togo to either Switzerland or Denmark,  as public  opinion would not tolerate it [Petrogradtelegram No. 372].    On the same day, before the receipt of the above, Mr. Balfour telegraphed to sir g. Buchanan [No.  544], saying that the  King and Government offered an asylum inEngland to the Emperor and Empress.    In  another telegram of the  same date, Mr.Balfour instructed Sir  G. Buchanan that, to avoid  any doubt in the future as to whyan asylum was given here, he should emphasise the fact that the offer was  entirely dueto the initiative of the Russian Government.    When this was  communicated by  Sir G.  Buchanan to  the  Minister of ForeignAffairs, the latter begged that the fact that the Prussian Government has asked that theEmperor should  come  to England might not  be published,  as the  extremists wereagitating against bis leaving Russia.  He again  assured the Ambassador that therewas  not the slightest cause of  anxiety in regard to  the  Emperors safety [No. 386,24th March].    On the 23rd March Mr. Balfour  telegraphed  again [No. 556], instructing  Sir G.Buchanan that he should immediately and urgently press the  Russian  GoA-ernment  togive an. absolute safe-conduct  to  the whole Imperial family to  Port Romanoff and england as soon as possible, pointing out the discredit which would attach to the new government if the Emperor or his family were injured, and adding that  we relied onthe Government ensuring the personal safety of the  Imperial family.
                                   FINLAND.                    Attitude of the Swedish Finns in Stockholm.    Sir Esme Howard telegraphed from Stockholm on the 23rd March [No.  1027] thatthe disaffected Swedish  Finns in Stockholm, who were more pro-German than. pro-Finn,  were  entirely disconcerted  by the announcement  of  the  re-establishment ofFinnish autonomy.  They had held a meeting and passed  resolutions  of  which thefollowing was a short summary :     1. It was still  an  open question whether the  Provisional Government in Russia           would be maintained in power, and therefore doubtful whether  its actions           would be finally confirmed by the  Russian  people : those who decided the           fate  of Russia could still enforce the principle that the Finnish State was           subject to Russian authority.    2. The Finnish people knew by experience that the Russian Government  had not           hesitated to break its most solemn promises  and  assurances in the past :           Russian statesmen and lawyers had not hesitated  to  declare that  promises           of freedom could be revoked.  This  was an additional reason why the           Finnish people should not allow themselves to rely on the proclamation.    3. The Finns had learnt that Russian assurances and concessions could not form           a safe basis for their future national existence ; that must have international           guarantees.    He said  further that Professor Soderhjelm, of Helsingfors, who had not  attendedthis meeting  as  he regarded the  extremists  who had organised it  as a danger to finland, had asked him whether England and France would join in guaranteeing theautonomy of Finland ;  whilst dissociating himself from the  resolutions  passed at themeeting, he maintained that the Finnish question should be settled internationally.  Whenhe told him that it was most difficult for England to move in  the matter, the  professorasked  if England and  France could not publicly  express to the Russian Governmenttheir  satisfaction at the  re-establishment  of  Finnish State rights ; and he had said tothis that he would submit the proposition to Mr. Balfour.    On the 26th March Sir Esme  Howard telegraphed again [No. 1060] saying thatnumbers of Russian Finnish fugitives and exiles,  including no  doubt Nihilists and otherextremists, were said to be arriving in Sweden  from Germany and Switzerland, and  itwas believed that the Germans were sending them to make trouble  in Russian  Finland ;the commercial attache had been  informed that 200,000 crowns had been subscribed in stockholm for the repatriation of Russian Finnish exiles and fugitives.                                   POLAND.                            Attitude towards Germany.    Mr.  Balfour telegraphed to  Sir G.  Buchanan [No.  54 3] on  the 22nd Marchinforming him  of an  argument  presented by M.  Roman  Dmovski  in  regard to theGerman effort to raise a Polish army.   He said that one of  the main obstacles to thesuccess of the German effort  to raise an  army of 800,000  men in Poland was the factthat the most  important Poles had taken an. oath of allegiance to the  Emperor ofRussia ; from this they had been freed  by the revolution, so that one of the motives forresisting German pressure had been removed.  The danger might  be averted if theEntente Powers would now take  a strong line  about  Polish independence;  Englandmust lead the way,  and what was to be done should  be done quickly, or German)&apos; might find her army  strengthened by  an addition of  three-quarters of a million  men.Mr. Balfour asked for Sir G. Buchanaifs observations on the scheme.    On the 25th March Sir G. Buchanan replied [No. 395]  saying that we could hardlyact, except in agreement with the Russian  Government,  in favour of  the suggestionthat we should start  an international campaign  in  favour of  the independence ofPoland.  M. Miliukoff had recently declared his opposition  to the idea of independence and a separate  army; M. de&apos; Sazanow and many others shared this  view.  Since thereceipt of Mr.  Balfoups  telegram he had spoken  again to M. Miliukoff, pointing outthat it would be easier at the peace conference to obtain international sanction for there constitution of an independent  Kingdom of Poland, including the greater part of theprovince of Posen, than for the reunion of Austrian,  German, and Russian Poland under
Russia&apos;s sovereignty.  To this M. Miliukoff replied that there would be always  thedanger  of Poland being drawn into the German  orbit: and Poland might be won overto Germany by a promise  of those  Western provinces  of  Russia which, though  notPolish by race, had once been incorporated in the Kingdom of Poland.   If Poland wasto be independent there  must be some guarantee against her coming under german influence.  Sir G. Buchanan thought that our best course would be to explain to  theRussian Government our reasons for fearing that, unless something were done to reassure the Poles, there was a serious danger of. their turning to Germany.   If  independenceappeared the best policy to His Majestys Government, he might be instructed to explainits views privately to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.     Mr. Balfour telegraphed again on the 28th March [No. 592] saying that he agreedthat we must keep Russia with us in our treatment of the, Polish question ;  but thatit was very important  that certain aspects of that question, which deeply affect  theAllies, should be borne in mind by the Russian Government.     1.  The re-creation of Poland in  any satisfactory shape must affect Austria andGermany as  well as  Russia :  in - other  words,  the  Polish  question  was necessarilyinternational and not merely  Russian.     2.  The Poles had  it in their power to add  enormously to Germany&apos;s strength byjoining  the German forces either as soldiers or as workmen.  In spite of all temptationsthey had been so far restrained from  doing so, partly by their hatred of the Germans,partly by their hopes  of Allied assistance in realising their national  aspirations.   if russia  destroyed the  second of  these motives, would the first be sufficient ?   If not,the Allied cause would suffer a more serious blow than that inflicted by  the defeat of roumania.     Bearing these two points in mind, would it  not, he asked, be desirable to sound the Russian  Government as  to the policy  of  making some declaration about Polishfreedom which would give  reasonable  satisfaction  to  the Poles, and making this declaration not merely  in the name of Russia, but in that of the Allies generally ?     Mr. Balfour said that he reeognised that the difficulties were great;  and  that  theProvisional Government must be overwhelmed with the magnitude  of  the problems ithad to face.   &apos; He would,  he said, gladly have let the matter rest for the moment wereit not for his fear that  pro-German propaganda might  make serious progress during  thepresent   Russian  crisis  if  nothing  were  done  to  counteract  it.  He  asked  for sir  G.  Buchanan&apos;s considered reflections (after consulting  anyone  whose  opinion hethought of value) on the above points.                                  . RUMANIA.                             The Evacuation Problem.     Sir G.  Barclay telegraphed on  the  22nd  March  [No.  149] that  on receipt ofMr. Balfour&apos;s telegram  [Eastern Report VIII, p.  8] he had  told his Russian colleaguethat he  had been instructed to support him, but he preferred  for the moment  to treat the matter himself and had not asked for Sir G. Barclay&apos;s support.  The French repre-sentative had not received instructions to support the Russian  Minister,&quot; and Sir G.Barclay  doubted as to whether  he would receive any.   The  evacuation of 60,000cavalry  had been decided upon.  As  to the evacuation of the rest of the army, or  thegreater  part of it, General Berthelot had declared  it to be impossible in  view  of  thepresent  sanitary condition of the troops ;  and General Sakharoff was believed to be  notin favour of it.  The  Russian Minister  had advised the Rumanian Government to evacuate a division to be reformed.   On  consulting the military authorities he foundthis to be impossible on  account  of  the  sanitary conditions, lack of boots and  other equipment, and when these should have been remedied evacuation  would  be no longer necessary.  Ho pointed out, too, that even if the evacuation were begun when the roadsbecame  practicable (the thaw having made them impossible for the moment), the troopsinvolved would be precluded from taking part in any fighting before the end of July.                                    TURKEY.                          Mission to the German Emperor:    Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed on the 24th March [No. 251] that a mission, consistingof an officer and a representative of the Turkish Parliament, had been sent by the Sultan      ,.898-36]   .         .                                             C
to the German Emperor with a letter requesting the release of Turkish  troops, now onthe Galician  and Rumanian fronts, for service in the  Turkish dominions, as without them the Turkish  Government could not guarantee  the  maintenance  of  order in its territory.  The Bulgarian Government was reported to have declared  that  it  would oppose the release of Turkish troops with the Bulgarian forces; the Turks must abide by their-treaty engagements.                                  . .                                  Rifaat Pasha.     An agent reports that Rifaat Pasha, formerly Turkish  Minister of Foreign Affairs,left Geneva for Berlin on the 10th March, a special train  taking him from the Swissfrontier.   It is, he says, rumoured that there is - some chance of his  replacing HakkiPasha as Ambassador at  Berlin,  the latter having  had  a  serious  quarrel with theGermans over the question of Turkish troops in Europe.                                 THE SENUSSI.                               Relations with Idrisi.     Sir  R. Rodd telegraphed on the  22nd  March [Nos. 251 and  252] that he  had urged the  importance of giving concrete proof of  our support of Idrisi and increasinghis prestige by a favourable consideration of his request to open markets.   The generalpurport of  the idea of the Minister of the  Colonies was that Idrisi  should accept themodus vivendi in principle (as it was recognised  that he could not at present bedisarmed),  and that we and the Italians should  open our markets, reserving to ourselvesthe right to close them if Idrisi could not or would not carry out his engagements.  TheMinister objected to  some  of idrisis  demands, among others that part of Zuleitanashould be  kept  open for  the supply  of arms  and ammunition,  and that quick-firingguns should be supplied ;  but it was hardly to be supposed that Idrisi expected  assent to these.                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.                                    Operations.     Sir  R. Wingate telegraphed to the C.IG.S. on  the  23rd March [A.B. 086],  thatit had been  reported  by  Emir Ali  that,  after two  days&apos;  fighting, his  troops  had occupied Bir Darwish, and  pursued Turks to  El Mangar.   In his opinion, the enemy would retire  altogether to Medina.   The captures  included 1  captain  and 9  men,237 rifles, and a quantity of rifle and gun ammunition.     He  telegraphed again on  the 24th March [A.B. 091] that  a raid detachment  ofSherif FeisaPs troops had raided  the railway line  a few  miles south  of  El Ula,destroying  a  considerable portion of railway line  and  three culverts.   No  sign of theenemy had been seen, by  the raiding  party,  who  stayed  twelve  hours by  the  line.Further raids on El Ula were  in progress.     And again, on the the  25th March [A.B. 098], saying  that the transfer of theR.F.C. flight and of the Egyptian army detachments from Babegh  to Wej had beencompleted.                               Banking in Jeddah.     In response to a suggestion made by Sir R. Wingate [No. 282] on the  26th March;Mr. Balfour authorised  him [No. 312] to make arrangements with  Gellatly,  Hankey5and  Co.  to  take  the  place  in Jeddah  of the  Ottoman Bank, up to the  time  of theestablishment of which they had done practically all the banking there was to be done as well as  the financial business of pilgrims.   Mr.  Balfour made the proviso  that the firm should not  for the moment start anything in  the nature  of an ostensibly newbanking business, but should expand on existing lines.          .ADEN.                                    Operations.     The G.O.C. telegraphed on the 22nd March  TNo. 508] that reports  indicated  thatthere was  fighting in the vicinity of Taiz and in Yusufiyin between Arabs friendly tothe Turks and others hostile, and that small parties  had been sent from Lahej to supportthe former;  and again on  the 26th  March [No. 529] that it was reported  that the Ifisrhtins: near Taiz had ceased, and that Mohammed Nazir  Bukbil  and  Savid Ahmed SPasha were expected at Lahej.
                                MESOPOTAMIA.                       Russian and English Spheres of Action.     The C.I.G.S. telegraphed on the 22nd March to the G.O.C.  Force  &quot;I) &quot;  instructing him to come to an agreement with the Russian commanders to observe spheres of action,the scope of which should be dictated only by military exigencies, and to make it plainto the Russian commanders that these  spheres  had no  relation to spheres  of political influence, but  were only spheres of  military action.  The spheres of  political influencehad been defined by a formal agreement already  signed by the  three Governments ofGreat Britain, France, arid Russia.  In accordance with  this  agreement the political control  and administration of  the  Ottoman territory occupied by either force  to  thesouth of a line drawn from a point on  the  Pei-sian frontier  north  of the Wazna  Pass.along the Lesser Zab, and of the line Kalajebaar on the Tigris, and Abu Kemal on theEuphrates, should be placed in the hands of the C.P.O.                      Relations with Nuri Shaalan and Others.     Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to Sir P. Cox  on the 24th  March saying that fromBaghdad it should  be possible  to considerably assist the  operations in Palestine and mesopotamia by getting into touch with Nuri Shaalan, the Hauran Druzes,  the Yezidisof Sinjar, the  Shammar of  Mesopotamia, and the Anazeh of Hachim  at  Kelat Jabaar ;an effort should be made to induce  them to send agents to headquarters  as liaisons.His Majestys Government would be glad to receive an early report of the  opening upof such relations.                                    PERSIA.                          Effect of the Russian Revolution.     Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the  27th March [No. 11 5] that the Russian revolutionwas having  its effect in Persia,  and might profoundly modify the situation.  The Shahwas in full sympathy with the hostile elements which were  spreading the  belief thatthe  new  regime in Russia  closely sympathised with the young Persian constitutionalideals and aims, and would be ready to reverse the former Russian policy.   They were making every  effort to wreck the Cabinet, and were insisting that demands should bemade on Russia in the above sense, arguing that the Prime Minister  would not make them with vigour.                             .  South Persian Rifles.     Sir C. Marling telegraphed  on the 20th March [No. 108] that he had receivedfrom the Persian  Government a reply recognising  Sir P. Sykes, but  without anydefinition of his power.  The note proposed the introduction of instructors of a thirdPower into the forces being raised in Persia by Great Britain and Russia ; in regard to the financing of the force after the war, the Persian Government desired to make provisionfrom the surplus of the customs revenue resulting  from a revision of tariffs, and invitedHis Majesty&apos;s  Governments  adhesion  to this proposal.   The Foreign Office replied onthe 23rd March [No. 93] that Sir C. Marling might reply orally  to the note to the effectthat His Majesty&apos;s Government  would receive sympathetically any proposal respecting the  customs tariff which  he might be asked to forward,  but this should  not bebracketed with the question of British instructors.  To suggest that the retention ofBritish instructors had not been definitely decided upon, and that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would be prepared to  bargain on  the subject  in  connection with the customstariff appeared to be open  to grave objection.                     Proposed Railway from Astara to Teheran.     The Foreign. Office telegraphed to Sir C. Marling on the 23rd March [No. 94] that,in view of the  present situation  in Persia, it seemed  inopportune to make any jointapplication on  the subject of the proposed railway from Astara to Teheran [EasternReport V, 8].   This, however, must not be  taken  to imply that a concession of a line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman would not be applied for by His Majesty&apos;s government when an opportune moment presented itself

SYRIA.                      The  Raw Material.  [Fragmentary notes written early in 1915, but not circulated.]     Geographically, Syria  is much parcelled out.   The first and greatest longitudinal division is made by the  mountains, which run like a rugged spine north and  south close to the sea, and shut off the  peoples  of the  coast from those of  the interior. Those of the coast speak a  different Arabic, differently  intoned ; they live in different houses, eat different  food, and gain their living differently.   They speak of the &quot; interior  &quot;  unwillingly, as a wild land full of blood and terror.     The interior is divided again  longitudinally.   The peasants in the valleys of the Jordan, Litani and Orontes are the most stable,  most prosperous j^eomen  of the1 country;  and beyond them is  the strange shifting population  of the  border  lands, wavering eastward or westward with the season, living  by  their wits only, wasted  by droughts  and locusts, by Bedouin  raids, and if tbese fail them, by their own incurable blood-feuds.     Each of these main north and south  strip-divisions is crossed and walled  off into  compartments  mutually at odds : and it is necessary,- if political composition  of  Syria is  to  be  gauged, to enumerate some of the heads of these.     The boundary between Arab  and Turkish speech follows, not  inaptly,  the coach-ixtad from Alexandretta  to Ezaz,  and thence the Baghdad railway to Jerablus.   On the  west it begins among   Ansariya,  disciples of  a   strange  cult of a  principle of  fertility,  sheer  pagan, anti-foreign,   distrustful of  Moham- medanism,  but  drawn for  the  moment to  Christianity by the attraction of common persecution ;  the sect is very vital in itself, and as  clannish  in  feeling and  politics as  a   sect  can  be. One Nosairi will&apos; not betray another, and they will  hardly not betray  Mohammedan and  Christian.   Their villages are sown in patches down the main hills from Missis  to Tartus  and  the Tripoli gap,  and their sheikhs are  Aissa  and  old Maaruf.   They speak  Arabic  only, and  they have lived  there since,  at  least, the beginning of Greek history.  They stand aside from politics, and  leave  the  Turkish Government alone in  hope  of reciprocity.     Mixed among  the Ansariya are colonies of Syrian Christians, and  south  of  the  Orontes  are  (or   were)  solid  blocks  of Armenians, who spoke  Turkish,  but would  not  consort  with Turks.   Inland, south of Harim, are settlements of Druses (whoare Arabs)  and  Circassians.    These have  their  hand againstevery man.   North-east of  them are Kurds, speaking  Kurdishand Arabic, settlers of some generations back, who are marryingArabs and adopting their politics.    They hate native  Christiansmost, and next to  them  Turks  and Europeans.   Just beyondthe Kurds are some Yezidis, Arabic-speaking, but always tryingin their worship to placate a spirit  of evil, and with a warpedadmiration for  crude  bronze birds.  Christians, Mohammedans
and Jews unite to spit upon the  Yezid.   After  the  Yezidis  liesAleppo, a town of a quarter of  a million  of  people,  and  anepitome of all races and religions.  Eastward of Aleppo for sixtymiles you pass through settled Arabs, whose colour  and mannerbecomes more and  more tribal as  you approach  the  fringe of cultivation, where the  semi-nomad ends  and the Bedawi begins.     If you  take  another  section across Syria, a degree more to  the south, you  begin  with  some colonies  of MohammedanCircassians  near  the sea.   They speak Arabic  now and  arean  ingenious but quarrelsome race, much opposed by their Arabneighbours.  Inland of them are districts reserved for Ismailiya.These  speak  Arabic,  and  worship among  themselves  a kingMohammed,; who, in the flesh, is the Agba Khan.  They believehim to be a great and wonderful  sovereign, honouring the Englishwith his protection.  They hate Arabs and orthodox  Muslimih,and look for  the crumbling of  the Turk.  Meanwhile, they areloathed  and trampled on by their  neighbours, and are driven to conceal  their  beastly  opinions  under a veneer of  orthodox)&apos;.Everyone  knows  how  thin that is,  and they  maintain  among themselves  signs  and  pass-words by  which  they know  one another.  Miserably poor  in appearance, they  pay the  Aghaa princely tribute every year.  Beyond the Ismailiya is a strangesight, villages  of Christian  tribal Arabs, some of  semi-nomadhabits,  under  their own sheikhs.   Very  sturdy Christians theyare, most unlike their snivelling  brethren in the hills.   They liveas do the Sunnis round them, dress like  them, speak like them,and are on the best of terms with them.  East of these Christiansare semi-nomad Muslim peasants, and east of them again somevillages of Ismailiya outcasts, on the extreme edge of cultivation,whither they  have retired in  search   of  comparative peace.Beyond them only Bedouins.     Take another section  through Syria, a degree lower down,between Tripoli and Beyrout.   To begin with,  near  the coast,are Lebanon Christians, Maronites and  Greeks for  the  mostpart.   It is hard to disentangle  the politics of the two churches.Superficially, one should be French and the other Russian,  buta part of the Maronites now have been in the United States, andhave developed there an Anglo-Saxon vein which is not the  lessvigorous  for  being  spurious.    The  Greek   church  pridesitself on  being old Syrian, autocthonous, of  an intense localpatriotism  that (with  part) would  rather fling it into  the arms  of the  Turk   than endure  irretrievable  annexation by aRoman power.   The adherents  of the two churches are at  one in unmeasured slander of Mohammedans and their religion.   Theysalve a consciousness of inbred  inferiority by this verbal scorn.Behind and among the Christians  live families  of MohammedanSunnis,  Arabic-speaking, identical in race  and  habit with  the christian, marked off from them by a less mincing dialect, and adistaste for emigration and its results.  On the  higher slopes ofthe hills  are  serried settlements  of  Metawala, Shia  Moham-medans who came  from  Persia centuries ago.   They are dirty,
- 109 -130ignorant, surly, and fanatical.   They will  not eat or drink withan infidel (the Sunni as bad as the Christian), follow their ownpriests and notables, speak Arabic but  disown in every way thepeople, not their co-sectarians, who live about them.   Across the hills are  villages of Christians, yeomen,  living at peace with theirSunni neighbours, as though they had never heard the grumblesof their fellows in the Lebanon.   East  of  them are  semi-nomadArab peasant^.     Take a section a degree lower down, near  Acre.   There arefirst,  Sunni Arabs, then Druses, then  Metawala  to the jordan valley, near which are many bitterly-suspicious Algerian colonies,mixed in with  villages of aboriginal  Palestinian Jews.   Thelatter are an  interesting race.   They  speak  Arabic  and goodHebrew  ; have developed a standard and style  of  living suitable to the country,  and  yet much better than the manner of  theArabs.   They  cultivate the land, and  hide their lights ratherunder bushels,  since their example would be a great  one for  theforeign   (German  inspired) colonies of agricultural  Jews,  whointroduce strange manners of cultivatioirand crops, and Europeanhouses (erected out of  pious subscriptions),  to a country likePalestine, at once too small  and  too poor to repay  efforts on sucha scale.   The Jewish colonies of North  Palestine pay  their wayperhaps,   but  give  no  proportionate  return  on their capitalexpenditure.   They  are, however, honest   in  their  attempts atcolonization, and deserve honour, in  comparison with the largersettlements of  sentimental  remittance-men in South  Palestine.Locally,  they are more than tolerated ; one  does not find roundGalilee the deep-seated antipathy  to  Jewish colonists and aimsthat is such an unlovely feature  of the  Jerusalem area.  Acrossthe Eastern plain (Arabs), you come to the Leja, a labyrinth  ofcrackled  lava, where all the  loose and broken men of Syria haveforegathered for unnumbered generations.  Their  descendantslive there in rich lawless villages, secure from the Government andBedouins, and working out their own internecine feuds at leisure.South of them  is the  Hauran,  peopled by Arabs and Druses.The latter are  Arabic-speaking, a heterodox Mohammedan sect,who revere a mad and dead  Sultan of Egypt, and hate Maroniteswith  a  hatred which,  when  encouraged by  the   ottoman government   and  the  Suuni  fanatics  of  Damascus,  findsexpression in great periodic killings.   None the less, the Drusesare despised  by the  Mohammedan Arabs,  and dislike them  inreturn.   They hate the  Bedouins, obey their  own  chiefs,  and preserve  in their Hauran fastnesses a parade of the chivalroussemi-feudalism  in  which they lived in the  Lebanon, in the days of the great Emirs.     A section a degree lower would  begin  with German ZionistJews, speaking  a bastard Hebrew and  German Yiddish,  moreintractable than  the  Jews  of the  Roman   era,   unable   toendure near  them  anyone  not  of  their   race, some  of  themagriculturists, most of them shop-keepers, the most foreign, most
uncharitable part or its  whole population.   Behind these  Jewsis. their  enemy,  the Palestine  peasant,  more  stupid  than the peasant of North Syria, materialist and bankrupt.   East of himlies the Jordan valley, inhabited by a  charred  race of serfs, and beyond it, group upon group  of  self-respecting tribal or villageChristians, who are,  after their  co-religionists of  the  Orontesvalley, the least timid examples  of their  faith in the  country.Among the&apos;m, and  east  of  them,  are semi-nomad and nomadArabs of the religion of the desert, living on the fear and bountyof their  Christian neighbours.  Down this debateable  land theOttoman  Government  has planted  a long  line  of  Circassianimmigrants.   They  hold their  ground on\j  by the sword andthe favour of the Turks, to whom they are consequently devoted.     These odd races and religions do not  complete the tale of theraces of Syria.  There  are still the six  great  towns, Jerusalem,Beyrout, Damascus, llama, Homs, and  Aleppo to  be reckonedapart from the country folk in any accounting  of Syria.     Jerusalem is a dirty town which  all  Semitic  religions  havemade  holy.   Christians and  Mohammedans come  there  onpilgrimage; Jews look to it for the political future of their race.In it the  united  forces of the past are  so strong  that the cityfails to have a present :  its  people, with the  rarest exceptions,are  characterless as  hotel  servants,  living  on the  crowd  ofvisitors passing  through.  Questions of Arabs and  their nation-ality are as far from them as bimetallism from  the life of Texas,though familiarity with the differences among Christians in theirmoment of most fervent expression has led the Mohammedans of jerusalem to despise (and dislike) foreigners generally.     Beyrout is altogether new.  It would be all bastard French infeeling, as in language, but for  its Greek harbour and its Americancollege.  Public opinion in it is that of the Christian merchants, allfat men, who live by exchange, for Beyrout itself produces nothing.After the merchants its strongest  component is  the  class ofreturned emigrants,  living on  their invested savings, in the town of Syria which,  to them, most resembles the Washington Avenuewhere they &quot;made good.&quot;   Beyrout is the door of Syria, with aLevantine screen  through which shop-soiled  foreign influencesflow into  Syria.   It is as representative of  Syria as Soho of theHome Counties, and yet  in Beyrout,  from  its  geographical position, from its schools, from the freedom engendered by inter-course with  many foreigners, there  was a nucleus  of people,Mohammedans,  talking  and   writing and thinking   like thedoctrinaire cyclopaadists who  paved  the  way  for  revolution inFrance, and  whose  words  permeated to  parts of the  interiorwhere action is in  favour.   For  their  sake (many  of  the mare  martyrs  now,  in Arab  eyes)  and,  for  the  power  of  itswealth, and for its exceeding loud and ready voice,  Beyrout is to be reckoned with.     Damascus, Homs, Hamah, and Aleppo are the  four ancientcities  in  which  Syria  takes  pride.   They are stretched like a
chain along the fertile valleys of  the interior, between the desertand the hills ; because of their setting the)&apos;&apos; turn their backs uponthe sea and look eastward.  They are Arab and know themselvessuch.     Damascus is  the old inevitable head of Syria.  It is the seat of la)7 government  and  the religious centre, three days only from the Holy City by its railway.   Its  sheikhs are  leadersof  opinion,  and  more  &quot; Meccan&quot; than others elsewhere.  its people are  fresh  and  turbulent, always willing  to  strike, asextreme in their words and acts as in their pleasures.  Damascuswill move before any part of Syria.   The Turks made it  their military centre, just  as naturally  as  the Arab Opposition, orOppenheim  and  Sheikh  Shawish established  themselves there.Damascus is a lodestar to which Arabs  are naturally drawn, anda  city  which will  not  easily be convinced  that it  is  subjectto any  alien race.     Hamah  and  Horns  are towns which   dislike one another.Everyone in  them  manufactures  things in Horns, generallycotton and wool,  in  Hamah, silk and brocade.  Their industries were prosperous and increasing ; their  merchants were quick totake advantage of new  outlets, or  to meet  new tastes.  north africa, the Balkans, Syria, Arabia, Mesopotamia used their stuffs.They demonstrated  the  productive  ability  of Syria, unguidedby foreigners, as  Beyrout  demonstrated  its  understanding ofcommerce.  Yet, while  the  prosperity of   Beyrout  has made it Levantine, the prosperity of Horns and Hamah has reinforcedtheir localism, made  them   more  entirely   native, and morejealously native than  any other Syrian  towns.  It almost seemsas  though  familiarity  with   plant and power had  shown  thepeople there that the manners of  their fathers were the best.     Aleppo is the largest city in Syria, but  not of  it,  nor ofTurkey, nor of Mesopotamia.  Rather it is a point where all theraces, creeds and tongues of the Ottoman.Empire meet and knowone  another in a  spirit of  compromise.  The clash  of variedcharacteristics, which makes its streets a kaleidoscope, has imbuedin the Aleppine a kind of thoughtfulness, which corrects  in  himwhat is wanton in the Damascene.   Aleppo  has shared in eachof the civilizations which turn about it, and  the result seems tobe a lack of zest in all that its people do.  Even so,  they  surpassthe rest of Syria in most things.   They fight and trade more, are more fanatical and vicious, and make most beautiful things, but all with a dearth of conviction that  renders their  great strengthbarren.   It  is  typical of Aleppo  that   here,  where  yetMohammedan feeling runs high, there is more fellowship betweenChristian and Mohammedan, Armenian, Arab,  Kurd,  Turk  andJew, than in, perhaps,  any  other  great city  of the ottoman empire, and  more friendliness, though  less  licence  is accorded to Europeans  on the part of  the average Mohammedan.   Aleppowould stand  aside from political  action  altogether  but  for theinfluence of the great unmixed Arab quarters  which  lie on its
 outskirts like overgrown, half-nomad  villages.  These are, after the  Maidari  of Damascus,  the  most  national  of  any  parts of towns,  and the intensity of  their  Arab  feeling  tinges  the rest  of  the  citizens  with  a  colour  of  nationalism,  which is  by  so  much  less  vivid  than the  unanimous  opinion  of Damascus.     In the creeds and races above described, and in others  not enumerated, lie the raw  materials of  Syria for  a  statesman.   It will  be noted that  the  distinctions  are political  or religious; morally the peoples somewhat resemble one another, with a steady gradation  from neurotic sensibility,  on  the coast, to reserve, inland.   They are quick-minded,  admirers (but not seekers) of truth,  self-satisfied,  not incapable (as  are  the  Egyptians)  of abstract  ideas,  but unpractical,  and  so lazy mentally as to be superficial.   Their wish  is to be  left alone to  busy  themselves with others&apos; affairs.   From childhood they are lawless, obeying their fathers  only as long as they fear to be beaten, and their government later for the same reason:  yet there are few races with a greater respect than the upland Syrian for customary law.   All of them  want something new, for with their superficiality and their lawlessness is combined a passion for politics, the science of which it is fatally easy for  the Syrian  to gain a smattering, and too difficult to gain a mastery.   They are all discontented with the government  they  have, but few  of them honestly combine  their  ideas  of  what   they  want.   Some  (mostly Mohammedans)  cry  for  an  Arab   kingdom,   some  (mostly Christians) for a foreign protection of  an altruistic thelemic order, conferring  privileges  without obligation.  Others  cry for auto- autonomy for Syria.     Autonomy is  a comprehensible word, Syria is not, for  the words Syria and Syrian are foreign terms.   Unless he has learnt English or  French, the inhabitant of  these parts has no word to describe all his country.  Syria in  Turkish (the word exists  not in Arabic)  is the province of Damascus.   Sham in Arabic is  the town of Damascus.   An  Aleppine  always  calls  himself   an Aleppine, a Beyrouti a Beyrouti, and  so  down to the  smallest villages.     This verbal poverty indicates a political condition.  There is-no national  feeling.   Between town and town, village and village, family  and family, creed and  creed, exist intimate  jealousies, sedulously fostered by the Turks to render a  spontaneous union impossible.  The  largest indigenous  political entity  in  settled Syria is  only  the village under  its  sheikh, and  in  patriarchal Syria the tribe  under its chief.   These leaders are chosen,  not formally, but by opinion from the entitled families, and they rule by custom  and consent.  All the constitution above them  is  the artificial bureaucracy of the Turk, maintained by force, impossible if it were to be carried out according to its paper scheme, but in practice either fairly  good or very bad, according to the less or greater  frailty of the human instruments through which it works.
     Time seems  to have  proclaimed that autonomous  union is beyond the  powers of such  a people.  In  history, Syria is always  the corridor between  sea  and desert, joining Africa  toAsia, and Arabia to Europe.  It has been a prize-ring for  thegreat peoples lying about it, alternately the vassal of Asia Minor,Egypt,  Greece, Rome, Arabia or Mesopotamia, and when given amomentary independence by  the  weakness of  its neighbours, ithas at once resolved itself fiercely into Northern and Southern,Eastern and Western discordant &quot; kingdoms,&quot; with the areas andpopulations at best of Yorkshire, at worst of   Rutland ;  for ifSyria is by nature  a vassal country, it is  also by habit a country of agitations and rebellions.     The  proposals  to make Syria an Arab or  foreign-protectedcountry are, of course, far from  the  hearts of the &quot; autonomy&quot;party, but the  conviction of  their internal  divisions,  and  theevident signs that Syria&apos;s neighbours are not going to be of  theweak sort that enable it  to  snatch a momentary independence,have reconciled these parts  to having such proposals constantlyon their lips.                                              ^fc     By  accident  and  time  the Arabic language has graduallypermeated the country, until  it is now almost  the  only one in use ; but  this  does  not mean that  Syria any more than Egypt is an  Arabian  country.   On the sea  coast there is little, if any,Arabic  feeling or tradition :  on  the desert edge there is much.Indeed, racially, there is perhaps something to be said for  thesuggestion thrown in  the  teeth  of geography  and economics of -putting the  littoral  under one government,  and the interiorunder another.                         &quot;Tp          *J&quot;1*          *7r     Whatever the  limits of future politics, it&apos; can  hardly  becontested  that, like a European Government, an Arab Governmentin Syria, to-day or  to-morrow, would be  an  imposed one, as  theformer  Arab Governments  were.   The  significant thing is  toknow what local bases, if any, such a Government would have ;and one finds  that  it would be  buttressed on  two fronts, bothcontained in the word &quot; Arab,&quot; which seems to  strike a chord insome of the most unlikety minds.   The  Mohammedans, whosemother tongue is Arabic, look upon themselves, for that reason,as a chosen people.   The patriotism which should have attacheditself to soil or race has  been warped to  fit a  language.   Theheritage of the Koran and  the  classical poets  holds the Arabic-speaking  peoples together&apos;.    The  second buttress  of an Arabpolity is the dim distortion  of the old glories  and conquests ofthe  Arabian  Khalifate,   which has  persisted   in  the  popularmemory  through  centuries  of Turkish  misgovernment.   the accident that these ideas savour rather of Arabian Nights than ofsober history retains the Arabs in  the conviction that their pastwas greater than the present of the Ottoman Turks.
-   114 -     To sum up-a review of the present components of Syriaproves  it  as vividly coloured  a racial  and  religious  mosaicto-day as  it has  notoriously  been  in the  past.   Any  wideattempt  at autonomy would  end in  a patched  and  parcelledthing, an imposition on a  people whose instincts for ever  andever have been for parochial home-rule.   It is equally clear thatthe seething discontent which Syrians cherish with the presentTurkish administration is common enough  to render possible afleeting general movement towards a new factor, if  it  appearedto offer a chance realization of the ideals of centripetal nationalismpreached by the Beyrout  and Damascus cyclopajdists of the lasttwo generations.  Also, that only by the intrusion of a new factor,founded on  some outward power or non-Syrian basis,  can thedissident tendencies of the sects and peoples of  Syria  be reinedin sufficiently to prevent destructive anarchy.  The  more  loose,informal, inchoate this new government, the less  will be the inevitable disillusionment  following on its  institution ;  for the true  ideal  of  Syria,  apart  from the  minute  but vociferousChristian element,  is  not an  efficient administration,  but theminimum  of  central power  to  ensure peace, and  permit  theunchecked  development of customary  law.   Also, that the onlyimposed government that will find, in Moslem Syria,, any  reallyprepared groundwork or large body of adherents is a Sunni one,speaking  Arabic, and pretending to  revive  the Abbassides orAyubides.                                                   T. E. L.                         ARABIA.                           Hejaz.                         Intelligence.     It was  stated in our last issue that the withdrawal  by theTurks of  their reserve  rations from Mijz, on the Fura road, toBir el-Mashi, indicated that they intended a further retirement.This  has  now taken place.   Sherif Zeid  has  reported that hisadvanced  guard has occupied Gradir Rabugh, near Mijz, that theenemy is retreating and that Bir el-Mashi itself is being besiegedby the Arabs.   This was confirmed by an  aeroplane  reconnais-sance on February 28, over  Mijz, which appeared to be occupiedby Zeid&apos;s  forces, although no ground signal was shown.  Owingto Zeid&apos;s failure to carry out instructions about a  landing ground,a more  extensive reconnaissance was however impossible.  the landing ground referred  to is probably  at Abud,  a  few miles south of Mijz.  It was  partially cleared and a landing was madeon  February 19, the pilot and observer being given a good recep-tion  by Zeid  and his  Arabs.  The airmen were informed thatrefugees were frequently arriving from Medina,  which they had left owing to lack of provisions.   Since then, Mijz itself seemsto have been used as a landing-ground.
     A delegation of four notables from Medina arrived recently at Mecca and confirmed the report that the tomb of the Prophet had been pillaged.   The &quot;Kibla&quot; states, with regard to this, that the Nazir of Wakfs  himself came from Constantinople and took away with him all the money&apos;and treasures, valued at thirteen million piastres, with which the tomb had been enriched by gifts from Moslems, many of these having been there for centuries.     The  Meccan Government has  issued  a notice  proclaiming Wejh open for commerce, on  condition that  all articles imported into or exported from it should  pass  through the  Customs  at Jiddah.  The Government is prepared to facilitate consignments and to offer the necessary guarantees for their safety.  Any goods, however, not passing through the Jiddah Customs are liable to confiscation.     Aziz Bey el-Masri, whose admitted political aspirations suited neither the views of the King of  the Hejaz nor of ourselves, has been removed from his command and has retired to his village in the Delta.  In  his place,  as  Minister of War, the  King has ap- pointed the  Egyptian  captain,  Mahmud  ei-Kaisuni,  formerly commandant of the garrison of Mecca.     We were informed from Rabugh,  under date February 25, that  Sherif  Ali had made  the following pronouncement  in reference   to  an  aeroplane  reconnaissance  of  Medina  itself. &quot; There is  no objection to a plane flying over the  environs  of the city and  taking photographs, provided it does not fly  over the city itself, photograph it or drop bombs into it.&quot;     In accordance  with this permission,  Major  Ross made  a flight with two planes on. March 5, from  the forward landing ground at  Mijz (occupied by Sherif Ali about February 24), to Medina, establishing on the  way the fact that Bir el-Mashi,  Bir Derwish, Bir  Ali, and the  roads connecting those  points  with Medina, were still held in force by the Turks.  Near Medina, the railway station (three miles  west), was visited,  and found to contain no engine, and only enough rolling stock to make up one short train.  Four hangars were located as well as an aerodrome, and three  enemy planes were seen in  the air.  Jebel  Ohod was found strongly fortified.     The population  of Medina is reported by spies to  be deeply disaffected  towards the Turks, and ready to turn on them  at thefirst opportunity.   On February 19,  a raiding party, sent  out from  Sherif  Zeid&apos;s  advanced  force at  Mijz,  reached a  point, called, variously,  el-Alaiun and el-Baitha, about  four-and-a-half miles from Medina,  and  captured  fifty camels and four  rifles,killing half-a-dozen Turkish soldiers.     The force of about 4,600  men now marching up the Sultaniroad with Sherif Ali consists of 1,500 troops, trained under Aziz el- Masri and now led by Syrian officers, 1,500 Bassam (Zahran) (?), 1,500 Beni Saad, 800 Beladiyah,  400 Meccans, 200 Bishawa, and250 Ateibah Camel Corps.   They have two 5-in.  B.L.  howitzers,
two 15-pounder Q.F. field-guns, three 2&apos;95 E.A. mountain-guns,one or  two Turkish  ditto, and  three 4-gun maxim batteries.Ahmed  Mansur, Emir of the Harb, has been left in command atRabugh with about 300 men.    From Sherifs Abdullah and Feisal come reports  (confirmed by other intelligence) of at least seven successful  raids  on  the hejaz railway.  The most northerly  attacks, south  of  Dar  el-Hamra  and near  Matalli station, were carried out  by one  ofFeisal&apos;s  detachments.   These resulted in a troop train being held up, one repair gang being captured, and one seriously knockedabout.   The line  remained  cut  for  at least forty-eight hours.Between Toweira  and Mudurij, about 200 miles  south  of this,a raid was  made which  will be  dealt  with in  detail  in  ournext issue, on the basis of Bimbashi G-arland&apos;s report.   Southagain of this, Abdullah reports several  demolitions, the most im-portant  of which,  resulting  in the capture of  the guard  of twenty-two  men  at the Wadi Hamdh bridge, north  of AbulNairn station, and the destruction of  the bridge itself, has been confirmed from another source.                          Yemen.                Letter from the Imam  Yahya.     The  letter which  follows  has  been received  by ColonelJacob.  It is remarkable for the comparative friendliness  of  itstone, and it argues that the Imam, who has said previously thathe could never desert the Turks, is hedging.  The motive prob-ably is trouble  with Zeidi  tribesmen and  merchants over  thecontinued  stoppage of trade.   Disturbances continue at  Radaa,Ibh  and Qatabah, and uneasiness about the state of Yemen  issaid to be increasing at Lahej.     &quot; Praise be to Cod the Compassionate and the Merciful.           &quot; Seal of Imam Yahya bin Hamid ed-Din.                              &quot; Dated Rabi withdrawal 8, 1335.                                 &quot; (i.e. December 1, 1916.)&quot; From         &quot;Imam Yahya bin Mohammed Hamid ed-Din of Yemen.&quot; To         &quot; Colonel Jacob,             &quot;Political Resident,  Aden.&quot; A.C.     &quot;  We  have received  your  letter dated el KPda 9, 1334,(September 7,  1916)  by the hand  of  Sheikh  Ahmed  HusidAlaui  and fully considered it.  You have known of the  regardwe have for the great British Government  as well as the  regardmaintained by our  ancestors  towards it.  You also know of the
fights  &quot;which took  place  in  Yemen  in  the past  between theespousers of our cause and the officials of the Ottoman Govern-ment, after which friendship  has been established between theOttoman Government and  us and  the  sanguinarj7 fights were caused to cease.     &quot;Then the general war-broke out  in parts of  the  world,during which time we have been true to our faith to them (Turks)and  meanwhile we have had regard for the British Government,and  kept aloof.     &quot; It was expected that the  magnanimous British Govern-ment would have kind consideration  for  the inhabitants of thiscountry who have suffered destruction in  the former  wars, andwould not shut the door  against their livelihood from the sea,though the product of their country might be sufficient to provide them with food  and other requirements.   The roads, however,have been  closed and the cold  shoulder turned to people whohave shown no hostile attitude towards the Government at all. Thebenefits of  the imports are derived by the sellers and buyers, and,the fight has no connection with  goods imported  to or exported from Yemen.  Anyhow,  we have  said all well  (i.e. raised noobjection).   But we  hope  that due consideration and justice willbe given to our representation as  behoves  Government.     &quot; As to the allusion to the agreement existent between ourancestors and the British Government in  the year  1821,  which you  have mentioned, we  inform  you that a long time has since then been passed, many changes and fearful events have occurredand  the  capital of  our  honourable Imaraate has likewise beentransferred ;  as  is not hidden, therefore  it is difficult to findtrace of the circumstance mentioned by you at our end at present.     &quot; If it be possible for you to send us a copy of the agree-ment, we shall consider the matter and let  you know after payingattention to it.   This will be better.   We crave help from Godand  that He will guide and lead us to the right path.  &quot; P.S.      The  aforesaid  Sheikh may be treated  as reliable by bothyou  and us.&quot;                        The Desert.              Movements in  East  and  Centre.     Telegrams from Basrah  show  us that  the ghazzu season issetting in with more than its customary  vigour, illustrating  thestatement made in our No. 35  (p.  541), that  the desert is inan  exceptionally  disturbed  condition  at  present.  At  least siximportant leaders  with  six tribal combinations  are  taking, or about to  take, the field.   They  may  be classed  as anti-Turk orpro-Turk, but, while their operations will  doubtless react uponourselves and our enemies, they are directed primarily against oneor more  of  the other Arab, leaders, being, as usual, internecine.
Though we may group  the  leaders by their sympathies, none,so far as we know at present, is definitely  allied  with another.Their  forces (not  necessarily  full  levies   of tribes)  are asfollows: /. Anti- Turk.1.  Saud Subhan    2. Nuri Shaalan    3. Ibn SaudIT.  Pro-Turk.    4. Fahad  Hadhdhal  Dhafir, under Hamud Suweit.

We are informed, further, that leader No. 1, after movingdown to el-Kra on the Suq esh-Shuyuk-Leinah road in order toget into touch with the  Zayyad  in force No. 5, has gone westtowards Jubbah ;  he hopes to reconcile and ally to himself leadersNos. 2 and 4.   The first of these  is at Zaatari in Wadi kharre, not far from the Hazil wells, which he now controls, to the disgustof his Sinjarah  contingent;  the  second is  in the  Batn  nearSubeikah.   No. 6 summoned to Ajfah, between  Shaibah wellsand Hail,  two important Abdah sheikhs, of  doubtful  loyalty tohim, viz.,  Aqab ibn Ajil  and Ibn Jabrin, as well as the Ajmanand  Firidah  chiefs specified above.  The  result was nil,  lbnRashid  refusing  Ibn  Ajil&apos;s  proposal  for an attack  on SaudSubhan.
     That the first three leaders, classed as anti-Turk, are in some sort of agreement, seems to follow from the presence, in each oftheir forces,  of elements  from  the  same main  group  of theShammar, the Sinjarah and the  Aslam  being both  constituentsof the Sayih section.   The Sinjarah. sheikhs were reported inour No. 35 (p. 542) to be desirous of co-operating with us.     All the three constituents of No. 1 have acted with us for ayear past, and their  present leader is both a rebel against IbnRashid, and a declared ally of King Husein of Hejaz.  The leader of force No. 2 is also the latter&apos;s armed ally, though it cannot besaid of him  equally  that  he has yet burned  his  boats, and  heseems to be aiming primarily at the control  of  all the Anezah.If Audah Abu  Tayi  is really  with Nuri  (as information  fromHejaz states), the latter has enlisted a very famous fighter,  who,again,  has subscribed to  King  Husein&apos;s cause.    About  ibn saud&apos;s intentions we can speak only with reserve.   He is  for us,and against  the Turk, and he has done nothing against KingHusein ; but that he  feels  jealousy  and  resentment  towards thelatter is notorious.  He has come to Qasim,  and will  probablyraid Jebel Shammar.     The ultimate aims of  the  three leaders  in  Class 2 are lesseasy to analyse.  Fahad Hadhdhal is  certainly at odds with NuriShaalan, but,  while he  has   professed  sympathy with KingHusein, he has done nothing,  so far as we  know,  to aid theTurks.   On the contrary, he ha.s written a friendly letter toSaud Subhan.  Ajeimi Saadun (though Sherif Feisal reckons him a friend in the future)  has  lately professed his fidelity to theOttoman  Caliph  in the  fine  reply to  Ibn  Saud, of  whichtranslation follows.  Letter from Ajeimi el-Mansur to Abdul Aziz ibn Saud,  dated            Rabi I. 17, 1335 [January 11, 1917.]&quot; A.C.     &quot;I have received your valued letter at a propitious hour withthe hand of friendship, and  have understood  all the friendlysentiments contained therein.     &quot; But  about your statement regarding your present efforts in making reference to the English in my absence, and of  theiracquiescence in  your  desires regarding myself, and your  asking for my  alliance with  you and agreement with you, and yoursaying that that will  uofc  be  possible without a meeting, andthat the object  thereof  is the preservation  of  the rights  of theArab race, and  that we have taken up an attitude of disaffectionwhich is baneful to the Arab race.     &quot; Oh, my  honoured  brother !   It is known co me and isbeyond doubt that my  attitude is the one which is necessary inorder to earn  the approval of  the  Most High God and theelevation of the name of the Arabs by the discharge of loyalty  :and what greater loyalty is there  than this, that I should carryout faithfully what God ordered me in His unchangeable book in
regard to Jihad against  non-believers, the enemies of God andof our religion.   The &quot; blame of the blamer &quot;  cannot apply  tome, who walk in the love of God and His prophet and of our country, and in the protection thereof from the  pollution of theInfidel.     &quot; I had great hope from your piety and jour Arab zeal thatyou  would approve my opinion and my action for the enhance-ment of the name of the Arabs in this my attitude :  and this isnot disaffection^ by the grace of God.  Rather,  it is a simpleattitude ; for if the Turkish  Government  be  a protection to thepurity of Islam, it is my help and the helper  of my  tribes withand  around me.  And  verily I am an absolute ruler by the orderof God  and the Government, and, according to my convictionand  belief, I am walking in the true path  which pleases God andthe Arab race with constant and unremitting attention, and that isthe spirit of  Islam.  This is the position, and I finish wdiat Ihave to say by quoting the word of God,  (who  has said) &quot;you cannot direct to the right path whom you like :  it is  God whodirects whom He wishes.&quot;     &quot; If I had given any promise to them in  the past or  after-wards, I. should have been bound to carry out my promise.  ButI  gave  undertaking for  the service of  my  religion and my government and  my  zeal,  and  it was incumbent on me  to actaccording to my real  honour, and therefore it  is not proper forme  to  release  myself from what  was  demanded by my saidreligion  and zeal and honour.  The great God is the  best  ofhelpers and co-operators, and if you argue  on the score  of religion,  then the discharge of my duty should  be according  tothe  promise which  I  previously gave to my Government, andthat  is the first attribute of the Arabs.     &quot; This is what had to be explained.                              &quot; (Signed) : Ajeimi Saadun.&quot;     Uncom-romising as this letter is, it  should be  discounted,perhaps, by the consideration that it is addressed to the Wahabite,Ibn  Saud,  who, as oppressor of the Ajman  (not to mentionother  ancestral causes of  difference),  probably  appeals  ill  toAjeimi.   The most obscure point, however, about this  Class isthe  actual relation of  Ajeimi  to  lbn Rashid.   The  latter hasshown considerable annoyance before  now about the enlistment of chiefs and  tribal  elements by  the  former,  which Ajeimiconsidered to be properly his own, and at  least one of the  chiefswho went to Ajfah,  viz., Aqab  Ibn Ajil,  has  been at odds withIbn  Rashid and a particular cause of dissension with  Ajeimi.The Ajman, again, since their expulsion from Hasa and  Koweit,have been rather Ajeimi&apos;s men than Ibn Rashid&apos;s.  Is Ibn Rasbidasserting himself against Ajeimi, and reclaiming the latter&apos;s chiefallies ?   If so, what will Ajeimi do, and will either turn against
the other and  the Turks ?  It is possible,  since  the  turkish troops, who were with Ajeimi, have retreated through Samawahtowards the north since the fall of Hut.  The presence of  Moham-med el-Firm at Ajfah, with these  companions, is not explicableby  anything we have  heard before.    He has acted with theconstituents of  force No. 1 for  several months, and it is difficultto believe he or his sub-tribe of the Harb  are  now, or  will  be,on the side of  Ibn Rashid,  King Husein&apos;s  avowed enemy.   Butthere  is no &quot; scrap  of  paper &quot;  quite  so scrappy  as a  Bedouinalliance, and we must be prepared for anything in the Desert.                          NOTES. Wadi  Hamdh.     The lower valley of Wadi Hamdh is a ten-mile wide depression.&quot;At 3 p.m.,&quot; writes Captain Lawrence, &quot;we entered the wadi itself.It proved to be an  immense bed  of  sandy hillocks a few feethigh, cut  up with shallow channels, which bore no signs of anygeneral seil, though evidently local showers  fill one or other  ofthem frequently.  Channels and  hillocks are  alike  overgrownwith the thickest growth of ethil and tarfa  imaginable.  It was difficult for  us to force our camels through in places.   The bedwas  in all about a mile wide, running from 100o E. to 300o W.,and we cut  across it obliquely  till 3.30 p.m.,  when we passed a water-pool about  eighty  yards long,  fifteen yards  wide, andtwo feet deep in a  clay bottom,  and 200 yards further  reachedthe bare flint ridge of the Billi bank of the wadi, which extends asan empty  plain to the abrupt foot of Jebel Raal, four or five miles away.  The pool of water is within  a few  yards  of the well  ofAbu Zereibat, and one or other of them affords water all the yearround.&quot;Wadi el-Ais.     Feisal said to Captain Lawrence that the road up Wadi Yamboto the railway at  Bowat Station was very  difficult  for loadedcamels.   There  is a road by Bowat  village to Wadi Ais, andanother from Kheif Hussein in Wadi Yambo  to Bir Fueis, by Rasel-Magrah, between Jebel Radhwah and Jebel Tareif, and thenceover a harrah to el-Ain, near Murabba in Wadi Ais.    Murabbalies a long day&apos;s journey from the railway, and is said to be thelast oasis in Wadi Ais.  The water springs and plantations endurefor a day&apos;s camel journey west of Murabba, and Wadi  Ais  itselffor another day after that, up to a high pass between Jebel Tubiand Jebel  Mertaba, a day from Wadi Girs and Um Lej.  Thesepasses (with Wadi Hamdh)  are  the only roads into  Wadi Ais,which is  bounded  on both sides  by difficult hills  and  harrahs.There are many springs and wells of water, but the groves arepoorer than  those of Wadi Yambo.
 Wadi  Aqiq.     Feisal told Captain  Lawrence that Wadi Aqiq, which risesbetween Lith and  Taif, and  flows through Tai , becomes WadiShaiba near the Harrat el-Muteir, and eventually flows betweenOhod and Medina,  as Wadi Aqiq, into the Wadi Hamdh.   As thecrowfly distance from beyond Taif to Medina is about 300 miles,this wadi, hitherto  unexplored, must be one  of the most importantchannels in Arabia. The Darb esh-Sharqi, from Mecca to Medina,is known  to cross it at Birkah, about 80 miles N.N.E. of Mecca:but, though this  road may hit  its course again  more than once,the  reports (e.g.  Burton&apos;s)  show that  it  does  not follow  thevalley continuously.   A  wadi of the same name reappears  justsouth-west of Medina, in accounts of pilgrim marches betweenMedina and Bir Abbas, and possibly this is the lower end of theoriginal Aqiq immediately before it loses  itself in  Wadi  Hamdh.The Capture of Eshref  Bey.     Eshref was met quite  by  accident  about 2  pun. in easycountry at a spot called Gambila, about six hours from  Kheibar,and was galloped down at once,  before  he could get  off morethan sixty or seventy rounds with his machine-gun.  The Arabslost four killed and four wounded, and captured the whole of his party.   He had with him letters to Ibn Rashid, Ibn Saud, and the yemen;   20,000  in  gold ; presents of  carpets  and clothes,  a machine-gun with  five spare barrels and 50,000 rounds, a box ofMauser pistols, etc.     Abdullah subsequently marched across the railway  betweenJedaha and Stabl Antar,  without seeing any enemy  patrols,  andhe left, between the metals, a letter to Fakhri with an account ofthe capture of Eshref.   His force  includes Muteir, Ateibah,Buqum,  and Anezah,  and he has  got in  a few Huteim mer-cenaries.    The force  left  at Henakiyah  is  about  300  strong.The desert seems in a very lively state, and nothing gets throughunplundered.  Nejd caravans are making for  Mecca  rather thanMedina, to avoid the danger zone.     Abdullah sent to Feisal Eshref&apos;s gaudy Medina-made daggeras a trophy (given subsequently  by  Feisal  to Colonel Wilson),and there was great  rejoicing  in   FeisaFs  army all  nignt.The H.Q. poet (also  chaplain, and as Muedhdhin,  waker-up-in-general to the force)  produced a  creditable ode in sixteen minutes.Fhe ode summed. up the  situation in favour of Abdullah,  but said that feisal&apos;s opportunities were coming.
