SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT, No. XI.                                     RUSSIA.    The position of the Russian Provisional Government  is still far  from reassuring.The general tone of the Press reports published in  this country has hitherto been far too optimistic.  The Provisional Government is still quite unable to control the spread of dangerous propaganda  by the Extremists, and though the most recent telegramsregarding the proclamation issued by -the  Soldiers&apos; and Officers&apos; Committee  is more hopeful, it is not possible to foresee an&apos; early restoration of essential discipline in theRussian navy, armies, or dep6ts.  The spread of revolutionary action to the Caucasusarmies is significant and most regrettable.    The report that the extreme pacifists are largely of Jewish extraction is importantif true.   In the first place, it might be possible for the influence  of the Zionists, parti-cularly in America (who now see that their cause is bound  up with  the success of theEntente arms)  to be brought to  bear  upon the  Russian  Jewish  societies, such  as thePoale Zionists, either through men like Tchlenoff and Ussichkin or through the OdessaCommittee.   On the other hand, the identification of the Jews with the Extremists islikely to produce a reaction on the part of many classes and grades of Russian society.    Revolutionary, if not  anarchic conditions still rule in Petrograd, that city of mixedraces and doubtful characters.   If only the  Provisional Government could  move itself and its officers to Moscow, where  Russian nationalism  is found  at its best, and wherePrince Lvoff has outstanding  personal  influence, matters might mend  rapidly.  at petrograd German influences can always operate, and the abolition of the police and state of the garrieon make it almost impossible for the Provisional Government to assertthemselves effectively.    The declarations of the Provisional  Government  regarding  the war and the allies are all that could be wished, but one wonders what w,ould be the effect on the mass ofthe Russian people and soldiers of any suggestion that Russia no longer meant to pressher claim for Constantinople.  The  surrender of this objective might very well have  adiscouraging effect upon important sections of the, community.    The weather conditions have  been such  that important military action by  theGermans on the Russian  front will  probably be delayed until  the last weeks in May,and mearjwhile conditions  in the army,  navy, and capital may  improve ; but whetherthey can improve sufficiently in  so  short a  time to  enable the  Russians  to  take the offensive, or even to resist effectively, is still doubtful.                              POLAND  AND FINLAND.    Both the telegrams are satisfactory.       [898-38]
                                     ARABIA.    The news from  Hejaz is undoubtedly good.  The  alternatives before Fakhreddinat Medina are either to allow himself to  be starved into capitulation or to withdraw.The latter would seem a desperate venture, harassed as he would  be by guerillas andunable to rely on getting through  on the railway even if sufficient trains were available.The latest destructions of railway are the most important yet reported.    The reinforcement of Faisal  by tribesmen from Jof and the north is very satis-factory as a sign of increasing Arab solidarity if one may for once use such a word in reference  to Bedouin Arabs-and of the strong  position of Nuri Shalan as againsthostile Anazeh on his north-east or Ibn Rashid  on the south.   The reported victory ofIbn Saud in  N.W.  Qasim  may have important bearings  on the Turkish  position atMedina, as the practical elimination of Ibn Rashicl would render it even more precarious.The Fuqara who have left Faisal are neither numerous nor important.                                      PERSIA..    In view of the internal conditions of  both Russia and  Persia  it would seem thatthe consideration of any new agreement regarding  the latter would  be premature.    The reflex of the Russian revolution  is bound to have a more than transient effecton those elements in Persia, whose creed is summed up in the  phrase &quot; Persia for the persians.&quot;                                                                      W.

The  Army. Colonel  Knox, military attache,  telegraphed  on  the  6th  April[No. 473] that  the  situation  in  Petrograd was not  improving, and that no sign ofasserting itself was  shown by the Provisional Government.   General  Korniloff  had expressed the opinion that if it did not act soon  it would be too late.  The bad spiritof the Petrograd troops was spreading to the front.   The insurgents  at Kronstadt  had declared that they, would not fire a shot against the enemy, and they had been advised to throw the breech-locks of the guns into the sea.  Colonel Knox said that he thought&apos;it was essential that the Russian Government should  be definitely asked whether itintended to continue the  war, as  the propaganda which it permitted was ruining  the morale of the army.   Three days later he telegraphed again  [No. 496], saying that hehad  told the Minister of  War that  the Russian army was  being  ruined by  Socialistpropaganda ; in reply he  acknowledged that the loss of discipline was very serious, but said that it was worse in  Petrograd  than  elsewhere.   The Minister was more worriedover the fall in production :  the factories in Petrograd only produced from 30 to 60 percent, of what they did before the revolution, and if some factories in other centres were doing better, it was only because the  wave  had not  yet reached them.  Even  theCouncil of Workmen  and  Soldiers&apos; Deputies was powerless to  contend with the extremeelement which  consisted of Jews and [?  imbeciles].  He agreed  that it would, sooner or later, come to a trial  of strength with the  extremists, but the Government had not yet       [898-38]                                                             B
the physical power on which it could depend ; the Council had the  key to  all govern-ment cyphers and the control of the wireless stations.  Colonel Knox also said that thetroops in Petrograd - were  entirely without discipline,  no officer dared  to give  apunishment;  also that the Soldiers&apos; Deputies in the  Council were  more advanced thanthe workmen.     The Navy. On the 4th April M. MiliukofF told Sir G. Buchanan that the Govern-ment had discussed the naval situation with the Committee of Soldiers and WorkmenDeputies, which, he was glad to say, had understood the gravity of the question  andhad recognised the necessity for allowing the officers to be reinstalled, and  replacingAdmiral MaximofT.  In  consequence, M. MiliukofF took a rather more hopeful view ofthe situation.     The naval attache  telegraphed  on the  9th April  [No.  493]  that Vice-AdmiralMaksimov, commanding the naval forces in the Baltic, who was thought to be a  betterpolitician than officer, had been given as his chief of staff Rear-Admiral Verdervski (tillthen commanding  the Baltic submarine flotillas), who had a good reputation as an  officer and had handled with discretion the situation at  Reval which had arisen out of therevolution.  The immediate efficiency of the  Baltic  fleet should be improved  by theappointment  of  Admiral  Verdervski, who was probably intended to succeed AdmiralMaksimov in command.     The Government and the Socialists.  Sir G. Buchanan telegi-aphed on the 9th April[No. 494] that, though the language  used by ministers  in conversation with him&apos; wasnot identical,  it was  clear that there had  been a sharp passage of arms between theGovernment and the committee on the subject of the war.  The committee had tried to force the Government to enter into  negotiations with the Allies with a view to bringabout peace, a proposal  which the Government refused to entertain.  M. Kerenski andM. MiliukofF, however, had both  informed him that a fresh declaration respecting thewar was under the consideration of the Cabinet and  would be published shortly ;  it was apparently to be couched in language calculated  to reassure the Pacificists that  russia would not wage a war of aggression.   Sir G. Buchanan believed that the Government,as a whole, was  sound on the question of the war, but it would not be master till it badput into its proper place the committee, which is  a self-constituted body, representing asmall body of extremists.   If the trial of strength  was fought out on the question ofwar or peace, the Government could count  upon the support of a majority both  in thearmy and the country.   The policy of the Government was to allow the committee todie a natural death rather than to suppress it.  What  really  preoccupied the Ambas-sadors was that both M. Miliukoff and  M. Kerensky underestimated the effect of the propaganda going on  in the army.     War Policy of the Government. On the 6th April M. MiliukofF gave an interviewto the press, in which he insisted on the identical views of the Allies  and the press ofthe  United States, except  as regards  peace without victory, which would mean thetriumph of German ideals.  He also laid down that : -     1.  Annexation by the Allies could only be given up  so far as it was usurpation.     2.  Neutralisation of the Straits would not safeguard Russian interests.     -3.  Europe must be put on an ethnographical bas;s.  [Petrograd telegram No. 475.]     This was  bitterly attacked by the labour press,  and he  had  been accused ofadvocating a war  of conquest.  And on the 8th April one of the labour papers published a statement by M. Kereuski to the effect that  M. Miliukoff had not spoken in the nameof the Government. When asked by Sir G. Buohanan why he had done this, he repliedthat he  had done  it because M. MiliukofI had spoken without consulting his colleagues,and  his declaration  had placed  the  Government in a very difficult position [No. 489].He also said that  Russia was in favour of a  war of defence  as  opposed to one of aggression.  Sir G. Buchanan told  him that the question whether effect was or was notto  be given to the Constantinople agreement was Russia&apos;s affair [No. 494].     Munitions from Japan. Sir C.  Greene telegraphed from Tokio on the 7th April[No. 244] that the new Russian Minister of War had definitely agreed to accept  fifteen[? sixteen] howitzers, to  be delivered within  a month, together  with  500  rounds perpiece and two waggons with all the necessary harness ; and thereafter  400  rounds perpiece monthly.  None of the remaining  .100 pieces offered by the Japanese Government
had been accepted, and no personnel would be sent.   The Russian military attache&apos;  had also been offered 150,000 rifles, and had accepted them conditionally on the flotation ofthe loan, which had been pending for a long time.    The Attitude of England. Sir  G.  Buchanan  telegraphed  on  the  0th April[No.  494] that in the  course of conversation M. Kerenski  had stated that  there  wasa strong feeling  in Russia  that England  was treating  the new  Government withcoldness  and that this  attitude had increased its difficulties and he regretted that wehad allowed America  to be  the first  to recognise  it.  The  Ambassador  told  him inreply that he had been authorised to recognise the  new Government a week before hisAmerican colleague, but had had to wait for the French  and Italian  Ambassadors with whom  he had to act in  concert ; and  as a matter  of fact they had announced  the recognition only half an  hoar  after the  American Ambassador.   M. Kerenski in an earlier  conversation had hinted that public  opinion  in Russia was somewhat hurt bythe&apos; un-expansiveness of  British  sympathy- ; in regard to which Sir G.  Buchanansuggested [No. 468] that it  might be  well for  sympathetic telegrams  to  be sent byprominent individuals and bodies,  e.g.,  by Sir  D.  Haig to General  Alexieff,  by  theemployes at Woolwich arsenal to  the  workmen  at the Petrograd gun and cartridgefactories, by the employes of Messrs. Vickers to the men  at the  Potiloff works bythe Miners&apos; Federation to  the coal  workers of the Donetz  region, and by the RailwayUnion  to the Russian  railway  employes zhe  two last  through the President  of theCouncil of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies.    Proposed Anglo-Pussian Agreement in  regard  to Military Service. The ForeignOffice telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan on  the 5th April [No. 653]  saying  that  thoughit  was  not  desired  to insist on  the actual  terms of  the draft agreement of Januarylast [Eastern Report 1, p.  1], it was wished that the Provisional  Government should agree to the principle that Russian  subjects resident  in  Great Britain  and  Britishsubjects resident in Russia  should be  compelled to take service in the army of  thecountry in. which  they&apos;were residing, unless they should return to their own country.If the Provisional Government would agree to this, it might either abide by the original draft agreement or a fresh one would be submitted for their concurrence.    The Emperor. Sir  G.  Buchanan telegraphed on  the 4th April [No.  461]  thatthe Military Attache had been informed by M. Kerenski that the, information given byM. Miliukoff in regard to the removal  of the  Emperor  from Tsarskoe Selo I EasternReport X, p. 2] was not correct.   He himself had gone  to Tsarskoe  Selo, and&quot; findingthat the measures taken for guarding him were quite satisfactory, had settled that theEmperor should  remain there.  Two  of  the  grand  duchesses were still ill, but  theEmperor and. the Tsarevitch with both  in  very good health.                                   FINLAND.    Effect of the Russian Promises.  Sir G. Buchanan  telegraphed on the  4th April[No.  460] that  his. information went to-show  that  the  concessions  made by RussianGovernment seemed to have been received with unmixed satisfaction and  that therewere no signs of any demand for complete independence or fear that conscription wouldbe introduced unless it were done by the Finnish Diet itself. &apos;,,                                   POLAND.    The Military Question. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed from Berne on  the 4th April[No.  280] that news just received from  Poland showed  that even before the issue ofthe Russian proclamation t&quot; the Poles the question of a Polish army which would fightby the side of the Central Empires had lost  all practical  significance, and that since theissue of the manifesto the  danger of the military question in Poland might be  considered as definitely at an end.  The  Poles were afraid, now  that  the spring had  come,  thatworkmen, and especially agricultural labourers, would  be sent to  Germany.  They  alsoexpected political reprisals on a large scale.  There Were already rumours  of numerousarrests at Warsaw among workmen.                                  RUMANIA.    Proposed  Evacuation of the Army. In  rep^y to  his  telegram [No. 114] of the22nd March [Eastern  Report IX, p. 5],  the Foreign Office telegraphed to Sir G. Barclay
on the 4th April [No. 114] informing him that the general staff adhered to its formerview, which was based on the advice  of Generals Alexieff, Sakharoff, and Prezan.  in answer, Sir G. Barclay said [No. 178] that there must be a misunderstanding, and onewhich he thought should be  traced  to its source.  General  Prezan certainly did notsend  such  advice through the Military Attache, whom he  had just informed that hewas  more  than ever opposed, in  view of the  political situation in  Bussia, to theevacuation of any troops other than the cavalry divisions, to the evacuation of whichhe had, with reluctance, consented, on account of the lack of forage.   Sir G. Barclay-had been unable to get any information from local sources that any good military opinion there was in favour of evacuation.                                  ABYSSINIA.    Envoy from the King of Ilejaz. Mr. Thesiger in a despatch to Sir R. Wingate(dated 27th February) said that the stay of Sayed Abbas Melki  (the representative of king Hussain  at  the coronation of the&apos; Empress of Abyssinia) had  certainly beenproductive of good, as his  views  had done  much to  counterbalance the reports whichthe Turks had spread that Mecca was in their  hands ;  by explaining the reasons for therevolt, he  had, too, certainly confirmed  the better class Arabs  and Indians in their approval of the Sherifs action, and had drawn over many who were inclined to waver.    The Aeroplanes. Mr.  Thesiger  telegraphed on the 3rd April [No. 27] saying thatthe aeroplanes for demonstration purposes were no longer required.                                    ARABIA.PIEJAZ.    Operations.- The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 2nd April that  he hadreceived  a  message from  H.M.S.  &quot; Minto &quot; that Kunfida (Comfida) was deserted, andthat the Turks were at Goz ; Nasir of  Lith  had left to raise an Arab army to attack the Turks at Goz.    Sir R. Wingate or the Arab Bureau telegraphed as follows :     1. April 4 : The station  at Abu Nairn had been destroyed and a train of  seven           waggons  wrecked  by an Arab  force ;  forty  Turks  had  been  killed           [A.B. 205].    2. April 5 : It  had  been reported  by Abdulla  that some  important  Shammar           shaykhs  had come to  his camp  and had  declared their loyalty to  King           Hussain [A.B. 212].    3. April 8 : Information had  been  received from  a  reliable source that Warm           Nashi  was  being continually attacked,  and  was  suffering  serious  loss,           especially in artillerymen, which the Turks could not make good [A.B. 239],    Proclamation by the King. On the 6th April Sir R. Wingate telegraphed that animportant  proclamation of King  Plussain w7as reproduced in the &quot; Kibla &quot; of the 5thMarch.   The King called the attention of Moslems to the atrocities recently committed by the Turks at Medina, and said that if the Moslems of Turkey  did not repudiate theaction of their  &quot; Turanian &quot; Government, he would suppress the name of the  Sultan  ofTurkey from the  prayers in the mosque at Mecca.  The King had asked for our assist-ance  in  circulating the  proclamation  in  Syria and  Mesopotamia,  and  he (Sir R.Wingate)  was  trying to obtain additional  copies of the issue of the &quot; Kibla &quot; for thatpurpose.    King Hussain s Subsidy. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 4th April  [No. 368]that  King Hussain  was  pressing for an  increase to  his monthly subsidy,  and for additional  moneys and foodstuffs for the supply of northern tribes, as to which he wouldtelegraph again as soon as  he had received  particulars from  Hejaz on which he  couldbase a recommendation.     French Wireless Set. In the same telegram [No.  368]  Sir R. Wingate said thatit was possible  he might have to ask the French  to transfer  their wireless set,  then  atSuez, to Yambo, for which place no British wireless was available.     Colonel Bremond. In reply to Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram [No. 325], Sir R. Wingatesaid  [No.  368] that the chief reason for which  he had hitherto refrained from repre-
seating- strongly that Colonel BrenioncTs activities had frequently extended beyond thescope of his military mission was that they had been so signally barren of result.  KingHussain had  repeatedly, and in writing, affirmed his desire to negotiate only throughus with France or  other Allied  Power, and his attitude of amused suspicion had been shown in his invariably  polite and non-committal replies to Colonel Bremond&apos;s offersand  suggestions, of which the  King had kept Colonel Wilson fully informed.  In theevent of the  Turks evacuating Medina, Sir R. Wingate had intended to press for  thewithdrawal of the  French Military Mission,  [f required, a French liaison officer couldbe attached to Colonel Wilson&apos;s  staff at Jeddah.ADEN.    Musemir. The G.O.C. telegraphed  on 5th April [No. 583] that it  was reportedthat a column of some 150 Turks and Arabs had arrived at this place for the arrest ofthe Sultan Ali Bin Ahmed  who had sent a message asking  for assistance by sea and land : and again on the following day [No.  589] that, according to reports received, theenemy party, possibly owing to  the  arrival of H.M.S. &quot; Sapphire,&quot; had moved north toObar Asshaba, probably to promote Turkish intrigue in that  direction.   The G.O.C.said that the Fadli Sultan was at the bottom of the trouble and he was putting political pressure on him.   On the 7th telegraphing again [No.  596] he said that reports indicated a proposed stay in Abyan by the Turkish  party, and  on the 9th  [No. 601] that theywere furnishing  reports to  the same effect, the  camp being  formed 3 miles north ofMusemir.    The Yusufiyin. In his telegram of  6th April TNo.  589] the G.O.C.  said that hewas giving the Yusufiyin some encouragement with money and arms ; he regarded the disturbances which the Turks had to  meet as signs of increasing Arab hostility.JEBEL SHAMMAR.    Action against Ibn Rashid. The Arab Bureau telegraphed on 7th April [A.B. 231]that Basra  had reported news  brought from  Ibn  Saud  by a messenger that SaudSubhan had defeated some outlying Shammar Abdah, near Linah.  Huteim Harb hadbeen attacked by Ibn  Rashid north-west (?) of Qasim but he had been worsted and hadfled .to Hail, leaving  some tribesmen  cut  off at  Mustajiddah  with the brother ofIbn Saud, Mutair.  Mohammed,  cutting off conrmunications with  Medina.  A Turkisharmy  from the east was threatened by Ibn Saud from Bureidah, Ibn  Bashid not daringto issue from Hail :  he  had 200  Turkish gunners  and Ali Ajman  with ham.  ibn saud  would  keep  Ibn Rashid  pinned down in the town  but  probably would  not attack it.                                    PERSIA.     Proposed new Anglo-Russian Agreement. -Sir  G. Buchanan  telegraphed  fromPetrograd on the 9th April [No. 495] that he had received a visit  from the RussianMinister at Tehran, who had suggested that the present was a favourable moment  for negotiating a new agreement about Persia, and that it was very desirable that such anagreement  should  be concluded  before  the  end  of the war.   The  sympathies ofthe Provisional Government, he said, were entirely on the side  of the maintenance of persian  independence,  and all idea of  converting Northern I Persia into a Russianprovince had been abandoned ; the delimitation of our respective spheres of influenceought to follow ethnographical and geographical lines.     Sir G. Buchanan repeated the substance of the conversation  to M. Miliukoff, whoexpressed himself in entire accord with the Russian Ministers suggestion, and said thathe thought it would be an excellent thing if our  two  Ministers could draw up a draft agreement for discussion between  the two  Governments.  One matter  winch ratherpreoccupied him was the attitude that the enquiry should adopt towards any movementin Persia.     The Russian Minister expected to return to Tehran in about a fortnight. &apos;     Bunder  Abbas-Kerman Telegraph  Line. The Viceroy  telegraphed on  the 30thMarch that, the line had reached Kalehiasqar, a distance of 206J miles.       [898-38]                                                         O
                                AFGHANISTAN.     Nasrulla Deprived  of  Office. It appears that the Amir has deprived Nasrulla ofhis office of Minister in charge of Afghan relations with the independent tribes, but itis not known who has succeeded hirn.     German Party. Reports point to the strict guarding of the German party  andits  isolation from any  intercourse   with  the  people.   Wagner  is reported  to  beattempting to get into touch with prisoners of war in Russian Turkestan.ADDENDA.                                     RUSSIA.     Policy of the Government. The Provisional Government, on the 9th  April, issued a proclamation in which, after declaring that  the  vital problem of the army was thedefence at all costs of the national inheritance  and  the release of the country from theenemy.  It said that the aim of freed Russia was not dominion over other nations, orthe  taking from them their national  inheritance, or the  seizure by  force of foreignterritory, but the &quot; confirmation of lasting peace on the basis of the desires of peoples.&quot;It also declared that the State was in danger, and that it was necessary &quot; to harnessall available strength for its rescue.&quot;   (&quot;Petrograd telegram No.  501.]     Declaration  issued by the Petrograd Garrison. This declaration, diaAvn up  by officers and men, emphasizes  the necessity for continuing the war until the new-wonfreedom  has been secured.   The war must lie fought to a successful  end.   The com-mittee of working men and soldiers is called  upon  to &quot;unite into all  Russian councilto guard the interests of the people,&quot; and report  to the Provisional  Government allacts injuring those interests ;  the committee  should make its demands only through theProvisional Government, as the sole  organ of State  authority;  and the  committee isfurther called upon to end  all quarrels between workmen  and technical  staffs of the petrograd factories, which  were causing incalculable harm to the army, and to increasethe munitions output the eight-hours&apos; day must  be suspended and work be  continuedunceasingly at the  highest pressure.  Another resolution called on soldiers to revert tothe strictest  discipline, and to make themselves efficient; the men  being reminded thatstrict obedience to  leaders was absolutely essential.  [No. 504.]     Cronstadt. The  naval  attache  telegraphed,   on the   11th April [No.  510],that M.  Kerensky  had informed him that  the general oondition continued to tendtowards  improvement, and that  the  factories were working there  with  a  normaloutput.                                    FINLAND.     The Diet.-Sir G. Buchanan  telegraphed [No.  507]  on the  11th April that theFinnish Diet opened that day.                                    POLAND.     Independence. Mr. Balfour telegraphed  to Sir G. Buchanan on the  5th April[No. 643]  instructing him to congratulate  the Russian Government  on its generousaction, and to say that His Majesty&apos;s  Government was  happy  to give  its completeadherence  to the principle of a united and independent Poland, and was ready to make every effort, in unison with Russia, to secure its attainment.ABYSSINIA.     Mr.  Thesiger, in  his despatch [No. 8] of the 27th February, says that shortly afterthe coronation of the  Empress Zauditu on the  11th February four of the  provinces ofNegus Waldo Giorgis broke out into  revolt, and the Moslems of Wollo, driven by theexactions and brutality of the Shoan army, attacked Dessie, and though  heavily defeatedhave continued to raid Abyssinian districts.  At the same  time there occurred a rising
PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OJTICSi BT G. R. HARRISON.  13/4/1917. of  the  Moslem and  Pagan tribes from  Ginir. in Arussi to Dolo on  the British East African frontier.   These uprisings appear to have their origin in local circumstances, and are neither directed against Ras Taflari nor in favour of Lij Yasu.     No amelioration of the situation is to be expected.  Ras Taffari has no real power;. behind  him is the Empress, who is seeking to assert herself, and  behind both are the Council of Ministers, mainly preoccupied in the maintenance of their power individually, by playing the Ras and the Empress off against each other and by intriguing on all sides.   The soldiers are discontented, and the lesser officers impoverished by their long absence from their homes, and it is  doubtful whether they would undertake  a fresh campaign if they were  called upon to do so.   Yet while Lij Yasu, who is  still holding out at Magdala, remains at large the provincial armies cannot be dismissed.     Ras Taffari appears to doubt his own ability to  deal  with  this situation, and it is Mr. Thesiger&apos;s opinion that possibly he contemplates asking for the establishment of a British protectorate, though it is improbable that he could, as yet, obtain the support- of a majority of his people to such a course.                                    ARABIA. HEJAZ.     Operations. The  Arab Bureau  telegraphed on  the 9th April TA.B.  252] that Captain Lawrence had reported  that three  aeroplanes had been burned  as useless in Medina.  Bails had been removed from sidings to repair main line.  Plenty of telegraph material at Tebuk.   Jemal the Less at  Medain.  All stations from Medain to Tebuk had been  reinforced.    Sherif Ali  Haidax  was  reported  to have  returned to Syria about  the 7th March.   Newcombe reported on  the  3rd April that  the Fuqara had ceased to help,  but the Moahib had remained faithful.  Audah Tayyi, chief of Huweitat, went to Wej to see Eaisal.  Line-cutting  was very easy, but bombs were  searched for systematically and removed; therefore recently no trains had been caught.     And again, on the  fOth April [A.B. 255], that a messenger had reported to King Hussain that  Fakhreddin  Pasha  had been  called upon by Sherif  Ali to  surrender Medina, and had asked  for a three days&apos; armistice, which was refused.     On the 11th April  Sir R. Wingate telegraphed [A.B. 266] that Faisal had reportedthat a party of his troops had destroyed for the distance of  1,200 metres the  line north of Medain Saleh, and that  another party had blown up a culvert near Abu  take.

ARABIA.                            Hejaz.                          Intelligence.      Major  Joyce sends  the  following report on his visit  to Bir  Derwisb :       &quot;Sherif  Ali  has  divided  his force  into   two  sections; himself and his  Bedouins, who  he states  are 1.0,000  (but  I estimate them at about 5,000) occupy the hills and open  ground south-west of the big well at Bir Derwish.   His  Meccan levies hold the hills  just above  his camp and. have  regular  outposts stationed  on  the tops.   The  Bedouins also  hold hills to   the north-east of  the Wadi Freish  in  the  direction of the Turkish positions at  Jelajila, about eight miles  to the  north-east on  the Sultani  road,   it is  possible,  therefore, that  the numbers of Bedouins are  greater than  \  estimate, owing to  their  wide distribution.      &quot;The trained army and artillery are camped about one-and- a-half miles north-west, of Bir Derwish.  They hold a  regular line  of outposts,  with guns  arid  maxims  in position.  They have their  own ration  and ammunition dump, and apparently Sherif  Ali gives  them a free hand as regards interior  economy, mei-ely telling off 1,200 camels to bring their requirements from Yambo.   The  result is satisfactory  and there  appear to be discipline  and  system in  their  arrangements.  Their animals look fit and  well  cared  for,  and  they  have  lost only four Australian horses in the four months&apos; operations from Rabegh.     &quot;Jauder  Fffendi  commands  in  the  absence  of  Nuri  Bey and informs me their numbers are 1,800, oi  which 1,500  might be considered effective.  I.  spent a whole morning  at their camp and took a note of their immediate requirements,   which appear very reasonable considering the length  of time they have been in the field.     &quot;Their  artillery  and machine  guns are all in good  order, and there is  apparently a marked improvement in  their handling of  the artillery, and  they  are satisfied,  with  the effectiveness of their guns.     &quot; The taking of  Medina  is  undoubtedly Sherif Ali&apos;s  one aim and objective, and  he practically  admitted that when this was achieved his part  in active operations would come to an end. I  suggested  that  his  Bedouins had not been as active  as might be  expected, thinking:&apos;  possibly that,   when Medina fell, their sources of pay and  supplies might either cease  or  be greatly reduced.  Sherif Ali assured me that  this was not  so, but  on the contrary they were more loyal, and  united  than at  any time since the Revolt  broke out.  This  I  believe is  so,  and their general  attitude and  discipline appeared far better than when I was in touch with them at  Rabegh:   Towards myself, certainlythey were much more  friendly and less suspicious.
     &quot; Sherif Ali&apos;s next offensive will be directed against Jelajila,where there is an abundant water supply, and, if the surroundinghills can   be occupied,  the  Turks&apos;  communications  betweenMedina and Bir el-Mashi can be seriously  threatened by raidingparties.   It is reported to be held by one  battery of Turks, anda recent reconnaissance discovered at least  two gun positions.     &quot; The impression deiived from my   visit to  Sherif Ali  isthat he shows great improvement in organisation.   His arrange-ments  for supplies and  transport  appear  good  and  there  isorganisation  and system.  This  is  probably greatly assisted bythe presence of  two responsible  persons at Yambo, viz., SheikhAbdel Qadir and Yuzb. Abdel Latif Kamel.     &quot;What is greatly required  is a G.O.C.  to make proper useof the forces at Sherif Ali&apos;s disposal.   With the best intentions in the world, he  is incapable of commanding troops,  owing  toentire  lack  of military knowledge.   He changes his  mind andalters his plans from day to day ; consequently  long periods  ofinactivity occur  when  undoubtedly much might be done  by strongreconnaissance and constantly   worrying the  Turks  with  hismachine  and mountain  guns.   His  presence   is  essential  tokeep together  the Bedouin tribes ; but unless   a  competentcommander takes over charge of the operations, it  appears to mevery doubtful  if   any  important  military success  will   beobtained.   Colonel Cadi is  at present  with  Sherif Ali in  the capacity of adviser and this may bring about some better results.     &quot; I questioned Sherif  Ali  closely re  his Syrian officers and troops and he expressed  himself entirely  satisfied with them inevery  way, with the exception  of  two  of  them who had beensent to Mecca as their conduct had not been entirely satisfactory.Though  he  would  never  acknowledge  it,  I do   not  considerSherif  Ali really possesses  a very strong hold over these Syrianofficers, and the part  they  take in  operations is arranged  moreby themselves than by Sherif Ali.   Their  inactivity  since  theaction at  Bir el-Mashi is most probably  due to their own lackof  enterprise and  the  fact  that Sherif   Ali has  not  sufficientcontrol to supplement it.     &quot; Sherif Ali and the other  Ashraf I  met were most cordialin their relations with me while I was in his camp.  Ho british officer  had previously been in as far as  Bir Derwish  and a few-months ago  it  would  have been  absolutely forbidden.   The Sheikhs  1 travelled  with   were most open and friendly andtreated me more as an ally  than as a unit  to be conveyed by  the Sherifs order.  It seems possible that in. time- British officersmight be allowed to co-operate in an executive capacity in this area, but the old prejudices are- slow in changing.&quot;     The following notes were   collected  from  refugees on  theroad between Yambo and Bir Derwish by  Major Joyce and sentto Cairo on June 11:       &quot; The Turks have now ordered the deportation of practically&quot;the whole civilian population of Medina.   Formerly  the idea
was for these to be sent north to Syria, but  as  rations becamescarce  and  the railway  interrupted, orders  were  issued  for civilians to leave in any direction.   The upper classes and richmerchants left some months ago  for the north.   The majorityof the poorer classes take refuge in the camps of  Sherif Ali andSherif  Zeid, but a  fairly large number have gone  to  Hail.  Outof a population of  about 25,000,  only 3,000 or 4,000 are  now reported to  be remaining  in  Medina, and many  of these  are merely  waiting transport to take themselves and their familiesaway.   About 2,000 of  these  refugees  were actually in  SherifAli&apos;s camp  when  I visited  Bir Derwish  and I passed  manycaravans on the  road.  .  Native carts  and  porters  bring  the refugees and their baggage (of  which  there  is a  considerableamount) to  about  two miles outside the city, where it is dumpedand the unfortunate people are left to arrange with the Bedouinsas best  they can to  procure camels  to take  them  on.   these arrangements  are  usually  made  at night, and  apparently  theTurks do not interfere,  or endeavour  to seize the camels brought by the Bedouins.  The  refugees are allowed to take away only avery small&apos; quantity  of foodstuffs  and naturally suffer  manyhardships, though  I saw no case of actual  emaciation  or  want.The feeling of these refugees  against the  Turks  is  very  bitterand numerous imprecations are showered on their heads and  onFakhri  Pasha  especially.   All  houses and property had  to  be abandoned, and in many cases the former were broken into and -all available wood, etc., was stolen.    &quot;All foodstuffs are now under direct  control of the militaryand there are reported to be large stocks of barley, rice, burghul,semin and lentils actually  in the city.   In  spite of  this,  only&apos;half-rations  are issued to the  troops and  issues  of  camel meatare irregular.   Civilians are allowed no meat.   An extension ofthe railway  has been made and it now runs from the old  stationthrough the city up to the citadel near  the Bab el-Sham. -  no compensation was  given for buildings knocked down to clear theway for this extension.  The three main storehouses in Medina areone at the old railway station, one in the Haram  enclosure, andone at the citadel.   A pump has been erected in the  well in thecourtyard of the Haram and the buildings  themselves have  beenfortified with sand-bags and protected with machine guns.    &quot; Very few soldiers are reported in  Medina itself, but  acoffee-seller  reports very strong entrenchments on Jebel Ohod,Jebel Arsi and at Jemma ; he  states the majority of the soldiersare outside Medina itself.    &quot; The   Egyptian Tekia buildings  have been  turned intoofficers  quarters, about forty  to fifty officers  occupy  it.   the clerk himself was invited to go to Syria, but preferred to returnto Egypt to collect his arrears of pay.    &quot; Fakhri Pasha evidently rules Medina with  much severityand it is chiefly due to him that the discontented army is kepttogether.  There are very  few Arab officers or  soldiers left  in
Medina, most having been sent to Syria or having deserted  tothe Sherif.     Col.  Newcouibe  reports  that eight  mines about  two feetdiameter were  picked  up  by  the Arabs  (Sheikh  Hannul)  atMagana, in the Gulf of Akaba, and  brought  to  Dhaba about  amonth ago.   The mines are now to be seen at JDhaba  and  it isstated that  the Turks  brought them  to  Magana  about  threemonths ago, but did not utilize them.     About June J, some thirty Ageyl reached Wejb, r/w JJhaba,from Akaba,  having deserted from the  Turks.   They  say  that another sixty Ageyl are still  with  the, Turks,  ready to  desert.Akaba is unoccupied, but patrolled ; also the coast is patrolled forsome ten miles, either way.     &quot;The strength of  the Turkish forces  between Maau andAkaba is about one and a half battalions.&quot;                       Motor Car Rims. (a)  Wejh to Jeyadah.     The  following Route Report has been supplied by Capt. F. VV. Stent, RFC. :-     &quot; June 4, 1917:  One R.F.C. car,one armoured car (stripped) and  one  Ford  car  left Wejh  at  3.30 p.in.   We followed the Khauthla route  for about twelve miles,  when we branched  off to the east and ran over foothills in a/n easterly direction on  very well marked camel  tracks, till we got to Wadi Maara at 5.40 p.rn. From here we went north-east to Abu  Ajaj, which we reached at 6.40 p.m. and camped for the night.  There were several wells here, of which only two were good, and all the going up to  this point Avas very easy for cars.     &quot; June 6, 1917.  We left our camp at 4.45 a.in. and  ran in a fairly straight line to  a point about six miles north of Khauthla in  a  wadi of that name  which runs  north   and  south just here between the two Jebels Khashub.   We turned into it and ran north to Khorba (with a stop  of an hour and a half),  which we reached at 10 a.m.  The going  was beginning to be rather bad here,  and as the Rolls-Royce  was rather short of spare tyres we decided to leave it and the Ford and go on  with  the R.F.C. tender.  The water at Khorba was A7ery good  and there  was plenty of it.   We started  again at  10.35 a.HI.  and ran  slightly west of north for about seven miles, skirting Jebel Shaihub on  our  right till  we got to the end of it, when  we turned  sharply  to  the  right into Wadi Kharrar, again skirting J.  Shaihub and running east-south- east for about ten miles ; all of which was  very rough and stony. Here  the wadi  turns  north-east  (el-Kharra)  and runs up  toa narrow gorge in which there is much  running water.  We got
here at 1.45 p.m., but found  it  impossible  to  get any  furtherowing to the steps in the rock.   .  &quot; Total run  about ninety miles  in  ten  hours.  I inspectedthe pass and found that there were three steps  which could  bemade passable  with very little work, and  I.  think  guns could behand-hauled over them as they are.     &quot; I also walked to Jeyadah (about two miles), where 1. founda very suitable place for an aerodrome, which only needs a littleclearing.   We  started  back again the same day, and after pickingup the armoured-car.and the  Ford,  reached  Wejh  at  1.30 pan.on  June,  fi,  having accomplished the  return  journey in sevenhours.&quot;(/;)  Yamho to Bir Derioish.     Major Joyce sends the following under  date June 12 :      &quot; Capt. Stenfc, R.F.C., and myself, arrived  at Yambo   onMay 21, and disembarked with the Orossley  tender  on  which  there connaissance was to be attempted.   Mo letter was received fromSherif Ali  sanctioning the reconnaissance, but  approval had. beenobtained from  Mecca, and it was decided, therefore, not to awaitreceipt of the letter from Sherif Ali.     &quot;Sheikh  Abdel Qadir at first  volunteered  to  proceed with.us and aet as guide,  but  decided  later  lie was  too  busy, andproduced in his place Sheikh  And Mi rank of:  the Harb tribe, whoturned out a satisfactory and reliable guide.  The routes werethoroughly discussed before starting ; the two likely ones beingone via Bir Said, and the other via Bedr Honein and Wadi Safra.It was decided, to attempt the Bir Said route first,  as being themore direct one, and also the Mahmal route (which  meant that  an enormous  amount of  traffic  passed along  it).   Camels  were despatched by  Sheikh  Abdel Qadir to follow  the car tracks in theevent of a  breakdown.     &quot;A start was made at  3.15 p.m.  on  May  22,  and  someforty-five miles  were  covered  before halting for  the night  atKashm.  Burweith, about four-  miles west of Bir  Said.   The roadwas&quot;  generally  good, except for about half-a-inile  of  deep sandmet with on entering the foothills at Fageish.   The  car puncturedonce on this stretch of road.  On the morning  of  the  22nd,  weproceeded via  Bir Said and Wadi was it  up  to about one-and-a-half  miles from the Difran Pass, when the road ascends to a neckin the  hills, and  thence leads on  to  Hamra.   Here the roadbecame  very rough and  large  stones made the going difficult.Capt. Stent and myself made a reconnaissance of the road up  tothe pass and found it, in its present state, quite  impossible  formotor traffic.   A narrow  path had  been cleared by the Turks,but it would probably  take a  hundred  men  ten to  fifteen days&apos;work before the track could be widened  sufficiently and the largeboulders removed.
     &quot; Finding this route impracticable, we  decided to  return  toBir Said and from there endeavour to get across the country  toBedr Honein and into the  Wadi  Safra.  This was  successfullyaccomplished and  we  entered  the Wadi Safra about three miles south-west of  Bedr.    Some very soft  sand  was  encounteredshortly after getting into the wadi and the car stuck several times ;but with this exception we proceeded up the wadi without much difficulty, though the going was very rough ; and eventually wehalted at Wasta for the night.  On the morning of the 24th, weproceeded up the wadi to Um Diyal, a village with palm trees,about one mile west of  Kheif.  Here the road became  very bad,and  after inspecting  it  on  foot  Capt.  Stent decided that it was impracticable  to proceed  further,  and to  attempt  it  wouldprobably involve the loss of the ca,r (I calculate fifty men could make this bit of road  passable in  one clay.)   We accordinglyreturned to  Hamra, in which stretch of about eleven  miles wehad  four punctures, and there awaited the  arrival  of the camelswhich had been sent out to follow our tracks.  These arrived  onthe morning of the 24th ; accordingly on the morning of the 25th,Capt. Stent and the Crossley tender, with two guides, returned toYambo  and I proceeded on camels  to  Bir Derwish.   The roadeast  of  Kheif  for about eight miles would require working on ifcars  were to use it to  any extent ; it would only be just passablein its present state.  From Bir Abbas to  Bir Derwish the roadis excellent.     &quot; The result of the reconnaissance is therefore :      &quot;(1) That cars can be got as far as Um Diyal, and  with asmall amount oE work,  could, in my opinion,  be  got up to BirDerwish.     &quot;(2) That without a considerable amount of work the roadcould not be used to  any extent&apos;by motor  transport,  and  thewear and tear on tyres  would be  very great.&quot;                         SYRIA.                      Jebel Nuseiriya.li.    The  following  extracts are taken from  a valuable  report prepared by Pcre J.  Jaussen and communicated by the  &quot;Bureaudes Renseignements, Division de  Syrie,&quot;  in  November, 1916.The full report contains also a list of administrative  districts,statistics of villages, and notes on personalities.  A ma,):) wasalso appended : Population.    &quot; The mountainous region  bounded  on  the south by theNahr  el.-K.ebir,  on the east  and north by the  Orontes (Nahr el-Asi),  and on  the   west by the Mediterranean,  is largely in-
habited by  Ansariah.   Considered  geographically,  this  regionforms a kind of. island  separated from the rest of the- country byremarkable natural features.   To the south, the depression  ofthe Nahr  el-Kebir  divides  the  Jebel Nuseiriyah or  Ansariahdistrict from the northern part of the Lebanon which is knownas the Jebel Akkar.  This division is very definite, the northern-most slope of the Jebel  Akkar  rising to a height  of 350-400metres  above  the southern bank of the  Nahr el-Kebir,  whilstten kilometres  to the  north of the river, the castle of  Kalaat el-Hosn, or  Hosn  el-Akrad, is on a summit  735  metres high.  Atthis  point the  narrow and deep pass  is  commanded by the neighbouring heights.  In the middle ages the  castle of el-Hosndominated the country  and commanded  the road.  The  Turkshave now made their preparations for defence at Telel Kalak onthe Tripoli-Horns Railway  at about 100 kilometres from the former.To the east, the Jebel  Nuseiriyah is bounded by the Orontes.Bridges over this river are rare  except at  the  two  large  townsof Horns and  llama,  there being only three or four in a  lengthof 140 kilometres.  The one at Jisr es-Shoghur  is  the bestknown.  The Nahr el-Asi  flows from south to north as far as Jisrel-Hadid, another bridge   opposite  Antioch.   Then it abruptlychanges direction and  flows west through  a  gorge some 700-800  metres deep.  Here  it  divides  the  northern limits of theJebel Nuseiriyah  from  the southern slopes of the Amanus  range.Nature of Country.     &quot;  The country  is mountainous and  broken.  It is only onthe coast between Latakiah  and Tripoli that there is a narrowstrip of fairly flat country.  The principle heights from south to north  are those of  Kalaat  el-Hosn,  Safita,  Kadmus,  Aleika,Sahyun, Akrad, Orclu,  Akra Shaksini, Koseir : some  of these riseto 1,700 metres, e.g. Jebel Akra.Rivers.     &quot;  Numerous streams  flow into the the Mediterranean.  Themost important is the Nahr el-Kebir, which flows into  the  sea tothe south of Latikiab.s   Most of  these streams, though of smallvolume, make  communication  with  the interior difficult, owingto their flowing at the  bottom of deep  gorges, and owing tothere being few roads.     &quot;  A  name,  which is not  given on  the  maps but  whichis frequently used by the  natives, is Jebel Kalbiah.   This nameis given to the district between  the  Nahr Banias  and  the Nahrel-Kebir  (Latakiah).  It  is  very mountainous,  and contains anumber of hiding places  used as places of  refuge by brigands,rebels  and deserters.    Many of the  Ansariah have moved there,and  live  by  requisitions  and  robbing the Government;   Thelatter has not yet succeeded in  establishing itself in  the interiorof the  Jebel  Kalbiah, the inhabitants  of  which  remain  exempt from paying taxes and from  military service.
 Races and Sects.     &quot; Besides the Ansariab, who give their name to the country, there  are also a, number  of  important races  which must  be mentioned.     &quot; Christians, belonging both to the  Greek and  the MarOnite churches, are found  in large numbers  about Homs el-Akrad, Santa, and Zimrin, i.e., in the districts  nearest to the Lebanon. There are others  at  Tartus,  round Banias  and  at Latakiah.     &quot; There are some Armenian  villages,  including Kassab  on the slopes of Jebel Akrad.   Mohammedans are numerous in the villages  and  particularly  the larger villages along the  coast, especially at  Latakiah.   Kurds occupy  the Jebel  Akrad,&apos;whence its  name.   Ismailians occupy  some   twenty  villages  round Kadinus, Masyad, and Hamidieh.   They belong to  a Shia  sect, taking  their name  from  one Ismail, father  of  Mohammed, the seventh  Mahdi after  Ali.   In  873  A.D.,  the  divinity  which existed  in  Ali,  was recognized  to have  been  transferred  to Mohammed Ben Ismail.  He was proclaimed Mahdi by Abdullah Ibn Meiiuun  el Kaddah. and his followers were called Ismailians. The population of  the Jebel Ansariab is therefore  very mixed  ; Arabs, Mohammedans,  Ismailians, Kurds, Armenians, Maronites, Greeks, are al I  intermingled with the Ansariah.   The latter are, however, much the most numerous and  most  influential. Numbers and Statistics.     &quot; No reliable statistics have ever been  drawn  up.   Several&quot;authors and travellers have estimated the number of Ansariah at from 110,000 to 150,000.   The American missionary Van Dyck, in  his   Arabic  geography,  estimates  that,  there  are  112,500 Ansariah, distributed as  follows :  In  the Akkar district south of the Nahr el-Kebir, 3,500 ;  Santa district, 25,100 ; Sanjak  of Latakiah, 75,000 ; in the mountains east of the Orontes,  3,750  ; Ruacl,  5,000.    Van  Dyck  does  not   mention   the Ansariah of  Antiooh, or those of  Sueidia and El-Aidiyeb,  six kilometres north  of Antioch.   Nor-does  he  include those of the Jebel Ala, Mersina, Adana,  or Tarsus.  In  upper   Galilee, north  of Lake Tiberias, there are also  three Ansarieb villages, Ain  Fit,  Zaura and El Gaduar.  A fair estimate of the numbers of the Ansariah could perhaps be between 125,000 and 150.000, of whom 110,000 to 120,000 are  actually  in the Jebel Ansariah. Occupations.     &quot; In general, the Ansariah are fellahs or  peasants,&apos; who live in  a  fertile  country and  practice  agriculture.  Besides cereals, wheat, barley, millet, etc., they cultivate the olive and the vine. A recent lint very  well developed industry  is tobacco,  that  of Latakiah  being  very well known ; it is cultivated in  the hills near Latakiah by the Ansariah.
Origin and History.    &quot;According  to sonic savants,  the  Ansariah are sectariansof a  certain  Mohammed ibn Noseir, a follower of the eleventhShiite Imam, who in the  eleventh century founded the  religionof the Arabs.   It is from him  that  they are supposed  to haveta,ken  their name.   Arab historians  have adopted  tins  legend,but place  Ibn  Noseir  in  the seventh  century.    Dussaudputs forward the  claim  that  the Ansariah are the descend entsof the &quot; Mazerini &quot;  of Pliny (&quot;Hist. Nat.,&quot;  5,  81), and  this  is supported  by the similarity of name and locality.   In spite ofthe Arab  invasion of the  seventh  century,  the  Ansariah werenot won over  to Islam,  but  remained  pagans.    There  is  no mention  of them  from   the seventh  to the.  eleventh centuries.They  are next mentioned in the chronicles of the Crusaders.  In1099,  after  taking Antioch,  the Franks captured  Maraa eu-Namaan ;  they then moved  to the Lebanon, where they killed.a  large  number  of  people called  Noseiris, and  subsequentlybeseiged Arkah in the district of Tripoli (Bar  Ilebraeus,  &quot; Chr.Syrie,&quot; 281).  The Crusaders  gradually occupied all the  strong-holds of the country :  Ivalaat el-Hosn, Safita, Oriaineh, Markab,Aleika  and  Manokah  in Markab,  Sahyun,  Kosseir, Shoghur,Bakas, Bokebeis (Abu Kabeis), Barin, etc., but after the battle ofHattin (1187)  Saladin conquered the  Ansariah  country, and theinhabitants became subject to the Sultan of Egypt.    &quot;Early  in the  twelfth century the Ismailians who were at Salamyah, near Hama, took refuge in the Ansariah country.In. 1132 the)&apos;  captured  Kadmos, Ivahf,  and  some years  later,Masyad, Rosafa, Nadir, etc., and became celebrated by the  nameof Assassins.   Historians have given their  chiefs the name ofthe Old Man of the Mountain.  The Ansariah  had to submit tothis invasion and several adopted the doctrines of the Ismailians;especially in  the time of their best known  chief, Rashid  ed-DinSinan.  In the year A.H. 71.7, under the Mahdi, Mohammed ibnHassan, the Ansariah took by surprise  the  Mohammedan  town of Jebele and killed most of the inhabitants.  The governors  ofLatakiah and Tripoli prepared  to suppress them, but the  Sultanordered them to be left alone as they cultivated the land for theMohammedans.  The Ansariah detested Christians just as muchas Mohammedans.   Burchard de Mont Sion described them as acruel, malicious race, and hostile to Christians.  Bibars,  .1260 1277, destroyed  the  j tower of  the  Ismaihans  and tried  to convert the Ansariah to  islam,  but  unsuccessfully.   They wereneither converted  nor assimilated,  and gradually returned  totheir  independent way  of life.  About this  period  the  Raslauwas the most important  tribe of the  Ansariah.   They  surprisedand  captured  the  stronghold  of   Masyad  occupied  by theIsmailians and killed  most of  the  inhabitants.   The Pasha  of damascus  sent an army which burned a few  villages and was recalled without having  penetrated far into the  mountains.     &quot; In  1854 a  minor local chief, Ismail Bey of the Metawara
tribe,  which infested the  roads opposite to . Hama, installedhimself  at  Santa,   with  some  hundreds  of  followers  andassumed the title of Mushir of the Jebel.   He soon  establishedorder in the country and was able at the same time to keep on good terms with the  Ottoman Government, which, in return foran  annual,  revenue  of  12,000 paid by   him,  recognized  his authority  and  allowed him a  free hand.  Ismail became theterror of the whole district and the most  important families hadto submit to him.  He ruled over Kalbiah,  Hosn, and  even thenorthern  district, about   120,000   people acknowledging  his authority.   His exactions  at last caused strong interests to  fight against him.   He intrigued with  the Porte in order to  be giventhe stronghold of Kalaat el-Hosn, where he would be secure againstsudden attack.   But just as he was about to take possession  of it,all  the Mohammedans of  Hosn and Akkar rose against  him.Religious questions were raised, and the Government reconsideredtheir decision and refused Ismail  what he had asked for.  troops from Damascus and Tripoli invaded  the Jebel.  Ismail took toflight and sought the higher mountains, where he was beti^edand killed by one of  his relations, Ali Chelli.     &quot; After the disappearance of Ismail, the  Ottoman Govern-ment tried to administer the country itself,, but it was with greatdifficulty  that  the officials collected taxes  and  raised recruits.Many times it has been necessary to  adopt rigorous measures,invade the country and pillage the villages.   In 1870 the Russianagent  at  Latakiah,  writing  to  his  Consul-General at Beyrout,said, &apos; The state of the Ansariah districts is  most wretched. Thereis neither justice nor security.  The state of the Jebele district isstill worse ; the Ansariah  villages are wasted by pillage and fire.The tax collectors, the officials and the friends of the Kaimmakampractise every injustice and take from them all means of existence.&apos;Side by side  with military action against  them, attempts  weremade to convert them, but the mosques which were built remainedempty as in the time of Bibars.Present  Situation.     &quot; A government of this kind, which has remained the  samefor the last forty-five years, is not such as  can win the sympathy of the Ansariah.  Equally strong is  the  hatred which the latterbear to everything which  is Turkish and Mohammedan.  Thereare  no families  sufficiently powerful to  raise the standard  ofrevolt, and their misfortunes have not  united the different  clansor Ashirets.     &quot; All these races nourish their old antipathies in their hearts.Except for some of the Mohammedans, all.  wish to be free of theOttoman yoke.  They are, however, incapable of uniting for common action, possessing no leaders or generally acknowledged chief, and each having no confidence in his neighbour. Even now the Christiansdo not trust the Mohammedans, and they would not have more trustin the Ansariab.  Numerous deserters,  as many as 7,000 or 8,000,are  said  to be  in  the  Kalbiah mountains.    This figure is
doubtless  exaggerated,  and moreover the  sentiments o   thesedeserters are unknown and they should not be trusted.   It  mustbe acknowledged, however, that the circumstances at present are much in favour of Allied intervention in  the Jebel Ansariah andin the  Lebanon.    The  suppression  of the privileges of the lebanon  has  brought  discontent to a head, the suppression of&apos; bedel&apos;  annoys  a  large number of the middle and influentialclasses,  and  the  announcement  of  a levee-en-masse of all  able-bodied  men to  fight  for  the  Germane-Turks  exasperates thewhole population.&quot;                          NOTES.Jebel Radhwah.     The following is contributed by Bimbashi Garland, who hastravelled  recently  from Abu  Markha  in Wadi  Ais to  KheifHusein in Wadi Yambo :      &quot; I was told by two Arabs at different times that in JebelRadhwah  there lives  a quite  distinct tribe.   They are said  tohave gardens,  producing  everything  they  require,  goats  andother animals.   They  never allow an  outsider to ascend theirJebel and have no intercourse whatever with the outside world.They use neither money, nor clothing, and are said to be of - asavage disposition.  Passing close to the Jebel one was unable  tosee any of their settlements.     &quot; It rained quite heavily on May 30, for the greater part  ofthe clay, and I think this is  somewhat late  for rain in  thiscountry.&quot;The  fight  between  Rashidite and Sherifial forces.     At the fight mentioned in  our last issue  (p.  269) it seems-doubtful whether Ibn Rashid himself was present, but certainlyRashid Ibn  Leilah was there.  He escaped.  The Sherifian forces were, it is  reported,  mainly  Hai-b  tribesmen   drawn  fromthe  Feridah   and  Zakara  (Dhikarah).   These  profess   tohave lost only one man.    According  to Suleiman el-Dakhil,nephew of  Jarullali of that ilk, Ibn  RashicTs former agent  at baghdad (Suleiman left Hail about six weeks ago), Rashid IbnLeilah is all-powerful with Ibn Rashid, but, owing to scarcity offood and supplies, the townsfolk and tribesmen are turning moreand  more  against him, and Only need assurance  of our continuancein Mesopotamia to force Ibn Rashid to come  to terms with us.The caravans which have got through from Nejef brought much less  than was expected or is needed, and very  little is coming  up from Kuweit.
