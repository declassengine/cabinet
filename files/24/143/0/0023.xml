SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT, No. XXIII.                                     RUSSIA.    THE whole of the matter included under this head deserves careful reading.   Thesituation of course does  not vet tend to any definite solution, but  at  least GeneralBrusiloffs  offensive  has  demonstrated the existence of a real national feeling in theRussian  people.   This is a  matter of great importance, as many observers doubted whether  the idea of nationality would survive the disappearance of the external symbolsof national existence.    If Russia dropped in value from 40 to 11 after the revolution, she may be said  tohave risen from 11 to I7 as the result of General Brusiloffs success.  Whether this willbe maintained  or increased depends on many circumstances, both  moral  and material.However, the capacity to rise is an established fact, and the probability of Russia  being a great post-war Power is materially increased.                                     TURKEY.    The peace  proposals of the  Onion of Democratic Control are important  as theydemonstrate very clearly that the integrity  of the Baghdad Railway, the maintenanceof the Ottoman Caliphate, and *the retention of Constantinople in Turkish  hands arethe essentials at which this Union aims.   The control  of the Dardanelles is  to  beinternational only if the Suez Canal and tbe Panama Canal and the Straits of Gibraltar-are under similar control.  The person who drew up these proposals  is probably under no illusions as to how  these  terms would work.  International control  is a machinewhich gives the German financier and the Turkish official full scope to  pursue their ends,and  no  doubt  both  would choose suitable  opportunities  to submit  arrangements for revision by the League of Nations.  In former  times  moments of international  crisiswere usually selected  by the ex-Sultan  Abdul  Hamid for reconsideration  of variousreforms previously imposed upon  his Empire.

In a telegram dated the 27th June [No. 974] Sir G. Buchanansaid that Prince Lvov had told him  that the military situation was improving daily ;the fears which he (Sir G. Buchanan) had expressed  of Russia&apos;s inability, on  accountof the economic  situation, to continue  the  war  after the autumn were unfounded,and he saw  no grounds  for supposing that  Russia would  be compelled to  withdraw.The Government  had not contemplated sueh an eventuality.   Shortage of labour wasacute and the economic situation was of course serious.  There were signs of improvement,and both employed and employers were  showing  a disposition  to  make  concessions.Touching the question of maintenance of law and order he declared emphatically thatthe  Government  was determined to prevent  any public demonstration  by unauthorised-rised bodies.   They would have recourse to armed  force if it should be necessary andpublic opinion demanded it.  Now that the Government was fully satisfied that it hadthe  required public  support  it  was  determined to maintain  order, even at cost ofbloodshed, although  it  would naturally only resort to extreme measures if  compelledto do so.   No demonstration of a nature hostile to the Government, he added, wouldbe permitted.     Two days later  he  telegraphed [No. 979] saying that in a  conversation withM.  Terestchenko  he had adverted  to the  fact that the Government  was allowingorders which it  had issued  for the  evacuation  of houses  occupied  by  anarchiststo be entirely disregarded ;  in reply M. Terestchenko had  said that the Minister ofJustice had  made a  great mistake in  issuing orders which he was not prepared  toenforce, if necessary, and the Government had not wished to provoke a  serious  crisisover what were after  all but trifling incidents.  He personally shared Sir G. Buchanan&apos;opinion that  the sooner the trial of strength took place  the better ; the situation  inthe fleet at Helsingfors was  again becoming  acute, in consequence of German agents,       [898-501                                                          B
and matters -would not really improve there till the Government had settled once andfor all with Petrograd.    On the  same day [29th June]  he transmitted [No. 980] a telegram from the assistant military attache saying that the chief of the staff had  spoken to him  of aproposal that the All-Russia Conference of the Councils of Workmen and  Soldiers&apos;Deputies  should become a  temporary  parliament, either  becoming  the ProvisionalGovernment  or acting as an advisory body to  the  present  Government,  or  itselfappointing a  totally new Government.   The Government, he said, had no power at all,and one of these alternatives  was the only possible way out of the  situation.   If calledupon to act against the bourgeoisie, every unit of the Government,  he said, would  turnout.   He  also said that the Government had no power to stop  the &quot;Pravda&quot; propa-ganda, though so long as it continued there could be no improvement in the situation.  .    The Demonstrations on 1st July. Sir  G. Buchanan telegraphed on the  1st July[No. 996] that the demonstration had passed without any serious incident.  The Cadetsand the Cossacks had refused to participate, and, as viewed from the Embassy, the demon -stration was  mainly of an anti-war and anti-Government  character.  (? No) arms  were carried, and though most of the regiments were represented by delegation, the troopsdid not turn  out in force.   Nearly all the banners bore inscriptions either hostile to theGovernment  and the capitalists or against a continuation of  the  war.  In two  casesbanners with inscriptions in a contrary sense were torn  down  by the  extremists, ofwhom there was a considerable group near the Embassy; several free fights took place,but there was no hostile demonstration  against the Embassy  itself.  The chief of thestaff of the military district informed the assistant military attache that there had beena few cases of rioting, but  nothing serious.   Fewer people  had taken  part than was expected,  as the parties supporting the Government had not taken  part.    The Ukraine. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the  29th  June  [No. 985] that hebad had  a conversation with M. Terestchenko on the subject of  the Ukraine and theattitude of the Government towards the movement for autonomy.    He said that thiswas a question which must be  left to the  Constituent  Assembly  which was  to  meetearly  in October.   It was the duty of the Provisional Government to keep intact thenational patrimony, but it fully sympathised  with  the Ukrainian desire for some   formof autonomy.   Measures suitable for  one province were  unsuitable for others,  localconditions being so  varied,  and  local  self-government was  the only  solution of theproblem.   He himself was a Ukrainian and knew the people well; they furnished thebest troops to the army and  were more (? nationalist) than other Russians.   Germanand Austrian agents had been working hard, but he had  faith in  the  Ukrainians, andhe did not believe that the  movement  in favour of autonomy would take a separatistshape if, as he hoped  would soon be the case, these foreign agents were eliminated.    The  assistant military  attache, telegraphing  through Sir G.  Buchanan on the29th June [No.  980], said that he had  good authority  for saying  that  the  Ukrainemovement was  growing ;  in Petrograd 60  per cent, of  one of the infantry units wasUkraine,  and this unit  was recruited  from others;  at  the  same  time the artillerydivision was entirely Ukraine.  It  was thought that Ukraine units were  inevitable;the formation of a Ukraine army was possible.                         *    Military  Service Agreement. Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed  to  Sir  G. Buchanau[No. 1387] on the  29th June, in reply to  his  telegram of the  29th May [EasternReport  XIX, p. 3],  saying  that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government accepted the agreementproposed  by  the  Russian  Government,  subject  to the  following  amendments  in drafting :     1. In clause 2 omit &quot; will.&quot;    2. In clause 3 after word &quot;refuse&quot; insert words  &quot;after due notice given.&quot; Insame  clause  after words  &quot; effected  by&quot;  insert   words  &quot; the proper&quot; before  word&quot; authorities.&quot;    3. In clause 4  for  &quot;national   authorities&quot;  read &quot;diplomatic  or  consularauthorities.&quot;    Sir G. Buchanan should explain to the Russian Government that  the amendments proposed  were only  made  for purposes of clearness.  Amendment 2 was necessary inorder that British subjects in Russia might have sufficient time in which to make their arrangements, and because  owing  to legislation here measures could not  be  taken toapply the Military Service  Act to Russians until thirty days after the  Order in Council
setting forth the agreement with the Russian Government had been published. Mr. Balfourleft it to him to arrange with  the Russian Government  the length of time  allowedBritish subjects in Russia,   but  he thought thirty  days  should  be  the minimum.The word  &quot; proper &quot;  in  amendment  3  was inserted merely for purposes  of precision :that amendment was  considered necessary to avoid any misunderstanding.     The Russian Government should be urged to accept  the amendment as amendedwithout delay,  as time was pressing, in  order that arrangements might be  made to transport to Bussia those Russians who might wish to return,  and Sir G. Buchananshould telegraph as soon as th e agreement was concluded.     The Russian Government should also be urged to take steps to call  all Russians inEngland to the colours.  Mr.  Balfour suggested that the best method  of doing thiswould be for the Russian Embassy to publish a statement  here  that  all Russians ofmilitary age were called up.   In any case  some action would be  necessary, both here and in Russia, in order to give effect  to article  1 of the  agreement, after the agreement had been signed.     The Russian  Government should be  informed  that  it  was understood that the validity of  the  convention was limited to  the  duration of the  present  war, and thatHis  Majesty&apos;s  Government  therefore hoped  they  would agree to the insertion of a fifth  clause in  the agreement as follows :  5. This  agreement shall cease to have force at the conclusion of this present war.     Industrial Profits.-Sir G. Buchanan  in a telegram [No. 968] received on the29th June said that the British  employers in  Petrograd  had unanimously decided to approach the  Government through  Mr. Plenderson  offering  to  transfer the control ofindustry and profits for  the period  of the  war in return for the Government makingitself responsible for  determining  labour  conditions and  the protection  of property.This course was rendered necessary by the general disturbance of industry.    Finance. Sir  G. Buchanan telegraphed  [No.  959]  on  the  23rd June (telegram received on the 28th June) that the Bussian Government proposed to make the existing regulations regarding exchange so stringent that it would not  in  future be possible toremit abroad, except by special permission.  The Counsellor of Embassy had discussedtbe question with the Minister of Finance, and had little doubt that he could  come tosome  working arrangement which would alleviate the hardship on two classes of Britishsubjects who seemed most  worthy  of consideration, viz., those called up for  militaryservice, and wage-earners in  Russia, who had families to support in the United Kingdom.There were, however,  other important interests involved, and the Minister for  ForeignAffairs had stated that  he  thought the whole question ought  to be considered inconnection  with the financial arrangements between the two Governments foreshadowedat the  Petrograd  Conference.  He   added that the  Russian  regulations had theircounterpart  in  England, whence money could  only be remitted to  France by special arrangement.    Proposed Aeroplane  Propaganda. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan onthe 3rd July [No. 1428] that the military authorities preferred  that no further action should be taken in the proposed propaganda by dropping literature from aeroplanes onthe German lines, as the Germans had threatened special punishment for any aviatorcaught in so doing.     Detention  of  German  Consular Ofjicers.-Qir  G. Buchanan  telegraphed  on the1st July [No. 995]  that  the  Swedish Legation had been requested by  the  GermanGovernment to protest against the detention (near Baku) of the consular  officers whowere arrested in Persia by  the British  authorities  and handed over to  the  Bussianconsul at Ispahan for despatch to Russia.   The Russian  Government wanted  to know the views of the British Government in regard to their release ; and further as to therelease of the Swedish officers of the  Persian  gendarmerie who were arrested in persia and are now also  interne 1  near  Baku, their  release  having been demanded  by thePersian and the Swedish legations  in Petrograd.                                    POLAND.    The American Polish  Legion. Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed to  Sir G.  Buchanan onthe 3rd July [No.  1417] that he believed that the scheme for raising a Polish army &quot;inAmerica was being considered  by the United States administration,  to whose notice       [898-50]                                                       B 2.
it had been brought unofficially.   The Poles who  were promoting the scheme had been told that their best course -would be to get the  United States  Government to ask theRussian Government for officers.                                   RUMANIA.    M.  Bratiano&apos;s Scheme  of  Reform.  Sir G.  Barclay telegraphed on the 29th June[No. 341] that the  Chamber  had  passed (by a  majority  of  130  to 14  with  1abstention), the bill embodying the scheme of reform proposed by  M.  Bratiauo.  Thefact that most of those who had  attacked M.  Bratiano at the last moment decided tosupport the bill, fearing the odium of voting against a measure so favourable to the peasants,  accounts for the smallness of tbe minority.   &apos;    Request for  Officers to he sent from Rumania to Macedonia.Sir G.  Barclaytelegraphed on the 23rd June [No.  334] that the Italian Minister at Jassy had requested the Rumanian  Government to despatch certain Rumanian officers and civilians ofKutzo-Ylach extraction to Macedonia, with a view to furthering Italian influence in that region.  The French Minister, having heard of  this, asked the Brime Minister whetherthe report was true, and was informed that it had been promised that for this  purpose100 Rumanian  officers and  civilians  of Macedonian origin should  be sent.  TheFrench  Minister pointed  out  that use  would  be made of this to prove that Italy hadtaken  part in  an  intrigue against Greeks and Serbians,  but the Prime  Ministerreplied  that he could not now back out  of his promise, the  matter had gone too far.Telegraphing again on the 28th June, Sir G. Barclay said [No. 340] that be bad learntthat the officers in question bad been forbidden by the King  to leave for Macedonia, onaccount of their military  duties.   The same pretext could not be made use of in thecase of  civilians, but he gathered  that the Prime Minister would not be annoyed if thepassage of such persons was refused by His Majesty&apos;s Government.                                    TURKEY.    The Peace Proposals of the Union of Democratic  Control. The Union of Demo-cratic Control makes the following proposals in  regard to Turkey  -    Russian democracy has repudiated the imperialistic  policy of  the Tsax^s to annexConstantinople.  The  way  is therefore  open  for a  proposal to neutralise, or inter-nationalise, the city  and  the straits.  It  is against  the interest of  the world that thegreat trading waterways of the world should be in the hands of single Powers.    The policv of  international control over the Ottoman Empire should be maintained and extended, so as to provide full security for the Christian peoples  and freedom ofdevelopment for other races under the suzerainty of the Sultan.    But  no immediate settlement of the Turkish Empire  could be regarded as  final.The arrangements would necessarily have  to be  revised from time to time by the  Leagueof Nations.  The maximum of freedom  for the various  nationalities  and freedom oftrade between all  the parts, and  equality of economic opportunity for  the nationals ofall  European Powers, should be the policy followed.                                    PERSIA.    Relations with  Great Britain [see Eastern  Report XXII, p.  4]. Sir C.  Marlingtelegraphing on the 3rd July [No.  226], said that he did not think the Persians would welcome  Mr. Schuster&apos;s return.   It was  because he was ready to flout the two  powers that his masterful ways  were tolerated  on the  previous occasion ;  it was, moreover,unlikely that he would return without  his old powers, and these would probably herefused by the Medjlis.    As to the general situation, Sir C. Marling thought the possible ill results to us ofthe hostility of the  Democrat influence in the  present Cabinet was  exaggerated by theGovernment of India.   The wish to get  rid of foreign interference accounted  for the-widespread anti-British feeling, and  the South  Persian Rifles  are  regarded  as a newinstrument of such interference.   Persia  might possibly declare war against us in some such event as Russia concluding  a separate peace on terms unfavourable to  us, or  arising in India, but failing such a contingency she  will pursue the policy of official pacifitywith unofficial assistance to the enemy.   The feeling against us was, he said, unquestionable-ably fomented by enemy agents, but there did not appear to  be any real inclination forthe Germans.  Persia was willing to make use  of them, but had no  intention of doing anything  in return if she could avoid it.
     Another Assassination. Sir C. Marling  telegraphed  on the 1st July [No. 223]that on the previous day Muntekhab-ed-Dowleh had been assassinated ; the crime was undoubtedly political, but the reasons for it were not yet clear.   Muntekbab-ed-Dowlehhad been treasurer since Heynssens had resigned his temporary charge  of that post inthe September of last year.                                     INDIA.     The Mahsuds. The Viceroy telegraphed on  the  28th  June that, the MahsudMaliks  having  made  overtures, a  guarantee had been  given them that,  duringnegotiations,  opfrations should be suspended ; but  the  Mahsuds were to be informedthat if  they  endeavoured to procrastinate  the guarantee would be  withdrawn.  Thetroops get  a much-needed rest by this suspension of operations ; they  will remain nearHaidaria and so&apos;be ready (should the Mahsuds show signs of unduly protracting thenegotiations)  to take further action.   Details of the proposed terms of settlement hadnot yet been  received.                                AFGHANISTAN.     The Viceroys Monthly Report. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 30th  June thatthe situation  in Afghanistan remained satisfactory.  The health of the Amir had been restored.   He had written to the  effect that he  was  taking stringent measures toprevent his subjects from assisting the Mahsuds ;  his letter  was markedly friendly andhis attitude had had a palpably disconcerting effect on the Mahsuds.   It  was reportedthat Nasrulla Khan was once more in disfavour.LATEST  INTELLIGENCE. -                                     RUSSIA.     General Situation. A report has been received from one  who  enjoys  the  entireconfidence of His Majesty&apos;s Government, in v/hich the writer says :      1. That he found the temper of Moscow much more virile and animated than thatof Petrograd, and much freer from the instability and nervousness for which allowance had  constantly to be made in judging the situation  in the latter  place, for which reason,however, he had received an even less cheerful impression of the  position  than imPetrograd.  Incidentally, he  says,  Moscow  confirmed  his   impression  that  such  areduction in the production capacity of Russia, must be anticipated as would  bring itnear to complete  collapse.  The political position  disclosed  was equally depressing.  Along conversation with the president of the Soldiers&apos; Council gave the impression ofearnestness and sincerity, but revealed  such  a fundamental  difference of principle asmade argument useless.  He explained frankly that Russia  was sick of the war  andindustrial exhaustion.   National  feeling  hardly  existed, but  at the same  time therew&quot;as, even in the masses, a sentiment of honour which made the idea of a separate peacedistasteful.  To create out of this feeling a real enthusiasm for  the war in  the people and  army was the task  of his party, and it was rendered very difficult by the refusal ofthe  allies to accept without reserve the platform  of Russian (? Socialists).     The widter  of the report  pointed  out that  we had undertaken to review ouragreements in. concert with  the Provisional Government, and then the president  saidrather naively that what in particular  made  the views  of British labour on  the  warsuspicious to his friends was that they seemed to coincide with those  held by Russiansof middle class.   A meeting with the  Workmen&apos;s Council was  even  more  instructive,.Rudniew, the President, made a speech  of great ability, delivered in a  tone  of quietconviction which  made it all the  more  impressive, the substance  of  which  was, &quot; Wedo not charge British labour with imperialistic aims, but none the less it is supportingan imperialistic Government.   Therefore  there is no question of our converting eachother.   We have heard your views and we continue to differ.     2. There are, he said, two things in particular about which  we must  be on ourguard.  One is any appearance of coldness  or neglect  in  our dealings with the Pro-visional Government.  Anything which injures their credit  here can only  operate tostrengthen the forces of disorder and to postpone  the restoration of Russia.   The otheris the effect  on our  own people of extremist propaganda.  There are two  currents ofopinion in Russia as to the means of influencing  the western  allies in the direction of
 what is called general peace, but which in truth would be a general surrender.  One is for direct action on the western proletariat to provoke  an uprising  against capitalism and the  war together. The other  is for constitutional action by  first converting Labour and (? Socialist) parties, and then trusting to  pressure  they  will exercise on their Governments.          .     The Demonstration of the 1st July. - Sir G, Buchanan telegraphed on the 2nd July [No. 1006]  that, when  speaking of the demonstration, the Minister for Foreign Affairs had said  that it had wanted in backbone and had been foredoomed to failure.   Some anarchists had taken advantage of it to release a few  of their comrades from prison, and the Government had replied by arresting the governor of the prison for not having telephoned  for troops,  (? as well  as) sixty anarchists  who  had refused  to evacuate Dournovo&apos;s  Villa.  The men of the Poutilovs] Works had consequently struck, and there was considerable unrest in some outlying districts.  This might lead to bloodshed, but Government were quite prepared.  They were supported both by  the Soviet and by the All-Bussian Congress, who  were sending emissaries to the districts concerned with a view to calming the workmen.  Taken in conjunction with the success that had attended the Russian offensive, he hoped that the settlement of the Petrograd question would not be long postponed.                                    POLAND.     The Polish  Army.-Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed  from Berne on the 4th July [No. 548] that it had been pointed out to him by M. Seyda, who had just returned from a conference in Paris,  that the French Government seemed to have realised that a Polish army created  by the unilateral  act of Poles residing in  France  would be  insignificant from the point of view of effectives.   The French Government, therefore, was  about to try to come to an arrangement with the United States Government for the incorporation of Poles residing in the United States in the Polish army.  But M.  Seyda also pointed out that  the Poles  would not  be  satisfied  unless Great Britain should  be  a  party to  the creation of the  army, and he therefore  hoped that a Polish army  under the auspices of the Entente Powers and the United States  would be formed.  This would be the best line of policy vis-a-vis the Central Powers, and it was the only course which would satisfy Polish opinion :  moreover, the maximum  number of men, which he placed at  70,000, would be produced by an arrangement on these  lines.                                   ABYSSINIA.     The  Bequest for  Aeroplanes  [see Eastern  Report,  XXI,  p.  4]. Mr. Thesiger telegraphed on the  2nd July [No.  38] that he had been informed by  Ras that, if the Powers would  agree to certain things, he  firmly believed that he could  induce the Council to  break off relations  with  Turkey and Germany, and  to  expel all Germans with a safe conduct.  He  (Mr. Thesiger) and his  French  and Italian colleagues were strongly in  favour of accepting these proposals, as such an  agreement would destroy Lij Yasu&apos;s last hope  of -success  and so restore order.  The conditions suggested were as follows :      1. Permission for the importation of 16,000 rifles now at  Jibuti.  This. Mr. Thesiger says, would  be an exception, leaving the main question for future  settlement.  2. A loan of three aeroplanes for Magdala.  The French Minister  suggests that each of the three Powers should send one.  3.  A renewal of the guarantee of the integrity of Abyssinia. 4. A guarantee that there should be no cession to the Central Powers  after the war of territory bordering on Abyssinia.                                    ARABIA.    The Aneizah.-General  Maude reports  that  Fahad Bey, more commonly known as Ibn Hadhdhal, has thrown in  his lot with us [see Eastern Report,  XXII, p. 5]; he is said to exercise  a  dominating  influence over the Aneizah,  between  Damascus and Baghdad.    [According to the  15 Personalities of Arabia,&apos;&apos;  Fahad Bey is the  paramount chief of the Amarat, and his tents  number about  3,000.   He is wealthy and owns palm gardens at  Ghazazah, near Kerbsla, and elsewhere on the Euphrates.  He is a pah-Arabist and hates  the Turks  for  personal  reasons,  having, been- imprisoned  more than once.]  -PRINTED AT THE FOKICIttH OFFICE BY C. K. HARRISON. - 6/7/1917.

Major  Joyce  sends the following  report  on  his visit  to  Bir  Derwish :       &quot; Sherif  All  has  divided   his  force  into  two  sections ; himself  and his  Bedouins,  who he  states are  1.0,000 (but I estimate them at about 5,000) occupy the hills and open ground south-west of the big well at  Bir Derwish.  His  Meccan  levies hold the  hills  just  above his  camp and have  regular  outposts stationed  on  the tops.  The  Bedouins  also  hold hills to  the north-east of  the Wadi Freish in the direction of  the Turkish positions at Jelajila, about eight  miles to the  north-east, on  the Sultani  road.  It is  possible,  therefore, that  the  numbers of Bedouins  are  greater  than  1   estimate, owing  to  their  wide distribution.      &quot; The trained army and artillery are camped about  one-and- a-half miles north-west  of  Bir Derwish.  They hold a regular line  of  outposts, with  guns and  maxims  in position.   They have their own ration and  ammunition- flump, and  apparently Sherif Ali gives  them a  free hand as regards  interior economy, merely telling off  1,200 camels to bring their requirements from Yanibo.    The  result  is  satisfactory  and there  appear  to be discipline  and  system  in their  arrangements.   Their  animals look  fit  and  well  cared -for,  and  they have  lost  only four Australian horses in the four months&apos;  operations from Rabegh.     &quot;dander  Effendi  commands in  the absence  of Nuri  Bey and informs me their numbers  are 1,800, of  which 1,500  might be considered effective.   I spent a whole morning at their camp and took a note of their immediate,  requirements, which appear very  reasonable considering the length of time they  have been in the field.     &quot; Their artillery  and machine guns  are all  in good  order, and there is apparently a marked improvement in their handling of  the artillery, and  they are satisfied with the  effectiveness of their  guns.     &quot; The  taking of  Medina is  undoubtedly  Sherif Ali&apos;s one aim and objective, and he practically admitted  that  when this was achieved his part in active operations  would come to an end. I  suggested  that  his  Bedouins had  not been as active as might be  expected,  thinking  possibly that,  when. Medina fell,  their sources of  pay  and  supplies might either  cease or  be  greatly reduced.   Sherif Ali assured me that this  was  not  so, but  on the contrary they were more loyal and united  than at any time since  the Revolt,  broke  out.  This  I believe  is  so,  and their general attitude and  discipline appeared far better than  when X was in touch wyth them at Rabegh.   Towards myself, certainlythey were much more  friendly and less suspicious.
    &quot; Sherif Ali&apos;s next offensive will be directed against, Jelajila,where there is an abundant water supply, ancl, if the surroundinghills can   be occupied,  the  Turks&apos; communications  betweenMedina and Bir el-Mashi can be seriously  threatened  by  raidingparties.   It-is reported to be held by one  battery of Turks, anda recent reconnaissance discovered at least  two gun positions.    &quot; The impression derived from my   visit  to  Sherif Ali  isthat he shows great improvement in organisation.   His arrange-ments  for supplies and  transport  appear  good  and there  isorganisation  and  system.  This  is  probably  greatly assisted bythe presence of two resj:tonsible persons at Yambo, viz., SheikhAbdel Qadir and  Yuzb. Abdel Latif Kamel.    &quot;What is greatly required  is a  G.O.C.  to  make  proper useof the forces at Sherif Ali&apos;s disposal.  With the best-intentions in the world, he  is incapable of  commanding  troops, owing  toentire  lack  of military knowledge.   He changes his  mind andalters his  plans from day to clay ; consequently long periods  ofinactivity occur when undoubtedly much might be done by strongreconnaissance and constantly  worrying the  Turks  with  Insmachine  and mountain  guns.   His presence   is  essential  tokeep  together the Bedouin tribes ; but unless   a  competentcommander takes over charge of the operations, it  appears to mevery  doubtful  if   any  important  military  success  wdll   beobtained.   Colonel Cadi is  at present with  Sherif Ali in  the capacity of adviser ancl this may bring about some better results.     &quot; I questioned Sherif  Ali closely re  his Syrian officers and troops and he expressed  himself  entirely  satisfied  with them inevery  way, with  the exception  of  two  of them who had  beensent to Mecca as  their conduct had not been entirely satisfactory.Though   he would  never  acknowledge  it, I  clo   not considerSherif Ah  really possesses  a very strong hold over these Syrianofficers, ancl the  part  they  take  in  operations is arranged  moreby themselves  than by Sherif Ali.   Their  inactivity  since  theaction at  Bir el-Mashi is most probably  due to their own lackof  enterprise ancl  the  fact  that  Sherif   Ali has  not sufficientcontrol to supplement it.     &quot; Sherif Ali and the other  Ashraf I  met were most cordialin their relations with me while I was in his camp.  No british officer had previously been in as  far as  Bir Derwish  ancl a feAVmonths  ago  it  would  have been  absolutely forbidden.   TheSheikhs   I travelled  with  were most open  ancl friendly ancltreated me more  as an ally  than as a unit  to be conveyed by theSherifs order.  It seems possible that in time British officersmight be  allowed to co-operate in an executive capacity  in this area, but  the old prejudices are  slow in changing.&quot;     The  following notes were  collected  from refugees on  theroad between Yambo and Bir Derwish by  Major Joyce and sentto Cairo on June 11 :       &quot; The Turks have now ordered the deportation of practicallythe whole civilian  population - of Medina.   Formerly  the idea
was for these to be sent north to Syria, but as  rations becamescarce  and  the railway  interrupted, orders  were  issued  for civilians to leave in any direction.   The upper classes and richmerchants left some months ago  for the north.   The majorityof the  poorer classes take refuge in the camps of  Sherif Ali andSherif  Zeid, but a  fairly large number have gone  to  Hail.  Outof a population of  about 25,000,  only 3,000 or 4,000 are  now reported to  be remaining  in  Medina, and  many  of these  are merely  waiting transport to take themselves and their familiesaway.   About 2,000 of these  refugees  were actually in  SherifAli&apos;s camp  when  I visited  Bir Derwish   and I passed manycaravans on the  road.    Native carts  and porters  bring  the refugees, and their  baggage (of  which  there  is a  considerableamount) to  about  two miles outside the city, where it is clumpedand the unfortunate people are left to arrange with the Bedouinsas best  they can to procure camels  to take them  on.   these arrangements  are  usually  made  at night, and  apparendy  theTurks  do not interfere, or endeavour  to seize the camels brought by the Bedouins.   The refugees are allowed to take away only avery  small  quantity  of foodstuffs  and naturally suffer  manyhardships, though  I saw no case of actual  emaciation  or  want.The feeling of these refugees  against the  Turks  is  very  bitterand numerous imprecations are showered on their heads and  onFakhri* Pasha  especially.   All  houses and property had to  be abandoned, and in many cases the former were broken into andall available wood, etc., was stolen.    &quot;  All foodstuffs are now under direct  control of the militaryand there are reported to be large stocks of barley, rice, burghul,semin and lentils actually  in the city.   In spite of this,  onlyhalf-rations  are issued  to the  troops and  issues  of  camel meatare irregular.  Civilians are allowed no meat.  An extension ofthe railway  has been made and it now runs from the old  stationthrough the city up to the citadel near  the  Bab el-Sham.   no compensation was  given for buildings knocked down to clear theway for this extension.  The three main storehouses in Medina areone at  the old railway  station, one in the Haram  enclosure, andone at  the citadel.   A  pump has been erected in the  well in thecourtyard of the Haram and the buildings  themselves have  beenfortified with sand-bags and protected with machine guns.    &quot; Very few soldiers are reported in  Medina itself, but  acoffee-seller  reports very strong entrenchments on Jebel. Ohocl,Jebel  Arsi. and at Jemina ; he  states the majority of the soldiersare outside Medina itself.    &quot; The   Egyptian  Tekia buildings  have  been  turned intoofficers  quarters, about forty  to fifty officers  occupy  it.   the clerk himself was invited to go to Syria, but preferred to returnto Egypt to collect his arrears of pay.    &quot; Fakhri Pasha evidently rules Medina  with  much  severityand it is chiefly due to him that the discontented army is  kepttogether.  Thei-e are very  few Arab officers or  soldiers left  in
Medina, most having been sent to  Syria or&apos; having deserted  tothe Sherif.    Col.  Nevvconibe  reports  that  eight  mines about  two feetdiameter were  picked  up  by  the  Arabs  (Sheikh  Hamud)  atMagana, in the Gulf of Akaba, and  brought  to  Dhaba about  amonth ago. ,  The mines are now to be seen  at Dhaba  and it isstated, that  the /Turks  brought them  to  Magana&apos;  about,  threemonths ago, but did not utilize them.    About June 4, some thirty Ageyl reached Wejh, via Dhaba,from  Akaba,  having deserted from, the Turks.   Thev  say  that another sixty Ageyl are still  with  the Turks,  ready to  desert.Akaba is unoccupied, but patrolled ; also the coast is patrolled forsome  ten miles, either way.    &quot;The strength of  the Turkish  forces  between Maan  andAkaba, is about  one and a half battalions.&quot;                       Motor Car Runs. (a)  Wejh to Jeyadah.     The  following Route Report  has been supplied by Capt.  F. W. Stent, R.F.C.     &quot; June 4, 1917.   One R.F.C. car,one armoured car (stripped) and one  Ford  ear  left Wejh  at 3.30 p.in.   We followed the Khauthla, route  for about twelve miles,  when we branched off  to tbe east and ra.ii over  foothills in  an  easterly direction on  very well marked camel tracks, till we got to Wadi Maura at 5.40 pan. From  here we went north-east to  Abu  Ajaj, which we reached at 6.40 p.ni. and camped for the night.  .There were several  wells here, of which only two were good, and all the going up  to  this point was very easy for cars.     &quot; June 6, 1917.   We left our camp at 4.45 a..m. and ran  in a fairly straight line to a point about six miles north of Khauthla in a wacli  of that name which runs  north  and. south  just here between the two Jebel s Khashub.   We turned into it and ran north to Khorba (with a stop of an hour and a half), which we  reached at 10 a.m.  The going was beginning to be rather bad here,  and as the Rolls-Royce was rather short of spare tyres we decided  to leave it and the Ford and go on  with  the R.F.C. tender.  The water at Khorba was very good and&apos;there  was plenty of it.   We started  again at  10.35  a.m.  and ran  slightly west of north for about seven miles, skit-tiny; Jebel Shaihub  on our  right  till  we got to the end of it,- when  we turned sharply  to the  right into Wacli Kharrar, again skirting J. Shaihub and running east-south-east for about ten  miles ; all of  which was very rough and stony.Here  the  wadi  turns  north-east  (el-Kharra) and runs up   toa narrow gorge in  which there is much,  running water.   We got
 here at 1 An p.m.. but found it  impossible to get any Further owing to the steps in the rock.   :     &quot; Total run about ninety miles in ten.  hours.   1. inspected the pass and found  that there were. three  steps which  could be ma.de passable with very little work, and  I. think guns could be hahd-hauled over them as they are.     &quot; 1 also walked to Jeyadah (about two miles), where 1 found a  very suitable place for an aerodrome, which only needs a little clearing.   We started  back again  the same day, and after picking up the armoured ear and the Ford, reached  Wejh  at 1.30  p.m. on June 6, having accomplished  the return  journey  in  seven hours.&quot; (b)  Yambo to Bir Derwish.     Major  Joyce sends the following under date June 12 :       &quot;Capt.  Stent,  R.F.C.,  and  myself arrived  at  Yambo  on May 21, and disembarked  with the Crossley tender on which  the reconnaissance was to be attempted.   No letter was received from Sherif Ali sanctioning the reconnaissance,  but approval had been obtained from Mecca, and  it was decided, therefore,  not  to  await receipt of the letter  from  Sherif Ali.     &quot; Sheikh Abdel. Qadir at first volunteered  to  proceed  with us and act  as guide,  but, decided later  he was  too busy, and produced in his place; Sheikh And Mirzuk of the Harb tribe, who turned out a.  satisfactory and reliable  guide.   The routes  were thoroughly discussed before  starting ; the  two likely  Ones being one via Bir Said, and the other via, Bedr Honein and. Wadi Safra. It was decided, to attempt  the Bin Said  route first, as being  the more direct one, and also tbe Mahmal route (which meant that an enormous  amount of traffic passed along it).   Camels  were despatched by Sheikh  Abdel Qadir to follow the car tracks in  the event of a breakdown.     &quot; A start was made  at  3.15 p.m.  on May  22,  and  some forty-five miles  were  covered before  halting  for tbe  night at Kashm  Burweith, about four miles west of Bir  Said.  The  road was  generally good, except  for about  half-a-mile of  deep  sand met with oh entering the foothills at Fageish.  The car punctured once on this stretch  of road.  On the morning  of  the 22nd, we proceeded via Bir Said and Wadi  was it up to  about  one-and-a- half miles from the Difran  Pass, when the road ascends to a neck in. the  hills,  and thence  leads on  to  Hamra.    Here the  road became  very  rough  and large stones  made the going difficult.Capt. Stent and myself made a reconnaissance of the road up to the pass and found it, in.its present state, quite  impossible  formotor traffic.   A. narrow  path  laid  been  cleared, by  the Turks,but it would- probably  take a hundred  men ten to fifteen days&apos; work before tbe track could be widened sufficiently and the  largeboulders removed.
     &quot; Finding&apos; this route impracticable, we decided to return to/Bir Said and from there endeavour to get across the  country to Bedr Honein and into the Wadi Safra.   This  was successfully accomplished  and  we entered the Wadi Safra about three miles south-west of Bedr.   Some very soft  sand was  encountered shortly after getting into the  wadi and the car stuck several times ; but  with  this exception we proceeded up the wadi without much difficulty,  though the going  was very rough  ; and eventually we halted at  Wasta for the night.  On the morning of the 24th, we proceeded up  the wadi to Um Biyal, a village with palm trees, about one mile west of Kheif.  Here the road became very  bad, and after  inspecting. it  on.  foot Capt. Stent decided that it was impracticable   to  proceed further,  and  to   attempt  it   would probably  involve  the loss of  the  car  (T calculate fifty  men could make this bit  of  road  passable  in  one  day.)  We  accordingly returned to Hamra, in which stretch  of  about  eleven miles we had four  punctures, and there awaited the arrival of the camels which had been sent out to follow our tracks.   These arrived on the morning of the 24th. ; accordingly  on the morning of the 25th, Capt. Stent and the Crossley tender, with two guides, returned to Yambo and I proceeded on  camels  to Bir  Derwish.-  The  road east&quot; of Kheif for about eight miles would require working  on if cars were  to use  it to any extent ; it  would only be just passable in its present state.  From Bir Abbas to Bir Derwish the  road is excellent.     &quot; The result of the reconnaissance is therefore :      &quot;(1)  That cars can be got as far as Um Diyal, and  Avith  a small amount ot  work, could, in my  opinion, be  got  up  to Bir Derwish.      &quot;(2)  That without a considerable amount of work the  road could not be used to any extent by motor  transport, and  the wear and tear  on  tyres Avould be very great.&quot;                          SYRIA.                      Jebel Nuseiriyah.    The  following  extracts are taken from  a  valuable  report prepared by Pere J. Jaussen and communicated  by the &quot; Bureaudes Renseignements, Division de  Syrie,&quot;  in November, 1916.The full report contains also a list of administrative  districts,statistics of villages, and notes on- personalities.  A map wasalso appended : Population.    &quot; The mountainous- region  bounded  on the  south by theNahr  el-Kebir, on the east and north by the Orontes (Nahr el-Asi),  and on  the  west by the Mediterranean, is largely  dn-
habited by  Ansariah.   Considered  geographically,  this regionforms a kind of island  separated from the rest of the country byremarkable natural  features.   To  the south, the  depression ofthe Nahr  el-Kebir  divides the  Jebel Nuseiriyah or  Ansariahdistrict from the northern  part of the Lebanon which is knownas the  Jebel Akkar.  This  division is very definite, the northern-most slope of the Jebel Akkar rising to a height  of 350-400metres  above  the southern bank  of the  Nahr el-Kebir,  whilstten. kilometres to the  north of the river, the castle of  Kalaat el-Hosn,  or  Hosn  el-Akrad, is on a summit  735 metres high.  Atthis  point the  narrow and deep pass  is  commanded by the neighbouring heights.  In  the middle ages the castle of el-Hosndominated the country and commanded  the road.  The  Turkshave now made  their preparations for defence at  Tele! Kalak onthe Tripoli-Homs Railway at about 100 kilometres from the former.To the east, the  Jebel Nuseiriyah. is bounded by the Orontes.Bridges over this river are  rare  except at  the two  large towmsof Homs and Harna,  there being  only three or four in a lengthof 140 kilometres.  The  one at Jisr es-Shoghur  is  the bestknown.  The Nahr el-Asi flows from south to north as far as Jisrel-Hadid, another bridge   opposite  Antioch.  Then it abruptlychanges direction and flows west through  a  gorge some  700-800  metres deep.  Here  it divides  the  northern limits of theJebel Nuseiriyah from  the southern slopes of the Amanus range.Nature of Country.     &quot;  The country  is mountainous and  broken.   It is only onthe coast between Latakiah  and  Tripoli that there is a narrowstrip of fairly flat country.   The principle heights from south to north  are those of Kalaat el-Hosn,  Safita, Kadmus, Aleika,Sahyun, Akrad,  Ordu,  Akra Shaksihi, Koseir : some  of these riseto 1,700 metres, e.y. Jebel  Akra.Rivers.     &quot;  Numerous streams flow into the the Mediterranean.   Themost important is the Nahr el-Kebir, which flows into  the sea tothe south of Latikiah.   Most of these streams, though of smallvolume, make communication  with  the  interior  difficult, owingto their flowing at the bottom of deep  gorges, and  owing tothere being few  roads.     &quot;  A  name,   which is  not  given on  the maps but whichis frequently used by the  natives,  is Jebel Kalbiah.   This nameis given to the district between  the  Nahr Banias  and  the  Nahrel-Kebir  (Latakiah).  it  is very  mountainous,  and contains  anumber of hiding places  used  as places of  refuge by brigands,rebels  and deserters.   Many of the  Ansariah  have moved  there,and live  by  requisitions  and robbing the  Government.   Thelatter has not yet succeeded in  establishing itself  in the interiorof the  Jebel  Kalbiah, the  inhabitants  of  which remain exempt from paying taxes and from military service.
Races and Sects.     &quot;Besides the Ansariah, who give  their name to the country,there are  also a number of important  races  which  must be mentioned.     &quot;Christians, belonging both to the Greek and  the  Maronitechurches,  are  found in  large  numbers about  Horns  el-Akrad,Santa, and Zimrin,  /.*?., in the  districts nearest  to  the  Lebanon.There  are others  at  Tartus,  round  Banias and  at  Latakiah.     &quot; There are  some Armenian villages,  including Kassab onthe slopes of Jebel  Akrad.  Mohammedans are  numerous in the villages and particularly  the  larger  villages  along the  coast,especially  at  Latakiah.   Kurds occupy the Jebel Akrad, whenceits   name.   Ismailians  occupy  some  twenty villages  roundKadinus, Masyad, and  Hamidieh.  They belong to  a  Shia sect,taking their name   from  one  Ismail, father of Mohammed, the seventh Mahdi after  Ali.   In  873   A.D.,  the divinity  which existed  in  Ali, was  recognized  to  have  been transferred toMohammed Ben Ismail.   He was proclaimed Mahdi by  AbdullahIbn  Meimun  el. Kaddah, arid his followers were called Ismailians.The population of  the Jebel  Ansariah is therefore  very mixed ;Arabs, Mohammedans, Ismailians, Kurds, Armenians, Marouites,Greeks, are all intermingled with the  Ansariah.   The latter  are,however, much the  most numerous and most influential.Numbers and Statistics.     &quot; No reliable statistics have ever been  drawn  up.   Severalauthors and travellers  have estimated the number of Ansariah at from 110,000  to 150,000.  The American  missionary Van  Dyck,in  his  Arabic geography,  estimates  that there  are  11.2,500Ansariah, distributed  as  follows :  In the Akkar district southof the Nahr el-Kebir, 3,500 : Santa district, 25,100 ;  Sanjak ofLatakiah,  75,000 ;  in the mountains  east of the Orontes, 3,750 ;Ruad,  5,000.   Van  Dyck does not  mention   tbe  Ansariahof  Antioch, or those  of  Sueidia and El-Aidiyeh,  six. kilometresnorth of  Antioch.   Nor does he include those  of  the Jebel  Ala,Mersina,,  Adana, or  Tarsus.  In  upper Galilee, north  of  LakeTiberias, there are also three Ansarieh villages, Ain  Fit,  Zauraand El Gaduar.   A fair estimate of the numbers of the Ansariahcould perhaps be between .125,000 and 150.000,  of  whom 110,000to 120,000 are actually in  the Jebel  Ansariah.Occupations.     &quot; In  general, the  Ansariah.  are fellahs or peasants,  who live in  a. fertile country and  practice agriculture.   Besides cereals,wheat, barley, millet, etc.,  they cultivate tbe olive   and  the vine.A recent but very  well  developed industry is  tobacco,  that ofLatakiah  being very  well known ; it is  cultivated in the  hillsnear Latakiah by the  Ansariah.
Origin and History.    &quot; According  to some savants,  the Ausariah are sectariansof a certain  Mohammed ibn. Noseir,  a  follower of the eleventhShiite Imam, who in the  eleventh century founded the  religionof the Arabs.   It is from him  that  they  are supposed  to  havetaken their name.   Arab historians have adopted  this  legend,but  place  Ibn Noseir   in  the  seventh  century.    Dussaudputs forward  the  claim  that  the Ansariah are  the descendentsof the &quot; Mazerini &quot;  of Pliny (&quot;Hist. Nat.,&quot;  5, 81), and  this  is supported  by the  similarity of name  and locality.   In spite ofthe  Arab  invasion of the  seventh  century,  the Ansariah werenot won over  to Islam,  but  remained pagans.    There  is  no mention  of them  from   the seventh  to  the  eleventh centuries.They are next  mentioned in the chronicles of the Crusaders.  In1099,  after  taking Antioch,  the Franks captured  Maraa en-iSTamaan ;  they then  moved  to the Lebanon, where they killeda  large  number  of  people called  JSToseiris, and  subsequentlybeseiged Arkah in  the district of Tripoli  (Bar Hebraeus,  &quot; Chr.Syrie,&quot; 281).  The Crusaders  gradually occupied all the  strong-holds of the  country  : Kalaat el-Hosn, Santa, Oriameh,  Markab,Aleika  and  Mauokah in  Markab,  Sahyun,  Kosseir, Shoghnr,Bakas, Bokebeis (Abu Kabeis), Barin, etc., but after the battle ofHattin (1187) Saladin conquered the  Ansariah country, and tbeinhabitants became subject to the Sultan  of Egypt.     &quot; Early  in.  the  twelfth&apos; century the Ismailians who were at Salamyah, near Ha,ma, took refuge in  the Ansariah country.In 1132 they captured   Kadmos, Kahf,  and  some years  later,Masyad, Rosafa, Kadir, etc., and  became  celebrated by the  nameof  Assassins.  Historians have given their  chiefs the name ofthe Old Man of the Mountain.  The Ansariah had to submit  tothis invasion and several  adopted the doctrines of the Ismailians,especially in  the time of their best known chief,  Rashid  eel-DinSinan.  In the year  A.H. 717, under the Mahdi, Mohammed ibnHassan, the  Ansariah took  by surprise  the  Mohammedan  town of Jebele and killed most of the inhabitants.  The governors  of Latakiah and  Tripoli  prepared  to suppress them, but the Sultan.ordered them to be left alone as they  cultivated  the land for  theMohammedans.  The Ansariab detested  Christians just as  muchas Mohammedans.   Borchard He Mont Sion described them as  acruel, malicious race,  and hostile to Christians.  Bibars,  1260  1277,  destrcyed  tbe power  of  the Ismailians  and tried   to convert the Ansariah to islam, but  unsuccessfully.   They wereneither converted  nor  assimilated, and  gradually returned  totheir independent  way   of life.  About  this period the Raslanwas the most important tribe of the Ansariah.   They  surprisedand captured   the stronghold  of   Masyad  occupied&apos;  by  tbe fsmailians and killed  most of the  inhabitants.   The  Pasha  of Damascus  sent an army which  burned  a few villages and was recalled  without having  penetrated far into the mountains.     &quot; In  1854 a. minor  local chief, Ismail Bey  of the Metawara
 tribe,  which  infested  the roads  opposite  to  Haraa,  installed himself   at   Safita,  with  some  hundreds  of  followers  and assumed the title of Mushir of the Jebel.   He  soon established order in the country and was able at the same  time  to  keep on good terms with the  Ottoman Government, which, in return  for an annual revenue  of  12,000 paid by  him,  recognized  his authority  and allowed him  a  free hand.   Ismail  became  the terror of the whole district and the most important families had to submit  to him.   He ruled over Kalbiah, Hosn,  and even  the northern   district,  about  120,000   people  acknowledging  his authoritj7.  His exactions at last caused strong  interests to fight against him.  He intrigued with the Porte in order to be given the stronghold of Kalaat el-Hosn, where he would be secure against sudden attack.  But just as he was about to take possession of it, all the Mohammedans  of  Hosn and Akkar rose against him. Religious  questions were raised, and the Government reconsidered their decision and refused Ismail what he had asked for.   Troops from Damascus and Tripoli invaded  the Jebel.  Ismail took to flight and sought the higher mountains, where  he was  betraj^ed and killed by one of  his relations, Ali Chelli.     &quot; After the disappearance of Ismail, the Ottoman  Govern- ment tried to administer the country itself, but  it was with great difficulty  that the officials collected taxes and raised  recruits. Many times it has  been necessary  to  adopt  rigorous measures, invade the country and pillage the villages.   In 1870 the Russian agent at  Latakiah,  writing to his  Consul-General at Beyrout, said, &apos; The state of the Ansariah  districts is most wretched.  There is neither  justice nor security.   The  state of the Jebele district is still worse ; the Ansariah villages are wasted by pillage and fire. The tax collectors, the officials and the friends of the Kaimmakam practise every injustice and take from them all means of existence.&apos; Side by  side with military  action against them, attempts were made to convert them, but the mosques which  were built remained empty as in the time of Bibars. Present  Situation.     &quot; A government of this kind, which has remained the  same for the last forty-five years, is not such as can win the sympathy of the Ansariah.   Equally strong is the hatred which the  latter bear to everything which is  Turkish and Mohammedan.   There are  no families  sufficiently  powerful to raise  the standard of revolt, and their misfortunes have not united  the  different  clans or Ashirets.             .     &quot; All  these races nourish their old antipathies in their hearts. Except for some of the  Mohammedans, all wish to be free of the Ottoman yoke. They are, however, incapable of uniting for common action, possessing no leaders or generally acknowledged chief, and each having no confidence in his neighbour.  Even now the Christians&apos; do not trust the Mohammedans, and they would not have more trust in the Ansariah.  Numerous deserters, as many  as 7,000 or 8,000, are  said   to  be  in  the Kalbiah  mountains.   This  figure  is
doubtless  exaggerated, and moreover  the sentiments of thesedeserters are unknown and they should not be trusted.   It mustbe acknowledged, however, that the circumstances at present are much in favour of Allied intervention in the Jebel Ansariah andin the  Lebanon.   The  suppression  of  the  privileges of the lebanon has  brought discontent  to a head, the suppression of&apos; bedel&apos;  annoys  a  large  number  of the middle and  influentialclasses, and  the  announcement of  a levee-en-masse of all.  able-bodied men to  fight for  the Germano-Turks  exasperates thewhole population.&apos;&apos;                         NOTES.Jebel Radhwah.     The following is contributed by Bimbashi Garland, who hastravelled recently from  Abu  Markha in Wacli Ais to  KheifHusein in Wadi Yambo :      &quot;I was told by two Arabs at  different  times that in JebelRadhwah  there lives a quite  distinct  tribe.   They are said tohave  gardens,  producing  everything  they  require, goats  andother animals.   They never  allow  an  outsider to  ascend theirJebel and  have no intercourse whatever with the outside world.They use neither money, nor  clothing, and are  said  to  be of asavage disposition.  Passing close to the Jebel one was unable tosee any of their settlements.     &quot;It rained quite heavily  on May 30, for the greater part ofthe day, and I think  this is  somewhat  late  for  rain in  thiscountry.&quot;The  fight between Rashidite and Sherifial forces.     At the fight mentioned in  our last issue (p. 269) it seems doubtful whether Ibn Rashid himself was present, but certainlyRashicl Ibn Leilah was there.  He  escaped.  The Sherifian forces were, it is  reported,  mainly  Hai-b   tribesmen  drawn  fromthe   Peridah   and  Zakara  (Dhikarah).   These   profess  tohave. lost  only one man.    According  to  Suleiman el-Dakhil,nephew of Jarullah of that- ilk,  Ibn  RashicVs former agent at baghdad (Suleiman left  Hail about six weeks ago), Rashid IbnLeilah is all-powerful with Ibn Rashicl, but, owing to scarcity offood  and supplies, the townsfolk and tribesmen, are turning moreand  more against him, and only need assurance of our continuancein Mesopotamia to force Ibn  Rashid to  come to terms  with us.The caravans which have got through from  Nejef brought much less  than was expected or is needed, and very little  is coming up from Kuweit.
 Operations at Salif.     The immediate object of! the naval attack  on Salif  (on the North Yemen coast near Kamaran  island),  which took place  on June 12, was to recover tbe  salt-refining and other plant belong- ing to Sir John  Jackson&apos;s Company.   Salif, which is the principal source of salt on the Red Sea coast, and the head of a caravan road to Central Yemen via tbe Wadi  Mur, was  fairly strongly held  by about a  full company  of Turkish regulars with two mountain guns and three&apos; machine guns.  The  district  has  been notorious  for some time as a centre  of blockade-running and aggressive action against our patrols.   Pending a fuller  report, we put on record that the place was captured after a three hours&apos; fight  with a loss to ourselves of one Royal Marine killed and two wounded.   The garrison lost six  killed and eight wounded and the balance  of  seventy-three  unwounded  men.  were captured. Besides these, two military and eleven civilian officials wereinade prisoners.   We held tbe place for two  days.  The salt-plant and lighters were found much deteriorated, by rust  and  neglect, and. little  was worth  removing except some pumps, which have  been shipped to Kamaran.   The distilling plant was dismantled.   All was finished  by (i p.m. on June  14, and the landing party and ships were withdrawn. Yemen Neics.     From news sent by Aden, under  date  June  13, it appears that much fighting has  taken  place, and  is still going on, in Yemen b jth  south  and north.  The liadaa,  district, up to  the borders &quot;f Yafa, is still occupied by Mohammed Seif-el-1.slam and an iniamite force of 1,500 men, which  was sent two  mouths ago to operate  against Juban,  Nawa  and Hubiatein.   The Mausata sheikhs have  had to watch their frontiers to prevent  trouble  with this  force.   The Taiz  district is thoroughly disturbed  chiefly through  the  combined action  of Ahmed Pasha with the new claimant to  the  Imamate,   Seyyid  Mohammed   Yahya.    The former is reported  to have lifted. L.T. 2,000 in bullion on its way to  Lahej  and  to  have turned some 2,000 Dim Mohammed and Dim Husein  tribesmen loose  into  the region.   The Badau Arabs also are said  to be joining Seyyirl Mohammed, who  has received dues  from  the greater part  of the  Hashid and the Bekil as well.as lesser tribes like  the Hamdan.  The  Imam  Yahya is stated to have  warned  the  Turks that they  are on the point  of losing  allTaiz.   In the north, Ibn el-Heij is reported  by  Kamaran to  havedefinitely  seceded  from the Turks and to  be co-operating  withIdrisi.  The  latter&apos;s action  against Ibn  Thawab and the Abstribesmen,  on  May .14, seems  to   have  been  a  serious  affairresulting in unusually heavy casualties.   Idrisi is reported to be steadily gaining  the upper hand.
