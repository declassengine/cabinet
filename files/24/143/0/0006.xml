SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT,  No. VI.                                   RotJMANIA,    Attention is drawn to the Roumanian crisis.                                 TALA&apos;AT PASHA.    The Turkish Grand Vizier&apos;s manoeuvres  require watching.  It may be -that heintends to anticipate a collapse of Turkish military resistance by provoking a revolutionagainst himself and then to control it.  The agent who makes the report is evidentlyvery well versed.in C.U.P. ways.    The danger to the Entente lies in the fact that the Germans and Turks havepossibly agreed that by such a trick they might keep Prussia out of Constantinople andso break up the Entente on the verge of victory.                                 IDRISI  OP ASIR.    The news regarding Idrisi is satisfactory ; he is probably influenced by our successesin. Egypt and the improvement of the King of Hejaz&apos;s  position.                                     HATL.    The Turkish withdrawal from  Hail, or even  the rumour thereof, is symptomatic ofthe improvement of the Arab position.                        INDIA  AND THE  ARAB MOVEMENT.    Not too much attention need be paid to Mubarik  Ali&apos;s move, though after all  thereports which were  received anticipating an upheaval in India on the King of Hejaz&apos;first entering  into  the war, it  is interesting to see an  Indian  Moslem coming  outopenly on the King&apos;s side.    However, we should beware of taking anj&apos;  part  in purely religious matters ;  our interest in the King of Hejaz is purely  on national grounds.    We should never forget that we practically invented the Ottoman caliphate, whichhas plagued us on many occasions.                  A GERMAN VERSION OE ARMENIAN ATROCITIES.    Due publicity should be given  to this.                          THE KING OF HEJAZ&apos;S TITLE.    Many official documents continue to refer  to the  King of Hejaz as  the  Sherif ofMecca.  This may give rise to confusion, and possibly may lead to misunderstanding.                                                                         M.  S.    March 8, 1917.       [898-33]

NOTE ON SMALL MAP OF TURKEY  IN  ASIA.     THE  map  shown  above has been prepared in order to demonstrate the politicalchange which would result in event of the Turkish forces  evacuating Baghdad.   Thered areas are those regions with the inhabitants of  which we have had direct political relations up to the present ; the green area  shows the region  with whose inhabitantswe shall be in a position to open relations  in event of  the Turks abandoning Baghdadand of our influence extending to that city.     It  is to be  noted  that  these areas  do not represent fields of certain  politicalsuccess, but of  political opportunity.  That  is  to say, that we can establish  com-lnunications with any  tribe  or political  element  in  the green area from Baghdad.The result of such communication naturally depends on      1.  Our success in the field.     2.  Our political policy.     3.  Our capacity to  find necessary money and arms in event of 1 and 2 contributing           to cement our friendly relations with the inhabitants of the green area.     However, as a matter of first-rate military political importance, it is to be notedthat from Baghdad we should be  in uninterrupted  communication with the tribes wholive within raiding  distance of  the Hejaz  Railway and  the Aleppo-Ras-ul-Ain branchof the Baghdad  Railway.

RUSSIA.                                   A Japanese Loan.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on  the 2nd and 4th March [Nos. 249, 255 and 260]that  the Russian Government was  on the  point of concluding  a 6  per cent, loan  of100 million yen [1 yen  =  24&apos;5d.] with, the  Japanese Government, who proposed that       [898-33]                                                              B
 it should be issued at 97^-.  Other conditions would make the loan work out at 7 per cent. The Russian Government had informed the Japanese Government  that the  conditions required  consideration :  its reason  for  this  being  that it  considered the  terms  too onerous and as likely to prejudice all future loans at Tokio.  In the meantime money was Urgently  needed, and the  Minister  for Foreign  Affairs had  asked the French Ambassador and Mr. Lindley to recommend  to their Governments that negotiations should be begun for a joint loan, of which 200,000,000 yen would be Russia&apos;s share. The Russian  Government  attach great importance to  joint action at  Tokio, which, Sir G. Buchanan says, seems to  be  in the interest of all  three  Allies, and from  the political point of view, as seen from Petrograd, is much to be recommended.                                   RUMANIA.                                    The  Grists.     The crisis in Rumania is still acute.  The following facts appear from  telegrams sent by Sir C. Marling from Jassy on the 27th February and 3rd March [Nos. 112 and 116], and by Sir G. Buchanan  from Petrogrnd  on the  2nd  and  3rd March [Nos. 251 and 258] :      1. The population of Rumania  is about  double what it. is in peace time, and the           food is only sufficient to last till the  end of April.     2. The Russian Government believes the  only solution to be the evacuation of the           Rumanian army, leaving the civil population alone.     3. As to which Sir G. Barclay is  of opinion that it would do nothing more than           prolong the crisis ; the evacuation of the army he says would only save from           300 to 400 tons of flour a day, and with all its political  disadvantages would           ouly slightly relieve the economic situation.     4. The Bidtish military attache at Petrograd suggested to the Rumanian Minister           that  the bulk  of  the army might be evacuated, leaving two  or three           divisions to hold the present front  of 24 kilometre : but the Minister, basing           his opinion on the advice of General Bertelot, opposed the idea, and  said           that only dep6ts amounting to some 60,000 men could  be evacuated,  and           such a small number would make no difference to the supply problem.     5. It seems  that the  railway  situation is being  taken  in  hand.   The railway           commission is  presided over by  a Russian, and a young and  energetic           Rumanian  director-general has replaced the indolent official  who occupied           the post till now.  A  considerable part of the rolling-stock has been removed           to Bukovina.   But even if this improvement continues, Sir G. Barclay says,           the situation must remain acute unless Russia can send a plentiful supply of           provisions.                            British Corn in Rumania.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 28th February [No.  240] that  he  had beeninformed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs that he had heard that the British minister was being pressed by the Rumanian Government to band over a large quantity of grainto it instead of to the Russian military authorities.   Against this the Foreign Ministerstrongly  protested, as he  had no  confidence in  the use the Rumanians would make ofthe grain.  The advantage of handing  over the grain to the Russians, Sir  G.  Buchanansaid, was that we could count on them destroying it in  case of necessity.  In regardto this  Sir G. Barclay  telegraphed  on the  3rd March [No. 116]  that giving part  ofour grain to the Russians  and  part to the  Rumanians  would make the keeping a record extremely difficult, and in some cases impossible.   He strongly recommendedthat all should be sold either  to Russia  or  to  Rumania, by preference to the latter,for reasons  he had already given.    If sold to Rumania  this  did not prevent the Russians  from destroying  it in case of retreat;  but in any case  there will  be hardly any left in a month&apos;s time.     Sir G. Barclay telegraphed again on the 4th March [No. 120] saying  that Captain Pitts had explained his position to the Minister  in charge of the food question, namely, that he had engaged himself to sell our remaining corn to the Russians, not knowing that a famine was imminent, and that Russia was now claiming the fulfilment of that engagement.  With this he asked that the Rumanian  authorities should take no more of our corn.  The Minister thought that only  20,000 waggons of our wheat  remained,the rest having been taken up  recently by Rumanian and  Russian troops; he would
 give the instructions asked for, but could not guarantee that the local authorities would -abstain from taking our corn wherever there was absolute necessity.                             TURKEY  IN EUROPE.                                   Talaat Pasha.     A reliable agent  says that Talaat  Pasha is reported to be approaching  certain &apos;Turkish ex-cabinet ministers and others, who have either taken no part in the Turkish programme since the war broke out, or are looked upon with a certain amount of favour by the Entente Powers.  His object appears to be the formation of a prospective  cabinet which will be  acceptable to the Entente when the negotiations with Turkey are com- menced, either at or before the Peace conference.   Talaat is well aware that the Entente will never treat with  himself, Enver Halil, or any other member of their clique, and his scheme is to strike a  bargain with, among others, Rifaat Pasha, formerly Minister of Foreign Affairs,  Naby Bey, formerly  Minister at Rome (both of whom are now at Geneva), Javid Bey, formerly Minister of Finance, and probably Rahmi Bey, vali of Smyrna, all of whom enjoy a certain amount of favour in England and France.     His scheme is to bring about a cabinet crisis as soon as he sees that it is necessary to negotiate with the Entente. The present pro-German  cabinet would then be replaced by the Entente group, who would, in reality, be the  tools of Talaat, by whom  their policy would be directed.   Peace declared,  and  the  future  of Turkey settled, Talaat would re-appear and take  charge of Turkish affairs.     It is not clear if Talaat is in accord with  Enver, but  probably he is working the scheme independently.     Talaat has the  support  of practically all the civilian  members  of  the Union and Progress party, as well as of a certain number of the older officers in the army.  Enver&apos;s following is confined almost entirely to the young military members of the party.     Rifaat had a long  interview quite recently with  several Turkish  members of the Union and Progress party, including Tewfik Bey, and with two Germans; rumour says that he will shortly  leave Geneva for Turkey to attend a conference.                                 Turks in Geneva.     Sir  H. Rumbold telegraphed on the  3rd  March  [No.  178] that  an agent in the confidence of the legation had given information to the  effect that an effort was being made  by Rifaat  Pasha and other Turks in Geneva to come into  contact wdth  Russian agitators with a view to peace  proposals : this is understood to mean an attempt by Germany to reach Russia through an Ottoman channel, direct negotiations with Russia having failed.   Rifaat  Pasha was recently at Feldkirch; where, it was said, he met various prominent Austrians.   The  move  at Geneva was believed to  be in agreement with Talaat, and it  was expected that the latter would  send Muktar Bey to Switzer- land.   Suleiman el  Bustani had  recently been at  Geneva, and this was of  some significance.   Sir H. Rumbold added that, till further information had been received, &quot; excessive importance should not be attached to the above report.&quot;                                   Miscellaneous.     Another agent reports that:      1.  Hakki Pasha, Turkish Ambassador at Berlin, has been called to Constantinople.     2. Jemal Pasha refuses to obey orders from Constantinople : he  is on bad terms           with the German officers the  Germans want him  to use all  his troops.           against the British on the Egyptian front, to which he is opposed.     3. The Turks are calling up all men from 16  to 60 years of age.                                 THE  SENUSSI.                              Exchange of Prisoners.     Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 3rd March [No.  218]  that Colonel  Talbot had reported,  under date the 22nd February, that the question of the  exchange of prisoners-appeared to be virtually settled ; that the  Italian prisoners had  been brought  from jalu to the neighbourhood of Gimenes [27 miles south of Benghazi];  and that Idrissi
 [who is recognised by us as the head  of the  Senussi] had  submitted proposals  for a modus vivendi, which in practice amounted to a request that until the troubles in the west are settled things should remain as they are, and that  meanwhile trade should be opened.   Colonel Talbot was of opinion that the Italians would be wise to accept.     Probably Sayed Ahmed [the Grand Senussi, no longer  recognised by us] will join Nuri, who is at Misurata [a district of Tripolitana,  100  miles east of Tripoli], trying to re-establish  Turkish authority with &apos;-&apos;  Defuui&quot; [probably intended for Suleiman Baruni, Turkish governor-general of the vilayet of Tripoli, &amp;c], and preaching Jehad against the Italians.  To meet these difficulties, Idrissi has  proposed that negotiations should be resumed  near Cyrene, and is sending Sayed Bida  to keep an eye on Sayed Ahmed,. who has not yet left Jaghbub.                                     ARABIA. HEJAZ.                                     Operations.     Sir  R.  Wingate  telegraphed on  the  28th  February [A.B.  848]  that  Midjz had been evacuated by the Turks, and was occupied by  Zeid.   Ali was advancing towards Bir-Abbas which he hoped to reach on the  8th March.   Garland was reported to  have blown up a  train, and  a bridge : probably this was the  same train  the blowing up of&quot; which had already been  reported.   On the 1st March he telegraphed [A.B. 880] that definite information showed that this train was going south.     In the  latter telegram he also said that Zeid had reported the occupation of Gadir Rabegh  by  his advanced guard:  the enemy was  retreating  and  the Arabs  were besieging Bir-el-Mashi.     On the 3rd March the Arab  Bureau telegraphed [A.B. 872] that a  report  dated the 17th February  had been received from  a French  Moslem  officer with  Abdulla that the  latter was camped  in Wadi  Ais and  had  received  letters  from  Nuri Shalan promising support and asking for money.     On  the 4th March Sir R. Wingate  telegraphed [A.B. 877] that: (1) Aeroplane had  reported that  Sherif Ali had reached Rir  Nasani; (2) he  had received reliable information  that before midnight on the 3rd March the  Hejaz railway had been cut at two  places, one south  of  Dar-el-Hamra, the other near Matali, in consequence of which a train going north from Medain Salih with a Turkish company was held  up.     On  the 6th March Sir R. Wingate  telegraphed [A.B. 896] that the damage to railway near Dar-el-Hamra, reported on the 4th March, was serious.   One repair  gang going south were all captured; another going north suffered casualties and prisoners. The station at Dar-el-Hamra was besieged.  Sherif Abdullah had reported four demolitions between Khassa (Hasse) and Jedaha,  including wrecking of bridge over Wadi Hamdl north of Abu-el-Naim, and capture of  the guard of twenty-two men.     On  the same  day  the Arab  Bureau  telegraphed  ! A.B. 898] that Sherif Nasir&apos;s force detached  by Feisal  carried out the attack on Dar-el-Hamra.  Line was  cut north and  south of station.  It was reported by sure source one of our aeroplanes reconnoitred station and  barracks outside Medina.   Garland stated in report on his demolition near Toweira  that he had to operate quite close to station and blockhouse owing to fault of guide.  Twenty-four Ageyl alone accompanied him,  Juheins hanging back.   Although train arrived earlier  than  expected,  charge  proved enough to  derail train,  which fell down embankment.  Charge on bridge south and two on line north were  subsequently fired  by an  Ageyl  which isolated  train.   Garland marched from Wej to Toweira in eight days&apos; slow riding.                        Congratulations from King Hussain.     Sir R.  Wingate  telegraphed  on the 3rd  March  [No. 219] -that  he  had  been requested by King Hussain to convey his  congratulations to His Majesty the King onthe brilliant news from Mesopotamia.AsiR.                                      Idrisi.     The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 1st March that his agent had returnedand  had reported  that  Idrisi was much  more amenable.   He seemed to be satisfiedabout the Farsan islands and  had not mentioned  Comfida.   He was prepared to come
 to an understanding with King Hussain, towards  whom his attitude was friendly ; he recognised that the King was hostile to the Turks.   He considered the  Imam to  be in favour of the Turks, and his feeling towards him were hostile.                             The Agreement with Idrisi.     Sir A.  Hirtzel,  on the 28th  February,  informed the  Foreign Office  that Mr. Chamberlain did not like the agreement, as, on paper at any rate, it placed very serious obligations on His majesty&apos;s  Government without exacting the  condition that  Idrisi should  follow the advice given him.  But as the agreement had been made, and certain desiderata had been secured thereby, he thought it might be politic to ratify it in due course  and to trust  to an opportunity  hereafter occurring which would enable our relations  with him to be placed on a  more  satisfactory footing.  In reply to this Sir Bonald Graham wrote on the 5th March that, in view of  the circumstances of the case, Mr. Balfour concurred in Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s view.   [See Eastern Beport,  IV,  p. 5.] JEBEL SHAMMAR.                    Withdrawal of Turkish Garrison from Hail.     The Arab Bureau telegraphed on the 3rd March [A.B. 871] that a French Moslem officer with Abdulla  reported on the 17th February that Ibn Rashid had warned the Turks that he could  do nothing  for them, and the Turkish garrison  had withdrawn from Hail.                                     SYRIA.                            Disaffection of the Druses.     An agent reports that the  Druses  of the Hauran are  causing the Governmenttrouble.                                    PERSIA.                      Occupation of Hamadan and Dowletabad.     Sir P. Cox telegraphed on the 4th March [No. 1628] that Colonel Kennion had reported that  the Turks  had evacuated Hamadan.  And on  the  5th March [No. 91]Sir C. Marling  telegraphed  that on the  previous  day the  Russians  had occupiedDowletabad.                                     Soulet.     Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 1st March  [No. 85] that Soulet had repeated hisoffer [see Arabian Report IV, p. 6], and that Colonel Gough had asked for authority tonegotiate with him.  In a further telegram sent on the 4th March [No. 88] he said thatit  had been suggested that if Soulefs. services were secured, it would be  possible toarrange for the Governor of Bushire to operate from the south against the rebel khans.Sir C. Marling believed that the combined operations,  coupled with the  effect of the news of the victory at Kut and the recapture of  Hamadan,  would canse the rebels tocollapse.                   The Telegraph from Bunder Abbas to Kerman.     The Viceroy telegraphed on the 5th March that 155 miles had been completed andDehsard reached.                                PERSIAN GULF.                     Suggestion that it should be a mare clausum.     Sir P. Cox telegraphed at considerable length on the  1st  March  [Nos.  1569 and1570]  recommending that the Persian  Gulf should be made a mare clausum, withsuggestions as to the proper mode of dealing with  the claims of Russia, France, and japan.  Failing the possibility of  this being done, he urged that German shipping should be  prohibited from entering the Gulf  ports for as long a time as possible, andthat during that period German commerce should be confined to such business, if any, as might  be done through British, or at least non-German,  firms.       [898-33]                                                         C  .
                                     INDIA.                    Feeling, in India in regard to the Arab Revolt.&apos;    The Indian General Stall reports that Mubarik Ali, a retired official of HyderabadState,  has  addressed a letter to Abdul Bari,  president of the notorious pan-Islamicsociety, Anjuman  anjumankhuddam-i-Ka&apos;aba,  at Lucknow,  in which he  describes how,  onhearing the news of the Arab revolt, he proceeded to Arabia in order to see for himselfthe state  of affairs in Hejaz.  He had an interview with King Hussaifi, to whom he made certain proposals, which he now publishes.   He suggests that an  association ofMohammedans of all  countries,  similar in organisation to the Anjuman  anjumankhuddam-i-Ka&apos;aba, should be  founded for the purpose of defending the holy places  of Islam and supporting the King&apos;s claims  to the caliphate.   This association should request  theTurks to get rid of the Germans who are fighting with them at Medina ;&apos;  if the Turksrefuse, it snould ask the British Government to send Mohammedan troops to help theKing,  and, if necessary, should  raise money to  pay for them.  He also suggests thata deputation of men learned in the Koran  snould  be sent  from India to  congratulateKing Hussain, and that the funds  in the hands of the Anjuman anjumankhuddam-i-Ka&apos;abashould be placed at his disposal for the relief of the destitute  inhabitants  of the  holy places.                                   The Mahsuds.    The Viceroy telegraphed  on the 4th March that there was a large armed gatheringnear  Sarwekai,  under  Mullah Fazl Din, who  was  said to have a letter urging  theMahsuds to unite and rise, and promising help from Kabul.   This  letter, which was signed by Nasrulla Khan, might be a forgery ;  if  genuine, the  Indian Government  felt sure that it was sent without the cognisance of the Amir. Fazl Din was taking advantageof the temper of hostile sections, being obviously anxious  to  establish his position inthe tribe by a  signal  act of hostility to the Government.   The necessary  militaryprecautions were being taken.                                AFGHANISTAN.                                Internal Conditions.    The Secretary of State for India has asked the Viceroy  to send a monthly reportof the state of Afghanistan for the information of Sir G. Buchanan, in view of Russiannervousness.  The Viceroy telegraphed on the 1st  March that the internal conditions were normal and quiet.  Reports pointed to the Amir having  recently taken a  strongstand against Nasrulla  and. the war party.  Whilst  recognising the difficulty  of the amir&apos;s task,  and the necessity  of avoiding all provocative action on  the north-west frontier, the Government of India was quite satisfied with the present situation.PART  II.                            The Young Arab Movement.  [This is taken from the translation of a German pamphlet on &quot; Syria and Germany&apos;s                           Task,&quot; by one Blanckenhorn.]     For some time past  an intellectual movement, which it  is  too late to check, hasbeen proceeding in Asia Minor ;  by skilful manoeuvring it may, however, be divertedinto harmless channels.   This national movement aimed at uniting the widely differentArab-speaking  elements of the population  and at liberation from  the supremacy  ofTurkey.     The way  of  this movement was paved in  the first instance by the educationalreform and the literary renaissance of the Arabian language, partly  brought about by american missionaries;  then came the French intrigues and the propaganda work  ofthe Jesuits, together with the establishment of  countless French schools all over thecountry&apos;;&quot;and finally the English, aided by their  money-bags, organised ah anti-Turkishagitation, laying stress on  the  prosperous condition of  Egypt,  which they,  of course,attributed entirely to English rule.   The very  natural  desire  of improvement  of theadministration and of all the economic conditions&apos; first took the form  of demanding
national reforms which  aimed  at decentralising or weakening the rule of Turkey,establishing provincial governments, and appointing foreigners to give advice and  to inspect the different government departments, such as finance, the levying of taxes, the postal system, and the police; these demands were more definitely  formulated  in the syrian centre of intellectual  life and Christianity, the  great trading  city  of Beirut;they form the so-called Beirut programme of reform.    The young Arabs of the  opposition party did not realise that these separatist effortswere actuated by a conscious attempt on the part of France and England to stir  up thepeople and prepare them for a break with Turkey, nor that an actual rebellion  wouldsimply play into the hands of the two foreign Powers, since the expulsion of the  Turks would practically lead to the partition of Asia Minor into English and French colonies.                           Turkish Atrocities in Armenia.    The February number of &quot;Armenia &quot; contains the first part of  a  translation  of apamphlet (published by the  Geneva Committee of Relief among Armenians) recording the impressions of Dr. Martin Niepage, an upper master in the Royal German School  atAleppo.  When Dr. Niepage returned to Aleppo in September  1915 he  &quot; heard withhorror of the commencement of  a new period  of  Armenian  massacres,  much moreterrible than those  during the reign of Abdul Hamid, their object being to exterminatethe Armenian nation, an intelligent and industrious people, eager for progress,  and  topass into the hands of the Turks all their possessions.&quot;  He was at first incredulous, but could not resist the evidence gathered by personal  investigations; when convinced,he and some of his  colleagues sent a formal report to the German authorities.  In this the following passage occurs :          &quot; Whereas the convoys of the deported at the time of their departure  from    Upper  Armenia were reckoned at two or three thousand  men, women, and children,    they are reduced to two or three hundred on their arrival  in the south.  The men    are killed on the way, the women and the young girls (excepting the old, the ugly,    and the very little children)  are violated by the Turkish soldiers and officers, and    then they disappear  in the Turkish and Kurdish villages,  where they are made to    accept Islam.  The rest of the convoys are decimated by hunger and thirst.   Even    when  passing  a stream, they are  not allowed to drink.   The only nourishment    these people are allowed daily is a little flour, poured into their hands, which they    devour greedily, and this only helps to retard death.  Opposite our school, in one    of these khans, are to be found the remnants of one of these convoys of the deported,    about four hundred emaciated creatures, amongst whom  are a hundred children of     5 to 7 years of age.  The majority of these are ill with typhus and dysentery.    When one enters  the yard, one feels like being in  a lunatic asylum.   When food    is  brought, one sees  that  these  creatures have  forgotten how to  eat.   Their    stomachs, grown weak by a fast of months, can no longer sustain nourishment.  If    one gives them bread they put it aside with indifference ; there they lie stunned,    awaiting death.&quot;PRINTKD AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY  C. E. HARRISON.-8/3/1917.
