SECRET.APPRECIATION OF  THE  ATTACHED  EASTERN REPORT, No. XXV.                                     RUSSIA.     THERE is nothing of moment in the official news  covering the  crisis in Russiawhich is not in  the  daily newspapers.   The  events  are  obscure  and  confused, butapparently such organisation as exists lies  in the  hands  of  elements  more  or lesspredisposed in favour of a Government and national existence as opposed  to  the purelyanimal and anarchistic forces.                                     EGYPT.     The correspondence regarding the ex-Khedive should be noted.                                     ARABIA.     The exploit of Captain Lawrence gains in importance.   This officers extraordinaryperformance shows signs of having set alight  the Arab movement in Syria, and so givingthe Turks anxiety  in regard to the communications on which their Gaza forces dependfor supply.     This is an important change in the situation.   Hitherto our operations  in  Sinaiand near Gaza have added to the safety of the King of Hejaz;  his  followers andsympathisers, under the stimulus of Captain Lawrence&apos;s personality, are now  giving a material contribution to  the operations of the Egypt  force.

Buchanan telegraphed  on the 16th  July [No.  1079]that  he believed  the following account  of what had taken place to be more or lesscorrect, though he had  not received any official information.   MM. Terestchenko andTseretelli, who had been  sent to negotiate with the leaders of the Ukraine movement,returned to Petrograd on Sunday last.  They brought with them a declaration grantingcomplete autonomy to the Ukraine, and recognising the Rada as a parliament, and thegeneral secretariat as a  Government responsible to the Rada, but there was no precisedefinition of the territorial  limit of the  Ukraine.   They insisted on the acceptance  ofthis by the Government, and were supported, on military grounds, by  M. Kerensky.The declaration was eventually  adopted by  a majority of five, the Cadet  Ministers,Nickrassoff excepted, having opposed it on the grounds that it was loosely worded, thatthe rights of the Central Government were not provided for, that  it would lead  otherjorovinces to put  forward like  demands, with the result that Russia would be split up into a number  of autonomous States before the Constituent Assembly had met, and thatto accept the declaration  would be a  usurpation of the authority of that Assembly.  TheCadets were also  actuated by the view that they would sooner or later  be obliged  to resign on another  question if they did not resign on this one.  The Cadet Ministers  ofFinance, Education,  Social  Welfare,  and  Commerce   (acting)  had  resigned,  but . Nickrassoffs position  was uncertain ; he had refrained from voting though he wasin favour of the declaration.  Sir  G. Buchanan added that there was no alternative  tothe formation of a Socialist Ministry, as the decision of the Cadets appeared to be final.The explanation of the Ukrainian movement lay in the fact that  the focal populationfeared that  their lands would be disposed of by the Constituent Assembly.     Sir G.  Buchanan telegraphed again  on  the same day [No.  1084]  saying that hehad discussed the  crisis with M. Terestchenko, who criticised the attitude of the Cadets,which he said had  been inspired by M.  Miliukoff   The  agreement negotiated by him and M. Tseretelli was (? he&apos; said) altogether satisfactory.  It  had  been arranged that       [898-52]*Russia.   Ministerial Crisis.   Mi ssage  from  Mr.  Lloyd George to  Prince    LvoS.

the Rada should be reformed by the  admission  of delegates of other national groups,and no concession had been made in military matters.   The Ukrainians had agreed notto put any new laws in force till the  meeting of the  Constituent  Assembly; and the names of persons selectee! to act as members of the administration were to be approvedby the Central Government, who, if it wished, could substitute  other  names.   Theywould, in all matters affecting the administration and the local life of the province, actfor the Central Government, whose agents they would be.  M. Terestchenko  did not*\anticipate any serious consequence from the secession of  the Cadets,  and said that  he believed that in future only one of the vacant offices would carry Cabinet rank.    Message from Mr. Lloyd  George to  Prince Lvoff. Mr.  Lloyd  George sent thefollowing message to Prince Lvoff through Sir G. Buchanan on the 13th July :  Pleaseaccept the heartiest congratulations of the British Government on the  success of theBussian offensive.   It is a splendid tribute to the  practical wisdom and determination of the Russian Government and people that only a few months after  the revolutionwhereby they won freedom  for themselves they should have struck so great a blow forthe freedom of the world.  This news, coming as it does in the last phase of tbe greatbattle against autocratic rule, has  been an immense  encouragement  to  us all;  for it shows that free Bussia clearly sees that there can be no lasting  peace, and no recon-struction of the world on better lines, until  Serbia, Belgium, and the other despoilednations have been rescued from the blasting tyranny  of military despotism, and untilthe responsibility of Governments to their peoples has been clearly established from oneend of Europe  to the  other.   I  should be  much obliged  if you would convey mycongratulations to the Minister for War for  the brilliant part he  has played in thisglorious triumph of the Russian arms.    Sovyet   Delegation   [see  Eastern   Report  XXIV,  p.  1]. Sir  G.  Buchanantelegraphed on the .10th July [No. 1057] that he had  been informed that the delegateswould be  Joseph  Goldenberg, Vladimir  Rosanov,  Alexander Smirnov, and  HenryEhrlich, and the Russian Government had, requested  that  facilities should be  given them  on their arrival in England.   On  the 12th July Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed  toSir E.  Howard [No.  2176] instructing  him to  arrange for the transport of thesedelegates and to inform the Russian  Minister that, on their landing here, all facilities would be given to them.    The Seamen&apos;s and Firemen s  Union and the Sovyet. Mr. Balfour  telegraphed toSir G. Buchanan on the  14th July [No. 1497] that the Seamen&apos;s and Firemeirs union was still anxious that their delegates  should go to Petrograd in spite of its havingdefinitely refused to carry Mr. Ramsay Macclonald; in reply to which  Sir G. Buchanantelegraphed [No. 1086] on the  16th July that he  feared  that  if the delegates  should visit Petrograd  after definitely refusing to carry Mr.  Macdonald they would meet witha very bad reception on the  part, of the Sovyet and  of the Socialists in  general.  Ifthey should visit Petrograd without Mr. Macdonald we should be accused of only allowingpersons who represented  the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government  to visit Russia, andit was very  necessary to refrain from  any step likely  to  provoke attacks on us at a mount when the Government was in course of  being reconstructed.FINLAND.    General Situation. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 7th July [No. 1043] thathe feared that the situation in Finland was  becoming serious.  M. Terestchenko had said that the Finns,  in order  to afford a  pretext to  Sweden to intervene for  theestablishment of order, seemed to have purposely provoked the Russian troops, though he admitted that the conduct  of  the latter  had given just cause for complaint.  It wasimpossible under present conditions to leave Petrograd exposed to the danger of attack and the coast of Finland undefended; but the Finns wanted to get rid of the russian troops altogether.   Delegates had been sent by the Sovyet and by the Peasants&apos; Councilto reason with the Finns and, as the Finns refused to accept Russian money, to arrangefor a  loan covering the  expenses  of  the  army  in Finland, but the conditions attachedby the Finns to  the proposed loan were  quite  unacceptable, and their efforts had been unsuccessful.  A disquieting fact  was that the  Russian troops in  Finland were  readyenough to commit acts of violence, but could not be relied on to obey orders or maintaindiscipline in the event of a resort to coercive measures.    Telegraphing again on the 12th July [No. 1067], Sir G.  Buchanan said that the
Finnish  Diet the night before passed a  Bill extending  the rights of the  finnish government.  The Bill, which was to come up for the third reading  on the 14th July,was to the following effect :     1. The Finnish Diet will enact and put in force all laws respecting Finns, including those dealing with taxation  and  customs, and will decide all other Finnish questionsformerly determined by the Grand Dnke except those pertaining to foreign policy andmilitary matters.    2. The Diet will assemble without special summons and determine the length of session until the establishment of the new form of administration.  The Diet shallhave the right to order fresh elections and  to fix the date of dissolution.    3. The  Diet  shall appoint the executive authority  in  Finland.   The  supremeexecutive authority shall pertain temporarily to the  economic department of the FinnishSenate, the numbers  (? members)  of which shall be appointed  and dismissed by  the diet.    This Bill will go from the Diet to the  Senate (? where; its fate is ( ?-uncertain).   InPetrograd, the press, with the exception of the extreme section, condemned the Bill and considered that no further alterations in the  status of Finland should be made beforethe Constituent  assembly met.    General Strike. On the  17th July Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 1518] to Sir  G.Buchanan saying that the  Admiralty had been informed that there was a great strike in Finland and that no trains  were passing through.  Sir G. Buchanan was instructedto report whether the railway communication with Norway was  in fact cut.                                   RUMANIA.    Resignation of Conservative Members  of the Cabinet. Sir G. Barclay telegraphedon the 8th July  [No. 355]  with reference  to his telegram of the 4th July  [EasternReport XXIV, p. 2], that the Conservative members of the Cabinet (one of them beingM. Take  Jonescu) had resigned, and, further, had declared that the;y  would not serve under  the present  Prime  Minister.   The King wanted a Coalition Cabinet, but was unwilling to part with the present  Prime Minister.   Sir G. Barclay also said that whenhe had seen the Prime Minister on the previous day,  he  found  him  disposed  to resign  rather than make concessions likely to satisfy the Conservatives, and thoughmatters could probably be settled  satisfactorily by his  getting rid  of  the Minister forWar  and  the  Minister for  the  Interior.   Telegraphing again  on the  14th. July[No. 366], Sir G. Barclay said there had been  negotiations for a settlement,  and  thatM. Take  Jonescus  final demands   were  that  the  Ministers  for War  and the Interiorshould leave the Cabinet, and  that M. Bratiano should resign in favour of himself either the Premiership  or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.   M. Bratiano, after trying to induceM. Take  Jonescu to abate these terms, definitely rejected them.                                     EGYPT.    The  Ex-Khedive [see  Eastern Report XVI, p. 6 ;  XVIII,  p. 5 ;  XXI, p. 2].-sir h. Rumbolcl telegraphed on the 2nd July [No.  546] that the Ex-Khedive, in view of thestrained relations between himself  and his uncle, the Sultan Hussein, took exception tothe clause in the terms of settlement requiring his public  recognition  of his uncle by name,  but  otherwise  seemed willing to  accept  the conditions.  On the  5th JulyMr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 642] that the words &quot;my uncle&quot; might be omitted,but that itwas essential that he should recognise the  Sultan by name.   On  the  14th July sir h.  Rumbold again  telegraphed [No. 579] that  Lord  Acton had been informed byChedid Bey that  the  Ex-Khedive still  refused  to accept  the  clause  in  question;whereupon Lord Acton told  him  that the negotiations must be regarded as closed.Chedid then said that it was proposed to send an&apos; agent  to London to  discuss the pointwith His Majesty&apos;s Government.   Sir H. Rumbold said that it was  evident  that  the reservation of the clause had only  been an excuse for spinning out  the negotiations inthe hope of getting better terms either from us or from the Turks.    In an earlier telegram [No.  550] Sir H. Rumbolcl said  that  Lord  Acton had beeninformed  on the 5th July by Jean Tueni Bey that a  fortnight earlier  he had beenasked by  the Ex-Khedive to accompany him to Constantinople in connection  with  therecent  Turkish policy to erect  an autonomous province of Syria (the prospective Vice-royalty of which had been offered to Abbas Hilmi)  to counterbalance the  newly-created
Kingdom of Arabia.  Sir H.  B/umbold added  that he had been &quot;informed  by AbdelMoneim, son of the Ex-Khedive, that towards the  end  of June his father had urgedhim&apos; to return  to Turkey, Avhich he had refused to do.                                  ABYSSINIA.     The  German Mission to French Somaliland  [see Eastern  Beport, XXIV, p. 3]. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Mr. Thesiger on the 14th July [No. 48] instructing him to-join his Italian and French collegues in demanding  that the German Mission  should bedisarmed by the Abyssinian Government if it should enter its territory, when  thosecolleagues had received similar instructions.   Mr. Balfour  added that if the activitiesof the Mission were further  tolerated, such toleration would amount to a violation of neutrality.  [See Somaliland,  infra.&apos;]     Arrest of the  Prime  Minister. Mr.  Thesiger telegraphed  on the  14th July[No. 46] that  Ras had arrested Haili Giorgis, the  Prime Minister, for further oppositionto  himself; Ras had  thereby greatly strengthened  his  position, and  his action was generally approved.   Mr. Thesiger said that provided the  Powers were agreeable to  theconditions this should increase the possibility of expelling tbe Germans.    . The  Bequest  for Aeroplanes [see Eastern Report XXIII, p. 6, XXIV, p.  3]. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 13th July [No. 734] that in his opinion there shouldbe an acceptance of the terms of the Abyssinian Government.     Sir R. Rodd telegraphed  on  the 12th July [No. 623] in regard to Mr. ThesigePstelegram of the 2nd July  [Eastern Report XXIII, p. 6], saying  that  Baron  Sonninohad informed  him that he was not sure that  it was not to our advantage at presentthat the Abyssinians should be fully occupied with  their  internal  affairs.  His feeling was still against furnishing  the Abyssinian Government  with arms ; and he  did  not anticipate, in regard  to the  existing  situation,  that  much harm would  come to us.Sir R. Rodd added,  however,  that he  thought that  Baron Sonnino might modify his-view if  the proposal were approved by Plis Majesty&apos;s Government and valid arguments for its acceptance submitted.                                 SOMALILAND.     The  German &quot;Mission&quot;  [see Eastern  Beport, XX, p.  4, XXII, p. 4, and XXIV,.p. 3 (under Abyssinia)]. Lord Bertie  telegraphed  on the 10th July [No. 669] that hehad been informed  hj the  French  Government that  British military aid  was  not considered necessary for the  present,  as from information  received from the FrenchGovernor it appeared that  the mission was obliged to return to Abyssinia on accountof  lack  of food,  and  in  any case  the Governor was  believed to have  sufficienttroops to stop  it.  Though British aid was not required, the  French Government, on theoff-chance of the mission reaching the coast and trying to  cross to Arabia, thought thatit would be well for the naval  authorities to maintain the active surveillance of the red sea.  [See Abyssinia, supra.]                                    ARABIA.     The  Bed  Sea Blockade  [see  Eastern Beport, XXIV, p. 5], The  President at aden telegraphed on  the 6th July [401 A.P.], in reply to Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s  telegram to the Viceroy of the 5th July in regard to the statements of the  Italian Government.The original blockade extended from Jazan to the Aden littoral, and this had  been inexistence  since November  1915;  the only change  had been the tightening up of  theblockade.   In  April last the district affected was  extended to Ahwan  and two months later to  Makalla.HEJAZ.     The Arab Legion. The  question of the formation of an Arab Legion  has beenunder discussion since the end of April, when it was first  proposed  by Sir Mark Sykes.On the 13th July Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir  R. Wingate [No. 717] asking for  hisobservations on the question, after consultation, if he thought it desirable, with GeneralClayton.  Mr. Balfour said  that he himself found  some  difficulty in deciding betweenopposing views.  The scheme, in which M.  Picot concurred,  was that a force should beraised and trained under the auspices of the Anglo-French Mission, and should be paid for  by that Mission if it were employed outside of Hejaz,  being controlled by  thecommander of the force with which it co-operated ; but when, as was primarily intended,
    it should be employed for the defence of Hejaz, it should be controlled by the King, and    should not have either European officers or European instructors.   It would be mostjg)  desirable, Mr. Balfour said, to provide King Hussein  with an organised  force for the    defence of his country, and we would gladly raise troops for  that  purpose, but French    pretensions in Hejaz would be encouraged by the  existence of a force partially recruited    from and largely officered by Arabs  from the French  sphere, with French  sympathies  I  And in part trained by the  French ;  and not only this, it  would also  give them  a    claim  to  employ the force  elsewhere in furtherance of  French ambitions in Syria or    Palestine, though the  entire expense of the force  whilst in Hejaz would  have  fallen    upon us, and the great bulk of the force itself would have been raised from our prisoners.    That being so, he should have himself preferred  a force  confined to service under the    King of Hejaz,  and raised and trained by ourselves.  But it was urged that this change    would be impossible, as we were too far committed to the joint plan.        In reply Sir B. Wingate telegraphed on the 16th July [No. 748] that the objections    quoted in Mr. BalfouPs telegram had not weighed with  him  ; he  neither thought that    the Legion  would become an  instrument in French hands to our detriment nor that it    was likely  to  have French sympathies.   His   own  fear was that,  owing  to  Arab    suspicion of French political aims, the recruitment and. management  of  the  legionaries    would be complicated by French participation, and  that  the opposition to the French,    which it was our desire and policy to allay, would be stimulated.   These  apprehensions    of  the Arabs would be lessened, and the  organisation of the force correspondingly    expedited, if it  were raised  primarily for service  with King Hussein&apos;s levies and by us.    Captain  Lawrence has provided a new argument  in favour of French participation by    his suggestion that eventually units of the Legion might co-operate in the Hauran with    the Bedouin  raiders whom  Faisal hoped to organise.   Sir  II. Wingate expressed the    opinion  that, in  spite of attendant drawbacks,  the formation of the Legion,  on  a    co-operative basis, was preferable to the indefinite postponement of the scheme.        He  added that General Allenby would doubtless telegraph direct;  he  had not been    able to consult him, but had forwarded a copy of  this telegram.  -  Asir.        The  Visit of Mustaffa-al-Idrisi  [see Eastern Report XXII, p. 4].- -The Resident    at Aden telegraphed on the 1 2th July [406 A. P. ] that he  had  seen  Mustaffa-al-Idrisi    and discussed  his  coming  visit to  Idrisi ;  Mustaffa urged that  on the present    occasion he  should only aim at persuading Idrisi to pay a friendly visit to King Hussein,    no  question being raised as  to  the  recognition of the latter as &quot;leader of the  Arab    movement,&quot; as this might  wreck any friendly overtures.   The  Resident said that    he  agreed  with this.   He  had impressed  on Mustaffa  that our idea was  solely to    establish  friendly relations  in the Arab  interest  against the Turk, and found that he    was of opinion that  Kunfida was the main obstacle to  this : he had also impressed on    him that there w^as no idea of a settlement of territorial boundaries that  must  wait    till the end of the war.                                        PERSIA.        Relations with  Great  Britain [see  Eastern  Report XXII,  p.  4, XXIII, p. 4]. -In    answer  to  a request  from Mr.  Balfour [No. 187 ; 7th July] for suggestions  for  a    constructive policy of reform, Sir C.  Marling telegraphed on  the 9th  July [No. 236]    saying that as in  Persia politics w?re  a  matter of  money-making,  and  the hostile    element  would represent any  attempt  to encourage  reform as further evidence of    interference,  he submitted  that our  efforts  should be confined to endeavouring to    secure at least a real benevolent neutrality, and  to  inducing  the  Persian Government    to  acquiesce in the South  Persian  Rifles  being  under  British officers at least till the    end of the war.  Having these  objects in view, he suggested the reopening of the    conversations on the agreement with the intention of dropping the  proposal for financial    control but of Coming to terms on the question of the  Rifles.  In regard to the  latter    he  understood  that the Cabinet  was about to  approach us with a proposal for the    immediate formation of a single gendarmerie force for the whole of Persia under neutral    officers, the South  Persian Rifles  being absorbed at the end of the war.   We could    stipulate for the right of  vetoing  the engagement  of objectionable  officers and of    demanding their dismissal at any time ;  but, he thought  it  very improbable  that in the    present Condition of the Treasury any real progress would be made with the  scheme-        As to the moratorium  payments, he said that  none had been made since April;    when  the question  did come up, the  Persian   Government would  probably ask for          [898-52]                                                           C
payment in currency, but he thought that till there was some proof of friendliness thisshould not be conceded.     In regard to the  1907  Convention,  he said that the scrapping thereof would encourage Persia to recommence the old  game  of playing  off Russian against Britishinterests ;  whereas  if we maintained it Russian agents  could, to  at any rate someextent, be prevented from lending themselves to  such  tricks.   He  was therefore, afterreflection, averse to scrapping.     By working on these lines, he thought that we could do a  good deal to  reinstateourselves in Persian opinion, but other positive  results would not be great.  We mightcheck  the  anti-British  current, but could  not reverse it our  long association withRussia  made  us  suspect, and, in addition, Persian opinion  inclined  to Turkey  in  thepresent struggle.   Till,  however, the  issue  was.settled,  it  seemed clear that  Persiawould  not commit herself, though in any event her effort would count for little.                                     INDIA.     The Mahsuds. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 10th  July [P. 2833]  that on  theprevious day  the  Mahsud jirga,representative of all sections, had  accepted on behalfof the tribe a settlement on the lines indicated in  his telegram of the 4 th July [EasternReport XXIV, p. 6].   The Indian  Government  undertook to  release prisoners  otherthan those imprisoned for military offences, to restore allowances  from the date  of  theconclusion of peace which allowances would become actually payable six  months later and  not to  make, in  the unprotected tribal area, new  roads or  ports.   The jirgahanded in 124 rifles and gave  hostages for  the  balance, which  they  promised to handover on the second day after the Id.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.                                    RUSSIA.    Outbreak in Petrograd. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 17th July [No. 1090]that the situation in Petrograd again became acute on Monday night last.  A demon-strafion was directed against the Government, caused, it was said, by the refusal ofM.  Kerensky to allow men of over  40  years of age to return home for harvest work.About 8  o&apos;clock requisitioned motors and. motor-lorries, filled with  machine guns and armed men, made  their  appearance;  then  about an  hour later  a large crowd  of workmen and four regiments, completely aimed, having  crossed the Neva, paraded theprincipal streets.  A  party  of  soldiers  went to the house  of Prince Lvoff with  theintention of arresting Ministers, but. in fact, oniv requisitioned their motors.  In somestreets the crowd attempted to stop the lorries  and to  arrest the  occupants,  but  theGovernment made no attempt to  restore order  beyond holding  itself in readiness at two points.   The number  of casualties  is  not known,  but  it appeared to have been.heavy ; in some quarters there was constant  machine-gun and rifle firing.   At a latehour  the  Government  issued an  order forbidding  armed  demonstrations, but that morning [17th  July] they  had recommenced, being  made against the express ordersboth &quot;of  the executive  committee  of  the Leninites  and  of the  Sovyet;  be  (Sir  G.Buchanan) had just heard that ships were  arriving-with  a large reinforcement for therioters from Kronstadt.  The Government would have to choose between capitulationand defending itself by force.    Telegraphing again later on the same day [No. 1092] he said that M. Terestchenkohad told him that, though  the Government  was  determined  to restore order, as it hadnot the necessary force in Petrograd, it could not do so at once.   Two or three daysmight elapse before it could take strong  action, as it  was bringing  up, from the front,troops which could be relied on.    Ministerial Crisis. Sir  G. Buchanan, telegraphing on the 17th July [No. 1092],said that the real reason for the resignation of the Cadets seemed to have been the factthat they had to assume responsibility for  measures  of  which they disapproved, theybeing nearly always in a minority  of four ;  the Ukraine question was, it seemed, onlythe last straw.
     Military  Service Agreement [see  Eastern Report XIX, p. 3; XXIII, p.  2], Sir G. Buchanan, on the 16th July [No. 1081] telegraphed the text of the  agreement which had been signed on that day.  The following is a translation : -     The Government of His Britannic  Majesty and the Russian Provisional Govern-ment, being convinced that it is to the interest of their countries, for  the better carryingon of the present war, that British subjects living in Russia and Russian subjects living inGreat Britain should  either return to their own country, to there perform their militaryduty in the ranks of  its army, or should  be  enrolled in that  of the country of then-residence, have made the following agreement:      1.  The Government of His Britannic Majesty and the Russian Provisional Govern-ment will call upon such of their subjects as may be living in Russia or Great Britainrespectively, but belonging  to the classes called to the  colours in their native land, toreturn thereto.     2.  The Government of Plis Britannic Majesty undertakes, so far  as may be possible,to provide for the transport of the above-mentioned persons by sea during  the summer of 1917.     3.  Such  of these persons as, after having been duly warned, may  refuse to returnto their country either at  their own expense or by taking advantage of the  meansprovided by article 2  of this agreement, shall be  obliged to  serve  in the army of thecountry in which they reside.  The call to arms of these  persons shall  be  made by thecompetent authorities of their  country  of residence,  who for that purpose will  apply the regulations in force in that country for dealing with the contumacious.     4.  Persons  who  produce  documents granted  by their diplomatic  or consularauthorities  certifying their freedom  from military  service will be exempt from the compulsory call  provided for in the preceding article.     5.  This agreement will come to an  end with the present war.                                    TURKEY.     Agreement  with  Germany. An agent  reports  that he  has received information from a trustworthy source to the effect that  Talaat  Pasha concluded two agreements with Germany when  he was in Berlin recently.  By one of  them Germany agreed thatthe guns, ammunition, and  supplies which it had  sent to Turkey should be regarded asa free gift; and by the other, Germany undertook that, unless Turkey were given backwhat she had lost in  Mesopotamia, Arabia, and elsewhere, she would not  make peacewith the allies.

ARABIA.                           Hejaz.                            Llth.    The  following  notes  have  been  Burnished  to  the naval authorities by Lieutenant G. W. Murray of  the  TopographicalSection,  G.H.Q., who  was attached as Political  Officer  to  theLith Survey.   The prohibition of landing during  the latter partof  the   Snrvey&apos;s   operations   limited   Lieutenant   Murray&apos;sopportunities of acquiring information, but he has used those hehad  very  well  to  increase our  knowledge of a. previously veryill-known district, and very obscure tribes :      &quot;Lith  (&apos;dense grass&apos;) is a poor town  of from  1,500 to2,000  inhabitants, about  (SO  miles due south  of  Mecca and 120from  Jiddah by  the coast road.   The inhabitants reckon it four days journey to both places and  the same  to Tail!.   The)&apos; are a colony  of  Hadharim  (people  of  Iladraniant) from  southern.Arabia,  not  on  the  best  of terms  with the  Dhawi  HasanBedouin,  by whom  they are surrounded.   They, in common with  tbe natives of the. whole district, have a peculiar habit ofsucking  the teeth while speaking, and saying  &apos; ilia&apos; (maybe) for&apos; aiwa&apos; (yes), which strangers at once remark.   The Sheikh ofthe  Hadharim  is  Sala Irlarhn.   The  Sherif  at the time of  our first visit (January  1917) was  Nasir Ibn Hazza, who was replacedlater, during his absence in. Mecca, by one  Sultan.  &apos; He maintainsa  local garrison  of seventy-two  soldiers,  among them ten ortwelve Ageyl from Nejd,  who are paid six pounds monthly and supply their own camels (very good ones).   The other soldiers,mostly men from Bishab,  serve for  their  food  or very little  pay.All are armed  with modern English rifles.     &quot;The buildings, from the Sherifs residence downwards, areof  the poorest description, being  either low mud  houses orconical straw huts.   The only two-storeyed building serves as themosque,  and there  are also five or six  shops, one  a silversmith^.The Imam, a pro-Turk, is the only educated man in the town.     &quot;The town stands on  an island in  the  Wadi Lith (dry, exceptafter  rain) and obtains its  water from  a large well, about fourfathoms  deep, in the western branch, which affords an apparentlyinexhaustible  supply.  Wadi Lith.  is  the continuation of WadiSillarna.  itself  formed by the  confluence of  Wadis Ghara andSafra  from  the north and  east; after  passing the  town, itcontinues  in  a southerly direction till  it reaches the sea about800 yards east of the  palm-grove at Riadha.     &quot; There is a dense grove of palms to the north of the town,and after rain the country to the east is sown with dura, dukhn,and  water-melons  in a broad belt stretching at least  as far south as the Khalig Hasan,  which enters the sea, at Raka.
     &quot; Mersa Ibrahim,  so  called from the  weli  who lies  buriedthere, is about a mile  and a half to the west of  the town, and isnow practically deserted.   The mosque and minaret  mentionedin former  sailing&apos;  directions have  fallen  down,  and  since  the departure  of the  Turkish  garrison  the  barracks  have  been abandoned and tbe blockhouses destroyed.     &quot;There- are  no supplies or  water  at the  port  itself andeverything has to be fetched from the town.     &quot; Dhawi Hasan j  a tribe of  Sherifial  descent, inhabit  thecoast from just north of Lith to a point near Jelajil.   Accordingto  Mohammed  Hujeir, a relative  of  the Sheikh of the  BeniMehidi, the sub-sections with their  chiefs are as follows : (*)  Sub-Sectton*.                           Chiefs.

South  of the Dhawi  Hasan  are anindependent offshoot  of  theirs called  the Dhawi Barakat, chiefAbd  el Ass 155  ibn Qasi. ($)    Their strength  is about  650 men,and while the clans quarrel  among themselves, the  whole of  theDhawi  Hasan and Dhawi  Barakat would make common causeagainst the Sherif of Mecca if need be.  At the present time, thesentiment of both tribes seems to be in favour of acquiescence inthe Sherifs rule as the  weakest form  of government obtainable,and so far  preferable  to domination by the Turks or  the Idrisi.They have refused to  contribute  men to the  Sherifs  forcesacting against Medina.    * The  numbers given in the table  are arrived &quot;at  by taking  themean between  the number?  as given by Mohammed  Hujeir, and thosearrived at from the fact that the Beni Mehidi annually circumcise 35 to 40youths of 18 years of age.  Assuming tbe life of a Bedouin to be 43 years,this  gives  1,200  mates  of that tribe  between 15 and  60 years of age.Hujeir&apos;s estimate  was 25 per cent less.    t Sheikh Mohammed Hasan Ibn el Ud, mentioned in the Handbook ofAsir as Sheikh  of the Dhawi  Barakat, is an  unimportant pirate belongingto tbe Kliumjiin.    J Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Badish of  the Dhawi Ayaf petitioned theKing of Hejaz. saving the Survey was building barracks.    5 Sheikh Abd el Aziz ibn Qasi of the Dhawi Barakat took an active part in destroying marks.
     &quot;The total of the tAvo clans thus  amounts to perhaps 4,000men, including slaves, of whom the Dhawi Barakat possess many.The present price of a male slave is about 200 mejidies.   Besidesthese, the Manadil and lluwajiha,  inhabiting the same territories and  also of Sherifial descent,  consider  themselves as  independantclans.    Sub-Sections.

But sainbuks on leaving Jidda could always purchase immunity by taking onboard some  member of  the two clans  who acted as &apos; ratio;&apos; or, asthey say locally, &apos; hawi.&apos;   This &apos; rafiq &apos;  or  &apos; ltawi&apos; would  leavethe dhow he protected at Dauqa or Qiuifuda. and return  perhapswith a north-bound craft.     &quot;Blood feuds  are  seldom  compounded  by a tine, and if aman of Sherifial descent is killed by  one  of another tribe, fourlives are supposed to be exacted for bis.  Some of my informant&apos;relations pirated a craft belonging to Sheikh  Arif ibn Arifan ofQadhima. murdered his three companions, wounded him severelyand  threw him into the sea.  He offered a stout resistance, killedone  of the aggressors, and finally escaped to  the Turkish garrison at Lith,  off which  place his vessel had been lying.   But as be had committed the  sin of killing  a Sherif, his blood or  that ofhis family is still sought by  Dhawi Hasan,  arid my informant,Mohammed Hujeir of the Beni Mehidi, announced his  intentionof killing him if ever he obtained  the  opportunity.   MohammedHujeir gained some local notoriety by killing one of the DhawiBarakat in the market at Lith some time ago.   The above  storyis corroborated in every detail by  Sheikh  Mohammed Arif, from whom  1 just heard it, and  who showed me the scars of thewounds received in  the combat.     &quot; The laws  of  Dhawi Hasan  resemble those  of  other  Arabtribes, but the penalties imposed are slighter than those prescribed by custom in Sinai or Moab.&quot;                          Intelligence.     Following on reports published in our  Nos. 53 and 54, pp.271, 278, information has now come, via  Tor, from a  reliableArab who left  Akaba  on June 11.   At that date the place hadbeen,  reoccupied, he stated, by a mixed force of some fifty Turkand  Syrian regulars and  some three hundred  Arab irregulars.The  agent  testified further  to  having  seen  a  number  of&quot; foreigners,&quot; occupying twenty-eight tents, and wearing peakedcaps.   If:  this news  is  correct, it  may possibly be explained as
referring&apos;  to a naval detachment.   We were informed that one,officered by Germans,  was sent southwards in  April last fromGalilee.     According  to unconfirmed information received by theFrench Military  Mission  at Jiddah,  but of  uncertain  value,Sherif  Zeid has driven in a certain number of  enemy outpostsof unknown strength near  Medina.  Except  Awali,  tbe  gardenoasis  some  two miles  east of the  city, the names of the placesthus  reported cleared are  not known to us ; but  &quot; Ivhakhe&quot; issaid to be  two  hours  distant, probably to  east.   The  others,.&quot; Shehat &quot;  (or &quot; Hillah Shehat &quot;) and &quot; Sola,&quot; remain  unplaced.The report says that  the Beni Ali of Awali  made common  causewith  Zeid&apos;s forces, but tbe Turks were able to get their gunsaway..  It  will  be remembered, that these  tribesmen, who areHarb Shiahs,  were cruelly  treated  last  August by the Medinagarrison on its first sortie after the outbreak of tbe Revolt.     Zeid has  reported the  arrival of a deputation of  sheikhs andsheikhs&apos; sons  who  (so far as  we  can identify their names)brought the adhesion of constituents of the  Aslara Sbaminar andthe two chief  Anazeh tribes of  the  northern  Hamad, the  Sibaaand the Fedaan.   As, however,  some of  the  tribal and personalnames seem to  have suffered  in  transliteration (and probably also in typing),  we await confirmation of news, which, if correct,might have some bearing on future plans.     Grazing  is  unusually scarce  in  the  Hejaz this summer,thanks  to drought and locusts, and this scarcity complicates alloperations, fodder having to be  carried where usually transportanimals can Jive off  tbe country.   There  is also  everywhere ashortage of  camels, and  to  this more than anything else has been due tbe long delay of  Feisafs  offensive  against  the  el-Alasection  of  the railway.  There is now, however, good prospectof  his getting to work immediately in combination  with  hisbrother Abdullah, who will operate against Hadiyah and neigli-bourhood.   The  first fortnight of  July should show us how far this offensive is likely to succeed in  its  immediate  and ultimateobjects.     A  further report  from Sherif Zeid about the fight between his forces and the Rashidite party, mentioned on p. 285  above,states  that  the  enemy  party was  composed mainly of Turkishregulars  under Hamid  Bey ;  the latter  escaped, but all his menwere  either killed or captured.   The report puts  the  enemyfigures  at  26 killed  and  250 prisoners ; and Sherif Feisal saysthere  is no doubt that the Emir Saud  Ibn Rashid  himself was present, but got away.  Accompanying the  soldiers  were  certainQasim iand  Kuweit  merchants  (it  is alleged), and measures arebeing taken to  ascertain  their  names,  with a view  to  reportingthem  to our  Political  Officers on the Mesopotamia.!! side.   Theamount of  sheep  and other live stock taken seems to have beenvery large.
                      MESOPOTAMIA.              Museiylb,  Kerbela, Nejef and Hillah.      Reports  by Captain H. W.  Young on his visit of inspection, in the early part of April,  to  the  Euphratean  country  between .Vfuseiyib and Hillah  have  reached  us from  Baghdad.  Most of their contents refer to matters too exclusively Mesopotamia!! and local to be suitable for our  Bulletin ;  but in parts they touch on the  desert, its political  condition,  temper, and  relation to the&quot;Euphratean towns.   We make certain notes and extracts.      Tbe Miiseiyib  district  is in danger of serious loss by the state into which the Hindieh Barrage has  fallen.  It seems to have been neglected and ill-used for some time ; regulator sashes have been broken  and only some  have been repaired;  machinery has been looted ;  the carriage road from Museiyib is hardly passable, and  tbe  river lias  begun  to  scour pot-holes.  The  town of Museiyib itself is reported to be  in a disturbed state, guarded day and.  night, loophpled and armed.   Stray shots are fired at all hours during the early part of the night.  The road to Baghdad, passable  for  light cars, was, at the  time  of  Captain  Young&apos;s visit, none too safe, and the same was true of the  Kerbela road. The boat bridge was found broken.      Kerbela  town  was  much  damaged in  the street fighting, but   the  Holy  Shrines  have  hardly been  touched.   The spirit shown to us in the  town was good, the  leading  ulema proving quite amenable ; but news of our movements and actions north of Baghdad was very  scanty and inaccurate.  At that time the Turks were still  holding Diwanieh,  and,  under the circumstances, it is satisfactory that Captain Young  should have been so  well received.      Nejef&apos;  showed   more   enthusiasm  than  Kerbela,  but  its leading  seyyid $  were  anxious  not to  commit  themselves too deeply.   Here, more  than  at Kerbela,,   there is  difficulty  with the  desert tribes, and  Sheikh Umran of Hindieh was got hold of and  talked to.  From the tribes&apos; point of view, the completion of the  Sari  bund near  Fellujah and the  completion of the escape above the barrage  are  pressing questions.   Uinran  was  very proud of  his  arrangements for keeping the routes open, and also of havhig locked up and taken charge of the Turkish barracks at Hindieh.    He  evidently  aims  at  being recognised  by  us as administrator of his home territory.  The town  sheikhs and the ulema seemed to be on good terms,  and Captain  Young thought, that, if   these  sheikhs, the  Eillidar   and  the  head  of  the Municipality could be officially installed  as a  town  council  with a  president elected under  our auspices, the town would govern itself  satisfactorily  till   the  end of  the  war,  with  occasional inspection by a representative of the  British military authorities.      -The same applies to  Kerbela.   Both  towns  are  quite capable of defending  themselves against the only enemies  who
are at all likely to attack them, namely, the Beni Hassan on theone side and Ibn Rashid on the other.   All that they require  isofficial  recognition of their own institutions and an occasionalvisit of inspection.   I was asked by Seyyid  Mehdi to representthat the  Shammar  will  soon be moving  down  to  the neigh-bourhood  of Nejef and Shenafieh.   The  townspeople are  quitecapable of refusing masabilah to the Shammar, if directed  to doso ; but they point out that the blockading of the towns  alonewill not  be  enough.  The  Ghazalat  tribe will always keep theShammar.supplied with rice and dates from their own lands, andnothing short of force will prevent them.&quot;              *     At Hillah,  which  was  Capt.   Young&apos;s  last  stage,  &quot;thetown-versus-tribes feeling is exceedingly strong.  The townsmendo  not hesitate  to  accuse  the tribesmen of  every kind of law-lessness and exaction.    The towns on the waterways  are almostin a state  of  siege.  Here in Hillah  three  watchmen are postedon  tbe minaret  of  the  mosque  and fire  whenever  they  see  ahorseman   beyond   the  date  groves.    This is  not  the  onlyprecaution taken.  Both here ancl at. Museiyib tbe ends of tbestreets  facing the desert are bricked up  and  loop-holed.  Thereis some reason for the tpwnsinen&apos;s attitude.   Extortionate  tisiardues  are  taken  from  travellers  under cover of the pretence  of keeping the roads open.   Twenty bellums laden with grain havecollected  here, the nakhudas being afraid to take them  on  toMuseiyib.   A petition has just this  moment been brought to me.by a  traveller   who  was  waylaid  and  robbed to-day  by theKhafaja, his companion having actually been  abducted by them.lint the townsman makes the most of his legitimate grievances.I have been assured  many times that the  Beni  Hassan  intendedto  sack Nejef and  Kerbela.   Seyyid  Mehdi,  the Nawab, AfdhalKhan, Seyyid Hadi, and  various others all claim  to have beenthe saviours  of  the  holy  shrines.  As a, matter of fact, the roadsin  Beni Hassan, territory  appear to be safer than anywhere  else.&quot;     Capt. Young  had a most enthusiastic reception at Hillah,but he  found the place in a very unsatisfactory state.     &quot; A  quarter of  the  town is in  ruins.  The  narrow  streetsare choked with debris and refuse.   The Turks, the tribes, andthe townspeople themselves seem to have vied with each other inindiscriminate looting  and  destruction.    The  nine makhtars,each  of whom  is trying  to  make  himself into a  Sheikh, havetaken no  steps to restore order.   The bridge, which  consists  of only  eight shakkturahs, has  not been put together, though the materials are all to hand.  Shots arc fired at  all hours of the day and  night.  A black  slave  named  Zanga is  allowed  to terrorisetravellers  ancl assault  women  from a fort not two miles outsidethe town on the Hindi eh road, and all  the 1,50,0 armed men ofthe town are unable to stop him.  For a fortnight or more boththe Baghdad and Hindieh  roads  have  been closed to all whoprefer not to be i-obbed  en route.  The flow  of grain from Afejand  Daghara  has been  seriously  interfered with.   No one will
drive sheep  into Baghdad.   In fact, the tribes near the town arerevelling  in  the absence of  constituted authority and  makingwhat they can while they can.&quot;                   *****     &quot; I drove to Babylon and inspected the headquarters of  theGerman archaeologists.   So  far as I  can see,  everything is un-touched, except some 200 rifles and  ammunition which  have ofcourse  been taken.   Tbe caretaker, Habib Ibn Alawi, looks a greatrascal,  but he has apparently confined himself to biking what hecould  immediately  dispose  of,  and  has  guarded  the  actualantiquities and  the personal,  property of  his  late  employerssurprisingly  well.   I put him in charge of the house and of theexcavations and promised that if no further harm  was done hewould not be forgotten.&quot;     Captain  Young sums up his impressions as follows :      &quot; The townsmen, except in Kerbela and ISIejef, which  havenever depended much on Government  assistance for  their  pro-tection, are eagerly  looking forward  to tbe restoration of  order.The tribes have had a taste of independence, and the longer theyare left to enjoy it  the more difficult will it be  to  control  themlater.  At the same time they quite  realize that they are incapable of developing the country, even  to  the extent that they  them-selves would  like to see.  As the Arab proverb puts it,  &apos; theirbrain is in their eyes.&apos;   Let them  but see that a good Governmentwill really benefit them and they  will accept the discipline andtribute without which no good Government  can  exist.   SeyyidMohammed Ali  Kasvini  was very  eloquent  on the subject ofrevenue collection.   &apos; Take something,&apos;  he said, &apos; if  it is only one-tenth of your due.   But take it at once.&apos;   With all respect tohis superior experience  of the local, population, I would suggestthat this  would  be beginning at the  wrong end.    We should give, not take,  to start with.  And the  sooner we give, tbe better.Bridges, telegraph lines, and roads  can be restored immediatelyat trifling cost.  We must at  least  show that our rule  confersequal benefits  with that  to which they have been accustomed,before  we attempt to exact what our predecessors failed to win the respect ancl  willing  submission of a subject people.&quot;
END                          NOTES.Abyssinia.     A report from the Commissioner of British Somaliland statesthat Kedani (p. 258), the Abyssinian outlaw and emissary of LijYasu,  is extending his  influence in  the  Ogaden  country  ofwhich  he probably  aspires  to  become Governor.   He appearsto  be  preparing  the  ground  in anticipation  of  Lij  Yasu&apos; return,  and  may  become a serious  danger-, if  he succeeds in establishing any cohesion among the Ogaden,  who are in the habit of making raids  into  our  Protectorate.  If  the  situationdoes not improve,  it  may become necessary  for the  british authorities to withdraw restrictions  upon counter-raiding acrosstbe border.  The Abyssinian Government, however, has for sometime contemplated the despatch  of a, punitive expedition againstthe Ogaden, and such an expedition, if successful, would probablysecure  the removal of  Keclani.   Meanwhile  the  Ogaden  chiefshave been deterred by  him  from  coming in  to treat with uspeaceably for the  return, of looted  stock.    The District Com-missioner,  Hargeisa, wrote  on  May  23 :  &quot;1  feel  sure  that what amounted to a flat refusal  by the Ogaden  to come in and see me was directly due to Kedani&apos;s influence with them.  I have it on good authority that he  told them on no account to negotiate with the British Government, because  Lij Yasu was coming backvery soon with increased power  and  would assuredly punish anytribe who disobeyed the orders of his right-hand  man.&quot;     Under date June 6, our Minister at  Adis  Abeba reportedthat the  plateau  of Magdala,  where Lij   Yasu  is,  had  beensurrounded by the troops of  Fit. Hapta Giorgis,  Ras Kassa andRas Abata : but, as the rains had already begun, a definite issuecould hardly be looked  for  this  year.   The Government troops will not be able  long  to keep  the  held,  or  even stay in theneighbourhood  of  Magdala ;  and the chance of Lij Yasu eithersurrendering  or  bolting is small.   He will more probably holdout and defy his assailants.   Meanwhile,  though, during the sixmonths of  the rains, the  Government^ position  is not likely toget much worse, it will not get  any better, if Lij Yasu remains at large.   Ras Taffari cannot cope with  the situation  and  daresneither  to lay  hands on dangerous  disaffected  chiefs, nor to initiate any of the  reforms which lie knows  to be necessary.   Heis keeping Ras Seyyum of Tigre and Ras Hailu of Gojjam inhonourable detention at Aclis Abeba for the summer, and, whenlet go, these  chiefs are likely  to carry away a wholehearted con-tempt for his authority.
