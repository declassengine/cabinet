SECRET.114APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ANNEXED EASTERN REPORT,  No VIII.                                     RUSSIA..     IN  the report will he found a chronological account of the events which took placein Petrograd  between the 9th/March  when the Empire  was  in  existence and  the20th March when the  ex-Emperor was arrested.     It is impossible to gauge either the human motives, the psychological forces, or thefundamental factors which have  contributed  to produce these events.   It is probably not an overstatement to say that the catastrophe which has befallen the Prussian Empireis a more prodigious historical event than  the fall of the old  regime in France.  Theignorance of the Prussian multitudes, the lack of administrative experience characteristicof most Prussian politicians, the occult nature of the secret forces working on the side ofrevolution  and reaction, and the effect of the disappearance of the  traditional bond ofpaternal discipline, which ran from the Emperor to the lowest grade of the army, areelements which defy scrutiny.     From  the point of view of the prosecution of the war, there are Wo outstanding points :      1. The effect  of  the  revolution on the  discipline  of the Russian army,  on  the           authority of its high command, and on the military appointments made by           the Government.     2. The effect of the revolution on Germany.     If the result  of  the  Russian revolution be  to provoke  a  serious  anti-dynasticmovement  in  Germany, then the first point becomes  of small importance ; if, on  theother hand, the rulers  of Germany retain their hold unimpaired, then the  question ofthe maintenance  of  the Russian army in a state of obedience and mobility outbalancesall other considerations.     In regard to M. Kerenskfs statement that &quot; M. Miliukoff was  not  to be believedwhen he said Russia wanted Constantinople,&quot; it must be remembered that no revolutioncan  alter  geographical  facts.    In  this  instance the  geographical  facts are  that russia is ice-bound on  the north and desert-bound on the south, so that  the  Straitsform the only  available outlet for the Autocracy,  Empire,  Monarchy, Commonwealth,Republic, Commune, Communal Federation, or the Slav unit  in  the United States ofEurope,  or whatever government may be produced by the ferment at present working in Russia.     In regard to the  whole movement in Prussia, it is worth mentioning that presstelegrams from Russia will repay careful study as, although many are probably  devoidof serious foundation,  they show  the tendency of thought of the  people who influencethose who  comnose the communications.                                    RUMANIA.     There is nothing to add to the information in  the  report.       [898-35]
                                     TURKEY.    Although there is nothing forthcoming from Turkey in this report, it is intresting to note that there are rumours of a stormy sitting in the  Turkish Chamber when thefall of Baghdad was announced.   If this is true, it may be safely assumed that it  wasTala&apos;at&apos;&quot;s first&apos; move against Enver.&apos;  The Russian Revolution offers the Young Turksconsiderable opportunity in the organisation  of the  Moslem  vote in Russia on pan-Turanian lines.

RUSSIA                                   The Revolution.     The following is a summary of the chief events  in the  Russian revolution as givenin the telegrams from the British Embassy  in  Petrograd, with  some additions fromReuter&apos;s telegrams.  The numbers of the telegrams are given in brackets :-     The disturbances in Petrograd began by strikes  caused  by a scarcity of bread.   OnFriday, 9th March, the Prime  Minister summoned  an  extraordinary meeting to  dealwith  the food question,  at which were  present,   in addition to the Ministers, thePresident of the  Duma, the President of the Council  of  the Empire,, the  Mayor  of petrogard,  and  the   Presidents  of  the   Petrograd  Provincial  Zemstvos.   It  was unanimously decided that the whole question of supplying Petrograd should be handedover to the municipal authorities [No.  289].  They, however, refused to take control, on       [898-35]                                                             B
 the ground that it could only be worked by committees representative  of all  classes [No. 301].  Notices were posted all over the town to the effect that there was plenty of flour of all sorts, and  that  the  supply had  not  only been  maintained but increased [No. 289].  As a matter of fact,  on the 12th March there was a twelve days&apos;  supply in the town [No. 301].   People, who had nothing to do obtained more than their share ; others who could not  afford to wait for hours at the shops had to go without.   Some bikers  found  it  more  profitable to  sell their share  of  the flour than go  to  the expense of baking with fuel at five times its normal  price ; for coal, too, was scarce, for instead of the  12,000,000 poods [1 pood - 36 English pounds] required  for Petrograd for the month of March, only  2,300,000 had been allotted, and this was only sufficient for the  Putiloff, Obukhov, and Isorsk works [No. 301].     On this same day, Friday, 9th -March, tramways were wrecked  and shops sacked: the Minister for Foreign Affairs affirmed that no lives were lost, but from other sources the  Embassy learnt that some persons had been killed [No. 289].     Saturday,  10th March:  Trams ceased running.  There were large crowds  in  the streets, with  Cossacks and police in strength.   A great number of workmen from  the suburbs marched on the town forcing the  men in factories on their way  to stop work [No. 289].  On this day a few policemen and soldiers were killed or wounded.     Sunday, 11th March : There  was considerable firing on the Nevski Prospect, and the  casualties were estimated to be at least 200 [No. 301].   A later  estimate puts  the casualties on Saturday and Sunday at 300 [No. 332]   The crowds sang revolutionary songs and occasionally waved red  flags, but the general opinion was that they had done nothing  to merit  such  punishment.   By this time  the movement  had become anti- Government ; but it was not directed against the war, in fact there appeared to be general dissatisfaction among the workmen at the slackness with which the Government was  waging war [No.  301].     Monday, 12th March: The Preobrajensky  regiment  mutinied  on being made to fire on the mob.   Other regiments were  sent to coerce;  they, however, joined hands, and  by  nightfall  practically the  entire  Petrograd  garrison  had seceded [No.  3:12]. There  was hardly any  opposition to  the  mutinous ^troops;  the  arsenal was  taken and  arms distributed to the public.   Prisoners, political and criminal, were released [No. 310].  M. Rodzianko sent  telegrams  to the Emperor  and  the commanders of armies explaining the  situation, begging that the firing on the people should be stopped,and  praying that for the sake of the dynasty a Government of public  confidence shouldbe appointed.  Only General  Brusiloff replied.  The President of the Duma sent a secondtelegram to the Emperor, saying that a,ny delay would  be fatal; to this no reply wasreceived.  The  Duma appointed an Executive Committee of twelve members, to  securecontrol of the movement to restore order, to  declare the Government  abolished, and tokeep the machine going.   This committee told the soldiers definitely, &quot; If you are  forwar, we are  with you&quot; [No. 310].    The  Council  of  Ministers  telegraphed  to  theEmperor advising him  to appoint a President of the Council with dictatorial powers,and  to  give him a free  hand to  choose his colleagues [unnumbered telegram, sent on 13th March].    The Emperor  appointed General Ivanoff dictator [No. 311], but  he  didnot go to Petrograd [No. 321.].  At this time the insurgents were  masters of  nearlythe whole of the town, and occupied both the fortress and  the &quot;Winter Palace [No. 311],     Wednesday, 14th  March :  The Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted that  therevolution  was  an  accomplished  fact, and that the Government had no troops withwhich  to suppress  it.  The  EmperoPs  train,  taking him from his headquarters to Tsarskoe Selo, was stopped half-way at  Bologoe and not allowed  to proceed  further. The Duma was sending a delegation with its conditions, which were :  (1) Abdication in favour of his son ;  (2) The appointment of his brother, the Grand  Duke Michael, as Regent; and (3) Responsible coalition Government, comprising two  labour members, under the presidency  of Prince Lvoff, with M. Miliukoff as Minister for Foreign  Affairs [No. 314].   Rodzianko&apos;s draft manifesto was signed  by the  Grand  Duke Michael and two  other Grand Dukes to  show that  in  their opinion  the  Emperor ought to  sign it [No. 316].  Thousands of troops had come into the town and joined the insurgents, and a certain number of officers had joined  them.  The  police were firing with  machine- guns from the roofs of houses [No.  314].     Thursday,   15th   March:   On  or before this day the official  organ  of  the Executive Committee published a manifesto, addressed to  all  commanders of the army and  navy, stating that the Executive Committee had assumed the functions of govern- ment; all members of the old  Government having been put aside [No. 321j.  The Emperor abdicated in favour of the Grand Duke Michael.  The  manifesto  which  lie published was telegraphed by Reuter as follows : 
         &quot; By the grace  of  God, we, Nicholas II, Emperor of all the Bussias, Tsar of    Poland, Grand Duke of Finland, &amp;c, to all our faithful subjects be it known.         &quot; In the days of the  great  struggle  against a foreign enemy, who has been    endeavouring for three years to  enslave our country, it pleased God to send Russia    a further painful trial.         &quot; Internal troubles threatened to have  a  fatal effect on the further progress    of this obstinate war.   The destinies of Bussia, the honour of her heroic army, the    happiness of the people, and the whole  future of our beloved fatherland demand    that the war should  be  conducted at all costs to a victorious end.         &quot; The cruel enemy is  making  his last efforts, and the  moment is near when    our valiant army, in concert  with Our glorious allies, will finally overthrow the    enemy.         &quot; In  these decisive days in the life of Russia  we have thought that we owed    to our people the  close  union and organisation of all  its forces for the realisation    of rapid victory, for  which reason,  in agreement with the  imperial Duma, we  have    recognised that it  is  for the good of the country  that we should abdicate the crown    of the Russian state and lay down the supreme power.         V Not wishing  to  separate ourself from our  beloved son, we  bequeath our    heritage to our brother, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch, with our blessing    for the future of the throne of the Russian state.         &quot; We bequeath  it to our brother to  govern in full union  with the  national    representatives sitting in the legislative institutions, and to take his inviolable oath    to them in the name of our well-beloved fatherland.         &quot; We call upon nil faithful sons of the fatherland to fulfil their sacred  and    patriotic duty in obeying the Tsar at the  painful moment of national trials, and to    aid him, together  with  the representatives of the  nation, to conduct the Russian    state in the way of prosperity and glory.   May  God help Russia.&quot;    A proclamation announcing the  abdication was  posted in Petrograd, and soldiersthen began  to tear down the  imperial eagles  The Grand  Duke Michael refused  toaccept the succession  [No. 333].   The members  of  the new  Government had a longconference with him on Friday the 16th March, the result being a manifesto in whichthe Grand Duke, while expressing his  readiness to place his services at the disposal ofthe new Government, declared that he  would  not accept  the throne unless called to it by  the voice  of  the people  expressed in  a constituent assembly.  Sir G. Buchanangathered  that a directorate would be appointed for the duration of the war [No. 339].    On Friday, the 16th March, Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 502] to Sir G. Buchananauthorising him to acknowdedge the  new  Ministry  as a de  facto Government if andwhen he thought this to  be expedient, subject to the  proviso  that the French Ambas-ambassador agreed with him.   Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 506 \ Mr. Balfoursaid that doubtless Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s aciion in this  matter  would  largely depend onthe attitude of the new Government  towards the war ; all his influence should be throwninto the scale against any administration which was not resolved to  fight to a finish.[On the 19th he telegraphed  again [No.  517], saying that as the political crisis in france might prevent the French Ambassador from receiving instructions which would enablethem to act together at some critical moment, Sir G.  Buchanan  was authorised to  act alone, when he thought isolated action better than no action at all.]    On the  17th March Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed  [No.  342],  saying  that  theFrench Ambassador had  not received  instructions to recognise  the new Governmentand did not wish  him to act independently.  He also said that M. Miliukoff had that daytaken over the direction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and had invited him  andhis French and Italian colleagues to  call.  M  Miliukoff said that:      (1.)  The new Government had had enormous difficulties to surmount and had been           obliged to take account of the views of the extreme labour party, who had           now accepted its  programme and  was, he hoped, gradually coming round           to the  necessity of maintaining  discipline  in  the  army &quot;and of resuming           work.    (2.) The attitude of the Baltic fleet had caused the Government grave anxity, but           the latest news received was more  reassuring.    (3.)  It was impossible to give the  new Government  a precise denomination :  the           best term would be &quot; Provisional Government  invested with full Powers.&quot;           The present Duma was not in keeping with  the present  situation ; it could           not overthrow   the Government  and  the  Government  would   not   be           responsible to it.
(4.) The Finnish Constitution would be restored.(5.) A special tribunal would be appointed to try those partisans of the old regime       who had  been  arrested; there  would be a general  amnesty  for  all other       political and religious offences.(6.) The elections for  the General Assembly would take place shortly.   In reply to       a suggestion of the difficulty of this being done  in  war time, he said that       the Government had to count  with those who feared a counter-revolution,       and who  wished to have the question settled at once ; but when  the allied       Governments had recognised  the new Russian Government, he would tell       his colleagues that those Governments, while expressing their full confidence       in the Governments determination to fight  out the war to a finish, were       filled with alarm at the idea of those elections.    M. Miliukoff *dso gave them to understand that, in spite of statements in the press,the Grand Duke Nicholas would not assume command of the army.  He also said thatthe position of the Emperor was  precarious and, though his life  was not in danger, heshould like to see him leave the country as soon as possible.    On  the 18th March Sir G. Buchanan said that if  only the  present Governmentcould get the situation well in hand, the  best solution would be that it  should continueto act as a provisional Government for so long as the war lasted.   When once normalconditions had been restored, there was every reason to believe that it would prove itselfan energetic and efficient War Cabinet.   It  would sweep away all the abuses of theold regime and prepare the ground for a permanent constitutional Government, eitherrepublican or monarchical, after the war.    The manifesto of the new Government, as telegraphed by Reuter, was as follows:           &quot; Citizens,  the Provisional  Executive of the Duma, with the aid and support    of the  garrison of the capital  and its inhabitants, has now  triumphed over the    noxious forces of the old regime in such a measure as to enable it to proceed to the    more stable organisation of the executive power.   With this object the Provisional    Committee has appointed as Ministers of the first National Cabinet  men whose    past political and public activity assures them the confidence of the country.          &quot; The new Cabinet  will adopt the following  principles  as the bases of  its    policy : -       &quot; 1.  An immediate  general  amnesty for  all  political and  religious offences,              including terrorist acts, military revolts, and agrarian crimes.       &quot; 2. Freedom of speech, of the press, of association and labour organisation, and              the freedom to strike, with  an extension of these liberties to officials and              troops in so far as military and technical conditions permit.       &quot; 3. The abolition of al] social, religious, and national restrictions.       &quot; 4. Immediate preparations for the summoning of  a  constituent  assembly,              which, with univers tl  suffrage as a basis, shall establish the governmental              regime and the constitution  of the country.       &quot;    The substitution for the police of a national militia, with elective heads and              subject to the self-government bodies.       &quot; 6. Communal elections to be carried out on the basis of universal suffrage.       &quot; 7. The troops that have taken part in the revolutionary movement shall not              be dParmed, but they are not to leave Petrograd.       &quot;8. While severe  military discipline  must  be  maintained  on active service, all              restrictions  upon soldiers  in the enjoyment of social  -rights  granted to              other citizens are to be abolished.          &quot; The Provisional Government wishes to add that it has no  intention of taking    advantage of the existence of war conditions  to delay the realisation of the above-    mentioned measures of reform.&quot;     On the 18th March Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed that a member of the Governmenthad expressed some  apprehension lest the extreme party should insist on the arrest ofthe Emperor, and suggested that it would be well if he were authorised to state  thatany violence offered to the person of the Emperor wrould alienate British sympathy.Mr. Balfour answering this said that general sympathy  had been won by the peaceabiemanner in  which the revolution  had so far been carried out.  Violence done  to theEmperor or his  family  would have  a most deplorable effect  and would deeply shockEnglish public opinion.  Sir G.  Buchanan  might speak  in this  sense to the Provisional
      On the 18 th March he telegraphed [No. 346] that he and  his colleagues  had had another interview with M. MiliukorF, who said that a proclamation which the  Govern- meiit was about to issue would give assurances as to the continuation of the war, though he was unable to promise  that  the words &quot; guerre a  outratice &quot; would  be  used.   As regarded the discipline of the army, the Government had to reckon with the extremists, and  therefore  to proceed  cautiously.   Any drastic   steps such  as  the  arrest of propagandists among  the troops  might  cause disorders.  Another telegram [No. 354] on  the  same  day  reported a  conversation  between  the  military  attache  and M. Kerenski, the  Minister  of Justice, who is  the only Socialist in the Government. M. Kerenski said  that:       1. The council  of  workmen  and  soldiers&apos; deputies  was  losing ground,  and he            1 hought that the men  would be back  at  drill  within  a week,  whilst the            factories were to start work that day.      2. In regard  to the Emperor going, he should like to know whether the  British            Government would undertake to discountenance any attempt at a counter-            revolution from  England.      3.  He had placed representatives of the regiments at Tsarskoe Selo on their honour            that no attempt should be made on the Empress.      4.  The Grind Duke  Nicholas would not  be retained as commander-in-chief, and            probably  the Grand  Dukes  Serge  and  Alexander would  also  retire  on            account  of the  feelings against the  family.    As  to the  Grand Duke            Nicholas, the soldiers were against  his retention of the command.      5.  Miliukoff  was  without tact in regard to  foreign policy : he  was  not to be            believed when he said  that  Russia  wanted Constantinople.   He  himself            only wanted internationalisation of the Straits.     6.  As to Poland, Finland, and Armenia, he wanted them to have self-government ;            Armenia as a separate entity from the Caucasus.     7.  The  Provisional  Government  had been  acknowledged  by the Senate  on  the            previous day.     On the 19th March Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 355] that M. Miliukoff had expressed himself  as more satisfied with  the  situation, though he admitted that therewas considerable  divergence  among the troops  in  regard to the change of  regime.Speaking of Finland, he said that a written constitution would have to be drafted, butthat  no  decision could be taken until the Constituent Assembly had met.   In  regardto Poland,  he peisonally was against either  independence or a  separate  army :  headvocated a large measure of autonomy and a /territorial  army which would form  an integral part of the Russian army.   According to accounts which had reached  Sir  G.Buchanan,  the extreme  party seemed  to be losing ground, and he  trusted that  theProvisional Government would soon have the situation in hand;  it apparently intended,he said, to  govern the country and to conduct the war without any reference  to  theDuma.  M. Chelnokoff took an optimistic view  of the  situation;  there-was now,  hesaid,  complete  order  in Moscow,  and  only  six  lives  had  been  lost  there.   He(M. Chelnokoff) believed that the final solution  would be the election of a constitutionalEmperor,  and  that  the  Grand  Duke Michael would  be  the most likely candidate;His Imperial Highness, he said, had won considerable popularity since the publicationof his manifesto.    Also, on the  19th, Sir G. Buchanan  telegraphed [No. 351] that  M. Miliukoff had informed  him that the Emperor had requested the Government to allow him to go toTsarskoe  Selo  and to remain there  till his  children  had recovered  from measles.M. Miliukoff had  given  Sir - G. Buchanan to understand that this would be allowed,and had asked whether he knew of  any arrangements being made for the Emperor togo to  England.    On the 20th  March the military attache&quot;,  Colonel Knox,  telegraphed throughSir G. Buchanan [No. 360] that he and Major Thornhill  had that morning visited theSemenovski depot battalion,  which  was nearly 8,000 strong ;  the instructional  company,600 strong, appeared to  be  in perfect order.  They then  met the so-called  battalionCommittee, which chiefly consists of the best type of non-commissioned officers, elected by the  rank  and file of the battalion ;  the members  of the committee attend thecouncil of working-men and  soldier deputies.   Colonel Knox and Major  Thornhill gave them  maps of the Somme area and photographs of the Western front as presents from our army.    They were asked many questions as to discipline in the British service, andthey hoped that they had been able  to strengthen the position of the officers  by teliing      [898-35]                          &quot;        &quot;                     C
the committee how discipline was maintained in the army of free England.   They  all agreed that the German barbarians must be  defeated.  The  171st  depbt regiment,temporarily in the same barracks, was in a less satisfactory  state ;  the commanding officer had been obliged to send away seven officers to whom the regimental committeeobjected.   These committees were not to be started in units at the front.     On the same day Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 361] in regard to a manifestowhich the Government had issued ;  a summary of which had been telegraphed abroad,and in it the following passage occurred :          &quot; The Government believes  that the  highly patriotic spirit displayed by the     people  in  their struggle  ,.uth the old autocracy will also inspire our soldiers on     (? field) of battle.  The Government,  on its part, will exert all its strength towards     supplying  our army with all that is  necessary for the prosecution of the  war to a     victorious finish.&quot;     Sir G.  Buchanan  said that the  French Ambassador handed to  the Minister  forForeign  Affairs an  eloquent appeal  from  French  to  Russian workmen, and  thencontrasted its language with that of the above passage.   No mention, he said, had beenmade in  it;  of  Germany  or of the aims of the Allies,  and  in a passionate tirade hedeclared that it was &quot;abominable&quot; and that he was &quot; indigne.&quot;   He added that he wasspeaking officially and had carefully weighed bis words.     The Minister  for Foreign Affairs replied  that he did not understand the cause ofhis indignation ; that the French style of writing was quite different from the Russian;that the manifesto was addressed to the people, and, as it had an internal character, it only touched  lightly on the war, of which  the Government  had on other  occasionsannounced the vigorous  prosecution.   A  lengthy altercation followed, in which theFrench Ambassador spoke with great heat,  whilst the Minister for  Foreign Affairsremained quite calm.     Sir G. Buchanan himself said that he should  like to be able to inform his Govern-ment of the exact meaning of the words &quot; a victorious finish &quot; in the event of a  question being addressed to it  in the House  of Commons.  The Minister for  Foreign Affairsreplied that he had always protested against Mr. Wilsons  expression of a &quot; peace without victory,&quot;  and  that bis idea  of a victorious peace  was based on  conditionsembodied in reply  of the Allies to Mr. Wilson&apos;s peace proposals.  Sir G. Buchanan then asked whether these views represented those of the Government as a whole, and theForeign Minister  replied in  the affirmative.   He subsequently promised the french ambassador that  he would take tire first  opportunity of making a stronger  declaration on the subject of the war.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 21st March [No. 364] that a statement havingappeared  in the Press tnat  the Emperor bad been arrested, he- had questioned theMinister  of Foreign Affairs,  and had been  informed   that  Flis Majesty  had  been deprived of his liberty, and would be taken to Tsarskoe Zelo under  an escort.  TheMinister  had asked him whether any arrangements were being made  for His Majesty to stay in  England;  on receiving a negative  reply, he went on  to  say that he was  most anxious that the Emperor should leave Russia, aud that he should be grateful if  anasylum in England were  at once offered ; the offer being accompanied  by an assurance that His  Majesty  would not  leave England during  the war.   A telegram from theForeign Office  to  Sir G. Buchanan [No. 534] crossed this.  Mr. Balfour said  that  heshould of course be glad to know that the Emperor had left Russia, but no invitationhad been sent to him to come  to England ; and it seemed to be  very doubtful whether such a course would be desirable.  Mr. Balfour asked whether the Emperor had  thought of Denmark or Switzerland.   In this telegram bir G. Buchanan was reminded that heshould be careful  in his interviews with members of the Imperial family not to giveumbrage to the new Government.     The  Prime Minister  telegraphed [No.  541] to  the  Russian  Premier  on  the21st March saying that  the  peonies  of Great Britain  and of the British  Dominionsacross the  seas have learnt, with sentiments of  the most  profound satisfaction, thattheir great ally Russia now stood with the nations which based their institutions  uponresponsible government.   He believed that the revolution, whereby the Russian people have based their destinies  on the  sure foundation of freedom,  was (much as  weappreciated the loyal and steadfast co-operation which we have received from,  the lateEmperor and the armies of Russia during  the last two and a.  half years) the  greatestservice which they had yet made to the cause  for which the allied peoples had  beenfighting since August 1914.  It revealed  the  fundamental  truth that this war. was at
bottom a struggle not  only for liberty, but also  for popular government.  It showed that, through the war, the principle of liberty, the only sure safeguard of peace in  theworld, had already won  one  resounding victory.  It  was the sure promise  that  the prussian military autocracy which had  begun the  war, and which was still  the onlybarrier to peace, would itself before  long, be overthrown.   Freedom was the conditionof peace,  and  he did not doubt fhat as a result  of the establishment of a  stableConstitutional  Government  within  their borders  the  Russian  people  would   be strengthened in their resolve to prosecute this war until the last stronghold of tyrannyon the  Continent of Europe was destroyed, and the free peoples of all lands couldunite to secure for themselves and their children the blessings of fraternity and peace.                             Proposed Japanese Loan.    Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 10th  March  [No.  286]  that he had received an urgent note from the  Ministry of Foreign  Affairs informing him that the BussianGovernment had been  offered a loan for 70,000,000 yen, at 6 per cent., by a syndicateof Japanese bankers.   The loan was to be issued  at 9 7, and a commission of 2 per cent.was to be given to the syndicate, which was also  to  receive one-eighth  of the interestwhen this was paid, -and \ per  thousand  when  the  loan was  paid  off.   The RussianGovernment were  insisting on the issue  price being 97-1-; but the other terms it wasobliged to accept.   They wished, however, first to know whether the British and french governments  had any objection, and  whether  they considered that a loan on these terms would make it difficult for the Allies to obtain better ones for the proposed jointloan.                              Munitions from Japan.    Sir C. Greene  telegraphed  on  the 15th  March [No. 190] that, in pursuance of instructions, the Bussian Ambassador had  informed the Minister of Foreign Affairs thathis Government desired  that it  should be  supplied with heavy artillery, quick-firing,of up-to-date  type, and  of not less than  15-centim.  calibre; the guns to be supplied with  teams and  ammunition  caissons complete;  with  a minimum of 1,000 roundsper gun  on delivery, and 400 rounds per gun per month to  follow..  It was furtherhoped that the batteries  would be  accompanied  by the necessary personnel.   TheRussian Ambassador also said that, of the 116  guns already offered by the JapaneseGovernment,  only 16  howitzers corresponded with the  requirements of the PrussianmJitary authorities.  In  lvply, the  Minister for  Foreign Affairs said  that on the first occasion  he had done all that he could  to persuade  the  Minister  for War to meet thewishes of the Russian Government,  and had even given an undertaking not to reopen the questiou.  He feared that it would not be possible to go  any further, but he would do his best.  The  Russian request  was supported  by the English and French Ambas-sadors, but the replies given to them were not encouraging.                             The  Transport Question.    Tn  a telegram sent through  Sir G.  Buchanan [No. 307]  on the  12th March,Mr. Bury expressed the opinion that Great Britain should immediately make financial arrangements to enable Russia to place orders in America for 600 large locomotives and,000 large-capacity gondola waggons, to  be sent with  the  quickest possible deliveryvia Vladivostock.                Treatment of Enemy Hospital Ships hi the Black Sea.    Sir  G.  Buchanan telegraphed on  the 11th  March  [No.  297] that the RussianGovernment, though it could not withdraw the declarations made to the  Bulgarian and turkish  Governments in  regard  to their hospital ships in the Black Sea, had issuedinstructions that it was desirable not  to sink such ships  but to seize  them  and bring them into port.  Should this be impossible they were.to be permitted to continue  then-course, and only in extreme cases should they be  destroyed after giving the staff and wounded an opportunity of saving themselves.  The Russian  Government had addedthat an encounter between one of its men-of-war and a hospital ship appeared  to be.improbable,  as enemy shipping in the Black Sea was almost nil.
                                   RUMANIA.                                General  Situation.    On the.13th March the  military attache  at Jassy telegraphed [No. 135] that themilitary situation had not changed during the  past two months ; while the presentweather lasted no active operations were possible on  either side, as the whole country was under snow, and the roads were in a very bad state.  The economic  situation had improved  slightly.  The Russian  Government had agreed to send  daily  a quantityof food,  which  it  was estimated would suffice  for the  Rumanian  army;  the civilpopulation could just exist on the stocks of cereals  which remained if a  proper systemof rationing were introduced and applied regularly.    It was now generally recognised  by people on  the  spot  that it was impossible to evacuate the civil  population  into Russia ; and the one outstanding  question was theevacuation of the  whole or part of the Rumanian army.  The King, as head of thearmy, was naturally opposed  to its  removal from  Rumanian territory, and, in view ofthe fact that the wants of the army could be met by thirty trucks of munitions and thirty trucks  of supplies  daily, the  necessity for its evacuation  into Russia was notapparent.  He (the military attache) believed that, rather than be exiled to  a country which they disliked and distrusted, a large proportion of the personnel would desert ;the -political  consequences would  be  disastrous and, as presumably Rumanian troops would be replaced bv  Russian troops,  the economic gain would be inappreciable.    On the 15th March Mr. B dfour telegraphed  [No. 87] to Sir G.  Barclay  that theproposal to evacuate at ieast a portion  of  the Rumanian army into  Russia should besvpported by him.   The importance  of  the continued  presence of King  Ferdinand inRumania  was fully  appreciated, and Mr.  Balfour  suggested that, if possible, the six.Rumanian divisions now in the front  line should be retained  in  Moldavia,  under the direct command of the King; in no case should less  than two divisions be retainedunder his command.                              7 he Railway  Question.    On  the  6th March  Sir  G.  Buchanan telegraphed [No.  27&quot;2] that the military attache  had  been informed  that  General  Sakharoff  would  like  to have  a  Britishengineer attached to his staff for the  direction of the Rumanian railways.  On the 9thMr. Balfour informed Sir.  G. Buchanan  [Tel.  No. 454]  that, provided the admiralty could find transport, the War Office would send Mr de Candolle, the  general managerof the Buenos Ayres Great  Southern Railway, with about  six assistants.   Mr. deCandolle possessed all the necessary qualifications aud spoke  French  fluently.  On thesame day Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Barclay I No. 80] instructing him to informthe Rumanian Government  of what was being done, and to  add  that, in view of thegreat importance of adequate  means ol communication in Rumania, he felt sure  that  itwould afford Mr. de Candolle every possible support and would issue suitable instructionsto  all local   authorities.    A telegram from Sir  G. Buchanan  [No.  281], crossingMr. Balfour&apos;s to him, said that the Russian Government was grateful for the friendlyaction of this  countryr, but it  had  not proposed  to take  over the Rumanian railways.It understood that  the  practical difficulties were considerable  and  the  Rumanianopposition strong.    The  Foreign  Office telegraphed on the  21st  March  to Sir  G.  Buchanan  and toSir G.  Barclay that Mr. de  Candolle, who had  been gazetted the  temporary rank  ofbrigadier-general, had  left on the 18th instant for Petrograd and Jassy with instructionsto report himself to them on ai-rival.  He had received  detailed  instructions  regardinghis position,  which he would  communicate to them.  He had  been told  that no  replyconcerning his mission had been received from the Roumanian Government, and that therefore it was possible that his attachment to  the staff of General Sakharoff might be altered to fit in with  later instructions  ; and  he  was being warned that he was  being sent to Boumania only in an advisory capacity.                                   British Corn.    Sir  G.  Barclay   telegraphed  on  the 7th  March  [No.  126 A]  that  an   officerrepresenting the Russian Agricultural  Department  (who had previously approachedCaptain Pitts in regard to taking over  our corn) had stated that he had received orders from his chief at Odessa that the corn  was no longer required by them and should  begiven to the Rumanians.  In  reply, the Foreign Office telegraphed on the 19th March[No. 89] that Sir G. Barclay was  authorised  to use his discretion as to  the disposal ofthe grain in consultation with the military attache  and Mr. [sfc] Pitts.
                                 THE  SENUSSI.                          Idrisi  El Seno and the Italians.     Colonel Talbot telegraphed on the 16th March through Sir R. Wingate [tfo. 279]saying that Idris El Senp was pressing the Italians for a reassuring reply to his request forthe opening of markets  and facilities for his operations against Nuri Bey [brother  ofEnver Pasha] in Sirt [a  maritime district south of, the Gulf of Syrtis]-if they do not satisfy him he would probably suspend negotiations and go west to look after his affairs and asking whether if the Italians agreed to open  markets  he should open ours.  Efesaid that in his opinion the blockade  would never  compel  Idris or the Arabs  toaccept Italian domination, and that the best course for  the Italians to adopt would beto back Idris  against his rivals.   Sir R. Wingate telegraphed  on the same  day sayingthat he thought  Colonel Talbot&apos;s opinion  in regard  to Italians  supporting Idris against his rivals to be sound.   As to the opening of markets, he  thought that we should probably conform to: the Italian action.   In reply to these two telegrams Mr. Balfourtelegraphed on the 20th March [No. 277] that he  approved.                          ,                                  ABYSSINIA.                               The  Arms Question.     Mr.  Balfour telegraphed to Captain Thesiger on the 15th March [No. 24] that  inregard to the reported suggestion of a present of arms from France  the French Govern-ment had stated that his French colleague had been instructed to refuse the  request for arms.  The French Government concurred that  all questions concerning arms shouldcontinue  to be dealt with by the three Governments in  agreement, j                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.                                   Operations.     Sir B.  Wingate telegraphed on the 15th March  [A.B. 997 I  that on the 13th MarchBir Derwish had been reconnoitred by aeroplanes from the forward landing ground atBir Abbas : there were fifty-five tents and shelters, but little transport; the camp wasactive.  Ar, 5 miles south of Bir Derwish, had been evacuated.     The  Arab  Bureau telegraphed  on the  18th  March [A.B.  028 and 029] thatit  was  reported  by   Sherif  Faisal  that information  has  been received  thatJemal Pasha the  Less had ordered  the withdrawal  to, Tetankhurmash  El  A fchaliof  the Akaba  garrison..   Mushash-um-Taila  near  Khasham   Got  Tareif   (Sinaimap  Oil).   Tetankhurmash  El  Athali probably  near.  Also that  it was reported by  agents  from Medina  that trainloads of  refugees were  leaving for  the  northdaily, but that none were allowed to  go south.   The majority  of the  inhabitantshad  now been  deported.   The  Mosque  El  Haram  was  being  dismantled ;  thecarpet and all the gold  ornaments had been  removed.  The Imam El  Haram  was still in Medina, also Sherif Haidar and Fakhri Fasha;  but all  other notables had left.[1 group]  large house  full of  sickness,  caused  chiefly  by lack  of  food.

Therumour that  large biplane fell  about a month ago while flying  over [2  groups]  is confirmed.  The inhabitants of Medina were now reported to be very \bitter against theTurks......     ,             :  ( ;&apos;   ft telegraphed three  times on the 20th March [A.B.  050, 051, and  052] thatSherif Faisal nad received a letter  from Ibn Rashid,  who declared himself hostile to theSherif of Mecca.   Faisal was of opinion that Rashid might attempt to occupy Nakhailand  Hanakiya, and  had requested Sherif Abdulla to  increase the garrisons of thoseplaces.  Further information from  Turkish prisoners captured on Hejaz Railway was tothe effect that recently &apos;200 camels had left for Rashid with supplies of arms and money,and that  there were still awaiting  him at Dar el Hamra  on Hejaz  Railway 300 camels&apos;loads.  At the present juncture a diversion against Mecca by Rashid  would greatly assistthe Turks,  and any action  that  could  be taken to prevent this,  by Saud  and other friendly  chiefs,  would  be  desirable.  Faisal  was  asking Nuri Shalan to act  from.the north against Rashid [050].                                           .       [898-35]                                                       .  D
     It was stated by prisoners captured on the Hejaz Railway that during the last monthno troops  had gone to Medina,  but troop movements had taken  place from Medina toElula and  Medain  Salih.  They stated  that troops in Medina were short of clothes,boots,  and supplies.  Orders  had  been given  for  troops  from  advanced  posts  towithdraw on to Medina  and the railway.  Faisal was still at Wej, but Lawrence had gone to join Abdulla [051].     On the 10th March Sherif  Zeid cut the  telegraph 15  miles south-east of Medinaand killed  fifty mules and  horses.  Next day, near Awali, he captured fifty rifles andtwenty camels and killed many mules and camels.   On the 8th and 9th March Zeid&apos;scamp was  visited by two enemy &apos;planes,  but no damage was done.  Aeroplanes had allarrived at  Wej safely [052],                        Congratulations from King Hussain.     Sir R.  Wingate telegraphed [No. 269] that he  had received the following message from King Hussain :           &quot; With all my heart I  congratulate your Excellency over the occupation of     Baghdad by your valiant troops.  It is only  meet that this city should thank God     Almighty for its liberation  from the criminal  hand  of the Turanians.  WTe shall     hear if God wills of similar, good  news from  the Western Front.   I pray the     Almighty to  grant victory  and success to  all  those who are  defending justice,     civilisation, and the liberty  of nations which  has been transgressed upon.&quot;     He was  instructed [No. 270] to  return a suitable  acknowledgment to  KingHussain and to Emir Faisal.              Application to French Government for Wireless Telegraphy.     The French Ambassador informed the Foreign Office on the loth March that KingHussain had applied to the French Government  for wireless  telegraphy apparatus forthe purpose of establishing communication between  Wej, Rabegh, Jeddah, and Mecca.The French Government, before  taking any step,  wished to know the opinion of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.                             Ottoman Bank at Jeddah.     Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 21st March [No. 309] that he  had heardprivately that the  directors of the  ex-Ottoman Bank  at Jeddah had received a letterfrom the Foreign Affairs Department at Mecca to the effect that the Arab Governmenthad not been recognised (? by) industrial or financial houses, and that consequently theOttoman Bank was not recognised by the Arab  Government, which could not accept any responsibility in its regard.   The Governor of the Bank  at  Jeddah had  acknow-ledged receipt of this  letter, and, Sir R. Wingate understood, was seeking from Meccaan explanation of its meaning.ADEN.                                   Operations.&apos;*- -  The G.O.C. telegraphed on the 17th March [No. 479] saying that seaplanes had that morning photographed and bombed Turkish dispositions, and also had reconnoitred for mines.  Valuable work had been done.   He telegraphed again on the 19th [No. 484]that it was indicated by reports received that  material and moral damage had beendone by the combined artillery and seaplane bombardment on Saturday, and that bombs had been dropped on Sunday.                                     SYRIA.                            French Troops for Palestine.    The French Ambassador informed the Foreign  Office on the 14th March thatarrangements had been made for two battalions of Algerian tirailleurs to be in readiness to embark by the 25th March.   Three companies  of territorials would  be sent later on.The  French Government is also preparing an  alpine ambulance to accompany thedetachment.
11120              i                  Italy and Palestine.     In a despatch dated the  14th  March  [No. 55] Mr. Balfour informed Sir R. Roddthat, in the course of conversation on the Asia Minor questions, the Italian ambassador had referred to a report that the French were going to take part in military operations.in  Palestine.  He claimed  that, by the arrangement come  to between the Allies,Palestine had been internationalised, and that it followed from this that whatever was conceded to France ought also to be conceded to Italy.                                MESOPOTAMIA.                         Sir Stanley Maude&apos;&apos;s Proclamation.     On the 19th March a proclamation made in the Baghdad vilayet by order of His-Majesty&apos;s Government.   The following is the English text:      To the People of Baghdad Yilayet :     1. In the name  of my King, and in the name of the peoples over whom he rules,I address you as follows :     2. Our military  operations  have as their object the defeat of the enemy, and thedriving of him from these territories.  In order to  complete  this task I am chargedwith absolute and supreme control of all regions in which British troops operate, but ourarmies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but as liberators.     3. Since the days of Halaka your city and your lands  have been  subject to thetyranny  of strangers, your palaces  have fallen into ruins, your gardens have sunk indesolation, and your  forefathers and yourselves have groaned in bondage.  Your sonshave been carried off to wars not of your seeking, your wealth has been stripped  from you  by unjust men and squandered in distant places.     4. Since the days of Midhat the Turks have talked of reforms, yet do not the ruinsand  wastes of to-day testify the vanity of those  promises ?     5. It is  the wish not only of my King and his  peoples, but  it is also the wish ofthe  great nations with whom he is in alliance, that you should prosper, even as in thepast, when your lands were fertile, when your ancestors gave to  the world literature,science, and art, and when Baghdad city was one of the wonders of the world.     6. Between your people and the dominions of my King there has been a close bondof interest.   For 200 years have the merchants of Baghdad and Great  Britain tradedtogether  in mutual profit arid friendship.  On the other hand, the Germans and Turks,who  have  despoiled  you and yours, have for twenty years made Baghdad a centre of power  from which  to assaii the power of the British and  the allies of the British in persia  and Arabia.   Therefore the British Government cannot remain indifferent as towhat takes place in your country now or in the future, for, in duty to the interests of theBritish people and their  Allies, the  British Government cannot risk that being done in baghdad again which has been done by the Turks and Germans during the war.     7.  But you, people of Baghdad, whose commercial prosperity and whose safety fromoppression and invasion  must ever be a matter of the  closest concern  to the  BritishGovernment, are  not to understand  that it is the  wish of the  British  Government toimpose upon you alien institutions.  It is the hope  of the British Government that theaspirations of your philosophers and writers shall  be realised, and that once again thepeople  of Baghdad shall flourish, enjoying their  wealth and substance under institutionswhich  are  in consonance with their sacred laws and their racial ideals.  In Hejaz theArabs  have expelled  the Turks and Germans who  oppressed them, and proclaimedthe Sherif Hussain as their King, and his Lordship rules in independence and freedom,and  is the ally of the nations  whp are fighting against the power of  Turkey  andGermany; so, indeed, are the noble  Arabs, the Lords of Koweit, Nejd, and Asir.     8.  Many noble Arabs have perished in the cause of  Arab freedom at the hands ofthose alien rulers, the Turks, who  oppressed them.  It is the determination of theGovernment of Great Britain and the Great Powers allied to Great  Britain that thesenoble Arabs  shall not have suffered in vain,,  It is the hope and desire of the british people and the nations in alliance with them that the Arab race may  rise once more togreatness and renown among the peoples of the  earth, and that it shall bind itselftogether  to this end in unity and concord.     9.  O people of Baghdad, remember that for twenty-six generations you have sufferedunder  strange  tyrants,  who have ever endeavoured to set one Arab house against another in order that they might profit by your dissensions.  This policy  is abhorrent
to Great Britain and her allies, for there can be neither peace nor  prosperity wherethere is enmity and misgovernment.  Therefore I am commanded to invite you, throughyour nobles and elders and representatives, to participate in the management of yourcivil affairs in collaboration with the  political representatives of Great  Britain whoaccompany the British army, so that you may be united with your  kinsmen  in north,east, south, and west in realising the aspirations of your race.                                   Ismail Bey.     Mr. Chamberiain  telegraphed on  the  17th March to the Government of Indiaasking that Ismail Bey should be informed that it  had  been  noted with regret by HisMajesty&apos;s Government that  he and  his clan had  ceased to protect Christians ; it was assumed that they had been misled by Turkish and German agents.   He should be told that we would readily afford him  personal  protection, but could  only accept theco-operation of the Milli  tribe on the condition  that it returned  to the traditionalpolicy of his  father, Ibrahim Pasha, and proved its good faith by helping Armenians,whether at Deir-Es-Zor or elsewhere.  Should they do this,  we should be glad to enterinto negotiations with  them with a view to concerting such co-operation  and renderingit effective.                                 Persian Interests.     With reference  to  Sir C. Marling&apos;s telegram of the  14th  March in regard toPersian holy places and Persian  subjects in Mesopotamia [Eastern Report VII, p. 3J.Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the  Viceroy on the  20th March [P.  1117] that every opportunity ought to be taken to conciliate Persian opinion.                                    PERSIA.                                 Bakhtiari Road.     Mr. Balfour instructed Sir C. Marling on the  17th  March [No. 83]  that he shouldtake no action in regard to this road pending final instructions, as  he (Mr.  Balfour) feltthat it would be better to decide between the alternative routes, in consultation with messrs. Lynch, before  approaching either the French or the  Russian Government.                   Kerman-Bunder Abbas and J ash-Ling Lines.     Sir C. Marling was  informed by the Foreign Office on  the  16th March [No. 81]that he might negotiate with the Persian Government  on  the lines  he  had suggestedin his telegram [No. 6] of the 3rd January.                             THE  PERSIAN  GULF.                    Suggestion that it should be a mare clausum.     Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 1 7th March  [P. 920 b] that itwas  not worth while to pursue this question.   [See Eastern Report VI, p. 5].FHIMTID AT THE TOKEIGK OWICS BT C. K.

From the beginning of the war to November 1916, if there was any Turkish orSenusi pi-opaganda in the northern provinces of Nigeria, its effects were negligibleand  its reception  cold.  Certain persons were captured during 1915 who declaredthey were  Turkish agents,  but it is extremely doubtful whether they were in factsuch,  and  whether their professions  were not  induced by  an  inherent  love  ofcharlatanism and the ordinary motives of a mendicant.   But it must be remembered that to the Fulani rulers of Northern Nigeria, and stillmore to their subject people the Hausa,  all that comes from the East is an object ofveneration ; hence  any wandering Muallim or professed saint  or  political agent is always certain of food and hospitality.  The people live and have lived apart from thegeneral current  of the Muslim  world, and have not the slightest real interest  in  orfeeling about many of  the questions which loom so large  in Eastern politics.   Theyhave never heard of the Agha Khan, hardly know that there are  such people as IndianMuslims, and loqk  on  the  Sultan of Turkey merely as a peer of the Emir of Sokoto,who himself professes to be, and to them is, the only Khalif (Amir ul Muminin) that matters.   In fact, they disregard all Muslim history between the death of the last ofthe four &quot;rightly directed  Khalifs &quot; and the accession of the  first Fulani  Emir -Othman clan Hodio in 1807.   The British Government  has pursued a policy of retaining under the  guidance ol:Residents the native rulers  and their Muslim polity, shorn of abuses ; so that theupper classes in  Nigeria have everything to lose and nothing to gain by  any kind of disorder at least, most of them have.   Many  of  the chiefs especially those  who owed  their  position entirely  to theBritish Government were extremely uneasy about the War up to the date of the fall of Garua in the  Cameroons.  There can, I think, be little doubt that German agents(probably agents of the  German companies trading in Nigeria) had promised nearly all the deposed  Emirs and other chiefs out of office a speedy  return to power werethe Germans to be successful locally.    W ifch the fall of Garua, however, and subsequent conquest of  the Cameroons,  rulersand people became entirely reassured.  The war to them was the  war in the Cameroons.The war  in  Europe was  too distant and too imperfectly envisaged really to affecttheir minds for  the most part, except that in large  centres like Kano,  where thereexists a fairly lar-ge Tripolitan colony, there was undoubtedly a certain undercurrent ofsentiment for the  Turks, and pious hope that they might recover North Africa.  Inthis connection the Germans were viewed merely as the instrument by which the  Turksmight come back to their own.   It will be apparent that no anti-German propagandaof ours would probably affect these views.   Were  Nigeria  an isolated country,  there would  be  little  more to say about  its attitude to the War, and one could almost have said for certain that nothing would gowrong there.   Unfortunately,  however, it  is impossible to  consider Nigerian  politics  without reference to the countries to the  east and north and west  of  it-the Eastern Chadbasin, the Sahara, and the Western Sudan -because  really the whole Sudan belt isone country with no real geographical obstacles, with  homogeneous peoples having acommon religion, and with few or no real racial antipathies.   From Darfur  to the  Senegal  and  from  Yola to Agades  the chiefs  exchangepresents and news, and are often united by marital and  other  ties.   While they arenot intolerant Muslims as  a rule, they are far more fervid believers in and votaries ofthe essential tenets of  Islam than the average Turk or Arab of North Africa.  Theywould be quite capable under certain circumstances of fighting for their  faith as did the dervishes at  Omdurman, though that is hardly a likely contingency in Nigeria solong as their Muslim life and social order are protected as  they have been since 1903.Up to the present the pride of the Fulani in their own  position and history has entirelydiscounted the political influence of  external sects.  The Emirs have usually dismissedSenusi agents with presents  and nothing more, not because they disapproved of theiraims, but because they would not be patronised by Sidi Ahmed  or anyone else.

    There would, however, probably be  a  point  at which their general sentiment  for Islam and an instinctive desire for independence and freedom from Christian control might get the upper hand of their discretion, and assert itself.    That point has (since 1914) been brought appreciably nearer by two things.      (1)  The Italian evacuation of the  Tripoli hinterland.      (2)  The French  &quot;conscription&quot; of Sudanese natives for service in France during             1915-1916.    The  Italian  evacuation of the  Tripoli hinterland  produced an  immense moral effect all  over the Sudan,  and especially in Kano, which is so closely connected with Tripoli commercially.    The  French &quot; consci-iption&quot;  of natives  for active service has  embittered  and envenomed not only the  vast  bulk of  the Moslems  to the immediate  north of British territory, but a very large number of our own  people who are in many ways closely connected with them.  &quot; Here,&quot; say they, &quot; have these  Nassara (Christians)  been for &quot; twenty years preaching and legislating against  slavery, and  now they  themselves &quot; are slave-raiding our villages and taking away our children to fight for  them.&quot;   It would appear peculiarly.unfortunate that the French did not  except from this system certain parts of the Western Sudan, for, as far as can be judged from Ivano information, they have thereby made the local leaders of the Tijani tarikh (a sect generally considered the most  friendly to Europeans) extremely hostile and anti-French.    Any intelligent and well informed native will tell oue that the French haAre ruined the country  to the  immediate north of Nigeria, and European  merchants at Kano concur in that opinion from their point of view..    As is  well known, and was in fact to be expected, Turkish and Arab agents have succeeded in stirring up the Tuwareg in the Sahara, and sporadic outbreaks have been going on  for the past year.  Officers from Bilma, Agades, and other posts who passed through Kano last autumn were  all very pessimistic as  to  the  state of the Sahara.&apos; The French  have killed a great many of certain tribes, e.g.,  the Ulimmiden, but the Tuwareg are born fighters, and keep returning  to the charge by committing some new outrage from time to time. Just before leaving Kano in. November 1916 I heard that the Kelgeres had ambushed and annihilated a French patrol.    The relations between  Sokoto, Katsina, Kano,   and Bornu   and  such places  as Bilma, Agades, and Tawa are so constant and intimate that the  failure of  the French to preserve order in their territory cannot;but react in greater or less degree on the Emirates of  Nigeria.  Once  the  atmosphere  of unrest is  created,  the   immediate occasion of trouble is more likely to be some petty local affair than any large question of world-wide importance.  As Muslims, the Emirs  can have only one real grievance, i.e., that  they are under  a Christian Government;  but even that disadvantage does not loom large in  their eyes  beside their anxiety to maintain their prestige among their people, and the personal security of themselves and their families.    It will, therefore, be  apparent that the potential sources  of clanger in Nigeria are rather among  (1) people of the ruling caste who are not actually in power,  (2) the rather  limited  class of pious fanatics, or clever  charlatans,  and (3) the ignorant peasantry, than among the actual rulers of the country.    The latter will  probably continue in the future,  as in  the past, to discourage any society or propaganda which might cause an upheaval.  It must be added, however, that the more intelligent and informed  Emirs who know something of, or are in touch with, the-East regret that Great Britain has been compelled  to act against Turkey in Arabia and  Persia.  This is, I think, due to a fear  that we may become too much involved  in Arabian politics.   On the  subject of the declaration of independence  by the Sherif of Mecca, their attitude was one of doubt whether he would  succeed in maintaining his  independence a doubt  mainly due to past history ;  but at the same time their sentiments are  certainly not unfriendly to the Sherifs  position, and, in fact, with their particular views of Muslim history, there is every reason to think that they would prefer to regard an Arab of  the Kuraish  as the Eastern Khalif  rather than the very distant, shadowy, and  &quot; ajam &quot; (foreign) potentate known to them as  the Sultan. of Stamboul.    There can be  no doubt that, if a safe pilgrimage to Mecca is assured to them under the new regime, they will ultimately not only acquiesce in it, but welcome it.March 2nd, 1917.H. R. PALMER.
