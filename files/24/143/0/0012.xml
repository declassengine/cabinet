SECRET.154APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT,  No. XII.                                      RUSSIA.     THE declarations of Prince Lvow regarding war aims are evidently temporising, and have been made  intentionally vague with a  view to avoiding anything calculated to  alienate  the Socialist and  extreme elements from  a desire  to  carry on the war. Until the situation in the capital improves, any public  declaration regarding Russian territorial ambitions in Turkey is probably  deliberately and wisely withheld. ;    The  executive power of  the  Government in  Petrograd itself is evidently still ineffective, as may be judged from the significant telegram regarding the price of bread and the pay of the militia.   The Northern Armies in front  of  Riga and Dvinsk are still in a deplorable state.     The telegram from Odessa is much more encouraging, showing as it does a different spirit and state of affairs in Southern Russia.     Perhaps the most unfortunate  result of the Russian revolution is its effect upon  a possible  offensive  by the Caucasus armies.   It is most regrettable that we cannot feel assured of a combined offensive against the Turks in all their theatres.     Envers tales of peace talk between Turkish and Russian  soldiers we have heard of before and may discount.  Any suggestion regarding a separate  peace made by Enver are made for consumption inside Turkey, and until Turkey has been hit much harder, or has been delivered from financial dependence on Germany, are  unreal.x                                    TURKEY.     The discussions in Switzerland regarding the Caliphate are interesting.   It may be that in the last resort the Turks may try to compound with the King of the Hejaz by offering him a shadowy  form of spiritual  authority without  any temporal power. King Hussein is sufficiently acquainted with Islamic tradition to know that any such titular Caliphate, such as was suffered by the Mameluke Sultans of  Cairo between the fall of Baghdad and the Ottoman conquest of Egypt, is never likely to be worth  much again.   The whole essence of the Caliphate is independent temporal power, and without this there is  no chance  of his obtaining recognition as Caliph by Sunnis in India or elsewhere.  Any idea that we or any other Christian Power can obtain the recognition by Moslems of a Caliph of qur choosing is barren in the extreme.     With regard to the mention of the name of the  Sultan of Turkey in the public prayers, King  Hussein  has always  been careful hitherto to make it clear that his quarrel is with the CUP. and the Turkish  Government rather  than with the Sultan, and any attempt  to  influence Moslems in  their action in this matter would  seem premature, and must be left to the Ulema themselves.                            ../        SENUSSI.    The success of Colonel TalboPs efforts  is most gratifying.   The point now arises asto how far Mohammed Idris can deal effectively with the pro-Turk elements round SidiAhmed and Mohammed Saleb.[898-39]
 Operations at  Salif.     The immediate object ofc&apos; the naval attack on  Salif (on the North Yemen  coast near Ka.1ns.1ran Island), which took place on June 12, was to recover the salt-refining  and other plant belong- ing to Sir John Jackson.&apos;s Company.   Salif, which is the principal source of salt on the Bed Sea coast,  and  the  head of a caravan road to Central Yemen via  the  Wadi.  Mur, was fairly strongly held  by  about a full  company of  Turkish  regulars  with two-mountain guns and  three machine gruis.   The district has been notorious  for  some time as a centre of blockade-running and aggressive action against our patrols.  Pending a  fuller  report, we put on record that the place was captured after a three  hours&apos; fight with a loss to ourselves of one  Boyal Marine killed and two wounded.   The garrison lost six killed and. eight wounded and the balance of seventy-three  unwounded men. were captured. Besides these, two military and eleven civilian officials were made prisoners.   We held the place for two days.   The salt-plant and lighters were found  much deteriorated by rust and  neglect, and little  was worth removing except some pumps, which have been shipped to Katnaran.  The  distilling plant was dismantled.  All was finished by  6 p.in. on June 14, and the landing party and ships were withdrawn. Yemen News,     From news sent by Aden, under date June 18, it appears that much  fighting  has  taken  place, and  is still going  on, in Yemen  both south and. north.   The Itadaa,   district, up to the borders of Yafa, is still  occupied by Mohammed Seif-el-lslaru and an  Iniamite force of  .1,500 men, which was sent two months ago to  operate, against  Juban, Nawa and Kubiatein.   The Mausata sheikhs have had to  watch their frontiers  to prevent trouble with this force.  The Taiz  district  is thoroughly disturbed  chiefly through  the combined action  of Ahmed Pasha with the new claimant  to  the Imamate,   Seyyid  Mohammed  Yaiiya.   The former is reported to have lifted L.T. 2,000 in bullion  oil its way to  Lahej and  to have turned, some 2,000 Dhu  Mohammed and Dim Husein tribesmen loose into the region.   The Pa dan  Arabs also are  said to be joining Seyyid Mohammed, who has received. dues  from  the  greater part of the Hashicl and the Bekil as well as lesser  tribes  like the Harridan. The Imam Yaiiya  is stated to have  warned, the Turks  that they are on the point of losing all Taiz.   In the north, Ion el-Heij is reported by Kamaran to have definitely seceded from the Turks  and  to be co-operating with Idrisi.   The latter&apos;s action  against  Ibn  Tliawab and the Abs tribesmen, on  May  1-1, seems; to   have  been  a serious   affair resulting in unusually heavy casualties.    Idrisi is reported to be steadily gaining the  upper hand.
ARABIA.     The  Turkish forces  in the  Hejaz  are  now divided  into two distinct groups :(1) those  in;Medina  under Fakreddin, and (2) those on the Hejaz  railway betweenMaan and El Ala under Kuchuk Jemal.  Each group is about 5,000 strong.   the communications between these two groups are  growing more and more precarious, andthe frequency  of  the  raids  by the Arabs upon various widely divergent points on therailway is all that can be desired.   For a detailed statement of the composition of theTurkish forces in  this area, vide &quot; Arab Bulletin&quot; (Cairo), No. 46.                                  MESOPOTAMIA.     The stir that has arisen over the visit of Indian journalists to Mesopotamia is clear evidence of the  danger on  political,  if  not  on  military, grounds  of allowing  press correspondents of any kind  in this area  at present, when it is so  essential  to avoidarousing Arab suspicions  as to our future intentions.  There is no doubt  that the spread of any idea of the  economic  exploitation of that country by Indians or forIndians would be hotly resented, and would make the future settlement of the countryan even more difficult problem than is already presented.

RUSSIA.     The  Constituent Assembly. Prince Lvow told Sir G. Buchanan on the 14th April[Telegram No. 526] that the Constituent Assembly could not, possibly meet for at least six months, perhaps not for a year.   Whatever party got the upper hand, it would notbe the workmen :  the peasantry would be the deciding factor at the elections, and, aswomen were to be allowed to  vote,  the Assembly would probably  be conservative in character.  In  any case,  monarchy was now out of the question, and Russia would undoubtedly be a republic.     &quot;Peace loithout  Annexations.&quot; On the same  occasion,  in  answer  to  Sir  G.Buchanarfs request that he should define the meaning of &quot; peace without annexations,&quot;Prince Lvow  said that the Allies  need, not  be  alarmed  by a  phrase which in no waymodified the original programme.   If  the war went  well, those who now spoke of thepermanent occupation of Galicia, Constantinople, &amp;c, as annexation would regard it asliberation from an enemy yoke.     Congress  of  Representatives of  Working Men  and  Soldiers&apos;  Delegates. At  itssitting  on the 12th April  the congress discussed its  attitude towards the  war, arida resolution proposed by the executive committee was passed by a very large majority.After  expressing  a determination  to  apply  to  foreign  policy  the  principles  already declared for the internal life of Russia, and its appreciation of the recent declaration ofthe  Provisional Government  [Eastern Report xi, p. 6], this resolution laid down that each nation of either coalition must insist on its. Government obtaining from the Allies       [898-39]                   &apos;                                          B51Arabia.    *Hejaz.       Operations.Mesopotamia.

a general renouncement of all  annexations, and that the Russian Provisional Govern-ment should negotiate with its Allies the drafting of a general agreement in this sense.The people  of revolutionary Russia would  continue  their efforts for the  expediting ofpeace on the basis of fraternity and equality of free nations ; and the official renounce-ment  by all  Governments of their programmes of annexation would  constitute  a powerful  weapon  for the cessation of war on these conditions.   But for so long as thewar should continue, the  Russian democracy recognized that  the disruption  of thearmy,  weakening its strength  and capacity  for active operations, would be the greatest possible blow to the cause  of  freedom and to the vital interests of the  country ;  there-fore the congress called upon the democracy of Russia to mobilize the whole living  forceof the country and all branches of the national life.  The resolution concluded with  astrongly worded appeal that all workmen enterprises engaged, directly or  indirectly, on war work, should make every  effort to guarantee the providing the army with  every-thing necessary.   [Petrograd telegram No.  520.J     The Army.. Prince Lvow  told Sir G. Buchanan on  the  15th April [TelegramNo. 526] that during his recent visit to headquarters he had found General Alexielf far-more optimistic about the military situation than he had  been  a fortnight  ago.   Anall  Russian  army congress was shortly to be held as a counterbalance to the workmen&apos;scongress, and  already resolutions in favour of  war  to a finish had  been passed bycommittees  of officers and   soldiers,  of which there was one in   every  company.Dvinsk, Riga, Helsingfors,  Kronstadt, and Petrograd were  the weak points in anotherwise satisfactory situation,  while  even at Petrograd, which must not be taken as the standard of military efficiency, things were improving.  A conference had  beenheld at headquarters at which it had been unanimously decided  that the state of thearmy would admit of its taking the offensive, the Government considered  that more harm than good  might be done by interfering  with the agitators who  went  to thearmy : they would meet with  no success.  General Alexieff had himself dismissedseventy-six  generals  as incompetent and many  of the junior officers  who  had  been removed at  the instance of the soldiers fully deserved it.   Supplies were  now reaching the army more&apos; abundantly, and in spite of the time lost by the revolution the russian army would to-day be able to  give the Allies far more effective support than under theold regime.  The army and even the Petrograd  garrison had  offered  lo suppress thecouncil of workmen  and soldiers&apos; deputies  by force, but  such  an offer  could not beaccepted when expressing the cost to the  change of planning  a counter revolution ;moreover, the leaders of the council had shown their  weakness by refusing to acceptthe responsibility of office and he was not afraid of them.     sir g. Buchanan  telegraphed on the 15th April [No. 528] that M. Miliukoff had told him that  a certain control was  now being exercised  over visits to  the front,  and where  there was a  reasonable  supposition that such visits were  to  be made  tosubvert discipline, they were either forbidden or steps were taken to keep the agitatorsunder  observation.  A deputation from Kronstadt,  he  said, had asked permission to visit all  the armies at the front, but the Government  would only allow them to go tothe Riga  front, where they would be carefully  watched.  In regard  to this Sir G.Buchanan telegraphed on the. 16th April  [No. 529] that the condition  of Kronstadtwas still deplorable ; even the  so-called selected officers had to live in barracks  withthe  men and  to  feed and work in  the  factories with them; and some of the  bodies of the murdered  officers had not been buried.  It  was, he said,  criminal to allow adeputation from these men to  visit Riga.     In the same  telegram he  said that: (l) the.military strength  in  Petrograd andthe district  12 miles round was 280,000 ; (2) Gt-neral Kornilov&apos;s  staff officer had statedthat he  had  obtained permission from  the Executive Council of  Workmen&apos;s andSoldiers&apos; Deputies and from the Military Commission of  the Duma that draft companies should be sent to the front from  the depdt units, in  Petrograd, and  it  was hoped  thatsome would be sent off on the  28th April; (3) the units at  Novgorod  had sent  drafts,and small detachments of artillery had gone to  the  front from  the neighbourhood of petrogard.     Telegraphing on  the 17th April [No. 537], Colonel  Knox said  that an-officer  fromthe 20th Finnish Fusiliers  at  Riga had reported that  the  109th and  110th divisions had refused to  remain any  longer in  the trenches  west of  Riga,  and  had  been withdrawn to  the  right bank  of  the Dvina.  In his opinion, the  men would now neverassume the offensive, and he was doubtful whether they would  hold the  ground  ifattacked.   Riga, he considered, would be taken by the Germans whenever they wishedto do so.
3156      The  Navy. Sir  G. Buchanan-  telegraphed  on  the  14th April [No. 525] that Prince  Lvow  ha.d  said  to  him  that the  fleet had been the worst feature in the revolution, but the situation was nearly restored.  At  Kronstadt, with  the exception of one  district, things were  nearly  normal  again.   Prince  Lvow  admitted that a fortnight&apos;s work had been lost, but said that the work in the mines was now proceeding at full pressure.      Committee of Officers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Delegates  at Odessa. The British consul at Odessa telegraphed [No. 31] that on the receipt of a radio telegram on the 13th  April, reporting the continuation of the victory  at Arras, a delegation from the committee, of officers&apos; and soldiers&apos; deputies had called to congratulate him.  Congratulatory  speeches were made, and he replied.   An hour later he called on the committee and was received with great applause.   He thanked them  in  a speech which was very  well  received. They asked him to convey to the British nation their congratulations and  the expression of their firm intention  to  carry the  war to a victorious end.   The  president of the workmen&apos;s committee, who was present, asked him to  convey a similar message.   The consul was invited to listen to their debate, and was much impressed by the earnestness of all to put the full energy of the nation into the war.      Bread in Petrograd. Sir G Buchanan telegraphed  on the 16th April [No. 529] that bread which  cost 10 kopecks a  pound  was  sold  for 7,  and it was  considered. to be  inadvisable  to raise  the price ;  consequently,  the municipality  was 2,000,000 roubles out of pocket on the  feeding of Petrograd  since the revolution.      Police Pay. In the same telegram Sir G. Buchanan said that the old police were- paid 25 roubles a month, but the militia which had  taken their place got a rouble an hour, or 280 roubles a month.      M.  Sazanov. Sir  G. Buchanan telegraphed on the  14th April [No. 524]  that M. Miliukoff had informed him that as soon as the British Admiralty could arrange for his travelling in safety, M. Sazonov would leave for England.      Russian Socialists in Switzerland. Sir  H. Pinmbold  telegraphed from Berne on the  13th April [No.  289] that be had learnt that a party of forty-two Russians had left Zurich  for Germany on the 9th April;  there was a small demonstration in their favour at  the railway station, and a counter-demonstration  against them  as traitors and German agents.   And on the  loth April the  Foreign Office telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan [No. 716] that it had  learnt from a reliable  source  that  three Russian Socialists, pacifists  and ex-officials of the late Duma, had been given passports by the German consul-general at Zurich for a free passage through Germany to Stockholm.                                     RUMANIA..      General de Candolle. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Barclay on  the 13th April [No. 128] that His Majesty&apos;s Government felt bound to  afford all the help and guidance which  Rumania cared  to accept, and generally to show  that it took a close interest in her, regarding as  it did  the situation in  Rumania as  most  serious.   To help in the reorganisation of the railways is one of the directions in which  this could best be done; that every facility should be  obtained for General de Candolle and  his staff was therefore essential.  It was also essential  that the Roumanian Government should realise that minor  considerations, such  as accommodation and. the  susceptibilities  of individual Rumanians, could not  be allowed  to stand  in the  way of his  mission.   Plis  Majesty&apos;s Government had every hope that Russians  and Rumanians  would eventually realise that the gravity  of the situation rendered it necessary that  they should sink their differences  and accept the  advice,  if  not the  control, of a  British railway expert. Mr. Balfour said that he was fully aware that General de Candolle would be faced with much obstruction,  and that he  would  be  forced  to  insist  upon many unpalatable measures,  and, for this reason, it was all the more important that the Rumanians should have no reason for imagining that his actions had not  the entire support of the British Legation and Government.  Sir G. Barclay was  therefor d authorised  to  use his utmost endeavours  to induce  the Rumanian  Government  to afford  General de Candolle all possible support.   Any hesitation or obstruction on its  part could not fail to  create an unfortunate impression on His Majesty&apos;s  Government, whose one desire is to lend every assistance to Rumania  in her present difficulties.
                                   TURKEY.     Peace Talk in  Constantinople. Sir  C.  Spring-Rice  telegraphed [No. 1007] from washington on the 17th April that the State Department had communicated  to him atelegram,  dated  the  4-th  April, received from  the United States Ambassador  in constantinople.   The Ambassador said that Enver, who had just returned from Berlin,was reported to have described  the  military situation of the  Central Powers as satis-factory, and also to have announced  that peace was  imminent.   Such statements, andthe  current report that the British authorities (? in) Bagdad were accepting Turkishpaper lira at 18s., had  caused certain stocks to fall, as well as  the price of gold, whichthe  Turkish Government was  buying.   Early in February, the German Embassy had circulated reports to the effect  that peace would come  about the 15th May.  ManyTurks SHAV salvation in the Russian  revolution, which they anticipated  would increasethe desire  for peace and force  the  Provisional Government  to  make  peace with theCentral Powers.  The  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  had stated  on the 3rd April  that russian troops had informed Turkish troops opposed to them that peace would come within ten days, and that further fighting was  useless.   Such rumours  all raised thehopes  of  those who desired a  separate peace, and it is believed that many Turks do.They are doubtful,  however, whether the Allies would enter into negotiations.  On theother hand, German influence and that of the  pro-German military party was apparentlystrong enough to frustrate any such design.   Peace talk had  been current recentlyamongst Turks and Germans,  but  these rumours were  probably circulated for the express purposes  not  only of quieting the masses in the capital  and provinces,  whoopenly proclaimed their weariness of  the war and desire for peace, but also of facilitatingspeculation in  gold and securities.     The Caliphate. An  agent  reports  that  early in April  a meeting  was  held  inLausanne, under the presidency of Vehbi  Bey, director of the, Turkish schools in. Bagdad,to discuss the  question of the Caliphate.  About fifty CUP. Turks were  present, anda number of them addressed the meeting, Vehbi Bey and Jemal  Bey (president of theC.U.P. Lausanne) being the principal speakers.  They made a great point of the  factthat all  Turks should  unite  against  England, whose intention  was to rob Turkey  ofthe Caliphate and hand it over  to  the  Arabs, making Syria a  vassal State of GreatBritain.                                 THE  SENUSSL     Agreements with Idrisi. Colonel Talbot telegraphed on the  12th April [No. 46]that Idrisi had, with a very good grace, accepted all of our conditions, only askingpermission to have  some 50 police round Jaghub  to control his Arabs.    He  had  also accepted  the Italian conditions, which had reference to  the  modus vivendi on whichthey insisted.  Two days later, telegraphing again [No. 501, he said that in consequenceof  a communication received from Borne he had  advised Idrisi  to accept the modus vivendi ;  and on the 17th he telegraphed [No. 51] that all agreements had been  signedand that he was leaving for Sollum.                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.     Operations. Sir R. Wingate or the  Arab Bureau telegraphed as follows:      12th  April :  Arrived Wejh  5 shaykhs of Shaalan  house, including nephew andcousin of Nuri offering  co-operation  of Ruwalla tribes to Feisal.   Also arrived Audah,chief Tayaha,  section Huweitat,  together with two other shaykhs. same section.  Alsochief Muhallaf, allies  of  Ruwalla, and  seven Sherarat  shaykhs  and  two Sakhr.[A.B. 267.]     In  the raid  against railway on the  25th  March between Darelhamra and Sanaa,stream was cut, 110 rails (?) were destroyed,  and 21  prisoners taken.

This-appears to be large bridge over Wadi Mandh at Abu el Nairn.  [A.B. 278.]     15 April: Arabs, according to information derived from sure source, are attackingMoadhdham  and Khishm Sana stations in  force with guns.

[A.B. 295.]                                 MESOPOTAMIA.     Unwelcome Visit of Indian  Journalists.-Sir  P.  Cox telegraphed  on the  6thApril from Baghdad saying that on the 3rd April his deputy at Basra&quot;had telegraphedmentioning the visit of a party of Indian journalists, four Indians and four Europeans.Sir P. Cox had  been informed by his deputy at Basra that these journalists had comewith the   natural  idea of writing up Mesopotamia with  a view  to its exploitationby Indians ; they  had interviewed  the  deputy  desiring information principally as to(1) the future  policy of the British  Government in regard to this  country;  (2) theprospects  of Indian immigration :  (3) the prospects for Indian traders ; and (4) the formof its future administration.   They did not appear to take kindly to the pro-Arab idea.Sir Percy  Cox complained that these journalists should have been despatched withoutascertaining his views, and said that  the policy of the Government being what  it was,.their visit was in his judgment wholly mischievous from the political point of view andcalculated to alarm&apos; our friends in the vilayet  and make them  suspicious  of  ourbona fides and of our ultimate intentions ; as chief political officer he would be placedin an exceedingly awkward  position  ;  he urged that the  party should be  turned  back from Amara  on some pretext,   and unless  this  were done  he begged  to disclaimresponsibility for the  evil  consequences or prejudice  to the declared  policy of theGovernment which might result  from the  visit.   Some  harm, he said,  must  already have been done at Basra.     The  Viceroy telegraphed on the 9th April that the object of the press tour was toallow  journalists. to  carry out political  investigations, but to see the conditions under-which the troops operated;  the  original idea was that they  were to be  under themilitary.   The Indian Government thought that the position should be fully explained to them, and these articles be subjected to strict censorship by  the political authoritiesin Mesopotamia ; if this were done, it thought they might be allowed to go to Baghdad.,The effect of stopping them at Amara would surely be bad.  In any case, his Govern-rnent strongly  deprecated any differential treatment  between  European and  Indianjournalists ; it would be a grave  error to  stop the  latter and to allow the former toproceed.     In reply to this,  Sir P. Cox, telegraphing  on the  following  day, said that thewu-itings should of course be censured, and he was not apprehensive of them, but of theeffect likely to be made on the sensitive minds of the Arab party by the mere fact of a visit, immediately on our occupation, of a large party of  Indian journalists, and by theloose talk of those journalists which it would be impossible  to prevent.  Importantpeople, he said, like  Shukri Alusi had  shown apprehension lest that  country should become an appanage of the Government of India.     On the same day the G.O.C. telegraphed that the journalists were in charge of MajorPulley, whom the Chief of the General Staff bad suggested as suitable to conduct the party,and that doubtless he had received fulHnstructions before sailing.  He himself had issueddetailed instructions as to a  strict censorship, which was carried out  by the generalstaff;  the difficulty had arisen, not in connection with this, but in regard to the casualconversations with individuals in various places which it was impracticable to regulate.     On the 13th April Mr. Chamberlain  telegraphed to  the Viceroy that the tourshould be curtailed as much as possible, and should not extend beyond the Basra vilayet ;       [898-39]            1                                             C
and  articles  should be censured.  Both  applied  to  Europeans  as well as to Indians.There was no objection to the military situation being used as a pretext.  [This hadbeen suggested by the Indian Government.]     Prayers for the Sultan of Turhey. The Viceroy telegraphed to Sir  R. Wingateon the 30th March saying that Sir P. Cox had  enquired  as to the practice  in Egypt inregard to the mention of the name of the Sultan of Turkey in prayers in  the mosque,the question  having arisen in respect of the  Baghdad mosques.   On the 31st March,Mr. Chamberlain enquired as to the practice  in British India and the native States :  inreply, he was informed  that the practice varied both  in British India and in the nativeStates.   No  prayers  are  offered  for  him, either  by name or as a caliph in Punjab  orthe North-West Frontier province, while he is generally prayed for as caliph in theUnited Provinces.  And so in the native States, he is not prayed for in Tank or Indore,but in Hyderabad he is prayed for by name as before the war.   In reply to the originalenquiry, Sir  R. Wingate said [No. 360] that the  practice in  Egypt since  the rupturewith Turkey had been to  pray for the Caliph of the Moslems  without naming him andfor the  Sultan  Hussein  of Egypt by  name.  The Sudanese practice was generallysimilar  to the Egyptian.  At Mecca the prayer contained no mention of the Caliph butthe Sultan of Turkey was prayed for as &quot; Sultan and son of a Sultan, Mohammed Rashed,&quot;King Hussien  himself  being  prayed for  as Emir of Mecca  and King of the arab countries.  Sir  R. Wingate added that  he thought we should maintain official reserveon this subject  on the ground that, it was  a  religious  question which Moslems must decide for themselves, though at  the same time, unofficially, attention might be drawn to the  Moslem  practice  in Egypt and  Sudan as a convenient j)alliative [n  presentcircumstances.   On the 12th April Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed  to the Viceroy  sayingthat His Majesty&apos;s Government concurred in views expressed in Sir R. Wingate&apos;telegram, and Sir P. Cox  might proceed accordingly.                                    PERSIA.    A Proposed &quot; Council of Empire.&quot; Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 12th April[No.  135 A] that there was a growing agitation in favour of a newMejlis, and that theCabinet proposed to meet the clamour for  control over its actions by the formation of a&quot; Council of Empire,&quot; which would really be a sort of advisory committee to the Shah ;the idea being that it would relieve him of all  responsibility,  and would act as a bufferbetween the Ministers and their  enemies.   Both  Sir  C.  Marling  and the RussianCharge&apos; d&apos;Affaires  regarded  the  proposal  with the  greatest misgiving,  but  it was probably less open  to objection than  a new Mejlis which, if elected  on the old lines,would prove no better than its predecessors.  There was, Sir C. Marling believed, verylittle real feeling in favour  of the  Mejlis in the  provinces, and it was to be expectedthat there would be a very general abstention from voting, except on the part of the professional politicians,  who  had given all their  support to  the Germans, and whowould  probably be able to return a  large number of  deputies.   Even the proposedcouncil would be better than this, but its utility must depend on its composition, andhe suggested that, in case the  Cabinet should be forced  to resort to this expedient,  heand the Russian  Charge dAffaires should be  authorised  to  inform it that their governments could not agree to the inlcusion of persons known  to have actually espousedthe German cause against our interests.    Mr. Balfour  telegraphed  to Sir G.  Buchanan [No.  718]  on the  16th April,instructing  him  to inform  the  Russian Government  that  he,  Mr. Balfour..  agreed with the views  expressed  in Sir C. Marling&apos;s  telegram, and to  invite  its concurrence.    Persian Prisoners in Russian Custody. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 12thApril [No. 135] that the Russian  Charge  dAffaires having informed him that the custody  of ther  Persian  prisoners was  most  embarrassing  to  the  Russian militaryauthorities, they had consented to  deliver all  but three most  guilty  to  the  PersianGovernment  at Kasvin.   [See Eastern Report X,  p. 6.]                                     INDIA.    Mutinous  Conduct  in  a  Brahman  Regiment  in Mesopotamia. The Viceroytelegraphed on  the  17th April that  the General Officer  commanding Force &quot;D&quot; had reported trouble in the 3rd Brahman battalion on the line of communication owing  to
r158the introduction of the group system of messing in place of the individual system, which prevented its employment in the fighting line, and  necessitated its relegation to theline of communications.  Owing to its mutinous conduct a portion of the regiment hadbeen disarmed.  A court of enquiry had assembled, and further  details would be sent.    General Military Situation. In the same  telegram the Viceroy  said that therewas no change in the general military situation.                                AFGHANISTAN.     General Military Situation. The Viceroy  reported  on the 1st April that therewas no change.ADDENDA.                                    RUSSIA.     The Navy. The  naval attache at  Petrograd  telegraphed  on the  18th  April[No.  544]  that he had taken  an opportunity of a lull  in  affairs to get first handinformation of the state of the Black Sea Fleet  by calling Commander le Page toPetrograd.   Commander le  Page&apos;s information bore out what had already been heard in Petrograd  that the  change of Government had been accepted by alb in the Southwithout any bloodshed,  and, as regarded the fleet, had caused displacement of but fewofficers; in  other words that the revolution had  practically not affected the militaryefficiency of the Black Sea squadron.     Odessa. The consul at  Odessa telegraphed on the 18th April [No. 34] that he hadbeen informed by one of the Executive Committee of Labour deputies that the workmenwere arranging for the  maximum production of all factories now.  The War industries committee said that they were  going to work 24 hours daily  ; that they were sendingdeputies to the coalfields to arrange for a fuel supply, of which the stock was sufficient for immediate  needs;   that steel  was sufficient  there  for 10 weeks; and that theircommittee would discuss economic demands with employers &quot;when the men were at work.Female labour would be more  widely employed.  When the  production of the abovefactories was fully developed then others would be reorganised.    Russian Turkestan. The assistant military attache telegraphed on the 17 th April[No. 541] that news  had been  received of  a  serious mutiny  of troops and  natives inTurkestan.  The mutiny was said to have been engineered by German agents, a  great many of whom had recently arrived through Mongolia, and many had probably been released during the revolution from prisons  in Siberia.  General Kuropatkin had been removed from his post as Governor and imprisoned by troops.     It  was  said that  the German agents  were also  trying  to  stir up  trouble in afghanistan.                                   TURKEY.     The Caliphate.  According to a well-informed agent it is reported that the TurkishGovernment has decided to endeavour  to come to terms with the  King of the Hejaz,offering him and his descendants the Caliphate with spiritual powers only.                                MESOPOTAMIA.     The C.P.O. and Local Notables. On his arrival  at Baghdad, the C.P.O.  sentfriendly letters to the chief Mujtahids of Kerbela and Nejef individually, and since then two political officers, with an  escort of Shaykbs, have been visiting Kerbela andNejef,  incidentally calling  on the chief Mujtahids to  enquire after their  welfare onbehalf of the GOG.   These officers had not finished  their tour at the time of report(13th April).  In the meantime, Sir P. Cox  had received cordial letters from severalMujtahids, among whom Saiyid  Abdul  Hussein Tabatabai, one of the three leadingMujtahids of  Kerbela, enclosed a telegram  addressed to His Majesty the King foronward despatch if there  was no  objection.  The translation  of the  telegram  is asfollows : &quot; I and all the spiritual leaders of Islam here offer your Majesty our heartfeltcongratulations on the conquest of Baghdad.&quot; DAB-ES-ISLAM.riUNTED AT THE SOKSIiS OVIMCB BT C.

ARABIA.                          Hejaz.                   Summary of Intelligence.     The situation  south of.  Medina has not  greatly  changed.The Turks, though they have evacuated Bir Aar, still  hold  Birel-Mashi and Bir Derwish in force too great for Sherifs Ali andZeid to attack ;  but the former post is reported surrounded and both posts lack transport.  Both Sherifs have been  sending  outraiding parties against the enemy  communications, and Zeid&apos;sbands . are  stated to  have pushed as far as a gate of Medinaand  Jebel  Ohod and to have returned  with  prisoners.  Zeidhimself has his headquarters at Mijz, where his force amountsto some 4,000 men  with  three guns  and six maxims, served bySyrians.  Ghayir is held for Ah by  Sherif Ali ibn Areidh.     We have reason to know that Medina is to be evacuated bythe Turks as soon as possible, and that such  of  their  troops asreach El-Ala will not remain long there or even at Tebuk, wherethe composite force, sent down to  assist in the extrication of the expeditionary Force, is centred.   It is reported that  defencesare  being  prepared at  Aqabat el-Hejaziyab,  the third stationsouth  of Maan, and it is possible that the enemy will attempt nolong stand south of that point.  Meanwhile  the civil populationcontinues to  be sent north  from the city, but is  stated  to becarried by train no further than Hafira (only twenty-one miles),and there left to proceed by road  as best it cam  Shops are saidnow to be almost all closed and food is fast running out.   Thegreat mosque is stripped bare.  The number of sick soldiers  is great and increasing.     The problem of evacuation is becoming daily more difficult.Abdullah now reports that his raiding parties have  destroyed sixculverts besides the Wadi Hamdh bridge, and  that no trains had passed north or south between.the date of this demolition (aboutMarch 3) and  the  date  of his report (Mar-ch  12).  Far  to thenorth, between Matalli and Qalaat  Moadhdham, Colonel Newcombereports that Sherif rTasir&apos;s party destroyed two (and possibly four)engines, as Avell as 350 rails on the permanent way, on or aboutMarch 8 ;  sixteen  prisoners, including a representative of IbnRashid  were taken, and the line was left in such a state thatit was calculated  it  could  hardly be  repaired in less  than a fortnight  under the  most favourable conditions.   Details will follow in  our  next issue.  Further  raids  are now proceeding.Prisoriers taken on the line reporc  fifty men at Qalaat, Muadhdhamstation, but only ten to twenty at others.  Ten days&apos; food findone month&apos;s  water at each  station.  Spare rails and telegraph wire both  scarce.   Four Germans at Abu  Taqa station sinking wells.   Supplies of  arms and foodstuffs  have been, and  are, going up to Hail for Ibn Rashid  from Dar el-Hamra.     Five  hundred  camel-men of the Rawalla, Beni Sakhr, and Sherarat have come in to Feisal at  Wejh.
             Past Relations between Mecca and Hail.     The following is an extract from an  undated  letter  recently written, on behalf of the King of the Hejaz, by Ahmed Saqaf to Major Pearson, in reply to inquiries by the latter whether the King  had  confirmation  of a report that the Turks with Ibn Rashid had gone to Teima, and that  Shaalan envoys had reached Abdullah ::  .     &quot; Ibn Rashid has been holding aloof  from us during the last two years  and this is principally due  to the intrigues of one of his  relatives, named after  his mother, Rashid ibn  Leila, to whom  the  Turks gave the title of  Pasha in order to secure his interests in their propaganda.  We became hostile to Ibn Rashid when  he  declared war against  Ibn Saud  and each advanced against each other at the end of Dhul  Hijja month, 1334 (1916). Ibn Saud  started from   Qasim,  Ibn Rashid from  El Dahna. Then took place the&apos; well-known battle of Jerrab, where Ibn  Saud was -defeated and  most of his men were killed amongst whom was a  foreigner,  perhaps an  Englishman in command of the artillery.&quot;;     [Note. i.e., Captain Shakespear, who  was only present as a  spectator.  Jerrab is near Mejmaa in Sedeir.]     &quot;Abdullah  was on  his way to the scene of action, before the battle  of Moharram  1334,  at the  request of Ibn  Sand;  but unfortunately, he was not in time for the battle and was  obliged to halt at a village on the borders of the Hejaz called Sharaa, S.E. of Aneizah,  the capital of  Qasim  (about  130 kilometres distant) and about 150 kilometres  from the scene of the battle.&quot;     [Note. Sharaa is on  the Mecca-Riyadh road, about 400 miles from the former,  in Ateibah territory.]     &quot; Emir Abullah warned Ibn Rashid (who could not maintain his forces where  he was)  against advancing on the  villages of Nejd and the estates of Ibn Saud.  So  lbn  Rashid returned to his own country,  and  Abdullah  returned to Mecca.   This was when Turkey declared war, and at the time when bad  relations began  between us and the  Turks ; because they asked, when they heard  Abdullah was  in  action,  that he  should come  to Medina and proceed with  his brother Ali to Sinai to  co-operate with  Jemal  Pasha.  Ibn  Rashid&apos;s   people  consequently   were unable to make the pilgrimage  in 1334.     &quot;Matters continued thus until the  chiefs  of  the  Shammar tribes discovered the  mistakes  of  Ibn RashkTs policy.   Then these men began to send us  their  excuses and continued up  to the time  when  our revolt took  place ;  but Ibn Rashid stated, &apos; I have nothing to do with the revolt of  the Sherif, because my position precludes  me from anything  except helping  the  Turks to whom allegiance is due.&apos;   We set Ibn  Rashid aside and wrote to the Shammar chiefs, such as Ibn Tawala etc., that the mind of Saud Ibn Abdul  Aziz (i.e., Ibn Rashid) being under the influence of ignorant advisers, we were compelled to inform them  that if
he-continued this policy we should be obliged to take, unwillingly,strong measures against; the Shammar.   These warnings  had.agood -result,, and in . the  last three months we have  receivedspecial information that a  friendly feeling for us has arisen ;  andeven  Subhan, the. Chief who is. under Don Rashid, wrote to usthree  weeks ago that.the  Turks  had come  to  Ibn Rashid  andcompelled bim to assist.them.   Subhan had warned Ibn. Rashid,that, if he movedslsouth to, fight, against the: Sherif, Subhan  and&apos;Ibn Tawala  would  go straight to Hail and teach him  a lesson.Ibn Rashid did hot  comply  with the Turkish, demands stating.that he was unable to do so.  . .    ,                ,.    &quot; This is the summary of that which you inquired of us.    &quot;Doubtless,  in time &apos; Ibn&apos;  Rashid  will  correspond  withAbdullah or Zeid, but Nuri Shaalan has detached some people toAbdullah about 300 camelmen,  sent by Nawaf; the son of Nurihimself.  As you have previously heard,  Abdullah has armedthem  from  the arms at Yambo and given them  hospitality and-agood  deal of. money.&quot;&apos;                              &apos;;    !i  r; : -                 Raid on  (he Hejaz Railway.     The  following  is  a   summary,  with  Occasional  textualquotations, of Bimbashi Garland&apos;s report of his recent expeditionfrom Wejh to cut the Hejaz railway :      The  party  accompanying  him was  provided  by  SherifFeisal,. and  was composed  of  Sherif,Abdul  Kerim  Beidawi ofthe Juheinah  Sheikhly family, two  other Juheinah sheikhs, oneBilli and one Aneizah  sheikh, twenty-four men of the Juheinahand  Aneizah, and Ali Nafgan with twenty-three&apos; men of theAgeyl.                 -       ^  .,             ^   ,     Although Feisal,  in choosing  Abdul  Kerimto  lead theparty, no doubt thought he was giving a good man, and certainlyan influential one, it early became, clear ,that, no more unsuitablechoice could possibly have  been  made.  &quot;Absolutely incapable of action, criminally haphazard and  careless,  he was responsiblefor all the delays of the party and for none of its successes.  day after day he took us miles  out of  our course, or held the partyup for hours merely; that he  might  fraternize  and  feast;.inBedouin encampments  en route.  In,this way he advertised thepurpose and  composition  of  the  party wherever we went and caused no little anxiety to the Nasrani, who was regarded as asort of a curio by the women and children of each  camp.  .  .   .It is distinctly inconvenient to have a,person  of the dignity ofSherif who finds  his chief pleasure  in dismounting to be  kissedby passing kinsmen.  .  .  ..  With  so bad a leader, his Juheinahtribesmen  were no better, but the other sheikhs, the few  Aneizah,and the Ageyl behaved splendidly.&quot;             ....     Progress under this incapable chieftan was abominably slow.the average  number of riding hours each day, notwithstandingBimbashi  Garland&apos;s continual remonstrances,  being only five and
a&apos;half.   The camels were  bad and the saddles, worse..   the animals were  not properly  rationed and  there was very littlesuitable green  odder growing on the road.   On  camping, theArabs would allow their camels to roam about in search of food,so that when the time came for departure, it sometimes took overan hour  to  find  the animals  before loading could be begun.&quot; Military work  of any  kind is difficult even with  the best: of arabs.   The majority  show no  respect  but,  rather,  someinsolence.   They continually  incur  unnecessary risks by  theirstupid conduct, such as singing and shouting within hearing ofthe enemy, and approaching  enemy  positions  (as  the party didon the1 railway line)  up the middle of broad wadis that could be overlooked for miles by any  outpost  on the top of a hilh  In one place, as  we neared a Bedouin  encampmenl, 1 asked one of theAgeyl of what tribe the Bedouin were, and whether  they were forthe,Sherif.  ,&apos; No,&apos;he replied,&apos; &apos;not  for  the Sherif ;  for Britishgold.&apos;  In tins part.of the world, gold  is  how so plentiful thatthe British  sovereign  may  almost  be&apos;said to  be the unit ofcoinage.   The filthiest Arab unearths (the term is no mere facon deparler), a bag of gold when making his purchases in the Suq,and theypay   50 for a camel as an  ordinary procedure.&quot;    Notwithstanding  these  disconcerting  elements  (BimbashiGarland  says that  at  one&quot;  stage  he was firmly convinced thatAbdul Kerim had no intention of  ever reaching the  railway line), the. party, which  had left Wejh on  February  12, diet:reach  the vicinity of the line towards  sunset on  February 20,the distance being something Over  120 miles as the crow flies.The &apos; Aneizah scouts, reported&apos; all clear ahead,  and; the  partyarrived within about 300 yards of  the railway  line.   One man ofthe Ageyl was sent  forward to ascertain whether it was safe and possible  to  take  the camels  any  nearer.   He  reported that itwas&apos;;  but Abdul  Kerim and  his Juheinah could  not be  induced to  approach any nearer. Bimbashi Garland, however, and theAgeyl,  with  several  sheikhs, went for w-ard on their camels,finally  dismounting  and securing them about  150 yards fromthe railway  line.   Abdul Kerim and his men stayed,at the firststopping place 300 yards away, chattering and lighting cigarettes,and  in  general  giving  away  the position to  any Turks who might have been about.  On reaching the line, the raiders  founda small  two-span, strongly-built  bridge.   Some  of the  Ageylwere  instructed about  the charge  to be  used and the position inwhich it was to  be  placed, while  Bimbashi  Garland wentsouthwards along  the  line  about:  400 yards,  accompanied byAli Nafgari and three sheikhs, to  lay the first mine.    Up tothis time, they believed  that  the  guides bad; as; they stated, ledthem to a  point roughly midway between two stations, Toweiraand Mudurij, about fifteen miles apart.   They  had been preparing the mine about  five minutes  and  the  hole for  it was half dug,when one  of &apos;the Ageyl ran  up  saying that he  heard, a  train approaching. It being  contrary to  all  his information  that the Turks should run trains in the dark, Bimbashi Garland, hearing
nothing himself, proceeded with the arrangement of the  mine,but a few minutes later, much to his astonishment, heard a trainleaving a  station,  blowing off  steam, and whistling.   The fact was  that  the guides had taken them  to  within 500  yards of therather important blockhouse of Towreira.     Bimbashi Garland&apos;?&apos; original intention had been to destroy&apos;thoroughly about  500 yards of  rails, and, at points  a quarter ofa  mile  on each  side  of  the section destroyed, to  lay a heavymine adjusted  so  as  to be exploded mechanically  by  the firstlocomotive travelling each way : then, after  laying the mines,he would  withdraw  to the top of some adjacent  hill until  atrain came along,  to  see  that the mines worked, and if not,  tore-adjust  them  at some   convenient  time  in  the  dark.   the approach  of  the  train,   however,  five  minutes after  startingwork, forced  him  to  decide in  a moment whether  to  stand byand  let the train pass,  and lay the mines comfortably afterwards,or lay a reduced mine and wreck the train  without blowing it up as  badly as a large mine would  have done.  He decided onthe  latter  course,  filled the hole with explosives, and  had justcompleted the  mine to find the train  approaching  within 200yards.  He bolted into the night, making slow and painful  waybarefoot  (having  removed his  boots so as  to leave no tell-taleprints) over bad ground,  and turned after fifty yards in time tosee the mine explode, much closer to himself than was desirable.He saw the engine rock, leave the rails, turn over and  fall witha  crash  down  a  small   embankment.   Soon  after,  militarycommands were  heard, from which  he formed  an  idea that itwas a troop-train, which was confirmed subsequently by reports from Arabs who  passed the scene later.  Notwithstanding therisk of  delaying their departure, Ali Nafgan  and several Ageylran  down to the  charge  on the bridge and  fired  it,  and alsotwo  on the rails.   The damage  had  the effect of cutting off the train on   the north,  and  the bridge must  have been  so  muchdamaged  by the  gelignite as  to nepd  completely  re-building.In the dai*k it was impossible to see what damage had been done to the engine.  The party returned  quickly  to. Abdul Kerimand  his men,  but it  was  impossible  to  make  him  move, awayspeedily, and it was certainly not owing to his good  managementthat they ultimately succeeded in crawling Off into,safety.;     Bimbashi Garland has furnished a valuable route-report andchart of his journey up and back.  He followed the  main Wejh-Medina track, which is called  Darb Sultani  and  is  a recognizedpilgrim road.   It proceeds from Wejh to the  fort some - six. milesinland, where are  half-a-dozen good wells. -ContinuingLsouth of east it crosses the broad Wadi Miar and, then!, a tributary, called atfirst Wadi Harraq and then Wadi Masmar, is followed  up.-to ;itssource in low foothills which divide it from Wadi. Hamdh.;  when these have been crossed, the greater wadi appears as. a wide plain.The track, however, bears awaj&apos; north-east again round Jebel Rahland up the tributary Wadi Silla.  On the right is a  small, spring.At the  head of this valley is  Khautlah,  where; is no ! settlement,
  but only a large well, thirty feet deep, and fitted with a new but  useless iron pump (fifty-one miles from Wejh).   Thereafter a low  rocky col is passed and the track turns south-east into Wadi Jedeir,  which is  descended  till it joins  Wadi Ghulal, flowing into the  Hamdh : but without going down to the latter,  the way  ascends  a broad left-bank tributary, . Wadi:  Matta,  where are trees and  camel-grass.  High massifs, Erbut es-Said on the north and Gomir  on the south, rise  on  each  side, and,,over the col between  them access is obtained to Wadi  Miraaka which runs doAvn to  Wadi  Hadud.  It,  is described as  about 1,000 yards  wide.   By this  valley,  and  a  low  pass,   the niain  channel  of Wadi  Hamdh, about  two-and-a-half., miles wdde,  is  reached a^ain,  where it holds many  rainpopls and much  scrub. , (thirty-five miles  from  Khautlah).   The great valley  is now ascended for about  twenty miles, , and  then the pilgrim  track,.  continuing up  the  wadi, diverges to right  from  the line  which ,.Bimbashi Garland had to take&apos; to  reach his objective,  Toweira.   He has, therefore&quot;, seen only,  the,: first  106 &apos;miles  or  so of  this  Darb  es-Sultani,  oh which  lie  found  710 permanent  settlement   whatever  after leaving.Wejh.             , .,     The rest of his route  lay  across country,  the Wadis  Safrah and Jizal being crossed in succession and Wadi El gat, a tributary of the latter (which is itself a right bank affluent of the Hamdh), being  ascended to&apos;the  point where the railway has to Cross it, a little south of Toweira station.  The distance,across country,.after. Wadi: Hanidb was finally: left,  Bimbashi Garland gives as about forty,miles.   In Wadi Jizal he  met with three good wells, but he found the country, increasingly bare of vegetation as he proceeded. His whole march reckoned  by camel-pace (three-and-a-half miles an hour), was 153  miles,  and  he thinks that the Hejaz railway at  Toweira must  be  some  twenty miles  (crowfly)  nearer the coast than our maps place it.  -   .....                 ,,.v; Defences ,of the  Line.          ,&apos;, . .     Bimbashi Garland further reports  as follows: t     It seems that the Turks have a  sj^stem of blockhouses along the line now, something  like a  mile, apart.  There was no barbed wire on the line.  The two posts, were not,-more than 1,500 yards apart,  and he was told that at Toweira a company is stationed. Natives of the district say the.line, is patrolled by troops mounted on camels and  mules ; also, first thing every morning, a  trolleywith twenty men runs from, station to  station to inspect.  Itwasalso reported that  the system  for catching raiding  parties, is asfollows : . Mounted troops .start from the station oii each  side: ofthe section  attacked,, the nprtherlj- detachment proceeding ,S.WJ.and  the southerly  N.W.,&quot;hoping  thus to hold the raiding partyin the resulting triangular area.        - ,       .   &apos;     This isy&quot;the.  first&apos;,&apos; time; -that the Turks have  had a  trainwrecked,  and: it is to be  supjiosed that they  will now have to,search the line  thoroughly  every day  for mines, and that theywill hardly dare&apos;to run trains at night in the future.
    The line appeared  to  be  well-Mid  (technically known asspiked rails  with  wood sleepers)-and&apos; the bridge  was  very substantial  or its size.Camel Forage.    Green food  or camels was  very, sparse  along the  wholeroute.  Although rains had,  alien qufte .reeently, most  of thegrass  and green,hush was burnt  up.:, It vwould,-be inadvisable to move any  large force on the assumption.-that the,camels couldlive on the country..Fuel.&apos;  i:, Fuel was abundant.  The -party did not see a single palm-tree,, or pass  any village  or permanent Bedouin  camp. Water. . Water was abundant and  fairly  good, except in  Wadi Hamdh. ;This, however,  was the best  time of the  year (just  after&apos; the-rains),; and in summer  most of.the natural eisteVhs probably&apos; dry-!up.   The  only  wells,  properly  so-called,/metv&apos;with  were six :outside the fort near Wejh and  one  at Khautlah,  and the  onlyspring, small but,  according to the Arabs,  constant, was in theJebel immediately  south of Jebel Rahl,,about, fourteen.&apos;.;. hours...camel-ride from Wejh.                      ;.,                     MESOPOTAMIA.                         Ismail Bey..     Ismail Bey, son of Ibrahim Pasha  Milli,  arrived  at Zubeiron  December 28, seekhig British protection and offering us  his;co-operation, against the Turks.     &apos;    &apos;    &apos;  ;              \     His father  was the  most  considerable&apos; figure  in northernMesopotamian politics during the last ten&apos; or fifteen years of AbdulHamid&apos;s reign.  He,had established, with the favour of the Sultanand.-of the latter&apos;s powerful, minister, Tzzet Pasha, an, authority which was little short pf  sovereignty over the country between!Diarbekr and Ras el-Ain, and he controlled the northern&apos; roadsbetween the Euphrates and  Tigris.  If his  rule  was not-ran-:unqualified blessing, neither was; it an unmixed evil ;  he^hnrriddVthe smaller tribes of the Euphrates,  and was at constant -logger-:heads with  the Shammar Jerbah and   Sin/jar   Y^ezidis;;  but heprotectedChristians and &quot;provided a  rough and ready administra-tion as good as, if not better than, anything which the Turks had.managed to set up.  His  headquarters, established at  an ancientbut almost obliterated  site, Wiransheher (Antoninopolis), grew-into a flourishing&apos; little  town, doing a brisk trade with the desert.The. opening of the constitutional era brought Ibrahim&apos;s gloiw toan  end.   Local  independence was distasteful to the 0.1*.P. andlbrahim&apos;s personal relations with the Sultan madediim -an  object
of special distrust. - Local, tribes, both (Kurdish and Arab, whohad suffered justly or unjustly under, his.&apos;strong  hand,  were letloose  upon his flocks and fields during his absence in Damascus,whither he had gone with the purpose of  coming to terms withthe new  rulers o  the Ottoman  Empire.  He hurried  back toAleppo, crossed the Euphrates at Qalat en-]Srejm and died in thedesert between the Euphrates and  the  Khabur,  probably  fromnatural causes, for he was ill when he passed through Aleppo.    He left six sons, Abdul Hamid (usually known as Hamud),Mamu (now about 30), Ismail (28), Khalil  Pasha (26), abdul rahman  (18), and Tama (16).  The mother of Mamu, Ismailand Khalil is Khansah Khanum, a  lady  of remarkable  force ofcharacter j who administered the  family  estates when the  eldersons were imprisoned in Diarbekr after Ibrahim&apos;s  death.   AbdulHamid died in prison, but Ismail and his brothers were  releasedafter a captivity of many months&apos; duration, and their possessionswere in great part restored.   Though the power of the rulinghouse had suffered, the Milli  remained a  strong tribe, trained in arms in the1 Hamidiyah levies, while the sons  of Ibrahim  are stillwealthy,  and soldiers from their  youth up.    Ismail is a fair man, of medium height and slight figure,pleasant  mannered,  with  a  fine confident bearing.  He lookswhat  he  is, the son of a great chief, accustomed to  dealing with high  officials, and conversant  with big political  issues.   Hespeaks with affection  and respect of  his  brother Khalil Pasha,who,  according to him, has some  1,400 troops, more  or lesstrained in. the Hamidiyah,  under  his command.  He  himselfclaims to  have about  400  horsemen of a  similar kind, and says that Iris, tribe numbers 25,000 men and can raise 12,000 horse.He includes, no doubt, in these  last. two figures various Arabtribes,  such as  the  Adwan, who  come  directly  under  theinfluence  of the Milli, and probably he intends  them to cover the Shammar Jerbah also.    The half-trained Milli  horse  hespeaks; of.. asthe  Sabyan.   They are all armed  with  Mausersand: have  plenty of ammunition.   He suggests that  he shouldsummon  his 400  men to the Iraq,  if we could get  them safepassage through Ibn Hadhdhafs country.  He proposes  to place them, at  our  service under  his command,  and  to maintainthem  at  his own  expense.   He  is confident  that  Khalil  Pashawould have  no  objection  to  their leaving Wiransheher,  asKhalil has an ample  force  of his own.    Ismail states  that at the  beginning  of the  war the  Millifurnished a body. of  irregular horse to&apos;  the  Turks  for  serviceagainst the, Russians.  The)&apos; deserted during the first winter and returned  home, bringing with them the arms which they hadreceived from the Ottoman  Government.   This led to a  conflict between  Turks  and  Milli  near Diarbekr  about a  year  ago..Ismail claims that  the  Turkish casualties  were   heavy, and included  some  German officers, but the upshot seems  to  havebeen unfavourable to the Milli, and  Ismail fled south, intending
to make his way to-the Sherif by  the hay railway.   He wascaught at Qatranahand imprisoned first at  Shobaq and  then at:Damascus.   After he  had been there  some weeks,  Sherif  AliHaidar arrived, on his  way to Medina.  Ismail begged  for  hisintercession with  Jemal Pasha,  and at Ali Haidar&apos;s instancehe was released, on  condition that he would join the Turkish-force in Sinai;   He  succeeded, however, in making his escape toFawwaz el-Faiz.of the  Sukhur, and  so  by  the Wadi Sirhan  toJauf, where he was hospitably welcomed by Nawwaf  es-Shaalan.While he was at Jauf,  Nawwaf received letters from  the Sherifasking for  his support, but  these he  had not answered beforeIsmail left.  A correspondence was going on between Ibn  Shaalanand  Ibn  Hadhdhal.  Nawwaf had  urged  Fahad Bey  to joinhim  in helping the Sherif, but the latter replied with  character -istic caution that he  was restrained from taking action lest  theTurks should  seize his lands, but  that it would be a different matter if the English offered him their equivalent in the occupied territories.  Ibn  Mijlad  is  hand in hand  with  Ibn Shaalan.Ismail considers that he and Hachim Ibn Muheid (especially^thelatter) are of greater fighting value than Fahad Bey.     Since  the  action a year  ago,  the  Turks  have  left  KhalilPasha unmolested at Wiransheher.   They are afraid  of  stirringup trouble with the  Milli Avho, according to  Ismail, are  bitterlyanti-Turk.   He thinks they  would be prepared to  take actionon our  side on the Turkish lines  of  communication,  and   he agreed that  their help would  be more useful there than at Kut.    - Nawwaf wished him to remain at Jauf, but he was insistentin his desire to come to us, and Nawwaf provided him with  an escort.  He fell in with Ibn Ajil (Shammar Abdah), met RashidIbn.  Leilah near Mashhad, and went from him to AjeimFs camp,where he lodged with a Dhafir Sheikh (Ibn Dhira ?). He con-concealed his purpose from Ajeimi, and told him he was  looking forhis brother Mamu, who, he has reason to believe,  is on his way ;to join Ibn Saud.  Ajeimi gave him rafiqs to Dhari Ibn  Tawala,.Ismail undertaking to return  when he had  made inquiries about.his brother.   Once in DharPs  camp, he  dismissed AjehnFs men,and  came on  to  Zubeir,  where  his arrival coincide P almost exactly with that of  Saud es-Subhan, whose  messengers  he, had.met  while he was with Dhari.               -       -     Ismail reports Ajeimi to be disgusted by the lack of politicalacumen shown  by the Turks  in their handling of the Arabs.   Nodoubt it weakens  his hand with the.tribes.      :    -     -:-&apos;.     The Milli have  no direct  relations with Fahad Bey.   Ismailis anxious to get into touch with him from here.  He looks  ohIbn Muheid as  a friend, and seems to anticipate no difficulty  inroping in the Shammar Jerbah.     Ismail believes that a number of chiefs could  be  induced to:join  in interrupting  the railway and  cutting the  telegraph linealong the Euphrates.  He thinks he can  operate more -easily
from Basrah than from Egypt, and he has been given a house atZubeir.-  He treats Saud  es-Subhan with  respect, and,appears  toallot to him the role of leading conspirator.    The Milli  took  a hand in  the  Armenian massacres,  andIsmail,  though  not  favourably  inclined  to  Turkish  policy,thinks  that in  this  case it  was  justifiable.  He said that  the armenians were aiming at  complete independence,  and  that itwas well-known that the first blood  was on  their heads, theyhaving risen  and massacred the Turks.  This version of the story meets with IsmaiPs unquestioning acceptance.             &apos;,  ,                                   G. L.

The small  force ofrank and file,&apos; reduced by two  years&apos; wastage from one thousandto fifty men,  which was thus left, stranded, put  up a fight, but after losing some twenty killed,&apos; had to: surrender.  ;  The Imam  tells us  that  Ahmed  Teqeiqah, a man of aboutfort)7, has authority for only about two days journey inland, andis not on good terms with the  Beni Atiyah  beyond.   His cousin,Shadli  Alyaii, a.much  younger man, is a rival for the chieftain-ship, but acts under Ahmed and is quite, friendly with him.  TheMidianite Huweitat; can call out about. 2,000 men, but possessless than&apos; 2,000  camels.   Ahmed  er-Rifayah (or  Rafai),  (seeour  No. 42,  p. 82), is  a, villager  of Muweilah, an  old  man of consideration, but without tribal authority.. ,Tiirks  and Bedouin-Sheikhs. ,  .     ,    The share&apos;, under date February 8, states that Jemal Pasha,has been handing out decorations among sheikhs, belonging tothe Huweitat and to certain small  Anezah  units, which  lie east of the  Hejaz  railway,  evidently  in  the  hope  that they  willcounteract the hostility of, the Juheinah, Billi. and  other  tribalelements west of  the line.   Of the  Huweitat,  we  find- in thishonours list,  Hamid Ibn  Jazi,  who is called by the share, GrandSheikh of the tribe, but we do not find Audah  Abu Tayi, themost important Huweitat Chief,  nor- even  Arar Ibn  Jazi, thehead of the  Jazi  section.  Both these last, ;as a  matter  of fact,
have subscribed to King Hussein.   Follows a list o  eight  otherHuweitat sheikhs, none o  note.  Then  we  have Shehab,  Chiefof the  Fuqara,  a poor Anezah tribe, some part of which, at anyrate, was lately with FeisaUs army in Wndi  Yambo ;  their three other sheikhs of.this little group;&apos;  Finally Ferhah,  Chief of  theAida, another small Anezah  tribe, which -also  has  been helping-King  Hussein&apos;s revolt.   (Ferhan himself has  been reported-in communication with the King, but we know from another sourcethat he has also been accepting supplies from  the  Turks, who,nevertheless, are  uneasy  about  him.   Probably  he has been-playing the usual double  waiting  game.   He  commands verytew men, but has some importance owing to  his noble  lineage.Certain other Aida names follow  his.  There is little  reason to doubt  that most, if not all, these decorations  have been wastedon the desert air. Indian Moslems and King Hussein.                   -\    - The Paisa.Alc.hbar (Lahore),of February  1, 1917, publishesfrom  its local correspondent  a  letter,  in  which  he says thatMaulvi Mohammed  Hussein  of  Batala  led the Friday prayersin the Chinian mosque,  Lahore, on January  26,  1917.   Hepreached a sermon, in which he dwelt upon  the blessings  ofBritish rule  and urged all  Mohammedans  in  genera], and  theAhl-i-Hadis  sect in  particular, to remain devotedly loyal to. theBritish government.   At the end o  the prayers, Maulvi Ahmad Baba  Makhdumi,  read  out  the  proclamation  of the  Sherif of Mecca at the  instance  of Maulvi  Mohammed  Hussein.   Whenthe1 proclamation, was being read, the audience  were weeping and. lamenting the disobedience of God&apos;s commands,- in  Mecca,&apos;by the Turks,-as explained in the proclamation-.-  Subsequently, Maulvi Mohammed  Hussein told the audience that, in view of what&apos;was stated, in the proclamation, the Sherif&apos;s dissociation from Turkey was  not. tantamount to rebellion against  Islam.   The Maulvi quoted  a tradition  of  the Prophet iii support of his  contention. He added that the proclamation clearly showed that the Sherif had not put forward the claim of being the Imam of the whole Moslem  world, but &apos; bad  only  proclaimed  the  independence  of Arabia.  ,Jndian Mohammedans  had-no quarrel, with the Sherif  or his  assumption  of the  title  of Amir, nor had they  any political connection with him.  They already did not believe the Sultan of Turkey to be the Caliph of all Musselmans.  After the close  o  his speech, the Maulvi asked those among the audience to raise hands who did not  agree with him.   But  none raised his hand and  all unanimously approved of what the Maulvi had said.      [Note  by  Arab  Bureau. Though &apos;  the  Paisa Akhbar  has its reasons for&apos;being Pro-Government, there need be no doubt  that  what it  relates&apos; took  place.   It is likely  that  some other  similar occurrences have been unreportcd.
     Ahl i-Hadis  (Hadith) is a designation  whicli was assumedmany  years  ago  (probably about  1865)  by Indian Wahabites,when their anti-British conspiracies  brought  them into  disrepute.There are two sects o  Ahl i-Hadis,  viz. the  Gebeli and the Gair-,Gebeli.&apos;   The Gebeli hold that Jihad is  the  botmclen, duty of. allMoslems : living,  under   non-Moslem  rule.    The  Chinianwalimosque in Lahore has been a centre for the preaching of Jihad,and  since  1915  several  Moslem  students  from  Lahore; have crossed  the border to  take part  in the Jihad against us with  the&quot; Hindustani Fanatics &quot; and the frontier tribes.  That  anti-Turksermons should be preached in that  mosque is significant.]Turkish; Paper Currency.&quot; Kyrix&quot; January 29, February 11, 1917.     &quot;A provisional law has been voted in the Ottoman Chamberwith regard to the issue of  paper money  for one piastre andtwo-and-a-half piastres.   A proposal was brought forward  forthe issue of paper money for ten paras (one  para^-^ pias.),andtwenty  paras, but Talaat Bey, Minister of the Interior, explainedthat  there  would  be  difficulties in  the way  of printing suchpaper money, and suggested the use of stamps of five and  ten,paras,as currency.&quot;Turkish Calendar,&quot; La Reformed  -February 4, 1917.:  :   &quot; The Turkish Chamber has decided on the adoption of  theGregorian (i.e.; European)  calendar from  March  1, 1917.

To judge by an  Aden Intelligence Summary, it  is evidentthat- news  of recent  events  is both scanty and  indifferent inthe Hinterland.     Thus, Said  Pasha,  at  Lahej, is found writing letters to theNegus Mikhail asking him to send him  200,000, quite unaware of the fact that since  October last Mikhail  has been a prisoner ofthe Shoan Government.            &apos;     Imagination, however, supplies any deficiencies.   An agenthas brought an official  Turkish proclamation, published at Beitel-Fakili, detailing  all the Turkish   successes  in  the  Hejaz  and elsewhere and giving the terms of peace  shortly to be  ratified.These.include, among other provisions, the  cession to Turkey ofEgypt,  Aden and Basrah.     The state  Of local knowledge maybe judged  by  the  fol-lowing  telegram  sent by Ali  Said  Pasha on  January 7 to  the acting  Governor of Hodeidah,  for publication :-

A disappointed man,he is ready to quarrel with Mohammed Idris, who has been alwayssceptical about the chances of successfully  attacking the British,and is now convinced that the Turks are not in a position to help him.   Idris.&apos; present aim appearsto be to consolidate  himself in cyrenaica by remaining at peace  with the British, and obtaining the best  terms  he  can from-the Ptalians  for  his  benevolentneutrality&apos;towards them.        .  .....

Baruni is  making great efforts to unite  thehillmen and  coastal  tribes  which are  to  take Zuara, the mostwesterly garrison of the Italians.   He sent a bombastic  message to  the  G.O.C.  of  Southern  Tunis stating that he had beennamed Governor of  the  Vilayet of Tripoli, and  that he wouldrestore the Turkish  flag.to all places which it formerly protected,
but  that  he  would not  trouble  the security  of Tunis.   TheFrench  have,  however,  taken measures to meet, any  possibleattack and prevent the  incursion of  &quot; Mehalles&quot;. into  then-territory.  Baruni is  reported  to be collecting; even men armed with  shot guns;  he gives a  false description of the battle atAgelat and promises the chiefs that they, shall take Zuara and obtain the supplies of which they are in such clire need.Abyssinia.     There has been an almost  complete dearth of official  news from Abyssinia lately, and there is  nothing to  record except the bare  facts from  unofficial sources  that the  coronation of theEmpress -Zauditu duly took place ;  that Ras Waldp Giorgis hasbeen  crowned King of  Wollo,  Gondar, and  Begyemdir,  and has proceeded to  Wollo to restore peace  ; that there has been  fighting in-Arousi between Wollo and Shoan forces, Dejaz Balchie havingbeen  sent there on behalf ofthe Shoan/Government ; and- thatLij Yasu is in the fortress of  Magdala, surrounded, by  Govern-ment troops.     We  have had a further warning of  the  extreme tendernessof Mohammedan  opinion oii the subject  of the Khalifate and  ofthe continual necessity  of  the nicest  discretion in approaching&apos;this  question!1 . Seyyid Abbas ;Melki, the Sherif&apos;s representative in Abyssinia, who might have been expected to be an expert, inMohammedan susceptibilities, very  nearly spoilt the situation by certain highly  indiscreet references to  the Sultan, whom heaccused Of leaving, the&quot; true.

The  sheikhs,&apos;greatly offended,  proposed to  withdraw their  invitation to theSeyyid to visit their countey, saying that if  he talked like thatthere he  would produce a riot.  They  were  fortunately  pacifiedby  the  ready  tact of,  Mr.  Archer,  the  Commissioner,  whoexplained that, not appreciating the intricacies of high  Arabic,they must have misunderstood the.

The following is a summarized account of the celebration ofthe festival of  Bairam in the  Mohammedan prisoners&apos;  camp atZossen, near Berlin,  from the German publication &quot; IslamischeWelt&quot; of November last.  As an example of the  readiness ofthe Germans to, avail themselves of the opportunity for a littletactful and effective propaganda, it  is not without interest.     There are,&apos; it seems, some 14,000 prisoners in the camp, fromall parts  of  the  Mohammedan world, and taken from Russians,French and British.     Turks who  were present in Berlin at the time,  and alsocertain German: friends, were  invited to attend the celebration,the Government providing conveyances for them from the. station.
to  the  camp.   One  of the guests writes :  &quot; We saw the  redTurkish flags floating from the barracks and an orchestra playedsome of our national airs.  We alighted in a large square betweenthe barracks, greeted with cries of &apos; Allahu akbar&apos;  (God is great),which echoed from rank to rank.  Then  the sacrifice took place.After prayer, Abdul Aziz  Shawish Effendi,  our great  patriot,harangued the  prisoners.   He first explained  the religiousmeaning of the sacrifice of the Kurban, and went on to say thatMohammed forbade his followers to fight one another, and thatthe  taking of  prisoners  of  war was  also  prohibited by him.&apos; Therefore,&apos; he said, &apos; Germany does not treat  you as prisoners ofwar,  but  as guests.&apos;    He said that this war would end in a victory  to the  Turks  and Germans, and that the prisoners hadbeen  deceived by  the  enemies of Islam.  On this holy day, let them all promise  to unite together to work for the good of theworld and the freedom of their respective countries.     &quot; After a speech by Hakki Pasha, the Turkish Ambassador,who spoke of the benevolent sentiments of the Sultan, &apos;who thinksof  you  all, and loves  you,&apos; we all  partook of the flesh  of  the sacrifice, after which we returned to the town,  and the sight,  aswe left,  of the red  Turkish flag,  spoke to us of victory.&quot;     [Note by Arab Bureau. Abdul Aziz  Shawish,  men-tioned above, is of Tunisian origin.  He first came to egypt in  1904  or  1905, and was  employed in   the  Ministry   ofEducation.  He subsequently was appointed Assistant Instructorin Arabic at Oxford,  but was  for certain reasons,  not entirely satisfactory in  that capacity  and returned to Egypt.   Afterthe  death  of Mustafa Kamel,  he played a  considerable  partas a Nationalist writer  in the &quot; Lewa.&quot;   He  left Egypt  again in about  1910  for Constantinople and consorted  there  muchwith the Young Turk  Party.   Eventually, at the instance of. theEgjqatian  authorities and by consent of Kiamil  Pasha,  he was arrested on  a  charge  of complicity  in a plot  against  LordKitchener, was  brought to Egypt, and tried, but  acquitted.   he returned to Turkey where he is known as a great pan-Islamist.But since  the  outbreak  of  the war,  he has not always beenvery welcome at Constantinople.   He went to Medina  for  the ceremony  of  laying the foundation  stone  of the  Universitythere in 1914, and  says he was to have been  its  first President.He is a member of Enver&apos;s Arab Bureau and acts as a  kind ofamateur father-confessor to Talaat.   He has conducted a violentpropaganda against us for many  years.]

ARABIA.         ,                  Hejaz.                Operation  against the Railway.     A report on his first expedition  from Wejh to the Hejazrailway  has  been furnished by Lieut-Col.  S. F. Newcombe,D.S.O., R.E., under date March 12.     He left Wejh on February 21, with Sherif Nasir (a Shiahfrom Medina) and about  160 Ageyl mostly  mounted two on acamel.  They took eight days to  cover  about  100 miles  to  AbuRaqa,  some  sixteen  miles  S.W. of Khishm  Sana  station,  thecamels being good animals, but somewhat overloaded.  The idea was that the main party,  under Nasir, should attack  Dar  el-Hamra station, as soon as, the morning trolley-patrols had goneout (with a view less to damage  than  to committing the Fuqaraand Moahib tribes, some of whose  sheikhs were acting as guides) :two other parties, going north and south, were to lay bombs and prepare for a demolition of rails and telegraph, to be begun as soonas Nasir attacked.  On March 3, the northern party, under ShawishAziz, guided  by Moahib sheikhs, duly laid two bombs at kil. 842,The southern party, under Newcombe,  guided by a  Fejr sheikh,did the same near  kil. 900, having had to renounce a more distantobjective, south of  Matalli station, owing to the nervousness ofthe  Ageyl.   Nasir&apos;s first  shots were heard at seven  a.m.  andNewcombe&apos;s  party got to work at once, seven Ageyl destroyingabout 100 rails, while others ran  down a  trollej7-patrol, whichhad just passed, and took  eight very willing prisoners.   Aziz&apos;party, having more gelignite at its command, did greater damage to  the line,  blowing up  150 rails.   Fifteen  telegraph poles, in three or four places, were destroyed.  The attack on the  station,however, after lasting four hours  at long range, came to nothing,though at  one time, it appears, the  garrison was on the pointof surrender.   Later  on the bombs laid north  and south  provedeffective, two engines at least, with several trucks, being blown up.     The parties re-united and returned to the  rendezvous for more explosives.  After waiting in vain for Beni Atiyah guides,who finally refused to commit their tribe, Newcombe started offagain for  the  railway, this time to  a point between KhishmSana and Qalaat Muadhdham.  Here an electric bomb  was laidand about fifty charges were fired, destroying some eightj&apos; rails.The bomb was exploded by an engine next daj\   The force thenreturned  to  the Abu  Raqa pool,  but  shortage  of  suppliesprevented it from waiting  there  for a fresh consignment  ofexplosives, and it made its way back to  Wejh, arriving  part  onMarch  11, part later.     The Fuqara,  Beni Atiyah,  and other Beduins along therailway are paid by the Turks L.T.30 and ten loads of corn permensem to guard the line :  but they  are open to arguments fromthe other side, and generally get paid twice over.
     Colonel Newcombe&apos;s road report shows that his course lay for about seventy miles along the northern of the two main Wejh-el-Alatracks, the remaining fifty odd miles, from Wadi en-Nejd onwards,bei ng across country.  After passing the inland fort, and continuingsix miles up the wadi, the track  climbs  a side khor  and thencecrosses a succession of wadis and  rounds the head of Wadi  Sirrto the upland plain of Museirib (thirty-three miles).  The  firstsettlement reached is el-Kurr  (forty-six  miles),  where are.a  fewpalms  and.  wells of  good water, but not above three permanentinhabitants  on the  average.   A second small oasis,. Beida,  is passed at sixty-six miles (it lies three miles west of the main track),and then the Wadi en-Nejd, hemmed in by impassable hills, has tobe ascended.  The el-Ala road  emerges from this  at Ras en-Nejd ;but .Newcombe&apos;s party bore away to the  left up Wa(^i  Arnuwaand  past the springs of Khor  Humad (seventy-six miles)  intoWadi Saad, where a/very steep ascent of 400 feet  (Naqib es-Saad)has  to be  surmounted.  Above  this  the country becomes morebushy, and sandstone formations are encountered&apos; in the precipitousWadi Jizal, the: main ,right bank affluent of Wadi Hamdh.&apos;  At100  miles, the large permanent pool of Abu VKaqa.&apos;. ;%a]9* reachediii a khor, which contains other pools,: and  after that- the  waylies  mostly  over  black hdrrdh, rising to nearly 5,000 feet, flat-topped and seamed with  deep  rifts.   One large &apos;.,,pool ;(el-Shaq)occured at, 112 miles. (4200 feet) &apos; beyond  the  watershed,  and within five miles of the railvvaj7.   The latter hereabouts  ascendsfrom the long, trough, in which it has run  since Batn  el-Chul(about 200 miles),,, and crosses a low  water-parting (3,750 feet)at MatalH,   &apos;  &apos;                       Turkish Forces.&apos;    It is perhaps worth while to recall,, at the present juncturethe composition and strength of the Turkish forces which weresouth &quot;of Maan  two months ago, and. have not  been reportednorth of this point since that date.

The only  addition  since  that  date has  consisted  in two battalions of  163rd&quot;&quot;Regiment, reported  to us late in February asarrived at Medain  Salih and El-Ala  respectiveby.   If the head-quarters of the 53rd Division, to which this regiment belongs,  isnow to be located at Ludd, in South  Palestine, it is possible thatthose two battalions  have been again  withdrawn from Hejaz.     We know also that a composite force, with headquarters at Tebuk, has been formed on the railway and put under  &quot; Kuchuk &quot;Jemal Pasha ; but it is, possible  that  its components  include noelements, not, included above, but have been taken  from the old Hejaz Expeditionary Force (of which we know that the major part, has been, or is being, withdrawn northwards) and from the old L. of C.  Mohafzia and railway7 companies.  The only  information which we have received indicating new elements  is  allusion in native reports to Circassian cavalry at Tebuk and to  new  camelcorps on  the southern  section of  the line,  the. last probably formed from Huteim or other Arabs.              .  :.     Unfortunately  we have no means of  knowing  at  present what proportion  and  individual  constituents  of  the  Hejaz Expeditionaiy Force have been  withdrawn northwards, either to Medina from  the southern  posts (of  which  Bir Derwish  has recently  been evacuated), or from Medina up the  railway ;  nor can  we  estimate the wastage  of the  units of that force from disease, wounds, desertion and  other causes, since  January last. But  since we do  know that   no reinforcements  have reached Medina for two  months  at least, we  are safe in assuming con- siderable reduction of strength  and in regarding the  total of rifles, given  above,  as probably above the real effective at  the present moment.1,500   ,,;  500&apos;700   ,,600   ,,
SINAI.     The following notes on the range,  disposition and tenure ofthe tribes in north-western&apos; Sinai are taken from a recent minute by Lieut.-Col. A. C. Parker, Military Governor  of Sinai :                        Beduin Tribes.Ayaida.     This tribe lives in the  country which  may  be describedroughly as  the triangle Maghara-Um Mukhsheib-Ismailia,  the sheikh Selim Abdullah has been at Ismailia throughout the war,assisting Lieut.-Col. Jennings Bramley, D.S.O., and numbers ofthe men  have acted as British  agents. 1  A  number have alsoacted as Turkish  agents, and  about forty  Turkish rifles  were accepted  by Salman Shereif, the Sheikh appointed By the Turks,and distributed among  the tribesmen at Maghara. jur  Effendi,the Turkish officer at  Maghara,  was always doubtful about the loyalty of these men, and a few  of  them deserted  and came to egypt.,  i :  ,&apos;         - -   -   - ^&apos;   - -    :     -   .     On March 21, thirty-three  of the  Turkish rifles with someammunition  were  brought  in: to.  El Arish  and . satisfactorypromises given for the: collection and handing in of the remainder.Da.wagh.rq,      .   ,,                  t    -                 ,     This tribe normally inhabits  the country  north  of  the lineBir Abu El-Afeiri, a point four miles east of  Salmana,  wateringfrom Abu El-Afein, Bir El-Abd and Salmana.   With the Britishadvance a great number of  the  tribe  was  removed to  Egypt,losing in the process a considerable1 number of their stock, forwhich  .they  have now  received  L.E.300  compensation from government.     Some  of the men remaining  (probably; about ten)  were supplied  with fire-arms by the Turks,  and  these retreated withthe Turks.   Salem Abu Deinat, one of  the  chief  men  of the tribe, arrived at El-Arish from the east on March 21, arid beggedthat the tribe might be permitted to return to  their  land.  the reply given was  that  Id  Sueilim, the  Sheikh now with  theTurks, must first appear at El-Arish, bringing all Turkish  riflesissued.Teaha.  .-.     The area  of this  tribe is roughly bounded  by the lineBodhia-jSTekhl-Kossaima-Helal-Yelag,  though  they own morecountry  to  the  south.   The  sheikhs are  now havering  andwriting letters to  explain that they cannot come in for fear of turkish  reprisals.  They may be expected  to  make submission.shortly.
 Sawarka.     Area roughly  within line  El-Arish-Lahfan-bonndary pillar Katib  El-Arais-Nuga  Shabana-Sheikh  Zowaiid.   This  tribe received  from the Turks 163 rifles.   160 families are settled at Masuri under British  protection.  Sheikhs  of those remaining out may be expected shortly. Terabin.     Maghara neighbourhood,  Mngclhaba  neighbourhood, Wadi El-Amr  (north of Rossaima) neighbourhood.     The sheikh appointed by  the  Turks  is associating  himself with the Teaha policy,  and may be expected  with them . when they come.   He appears to be afraid that some of his- people at Maghara may surrender their Turkish rifles  before  he  comes in himself,  and has sent them orders not to  do so.   The names of two young men who fired on the Camel Corps  patrol at Maghara on its return from  Hassana have been  ascertained, and they  will be punished for it when opportunity offers.            , Land Tenure.     Land  tenure in Sinai is  in a more or less transitional stage.     South of the El Arisli District, the land is divided into tribal areas, in which members of the tribe may graze their animals, or take up for cultivation previously unclaimed land.   Thus a single plough mark round an area gives exclusive rights of cultivation to an individual of that tribe, provided the land is within  the tribal limits and has been previously unmarked.     The tribal boundaries are often vague,and in  dispute,  and cultivating rights have in some cases passed to  members of other tribes.   Where this is the  case,  it will often be  found that the alien tribesmen  have originally been employed to cultivate the land on  account of their  superior industry, paying as  rent  a proportion of the crop, and have gradually obtained an exclusive freehold  owing to the absence  of the  owners  or  to a  series of raihless years, during which the owning tribe has  been unable to uphold its rights.    An  instance of disputed  boundaries is that of the Wadi Masarin at Maghara.  Originally this was probably Terabin land,but the  Ayaida by  some means  managed  to  get  a footing,  and will  in all  probability continue to hold parts of it or  even toextend their holdings.   The easels the origin oE  perennial com-plaints from one or both parties, nor is it  desirable to settle it intoo great haste.    An example of the rights of tribes within their own areasoccurred  some years. ago  in  the Wadi Bruk,  which lies within Teaha territory.   Safaiha  Arabs began ploughing a suitable spot, which appeared to belong  to no one.  The Teaha fell upon them, beat them, and burned their ploughs, and,  according  to Arab, law
nnd custom, had every right to do so, even  though the land wasno  particular  person&apos;s  property,  and  there was no immediateintention  on the part of the owning tribe of cultivating it.     This selfish right appears to have little to recommend it, andto stand in the way of the  development of agricultural possibili-ti.es.  It must  be remembered, however, that  the  primary utilityof a country, where rain is  scarce  and cultivation fortuitous, isfound in  the grazing of stock.  The tribe owning the  grazingrights have, therefore a strong  claim to  be consulted before set-tiers of other tribes, potential thieves of unguarded  camels,, are allowed within their area.     Another interesting land dispute occurred not long ago inthe neighbourhood of Kossaima, the Teaha tribe  claiming to expela certain Haj  Lueimi.  of the  Terabin, tribe,., from areas he wascultivating at  Manbata. . The land appeared.to  be within theTeaha limits.   Enquiry showed,  however, that; a  long  time pre-vibusly the two Tribes had been at war, and that during this period the Terabin had at one time temporarily extended their bound-aries, and; had kept the land sufficiently long to cultivate a partof  it,  thus  establishing a  right.  Subsequently, the  cultivatorappealed to have extended his boundaries by sma]l encroachmentson the surrounding land.  Judgment was given with  the assist-ance of. Arab   Sheikhs,making good the Terabin claim to theoriginal area taken up b)&apos; them but returning to the Teaha the&apos;-land subsequently added.   .  -               &apos;     As regards tribal areas, it is interesting to find some tribes,such as the Safaiha and the Huwetat, which baA^e apparently notyet acquired any legal rights  (according to  Arab LaAv) to any land.   The first named  tribe, a  branch of the Lehaiwat,  appearsto have first entered the country  to assist the Terabin against theTeaha.  ; From  long usage they appear to have established arightto live near Um Mukhsheib, and further south between Mineidraand Majmar, and a few years ago they  laid claim  to the  cultiva-tion area  of Hegaiib, near Jifjafa, but failed in their case.     The  eastern part of the El Arish District has a much greaterrainfall than the country to the south, and consequently containsconsiderable areas of land, which may be regularly cultivated forwinter crops of barley and  wheat and for summer crops of. duraand water-melons.   The tenure of the land  no doubt began inthe same Avay as described  in  the south j but is  more  advanced,partly, owing to the better  conditions for cultivation,  and partly owing to the enterprise of  the people of El Arish in possessingthemselves of lands .and in improving  them.   Most  of the landAvhich is  regularly  cultiAratecl at  present is held by Avhat must beconsidered freehold,. and the owner   has generally a deed of sale or  other  document to prove  possession.  None  of  these  deedsspecify measurements of any kind, but merely the names  of theneighbours, if  such exist;  hence litigation is frequent, and  cases are often very  difficult to decide.
     The system of mortage jilso causes trouble.  Here the personlending the money holds and cultivates the land until the amountis repaid, nor is it quite clear  whether  delay  by the owner inmaking repayment invalidates  his original title in, favour of themortgagees.  It is obvious that any  great delay is  in favour ofthe person  on the  land since,Tf the owner dies,  his heirs may find it difficult to force the holder to return the land in exchange forthe amount of the pledge.     A  case in.point.was  that of: the Gedeirat v.-  Fereig IbnKhalaf, regarding land,at Geraii, which took  place  some yearsago.   The Gedeirat  claimed that  the-land in question had  beenmortgaged  with. Fereig Ibn Khalaf  for  one she-camel.   they desired to  re-pay  this  she-darnel  and to take  possession of theland.   The defendant  claimed, that  the  land  had  been  in his possession for twenty years and  that therefore it was his property.The El Arish Court  heard the case and  gave it in favour of IbnKhalaf.  Subsequently the case was  re-opened, and it was estab-lished  that  the land  had been  in fact pledged for one she-camel,1and  that the right of redeeming this pledge  had been kept  goodby  offers,  made from time to  time by  the  Gedeirat, to  pay  it back.  The land had, however, considerably increased  in value,owing partly  to  the work of  the persons  in  possession.  Theprice of the she-camel was therefore fixed  at L.E. 100, whichwas paid to Ibn Khalaf, and  the land returned to the originalowners.     The western part of the El Arish District, being for the mostpart sand hills, contains very little cultivable land, though  palmtrees are grown in most of the hollows,  where the  water is not too far from the surface.&quot;     North of aline Khirba-Sahnana, however,  there are numbersof patches  of sandy soil which  may be cultivated when sufficientrains fall.   This whole area is now called Zugba and is  inhabitedby  Dawaghra, Bayadiin, Akharsa, Samaana,  and Sawarka Arabs,the  first named being  the most numerous.   Twenty, years agoor more the real Zugba, a small area near the  Bardowil Lagoon,was let by Government for the collection of  colocynth.   Fromcontinual collection the colocynth  became scarce, and the  lesseesbegan to collect a part of the crops  on the ground, graduallyextending  their energies until  they  embraced  the whole area atfirst described.  The system gave the lessees power  to  introduce such cultivators as they wished, and so rendered it almost impos-sible to decide, when the lease was discontinued, who had the bestright to cultivate.  A compromise was  finally reached, but hadscarcely been put into operation before the outbreak of the Avar.:During the investigation of the matter a  ruling was given by thelegal  authorities  in  Cairo that the  land was  Government pro&apos;-&apos;perty, and  that a rent should be charged.
                       ABYSSINIA.                      General Situation.     From reports  recently received  it seems that the  situationin Abyssinia is probably more involved than any known in thecountry for the last  two generations.  It had  been hoped thatthe coronation of Zauditu, as Empress, and of Waldo Giorgis, asNegus of a portion of Mikhail&apos;s late dominions,  would have  aquieting effect.   No sooner,  however, were the ceremonies  overthan news was received  that four  of Negus&apos; provinces, Simyen,Wolkait, Wojju and Wogara had risen in revolt and  that, driven to desperation  by the brutality  of the Shoan army, the WolloMoslems  had  made  a fierce  attack on  Dessie,  and,  althoughdefeated, were  still raiding  the Abyssinian  districts.   Further,the Arussi and certain recently Islamized pagan tribes from Ginirto Dolo, had taken  advantage  of the withdrawal,  during  therevolution,  of   their Abyssinian garrisons,  to  rise, while  theoutbreak of a revolution in Tigre seems merely- a  matter of time.     Lij  Yasu is still  holding out in the fortress  of Magdala andthe Moslem populations of  Abyssinia confidently expect that hewill shortly return at the head  of a large Turkish  army.   HasTaffari, on whom the full responsibility  rests, is surrounded byintrigues of all kinds, both  on  the part of  the  Empress, whoshows a disposition to assert herself, and the ministers, who are mainly concerned with their own  authority and  interests.  Thesoldiers arid lesser  officers are impoverished owing to their longabsence  from  home, and not  only  are driving  the peasanty todesperation by looting for  their own  subsistence, but would notimprobably refuse to undertake a  fresh campaign if called uponto do so.   The risings, of  which every day brings fresh news, donot seem directed  to any political  object, but can be ascribed tothe general relaxation of discipline consequent on the concentra-tion of  the  various  chiefs  to Adis Abeba.  Has Demissie and four Dejazmaches  are concentrated  round  Magdala but make no serious effort against Lij  Yasu,  and  yet  the  armies  of  theprovincial.- chiefs  cannot be sent  home as long  as he remains at large.     The Negus, Waldo  Giorgis,  still  offended  at  his originalexclusion from affairs and at  the refusal of the government  toput Tigre and Gojam under  his  rule, openly declares that hisonly concern is with  the pacification of his own provinces, andthat the  Council of  Ministers may get out of their difficulties asbest thev can.
                   . Personalities and Parties.      The following notes are taken from a Report lately  handed in by Lieut. L.  Buxton on his return from Abyssinia : . Lij Yasu.      No one seems to understand  the character of this  uncon- conventional young man,  who is, perhaps, more far-sighted than  is usually supposed.   When   Regent, he  was frankly bored  by the pomi&apos;) of Royalty,  and made himself extremely disagreeable to the big-wigs  at  Addis Abeba.   He used  to retire into the Danakil Desert  with four or five followers for long  periods, any messenger   who approached  him,  even from  his  irate father, being severely beaten.  The  stories  of his fantastic  behaviour, combined with his  apparently7 genuine dislike of Christians, seem to have made a great impression on  the  Somali  and  other Mohammedan  tribes  of  eastern Abyssinia.    To these people, disgusted with  the brutal behaviour of  the  Christian  soldiery, and influenced by  Turkish  propagandists, he has become a sort of legendary hero,  and in spite of his frequently proved physical cowardice,  they  regard him  as a Mahdi,  who will  assuredly come to  deliver   them from the  hated  Abyssinian  yoke.  His  great scheme to unite the Moslems and rule with their support, (which has been described in  the Arab Bulletin), is  still arousing wild hopes and  causing  widespread  unrest.  At the  same  time  he is quite  capable of  posing  as an earnest Christian for dissolute habits are not imcompatible with religious zeal  in Abyssinia in order to return  to power, and already men are  beginning to say that his return  would be preferable to  the anarchy into which the country is now falling. Pas Taffari.      lias  Taffari  and  Ras  Kassa are  probably the  only two Abyssinians of  rank who are honest and  disinterested, and they are  also the  most educated  and  refined.   Kassi is,  moreover, Taffari&apos;s only whole-hearted supporter among  the  great chiefs. Both trust the British more than they trust any other foreigners, and it was a real complimeirt to our Minister  that  Taffari sent his infant  son  to  our Legation  during the revolution.   Both would like to introduce reforms if they could and dared.   Kassa is not  afflicted with  Taffari&apos;s  fatal  weakness, which  amounts almost to moral cowardice ; but Taffari  has the prestige which attaches to the son of Ras Mahounan,  while  Kassa&apos;s  family  are unpopular.    Everyone  likes  Taffari,  but  nobody  fears  him. Nothing illustrates his irresolution so much as his failure to get rid of the Council of  Ministers, a useless  and mischievous  body of self-seeking intriguers.   The  British  Minister is constantly urging him to establish a small Council  which could  do some- thing  besides talk.   Taffari  knows  that  this  is an  essential reform ; all the big Ras&apos;s would approve, and  everybody  hates the Ministers.   None of the latter  are  powerful  except Hapta Giorgis, who is by far the  best  of  them, and  would support
Taffari.   He controls  the army of  the  Central Government.The Bitwaded or Prime Minister (Haili Giorgis) is the cleverestscoundrel of them all, and has made a large fortune by deliberatescheming for &quot;bribes.   Nearly  all are working exclusively - for personal advantages, while two of them, the Ministers of  justice and Foreign Affairs, are regarded  as pro-Germans and  wouldprobably welcome the return of Lij Yasu  to power.   They were originally&apos; appointed by  Menelik, and  therefore enjOy a  certainprestige, but under  hint they  were mere clerks.The Turco-Germans:. . .   :   . There  is very little that the Germans  and Turks can clo in abyssinia  at  present.   Since  the revolution  it  lias been im-possible for  them  to  obtain the funds with which they wereformerly supplied by Lij Yasu, nor can they now assist in sendingarms to the Somalis.   There  is  probably  still some communi-cation between the  Turkish Consul at Adis Abeba and Ali SaidPasha in the Yemen, but it  is  very  doubtful if anything butletters  could  now  be  carried  through  the  desert  betweenAbyssinia and the sea ; while Ali  Said  Pasha has  presumablynothing else to spare.  It is practically impossible for any Ger-man to escape from Abyssinia, as Herr Gurk found to  his costwhen he was captured  in a  starving condition by  the French.The German and  Turkish   representatives  haAre   no  officialrelations with Taffari&apos;s  Government, and can only help  to keep up ah atmosphere of unrest and suspicion by casual talk  in thecafes  of the chief towns.    Organized  propaganda among the moslem  tribes  has&apos;now ceased, though  the  camel drivers stillvisit the Turkish Consul, and no doubt  carry  messages to theircoreligionists.   But as soon   as the enemy can  send money  toAbyssinia they will again become a danger to our interests, andour Minister has proposed that the German  Legation  shall be withdrawn at the end of the  war.   In  Lij  Yasu&apos;s time it was working to persuade the Abyssinians to attack British and italian territory, and thus divert Allied troops from  the main fronts.Arms were smuggled  across  the  Red Sea and  handed over byLij Yasu  to the  Mullah,   The  Europeans  at Harrar  wouldprobably have been massacred had not the. Abyssinian minority in that town got their blow in first and  massacred, the  Somalis.The Mohammedans.     The Moslem danger is over for the time being, for when  theChristians are not fighting each other, the  Wollos and Somalis &amp;c.can be  ignored.   But  during last November  the  situation was an extremely anxious  one,,  and Lij  Yasu&apos;s  cause was  by nomeans a forlorn  hope.   Had the revolution been postponed  for another.year or  two, he might well  have  succeeded in  unitingthe Mohammedans and making  them  a formidable  power.  his first aim was apparently to unite the  Somalis under the Mullah ;and he has already married the daughters  of  all  the  principalMoslem chiefs of Abyssinia.    And the  revolution might easily
have been postponed, for the  Prince  showed great cunning  insetting one Shoan chief against the other,  so that in  his longabsences  from the capital  they usually  intrigued  against eachother rather than against him.-. At... the  last moment the agedAbuna&apos;s  hand was only forced by an outbreak, of  ruicontrollableexcitement at the palace,  in  which a considerable  number  of people  were killed.   As it was, a little  more Shoan incompetencemight  have  turned  the bloody  victory near Ankober  into  acrushing defeat.     The Legations at Adis Abeba, whose  communications withcivilization were cut  off for several weeks, made every preparation for a siege; for if the Wollos had reached the capital it is doubt-fal whether Negus Mikhail could have restrained  them from  ageneral massacre of Europeans..  If Lij YasU had been  drownedEmperor, the Abyssiniansr might never have combined againsthint, for  they have the greatest respect for  the Lord&apos;s  Anointed.Fortunately the soothsayers advised him that, if  he was crowned,he would speedily die.                         NOTES.Hejaz  intelligence.     The retirement  of  the  Turkish  advanced  detachments onMedina continues, and,  no doubt, at the same time, other troops are being withdrawn northwards from that city.   On  the 23rdwe were informed that Bir Derwish had been evacuated at last,the Turks retiring on Manjur,  which is some sixteen miles fromMedina.  Emir  Ali  claims to have driven them out after  two days fighting, and  has, at&quot; any rate,  a  Yuzbashi with nine men,237 rides, and much gun and rifle ammunition to show for his claim.     Raids on the railway are  continuing.  On the 22nd newscame that one of Emir  feisal&apos;s detachments bad blown  up threeculverts and  destroyed a long stretch of permanent way, a fewmiles south  of  El-Ala station.  The  raiders remained  twelvehours  near  the  rails, but were not interfered with a fact that possibly indicates  that the line is now so much  cut  up  thatcommunication  along the southern  section  of it  has  virtuallystopped.Ibn SaiicCs &apos; Movement North.     A certain  Mohammed ibn Fahad,  from  Malham in Aridh,who  left his  home about  February  10,   has  given  some information   to  Basrah about  Ibn   Saud&apos;s  movement towardsQasiin.   According to him,  Ibn  Saud  had concentrated in theKhafs  district N.E.  of  Riyadh, and moved north with  elements of the Dawasir,  Sebei, Sahul, Ahl Murrah, Hajir, Qahtan, Khalid,Hawaziin, Ateibah,  and  Arjah  (part of  the Ajman)  tribes,some of  these being settled  folk, some Beduins.   He  had sent
his  brother, Mohammed, ahead to Qasim to raise the levy there.This spring there is plenty  of  fodder and forage everywhere.Near Mejmaa, in  Sedeir, five envoys of Ibn Rashid to the tribesAvere caught (Mejmaa, it  should be remembered,  has  Rashiditesympathies).   According to  this  informant  certain  of  theAteibah are still with  Ibn Saud, one large section, the  Shiyabin,Avho range near Asheirah, 100 miles  from Mecca  on the Qasimroad, being divided in allegiance.Aden Hinterland.    Aden  information up to March 9 tells us that,  accordingto more than one independent native report, the temporary allies,Mohammed Nasir Muqbil and Ahmed Naaman ,  (presuming thatthe latter is meant by &quot; Seyyid Ahmed Pasha  of  Taiz &quot;) havefallen out,  owing to  an  attempt  on the former&apos;s life  by thelatter&apos;s  men.   Both  appear  to have appealed  to Lahej,  andMohammed has  recalled  about one  hundred of his  own  menfrom that  place to his  assistance.   The Subeihi are out on theLahej-Qatabah route  near  Nubat  Dakim  and  have looted  acara\&apos;an.
