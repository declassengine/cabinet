SECRET.79APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT  No.  V.                                   MESOPOTAMIA.     ALTHOUGH there is no reference to the matter in this report, the military news from Kut is of far-reaching political importance.     The blow to Turkish  power in  Irak  extends our influence into the interior far beyond the  actual localities occupied by our troops.     It is possible, if the  Turks are really demoralised, that the Tigris and Euphrates- nomads, north of Baghdad, may rise against  them, and that a  collapse of Turkish government  in these parts may be at hand.   We should be well  advised to have in readiness a  considered policy in regard to the Arab  population.     Hitherto we have had  only to deal with the anarchist  and bastard tribes of the delta and the marshes.  Should the Turks, owing to causes not directly arising out of our operations, be unable  to remain in  Baghdad, we shall come in contact with Arab elements hitherto not within the scope of our  political officers&apos; activities.     At Baghdad education and social  life generally are at a far higher level than in any place to the south of  it.                                       RUSSIA.     The re-opening of the Duma  will mark a critical period in Russian internal politics.                                      HEJAZ.     The news from  Hejaz is  satisfactory but  needs  no comment,  except that it is particularly  gratifying to find that our airman was well  received  on landing by  the Arabs under Sherif Zeid.   This  marks a considerable step  in the improvement of  our relations with the Arabs ; experienced persons  would  have doubted  the  possibility of such a thing a year ago.                               NORTH MESOPOTAMIA.     The rumour that  the Kurds  are  giving  the Turks trouble iri the vicinity  of Diarbekir may be of importance, as this area is in touch with the Arab movement.                                  TRIPOLITANIA.     The famine in Tripoli is to be  noted as the first news we have had of  this.                                      INDIA.     The official  report of the calm with which  the  responsible Indian Moslems havereceived the news of His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy in regard to Constantinople isof great consequence.   It may be that  the responsible Indian  Moslems imagine that, asthe  British  practically invented or revived  the  Caliphate  of the Ottomans, no people have a better right to decide the fate of the Turkish capital.

                                    RUSSIA.                                    -                      Threatened Strikes and Demonstrations.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed  on the 23rd February [No.  220]  that rumours  ofintended strikes and demonstrations of workmen at the re-opening of the Duma on the27th February had been current for some days past.  The strikes  would  be primarily on account of the shortage of food supplies, and attempts to  pillage provision shopsmight be made, but it was not considered likely that  any serious disorders would takeplace.  The general in command of the  military district of Petrograd had appealed  tothe patriotism and common sense of the working-classes, urging them not to listen  tothe advice  of disaffected and  ill-disposed persons;  his  language was conciliatory, buthe reminded them that Petrograd was under martial law.                                  English Help.     Sir G. Buchanan transmitted on the 22nd February [No.  213] a message from lord milner for the Prime Minister, saying that promises nti d been made to  the RussianGovernment of various kinds of materiel, but it was  difficult to explain the ins and outsby telegram.                                   RUMANIA.                           Food  Conditions in Moldavia.     In regard to Sir G.  Barclay&apos;s telegrams on this matter  [see Eastern Report IV,p. 2], Mr. Balfour telegraphed to  Sir  G. Buchanan on the  20th  February I No. 355],instructing him to request  Lord Milner and  General Wilson  to  discuss it with theRussiaii authorities and to inform him as to the result.     Sir G. Barclay telegraphed  on the 26th February [No.  L07] that the position wasvery serious; according  to  the statistics compiled by the War  Department, there wasonly sufficient  wheat to  feed  the  armies and  the  wheat-rationed  portion  of the civilian population till the beginning of April.                               The Eaihvay Question.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on  the 23rd February  [No. 222] that there had been aconsultation on the  danger caused by the continued  chaos on  the Rumanian railways in which Sir N. Griffiths, Mr. Bury, the military attache, and Major Neilson took part,the last named having just  returned from Rumania.   They came to the  conclusion thatthe only possible  solution  was  to hand over the  management of the railways to acapable  Russian.   Sir G.   Buchanan gathered that the Rumanians  would  prefer anEnglishman, but it would take weeks to get one out and the crisis called for immediate action.  Mr. Bury (who is  engaged on the general organisation of Russian railways)suggested M. von Mekk, manager of the Moscow line.  The Minister for Foreign affairs had, in the course of conversation with the French and Italian Ambassadors and Sir G.Buchanan, called attention to the subject and hod  said that the  situation was acute andmust be relieved ; there  was to be  a meeting on  the following  day (24th  February)  ofthe four  first mentioned, Generals Gourko and Berthelot, and Sir N. Griffiths.   Sir G.Buchanan asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would raise any objection to Russiataking over the railways, which  seemed the  only hope of saving the situation.     Sir  G.  Buchanan telegraphed again on  the 25th February [No. 226] saying thatthe meeting had been held  and the matter discussed at length but without any definiteresults ;  General  Gourko was  unfortunately unable to attend but the military attachewas to discuss the whole question with him on the 26th  February.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the  26th February [No. 230] that the military attache had seen  General  Gourko, who said that Russia could not spare men to takeover the railways; he should welcome the appointment of a British engineer as assistantto the Rumanian Director of Railways, and would telegraph to  the Ptumanian Chief ofthe Staff to see if he had  any objection.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs told Sir G.Buchanan that he quite approved of  the proposed appointment.   Mr. Bury stronglyrecommended the appointment of Mr. Fellowes, general superintendent  of the MidlandRailway.
                        Insanitary Condition of the Army.    Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 22nd February [No. 101] that Professor Canta-cuzene, an  eminent  Rumanian army doctor, had  informed  him  that  the  sanitarycondition of the army was deplorable, and that hundreds were dying daily from coldand hunger, and that  he (Cantacuzene) had recommended that invalids and convalescentsshould be evacuated to Russia; his recommendation had been adopted in principle, butRussian co-operation was needed.                             Evacuation of the Army.    Sir G. Buchanan  telegraphed on the  26th  February [No. 230] that  the Minister ofForeign Affairs had informed him that General Gourko had expressed himself in favourof the evacuation of the greater part of the Rumanian army.                                    EGYPT                              Refugees from Ruad.    Sir R.  Wingate  telegraphed  on the 24th February [No. 191] that the  french authorities might perhaps wish to remove about 1,300 persons of the civil population ofRuad, and the French representatives had asked whether  they could be accomodated in Egypt.   He said that the local authorities  had  expressed a  strong opinion against any further additions to the refugees  at  present in Egypt : refugees had been  a source of considerable difficulty and expense.   Sir R. Wingate shared the objection of the localauthorities, and the military authorities agreed that it was most undesirable to accede to the French  wishes.   Mr. Balfour telegraphed  to Lord Bertie  that  if the  FrenchGovernment  should raise the  question he should  say that he  (Mr. Balfour)  entirelyshared Sir B. Wingate&apos;s view.                                The Arab  Bureau,    The Report for January mentions that the Yemen  handbook  has  at length  beenissued ; in. preparing the outline map which accompanied  the handbook use was madeof a manuscript staff  map, taken  from a Turkish officer made prisoner in Hejaz, which appears more reliable  than any previous staff maps  in the possession of the Bureau, andis being reproduced by the Survey Department.  Mention is also made of the receipt ofthe proofs of the second edition of the  Hejaz handbook : the first edition is so incom-plete  that the second  will be published with as little delay as possible.                                  ABYSSINIA.              French Demand for a Prolongation of the Jibuti Railway.     Mr. Tbesiger telegraphed  on the 19th February [No. 13A] that, contrary to the tripartite agreement, the French Legation had asked for a prolongation of the railwaywestward, the present terminus being at Akati, 8 miles E.S.E. of Adis Abeba.                                TRIPOLIT AN 1 A.                                     Famine.     The famine is becoming acute, particularly in the Jebel;  the population is sufferinggreat misery and there is much disease.                 TURKEY-IN-EUROPE  AND  ASIA  MINOR.                              The Shaykh-ul-Islam.    Information has been received from a reliable source that the Shaykh-ul-Islam hasbeen appointed Minister of Wakfs, presumably at Constantinople.                              Attempt on Castelorizo.    Towards the end of January the Turks from the mainland attempted to land on the island of Castelorizo, but failed completely, six out of ten boats being sunk.

                                 .  Rifaat Pasha.     In Eastern Report  IV, at p. 2, it was mentioned  that an agent had reported therecall of Rifaat Pasha to  Constantinople.   It is now reported that he left St. Moritz en route for Constantinople,  but changed his mind and is now at Geneva.  The reason givenfor this being disappointment at not being given the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.                                    ARABIA.ENEMY PORTS  ON THE RED SEA LITTORAL.     The Resident at Aden  and the Governor  of Bombay have both  urged, in view ofthe  existence  of considerable illicit traffic between  Jihuti and enemy ports on the arabian littoral, the desirability of extending to Jibuti, the restrictions at present in forcein 1&apos;espect of goods consigned from India to Italian ports on the Red Sea.HEJAZ.                                    Operations.     Sir R.  Wingate telegraphed on the  21st  February [A.B. 807] that on the  19thFebruary an aeroplane had  landed on the new forward  landing ground  at  Abbud, andthe pilot had been very well  received by Sherif Zeid and the Arabs.  Reliable information had  been received that on the 20th February a train  going south was blown up on the hejaz railway between Muderrij and Towira : wagons of military stores were  destroyed and  the train was derailed, but the engine  got away.     Telegraphing  again  on the  28th  February [A.B.  820], he  said that on  the 22ndFebruary an aeruplane reconnaissance had reported that the Turkish camp at Sath-ul-Ghayir and  Khunigat-ar-Rim, in  the same  region, had apparently been evacuated.                        Rifles and Guns  for King Hussain.     The War  Office telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate on the 21st February informing him  that arrangements were being made for the  supply of 30,000 rifles, partly by theEnglish Headquarters in  Egypt and  partly by the Egyptian army.  As regards mountainguns, it would not be possible at  present to supply more than the two batteries alreadymen tioned.                     The Application for French Moslem Doctors.     In regard to the application for  French Moslem doctors [Eastern Report, IV, p. 5],Mr.  Balfour, on the 23rd February, wrote  to the French Ambassador, saying  that HisMajesty&apos;s Government felt  some surprise at the request, as it appeared  to be in directcontradiction with  his frequently expressed desire to avoid all foreign  interference inHejaz,  and  it was  strongly of opinion that the assistance afforded to  King Hussainshould  be limited to his essential military and political  requirements.  It would  be undesirable  to furnish any grounds for suspicion in the Moslem world that Hejaz had fallen under Christian influence.  The  predominant interests of Great Britaiirin Hejazhad  been freely recognised by the French Government, and His Majesty&apos;s Governmenttrusted that it would share  its opinion that the proposal to introduce foreign doctors, orany other of a similar character,  was calculated  to create the suspicion indicated above,and he hoped  that Colonel  Bremond might be instructed to discourage the idea, and to induce King Hussain to  abandon it.   The draft of this  conimunicjition was submited toand approved by  Mr. Chamberlain, who had expressed the misgiving with  which  he regarded French policy in Hejaz.                         The Question of  a Bank at Jeddah.     In reply  to a request from Mr. Chamberlain for a statement of the views of theGovernment of India, the Viceroy telegraphed on the 16th February that it consideredthe proper policy  to be :  (1) elimination of  French  claims,  and (2) the  eventualestablishment  of a purely British bank  with Indian connections in the interest of thepilgrim traffic and Indian trade.  To this end King Hussain should be induced to closedown the Ottoman bank, which should not be resuscitated in any form.  If the FrenchGovernment would withdraw its claim a British bank might be established at once;  if notthe Indian Government saw no object in  attempting to secure a footing through the thin
disguise of a trading firm such as Cowasjee Dinsba and  Co., as had been suggested the best course in that eventjwould be to get King Hussain to refuse to allow any bankingfor the present.   If, however, it should be decided to employ  Cowasjee Dinsha it shouldbe clearly laid down that the arrangement was a temporary one and gave them no  claimto a subsequent banking monopoly.  In  transmitting a copy of this telegram to theForeign Office on the 22nd February, Sir A. Hirtzel, on behalf of Mr.  Chamberlain,endorsed the views contained therein.  He said that Mr. Chamberlain would prefer theNational Bank of India, or the Eastern Bank to Messrs. Cowasjee Dinsha, but if Frenchsusceptibilities should preclude the opening of  a British bank he would suggest that negotiations should at once be opened with that firm  since he did not feel sure,  in viewof recent incidents, that  the  King would  be able to resist the pressure of the French ifthey seriously wished to introduce a bank of their own, if nobody was already in thefield.ASIR.                             Idrisi and King Hussain.    The Resident at Aden telegraphed  on the  25th  February [No.  328 A.P.] to  Cairosaying that Idrisi  agreed to the suggested visit of Mustapha [Eastern Report IV,  p. 5],but wished  to  see  him  first;   The  Resident  asked Sir  R.  Wingate  to  arrangeaccoroingiy.ADEN.                                Observation Balloon.    The Resident telegraphed on the 26th February that a kite balloon had been  flyingfor some days, and that the observations promised good results.                                     SYRIA.                            The French Legion d&apos;&apos;Orient.     The  C.I.G.S. telegraphed to the  G.O.C.-in-C. in  Egypt on the 22nd Februaryinforming  him  that,  although  the  Foreign  Office had approved in  principle  the recruitment by the French of Syrian volunteers in Egypt other than prisoners of war[telegram No. 39 to Sir R. Wingate, 16th  January], the French Ambassador was  beinginformed that the British authorities had  the  first claim  on  such Syrian recruits :  thedirector of recruiting required for the British service all  available recruits not prisonersof war.   Volunteers from among the Turkish prisoners of war of Syrian origin  mightbe  recruited for  the legion.    In regard to this  Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed to Sir  R.Wiugate  on  the  24th  February [No. 188J saying that he  had  warned the french ambassador that  there wordd be but little  surplus  after our own  requirements hadbeen met.                                 Shortage of Food.     Shortage of  food appears  to be  general in the district south of Horns, and  to beaffecting the troops as well as civilians.                             NORTH  MESOPOTAMIA.                                  Revolt of Troops.     A reliable agent says that  Jemal Pasha left for Diabeker on the 9th February.  Itw7as said that the Kurdish troops there had  revolted, and that this was causing theGovernment uneasiness.                                     PERSIA.                             The Financial Commission.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed from  Petrograd  on the  22nd  February [No. 216]in  regard to Sir C. Marling&apos;s telegram  No.  59 [Eastern Report  IV, p.  6] that theRussian Government considered that it would be illtimed to  insist  on  the  immediaterecognition of  the  arrangement  in connexion  with ^che  Financial Commission  ofControl.   Mr. Balfour had already informed Sir  C.  Marling of  his concurrence in thisview.   [Ibid.]
                                  German Agents.     Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the  21st  February [No. 76] that it appeared from German correspondence, as reported  by Sir  P. Sykes, that Captain Niedermayer had escaped from Afghanistan, and was now active in Kermanshah.                             Ashabad-Meshed Railway,     In replying to an inquiry made by Mr. Chamberlain on the  16th January, the &quot;Viceroy telegraphed on the 22nd February that the Indian Government (which had always regarded  as inevitable  a Russian railway extension towards Meshed) thought that the position should be accepted provided that nothing was done to upset relations with Afghanistan,  and that Russia  agreed to  adopt  a  reciprocal friendly attitude towards our enterprise in the South.   In regard  to the  first  of these conditions, the Indian Government (having in mind the excitement recently caused  in Afghanistan by the  military  activity   on  the  N.W.  frontier.)  would  deprecate  work  being started till after the war.  The Amir had guaranteed neutrality so long as his  country was not threatened ; but  he might be seriously embarrassed by a new railway, as  the war party would certainly try to  interpret it as a threat.                             Astara-Teheran Railway.     Sir C.  Marling telegraphed  on  the 19th February  [No. 72]  that  the Russian Government  had informed its  Minister at  Teheran that the Societe&quot;  d&apos;Etude was prepared  to see  an application made for an Astara-Teheran railway.   The Russian Minister had been instructed to invite Sir C. Marling to ask for instructions ;  and, in the event of the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the French Minister was  to be invited to join in an application for a concession.  It  was to  be  understood that, in regard to the section of the consortium railway within our sphere, a similar  procedure would be followed.                   Telegraph Line from Bunder-Abbas to Kerman.     The Viceroy telegraphed on the  21st February that 95 miles of the line had been completed : all possible measures to accelerate the construction were being taken, and the slow progress was due to the difficulty of negotiating the rocky mountain range, to the inclement  weather, and to sickness.                        The Yar Muhammad Zai Damanis.     The Viceroy telegraphed on the 21st February that a settlement had been completed by the surrender  of all rifles demanded as a fine.                         INDIA AND AFGHANISTAN.                                 General Situation.     The Viceroy  telegraphed on the 26th February that there was no change to reportin the general military  situation.                            Moslems and Constantinople.     It is officially reported  that responsible  Mohammedans in India have received the news of the probable fate  of Constantinople with indifference, and that there is no reason for anticipating  any popular excitement when it becomes generally known.PRINTED AT THE POKEIGN OVVICE BY C.

ARABIA.                          Hejaz.                   The  Political Situation.     Fakhri Pasha&apos;s withdrawal towards Medina from the Yamboand  Rabugh roads may mark the end of the second stage of the hejaz Revolt.  In any case,  since eight months have  elapsedfrom the  day on which the  Emir of  Mecca  declared hisindependence, it is time to take  stock of  his  actual position inrelation to those whom he called upon then to support him.(a). Tribes.     It has been  pointed out more  than once that,  first andforemost he relies, and must rely, on tribal loyalty.  Ever since his appointment to the Emirate in  1910, he has worked to makehimself and his sons Bedouin chiefs.   Unsupported by the tribes,he would be no better  than a make-believe sovereign.     What then is his Bedouin following ?  It has  been, andis still  drawn mainly from two of the most numerous tribes inArabia, the Harb and the Ateibah, and from one tribe of inferiorrank,  the Juheinah.   These three  occupy  a great block of territory, which   amounts  to  about three-quarters  of Hejazproper, together with a slice of western Nejd.   South and east of this block, but within the limits  of  Hejaz, lie  half-a-dozensmall tribes,  among  whom  we have heard  of  the Hudheil,the  Beni Saad, the  Buqum,  the  Muteir,  and, doubtfully, theThaqif, fighting for  the  Emir, but not the most  numerous ofthe  group,  the Juhadlah.  South . of these again,  in a regionusually reckoned  to  be Asir,  but  claimed as his  by  the Emir,is a group of much stronger tribes  whose adhesion means thedisposal  of stouter  fighting  material than the tribes of Hejazsupply.   Of these, all  those lying  nearest to the  Hejaz border,viz., the  Dhawi Hasan, the Ghamid, the Zahran and the Shahran,have been reported loyal to the Emir, and the last two tribes,  atany rate,  have given earnest of such  sentiments  by  sendingcontingents which are in the field at this moment.  The Bishawa,who are  of the  Shahran, are  the  most  reliable  of the  Emir&apos;s immediate adherents,  form the nucleus  of  his standing  force,and serve as his police.     From the country  north of the central  group, the Emirhas  been able to draw on  three, at  least, of  the small southernAnazeh  tribes, the  Aida, the  Fuqara  (Fejr), and  the  WuldSuleiman.  The Billi,  the tribal  block immediately north of theJuheinah between the sea and the  railway, offered  help somemonths ago, and, on January 25  last, when Wejh had fallen, came in as one  man to be enrolled.  They were followed by some sectionsof the  Atiyah and Huweitat.   Finally the Emir has received pro-mises of adhesion from important tribes still further north ; fromthe great Anazeh group of the Ruwalla, who more perhaps, than any other Bedouin tribe move  as one  man under the leadership  of
 the Shaalan house ; from both main sections, eastern and western of the Huweitat, under Audah Abu Tayyi and Shadli Alyan ; from that major part of the Beni Sakhr, which follows Fawwaz el-Faiz, and from  the Kerak Arabs, under the  Majali  house.   These northerners,  however, are allies only in posse and under  certain conditions and eventualities.  None of  the Sherarat  groups  has offered  adhesion.   The  Huteim  have appeared, as  usual, as mercenaries and freebooters on both sides.     To return  to  the tribal elements, which have actually been, and are,  in  the field.   Though  the  rooted  habit  of most Bedouin tribes or clans, and especially of the Heja2 Bedouins, is to  fight only in their  own  territories (except when raiding a neighbour&quot;), some of the  Emir&apos;s contingents  have consistently served far from their homes, for example, the Ateibah, at Medina, Rabugh and Wejh, and the Hudheil at Yambo.  For the Wejh expedition Feisal uprooted the whole tribe of the Juheinah,  and carried  them into the heart of the Billi country.  Secondly, tribes- men have been  serving with, and among their  blood-enemies, as for instance,  Ateibah with Harb,  and  Fuqara with Juheinah. Thirdly, contrary to their immemorial habit, the same tribes  and clans have already kept the field through a summer and autumn and most of a winter.  Foiu&apos;thly, wherever the Turks,have tried to operate, they have invariably found the  local clans up  against them ;  nor have they been  able, by every  resource of terror or gold,  to produce any but very  partial and  short-lived tribal defections.   Fifthly,  we have never yet heard  of  any  Hejaz tribe or clan  within the  area of active operations,  coming out as a whole, or even in any proportion, on behalf of  the Turks.  The only  Arab of note with  them  is Dakhil  Allah el-Kadhi,  a Juheinah adventurer, with half-a-dozen followers.    The part  played by the sections and  clans of the Harb  will illustrate  these observations.  If we leave  out of account  the re- duction of the southern townSj active operations in the course of the revolt have virtually been  confined to Harb territory.   At  the beginning, when Sherifs Ali and Feisal were besetting Medina, they had a mixed force of Ateibah and Harb, the last drawn chiefly fromthe Auf  section which  is local.   No  defection  has yet beenreported from this section except  that of the Beni  Ali cultivatorsof Awali, who gained nothing by it but gross maltreatment fromthe Turks.  When Ali fell back on to the  Rabugh roads  late inJuly,  the Beni Salim  and Beni  Amr sections of  the Harb joinedhim, just about the same time as the Juheinah&apos;joined Feisal whenhe fell back into the Wadi Yambo.  The clans of the Beni Salim, which we  heard of first as taking an active part for the Emir wehear of  still the Ahamda, the Subh, the Hawazim, the Rahalah,Radadah,  Wuld  Mohammed,  Sumeidat, Dawahir, etc.   Therehave been  temporary defections of groups  or sheikhs from, e.g.,the two first named, which have been proclaimed by  enemyorgans as  defections of the whole : but the fact  is that all theseclans  are still active in the defence of those parts of the Rabugh
and  Yambo  roads which run  through  their hills, and in the cutting of Turkish communications.  The same may be said for theAuf, and the Beni Amr sections.  The Sahliyah, Firidah, Beni Ali,Jahm, Fahdah and Wahab clans have been out for some  time,and, so far as we know,  all are still in the field.   Reports whichwe bave received from sure sources concerning the inability of theTurks in Medina to  learn what is -ffoing; on  a few miles to theeast  of them, as well  as the fate which  has  befallen caravans onthe last  stages of the roads from Hail  and Qasim, attest the solidarity of the Harb in that quarter.     What was said, therefore, by T.E.L. (in our No. 32, p.  483)about  the political attitude of the tribes is  borne out sufficientlyby the facts.   Wherever there  have been  active operations theBedouins have come out when  and where required and have keptout,  and no tribe or clan  in those areas has  operated against the emir. Even the least well affected of the Harb, the Zobeid section,is not to be cited as a  proved exception.  The only operationswithin  its territory  so far haATe been  these  against  Jiddah,in which Zobeid Harb took part.  Since  then, under the maligninfluence of their paramount chief, Husein  Mubeirik (who, fromself   interest,  has actually joined  the  Turks) and  probablymistrustful of the spectacle offered by the Babugh camp with itsnumerous foreign tenants, many of  them have stood aloof,  with-drawing twenty miles inland to Hajah and elsewhere ; but neitherthe section as a whole nor any one  clan of it has been  heard of on the enemy side.     Accordingly the Emir&apos;s pretention to be the accepted leader of the tribal  population of Hejaz  proper may fairly  be saidto have been justified from the first, and to be so still.   We arenot here concerned with  the means, pecuniary or other, by which its allegiance has been  gained and  maintained,  any  more than with its military value.   We have merely to record the fact that atpresent the Kingj of  the Hejaz has the political support of  thesetribes, and that their support is, perhaps, as nearly  unanimousas that accorded to  any other  Sovereign  by an equally  largeproportion of his subjects.   They have kept a fighting strengthof about 30,000 volunteers  in  the  field.  The  King&apos;s  possiblerelation to tribes outside the Hejaz is a matter for  separate and subsequent consideration.(b).    Townsmen.     The attitude of the townsmen  is  of course governed byentirely  different  considerations  to  those  which influence the tribesmen, and has been  less steadily loyal.     On the  outbreak of the  revolt, Mecca and Jiddah  were pratically unanimous in supporting  the  Sherif.   They  wereshort  of  food, trade was  at  a standstill, pilgrim traffic was entirely  suspended, and  with  it the means  of livelihood of thevast majority of the people.     But when the first enthusiasm  of revolt had subsided andthe townsmen began to take stock of the situation many of  them
saw. signs; of danger  and  uncertainty in  the future, and their loyalty was tempered accordingly.   They began to doubt how far it  was possible that the Sherif could  establish  any permanentindependence; many  of  the  leading families  dependent  onTurkish  pensions, doubted  how  long  the , Sherif  could go onpaying them, now that  the  Turks had  gone ;  others feared thatthe Sherifs - military power, exhausted in ; fighting the  Turks,might soon  be insufficient to protect them  from tribal, raids andforays; others again. calculated the situation  that  might followupon the death or murder of the Sherif, and the internal inter-family feuds that  might disturb  Mecca in  consequence of rivalclaims to the Emirate.  To these  must be added an  emotioncommon probably to all in varying degrees,  namely, a half-conscious regret  in  assisting at what might be a fatal  blow  tothe unity of  Moslem   power  so long represented  before theworld by Turkey.     ,                                .   -     Such anxieties  have  been responsible for: a good deal  of anti-Sherifian if not  actually pro-Turkish, feeling in the towns.The Sherif, however, has played with great  skill upon the minds of  the  people  and  has so far overcome  these difficulties, thatgradually the people  of Mecca  are returning  to their earlyenthusiasm for the Sherifs cause.  .     The  Sherif  has  constantly  laid  bare intrigues and plotsagainst him, but  has so far  taken no public  action  in regard  toany of them.   The people  of Mecca,  who have  always  stood  inthe deepest  awe of him, believed that once he had obtained fullpower, he would  cease to be the clement and generous ruler thathe had been when the Turks  were supreme, and  would follow the principles of oppression, tyranny  and exaction, inevitablyassociated in oriental minds with the  possession of power. :     They  have  been  immensely  and  agreeably impressed byobserving that the Sherif has not acted in  this  manner.  It - isthe avowed  policy of the Sherif to win  the people over to himself and to his cause by  moderation.  He is said to know  all thosewho are working against him, and recently gave dramatic proof of this in the case of the well-known Sheikh  Zawawi,  who hadbeen  carrying on a  dangerous  intrigue against the Sherif, andwho was summoned to his presence a few weeks ago.   Since the interview he  has gone  about  Mecca doing propaganda for theSherif instead of against him.   The Sherif intends to  pursue this policy unless military reverses  make it essential to deal moredrastically.   Should the situation ever demand it, so he informed the writer, all those  who are known to  be hostile to him, and  tohave  continued their intrigues, will be hanged out of hand andwithout hesitation.     There  is no doubt whatever that the Sherifs policy  hasbeen  amply justified so far, for whilst  a few months  ago  fiftyper cent, of the Meccans were hostile to the Sherif, some seventy-five per cent, of the population are now entirely on his side.     The  situation  at  Taif is not  so clear, but  is  probably
not  quite  so satisfactory as that  of  Mecca.   There is  some difficulty in getting any detailed information  on the subject,  asthose, of the Sherif s entourage with whom we have had contactseem to know very little of the  feeling of the  people at  Taif.They merely say that they are confident that the  Grand  Sherifis fully acquainted with: all that goes  on in  Taif,  and can  be counted upon to  keep  the  situation in hand.  The presence  of.some 3,000 Turks  at  Ebhah,  however, and the  facilities  that must exist for corresponding with their agents in  Taif, make it probable that there is much anti-Sherifian  intrigue in that town.The Sherif stated that  he intended  to go to  Taif  as usual thishot weather,  and indeed, invited Wilson Pasha and the writer  to accompany him  there.   His presence in  Taif  should do much  toimprove the feeling of  the townsfolk.     As regards Jiddah, there is little to be  said.   The popu-lation is so varied consisting of the mixed products of many ageneration&apos;s pilgrimage that no Arab feeling as such can be said to exist.  Jiddah, even more than Mecca, lives solely on the pilgrim-age, and its policy and  its  sentiments are entirely  influenced  bymaterial considerations  dependent upon  it.  The Jiddawa would,in  many  respects,  prefer  a  British occupation  to  any  othersolution of the present  situation, and in their  hearts believe in  itsadvent.   They  have no loyalty for the  Sherif, and showed verylittle interest, and no enthusiasm, on the recent occasion of  his visit.  Active hostile intrigue  is at a  discount at  the presentmoment owing  to the presence of  Sherif Muhsin as  Governor.The heavy hand of this official has  some considerable  reputationin an  area that  includes, but also goes far beyond, the boundaries of  Jiddah.   Sherif MuhshPs  personal courage  and  completedevotion to the  Sherif, together with his hatred  of the Turks,makes him  an entirely  desirable  and  suitable appointment inJiddah,  and, so  long  as  he is there, a tranquility  amountingalmost to paralysis may be  counted  upon.(c). Foreign  Affairs.     In  the   matter  of external relations it is unnecessary todiscuss princes or  powers outside the Arab area.   As regardsthese, the  King of the  Hejaz  claims, in all sincerity, that he hasthe same friends and the same enemies  as ourselves,  and in thesame  measure.    Within the  Arab area, however, his foreign relations cannot be dismissed so simply.   It has been stated above which greater chiefs of the northern Arabs have offered adhesionto his cause.   There is reason to think that  list not exhaustive.Others, e.g. Anazeb chiefs, like the great sheikhs of the Fedaan,  are equally friendly, and will be ready to co-operate with the King incertain eventualities;  but  his  immediate  neighbours,  Idrision  the  south  and Ibn  Saud on  the east, are  less  cordiallyinclined,  and  their respective religious positions, which  causeeach  to be  regarded  in  Mecca  as a schismatic, hinder thegrowth  of better relations.    The Kunfida affair  only addedresentment and  public justification to Idrisi&apos;s deep-seated jealousy,/
 and undoubtedly it is dislike and  ear of the Turks and their ally, the Imam Yahya, coupled  with uneasiness about  our attitude, that alone induces Idrisi to keep up even an appearance of amity with the  King of  the  Hejaz.   Ibn  Saud,  too, nurses  old grievances concerning the allegiance of the Ateibah and of Qasim and the protection of his rebellious  kinsmen the Araif, but values too highly his good relations with ourselves,  and possibly also the financial resources of which the King of the  Hejaz disposes, to break the peace.  He has written (under suggestion) friendly letters to  the latter,  but  has neither addressed him by his new title nor  sent any  contingent  to  his  forces.  Ibn Saud&apos;s two chief allies,  the  Sheikhs of Kuweit and  Muhammerah, having had no  personal  quarrels  in the past with  Emir Husein,  are more frankly amenable to our policy in  regard to  the King  of the Hejaz ; but no more than Ibn  Saud  do  they yet concede to him,  in  correspondence,  the style and  title of  a  king.   With Ibn Rashid, the Emir  at  one  time hoped  to come  to terms, but that hope has  died with the  former&apos;s  open acceptance  of Turkish allies and provision of  assistance to  the  Turkish forces in Hejaz ; and Sherifs  Abdullah and Feisal have declared their intention of dealing faithfully with  Ibn  Rashid  as an irreconcilable- cileable foe once they have done with Turks.   Finally, the Imam Yahya is not personally hostile to the  King  of  Hejaz,  while his greatest vassal, Nasir Mabkhut of the  Hashid, is  inclined to  be friendly ; but neither is free at present to adopt a foreign policy contrary to that of the Turks.     Certainly  at the present  moment  the  prospect  of Arabiaunited under either the King of the Hejaz or anyone  else seemsvery remote.   The &quot; Arab Cause &quot; is  evidently  a very  weakcement in  the peninsula ;  dislike  of the Turk is stronger, anda desire to stand well with us is  perhaps  stronger still.  Shouldthe Turk disappear, it  is the last bond  which  will have to takethe strain.                 The  Arab  Advance  on Wejh.     When  the deadlock  in  the Medina Hamra area declareditself in October, 1916, the new idea of an attack  on  the Turkishrear at El-Ala, by  way  of  Wejh,  was brought  forward.   Thesituation in the South  was  that the Turks  held  Medina  too strongly for direct attack  by the Arab  forces, and  that Feisalheld the Kheif Milif  hills too strongly for  direct attack by  theTurkish forces.  In  the rear, almost  blockaded in Rabugh,  laySidi Ali profitlessly with  his army.     Feisal decided to carry out the northern expedition to Wejh,and  to do  it  himself.   He, therefore, brought  up  Sidi  Zeidto Wadi Safra,  and transferred  to  him the whole of  his  Harbforces and his Southern Juheinah.  He then withdrew to WadiYambo to organize a force of Northern Juheinah for the marchon Wejh.
    While  he was  in Wadi &apos; Yambo  in early  December  theunexpected happened.   The Arabs under  Sidi Zeid became slackand left a by-road near Khalis unguarded.  A Turkish mountedinfantry patrol pushed  up along it  into Wadi Safra near Kheif.The front line  of  Arabs, hearing  news  of this  enemy  sixmiles in their rear, broke with a rush to rescue their families and property in  the threatened villages.   Zeid&apos;s main  body followedsuit.  Zeid himself fled at top pace to Yambo ;  and the astonishedTurks occupied Hamra and Bir Said unopposed.    This situation made Feisal&apos;s march  north impossible.  Hemoved  into  Nakhl  Mubarak  with  his  forces  and  the still-trembling remnant of Zeid&apos;s army, and after a few excited daysfought a long range action against  a strong Turkish reconnais-sance.   In this he found his  troops  lacking  in many respects :his centre and right wing held  and repulsed the enemy ;  the left wing (Juheinah) retired suddenly behind  his  centre,  withouthostile pressure.   He suspected treachery and ordered a generalretreat on Yambo, the  next water  supply.  The defaulting  leftwing refused to retire, put up  an independent  stubborn resistanceagainst  the Turks  for  another  twenty-four  hours,  and thenrejoined  Feisal  at Yambo.   It  explained  that  the retirementduring the action was  to find  an opportunity for  brewing a  cupof coffee undisturbed.     The  army of  Sidi Ali at Rabugh  was stirred into life bythese events  and began a sudden advance  of its own towardsBir ibn Hassani, in spite of Feisal&apos;s appeals that  it  should waittill he was  in a  position to support it by a thrust from Yambo.Ali persisted  in  his movement,  and Feisal eventually collectedwhat  men  he could and hurried  out to Nakhl  Mubarak again.He was preparing  a  stroke against Kheif and  Hamra  tosynchronise with  Ali&apos;s arrival  at  Bir ibn  Hassani when he gotnews  that  Ali&apos;s  forces had fallen back sixty miles on hearing a(false)  report  of the  defection  of  the  Subh.   He, therefore,retired again,  in a very bad temper, to Nakhl Mubarak.     The move on Wejh now appeared not merely the convincingmeans of securing a siege of Medina, but an urgent necessity ifa  Turkish  advance  on Mecca was  to be  prevented.   ColonelWilson came  up  to Yambo  and pressed  the  point  on  SherifFeisal, who agreed entirely, but  pointed  out  that  the  Rabughforce  had  proved hollow, and that  the  Turks in  Hamra were open  to strike at Rabugh or Yambo as they pleased.  Now  thatZeid was discredited, and Ali  shown a broken reed, he could notrisk leaving the  area  himself.  In the circumstances ColonelWilson gave Feisal his personal assurance that the Rabugh garrison(with  British  naval help) would  be capable of  resisting  anyTurkish attack until  Feisal had occupied Wejh.   There was nomeans of giving force to this assurance, but it seemed a reasonable and necessary risk to take, since without it Feisal would not have moved north.   Colonel Wilson strengthened his  position  a  fewdays later, by sending  Feisal  direct  orders  from  the Sherif ofMecca to proceed to  Wejh at once.
     The other Arab factor  in our hands .was  Sherif  Abdullah with an untarnished reputation and a force in  being north-east of Medina, an area of very secondary  military importance.   It was pointed out to Feisal how effective Abdullah might be made if he  was  moved to Wadi  Ais, a natural fortress  about 100. kilometres above Medina on  the railway line.   He would there be astride the Medina Lines  of Communication, and  no Turkish advance  towards  Mecca, Yambo,  or even  Rabugh  would   be possible till he had been dislodged, and  to dislodge  him  troops would have to be withdrawn from Ghayir and Hamra since the coincident  Sinai push  of the E.E.F.  made reinforcements from the north improbable.   Feisal saw the point,  and  sent off Raja ibn Khuluwi at once to Abdullah with the scheme.    In view,  however, of the situation at  Rabugh, it seemed  to Colonel Wilson that  FeisaPs mOve on Wejh  should be under- taken as  soon as possible.   Preparations were, therefore,  made for the start, before a reply had arrived  from , Abdullah.   Feisal was very nervous  during this period.  The operation involved a flank  march of about 200 miles parallel to the Turkish communi- cations, by  an inferior fighting  force, leaving its base (Yambo). entirety undefended, and evacuating its  only  possible  defensive position (Wadi Yambo)  in the face of an  enemy force of nearly divisional strength in Wadi Safra, not thirty miles away  across easy country.  The manoeuvre was only made possible at all by the absolute command of the sea and the ungrudging co-operation in transport of ammunition and supplies afforded Feisal by the S.N.O. Red  Sea  Patrol.   The  situation at Yambo , appeared likely to be so insecure that  all   possible rifles  and ammunition were embarked from the town store-houses before we left.    Sherif  Abdullah  fortunately  fell  in with&apos; the  Wadi Ais scheme, and said he would  arrive there on January 11.  Eeisal, therefore, fixed January 20 as a provisional date for  his  attack on Wejh.   Actually, Abdullah was not able to  reach  Wadi-Aistill January 17, and Feisal  did not reach Wejh till January 25.    The occupation of Wejh is of importance, since it means  aprolongation of the Arab front along the Hejaz railway by rather more than 200 miles, the accession to the  Sherifs  cause of theBilli,  and later of  the Beni Atiyah and  Huweitat.   Its  directmilitary value is that it is the only possible base for operations against El-Ala, which is the vital point of railway communication between Syria and Medina, and a base for the future.    Sherif Abdullah&apos;s occupation of Wadi Ais rendered possible FeisaFs move north to Wejh, and Abdullah&apos;s occupation wasindirectly secured by the.operations at Arish and Rafah.T. E. L.

Or the above force, since the Turkish occupation of Wadi Safrah, only about sixty per cent could be counted on as effective, and some large contingents were cut off from communication with Yambo. They were handed over to Sherif Sharaf, with orders to do what he could to get them together again. A few of the Hawazim and Sheikh Khallaf had surrendered to the Turks, but the remainder (about ninety-six per cent) withdrew into their hills with their rifles, and stood on the defensive waiting orders ; or, if they were on the Turkish L. of C., carried out raids on camel convoys and local posts.

                   FeisaVs Order of March. (i).   Yambo to Urn Lej.     From Owais, Feisal moved to Akhdar (water),.and  thence to Nubt (water), and so to Urn Lej.   He took  five days over the journey, which is one of only eighty miles, and experienced great  difficulty for  lack of  water.   I was not able,  owing  to difficulties of the local situation at Yambo, to  travel this stretch with the army, and  can give no details of the route.     The troops were given six days  rations, and ordered to carry two gallons of  water per man.   The  order of march was that the force was  divided into nine  sections, each  under  a  Sherif or sheikh of importance, and instructed  to march  separately to Um Lej, and concentrate there.    Actually  there  proved to  be  no water at Um Lej, and so Feisal camped at Bir el-Waheidi, five miles north-east of the town.   He reached there on  January 14, and in the next four days was  gradually joined by  his  other contingents,  who settled down at all available water-holes  in the district. (ii).   Um Lej  to Wejh.     The more serious part of the march was that from Um Lej to Wejh.  The best road for camels  is  up the coast,  to  Wadi Dhulm, and  then to Abu Zereibat for water.   The  drawback  to the road is that the  sixty miles between  Semna and Abu Zereibat have no permanent  water.  For  this reason  an interior  road, from  Semna  to  Khuf, Towala  and Abu  Zereibat  is  usually chosen,  as  well-water exists at each station.   Between Yambo and Wejh  there is no single spring of running water,  and the wells depend intimately on the rainfall,  which  for the last three years has been  almost  nil.   In consequence, little water  is any- where obtainable, and the  supply  of  forage presents  serious difficulties.   There is  almost  no grazing (and in any case a worked camel cannot subsist by grazing  alone), and  the price of dried hay has reached unprecedented   prices.   A particular local measure of hay, calculated to be sufficient for a riding camel for one day, now  costs  six  shillings  and eightpence.  Feisal only pays  6 a month camel-hire, and in consequence, all the animals are underfed, and quite a number died along our  march, simply from physical  weakness.  The Arabs care for  them  so far  as possible, and  there is little  sickness among  them   but  their carrying capacity is impaired, and their  number is also limited. For the transport of his  army  of  4,000  camel  corps, and 4,000 infantry  (the army is organized on a  basis of rikab and redif to each camel),  mountain-guns,  machine-guns, and mule mounted- infantry,  Feisal had 380  baggage camels, in all.   He  carried eight days food, thirty-six  hours water, 500 rounds  of  2&apos;95 ammunition and a  small reserve of  S.A.A., over the  100,000 rounds of the machine-gun companies, on these 380 camels.    It will  be  understood from  the above,  that the materialneeds of  an Arab army (even when of the size and complexity
of Feisal&apos;s),  are  much  below that of a  Turkish or  Europeanforce.   Feisal&apos;s mountain-battery, in the hands  of its  Egyptianpersonnel, required 360 camels for its proper transport.   Sincethe Egyptians have been  replaced by  Arabs,  the  battery hasmoved with thirty-two camels for  two-day marches, and on thisexpedition of fourteen days  found less  than  eighty  sufficient.The same quantity  of ammunition was carried in  both cases.     At Bir  el-Waheidi Feisal heard that casual rain-pools had formed at two places on the coast  road, and decided to take thatroad to Abu  Zereibat with his own guard and three other sectionsof  the army.  He ordered  the  rest to  march  by Khuff andTowala.   The local Arabs  (Musa Juheinah) on whom  we hadto rely for  local information and as guides proved most un-reliable.  They were never able to  say what the yield of any wellreally would  be, or where and how far off the wells were.   Thenumbers of Feisal&apos;s armies are much in excess of anything whichtribal warfare has conceived, and the Juheinah being uneducated have no unit  of time  smaller  than  the  day,  or  of  distancelonger than  the  span  and shorter than the  stage  (from sixto sixteen hours march, according  to your wish and camel), and cannot realise a number larger than the digits.   Inter-communi-cation between  units of the  Arab forces is often  hindered bythere being no person in a force who can read and write.  In thecircumstances a great deal of delay, confusion, and actual dangerfor lack of water  and  food occurred on our  march, which wouldhave been obviated  had time allowed of  previous reconnaissance of the route.   The  animals were without food for two and a halfdays, and the army marched  the last  fifty miles on half a gallonof water per man and no food.  This did not  seem in any wayto affect the spirits of the  men, who  trotted  gaily into Wejhsinging songs and  executing  sham charges ; nor  did it  affectin any way  their speed or energy.  Feisal  said, however, that another thirty-six  hours  of  the  same conditions  would  have begun to tell  on them.                                                T. E.  L.&apos;                          Midian.                     The Capture of  Wejh.[Precis and Extracts from a Report by Captain A. N. E.  BRAY,                    18th Bengal Lancers.]     On January 21, 550 Arabs, consisting  of  400  Juheinahunder  Sheikh Salih ibn Shefia, and 150 Bishawa  under SheikhAmr,  who had been  brought from  Yambo and  Um Lej,embarked  at Hassani Island.   They reached Sherm Habban thefollowing  day, and were joined there by the several ships  whichwere sent  to co-operate with the Arab attack.     Suleiman Pasha Rufudah, paramount  Sheikh of  the  Billi,hearing that Feisal was marching up the  coast from Um Lej,
had cleared out of Wejh, leaving Ahmed Tewfik Bey, O.C. AgeylCamelmen,. in charge.   The latter also retired before the morning of the 23rd, leaving  100  Turkish infantry in the town,  andanother 100 Turks in  a position on the high ground about a mileeast of  the  town,  on  the  edge of the escarpment  which fallssuddenly to the inland plain.    The town of Wejh stands at the south-western corner of asmall  coralline plateau, bounded on the west by the sea, on thesouth  by the  wadi, and on the  east by  the inland plain ; theplateau rises gradually to the east, and ends in cliffs along thewadi and the inland plain.   About eight miles  up  the  Wadi, atthe entrance to the  foot-hills, is  a fort, to which  part of theTurkish force had retired before the action  began.    The 550 Arab troops consisted  of inferior material,  whichwas  not fit to accompany Feisal&apos;s  army;  and  they  had  no real leaders.  As events turned out, however, they were  destinedto play the principle r61e, and   considering  all  things,  didextremely well.    The landing began at  7.15 a.m. on the 23rd.   One  of the warships began the action by firing at the  Turkish trenches  onthe eastern scarp at a  range of rather over 2,000 yards.  TheArabs divided themselves into three  groups:   (1) About  100who: realty meant  fighting, and advanced  directly against  theTurkish position on  the eastern  scarp ;  (2)  about 300 whomoved  along the beach  and incontinently  went off to loot  andfight  in the town ; (3) about 100 who sat on the beach  and didnothing during the whole operations.                 -    Group  (1) was divided into two parties :  (a) about twentymen under  the above-mentioned Sheikh  Salih, and  (b) abouteighty men.. The first of these parties advanced at a very sharppace straight towards  the  Turks,  who were in  position about,000 yards away.  &quot; At 1,000 yards they  came under fire,  buttook  no notice,  and  showed  no  excitement.    Indeed, they appeared, but for the  pace they were  walking, to be out  for an ordinary constitutional.  When  within 500 yards they  halted a mount or two  to   see exactly where the fire came from,  andwithout taking advantage of any cover  or extending  to  anyunusual extent wandered on till they eventually halted  in somedead  ground  within  fifty yards  of the  Turks.   Here they remained, firing snap-shots and crouching down again, sufferingno casualties  whatever, but inflicting a  fair number on their opponents.   There  was  no noise or confusion, and the affairmight have been a manoeuvre with  blank.&quot;  The most noticeablefault  was that the Arabs would not watch their flanks, and theirleft was threatened by some difficult  rising ground.  However,the Turks tried the other flank, and five men were seen  creepinground the Arabs&apos; right rear.   Three  Arabs, therefore, detachedthemselves from their companions and, calmly sitting on a smallexposed.bluff, shot the leading Turk  dead, wounded the second,and  drove the  rest  back.  Having seen the danger of hidden
- 68 -aground on their flanks, the Arabs; now built small stone sangars,and five of them remained there as long as the action lasted.    When this part of the ground  was gone over  next day,three dead Turks were found in addition to eight large pools of blood.  The Turks numbered thirty-five to the Arabs twenty,and the Arabs suffered no casualties whatever.    &quot;  Meanwhile,  party (b), about eighty strong, swung roundand engaged the Turks further south.   These men behaved in asimilar manner and remained cool in action till ordered to retireso that the naval guns might shell the Turkish trenches.   Theyretired quietly and extended, walking slowly away and taking.nonotice  of the stray Turkish bullets amongst&apos;them.&quot;    The main Arab force rushed in a compact mass straight forthe town and at once began looting and fighting in a completelydisorganized manner.  The Turks  fought very hard in the townfrom  house to  house, and the Arabs  suffered a fair  numberof casualties.  However, by  the evening, they  had  driven  theremnant of the Turks into a few houses at the extreme southernend of the town.   The night, which was windy and cold, passedwithout  incident.   At 7.45  a.m. on the 24th, a naval landingparty  sent a  detachment of  fifty men and  a  machine-gun tooutflank the Turkish position on the Eastern escarpment, whichwas  badly  exposed  from  the rear.    On  reaching  the  risingground, that had been held the previous day, they found it  hadbeen evacuated,  most of  the  Turks  having  retired  to the  fortin the  hills  leaving a few snipers  in the  plain.   Thisi  wassearched by the machine-gun and further trouble was stopped.    Remarkable practice was made by one of the ships, with an up-ended 4-7 gun,  against the distant fort, at the very long range of about  14,000 yards.   A shell was dropped in the middle ofthe fort at the  third shot.  The Turks did not wait for furtherexperiments of  this  kind, and, when  Feisal  reached the  fortnext day,  he found it completely evacuated.    Meanwhile, fighting proceeded in the town.   By the morning of the 24th some forty Turks had been  taken prisoner.  Thenaval landing-party moved back from the scarp toward the town,and twenty-one of the prisoners were handed over to them,  oneof whom volunteered to go in with a white flag and secure  the surrender of any Turks  still holding out.   However,  when  thiswas clone and the houses were searched, no more Turks were foundalive.   The town was in a state of utter confusion, and had beenransacked from roof to floor.  In the mosque was found a deadTurk  with cartridges, the  bullets of which  had  been cut off atthe top to make them expand.    At 3.30 p.m.,  information was  received  that some Turkswere still holding out, and shooting from a tower on  the  southside of the Wadi.   There also appeared to  be Turks  holdingsome trenches in the vicinity of this tower.   These were shelledaccordingly, and covered  by a machine-gun  party  from  thenorthern bank of the Wadi, while a naval landing party made a
spirited charge up the trenches to  the  tower.  The Turks  were found to have fled.  Hearing the commotion, some of the Arabsin the town began long-range fire  on their  own account,  not without  danger  to  the naval  landing  party.    They  were,however, soon controlled, and this ended the operations.  On thefollowing day, several small parties of Turks  were rounded upby  FeisaFs  army,  which  reached  Wejh  in  the  night  ofJanuary 24 and 25.     The total Turkish losses  were about  110, of which  threeofficers and eighty-two men were taken prisoners.     While a seaplane was up on the morning of  the 23rd, theobserver, Lieutenant Stuart, R.F.C., was mortally wounded.  Hewas the only Britisher killed.  One seaman was wounded.                         NOTES.Nejd  News.    The  following information about Central Arabian  matters,past and present, is based on  notes of a conversation with SherifFeisal.    &quot; About five years ago Ibn Saud began to move the peopleof  Western  Nejd  against the Meccans.  He sent  Seyyids andpreachers among the former, and taught that the people of Meccawrere  kufar  and quite intolerable in such Holy Places.  He wonover to his side (by various arguments) some of the Buqum andSebai, and threatened Taif.  This stirred up the Sherif of Mecca,who took effective counter-measures.   In consequence Saad ibn saud  was sent down to  arrange terms of peace.  By mediationall Wadi Dawasir (to the point  where it becomes Wadi Ranyah)was recognized to  be  Ibn  Saud&apos;s,  and Wadis  Kharmah  andBishah  and  Ranyah were confirmed  to the Sherif.  Ibn  Saudwas recognized as  overlord of all the Kahtan,  and the Sherifas  overlord  of the Ateibah.   The  trouble about  the  Ateibahis  that  they  are  a  Hejaz  stock,  recently moved into Nejd.Geographically they should be Ibn  Saud&apos;s, but by origin andcustom  they are Sherifian.  Two years  ago Ibn Saud again gotactive, and sent agents among the Ateibah and other tribes.  SoSherif Abdullah  went  out  over the whole dira, further  than ever  before  to the East, and  received again the  allegiance ofthe Ateibah.&quot;    Feisal regards Ibn Saud as very powerful, but at home only ;for his forces  are not  organized, and he cannot move abroad ingreat  strength.  1  noticed, as before,  among  the Hejaz Arabs andtheir  leaders strong distrust and dislike of Wahabi principles andsectaries.    Feisal is informed that 300 Turks with two mountain-guns,have  been  put under  Ibn Rashid&apos;s  orders  in  Hail.  They areunpopular, and local disturbances in  Hail  recently  ended in thedeaths of two of them./
     Persistent rumours  are  current  amongst  the Ageyl ofa quarrel between Sheikh  Jabir and Ibn  Saud,  in  which Jabirwas  killed.   The  rumours  originated  apparently  in  JebelShammar.     The  Senha  section of the  Qahtan are wild.   A  cord  isknotted about the necks of young lads, and not removed till theyhave killed a man in battle.&quot;Euphrates  News.    From  I.E.F.  &quot; D &quot;  Summary, December     27,1916.     A.P.O. Khamsieh, has received confirmatory evidence of thestatement of  Dhari ibn Tawalah  to the effect that Ibn Rashidintended to move against the Sherif, and has been delayed owingto the inability of his agent,  Rashid ibn Lailah, who has beenpurchasing supplies in Nejf, to arrange  his. safe  passage  (withthe provisions purchased)  through  the tribes  which lie en route from Nejf to Hail.     A.P.O. Khamsieh, reports on December 9, that,  according tohis information from Samawah, Attiyah abu Gallal, a secular leaderat Nejf, has written to the Samawa tribes urging a Jehad againstthe  Turks  if the  latter  should make  any  advance on  Nejffrom Hillah.     This latter news is similar to our  latest reports regardingthe anti-Turk Jehad from Nasiriyah.     A.P.O. Nasiriyah, has received a letter from  Haji Attiyah, astrongly anti-Turk Sheikh of Nejf,  stating that the  numbers ofthe tribal confederation  gathered in revolt against the Turksamounts to 25,000 men.   This figure is  no doubt  exaggerated,but G-.O.C. 15th Division considers that  a general gathering ofthe tribes round Hillah with offensive intent against the Turks isto be accepted, though he  considers that the tribes have  not yetcommitted themselves.     Sheikh Mohammed Kadhim  Yezdi, the  religious  dignitaryof Nejf has not actually declared a Jihad against the Turks, but is said to have given encouragement to the tribal  rising.     Haji Attiyah sent copies to the A.P.O. for  distribution ofhis appeal to the Nasiriyah tribes,  calling.upon them to avengeHillah.   Haji Attiyah  invites the  British to  advance  on theEuphrates, and join his tribal forces.     This tribal gathering, if once it commits itself  before  thosewho  compose it disperse, should be of value  to  us in attractingTurkish  attention and encouraging  the  Turks to detach on this side issue.
