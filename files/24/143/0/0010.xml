SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED  EASTERN REPORT, No.  X.                                     RUSSIA.     THE course of the revolution now  runs  in an obscure channel.   It would b*interesting and useful to know      1. What is the psychological condition of Moscow.     2. What effect the revolution is having on the religious habits of the people.     3. What is taking place in the Moslem areas.     The declaration of the  independence of Poland and Finland should be  noted; it willhave its effect in America.                                     ARABIA.     The news  from Hejaz is promising; the indications are favourable to a spread ofthe movement towards the north.                                     PERSIA.     Much trouble is to be anticipated in Persia.   The extremist revolutionary forces inRussia will support  any form of Persian revolutionarism with which they are  in  close touch.   The tendency will be to  stimulate anarchy  in Persia, agents from Petrogradand  the  Caucasus will find their way to Persia, and in event of there being a distinctsplit in Russia between the forces of the&apos;Provisional Government  and the extremists,the latter will use Persia as an asylum.

RUSSIA.                                 General Conditions.     1. The Army. The Military Attache  at  Petrograd on  the 30th and 31st Marchand  the 2nd  April [Petrograd telegrams  Nos. 424, 434,  and 450], telegraphed that(1) The men  of the Petrograd garrison still mistrusted their officers.  The grenadierbattalion had  only fifteen cfficers  out of seventy ;  the first  railway  regiment woundedits commander, so  Kerniloff determined  to  disband it  and form a  working battalionunder the Ministry of  Ways -2,600 men responded, only twenty  expressing a  wish toremain soldiers.   (2)  The people&apos;s army, which is to be kept  at  Petrograd, will consistof twenty-four t wo-battalion rifle  regiments.  (3)  Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Council ruledeverything, and the  Government did  not assert  itself.  The soldiers were  in favourof the war so long as they  had  not got to go to  the front themselves.   There  wasgrave danger that they might be corrupted by the  peace propaganda which the Govern-ment permitted.    (4)  General  Alexieff would remain  Chief for  the present :  on hisinitiative  several  commanders  have been  removed.  (5) Most  officers  said that  thetroops in the  front line had not been affected by the madness of  Petrograd.     2. The Navy. The condition of the Navy is such as to cause great anxiety.     The Foreign  Office  telegraphed to  Sir G. Buchanan on  the  2nd April [No. 621]saying that the Admiralty had received a telegram from the  senior naval officer at archangel, who said that the pott was actually controlled by the Committee of Sailors,Soldiers, and Workmen, on which the  officers were  represented, though  they had  but little voice.  On the  30th March the  local committee  arrested  twenty-seven officersand requested the acting C.-in-C.  to send them to Petrograd under arrest : twenty-six were so sent and others are to follow.[898-37]B
     3. Miscellaneous. (1)  The feeding problem  at Petrograd is more satisfactory.There was a supply for  10 days in reserve [No.  424].  (2) Mr. Lloyd  George&apos;s message to the Russian Prime  Minister made an  excellent impression, and  no  exception wasnoticed to its reference to the Emperor.  But the expression of sympathy contained  in mr. Bonar Law&apos;s speech had provoked unfavourable comment  in  several papers, andespecially in the official  journal of the Labour party [No. 414].  (3) Sir G. Buchanantelegraphed on the 29th March [No.  415] that the visit of British labour representativesaccompanied  by Gregory Alexinski  would be welcomed by  the Minister for ForeignAffairs.                       Emperor Removed  from Tsar shoe Selo.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 3rd April [No. 453] that he had  been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Emperor had been removed from TsarskoeSelo to the villa at Peterhof  where their Majesties generally resided in  the summer.The reason given for the change of his  place of residence was that it was easier to ensurehis safety at Peterhof by surrounding the grounds of the villa with troops.                                      Loans.     Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan  on the 29th March [No.  595] thatthe Russian Ambassador at Tokyo had been authorised  to sign the agreement  for theloan of 70 million yen.  And on the same  day Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 422]that he had learnt that  the Russian  Government intended to float an internal loan  foran unlimited amount.  Private  State Banks would  take  3,000 million roubles  betweenthem, and the loan  would  be at 5  per cent., issued at 85, to  be  paid  off at  par  byannual drawings beginning in five years and ending in fifty.                                   FINLAND.               ;                     Proclamation by Provisional Government.     Sir  G.  Buchanan  telegraphed  on the 31st March  [No.  432]  that the RussianProvisional Government had  published on the  20th March a proclamation repealing theimperial  manifestoes of the 15th February, 1899,  and the 8th  June, 1908, the law ofthe 30th June, 1910, the imperial enactment of the  2nd June, 1 904, and the manifestoof the 12th June, 1890, respecting postal  administration, and regulations of the 30thSeptember, 1909, respecting railways.   These were the principal enactments curtailingthe free  Finland, and the proclamation instructed  the-Finland Senate to  lay before theProvisional Government the necessary proposals for amending other enactments passedof late years  against the  laws of Finland.  The proclamation also  granted completepolitical amnesty, and promised to submit to the Finland. Diet proposals for a new formof administration, and, if necessary,  a  new constitution.   The proclamation ended  byconfirming the rights of the Finns under their constitution [group undecypherable].Finns regard proclamation as granting all  they desire, and the Diet will meet on the4th April.                                    POLAND.                    Scheme for Settlement of the Polish Question.    Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on  the 29th and 30th March [Nos.  416 and 427] sayingthat a proclamation to the Poles had  been published.  The scheme of settlement wasthat Poland should form an independent State on the following  conditions :      1. Beunion of the three  parts at present held by Russia, Austria, and Prussia.     2. Non-participation of any Poles in the war on the side of our enemies.     3. Military alliance with Russia.     4. The eventual form of government of the  new State to  be  decided  by a           constituent assembly elected by universal suffrage.     5. Revision of the  above by the Russian constituent assembly  when  elected.     In the course of conversation he  had  congratulated  M. Miliukoff on a step whichwould not only secure the loyal co-operation of the Poles, but would also be acclaimedwith enthusiasm throughout the civilised world.  His French colleague, &quot; who so  oftentook the  wrong  line,&quot; on  the other  hand, said that the grant  of independence was a mistake.
                                  THE SENUSSI.                                Tripartite Agreement.      Mr. Balfour  telegraphed  to Lord Bertie on the 28th March [No. 825]  instructing him to inform the French Government  that  he had that day signed with the French and Italian  Ambassadors  a  tripartite agreement respecting  the  Senussi.  He had informed  M. Cambon  that negotiations were  taking place  with the Senussi with  a view to  the pacification of the Senussi  country,  and that the  French Government would probably soon be invited to concur in the opening of certain coastal  markets in Egypt and  Cyrenaica  (Benghazi,  Derna, Tobruk, and  Sollum), on  the  understanding that they would be closed again on the  first sign of danger,                               Reopening of Markets.      Mr.  Balfour  telegraphed to  Sir  R.  Wingate  on  the  29th  March  [No.  326] instructing him to consult with the Commander-in-chief and then to telegraph proposals as to the conditions which  we should lay down  as essential  to our  concurrence in the reopening of markets.  Mr. Balfour would then take the necessary action at Rome and ask Sir R. Wingate to  instruct Colonel  Talbot accordingly.   It would, in any case, be clearly understood that the markets would be closed again on the first sign  of supplies from them reaching our enemies or of  Idris not fulfilling his engagements.  Colonel Talbot should be instructed to inform Idris that we were in active correspondence with the Italian Government, and that we trusted that he would stay on until an agreement was reached.      Sir R.  Wingate replied  on the 1st April [Nos. 357 and 358],  saying that the following were the conditions :       1. Sollum  to  be the  only (Egyptian) market to which western  Arabs should have            access.      2. Supplies to be imported to  Sollum from Alexandria only.      3. Only a limited  number of carefully selected merchants to be allowed to engage            in this trade.      4. Purchasers at Sollum to be supplied with  a pass  from Idris in a form approved            by us ; Idris must  clearly understand  that the supplies to be obtained from            Egypt were limited by the fact of the  prohibition  of foodstuffs  from this            country except  in  small quantities  and for  our Allies, whose requirements            were not likely to decrease.   If Idris could encourage  the import into            Egypt of sheep from the  west this  would dispose us  to  give greater            consideration to his own requirements.     The Commander-in-chief  consented to the above conditions, but desired once  more to place on record his strong objection, from the military point of view, to the policy of reopening markets on the western frontier of  Egypt.     Idris had informed Colonel  Talbot that he  must leave in three or four days, and-would then be out  of touch.       [898-37]                                                       B  2     M. Miliukoff said that he should send  a  circular telegram to the allied Govern-ments, and he thought that we might associate ourselves with the step which had beentaken  by addressing a telegram of  congratulation  to  the Provisional  Governmentrecognising  Polish  independence  in  principle,  and  by  publishing  some  sort  ofcongratulatory proclamation to the Poles.                                  ABYSSINIA.                                   Aeroplanes.     In reply  to  a request from  Mr.  Thesiger [No.  23]  for a  reconsideration  of thedecision  in regard  to  his  application  for  permission  to  use the promised aeroplanesagainst Magdala,  Mr. Balfour telegraphed  on the  29th  March  [No.  25] that thedecision could  not be modified.  He instructed Mr. Thesiger to explain the matter  toRas  Taffari  and  to tell him  that, though it could  not comply with  his request, HisMajesty&apos;s Government wished  him every success in his campaign against Lij Yasu.
     Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate on the 2nd April [No.  339] approvingthese conditions, and  asking him to inform  Colonel Talbot, and  to instruct him tosupport the Italian delegates in  their  endeavour to come to a  satisfactory agreementbefore Idris left.                                 Italian Prisoners.     Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 29th March [No. 348] transmitting a message from Colonel Talbot saying that 45 Italian prisoners had been  handed over, and thatthere remained 4 others (3 at Jaghbub and 1 at Kufra) whom Idris had pledged himself to deliver.                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.                                    Operations.     The Arab  Bureau telegraphed on the 30th March [A.B. 153] that  Tebuk-MedainSaleh section of the railway (164 miles) was reported by deserters to  be  held  by600 men and three aeroplanes.   Some Turkish forces  were stated to have retired fromMedina or El Ula, but the numbers were not stated.     Sir R.  Wingate telegraphed  on  the 31st March [A.B.  161] that  an  Arab force,which was supported by two guns and two machine-guns, had  attacked Abu-el-Mainon  the  previous day ;  and again,  on  the 1st  April, that 2,000 camel men (including242 shaykhs of the Roala, Sherarat, Howeitat, Beni Sakhr, and El Amram) had cometo Faisal at Wej.   He expected many more shortly.     SirR. Wingate telegraphed on the 3rd April [A.B. 193] that the Arabs bad cut therailway between Darroun Hamra  and Sanha,  about  110 rails destroyed and telegraphline cut.  One  Turk was  killed and twenty-one were captured.   The last train passedDarroun from  north on the 24th  March.   On  the 2nd April the majority of Faisafsarmy had left Wej  for  the interior.     On the same  day  the Arab  Bureau  telegraphed [A.B. 194] that 800 Roala had arrived at Wej with their Shaykh and had brought presents of 20 mares and  70 ridingcamels.                              New  Minister of War.     King  Hussain has appointed Mahmoud-el-Kaisoumi (formerly commander of thegarrison at Mecca and  a captain in the Egyptian army) to be Minister of War in placeof Aziz-el-Masri.                                 Colonel Bremond.     SirR. Wingate telegraphed  on  the 29th March [No.  344] saying that he hadreceived from  a  very  reliable  source in Mecca  the following  record  of the recentactivities of Colonel Bremond.  The French       1. Offered to build a light  railway from Jeddah to Mecca at once or after the war.           The King replied that  the time had not come for the consideration of such a           project.     2. Asked King Hussain to purchase a wireless set from  them for 5,000Z. which he           refused to do.     3. Pressed six times  that &quot;the new  Arab  coinage  should   be  minted  in  France,           guaranteeing  to  give  better terms  than  any other country.  A non-           committal reply was given on the King&apos;s behalf.     4.  Again approached the King about a French  bank for Jeddah : but  the King           said that he was unable to countenance any banking operations in Jeddah           at present.     A telegram from the Foreign Office [No. 325] crossed this.   Mr. Balfour said that colonel Bremond appeared to be rapidly assuming the function of intermediary betweenKing Hussain and the allied Powers,  and he was somewhat perturbed thereat.   Apartfrom question of  the Ottoman Bank,  he had recently been approached  by the FrenchGovernment in regard  to the  export of hides from Hejaz, the increase  of Customsduties,  and an alleged application from  King  Hussain  for  a  wireless installation toconnect Rabegh, Jeddah,  and Mecca.   He thought that Colonel  Wilson should take an* early opportunity of endeavouring to  ascertain from King Hussain the facts  regardinghis recent  dealings  with Colonel  Bremond  and of impressing  upon his Lordship the
desirability  of making  his  applications through  one channel only and that  British.Alternatively instructions might be  givers to the British officers in  Hejaz to showgreater promptitude in anticipating his Lordship&apos;s wishes.  As to which he asked Sir B.Wingate to telegraph his observations.     Telegraphing again  on  31st March  [No. 335]  to say  (while  awaiting Sir B.Wingate&apos;s observations) that he was strongly deprecating to the French Government theprovision of wireless, or representations regarding export of hides,  the latter on  theground that being a non-military question  it appears to be outside the province of ahead of a military mission.NEJD.                             Ibn Saud and Ibn Eashid.     The Arab Bureau  telegraphed  on the 28th March [A.B.  126] that, according to aBasra report, the chief political officer  had wired urging  Ibn  Saud to act immediatelyagainst Ibn  Bashid.   Ibn  Subhan and Ibn  Tawalah  were  being  instructed  to(? co-operate with) Ibn Saud.   It was said that Ajaimi was with Ibn Hadhdhal.YEMEN.                                Turkish Operations.     The G.O.C. Aden  telegraphed  on the 28th March [No. 542]  that confirmatoryreports had been received in  regard to the movement of the  Turkish detachment toYemen, notably Yusufiyin.KATIE..                                Approval of Treaty.     In a despatch from Delhi dated  the 27th February, Sir P.  Cox was informed thatthe treaty which he had concluded with the Shaykh of Katir had been  approved by HisMajesty&apos;s Government, wmich appreciated the skill with which  he had  conducted thenegotiations,                                MESOPOTAMIA.                           Civil Government of Baghdad.     Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 29th March informing him asto the conclusions which had  been  arrived at by a  committee  of the  War  Cabinetappointed to consider measures for  the future  administration and political  control ofArabia and Mesopotamia.  Mr. Chamberlain desired that the Viceroy should  at onceinstruct Sir P. Cox that behind the Arab facade Baghdad was to be administered as an arab province by indigenous agency, and, as far  as possible, in accordance with  existinglaws and institutions.   In particular :  (a) The present land revenue system was not tobe disturbed ; (b) the employment of  Indians in any branch of  the administration wasto be strictly discountenanced, and no Asiatics from outside were to be employed unlessof Persian or Arab descent Or  domicile ; (c) the Irak code was  not to be used, but thelocal judicial system maintained as regards both land and personnel, only substitutingArab for Turk ;  (d)  similarly, with  the  executive and administrative machinery, thetribal system of government, provincial and  local  councils, &amp;c,  were to be resuscitatedand maintained.     Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed again  to the Viceroy on the  30th  March  informing him  that it was proposed to appoint  a  Judicial  Adviser from the Arabic-speaking staffof Egypt, the Sudan, or the Levant, and  to send some junior  officers from the sameservices to fill other political posts and  for  revenue  purposes.   The appointment of a deputy to Sir P.  Cox at Baghdad from the same source was under consideration.  Theobject  was to provide him with a staff familiar with the Arabic language and with Arabcustoms, as well as with Turkish law and administration.                         Protection of Tombs and,Mosques.     The G.O.C., Force D, telegraphed to the  D.M.I. on the 1st April informing him that among the first measures for securing law and order on occasion of our occupationof Baghdad  was the provision for protecting all  tombs and mosques, including  that ofShaykh Abdul  Qadir Jilani.  Troops had been, prior to the occupation, warned against
 entering it, and a Moslem guard was mounted at each entrance to prevent ingress &quot;of non-Moslems and to safeguard the buildiug and precincts generally.  He had  received Saiyid  Abdurrahman  Effendi,  the ( .  . . QI  .:.. .  )  of Baghdad and  hereditary custodian of the  shrine, who had been personally consulted  in  regard to  the measures.. taken as  to redemptions (sic);  the  former frequenters  of  the  mosques had  had undisturbed and  unresisted access to it.                                     PERSIA.                          Effect of the Russian  Revolution.     With  reference to his  telegram  No.  115 [Eastern Beport  IX], Sir  0.  Marling telegraphed on the 29th March [Nos. 117 and 118] that (l) he had learnt confidentially that the Persian  Government had received a telegram from  its Minister at Petrograd saying that the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs had expressed  his sympathy with the  democratic movement in  Persia; (2) the democratic  movement was  growing in force, and its authors were already speculating on Bussian support against our interests. In  regard  to these three telegrams, Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed  on the  29th March [No. 417] saying  that (I) he had communicated their substance to the Foreign Minister; (2) the report of  the Persian Minister  was inaccurate ; he, M.  Miliukoff, had expressed sympathy  with Persia in general terms, and had said nothing about  sympathy for democratic [? Government];  (3) the Persian policy of the Provisional Government was to act in  complete  accord with the British Government, and nothing would  be  done except in  concert  with  it.  On the 31st March  Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed  from Petrograd  [No. 433] that the Assistant  Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed  him that the Russian Charge dAffaires had been instructed to concert with Sir  C. Marling, but that the Russian Government adhered to the policy agreed upon by its predecessor with His Majesty&apos;s Government.     Sir C. Marling telegraphed on  the  2nd April [No. 127] that the position of the Cabinet was then pretty well restored.  The  Russian Charge  dAffaires had  made  a declaration  to  the  Prime Minister in the sense that Russia  did  not wish to see any political change in Persia  at present.                             Russian Troops in Persia.     Sir C.  Maiding telegraphed on the 29th March [Nos. 120 and 121] that the troops at Kasvin  had returned  to  their duty  after having  been guilty  of various acts ofinsubordination.  Similar  occurrences had occurred in  other garrisons, but  he had no reason for supposing that  there had been serious consequences.  The Consul at Tabrizhad reported that the new Russian  Government  had  been accepted by  the troops,who had made the liveliest demonstrations of friendship with the  Allies, and in favourof continuing the war.     He telegraphed again on the 1st April [No.   125] saying  that the  Russians  had captured the Paitak pass,  and so opened the road to Kasrishirin.                           Persians in Russian Custody.     Sir C.  Marling telegraphed again on  the  29th March  [No. 119] in regard  to  anumber of  Persians who were implicated  in the disorders at Shiraz  last year, and whohaving been handed over to the Russian military authorities at Ispahan, were now some-where on the way between Kum and Kasvin.   Deputations of  women had  petitionedthe Shah and  the  President of the Council  to  prevent their  deportation to Russia,and at the  urgent  request of the  Prime Minister,  and after  consultation with  the Russian Charge  dAffaires, he had  agreed that  the  latter should  ask  the russian military authorities not to deport them for the present, but he anticipated that  a move-ment would be  set on foot  for their  release, or at least for their  being transferred toPersian custody.  The Russian Charge d&apos;A(faires  was in favour of latter course ;  andSir C. Marling feared that he had allowed the Persian Government to understand  thathe would agree to it.   On the 31st March Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 97]  that hewas content to leave the matter to the discretion  of Sir C. Marling.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R.  HARRISON.-5/4/1917.
