SECRET.-&quot;-1-                                                                .   &apos; 3APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT  No.  1.EUROPE.                                     RUSSIA.     1. THE summary of telegrams under the heading &quot; Poland and the answer to theAmerican note&quot; shows the course of negotiations on this subject in compendious form.In the  next report of this series, there will be attached an  appendix giving a briefanalysis of the division and attitude of political parties in Poland towards the Ententeand the Central Powers, and the various schemes which have been  mooted.     It is to be noted that, during -the discussions between the Ambassadors and. theRussian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the latter drew attention to the  danger to Russiaof Germany&apos;s applying the principle of nationality to the Baltic provinces and Lithuania.The  cause of this apprehension is made clear by a glance at the Statesman&apos;s TranslucentAtlas superimposing maps  8 B and 8 C on the base map.     2. The internal situation in Russia is now passing through a  critical stage, whichhas been accentuated by the suppression of Rasputin, and the Ernperor&apos;s support  ofM. Protopopoff.   A summary of the development of this crisis is given on pp. 3 and 4.     It  is to be noted  that opposition to the Emperor and the  unpopularity of theEmpress  are not  confined  to  the forces represented by  the  Duma,  but that  bothConservative nobility and military officers are  affected.                                    RUMANIA.     The summary of correspondence under  this head, describes the political dangers of evacuating Moldavia, leaving Germany a  free hand to reconstitute Rumania under anew  Government, by taking advantage of the feeling of chagrin  and suspicion which exists among the Rumanians.   Negotiations and telegrams in regard to the destructionof grain left behind in the retreat are worthy of study.AFRICA.                                 NORTH AFRICA.     There is nothing of importance to  report in regard to Algeria, Tunis, Tripoli, orEgypt.   The arms traffic in Abyssinia should be noted, as  it will probably come up forfurther consideration.     The  assasination of the British ConsuTs native servant in the German Consulate atTetuan, in Spanish Morocco, is  a very good example of the lengths to which the enemyis prepared to go when occasion offers.ASIA.                              THE  ARAB MOVEMENT.     The situation in Hejaz  remains stationary, and the question of the British brigadebeing  despatched  to  Rabegh  remains  unsettled  until  the  King  declares  himself      [898-24]
responsible for the introduction of Christians into Hejaz.  He is little likely to do thisunless his affairs are at a desperate pass.  The value  of the  Arab movement to  theEntente Powers  is shown by the table on p. 6 to amount to the cancelling of no lessthan  five Turkish divisions, which would, under other  circumstances, be liberated for service in Europe or against the Caucasus or Mesopotamia.                         IDBISI AND THE FARSAN  ISLANDS.    Idrisi has given an unsatisfactory answer to Colonel Jacob both  in  substance andin form.                                     PERSIA.    The situation in  Persia is not yet sufficiently clear  to admit of appreciation.   Aresume&quot; of the situation will be prepared for an ensuing number.   When it is ready it willbe inserted in the appendix.                                    TURKESTAN.    Our latest news from Russian Turkestan is  of the 28th  October, when a certainamount of unrest was reported, but nothing serious.                                     INDIA.    The activities of the Germans in regard to  Indian sedition are not very noticeablethis week, with the exception of the  subvention  paid  to the Indian seditious newspaperprinted in-San Francisco.                                     NEPAL.    Friction between Nepal and Thibet should be noted.                                  AFGHANISTAN.    The Turco-German agents continue to reside in Afghanistan.  Their presence is always a potential menace, but what they can  effect naturally  depends on  the successor non-success of the Turco-German operations in Irak, Syria, and the Caucasus.

                                     RUSSIA.                    Poland and the Answer to the American Note.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 1st January [No. 3] that the French  Ambas-ambassador had that morning read his draft reply to the American note to the Minister forForeign Affairs.     The Foreign Minister proposed to submit a new text, for reference to the Emperor,of the manifesto about Poland, as  he considered that too much of an international character was given  to the Polish question by the French text.    Sir G.  Buchanan andthe French Ambassador pointed&apos;  out  that the question  could  not be divested of its international character so far as Posen  and Galicia were  concerned, and  that it wouldbe a mistake to omit the passage  altogether, as had been at first  proposed, as the ideaof the reunion of the Polish provinces would be received with sympathy in  the UnitedStates.     On  the  2nd January, in  the course of another conversation with the  ForeignMinister, Sir G.  Buchanan  [No. 7] informed him of what Count de Salis had reported as to the impression created at  the Vatican by the idea that Russia was to have an enlarged Poland and Constantinople;  and he further urged the importance (with theview of conciliating public opinion in the United. States)  of emphasising the fact thatour aim was to reunite Poland.,, . .   ...     In reply  to these  two  telegrams  Mr.   Balfour   telegraphed   [No.   26]   toSir G. Buchanan on the  3rd  January saying that :-     1. The Anglo-French draft  was based on the theory that after the  war territorial           arrangements should  take account of the principle of nationality this in         * the interests of peace.     2. That being so, to avoid some reference  to  Poland would be extremely difficult,           and a bad effect would probably be produced  in  the United States by this           omission.                                      , ,     3. It had been hoped  that all cause of misunderstanding had been avoided by only           quoting the public pronouncement of  the Emperor.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 5th January [No. 15]. that  he had communi-cated the contents of this telegram to the Foreign Minister before the latter&apos;s audiencewith  the Emperor.  The   Foreign  Minister  had furnished him with  a copy of the modifications he proposed to make in the draft reply.   In regard to Poland he proposed the following paragraph :  &quot;In regard to the incorporation of all  the  Polish  territoriesnow belonging to the Central Empires, with Poland, the intentions of His Majesty theEmperor of Russia have been  clearly indicated in the proclamation which he has justmade to his army.&quot;     Sir  G.  Buchanan also said  that  the  Foreign Minister, in a recent conversation,referring to the words  &quot;based on  the principle   of nationality,&quot; had expressed someapprehension that Germany might urge the application of this principle to the  baltic provinces and Lithuania.     He sent a second telegram [No. 18] on the same day, in which he said that he had told the  Foreign Minister that he feared that the omission  of the words &quot; based on theprinciple of nationality &quot; would be much regretted by His Majesty&apos;s  Government, as itwas a principle which His Majesty&apos;s Government had upheld ever since the war began.The Foreign Minister contended that- it was one which might prove very awkward  tothe Allies if interpreted literally.  France  had Savoy and Morocco, Great Britain  hadher Irish question.   The French Ambassador then joined them, and he  spoke in much the  same sense as to the bad  impression which the omission  of those words  would produce  in France.     Mr. Balfour, on the 6th January, sent an identical telegram to the Ambassadors  inParis, Rome, and Petrograd  in  which he dealt  with the  various points in telegramNo. 15 from Sir  G. Buchanan.   In regard to  Poland, he said that he  confessed  to-regarding with much misgiving the suggested Russian modification of the paragraph - inthe draft note&apos;;   That one  result  of the war would be  to confer  autonomy on Poland was what we wanted to indicate to  the world, and  in particular  to the American public.Without giving any indication of what is to happen to the reconstructed Polish nation,the Russian amendment merely stated that, it is  the intention of Russia  to add Germanand Austrian to Russian Poland.   Mr. Balfour said  that he did not know what objection the
o3Russians had to the formula in the draft, but he was quite  clear that the effect wouldbe unfortunate if they insisted upon the amendment as it stood.  The proposed referenceto Poland differed in one important particular from that in the Emperor&apos;s order  of theday to his army : the word &quot; free &quot; was omitted  before &quot; Poland,&quot; and - if this should be insisted upon, our  enemies  would  Jay hold  of  the change as indicating a  change in russian policy.                            ,      .    !    On the,same day  Mr.  Balfour telegraphed to Sir G.  Buchanan [No. 45], sayingthat in regard to Poland he  should  urge the Russian Foreign  Minister  in the sense ofthe observations in his circular telegram given  above; also tha.t he was asking theFrench Government to give similar instructions  to its Ambassador in Petrograd.    On the 8th January Sir G.  Buchanan telegraphed [No.  3 L] that he and the french ambassador had discussed the ma,tter with the Foreign  Minister, the Assistant Ministerfor Foreign Affairs being also present.  Both of these contended that what the Emperorhad said in Ids proclamation  to the army was a spontaneous engagement which onlyconcerned internal  Prussian  questions, whilst its inclusion in  the  reply to Mr.  Wilsonwould convert it into au  international obligation.   Sir G.  Buchanan himself and theFrench  Ambassador  argued strongly in favour  of  the original  draft;  the ForeignMinister said that before replying he must consult the President of the  Council.   later in the day he had written to say that the Imperial Government accepted the passageconcerning Poland as  it stood in the French  draft;  but that he  must  make  it quite clear  that  his  Government expressly understood  that the elaboration  of the  future status of  Poland could  not be  the subject of international discussions; it must be reserved exclusively for Russia.                   Some Consequences of the Murder of Rasputin.    The following notes are gathered from telegrams sent by Sir G. Buchanan  on the3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th January [Nos. 11,14, 19, 25  and 27] :     1. The confirmation by  the  Emperor  of M.  Protopopoff s  appointment is regarded           as  a direct  challenge to the Duma, and as  His  Majesty&apos;s answer to those           who plotted the  assassination  of Rasputin.  It has aggravated a situation           -which  was  already  causing- the gravest preoccupation.  The Duma  will           never allow  Protopopoff to  appear  in the  Assembly,  as they look on  him           as  a traitor,  and  as  an  advocate of  a  reconciliation with  Germany.          , [No. 14.]    2. The  confirmation of  Protopopoff  led  to  the  resignation  of  M. &quot;Trepoff.           [No. 27.]  The Empress is almost  sure to insist on  the appointment of           someone as  his  successor  who will carry  out  the  firm  policy which  she           considers the only safe one for Russia and the dynasty.   [No. 14.]    3. If Protopopoff  or  some equally  objectionable person  should  be  appointed           President of  the  Council many  Ministers would resign,  and  when  the           Duma met there would probably be  a scandal followed by  dissolution, and           in that case  it is impossible to say what might happen.  [N&quot;o. 27.]    4. The  Empress  regarded  Rasputin as a martyr who had died in  defence of the           dynasty, and she was determined to continue acting  as if inspired by his           memory.  The Grand Dukes were,  Sir G.  Buchanan  believed,  trying to           influence the Emperor in a contrary sense, but he  feared that the influence           of the Empress would prevail.  [No. 27.]    5. Sir G. Buchanan  said, that  he did not wish to be an alarmist, but if, as seemed           probable, other assassinations should follow that  of Rasputin, and  if  the           Emperor continued  in  his present course, the  danger  of an and-dynastic           movement was by no means excluded.   The question of the assassination of           the  Empress was a common topic  of conversation, even among highly placed           officers in  the army,  and he had heard the question of a change of sovereigns           mooted.   [No. 14.]    6. On the 3rd January  the  Grand Duke Dmitri and Prince  Yousoupov were living           in  the  formers  palace  in  Petrograd,  which, as the police believed that           B,asputin&apos;s friends were  plotting to kill them, had been placed under military           protection.  [No. 11.]    7. Sir G. Buchanan said that a friend of his  had  been told by a  member of the           Imperial family, on the 2nd January, that the  Emperor  had  refused  a           request  from the Grand Duke Paul  for the  release of his son, saying that:           &quot;The Empress could not do this for the present.&quot;  [No. 11.]
     8.  On the 6th January Sir G. Buchanan was informed that on the previous day the            Grand  Duke Dmitri had  been ordered  to leave for Persia, where he would            be placed under the orders of General Baratoff.   He was fco be escorted by            an officer, and to  hold, no communication  with anyone en route.   Prince            Yousoupov had also been sent to his estates  in the Kursk Government under            the escort of an officer.   [No. 27.]     9.  Purishkovitch, if he  was not actually one of the  party  at Yousoupov&apos;s palace,            is said  to  have, played a  leading  part  in  planning  the  plot  for  the            assassination.  [No. 11.]     Oh the 9th January Sir G. Buchanan  telegraphed [No. 35] that Prince Golitzine had succeeded M.  Trepoft.   He  had heard that  Prince  Golitzine  was more or less a nonentity, and Protopopoff would apparently be the master of the situation.                                    RUMANIA.                               The General Situation.     Sir G.  Barclay telegraphed on  the 31st December [No. 8 5] that  it had been pointed out to him by a person in whose judgment  he  had confidence that the total evacuation of Moldavia would  give great force to any plea which  Russia might put forward for release from her engagements towards Rumania as  a  reward for her reconquest of the country on  behalf of an exiled Government.   Russia might claim  Dobrudja as  her reward ; for if she is to acquire Constantinople she must naturally covet it.     The feeling was growing that  the  Prussians were  not doing their best, and were planning to thrust Rumania into deeper disaster.  With an exiled d3rnasty and  Govern- ment, the country  being wholly in  the hands  of  an enemy (with whom  such leading Rumanians as Carp and Maioresco and  Marghilloman were on the best of terms),  and elections being nothing but a form, it would be easy to get together a plausible show of&quot;a general assembly which would declare for a new dynasty and &quot;vote a separate peace.     Tilings having turned  out  as they have, it might  be, Sir G. Barclay  added, a separate peace for Rumania  would  be  desirable  from  our point of view,  as it would relieve us from the possibility of the necessity-  of continuing the war only on behalf of Rumania.   But  if a  separate peace  is  considered undesirable, Russia should make a serious effort  to hold her present line in Moldavia.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on  the 3rd January  [No.  12] that  the  French Ambassador  in Petrograd had spoken unofficially to the/Minister for Foreign Affairs about  the  total  evacuation of Moldavia,  pointing out the serious consequences that might ensue and repeating what a  Frenchman, just  returned from Roumania, had told him in regard to the danger of a separate  peace  under  a new  dynasty.   He himself had told the Foreign Minister that Sir G. Barclay shared these  apprehensions  and  had pointed out the importance of&quot; a serious effort being made to hold the present line.     The Foreign  Minister  replied that the  seriousness of the situation was fully realised by him but  Russia  was confronted with  enormous difficulties  owing to  the absence of proper means of communication and to the utter collapse of the Rumanian army ;  he  was to  see the  Emperor on the following day  and  would see if anything further could  be done.     According to Sir G. Barclay, Russia is regarded  with suspicion in Rumania;  this suspicion is utterly unfounded and  it is ridiculous to accuse Russia of the Machiavellian policy of drawing Rumania  into deeper disaster.   Her failure to save Rumania, is due to the defects of her own military  organisation, to difficulties of transport, and to the breakdown of the  Rumanian military system.   It should not be forgotten that General Alexieff had never been  keen about bringing in Rumania and that it was only under pressure from France and England  that he  withdrew his objections.     In  regard to  this  statement  of  the  Prussian  Foreign Minister,  Sir G.  Barclay telegraphed-on the 8th January [No. 17] saying :      1.  That Rumania eventually decided to take the field in consequence of telegrams            received from General Alexieff and General Joffre.     2.  That General AlexiefFs telegram was practically an ultimatum, and contained the            phrase &quot; now or never &quot;  ; but even this would not have altered the considered            judgment of the Rumanian authorities had it not been for General Joffre&apos;s            telegram describing the general military situation in such terms as to justify            the belief that the Rumanian army, as  it  was, could deal effectively with            the maximum number of enemy forces available.
    3. The responsibility for Rumania&apos;s premature action  must surely rest with those           who combined menaces with assurances that only [? slight] opposition would           be encountered, and, at the  same time,  promised assistance which was  not           forthcoming in time to save the situation.    4. It is  admitted that the  Rumanian military equipment was not up to modern           standards, and the  allied  legations had repeatedly reported to that effect.           Partly owing to the  necessity of avoiding any preparations which would           arouse enemy suspicions,  partly to  the  distrust of Rumania&apos;s good faith           entertained  by the Allied Governments, it was impossible to make good           these defects before the war.    5. That Rumania&apos;s military problem was  beyond her  capacity became evident as           the campaign proceeded,  and it was impossible to reinforce her  two long           fronts with sufficient rapidity to  keep pace with  the arrival of  enemy           reinforcements.   The inadequacy  of the communications  must have  been           well known at the  Russian headquarters.                              Destruction of Grain.    On  the  1st January Sir G. Barclay telegraphed [No.  3] that, owing to Rumanianremonstrances, orders were recently issued to Russian divisional commanders to refrain from  destroying  grain  on  the lines of  retreat,  so it would be well that  the  RussianGovernment  should be  urged  to instruct Russian headquarters  in. Moldavia.    Inconsequence, the  Foreign Office telegraphed on  the 3rd  January [No. 27] to Sir G.Buchanan  instructing  him to urge on the Russian Government  that it was essentialthat nothing should be omitted to secure the  destruction of all  grain  stocks  liable to fall into enemy hands.  In reply to this Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 5th Januarysaying that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that the necessary ordersfor the  destruction of all grain stocks on the line of retreat  had already been given.He promised  that he would  impress on the military  authorities  the importance ofinsisting on the strict execution of their orders.                             The Consulate at Galatz.    Major Baldwin, consul-general at Galatz, telegraphed on the 3rd January that hehad closed the consulate on the advice of the local authorities  and the  Russian militaryauthorities.   He  was leaving  Galatz for Odessa.  His  French and Italian colleagues were also leaving.  Major Baldwin was instructed by the Foreign Office  (through the consul-general at Odessa) to proceed to Reni.                                NORTH AFRICA.EGYPT.                                    The Senussi.    Sir  R.  Wingate telegraphed on the 4th January  [No.  13]  that Colonel Talbotexpected to leave in a few days to resume negotiations with the  Senussi.                              French Foreign Legion.    The  French  Government is raising  a foreign legion for service against the Turks ;the legion will be comprised of Syrians and Armenians, who will be divided into groupsaccording to  race and  religion.   On the 7th January Sir R. Wingate  telegraphed[No. 20] that the French Minister had asked whether he might recruit Syrian volunteersin Egypt, and send them to be trained with the Armenians in  Cyprus.   He saw noobjection so long as those liable to serve in the Egyptian army were not taken ; but he did not think that many would present themselves.ABYSSINIA.                                Purchase of  Rifles.    Mr. Thesiger telegraphed  [No. 76] on the  30th December that negotiations for thepurchase of some  20,000 rifles were in progress between the  Government and merchants ;he hoped that the promise to prohibit all entry of arms into Abyssinia until the close of the war would be maintained by the French Government.

Two battalions of 152nd Regiment (48th Division). These people might be encouraged to harass Turkish communications on rail-way and Euphrates. In the middle of November Arabs were reported to be raiding Turkish river convoys near falujah and some Arab troops were reported to have been sent up the Euphrates from Baghdad. These people, who could turn out about 15,000 rifles, are irreconcilable-cilable to Turkish rule. So far we are not iu communication with them. Until recently 5 battalions and 1 cavalry regiment were reported in this area, but 3 battalions have now been transferred to the Tigris line. These Arabs, under Dhari ibn , Tawalah, and Hamud Ibu Suwait, also protect our Nasiriyah railway.

The  above shows the  equivalent  of about  five  Turkish divisions aud a  cavalry regiment alreadycontained by disaffected Mohammedans, while several elements hostile to the Turks have not yet been fullymobilized.SPANISH MOEOCCO.                            Murder of Consular Servant.    Mr. White telegraphed on the  2nd January [No. 1] that it had been reported bythe British vice-consul at Tetuan that one of his servants had been enticed into  theGerman consulate and there  murdered.   This  servant  had been used  for secretintelligence work ; and the vice-consul  had previously intercepted a  letter from  theGerman consul to one of his agents expressing in hardly veiled language his intentionto do  away  with Mr. Atkinson&apos;s  agents if  caught.   At the time of the murder thisconsul was conveniently absent at Ceuta.  The deceased being under British protection,Mr.  White  had  instructed  the  vice-consul  to  make  strong  representations on  thesubject to the High Commissioner.
(2.)  HEJAZ.                              The. General Situation.     No further Turkish advance in Hejaz has been reported since the 28th December :i.e.,  the  most advanced Turkish troops are at  Bir  ibn  Hassani,  70  miles  north  ofRabegh.     Reliable information  proves that the Turkish expeditionary force based on Medinahas  not  been increased above its  former  strength of 12,000.   The force is short  of winter clothing,  and at the end  of December  the sick in hospital numbered 1,200.Scurvy is increasing daily.  Two train-loads of stores arrived at Medina on the 15thDecember,  but apparently there were only eleven waggons on the two trains.     The Turks are  also embarrassed by extreme shortage  of gold in the Hejaz treasurechest,  owing to large  cash payments  having  been made for supplies received from central Arabia.     On the 1st January,  Abdullah, with his force of Arabs, reached Hanakiyah, 80miles NNE. of Medina, making it  impossible for the Turks to  obtain further supplies from Central Arabia.   Meanwhile, the local tribes have been harrying the main Turkishline  of communications, along  the Hejaz Railway ; and on the 9th December a Turkishrepairing party was successfully attacked near Hadizah,  110 miles north of Medina.The  road communications  between Medina and  the  advanced Turkish troops have alsobeen subject to constant Arab raids, the most  important of which  resulted in the capture of  400 camels  near Bir Darwesh (24 miles south-west of  Medina).     On the 3rd January it was reported that, according to a deserter&apos;s statement, therecent Turkish advance towards  the Wadi  Safra.was  a  reconnaissance only, and theTurks were confident of their  ability to  reach Rabegh  &quot; whenever they like.&quot;   In viewof the many difficulties and  embarrassments to which the Turks in this theatre- are subject, and which are summarised  above,  it is considered  that, so long as suppliescontinue to be received at Medina,, the Turks will not venture far from that base.  Thecomplete severance  of  the Turkish communications might, however, have the effect ofcausing the Turks  to advance on Mecca in full  strength,  as  a desperate measure to avert starvation or  surrender.     The Arab Bureau telegraphed on the 3rd January [A.B. 524]  that the contingent on Yambo and  Rabegh being sufficiently strongly held, Faisal  proposed to march  onWejh  and then on El Ula, co-operating with Abdulla, who will  move  from Hanariyshto Wady Ais.   This will harass the lines of communication to Medina, and  open  linesof supply in arms and provisions from  Weih to Plenuff, and  hasten the co-operation ofthe  northern tribes.  Wady Yenbo appears to be still  clear of the Turks.     The Arab  Bureau telegraphed again on  the  9th January [A.B.  566] that therehad  been some fighting between Faisal  and the Turks near Hamra ; and that Ali hadconcentrated his forces at Um el Beirar.                              A Brigade for Rabegh.    The G.O.C. in C. in Egypt telegraphed to C.I.G.S. that the King had  agreed tothe landing of a brigade at  Rabegh,  saying that, as  the High  Commissioner hadconvinced him of  the utility of landing a force by saying that he saw that there werereasonable grounds for  thinking that the Turks might be  successful in  their advanceunless the Arab force  operating in the  interior  had a base from which they could operate to cut the Turkish communications,  and to which they might retire in case of need.   Consequently he begged that the High  Commissioner  might be immediatelyinformed  that  he  approved the landing of a force for the purpose stated, not only atRabegh but also at Yambo.    Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 6th January [No. 15] that :     (a.) He had received a formal application from  the  King for a British brigade to           be landed at Rabegh.    (6.)  He had accordingly arranged with the G.O.C.-in-C. that a brigade  should be           despatched from Suez as soon  as possible.    (c.)  The brigade would be commanded by Brigadier-General Mudge, who would be           given  the status of a divisional general, and be in command of all foreign           units operating in Hejaz.    (d.) Colonel Wilson retained his position, and with his staff would  act as political           advisers and intelligence officers.
     (e.) The  King had been  made  to understand that he  was responsible for the           security of the British contingent from local interference ;  and he had been           asked to notify the general line he would take in explaining the presence of           Christian troops in Hejaz.     (/.) The  King had been  asked to notify his sons that a vigorous  offensive against           Turkish communications with Medina would now be looked for.     (g.) He was in communication with Colonel Bremond in regard to the transport of           French contingents.     In reply to this the Foreign Office telegraphed on the 8th January [No. 19] thatthe Cabinet had decided, that the brigade.should not be sent unless and until the king of Hejaz had (1) in writing made a request for its despatch, and accepted full responsibilityfor  the presence of Christian troops in  Hejaz; and (2) had prepared  for issue  to the moslem world a suitable proclamation explaining why Christian troops  had been landed,which proclamation must, before issue, be submitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government.     This crossed a telegram [No. 22] from Sir B. Wingate, saying that Colonel wilson had already been instructed that before the landing of Christian troops in Hejaz couldbe sanctioned  the King must, in writing :  (l) confirm the application he had made in acipher  telegram, and (2)  give  assurances in regard  to the reception, by the  Arabcommanders  and  tribesmen,  of Christian  troops.    Also that in the  course  of thenegotiations, the folio whig points had been made clear&apos;to the King : -     1.  The despatch of a British brigade had been  recommended as the  only thing           which  could obstruct a  Turkish advance  on Mecca ;  but it would only be           sent with  his formal sanction.     2.  It  would  be  withdrawn  if  local Arabs showed  any  sign of hostility  or           interference; and  in any case if the  menace of a Turkish  advance was           removed.     3.  The brigade would be immobile.     Sir B. Wingate said that he  considered the assurances he had required from theKing to be sufficient; he  fully appreciated the  political objections to the despatch ofChristian troops,  but  he considered those objections,  in comparison with the  risks involved in a collapse  of the Arab revolt, to be of secondary importance.     On  the  10th January Sir  B.  Wingate  telegraphed  [No. 29] that Colonel wilson had reported that the King had asked that the despatch of&quot; the troops might be delayed.Colonel Wilson had been instructed  to  inform him that further procrastination would prevent the sending of the troops.   The King&apos;s final reply would be telegraphed as soonas it was received.                          Senegalese Troops not available.     The Foreign Office telegraphed to Sir R.  Wingate on  the  5th January [No 6]informing him that there had been a tribal rising near Jibuti, in consequence of whichthe French Government could not spare the Senegalese troops.                            Arab Officers for the King.     On  the  5th January  four  Turkish officers  of Arab nationality  left  London  for egypt en route for Hejaz to take service with the King.                                 The King&apos;s Style.     Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 7th January [No 17] saying that the King had again expressed a wish  to be styled Jelala.  Tnis  was the usual style for one bearingtitle &quot; Melik&quot;  and had been  used by both  the French  Mission  and His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment; he would suggest therefore  that  the  employment  of  Jelala in iieu ofSiyada be approved.                                Indian  Seditionists.     Sir R. Wingate, telegraphed on the 7th January [No. 18] that  he was of opinionthat Mahmoud Hassan  and  other  Indian seditionists in Hejaz should be interned,  but
09was in favour of that being done in Malta rather than in Egypt.  The question hadbeen referred to Colonel Wilson  and he  awaited his  recommendations  before makingdefinite proposals.(3.) Asm.                  -                         The Decoration, of Idrisi deferred.     On the 6th January, Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No.  1 8] to Sir R. Wingate that the india Office was not anxious to proceed further in regard to the decoration of Idrisi;therefore it and the consequential offer of a  decoration, to the King should be deferred for the moment, especially as the grant of a Christian  order might embarrass the latter.                               The Farsan Islands.     The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 3rd January [307 A.P.] saying that the salient point of Idrisi&apos;s letter was that the hoisting of the British flag was unnecessary and a reflection on our disinterestedness.   If aggression came from an Allied Power, itwould be sufficient for us to intimate that the islands  were  under our protection ;  if it came from a hostile Power, the hoisting of the British  flag would  be useless, for the suez Canal must have been  lost first.(4.) ADEN.                           Increase of Turkish Garrisons.:     The G.O.C. telegraphed on the 6th January [No. 90] that reports  indicated  thatin the enemy&apos;s advanced posts the Turkish garrisons had been increased and that theArabs had been largely withdrawn.(5.)  JEBEL SHAMMAB,. .     Sir P. Cox telegraphed  on the 3rd January [T. 263] that there had  been, since lastspring, strained relations  between Ibn Rashid and his  brother-in-law Saud Ibn Saleh AlSubhan.   Saud has now finally broken with Ibn Rashid, and has placed  himself at our disposal for raiding and other purposes.   He claims to be able  to gather  to his bannermost of the Shammar ; the Astam section is already with us ; Ismail Bey is  of opinionthat Saud can gather the  Abdahto him, and this would leave with Ibn Rashid only theSinjara section.     Three courses are open to us :      1. We might endeavour to establish  an understanding between Saud and Ibn Saud           with a view to a combined attack on  Ibn Rashid.     2. Saud might be kept  employed on  this side-endeavouring to draw  the  Shammar           away from Ibn Rashid, so that Ibn Saud might be the better able to attack           him on the north-east, and Ibn Shaalan.from the west.     Sir P.  Cox was of opinion that, in view of the Turkish guns said to be  with  IbnRashid, not much would result from either of these courses, but there remained :      3. That if the Aslam, under Ibn Tawalah, and the Abdah were prepared to back           Saud  and proclaim him  Emir we should give  the  movement  our  moral           support in the hope of the Shammar  deserting Ibn Rashid ;  Ave must assist           Saud financially but should make it clear that there would be no question of           troops moving out to his assistance.     In regard to this he said it must be remembered that Jebel Shammar has only been           independent of Nejd  for seventy years,   and  our support of a new Emir           might not be palatable to Ibn  Saud as there can be no doubt of his hope and           ambition to recover sway over it.   At the  same time it would be  greatly in           the interests of ourselves  and the King of Hejaz to  eliminate Ibn Rashid,           the only remaining stand-by of the Turks in Central Arabia.   It is a matter           of common knowledge that he  is a hot-headed truculeut  youth  wholly           subservient to the enemy who regard his  adherence  as  of  the highest.           importance.    In regard to this Sir R. Wingate telegraphed to Sir P. Cox  on the 9th Januaryinforming him that the Arab Bureau had suggested  certain objections : In regard to      [898--24]                             &quot;               &apos;             D
10CO)the course numbered (3) above, the Bureau said that Saud was a Shubha, not a Bashid,and his capacity to bring in the whole Shammar was  doubtful.  By open  support  of him we should commit ourselves to maintaining Hail against Riadh,  even if the supportwere only moral.  The note favoured the other two  courses and preferred the second onthe ground that Ibn Saud had two  Rashid pretenders  with him,  Dhari and Faisal IbnFahd : Dhari it was  said was a favourite of Ibn Saud, and it seemed unlikely  thatFaisal would support Saud.  Sir R. Wingate  expressed the opinion that these views were deserving&apos; of serious consideration.    And on the 9th January Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the Viceroy saying that ifthere was a reasonable probability that the Shammar could be detached from  Ibn Rashidand used by us to military advantage, the claims of Ibn Saud to Jebel  Shammar werenot strong  enough to prevent us from giving moral support to Al Subhan.    Sir Percy Cox telegraphed on the 6th January  that reliable information had beenreceived  that a caravan from Hail had been intercepted by Saud-as-Saleh on its way toKerbela.*  Saud is  reported  to have taken  many rifles  and some 6,000 liras fromcaravan.                                    PERSIA.                              Sir P. Syhes&apos;s Reports.    Sir C.  Marling telegraphed on the  1st January [No.  2] that all of  the reportsmade by Sir P. Sykes pointed to the view that we were opposed  by the  tribes  in Earsand by a strong party in  Shiraz hostile to the introduction of law and order by a foreignforce, and particularly by an Indian one; and that this movement was  encouraged bythe known  weakness of his column, which previously had  been reported to be at least a brigade.  Sir P. Sykes urged that a force of 300 infantry, 2 Maxim  sections, 2  sectionsof mountain artillery, and a squadron  of cavalry, in all about 600 men, should be  sent from Bunder Abbas;  this, if despatched without delay, would enable him to maintainhimself.  The consul and the Governor-General concurred ;  and Sir C.  Marling hopedthat the  recommendation would be adopted, as  he thought the situation  quite as graveas Sir P. Sykes had reported.                                Prisoners at Shiraz.    Sir C.  Marling telegraphed [No. 3] on  the 2nd January that His Majesty&apos;s consulat Shiraz urged the transfer of  the European  prisoners  at  that place to Ispahan, andthat  there they  should be  handed over  to the Russians; the reason given was  thattheir custody required 150 men, Avho,  in the event of serious eventualities there, wouldbe badly needed.   Sir C. Marling proposed to urge his  Russian colleague to induceGeneral Baratoff to receive them, adding that  eventually  they might be  sent to Russia.    The Foreign Office replied on the  6th January [No.  4] that the  Government  ofIndia was being consulted as to whether the transfer would  not detach more men thanwere then employed in guarding them, and meanwhile Sir P. Sykes was held responsiblefor them.  Sir Charles must now sound his Russian colleague.                              Bahhtiari Tribal Levy.    Sir A.  Hirtzel informed the Foreign  Office on the 6th January  that the Secretaryof State for India concurred generally in the proposals which had been made regardingthe formation of a Bakhtiari  gendarmerie.   He understood that the force would be ofa purely civil nature, like the South Persian Rifles, the incorporation with which should,in his opinion, take place as  soon as possible  in order to affirm the authority of thePersian  Government.  Till that time he  suggested that the cost should be borne byHis Majesty&apos;s Government, as it was undesirable that any claims of the  khans to the ownership and  control of the force should be  encouraged by a pecuniary contribution.He was prepared to advise his Council  to  admit  half the  cost as a  charge on Indianrevenues, provided that the other half was  accepted by the Treasury.                               Persian Baluchistan.     In a. letter dated the 30th September, which has been delayed in transit, the Agentto the Governor-General in Baluchistan gives his views as follows :          &quot;...  /Persian Baluchistan has for a number of years  been  in  fact inde-    pendent of Persia, and during this period of independence and anarchy a  state of       * This sounds impossible; it may be that the caravan was on  its way from Kerbela to Hail.
     affairs has  arisen which it will be beyond the ability or integrity of any Persian     deputy governor  to  reduce to -order.   Without  our  assistance Persia is  quite     unable  to regain control of the border, and  the state of the border must always     remain a matter of interest to us.....&quot;     He, therefore, makes the s\iygestion that Major Keyes and  his mission should beconsidered part of the organisation  for raising  the  South Persian Rifles, and that heshould be appointed by the Persian Government  to be  Governor on its  behalf of theSarhad, Persian Baluchistan, and Persian Mekran.                               Seisian Field  Force.     A  successful  engagement  with  Afghan  gun-runners   took  place  on  the  27thSeptember.  Lieutenant Wahl, United Provinces Horse, charged the enemy lager witha troop of cavalry and was killed in so doing ; but the Afghans retired, leaving 411 oldpattern rifles and 21,560 rounds of ball ammunition.                               Russian - Operations.     Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 3rd January  [No. 5]  that it was  reported thatthe Turks were  withdrawing ammunition  and guns  from Hamadam in the direction ofAssadabad.  And on the  6th January [No. 8]  that  Dowletabad, on the  road ^betweenSultanabad and Hamadam, was recaptured on the 1st January by  a Russian  force,which, however, withdrew again after further fighting.   Colonel Kennion had reportedthat the country round Dowletabad had been cleared of supplies, which had been sentto Kermanshah ; also that there were serious  dissensions between the Turks and theGermans.  The  Russian troops  on the 3rd January reoccupied Bijar.                      INDIA  AND  ITS  NEIGHBOURS.(1.) INDIA.                       The Indian National Party of Berlin.     This party is reported to have lost all its influence with the German Foreign Office,and to be no longer consulted in matters of policy.   This may be due to the failure ofthe German mission to the Amir, which was probably despatched on its advice.                               The&quot; Qhadr&quot; Party.     It is reported  that the German Consul-General  at San Francisco  has been payingRam Chand Peshawari, editor of the &quot; Ghadr,&quot; a monthly subsidy of 240Z.(2.)  NEPAL.     Relations with  Thibet  are strained,  the Lhassa  Government having  adopted abullying attitude towards Nepal, probably  owing  to  the fact  that  the bulk of theNepalese troops  have been lent for garrison duty in  India.  The  Nepalese Governmentis making preparations for the protection of its Thibetan frontier against aggression.(3.) AFGHANISTAN.                             Military  Reorganisation.     It seems prohable that the recent movements of artillery and machine-gun  units are explained  by the gradual introduction throughout  the  country of the  &quot; kandak &quot;organisation now in force in Kabul.  One &quot;kandak&quot; is equal to one-third of  a brigade,and  consists  of 600  infantry, 200  cavalry,  200  artillery,   6  machine-guns,  and mountain-guns.                         Enlistment of Border Tribesmen.     On his return from Kabul, Mullah Fazl Din, the representative  of  the Mahsuds,stated that Nasrullah Khan had cancelled the orders for the  enlistment of waggons andMahsuds on the  ground of expense, and had said that &quot; if the Turks wanted their help,thay must make their own arrangements.&quot;
                           The &quot; Prince of Afghanistan.&apos;   .     The Secretary of State for India telegraphed on the 2nd January to the Viceroy [P.  12] saying that  the Ambassador at- Petrograd  had reported that the son and brother of the Amir of Afghanistan  had arrived at Hamadam and been received, with great honour by the Turks ; his business was said to be the conclusion of a treaty with Turkey.  The &quot;War  Office had learnt from  a reliable  source  that the &quot; Prince  of Afghanistan &quot; was in Bagdad about the 24th December.     The Viceroy  replied  on  the 6th January that a  Kermanshah newspaper had reported that Abdul  Majid  Khan  Afghan  had arrived at that place  on the 5th December, and had proceeded towards Bagdad with Khalil ;  at  Bagdad, according to agents, he attended the opening of a wireless installation.  This  presumably is  Sirdar Abdul Najed (half-brother of the Afghan envoy), whose disappearance from Afghanistan into Russia  was reported  in  the  Kabul diary  on  the 23rd October last.   He  is  a descendant of Pandah Khan,  but of  little importance ; after  a chequered career as  a free-lance in Persia, Russia, Turkey, and Mesopotamia  he  was captured by the Afghan authorities.  Then, having  been pardoned  by the Amir, he  held  a  variety of minor appointments  alternately  with periods  of unemployment.  In all probability, the Viceroy added, he was again acting as a free-lance,                        , -     The C. in C.  India telegraphed to G.O.C. Force D on the 4th January, saying that the only known Afghan Sirdar named Abdul Majid was a distant relative of the Amir, aged about 41  years.   He had lived  at various  times at Basra, Meshed, Mascat, and Constantinople.  He reached Helmand with.a few followers in 1903, surrendered to the Afghan authorities, and was sent to Kabul  as  a prisoner.   He was pardoned  in  1904. After being Governor of Laghman and Civil Governor in Kabul, he was  dismissed in 1908.  He was later on made Governor  of a district in Maimana province,  and in October  1916  was reported  to have crossed  the  Oxus into Russia,  after  having misappropriated Government funds.(4.)

On  the  15th  November  the  railhead  of the  Nushki-Dalbandan  railway was291  miles from Nushki,  which indicates  an  advance of  7f  miles since  the 7thNovember.nUXTBD AT THE POBKIGN OniCK BY C.

APPRECIATION OF  THE  ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT, No  li hnx                                    FOREWORD.    1! THE following report is an expansion of the  Arabian Report, which has  been running fof twenty-seven  weeks, and is designed  to  ^ive a general weekly resume of political and military-political affairs in Russia, Roumania, the Near and Middle East, and Northern Africa.   It  is compiled from papers  supplied  by the War  Office, Foreign Office, India Office, Colonial Office, and  Admiralty.  Military operations and situations are  not referred  to in  this  report, except in  the past tense, and  when they have a direct bearing on  the political  situation as well.   The report is  made  as short  as possible.                                      RUSSIA.     During the past ten days there has been little or no  reference in the Petrograd embassy telegrams to  the  internal political  situation in Russia, which would appear to indicate a lull supervening on the storm which followed RasputhVs suppression.                                      POLAND.     In the appendix are to be found papers which give the main threads of the Polish question.               .                               ,     It is to be noted that Prince Alexander Lubecki&apos;s conversations with Sir  E. Howard coincide with much that is said in Appendix  B.     The  change in Russia&apos;s strategic and national  position should  she obtain control of the Straits does not seem to be considered hy the Poles at present, but it would appear as though the far-reaching effects of such an alteration of the situation could not fail tojhave an ameliorating influence on the present conflict between the national &quot;aspirations of the Poles and the military apprehensions of the Russians.                                     TURKEY.     The  news from Petrograd  of  the  Islamic council in Constantinople is  of  some importance-it marks a fresh step  in the German  Middle  Eastern policy.  A regular machine for the purpose of stimulating rebellion and  assassination in Entente  Moslem areas is being bruit up.  It is a good example of the activity of the  enemy in a sphere in which we are unable to  compete.  As will be seen on p. 5, the Government of  India is forced to remain strictly neutral as regards the King of Hejaz&apos;s war of independence against the Turks  and Germans, while  the German Emperor is at liberty to give his support to Turkish attempts to further  his cause in India.

                                     ARABIA.    The situation in Arabia has distinctly improved, and  there are indications of atendency to collusion among the Arabs which has not been  noticeable hitherto.  Thus-,we  have closer relations between the Shaykhs of Koweyt, MEohammerah, Ibn Saud,&apos;.and the King of Hejaz than hitherto, and a move on the part of Saud Ibn Saleh tdco-operate  with us and  the King  of Hejaz.  Idrisi&apos;s  attitude  cannot,  however,  beregarded as other than moderately unsatisfactory.                                     Tibet.   . The news of Sven Hedin&apos;s mission to Central Asia  may well prove the precursorof trouble.   Sven Hedin will probably lay himself out to spread pan-Turaniamism.                                                                         M. S.

Buchanan telegraphed on the 28th  January  [No. 118] that he had receivedfrom the Rtissian Government a draft agreement, the main provision of which was  thatEnglishmen of military age  and not exempted from service, residing  in Russia; and russians, similarly situated  residing in England, should  be given  the choice betweenreturning to their own country for military service and serving  in the country in whichthey resided.                             The Question of Reprisals.     The Cabinet has asked  Lord Milner to suggest  to the Russian Government that,out of consideration for the Allies, they should not carry out in  practice their  threat  torefuse recognition of enemy hospital ships  in the Black  Sea.   Two Russian hospital       [898-28]                                                            BSECRET.
 ships were torpedoed in the Black Sea in the  first  half of last  year, and  the Turkish Government was notified that the Russian Government could no longer recognise the right of Turkish hospital ships to immunity.   The  Admiralty considers the  action of- the Russian Government highly detrimental to the interests of Russia&apos;s Allies, doubting whether the policy of reprisals could be confined to  the Black Sea.                                     POLAND.      Sir Esme Howard telegraphed from Stockholm, on the 22nd January, saying that Prince Alexander Lubecki, a Pole, who had &apos;been there for a few  dajrs, had spoken at length on  the Polish question.   He  said :       1. That he feared unless the Allies took some definite steps to reassure  the Poles            as to their  future,  the  Germans  would  get  their way in regard  to  the            introduction of  conscription, and  that  the  army, when ready, would no            doubt be used to fight Russia.      2. That the Poles had  absolutely no  confidence in the promises of the Russian            Government, and so long as the Allies continue to treat the Polish question            as an internal Russian one, and not as an international one, they felt that            they had no security for their future.      3. If  the Allies would  declare &apos;that they  were  in  favour,  not of an  autonomous            Poland under Russia,  but of an independent Poland, he believed  that this            would  make impossible  the creation  of a Polish  army  under  German            pressure.     Prince Alexander  Lubecki told  Sir  Esme Howard that, like most  Poles, he was first and foremost a Pole, and outside Poland  his sympathies were with  England and France.                                   RUMANIA.                       Rumania and the Petrograd  Conference.     Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 26th January and again on the 27th [Nos. Ill and 115] in regard  to  a request  to attend the coming  conference made by the Prime Minister of B/umania,* who was in Petrograd.   After discussion  between the  Ministerof Foreign Affairs and  the  Ambassadors of England, France, and Italy, it was agreed that he should be told  in a friendly manner that, while it was impossible to admit him as a regular member of the conference,  he should  be  invited  to attend sittings on matters directly concerning Rumania.                          Destruction of Stocks and Plant.     Sir  George Buchanan  has informed the  Rumanian  Minister  in Petrograd that for military reasons the proposal to discontinue  the destruction of stocks and plant likely to fall into enemy hands could not be entertained,  but that  stocks not exposed to immediate  capture would  be  treated  with   all  possible consideration.   [Petrogradtelegram No. 63 ; 15th January.]                                    TURKEY.     Sir G. Buchanan  telegraphed on the  30th January [No. 125] that  he had beeninformed by the Russian Government that they had  received secret information that anumerous assembly of mujahids  and shaykhs  had been  held at  Constantinople underthe  presidency of Mussa Kiasim, formerly Shaykh-ul-Islam.  This assembly  had thecharacter of a Moslem general council,  and it appears that  the idea originated with the German Emperor.  Its principal decisions were : (1)  that  the Shaykh-ul-Islam shouldbe invited  to publish a new Fetwa, &quot;inviting Mussulman  subjects of Turkey (sic) and enemy States to revolt&quot; ; (2) to  send Hajji Sami to India with  letters from  Hindoo officers inviting their  compatriots  to  rise  against  England ;  (3) to organise  aninsurrection in Morocco with the secret help of  Spain; (4) to continue with  all  possifreenergy the holy war against the Italians in Tripoli.    *  In one telegram the Prime Minister of  Rumania is spoken of; in the other  the Rumanian Minister ofForeign Affairs.
     Some  of these  decisions  appeared  to have been  already  carried into  effect :(l) Turkish and German officers, with machine-guns and ammunition, have left Adaliafor Tripoli on a submarine ;  (2) 10,000 men have been assembled at Murzuk Fezzan forhostile purposes in Tunis and Algiers; (3)  Sami has left for India.                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.                              The Military Situation.     Sir B,. Wingate telegraphed on the 29th January [No. 77] that with British, naval assistance the Turkish garrison at Wej had been driven inland with a loss of 20 killed,80 prisoners,  2 guns and 400 rifles.   The Arabs were showing greatly increased activityas regards raiding, and as  a consequence the  Turkish advanced  parties threateningYambo and Rabegh had been withdrawn.                               The King&apos;s Subsidy.     Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on  the 29th January [No.  80] that the King had askedfor;  (1)  50,0007,.  and 20,000 rifles to enable him to take steps to bring in  the BilliHuweitat and other powerful  tribes in Northern  Hejaz ; and (2)  a larger subsidy onaccount of his increased sphere  of operations in Northern Hejaz.  &apos; He did not recom-mend (2). but he strongly recommended (1),  and asked that he might be authorised toissue 50,000Z. forthwith, and such further sums as might be required  to achieve specificobjects up to a total sum not exceeding 100,000Z.                         More Arab Officers for the King.     On the 27th  January the D.M.I.  telegraphed to the Arab Bureau saying that theRussians had been asked by us to hand  over sixteen Arab officers,  prisoners of war;they would be sent to Egypt in due course.  The  King of Hejaz must clearly understandthat these officers, and any  others who might be sent, would come entirely under him for all emoluments, expenses, and administration as soon as they left Egypt.ASIE.                              Idrisi and the Imam.     Lieutenant Nalder, R.N.Y.R., on the 20th December last, sent to the Resident at aden a report of an interview he  had had  with  Idrisi on  the 17th December,  the commanding  officer of H.M.S. &quot; Lunka &quot; being present.                  *     Sounded as to the  possibility of an entente  between himself and  the Imam, he saidthat he did not think that it would be to  the Imams  interest to abandon  the  Turks.The  Zaidia were against him because he was in  favour of the Turks and the Shafeiabecause he was Zaidi;  the  Turks were his  only support.   At the same time, shouldthe Imam wish for an  entente,  he would  be  quite  willing to meet his proposals; but his terms would include the possession of the coast plain as far as  Mokha, includingHodeida and Zebid, to  which area the Imam  had no claim.   It was impossible for him(Idrisi) to make the first move.   He was now going to take the field and if the Imamcared to join  in well and good ; in any case he was going to  act.  As soon  as bis gunnershad been sufficiently trained at Aden he  would attack Loheiya ; when that had fallenhe would consult  with the British Government as to the direction in  which he  should proceed.   He did not wish letters to the  Imam  from  the British  Government to pass through his territory, and said that they could just  as easily be sent from Aden throughthe Abdali Sultan.     It  appeared  from a  conversation  that  Lieutenant Nalder had  with  YehiaAbdurrahman-el-Filali,  who had come from Aden with proclamations and letters fromthe King of Hejaz for  the Imam,  that Idrisi was  showing himself very averse to hisgoing to the Imam.   Yehia suggested that Idrisi was afraid of an  alliance between us and the Imam, which would mean an end of the Turks in Yemen and our having no further use for him.                                 Farsan Islands.     The Resident at Aden  telegraphed on the  25th January  [No.  316 A.P.]  that  thecommander of H.M.S.  &quot; Perth  &quot; had informed   him that the&quot; treaty with Idrisi was concluded at  midnight on  the 22nd January,  and that the  British flag had. beenhauled down and  the troops  removed from the Farsan islands at noon on the 23rd.       [898-28]                                                       B 2
 Yemen.     In a report made to the Resident at  Aden  by Lieutenant L. F. Nalder, R.N.V.R., and dated the 20th December last, it was mentioned that Idrisi had stated that he had heard that there had been dissension between the  Imam and his son ; it was  a family quarrel having nothing to do with politics, and they had been reconciled. ADEN.     The Resident telegraphed on  the  24th January [No. 315 A.P.] that the French Government proposed  to form some Arab &quot; compagnies d&apos;etapes,&quot; and were sending Captain Dupuis to Aden  to go into the question.   The Resident proposed to  give him facilities on the  lines of  the permission  granted to Italy in 1915.   Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed on the 30th January to the Viceroy that, if he saw no objection, and if he did not himself propose to recruit there, the Resident might proceed as he proposed.     The G.O.C.  telegraphed on the 30th January [No. 211] that there were indications that the enemy had increased their strength about B. Umr Hatum, and were generally becoming more active. JEBEL SHAMMAR.                                  Saud Ibn Saleli.     On the  15th January Sir P. Cox telegraphed [No. 380] that Saud Ibn Saleh [set; Arabian Report N,S. XXV, p. 4] wished that a telegram might be sent in his  name to the King of Hejaz, saying that he had offered his  services to the British Government and intended to act as  it wished, and that he  was hostile to Ibn Rashid and should endeavour to draw the Shammar  to his  side.   Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed on the 19th January to  the Viceroy, asking whether the  transmission of this  message would imply acceptance of his services and commit us to support him.   This was repeated to Basra.  On the  24th January Sir  P. Cox telegraphed [No. 555] that  he had  had a lengthy interview with  Saud, and said that we  were in no way committed to support him in regard to  the emirate, and need have no fear as to how Ibn Saud of Nejd would regard him.  Our friendlies looked up to him, and wavering elements were beginning to trickle in.  He was certain that, with assistance from us in the way of supplies and rifles, and with  the co-operation  of  Asuam Dhafir, he would be able to sweep up and shift Ajaimi, and then push forward  with  a view to establishing touch with Ibn Shaalan on one side and the Nejef  tribes on the other.  Mr. Chamberlain agreed with Mr. Balfour that the message should be sent on.                                  IRAK-ARABI.                               A.jaimi-ibn-Sa&apos;adun.    Sir P. Cox telegraphed on  the 24th January [No. 554], saying that when Ibn Saud was at Koweit  he wrote, on behalf of himself and of the shaykhs  of Koweit and Mohammera, to Ajaimi urging him to join them.   The reply of the last-named has been received ; courteous and dignified, it rejects the overtures uncompromisingly.    [From &quot; Arabian Personalities&quot; it appears that Ajaimi was at first anti-Turk, and had designs on  Basra.  He  was  forestalled  and turned  against us.  He has  a  bad reputation  among Arabs ]                                   Ismail Bey.    Sir P. Cox telegraphed on the 22nd January that he had interviewed Ismail Bey, who expressed  the opinion that he  could act quicker  and better from Irak than from Egypt ;  Sir P. Cox thought this to be undoubtedly correct,  and  it was proposed that for the present Ismail should live at Zubair.  He  might be assisted to get, say, six of his trusted retainers over for his  personal use ; but the idea  of getting from 100 to 400 was  hardly a practical one.  Sir P. Cox thought that there was no doubt of the bona fides of  Ismail.                                   ARMENIA.    We are privately informed that London Armenians have  received a verbal  message from the German Professor  Lipsius (now in Holland) suggesting a &quot; conference of thefriends of Armenia with a  view  to arriving at an arrangement  that would put the wholeof Turkish Armenia  under joint British, French, and German  control.   Failing this,the Germans would be compelled to  come to an understanding on the question withRussia.&quot;
                                     PERSIA.                        Agreement with England and Russia.     The Persian  Government has unofficially asked for. assurances from Russia andGreat Britain, with a view to making  the tripartite agreement  more palatable to  thepublie.  Among them are the following :      1. The substitution of officers of a third Power for British and Russian  officers in            the South Persian Rifles and Cossacks Brigade respectively.     2. Persia to have representatives at the Peace Conference, with merely deliberative            power.  -     3. Non-indemnification of British subjects for losses sustained in Persia during            the war.     4. Engagement on the  part of England and Russia not  to conclude  any future            convention which would infringe Persian independence.     As to  which Sir C. Marling&apos;s comment is that the last may be allowed, but  thefirst three cannot be conceded.                         Indian Policy in Southern Persia.     Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 23rd - January [No. 38] in regard to the recom-mendation of the Government of India to carry on our policy in Southern Persia with aminimum  of reference to Teheran.   He thought  the proposal excellent,  if  it were practicable ; he believed the system  was working  satisfactorily in  Kerman and EastPersia, but  doubted the feasibility  of its application to Fars, where our interests werecentred.   Fars, he  said, was in much  closer touch  with Teheran, and its tribal chiefsmuch more susceptible to Teheran influences ;  so that, for the present, instead of casualreference  to  the legation,  the  closest co-operation would,  it seemed to him,  benecessary.                       INDIA  AND ITS   NEIGHBOURS.India.                                 India and Ilejaz.     The Viceroy telegraphed  on  the  22nd January, in regard to the proclamation ofthe Mecca ulema and notables which had reached India, that the Indian Governmentwas convinced that for it to  push  the proclamation, either publicly or secretly, woulddefeat its object.   For similar reasons  it was also of opinion that there was nothing tobe gained at present by the proposed deputation of influential  Moslems to the King ofHejaz at government  expense.  It was, he said, impossible  for the  Indian Govern-ment to indulge in propaganda, or the support of propaganda, without becoming a party&apos;to religious  controversy.BURMA.

The Germanophil  party  under Nasrullah appears to be out  of  favour with  the amir and much  depressed.

                                  APPENDIX A.                                  POLAND (1).    During the 16th,  17th, and 18th centuries Poland developed a Commonwealthor Republic, with an elected King and based on advanced I^Ml^HMHr individualism.Ethnographical Poland extended her sway and influence  over the  Baltic provinces,Lithuania, Volhynia, Podolia, Ukraina, and Moldavia, thus stretching from the Balticto the Black Sea, and comprising an area of close on 300,000 square miles of territory.Her inherent  weakness, however,  was that of a^tfMHMHS republic surroundedby the  highly  dynastic and military organisms of  Prussia, Russia, and  Austria ofthe 18th century, but the immediate and indirect cause of the first partition of Polandin 1772 was Turkey.   The latter  had declared war on  Russia and was being  badlybeaten when Prussia imposed herself as mediator and saved Turkey and Constantinopleby urging the partition  of Poland as compensation to Russia. Prussia took what is now known  as West Prussia without Dantzig and Thorn, while Lithuania, Volhynia, andthe other eastern and southern provinces outside ethnographical Poland fell to Russiaand Austria.    In  1787 Turkey declared war on Russia, while  England and Prussia were  readyto back Turkey.  Prussia by seductive offei*s induced Poland to conclude a defensivetreaty (1790).   In 1792 Russia declared war on Poland, which was left in the  lurchby Prussia.  The latter Power  joined  Russia in a further and second partition ofPoland  (1793),  Austria being excluded.    In  1794, at  the instigation of France,  General Kosciusko  proclaimed  a Polishrevolution at Cracow  and  declared war  on Russia.  The King of Prussia joined  theRussians in crushing the Kosciusko revolution, and in 1795 the third and final  partition of Poland  between Prussia,  Russia,  and Austria took  place.   Cracow, Galicia, andLadomeria fell to Austria, while  Prussia  got  the largest share,  including Warsaw,of ethnographical Poland.  Frederick of Prussia, in describing this  final partition,declared that the three Powers &quot; partook and communicated of the body of Poland &quot;,a fact which, in his opinion, would bind them in eternal friendship.   The &quot;sacrifice&quot;of Poland has  indeed  been the  bond of friendship between Prussia and Russia for over a  century, i. e. until the  outbreak of  the  pi-esent war  in  1914,  and german influence has always been exerted in Russia to prevent the Russian Government fromdealing  leniently or generously with Russian Poland.    In  1795 Prussia proceeded to Germanise her share of Poland  by changing  the names of districts, suspending Polish laws, forcing the  German language on all stateinstitutions, removing  Poles from all official positions,  and  seizing Polish churchjDroperty.   Austria did  likewise  in Galicia.   The Russian  Emperor  Alexander I waskindly  disposed  towards the Poles  and entrusted  the supervision  of  education in.Russian  Poland  to the Pole,  Prince  Adam  Czartoryski.  The  latter laid  beforeAlexander  I a  project for the reconstruction of Poland as an  independent kingdom under the rule of the  Russian Emperor.  Alexander I was inclined to accept, but theKing of Prussia prevailed on him to reject the  proposal.  The Poles then turned to France  and organised  Polish  legions from among  their  emigrant countrymen.They fought with Napoleon, who  in  1807 by the  Treaty of Tilsit insisted on settingup the  Duchy  of Warsaw, consisting of a  part of Prussian Poland.  All the Balticcoast, with the  exception of Dantzig, which was made into a free city, went to  Prussia.    In  1815, at the Congress of Vienna, the disposal of the Grand  Duchy nearly ledto  a  serious misunderstanding  between Russia, Prussia,  and  Austria.   The return of the common enemy from Elba made them settle their  differences  on the basisof the fourth partition of Poland,  by which the Duchy of Posen and Dantzig went to the King of Prussia, the Kingdom of Galicia and Ladomeria to Austria, and  theremainder  of the Duchy of Warsaw was  made into the  Kingdom of Poland underthe rule of the Emperor of Russia.  The latter consented to the Polish Legionaries,who had fought with  Napoleon against Russia,  returning to  their country  in  orderto organise  the military forces of the new Polish  State.     During the Napoleonic wars  the  idea  was frequently brought forward of  re-constituting Poland under Russia and against  France.  The  Emperor  of Russia,Alexander I, was  hesitant, and in  1813  Prince Czartoryski sent  an agent to  london to  enlist England&apos;s sympathies.   Official circles received him  coldly, though  theOpposition championed the idea.   In 1814  Prince  Czartoryski,  when  accompanyingthe Czar on his visit to England, tried to gain the support of  Lord Castlereagh, who
while professing to wish well to Poland, refused to take any active steps in the matter.The Congress of Vienna stipulated that all three parts  of Poland should receive a Con-stitution compatible with a normal  national development.   The Emperor of Austriaestablished a sham Parliament in Galicia: the Prussian Government made no pretenceof executing its  obligations  and unceremoniously started  a system  of bureaucraticpersecution.   The  Russian  Emperor  Alexander I  alone  granted a  fairly liberalConstitution, with a-Polish Parliament and Executive,  a  Polish  army and adtninistra-tion, the foreign policy alone  being under Russian direction.    There was a certain  incongruity between  this liberal  regime in Poland  and theautocracy of  Russia.  Court  and German influences in the Russian capital worked to restrict the liberties  of thft&apos;*fr higdom of Poland.  The  consequent systematic infrinee-ment  of the Polish Constitution led to the insurrection of 1830.  After its suppressionthe Russian  Emperor Nicholas I  suspended the Constitution, abolished the  nationalPolish Army,  and  brought the  administration  under  the central authorities  inPetrograd.    The Poles  co-operated in and tried  to profit by  the  popular  insurrectionarymovements in 1848.  The  Austrians  ruthlessly suppressed the  rising in  Galicia,while the  Prussian  Government pretended  to grant  a  Constitution  to  Poland  andpromised to go to war with Russia to secure similar liberties for Russian Poland.  Assoon,  however, as Berlin was under control, the Prussian  King Frederick Williambroke his word and ordered his troops to massacre the  Polish volunteers in Posen whowere to have marched on  Russia with the Prussian Army.  The  armed insurrection atWarsaw in 1863 was suppressed by Russia, which abolished all vestiges of self-go vern-ment, removed Poles from the Civil Service,  introduced the Russian  language  into thecourts and schools,  and gave the  official designation  of &quot;District  of the Vistula&quot; tothe territory of the Kingdom of Poland.  The Prussian Government went further  stillin the process of Germanisation of its Polish  provinces, and in 1886 began the officialplantation of Posen  by German colonists.  This policy was speeded up by Bismarck in1894  and subsequent years,  when Polish towns were given German names,  childrenwere  forbidden to speak Polish at school,  and the  use  of the language at public meetings was proscribed.   Finally the Prussian Diet passed a law depriving  Poles oftheir land if required for German immigrants.  In Austria the defeat of 1866 weakenedthe central Government, which gave Galicia  a  separate Diet, recognised Polish as theofficial language, granted  Constitutional liberties, established Polish Universities atCracow and  Lemberg, and entrusted primary and secondary education to the polish authorities.    On the 5th November, in a published letter to the Austrian  Premier, Dr. Koerber,the late Austrian Emperor signified his will, when the new Polish state comes  into existence and coincident with this development, to grant Galicia the right to manageindependently  its own internal affairs in  as full a manner as this can be  done inaccordance with its membership of the State as a whole and with  the  latter&apos;s prosperity,and thereby give the population  of Galicia a guarantee for its racial and economic development.  The population of Galicia would appear to be 40 per cent. Poles, 40 percent.  Ruthenians, and 20  per cent. Jews, the Ruthenians being mainly in the rural districts and the  Poles and Jews mainly  in the towns.    After the institution of the Russian Duma in 1905,  the Polish Deputies, Avhilesympathising with the Cadet Party under the leadership of M. Miliukoff,  maintainedan independent  attitude.   The Russian  Government  was  about to allow the use of polish in the municipalities of  Russian Poland when war broke out in 1914.   TheGrand Duke Nicholas in August 1914  issued a manifesto to  the  Poles announcingRussia&apos;s  intention to create  a United Poland, with linguistic and  religious  freedomand self-government under the sceptre of Russia.   In August 1916 M. Stunner wishedto make a more definite  pronouncement as  regards Russia&apos;s  intentions in the polish question, but before doing so wanted to be enabled to give  the  Russian people someconcrete guarantee as regards the realisation of Russian aspirations in the matter ofConstantinople  and the Straits,  as  a set-off to the sacrifices in territory and bloodconnoted by the Russian, or rather Russo-Polish, solution of the Polish question.  Franceobjected to the declaration concerning  Constantinople on the  ground that it wouldindispose the elements in Turkey who were hostile to the ruling Committee of union and Progress.    M.  Sturmer fell  before the matter was  arranged  and the TeutonicPowers forestalled  Russia and  the Entente  by issuing, on  the 5th  November, the proclamation by  the German  Governor, General  Beseler,  at  Warsaw and by theAustrian Governor, General  Kuk, at Lublin of a Polish Kingdom  with the  Germanand Austrian Emperors as joint guarantors.   This would  be tantamount to a further
partition of Poland, for Galicia and the German Polish districts are excluded, while ithas been hinted that Germany intends forming also an  independent Kingdom ofLithuania and incorporating in her own dominions Lodz and the great industrial region of Western Russian Poland.  Germany promises a hereditary monarchy, a constitution,and a &quot; more precise regulation of the frontiers &quot;.   It is calculated that  a Polish army of some 700,000 men  can be raised by Germany for the defence of the Eastern front,and it  is surmised that this grant of independence is  intended to lend some show oflegality to the conscription of Russian  subjects for a war against  Russia.   The can-candidates for  the Kingship  of Poland are,  apparently,  Prince  Leopold  of Bavaria,son-in-law of the late Austrian  Emperor Francis Joseph, and the Austrian ArchdukeCharles Stephen.  The latter would be a sovereign prince^ojyiie German  Empire and.the whole arrangement would thus  be  a &quot; German  solution &quot;of  the Polish question.The &quot;Austrian solution&quot; may be said to be  bankrupt, and  a  purely Russian solution would  seem  to be practically excluded  owing to the present Germanic conquest  and occupation of ethnographical Poland.    On  15th November,  1916,  the  Russian Government in  an  official communiquereaffirmed her intention to create a &quot;complete Poland embracing all Polish territories,which  will enjoy the  right when the war is ended of freely regulating  their national,intellectual,  and economic life on a basis of autonomy under the sovereignty of Russiaand of maintaining the principle of a united State &quot;, and  added, &quot; This decision of HisGracious  Majesty  the Emperor  remains unshakable.&quot;   Thereupon  Mr. Asquith  andM. Briand sent a joint telegram referring to the Bussian policy as one whose realisationthey regard  as &quot;a fundamental  element of the future  equilibrium of Europe&quot;.   Thisact of the British and French Premiers in endorsing  the Russo-Polish  solution ofa  united Poland may be said to have internationalised the Polish problem as far asthe Entente Allies are concerned,  and to  have made the Russo-Polish  solution anEntente  war-aim.   Whatever may be the ultimate intentions of the Central Powers,they have already created  a Polish University of  Warsaw,  have  made  Polish  the language of  instruction in all the schools of Russian Poland, have  placed the MunicipalCouncil of Warsaw in the hands  of the Poles,  and have extended  Polish  communalautonomy.    The  Poles  having demanded the nomination of  a  Regent and the summons ofa  Parliament, General Beseler  issued  a further proclamation announcing elections to a Polish  Diet, and then  a third proclamation informing the Poles that their mostardent desire had been  fulfilled  and inviting them to volunteer for the new nationalArmy.   He  added : &quot; The care  for our armies now standing before the enemy obligesus, for the present, to keep the  administration of your new State still  in our hands.&quot;The  German  Chancellor has stated  to  the  Grand  Committee of the Reichstag  thatGermany&apos;s promise was only &quot; conditional&quot; and would not be  fulfilled unless a polish army is  successfully raised.  The  German police have also been forcing  the workingclasses in Poland to accept work in Germany, on lines analogous  to  the Belgiandeportations.   Germany in her present policy  has the support of  the  &quot;Activist&quot;section of the Poles.   The latter, who  are  ardent Russophobes,  worked, in pre-wardays, from the base of Galicia, where, with the encouragement of the Austrians, theyformed legionaries.  At the outset of the war some 4,000 legionaries entered RussianPoland to raise the Poles  against Russia.   The plan was  a  failure, partly owing toinitial  Russian  successes  against  the Austrians.  The &quot; Activists&quot; later  on becameconvinced that an Austrian solution  of the Polish question was impossible and sidedwith the  Germans, in the  hope  that any solution, however inadequate, would, thoughit compromised the principle of Polish unity, face Europe with a fait accompli andforce  on  the &quot;internationalisation of the Polish  problem.  They shut their eyes to thefact that the new  Polish Army cannot  shake itself free from the German commandor take up an anti-German  attitude  should Germany be  true to the  King  of Prussia&apos;straditions and go back on  the  present arrangement.  Their principle is &quot; the bird inthe hand&quot;,  and they trust  that if Germany is badly beaten,  the Entente Powers, atthe final settlement, will  not  revoke  the  liberties they  may  have  obtained  fromPrussia.    Russophil Poles in Russia and the  West have been perplexed by the latest move of the  Teutonic Powers.  They declare there can be no Poland without Galicia, Silesia,Posen, West Prussia, and Dantzig, but the idea  of &quot; independence &quot; has gained groundamong them.&apos;    Napoleon called the Polish question &quot; the pivot of the balance  of power  in Europe &quot;,and it  has been stated that there can be no real peace in Europe until it is satisfactorilysolved.
     The &quot; Kolnische Zeitung&quot; recently stated in  an inspired  leader that Germanyintends to return to Russia the latters Baltic provinces provided Russia accepts thenew state of- things created in Russian  Poland; that by taking away Poland germany is really rendering a service to Russia, as she  thus becomes a united and homogeneousEmpire;  and that,  as  regards  Constantinople, Germany  will never  allow  Russia to possess that city, but that she  is ready to negotiate with  Russia and Turkey as to anarrangement permitting Russian  ships, both men-of-war  and merchantmen,  to pass through the  Straits.  Thus again as in  1772 the Polish and Turkish questions are connected.  If Russia attains her aspirations in the matter of the  Straits, she  can afford  to  be generous  in  the  matter  of territory  in Poland as  in  Armenia.    TheEmperor of Russia&apos;s manifesto to his Army and Fleet of 25th December, 1916, speaksof &quot; the attainment  by Russia of the tasks created by the war the acquisition ofConstantinople and  the Dardanelles, as  well as the creation of a free  Poland fromall  three  of  her now  incomplete  tribal  districts&quot;.   This  further  crystallises  anddefines the Russian policy in the matter.  &quot; Tribal  districts&quot; would  appear to mean the  districts  of Russia, Prussia,  and Austria where  the  Poles form the majority.The real test of the Teutonic Powers&apos; professed regard for the principle of nationalityin the Polish question is  that, if Russia is expected to give up her part of  Poland,Austria should give up  Western Galicia and Germany her Polish provinces  of Silesia,Posen,  and West Prussia.  Presumably Prussia  will not surrender  them unless sheis defeated by the Allies, so that a radical solution of the  Polish problem presupposesthe  defeat of Germany and her Austrian ally.   Germany would like to  get on togood post-war terms with Russia by concessions as to the  Straits, in Armenia  and north Persia in return for a free  hand in  Turkey and Suezwards with  a  view to diminish her land armaments and to  be free to concentrate on destroying the navalsupremacy of Great Britain.  Thus the latters continued existence as an Empire andthe radical solution of the Polish question would seem to be intimately connected, ifnot interdependent.                                  POLAND (2).                       Abstract of letter of 12tli December, 1916.                       [Agence polonaise centrale, Lausanne.]     1. Polish representatives in Parliaments of Berlin and Petrograd  have declared.against the Austro-German proclamation.   The Galician Poles in spite of their loyalty to the Austrian dynasty  have given no  expression of approval.   The Vice-Presidentof the Polish &quot; Club &quot; of Berlin (composed apparently of the Polish representatives inthe Prussian and in the Imperial Parliament) solemnly declared that the Polish nationwas and would remain indivisible,  and  in a secret sitting he expressed his opinionof the proclamation quite  frankly.     2. The opinions of the Polish peoples in the different countries:      GALICIA.   Openly loudly welcome the idea of the extension of Galician autonomy.But the idea of the national committee had always been that of the union of the Polesunder the Austrian  dynasty, making a  tripartite  monarchy.   The  majority  of theinfluential classes maintain an attitude of  &quot; reserve tres critique &quot;.     SILESIA.  There is strong opposition  in Austrian Silesia.     PRUSSIAN POLAND. The people have declared themselves against the proclamationwith  a marvellous  solidarity the  sole  exception  being  a  very small part  of thearistocracy  of Posen, and  they induced the  Archbishop  to  sign, in  a moment of weakness, a letter of thanks to the  Emperor, which he (the Archbishop) now bitterlyregrets.     KINGDOM OP POLAND.   A diversity of opinion.     The majority decided to exploit the proclamation of 5th November &quot; dansle domainesocial, culturel, et national&quot; ; but from the political  point of view, and still  more  fromthe  military, it does not wish to take part against the Entente the Neutralistes, in reality Ententistes, the neutrality being tactical in view of enemy occupation.     The minority accept the proclamation  in principle the Activistes.
    The Activities are made up of various parties :         1. The &quot; Comite national central &quot; Socialist.        2. The &quot; Union nationale des paysans &quot; works among             (a) Radical centres in country districts.             (6) Elementary school teachers.        3. The &quot; Ligue de l&apos;Etat polonais &quot; Austrophil.  Works in Warsaw and chief           provincial towns.  Divided in  its policy.             (a) Some strongly &quot; oppositionnelle &quot;.             (b) Others like those in 2. incline to a compromise with the authorities.  .     The national party, whose only importance comes from the adhesion of certain           landed proprietors.   Policy as 3  (b).    These organisations have created a so-called National Council, which,  however, onlyrepresents a minority of the nation : it consists of 41 representatives of the town ofWarsaw and 40 from the rest of the Kingdom.    The National Council presented the following demands :         1. The creation of a &quot; Conseil d&apos;Etat d&apos;accord avec le Conseil national&quot;.        2. The grant to  the Conseil d&apos;Etat  of, amongst  other things, the  &quot;initiation             des lois &quot; and  the direction of the military department.         3. Convocation of the,Conseil by &amp; joint act of the Central Empires.         4. Proclamation  of a Catholic dynasty friendly to the Poles.             Object-                (a) Extension of powers of Council.               (b) Prevention of subjection of Poland to Germany alone.             Result                New  decree  emanating  from  both  governors-general:   provisional                 council to consist  of  15 representatives  from German  zone  of                 occupation, 10 from the Austrian, to  be named by a decree of  the                 Emperor.    The two chief parties in National Council are bitterly opposed one to  the other:         (a) The national  union of peasants, supports armies of occupation and favours             recruiting even before the realisation of the Polish State.         (b) The  central national committee Socialist more  or less revolutionary              demands first of all a Polish  Government and a free Polish Diet.    They are, however, united by a fanatical hatred of Russia.Neutralists or Ententists.    Since July last have clandestinely flooded the country with flysheets to inform thepublic what it should think of the Austro-German scheme.    Immediately after  the proclamation  the  &quot; democratie nationale du royaume dePologne &quot; passed a resolution which the authorities would not allow to be published inthe Press; this resolution  affirmed that the  Polish nation  looked  for an independent state  embracing all  Polish territories,  and this requirement was not satisfied  by theconstitution of a state composed  of a fragment  of Poland, and  consequently  the&quot; &apos; democratie nationale&apos; disapproved the abandonment of the neutral attitude &quot;.    In  electing to the Duma the &quot; democratie nationale&quot; was  victorious in  nearly every electoral district.    The &quot; Parti realiste &quot;, to whom belongs  five out of the six representatives of  the kingdom  of Poland on the Imperial Council, also passed a resolution to  the effect thatan independent Polish state was the only real solution of the Polish question.    The &quot; Parti progressiste &quot; pronounced  for the maintenance of neutrality.lielations of the two parties.    In  the German zone of occupation the Neutralists keep quite apart from  theActivists, having adopted an attitude of opposition on principle.   In the  Austrian zone,however,  they endeavour  to win over the more  independent minds of the Activists,making use of the aversion of the latter for the Germans ; their tactics are not to reject the proclamation but, by their demands, to make its accomplishment impossible.    The Polish Press in Russia has opposed the Austro-German scheme  and demandeda free Polish state including all Polish territories.
    The Poles in Switzerland have issued a declaration  that the  Polish  nation is one and indivisible,  and that it  looks for a Polish state made up of the three parts  ofPoland.  And the  4,000,000 in the United States  of America have adopted  this declaration.Actual Condition in Occupied Poland.    (1) The Neutralists are persecuted and terrorised, whilst the Activists have a  free           hand.    (2) The want of success of the Entente in the Biilkans, the invasion of- Roumania,           the fruitlessness of the Russian offensive have all  strengthened the hands           of the Activists.    (3) The  situation  is rendered still more grave by the activity of the recruiting           agents.                                            &apos;    (4) The  situation  would be made as complicated as possible  if the Archduke           Charles Stephen were made regent;  he knows Polish and his sympathy for           Poland is known.    (5) This is why the Entente was warned, before the issue of the Austro-German           proclamation, of the necessity of doing something  to thwart the designs of           the Central Powers.The Ritssian Communique of the 15th November.    This has made a bad impression on the Poles.  The Polish &quot; clubs &quot; of the Dumaand  the Imperial Council together with the Polish Committee of  Petrograd  havepublished  a  declaration  in which they  note  with regret that  whilst the RussianGovernment promised  the Poles, at the beginning  of the war, unification  of the Polishterritories, yet in its communique of the 15th November it confined itself to  the promise of an &quot; autonomie nationale,  culturelle et  economique&quot;.   But it  is necessary  toreconstruct a Polish state if the Polish nation is to be assured free development.   TheRussian Government has not yet abrogated the exceptional laws against the Poles.
                        THE QUESTION OP ROUMANIA.     Before Roumania, entered the war on the 27th August the Allies, in great part on french insistence,  accepted, by a  political agreement signed  the  17th August,  herconditions, which, inter alia, included :      (1) her acquisition of the Southern half of Bukovina (recently conquered by the           Russians), the whole of Transylvania, and the Banat up to the river Theiss           with a population of over 6,000,000 and an area of 123,000 sq. kilometres ;     (2) the engagement of the Contracting Powers not to conclude a peace of any kind           without the simultaneous  consent  of  the other parties to the Contract           (Art. 5);     (3) her granting the 300,000  Serbs in the Banat  merely the  right of retaining           their language instead of the ecclesiastical and political autonomy claimed           by them;     (4) the engagement on the part of the Entente Allies not  to  conclude the  war           until all these territorial acquisitions are completely attained by Roumania.     There was no stipulation  concerning the Roumanian population (some 800,000)in Russian Bessarabia, nor as to the Bulgarian population of the strip  of the Dobrujaceded by Bulgaria to Roumania in virtue of the Treaty of Bucarest (10th September,1913) and now reoccupied by Bulgaria.     As regards Germanic war-aims  in Roumania,  it would  appear that, even  if theCentral Powers do not attempt to push  on to  Odessa, they intend, conjointly with bulgaria, to exercise a control over the Danube and its mouths.   By the  capture ofIsakcha  and  Tulcha already they  practically  dominate the St. George and Sulinabranches.     It is interesting to note that the recent German would-be peace proposals toRussia included, according to Rifaat Pasha, ex-Minister  for Foreign  Affairs in Turkey,a suggestion to  partition Roumania, Moldavia going  to Russia and Wallachia to theCentral Powers.    This resembles the  first  partition of Poland in 1772  urged  on russia by Prussia in order to  divert  Russia, then, as now, attacked by Turkey, from constantinople^     The &quot;Frankfurter  Zeitung&quot; recently  stated that the Roumanian political solutionwill be decided by the military solution and  that &quot; every  external solution of theRoumanian question must naturally have as its first condition  the military securityof Germany&apos;s south-eastern front against  Russia.&quot;  This coupled with the  statement that the kernel of future  Balkan policy must include  the incorporation in Bulgariaof the Bulgarian parts of [Serbia  and] Roumania would seem to indicate  the  deter-mination  of the  Central  Powers, unless defeated, to  attribute the  Dobruja  up toTulcha to Bulgaria.    * The Teutonic Powers possibly think such  a plan  feasible if, having produced  the desiredmilitary status  quo,  they  succeed before or during a Conference in splitting the Western Alliesfrom Russia, e. g. over Constantinople, and thus  put Russia  in the  dilemma of  accepting theRoumanian status quo or getting nothing against her colossal sacrifices.
                          COL. PARKERS REPORT.                                                          6th December, 1916.    The two  ships  containing Arab prisoners from India,  the Karadeniz and thePandua, arrived at Rabegh harbour at about 9 a.m.  on the 1st December.    Without delay I went on board both ships,  and saw the Officers Commanding.In both cases I asked to see some of the senior officer prisoners on board.  In the caseof the Pandua a pro-Turk Kurd was  produced, and later a  colourless Baghdadi and aTurk  from Damascus.   It was  not an  encouraging  start.   On the  Karadenis twoBimbashis of unpleasant type and uncompromising attitude were produced,  as well asthe Adjutant,  a  young  German-speaking Albanian student educated at the MilitarySchool, Constantinople.    The beginning did not augur well, nor was it encouraging to hear that the bayonethad been used in  Bombay  to persuade the officers to leave the  train, one officer havingreceived severe wounds in  the head and side.    The only enthusiastic persons who came forward first of all were :  an Egyptianjournalist who, according  to his own account, had been made a prisoner  of war atKuraehi  for no  reason  and appeared somewhat  averse to going on to Egypt; twodoctors, one a Syrian, the  other a Greek,  both Christians ; and a  Kurd who  had been an officer in the  Police at  Baghdad  and was looked upon with contempt and distrustby all, including the  officers with the Arab Army.    The first step was to procure nominal rolls of all the officers, showing their places of origin, as well as the numbers of men in race groups.  The latter  could not be furnished until the next morning.  I therefore proceeded to the shore with the lists ofofficers to consult with Nuri Bey and other officers of the Arab Army.    The same afternoon I took Nuri Bey and some  seven or eight other officers, first to the Pandua and later  on to the Karadeniz.  The meetings and greetings were mostcordial and  affectionate between  the prisoner-officers and the  Arab  Army officers;much coffee was drunk and the talk  went on until 9.30 p.m.  One officer accompanied the shore party to the Camp, and things seemed  to look  bright.   On  the morning ofthe 2nd it was hoped to bring  ail the prisoner-officers from the Pandua to the shore tosee the Sherifs representative&apos; and to hear arguments for the cause  in a  tent pitchedfor the purpose at the Arab landing-place.  Ten came to the shore but the remainderrefused, and of the ten, eight decided to return to the ship the same evening.    In  the  afternoon officers  and men  of the Arab Army were put  on board theKaradeniz to collect recruits, with no success.    On the 3rd  December the Karadeniz was tried systematically and thoroughly.All the officer-prisoners were  first removed from the ship, so that if their presenceinfluenced  in  any way the rank and file their  absence  might assist  recruitment.Sherif Naser, Nuri Bey, Rashid Eff., Tewfik Eff,  Ali Eff, Rahim., and  several other officers of the Arab Army  came on board.    First of all a number  of prisoners were collected whose sympathies, I was assured,lay  with the Arab cause.   It was hoped by this means to obtain a nucleus which  mightreadily swell into larger numbers.  All the men  chosen refused, however, to considerthe question at  all  and stated that they could not  take  service  against their own government, the  Turks.    Next, sections of prisoners were brought up, one section at a time (a section beingabout 50 men), and  addressed by Sherif Naser, Abd El Malik, and the Arab officersof the Arab Army.  These sections were the ordinary discipline  sections, the mennot being classified  by  race in any way.   Several sections were taken until  it was obviously of no possible use,  the men being not  only unwilling but hostile in theirattitude and demeanour.  Another  attempt was made by calling up small  parties ofSyrians,  but this also  met with  failure.  Subsequently and with great  labour  a fewmen singly were  persuaded to join and it seemed  possible that they might bring their friends and that something might be done, but it came to a sudden stop.    As a further possible (sic) seven head men were called up and persuaded by meto go on  a  visit  to  the Arab. Camp on my personal guarantee that they would bebrought back  to  the ship in  any case.   They returned  to the ship next morning,4th December, unpersuaded except one, who had no following.    Since by this time no steps had been left  untried  I notified the S.N.O. that
I had  no further interest  in the Karadeniz and that  she had better proceed on hercourse.     Before she left I had been  again to the Pandua and, with the exception of a fewsingle volunteers, had proved that any further operations wrere hopeless.     The reasons for such a total failure to obtain recruits are not far to seek.  A semi-secrecy was observed in India and the prisoners appear to have been informed first ofall that they were going to a new camp, subsequently being told, presumably after the truth had leaked out, that they would not be compelled to fight for  the Sherif or anyother person.  The manner in which these things occurred, conjoined with the bayonetepisode already mentioned, was calculated to arouse every  suspicion and render thematter incredibly difficult.   Moreover no attempt appears  to  have been made to weedout undesirable officers.     Another cause which has acted very adversely on the whole affair is the fact thatthe prisoners,  with few exceptions so I am told, have masses of money with them inthe case of the men up to several hundreds of rupees, and of the officers up to thousands.They were issued all their arrears of pay in cash before  leaving Sumerpur, and I suggestthat with prisoners  travelling for whatever purpose this is an extraordinary and unde-undesirable thing to do.     A great  number of the prisoners appear to be of low Baghdad type,  and these would  not have been of much military value; nevertheless I  think that, had thepreliminaries  of their  voyage  been  more favourable, a useful number of men wouldhave been obtained ; the more so had there been a well-turned-out body of men on the shore with a man like Aziz El  Masri to inspire them with confidence in  himself andassurances for the future.(Signed)  A.

                  MR. STORRS&apos;S VISIT TO GRAND SHERIP.                                                     H.M.S. Lama,                                                          13th December, 1916.     Jedda. On arrival on Monday the 11th, I went ashore and visited Colonel Wilson.I learnt that  the Sherif  had ridden from Mecca and was  lodged  in the house ofMuhammad Nasif, where  he had  received Colonel Wilson, Captain C. Lloyd, M.P.,Colonel Bremond, and Colonel Barnabi of the Italian Consulate.  The  general situation had been discussed at length, and the Sherif had decided to request H.M. Governmentto send British troops to hold the Rabegh line, a decision upon which he had gone backnext morning.     In the  afternoon, the Sherif  sent his A.D.C. to welcome me, and I  rode with colonel Wilson to the house of Muhammad Nasif, in front of which  was a  dense  andvociferous crowd.     The Grand  Sherif had favourably impressed Colonel Wilson and Captain Lloyd,and I found him a most convincing personality.   After a brief greeting, he led us  intoa small room  and sat  us down on  either side of himself.   He informed me, unasked,that he was sixty-three years of  age  (but  according to R. sometimes admits up tosixty-six).     The dominating  characteristic of the Grand  Sherif is a sincerity of utterance,enhanced by a noble simplicity of demeanour.    I  began by conveying to him  the farewell messages of the High Commissionertogether with all wishes for the final triumph of the Arab cause.  The Sherif in replyexpressed himself as deeply touched by these sentiments, and said that in what part ofthe Empire Sir Henry McMahon might be, he would always think of him with feelings of the sincerest friendship.     Continuing in the same  affectionate strain, and addressing me as &quot; Ya ibny &quot;  (Myson), he embarked upon a  somewhat ample resume of the general position :  the ground of which having  been  already gone  over I contented myself with listening,  interveningonly from  time  to  time,  less to controvert  than  not to let  pass  unchallenged suchcitations as  H.M. Governments  &quot;formal promise  to undertake responsibility  for thedestruction of the Hejaz Railway    It has been my fortune on three separate voyagesto Jedda, to happen each time upon a Rabegh crisis ;  and though the present circum-stances were doubtless graver than  upon other occasions, the chief interest was  to see whether, in the place  of the usual  demands for brigades and batteries, anything in thenature of concerted Arab action would be proposed. No such scheme was forthcoming,but the request for  1,500  Moslem  troops (to hold Rabegh) was explained, justified,  and repeated  although they were &quot; now almost certainly too late to prevent the Turkishadvance &quot;. Wilson had recounted to me his experiences over the question of Aziz Ali&apos;services, warning me that the matter was delicate and should be approached withcaution, and only upon a favourable opportunity.   I had begun to despair of this, whenafter about two  and a half  hours  of criticism and suggestion the Sherif  hinted  hisdisappointment at our not  having designated some able Moslem General to the conductof his  military operations.  I replied that we had never dreamed  of so marked  and direct  an interference in his internal affairs, but that  since he  brought up the  point,I should beg him to excuse a filial frankness in drawing his  attention to the position ofAziz Ali Bey.     It had  been remarked that although H.M.  Government  had supplied close upon60,000 rifles, with munitions and supplies corresponding, to  the Hejaz, no sort of armyappeared to be forthcoming or even in the process of creation, and enabled one to ask whether it would not be possible to  profit by the  enthusiasm and  experience of AzizMasri  by allowing  him an  independent command with a moderate budget so  thathe  might train and equip a nucleus  which, even if unable  to  advance direct uponMedina, would at least close the Southern roads to any Turkish forces that might setout against them.  The Sherifial  Family would naturally retain supreme control of alloperations, and if, as was just conceivable, they laboured under any fear that Aziz  Beyhad not changed his  Committee spots and  might set himself up  as Enver (or evenbetray them to the Turks), let them remember that so long as they held the  purse,they could by  shutting it  render him powerless whenever  they pleased.  The  Sherifinquired if Aziz Bey carried the recommendation of H.M. Government.   I referred
him to the Sirdar&apos;s last telegram on the subject, and he was silent for a moment; then he said, with a  certain air of decision,&apos; &quot; Do  not  think  that  we have  anything butadmiration for Aziz Bey ; I declare to you that I hereby appoint  him Minister  of Warwith an independent budget  for his requirements.&quot;   I said that I trusted that  thisappointment would not mean  removal from the front, the only place where Aziz couldbe of use.  The  Sherif admitted this and offered to allow him to remain at the front,choosing a representative who  should act for him in  the matter of transport, supply, &amp;c,at Mecca; the salary of the said  representative to be paid by the Sherif.  We  con-sidered this  decision as most favourable both in itself and as a sign of  the  Sherifsreasonableness and good intentions.   He undertook to send off the necessary telegramof appointment next morning, and will, I  feel sure, do his best to abide  loyally by thearrangement.   It being by this time past  nine o&apos;clock, and our interview having lastedjust over thi-ee hours, we withdrew, promising to meet him again next morning.     I called  upon the Sherif next  morning and spent another two  hours  in  hiscompany.  Having just received encouraging  letters from  his three sons, he viewed the  situation in general under a much more rosy light than on the previous evening.He sent for his private secretary, dictated  then and there  the telegram of appointment to Aziz Bey, and, strong in this proof of  his bonne volonte, embarked upon a variety ofrather petty grievances, coupled with harmless if  impracticable suggestions.   He is,for example, far  from  satisfied with the person of Paroki as his Cairo  representative and wishes  to appoint  another, whom we are at liberty to  choose, in his place.  Hewas anxious, moreover, as had been Abdalla at our  last interview, to establish a privatecypher directly between himself and the  Residency.  I am convinced that both theserequests were made  from what he considers a sense of fitness and reciprocity  and -not  in the least  from  any  lack of confidence in, or appreciation of,  Colonel Wilson,with whom his relations are  obviously of a most cordial  nature.  He subsequentlyfavoured me with an explanation, unsolicited, of the reasons for his assumption of theregal title.   These consisted  chiefly in the necessity for encouraging the feeling  of independence and freedom from  interference in  the various  tribes (and I was  sub-sequently informed by Colonel  Wilson  that  the   declaration  has,  in  this, respect,produced  a good impression).  I suggested that Abdalla  might have  let  us  know,before taking so  momentous  a step ;  and he replied that as he had  already been officially addressed by the  Residency as Khalifa (a title to which he  did  not  aspire),he had considered that, the greater  including the less, it was superfluous to  appriseus  of his resolution.   I remarked that though  all the Residency correspondence to himself had passed through my hands, I had never yet seen the  document he quoted;but being well aware, from previous experience with  Abdalla, that he would at onceoffer to produce it from Mecca.  Before leaving I arranged to return on my way downto the ship.   This I did at  2.30, taking with me the Staff-Surgeon of H.M.S. Bufferin,who is an expert  photographer, in the hope of securing a portrait.  The Sherif refusedat first to pose, and instead desired me to make various inquiries as to  the  nature ofa  small scar (which he was unable to show) upon his left knee.   When I objectedand  offered  to leave the room to ensure  his greater  privacy he gave me something approaching a wink and said, &quot; I only asked from civility.&quot;   As he had remarked thathe was of course unable to prevent people snapshotting him,  I directed  the Staff-Surgeon to take a couple straight  off as he sat;  and the involuntary sitter underwentthe ordeal with a remarkable  sang-froid.  On  my departure he handed me a letter forthe High Commissioner, embraced me twice, and escorted me to the staircase; at thesame time sending with me his A.D.C. and his private  secretary to accompany meon board the Dufferin.     Tenbo. We  reached Yenbo  the next  day, and  I  advised Sherif  Faisal thatI proposed visiting him at about 9.  I gathered that the state of things  in and aboutYenbo was not satisfactory.  The Turks were within 15 miles of  the town&apos;, and mighthave attacked that very night.  Monitor M.31 (of  whose  arrival, by the way, ColonelWilson had not  been  advised)  was standing  close in to bombard them in  case of necessity.  The aircraft vessel Raven was at Sherm  Yenbo, and the seaplanes had been quite recently bombing the Turks.  I gather that the single trench, though technicallyan indifferent achievement, yet covered the plain across which the Turks must advance.By the 12th there was a regular panic ashore, and many notables,  including Faisal,  hadboarded H.M.S. Rardinge.  The Turks, moreover, were reported closer still some saidwithin six miles and  in greater  numbers than hitherto suspected.   The Arabs  hadabsolutely declined to hold the trench and were hoping that the ship&apos;s guns  would command the plain; a peculiarly absurd idea,  seeing that the presence of a force
                                                              Iholding the trench,  however badly, would be the only possible means whereby the  ,,ships could locate an advancing force until it were right inside the town itself.     I visited Sherif Faisal about 9.15.  The notice I had given him  had apparentlyenabled him to  crowd on every inch  of silk  in  Yenbo, but I was immensely struckwith his personal appearance, which in fact realises that of the legendary noble Arab.He was slightly thinner than I  had been led to suppose, and I am informed that the anxieties of the last two months  have  really worn him down  considerably.  Hisyoungest brother, Zeid Bey, was with  him.  Sherif Faisal, whose mien is that of onechastened by failure, reiterated the complaints he had made to Captain  Lawrenceas to our delay  in  supplying the  artillery requested  four months ago.  He admitted that nothing was to be gained by  enlarging upon this grievance, and I pointed out to him  that, after the  recent  retreats, the courage of his  Arab tribesmen stood insome need of vindication  in  the eyes of the world; even if they were unable to facetheir foes  in the open field, their intimate  knowledge of their own mountainouscountry would render them redoubtable in guerrilla warfare.  Sherif faisals first andlast request was  that the British should guarantee him the  possession of Rabegh andYenbo; with these  two as  bases upon which to fall back he would  not hesitate to advance again upon the Turks and to take Wejh; it was the dread  of being cut  off.that paralysed his strength.  Before leaving I informed him of his father&apos;s  decisions with regard to Aziz  Ali and adjured him very earnestly to put his entire  confidence.in this  officer, whose one  object was the success  of the Arab cause and with it thetriumph of the  Sherifial  Family.   He promised with  every appearance of sincerityto work loyally with Aziz, and 1 left him strong in these protestations  at about 10.15 ;rejoining  H.M.S. Lama, which  sailed for Suez at 11.80 a.m.  and i-reached it  at noon on Friday, the 15th.     The incoherent  and spasmodic nature of  Arab organisation and operations is  anadditional proof, if such were needed, of the necessity of one supreme and independentcontrol  of the campaign; and as there appears to be no  other Moslem  that  unites thevarious  qualifications of Aziz Ali Bey,  it is to  be  hoped that the Sherif will have the courage and self-restraint to make his appointment a reality.

With all respect and honour, I  offer    to Your Excellency my sincerity and my absolute devotion.

1318    RUSSIAN TERRITORIES IN  THE OCCUPATION OF GERMANY AND                         RUSSO-GERMAN  RELATIONS.  [Written for Field-Marshal von Hindenburg  by Geheimrat Sering, a Professor at the                                Berlin University.]     The  following are some  of the  salient points on the subject of Kurland and lithuania in the report by Professor Sering of Berlin University as to the conqueredterritories  north-east  of  Germany  and relative to  the political  relations between germany and  Russia.  The report  appears to be dated the  21st  September, 1915.It is divided into four portions, the first two of which, as already stated, are heresummarised, while the third  section in regard to Poland, and section four  entitled&quot; German Political Considerations &quot;  are given in full translation.     1. Kurland. The writer emphasises the importance to Germany of this conqueredterritory owing to the fact that it  forms a link in  evangelical countries which withrare breaks reaches  from  Holstein to  Finland and  Sweden.   Community  of faithconstitutes here a  strong political instinct.   The standard and character of civilisationin Kurland and in Livonia and Esthonia  are to  this  day  almost  entirely German.This was noticed by the German soldiery as soon as they entered the province, wherethey  received a cordial welcome from the landowners, the clergy, and  the  Germanpeasantry.  The attempted Russification of Kurland which was undertaken  in the&quot;eighties&quot; was stoutly resisted by the German inhabitants and had the unexpected effectof rallying the German national elements.  The proportion of Germans in the  popula-tion of Kurland is about 10  per cent., the  total  population  having been estimated in 1897 at 674,000.   In the opinion  of the writer, the theory put forward by ProfessorHoetzsch of Berlin University in regard to  the hatred of the  Letts for the Germansis entirely without foundation.   The writer  proceeds to  divide the  Lett  population into  three categories   the peasants, the labourers, and the educated classes.     The writer advocates the introduction  of a  German. peasant  class and describes the efforts of the  large German landowners in supporting such a policy.   He reckonsthat two or three decades would suffice to convert Kurland into a genuine Germanpossession  provided that a continuous and determined policy of  colonisation  werepursued.   It would also  be urgently necessary to develop the agricultural land andthe railways, which  would result in  a  considerable accession of agrarian supply toGermany.  For the above reasons the writer strongly urges the retention by germany of this province or the insistence of its total cession in the peace negotiations.     2. Lithuania. The report then deals with Lithuania, including the governmentof Kovno, the  greater portion  of  Vilna,  Suwalki, and Grodno.   The  writer  thendescribes  the racial,  territorial, and religious conditions of  the province and  draws attention to the power of the Roman  Catholic priesthood, to whose efforts is  due thefailure of the Russian attempts of oppression.  The priesthood, according to the writer,are ardently desirous of the incorporation of Lithuania in the German Empire on theground that Germany observes the principles  of religious toleration in her treatmentof Roman  Catholics.   Lithuania desires to be freed  by Germany  from both Polish and  Russian domination.  In  advocating the annexation of this province, the writerrecommends the expropriation or deportation of both the Russian and Polish territorialnobles against indemnity either in money  or  estates  situated elsewhere.   In hisopinion, the properties so liberated  would  be specially suited  to donations in favourof the German generals who have  distinguished themselves in the campaign.  the sections on the subject of Poland and on the general political situation are textuallyas follows:      3. Poland. It is not  possible to deal in detail with the Polish question here.  Itis evidently out  of the  question that  Poland should  ever  be made into  a Germanprovince.   It would only be possible to bestow upon  a free Polish nation an externalcommunication with  Germany.   But care must be taken  to preserve the military strength of the country for the service of Germany and to effect a  connection between poland and the economical markets of Germany.     The statement is often quoted that Poland is an industrial State which would loseits means of existence if the industry of the country were to forfeit its Russian market.
 This statement is incorrect.  Eighty pei\cent, of Poland is genuine agricultural land, with a numerous population in the proportion, roughly speaking, of 112 to the square, kilometre.  Consequently, it may  be regarded as  over-populated in proportion to the primitive state of cultivation prevailing there.  For this reason it would be desirable to include in  Poland a portion of the conterminous territories of- White Russia on&apos; the  eastern  boundary.   The  peasants in the  latter districts  would necessarily be compelled, like the White Russian settlers in the east of the province of Vilna, to sell their holdings.     4.  General Political  Considerations. The proposal to deprive Russia of extensive territories has encountered the  objection that such a policy would  render tolerable political relations with Russia permanently impossible.  Professor Hoetzsch of Berlin University has expressed this view in his report.   The reply to this contention is that the  sole real guarantee for peace is to  be found  in an equilibrium of the military and economic strength as between the two countries.     The Russia of to-day is superior as regards population to the two Central Empires combined  by  46 per cent. (175,000,000  to  120,000,000),  and this superiority will show an unbroken increase if  the  territorial situation is to be left unchanged.  In the year 1930 Russia will possess twenty-five  millions  of 20-year  old  male inhabitants, whereas in Germany and Austria-Hungary  combined there will  be   only thirteen millions of such men at that date. With  the fall in the birth-rate the maximum of valid males in Germany will  be reached  in  the  years  1927-1928 with  a figure of 7,720,000, and exclusive  of Austria-Hungary will  show an inferiority of 50 per cent. to the figure reached in Russia.     On the other hand,  the development of the Western Powers will appear to be even less formidable.   Fifteen years hence France,  Great Britain and Italy combined will not possess as many valid  males as the two Central Empires combined.     The fact  must also not be lost sight of that the quality of the  Russian troops will improve.   It  must be remembered that the  peasants of Great Russia still retain the mediaeval characteristics of a creature inseparable from the soil and barely  capable of responsible thought and action.  But the  agrarian reforms  initiated by Stolypin in 1906 and  1911  which  introduced  the  gradual  disappearance  of the  system of common property, and by applying the principle of private property supplied the chief condition for the free development of the individual, will rapidly increase the capacity and  output of the Russian in every branch of life and will bring him dangerously near to the standard of Central and  Western Europe.     There is one expedient only by which the equilibrium of forces can be established as between Germany and Russia, namely the emancipation  from Russian  domination of the foreign elements in the population  which properly belong to Western  civilisa- tion. It is for strategists to determine the  best  frontier  line  which will secure for Germany permanent protection  against Russia.  .  . . The territory to be  taken from Russia would embrace 420,000  square kilometres or four-fifths of the  superficies of Germany with a present population of  24 million souls, including Finland 28 millions. Russia would  thereby lose one-sixth of her present population.     If  such  a change were to be successfully brought  about in the interests of the Central Empires, the power of Russia would thereby  be diminished  by one-third.     No  doubt the ceded territory would include on its eastern boundary countless inhabitants of White Russia and it would be necessary to deport these for the duration of the war.  This would be no  more than an  equitable reprisal for the measures taken against  the German settlements in  Russia whereby the  greater number  of these have been compelled to liquidate their property and to leave the district.  The expropriation of White Russians would not  be a difficult measure as  their proprietary instincts of ownership are less developed  than in the case of peasant  proprietors in Central and western Europe.     It is also  evident that Russia would be incapable of raising a large war indemnityin specie.  This should therefore be made payable in the form of territory.     If the military situation permits, it would be most desirable to draw Livonia andEsthonia into the German sphere of power, as these provinces could, in a  short time,be converted  into  pure German territory by the simplest methods as in the caseof Kurland.

ARABIA.                          Hejaz.                     Summary of News.    The  Turkish forces  are  not reported to have  made anyprogress towards  Rabugh or Yambo during the past week.  Onthe 9th  they were holding the  wells at Hafah (where our planeshave bombed them), on the Gara road, too  strongly for SidiAlito attack them, and, accordingly  he has left  Umm Beirak andgone across to Abu JDhibaa, just south  of  Modhiq  on the FaraRoad  ; here a reinforcement of  150 men,  with two  guns, hasbeen sent  up to him.  He has  apparently left a lieutenant, whosename  reaches us in various perversions, and should, perhaps,  beIbn Arbij, chief of several clans  of the Beni Amr Harb, to watch the Gara road.   An unconfirmed report  says  that  some of theBeni  Salim,  influenced by  Husein Mubeirik, the Zobeid chief,who has  come down  from Medina, have  defected ;  but other information  tells us that Husein  has no following.    Feisal may be by  now at Umlejh, whence he proposes  tomove on Wejh.   Abdullah is acting in concert with him, and isreported to be moving on  Abul  Nairn, a station  on  the  Hejazrailway, about eighty miles north of Medina,  with  no less than6,000 camelry.   Feisal has made an unsuccessful surprise attackon the outpost at Dhifran, put out west of  Hamra by  the  Tui&apos;ksto guard the road from  was it.   With its 300 men and machine-guns it  was too strong  for him.  The Turks have experiencedsome  reverse, probably in connection with an outpost, in theneighbourhood of their expeditionary base  at Bir Dervvish ; but its nature and extent are not ascertained.  We know them also tohave a great and  increasing number of sick at  Medina, and to bevery shown -t of some essential supplies.   Their aeroplanes seem tobe doing nothing ; two, if not three of them are certainly out ofaction, and one of their  pilots  has been killed.  Prisoners have informed us of the  following distribution of elements  of the hejaz Expeditionary Force.   Of the 55th Regiment,  the secondbattalion  and  the  first  half - battalion  with  mountain - gunsand two  field-guns are at Hamra ; the fourth battalion is atBir Abbas ; and the third is at Bir Derwish.   There is a  CamelCorps Regiment south of Hamra.  Some of the 129th  Regiment,are apparently at  Bir Raha ; and the 42nd  Regiment is  still inthe Ghayir district.    It is to  be hoped that the  Hail  caravan, carrying L.T. 6,000towards Kerbela,  which Basra reports  has been intercepted  bySaud  es-Subhan,   was  taking  the wherewithal to  buy freshsupplies  for  Medina.   If  so, its  loss will be  serious  for theTurks, who are short of cash in Hejaz.
                           Nejd.                         Ibn Saud.     The  visit to Basra  of lbn  Saud,  on  November 27, was an  episode  in the Mesopotamian campaign  no less picturesqueto  the onlookers than  it  was  significant  to  those  who  have studied the course of Arabian politics.  For the past century thehistory of  the interior  of  the  peninsula  has centred round the rivalry  between the Emirs of Northern and Southern Nejd,Ibn Rashid and  Ibn  Saud.   When  Abdul Aziz,  the presentrepresentative  of the  house of  Saud,  was a  boy  of  fifteen,the power of the Rashid touched  its zenith ; the great EmirMohammed, Doughty&apos;s  grudging host,  drove  the  Saud intoexile  and occupied  their  capital,  Riyadh.   For  eleven yearsAbdul Aziz ate the bread of adversity, but in 1902, the  Sheikhof  Kuweit, on the Persian  Gulf,  himself at enmity with  theRashid, saw in the young Emir  a promising weapon  and  gavehim his  chance.   With  a force of some  eighty camel  riderssupplied by Kuweit, Abdul Aziz swooped down upon  Riyadh,surprised  lbn Rashid&apos;s  garrison, slew his  representative andproclaimed  his own  accession from  the  recaptured city.  the story  of  his  bold adventure  is  part  of  the stock-in-trade  ofBedouin reminiscence the  arrival of the tiny band at dusk  inthe palm-gai-dens  south of the town, the halt till nightfall, thescaling  of the palace wall  by  Abdul Aziz and  eight  pickedfollowers,  the  flash  of   steel  which  roused and silenced  thesleeping foe and, at dawn, the throwing open of the city gates tothe comrades of the victor.     The struggle was not over with the capture of Kiyadh.   Ina contest, renewed year  after year,  Abdul  Aziz  recovered  the territories of  his fathers  and made  for himself a name whichfilled the echoing deserts.   At  length,  in  1913,  his  restlessenergy  brought  him into fields  of wider political importance.He seized the Turkish  province of Hasa, formerly an appanageof  Riyadh,  ejected  the  Ottoman  garrisons  and establishedhimself on the seaboard of the Persian Gulf.   He was already  on terms of personal friendship with  Captain Shakespear, our PoliticalAgent at  Kuweit, and  nothing was  more certain than that hisappearance on the coast must ultimately  bring him into  direct contact with Great Britain ; but  before the difficult question  ofhis precise relationship to Constantinople had been adjusted, theoutbreak of war with Turkey released us from  all obligation to preserve a neutral attitude.   In the winter of 1914-15,  CaptainShakespear  made  his way for the second  time into Nejd andjoined Ibn  Sand who was  marching north to repel the attack of Ibn  Rashid,  engineered  and backed by the Turks.   The twoforces met in Sedeir in an indecisive engagement in which  CaptainShakespear, though  he was  present as  a  non-coinhatant, waswounded  and killed.  We lost in  him a  gallant officer whoseknowledge  of  Central  Arabia and rare  skill in handling  the tribesmen marked him out for a useful and distinguished career.His deeds have lived after him.
    Ibn SaucTs connection with us has received public  confirm-ation in a durbar of  Arab sheikhs  held, at Kuweit on November20,  where  he   was invested with  the  K.C.I.E.    On  thatmemorable occasion  three  powerful   Arab chiefs,  the  Sheikhof Muhammerah, who, though a Persian  subject is of Arab stock,the Sheikh of  Kuweit and Ibn Saud, Hakim of Nejd, stood side by side in amity and concord, and  proclaimed  their adherence tothe British cause.   In  a  speech as spontaneous  as  it  wasunexpected, Ibn Saud  pointed out that,  whereas the ottoman government  had sought  to  dismember  and  weaken the  Arabnation, British policy aimed at uniting and strengthening their leaders, and the  Chief Political Officer, as  he  listened to words which will be  repeated and discussed round every camp fire, musthave looked back on  years of patient work in the Gulf, and  seenthat they were good.  ,    Ibn Saud is  now barely forty, though he looks some yearsolder.   He is  a man  of splendid physique, standing well  over sixfeet, and carrying himself  with  the air  of one accustomed to command.   Though  he is more massively built than  the typicalnomad -sheikh, he has the characteristics  of the  well-bred Arab,the strongly  marked  aquiline   profile,  full-fleshed   nostrils,prominent lips arid long, narrow chin,  accentuated by a  pointedbeard.   His hands are  fine, with slender  fingers,  a  trait almostuniversal among the tribes of pure Arab blood,  and,  in  spite ofhis great height and  breadth  of  shoulder,  he  conveys  theimpression,  common  enough in the  desert,  of  an  indefinablelassitude, not&apos;individual  but racial, the  secular weariness of anancient and self-contained people, which  has made heavy draftson its  vital  forces,  and borrowed little from beyond  its  ownforbidding frontiers.   His deliberate movements, his  slow, sweetsmile, and the  contemplative glance  of  his  heavy-lidded eyes,though they add to his dignity and charm, do not accord  withthe Western conception of a  vigorous personality.  Nevertheless,report credits  him with powers of physical endurance rare  evenin hard-bitten Arabia. &apos; Among men bred in the  camel-saddle, heis said to have  few rivals  as  a  tireless rider.  As a leader ofirregular forces he is of proved daring, and he combines  with hisqualities as a  soldier that grasp of statecraft  which is yet more highly  prized by the tribesmen.   To  be  &quot;a  statesman&quot; is,perhaps, their final word of commendation.     Politician, ruler and raider,  Ibn Saud illustrates a historictype.    Such men as he  are  the  exception in any  community,but they are thrown up persistently by the Arab race in its ownsphere, and in that sphere they meet its  needs.   They furnishedthe conquerors and military administrators of the Mohammedaninvasion, who were  successful just where Ibn   Saud, if he hadlived  in a more primitive age, might  have succeeded or failed,(just as in a smaller field he may  fail), in the task  of  creatingout of a society  essentially tribal, a united and homogeneous stateof  a  durable  nature.    Mohammed  el-Rashid  was  the classicexample in the generation  before our own.  He has been dead
twenty years,  but his fame  survives.   Like him Abdul Aziz.has drawn the loose mesh of tribal organization into a centralizedadministration   and  imposed on  wandering confederacies  an authority which, though fluctuating, is recognized as a  politicalfactor.  The Saud have, in the palm-groves of Riyadh and oasesof their northern and. eastern provinces, Qasim and Hasa, widerresources, greater wealth and  a larger settled population  than theRashid,  and their  dominion rests, therefore, on  a  more  solidfoundation ;  but the ultimate  source  of  power,  here, as in thewhole  course   of  Arab history,  is  the  personality   of thecommander.  Through  him,  whether he  be  an  Abbasid Khalifor  an Emir of Nejd, the  political  entit3&apos; holds, and  with hisdisappearance it breaks.     If the  salient  feature  of the  Kuweit  durbar  was  the recognition by  the assembled Arab chiefs  of the good will ofGreat  Britain  towards  their  race,  it was the  presence  of  anunchanging  type  of  desert  sovereignty, among  conditions somodern that they had scarcely grown familiar to those who createdthem, which  gave Ibn  Saud&apos;s  visit to  Basra its distinctive colour.In the course of a few hours the latest machinery of offence wasparaded  before  him.   He  watched the  firing of  high explosivesat an  improvised trench and  the bursting of anti-aircraft shellsin  the clear heaven above.  He travelled by a railway not sixmonths old and sped  across  the desert in a motor-car to the battle-field of Shaaibah, where he inspected British infantry and indian cavalry, and witnessed a battery of  artillery come into action.  In one  of the  base hospitals,  housed  in a palace  of our good friend the  Sheikh of Muhammerah, he was shown the bonesof his own hand under the R6ntgen ray.   He walked along thegreat wharfs on the  Shatt-el-Arab, through  the heaped storesfrom which an army is clothed and fed, and saw an aeroplane climbup  the empty sky.   He looked at all these things  with  wonder,but the interest  which he displayed in the mechanism of Warfarewas that of a man who seeks  to  learn, not of one who standsconfused,  and unconsciously he justified  to the officers who werehis  hosts the reputation he has gained in  Arabia for sound senseand distinguished bearing.    &quot; It is good for  us&quot; said the  Sheikh of Muhammerah, asthe two  chiefs  took  their  leave, &quot; to see your might.&quot;   Thosewho heard him may well have found  their thoughts reA^erting toa might greater and more  constant than that of the  War Lord,and  looked forward to the  day  when   we  shall  expound the science of peace  instead of the science of destruction.G.

SYRIA.                   South Palestine I.    The  following  information concerning  the area betweenGaza Bir Saba and  the  Turet?-Egyptian  Boundary may be ofinterest:     This area falls  into four fairly  clearly  defined divisions.    1.   Along the coast from El-Arish to Rafah and Gaza runs adeep belt of sand dunes  fully three miles in depth between Rafaand Khan Yunis,. but narrowing .to about  a quarter of a mile in depth near Deir el-Belah, after which  it again widens to a depth of about two miles south of Gaza.  Except at Deir el-Belah andat the  mouth of the  Wadi Ghuzzah, this belt of sand dunes isa  serious obstacle to  movement inland from Egypt.   On theother hand  the fact  that water is  found  in  fair quantities  all along  the fore-shore at  the  foot of these  dunes  from  Deirel-Belah to Rafah and thence in still greater quantities to El-Arish,encourages caravans in  normal times to leave the ordinary road,general^ known  as  the  Darb el-Sultani,, at,Deir el-Belah andfollow the shore to El-Arish.   This route also has the advantage that it is less liable  to  visits from Egyptian or Turkish coast-guards or gendarmes.     2.   South of the greater part of the sand dune belt is  an areaof sparsely  cultivated open grass land, giving  excellent camelgrazing  in  the spring,  and  furnishing no obstacle, with theexception of the Wadi Ghuzzah, to movement of wheeled traffic,except after heavy rain, when the clay, of which certain ai&apos;eas init are composed, tends to become extremely sticky.  This openarea is mostly of the  shape of an isosceles triangle, its apex close to the  frontier, its base on the line of the  Gaza-Bir Saba  road.Its water is good on the whole in proximity  to the dune  area.There  are good wells at Rafah  ; the  supply  of water at KhanYunis, Beni Selah and Deir el-Belah is unlimited, while the  Wadiel-Ghuzzah  often runs in  spate in winter, and  contains  poolswhich  last long into the summer in  the driest years.  The lineof wells south-Avest of the Wadi el-Ghuzzah follows, and doubtlessexplains the line  taken by  the. Darb el-Sultani High Road  from palestine to Egypt.   There are several elements of cultivation atRafah, whilst between the frontier and Gaza there  is a certainamount of garden cultivation, as well as the usual  barley and wheat  fields  of  the drier parts  of  Southern  Palestine.   TheBedouins too  sow  parts  of this  area, but  depend for waterentirely  on the winter rains.  West of the Wadi el-Ghuzzah, thewhole  of this area south of the chain  of wells  along the  HighRoad is waterless for the greater part  of the year, and occasionalpools,  formed after heavy winter rains,  soon  disappear into thelight  and rather sandy  soil.    On the other hand, between  Wadieh Ghuzzah  and  the Gaza-Bir Saba  road, there are a  certainnumber  of old cisterns which are still used for water storage bythe Nomad population, and water lies, apparently throughout the
year, in large pools  in  the  Wadi  close  to  Shellal,  the  one point above the Gaza crossing where the Wadi el-Ghuzzah canbe used by wheels without the slightest difficulty.     3.   South of this triangular area of steppe or veldt is a widebelt of sand-hill country.   Its northern boundary  is  represented by a line, point  315 on the Turco-Egyptian  Boundary-El-Abreisa Bir Saba.   It falls roughly into two sub-regions ; thefirst  and northern  sub-region,  o   varying width, is composedmainly of small hard sand-hills,  which are prominent features, orin  process of becoming  so, and are often  covered  with,  andbound by  scrub.    There  are  patches  of  cultivation  (chieflybarley)  in  many  places  among  these harder sand-hills, and theypresent as a rule no great  obstacle to movement from east to west.  Further  south comes  the sub-region of  much  higher,softer, and more numerous sand dunes, running generally east and west, and  often  shifting  their positions.   These  dunes arecontinued west of the Turco-Egyptian  boundary to near El-Arish.  They are pierced  by several  routes, passable  for packanimals, and a few, e.g. three parallel  roads running eastwardstowards Rafah from El-Arish and uniting in the Darb el-Sultaniroad  near  Sheikh  Zowaid, which are passable by wheels.   Thearea is  practically waterless, except after the  heaviest rain, and movement through it from north to south against  the  set ofthe dunes is  difficult and  fatiguing.     4.   South again of  the inland sand  dune area  comes a beltof limestone country marked by a chain  of hills running north-east and south-west to meet  the  Gebel Helal range  west of El-Auja.  This  strip is passable  in  many places, and has a fewreally good springs and wells, e.g. at El-Aujah, Ruafah, Asluj,.etc.Its height is from 800 to 1,000  feet  above  the sea  level on anaverage, the surface is fairly smooth, and the slopes of the hills arefairly easy,  while large patches of  hard sand or gravel plain,established in the neighbourhood of El-Aujah, could be negotiated by motor cars.   A  railway and a good  motor road have been constructed  without any difficulty  through  this  area  by theTurks.   There is a little cultivation in  the wadis, and remains of old settlements  give  the impression  that this region couldsupport&apos;a small sedentary population.   The road from El-Aujahto Bir Saba marks about the limit of relatively passable country.Further east comes  a complex of broken  limestone hills andravines,  a  southward extension of  the wilderness  of Judaea,which rises to the east and then falls in a series of steep scarp-ments into the Wadr Arabah.     Gaza is a considerable town, one of the largest in Palestine,lying in a rich  belt of cultivation behind a line of  sand-dunesthat protect it from the sea.  The town, which is without wallsor gates, is surrounded with fruit and vegetable gardens boundedby hedges of prickly pear.   The population is anything between
 20,000 and  40,000,  and.&apos;. is  almost  entirely Moslem.   The Christians, mostly  Greek orthodox, are said. to. number 1,000. There is no such Jewish Colony, as exists in most other Palestine towns.  The  head  of the municipality  is one hay  Said  Effendi Sbawa, aged  forty, a large property owner, who though forced to keep  in with  the; Turks  is reported to  have pro-British sympathies.  The  Mufti was until  recently one Ahmed Effendi, a cousin of Shukri  Effendi Husseini of. Jerusalem and Constant!- nople, whom  the Kiblah states (December, 1916,) to have been recently exiled and imprisoned by  the  Turks.  Ahmed  Effendi co-operated  with  our Consular Agent  at  the  beginning  of, the war in influencing the Arabs in  our  favour and in preventing their  active co-operation with the Turks.   He is  said to have been removed to Jerusalem in  1916.   Most of the influential Moslems  of Gaza  are reported  to be  anti-Turk, viz.  Ahmed Effendi  Surani   and his  brother Mohammed ; Hussein  Effendi Khawal   and his   son  Husni ;  Arif  el-Mufti,   ex-M.P.  for Gaza ;  all  property  owners.   The  leading  Moslem  merchant family is that of  Bissesso.  Abdul Hassan  Bissesso and Khalil Effendi  Bissesso, aged thirty-seven and forty respectively, are also reported  as being discontented with  the  Turks.   Among the  Christians the most prominent native of  Gaza  is said  to be one  Farah Iskander Farah.  There are a  number  of grain- merchants in  Gaza, who used to buy from all the  surrounding district,   and among  these  may   be   mentioned   Salahi  Abu Ramadan and Khalil el-Ghalazini  el-Kebir, both Moslems ;  also Shibli  el-Tarazi, Yakub and Yusef  el-Sayegh,  and  Bishara Shebebar, Christians.   A  German,  named Jacob Schmidt,  is reported to be important in Gaza.   He  has been settled there for some: years and  owns a flour-mill.  He has acquired property  at Esdud (ancient  Aslvdod) on the Gaza-Jaffa road, where he keeps an hotel and  has the only flour-mill.      Bir  Saba  is  a Bedouin  centre established about ten years ago by the  Turkish Government.   Before that date, the Bedouins had  to  take  their  cases and disputes  to  Gaza, where they were mulcted  by  the Effendis,  and. never   got  satisfaction.   They accordingly  demanded  Home Rule,  and  this   demand   wass favorably  regarded by  the  Mutesarrif  of Jerusalem.   Bir Saba was  selected  as the  site of  the new  Bedouin Court, where all cases are  brought and decided by the Bedouin Kadhis, recognized by  the  Turkish Government.  Hamad  es-Sufi of the Terabin, was  selected  as Chief Judge and  was made Reis el-Beladiyah (Mayor), and with  him were associated  fourteen  other judges, representing  the various tribes.   Bir  Saba has a more or less permanent  population of about 800 souls,  and  contains the only stone houses in  the  district.   The  tribes  around,  must be regarded as  semi-nomadic, i.e. the  men wander.when they have camels,  but  their families  remain on  patches of: cultivation which are  held by&quot;  traditional right, by the/various  clans. Between  Bir Saba and  Gaza, the  cultivation is  more or  less continuous, while to the  south and  east, it becomes  more  and
more pocketty.  Between Bir  Saba and  the villages south ofHebron is a  sparse and unruly population.  Most of the tribesround  Bir Saba live in tents or straw shelters; they rarely havebuilt  houses,  and  their  camels and  herds  are  not numerous.Gaza people seem to have an altogether exaggerated view, of  thenumber of men and camels at the command of Hamad es-Sufi.    Immediately  round  Bir   Saba are  the  Terabin  (Hamades-Sufi).   Between Bir  Saba and  the  Dead Sea are found  theThulam, whose sheikh  is  Selim Abu Irbeia, an intelligent man with influence over his people, who number about 2,000 souls.North  of  him live  the small tribe of  Jahalan.  South-west ofBir Saba,  in the Khalasa district, live  the Azazma.   The)&apos; havethree principal Sheikhs, Suleiman Abu Asa, Audeh Abu Zawarba,and  Bl-Muzazel.   The last-named is  also  connected with  theTiaha tribe, who live west of Bir  Saba, between  .this place andGaza.    Hamad es-Sufi, who, since: the establishment of  Bir  Saba,has obtained  a more or less paramount position, is an  old man o seventy.  His own particular tribe  is the Najamet section of  theTerabin.  His son Jadira,  age thirty, has  no  great influenceoutside his sub-tribe, and has a blood feud with the Abu Sittah,another section of  the Terabin.   At the beginning of the war,Hamad es-Sufi was active in assisting Turkish  propaganda, butit is reported that  last winter he became disaffected, and declined to put his men into  Turkish uniform.   Associsixion  betweenArabs,  especially  Bedouin Arabs,  and Turks  usually ends inmutual dislike  and distrust.   Both think  themselves  raciallysuperior to the other, and this belief engenders  a  hostility whichis intensified by  difference   of  social  habits  and  traditions.Among the other judges associated with Hamad  es-Sufi  at  BirSaba  are  Abu  Abdun,   Ali el-Atawneh, Abu llekkayik,  AbuGhalian, Freh Abu Middein mostly oldish men of  the  usualBedouin type.                          NOTES.Mill?. Kurds.     News has reached us from Basra, under date December 3Dthat Ismail Bey, youngest surviving son of the famous IbrahimPasha, the Milli chief killed by the Young Turks in  1908, hascome in and offered his services to us.  He had been in prison atDamascus, with his brother, Halil, and, having made his escape,got to Jauf, where he was harboured by the Shaalans, and thenceto Dhari  el-Tawalah,  chief  of the  Aslam Shammar,  and  soto Basra.     He counts less with the MiUi Federation (for it is not anyone single tribe) than either his brother or his  uncle, Mali mud-or indeed  his mother, Hansa  Hanum ; but  he is  an importantman, inspired  like  ail the family, with the desire to avenge hisfather.  In the latter&apos;s  time the  Milli  Federation  dominatedNorth Mesopotamia from  Seruj  and  Jerablus, right  across  to
Jezirab-ibn-Omar, where Ibrahim  controlled the passage of the tigris,.and exacted dues from  the migrating tribes.  Even inN.E.  Syria,  west of. the  Euphrates,  he had: great  influence,and  was at  Salahieh, the suburb  of, Damascus  where  several important Kurdish  families have  houses, at the  moment ofthe Young  Turk revolution.  . He -tried  to  get home,  swamthe Euphrates at  Qalat  en-Nejm, but  was  headed off  intothe desert by the Young Turk patrols.   He cultivated relationswith  the  British,  chiefly  through our  Diarbekr Consulate,but also by  entertaining  splendidly any  British traveller  who could be  induced to pass by Vriranshehr, his home near Harran.From time to time he reconciled himself to the Turks, and raisedconstituents for  the Hamidieh Horse  under  his   sons.   Buthe  never  forgot his  father&apos;s  long imprisonment  by   SultanAbdul  Aziz,  or  his own at Sivas.  IsmaiFs  brother,   AbdulHamid, died  in  a  Turkish prison, and his elder brother,  stillpresumably  in  durance  at Damascus,  sympathizes  with the family blood-feud, though in the  Balkan War he distinguishedhimself at the  head of  his  tribal cavalry,  and restored thewaning prestige of his House, and of the Milli.     Since the sphere of the latter includes  the whole  trans-Euphratean   section  of the Baghdad  railway  so  far  as yetconstructed, and  a sub-chief, Basrawi, of the Kitkan section ofthe Berazia  Kurds, ranges close  to the great Jerablus  railway bridge, any member of  Ibrahim&apos;s family is well worth cultivatingat the  present juncture.  The Milli are a fierce fighting /lot,.and passably  well armed, even without our assistance.Saud es-Subhan.    The news that Saud ibn Salih of the Subhan house,  vizier,brother-in-law  and  first cousin of Ibn Rashid, who has  been making overtures to us  for  some  time, has come down  to thechief  of the Aslam Shammar, who is in revolt against the Emirof Hail, is important. He is a bloodstained man,  but perhaps no worse  than  most of his, or  of  the closely allied Rashid, house.It was he who  in  1914  contrived, and  induced the Emir toconnive at, the  murder of Zamil ibn Salim es-Subhan, the vizierwho had saved the Emir as a child, taken him  to  a  refuge atMecca, and finally placed  him  on the throne.   But  such acts ofingratitude and treachery are too many in the sanguinary historyof the  Rashids  and Subhans for special  account  to be taken of any one instance ! .Saud is  not  the  only  member of theseallied  houses out at present for the Emir&apos;s blood and succession.Two Rashid cousins of  the latter, Dhari and Feisal, are with ibn saud,  egging him on  to  action  against Jebel  Shammar,  andhoping to displace the present boorish, treacherous and incapableruler  of Hail, who has allowed the Turks to get a firmer  grip onJebel Shammar than any of his predecessors, and has  long  beenhelping them to  obtain  transport and supplies for  their Hejazforce.
Euphrates Intelligence, December 5-6,  1916.     S.S.O. Nasiriyah, mentions the fact that the Arab tribes  onthe Lower Euphrates have taken great offence  at  the treatmentthe &apos; Turks  have  accorded to the womenfolk of  deserters  in baghdad.   This  is to  some extent substantiated  by  a  letterrecently received by the C.P.O. from the sheikhs of the  Khazailtribe, in  which  the  behaviour  of the  Turks  at Baghdad wasspecifically mentioned.     We could not, however, reckon on much support from theArab tribes  on the Euphrates.    Although at present speciallyanti-Turk, they are probably, as the S.S.O.  Nasiriyah observes,anti any Government, and wish to remain independent.     Ibn  Saud informs  the C.P.O. that-  he believes that 150Turks,  with one or two Germans, constituted the small forcerecently sent to Hail to stiffen Ibn  Rashid.   These seem to havebeen  practically all  gunners.   Ibn   Rashid  had  apparentlyrepresented to the Turks that he could not cope with the Britishand the tribes supplied by them with  war material.     News from Kuweit states that Rashid ibn Lailah, the agent ofIbn Rashid, who was reported to have crossed the desert towardsthe Euphrates with two or three  German and Turkish officers,was  only accompanied  by an escort  of about  thirty  Turkishsoldiers.     The  sheikhs  of  the large  Khazail tribe who live,  roughlyspeaking, in  the  area between Samawa  and Kufah, have sent ina letter  to the C.P.O., stating that they are friendly to  us, andwill  help us if we reach Samawa.  They give details  of somerecent tribal fighting with the Al Fathla, a tribe which lives nearHindiyah, which fighting they say  has been in  our interests, butit is apparently mixed up with questions of land boundaries.     The sheikhs have also written to the Sheikh of Muhammerah,alleging  that they  detest  the  Turks  and stating that  theywill  give the  British  5,000 horsemen  on  arrival  at Samawa,to assist in the capture of  Museyib and Hillah.Aden News.    The  Fadli  Sultan  has been  scolded  by  Ali  Said Pashafor letting his  unruly tribesmen,  the  Marakisha,  loot on  thetrade-routes.   It appears  that trade between  Shukra and Abyanen  route to  Lahej  has been  looted,  and  the  Pasha gives  usan interesting piece of information when he complains that goodsconsigned to  him from Ahwar (Lower Aulaki) have  been  inter-interfered with.  This  proves that some of our  friendlies, who takegoods from Aden, have been unable to  resist the  temptation  tosell in the Lahej market.   The Pasha writes that if the Sultancannot   stop  these depredations  in  his   territories,   he willbe obliged to send his own soldiers to do the necessary; and  hewinds up by  attributing these acts  to &quot;certain  personages&quot;  inShukra  (he alludes to the Fadli&apos;s grandson) who are &quot;incited  bythe intrigues  of the English.&quot;
     The grandson, Abdul Kadir, believes the Sultan will have togo to Lahej to explain  his  attitude.   He  further  reports that several petty Sultans, relatives  of the  Lower  Aulaki Sultan ofAhwar have gone to Lahej.   We know that the Sultan of LowerAulaki, Bubakr bin Nasir, has made a trip to Makalla presumablyto confer personally with the Sultan there as to the correct course to adopt towards his treacherous relations.     Sheikh Akil bin Said, the  friendly Fulesi Sheikh  (Fadli),reports that  the Turks  lost heavily  in the last fight with our troops from Sheikh Othman.  He adds  that the Fadli Sultan will shortly proceed to  Lahej.  Letters received from the old Sultanprove that he must be nearly blind.Movement in Yemen.     In a letter written by Idrisi to the Political Resident, Aden,under date December. 17, it is stated that a  leading Hashidi chiefreplied to  a question put  by the Sherifs representative, theMutawif, Seyyid Yahya Abdurrahman el-Filali, that it was untruethat the Imam&apos;s son had taken Khamir, Tawilah, and Raudhah.He  has returned  now  to his father  at   Sudah (which is  thepresent Imam&apos;s favourite residence) and is  reconciled.Yemen Personalities.     A Turkish officer,  questioned at Aden, has given us thefollowing items of  personal information :      The  Imam is a time-server.   He never goes to Sanaa, andhardly ever to Shehara, but stays at Sudah where he keeps tribalhostages.   He is short, thick  set, and fair.   He does not standwell  with  the Hashid  wa  Bekil,  but has married  Nasir  ibnMabkhut&apos;s sister, and holds him thereby.   The latter &quot;eats with both hands.&quot;     Ali  Said Pasha is a Circassian, a clever  man,  and a goodsoldier, but a  child in  diplomacy.   He relies  blindly on SheikhMohammed Nasir  Muqbil, who is his very  eyes and ears, thoughthoroughly untrustworthy.     Mahmud Nazim Pasha, is a  country-bred  man who  has risen&apos; from small  employ in the  Customs :  but his friendship with the  Imam is invaluable.   The Imam got him his appoint-ment as vali in 1913, against the official candidate, Rejeb  Bey.     Mohammed Nasir  Muqbil is  with the Turks only because we have not fulfilled our part of the agreement with him.  KaidSalih of Qatabah, and  Ahmed Naaman  of Hajariyah are bothunder his  thumb.     The sheikhs of Udein have been  fleeced by the Turks, andare exceedingly exasperated.Abyssinia.     Recent  reports  form  Abyssinia  seem  to  show  that themilitary position of the new Government is wholly satisfactory.After long delays,  the occupation of Wollo and other provinces
lately belonging to the Negus Mikhail is proceeding normally,and  the possibility  of further fighting  may  be regarded  asexcluded.   Early in  December, Ras Waldo Giorgis, about whose attitude the Shoan Government was  for  a  long time doubtful,after vanquishing and capturing MikhaiFs Commander-iri-Chief,Ras  Imer, established  himself  at  Dessie,  the  Negus&apos;s former    Towards the end of December, Lij Yasu, with  a followingof only about twenty men, was reported at Tanta, near Magdala,but was driven away by Ras Demissie at the head of the Shoantroops, and is still a fugitive.   All  organized  opposition is,therefore, now entirely dissipated.    The political position is, however, still  very unsettled, andintrigues of all kinds in support of claims for provinces,  honoursand other forms  of recognition,  many of  which must remainTaitou, widow of Menelik, seems anxious to reassert herself, andto use her great influence over the present Empress Zauditu,  infavour  of certain  family claims which  are  cmite inadmissible.An unfortunate element in the situation is  that Ras  Taffari,although a very excellent and well-meaning young man,  seemsquite incapable of giving final  decisions, and of enforcing hiswill upon Chiefs and Officers, and as there is no other rulingspirit in the Administration to  give it  reasonable  cohesion, theresult is that the policy of the Government wavers from day  today, and a general feeling of instability is produced.     The  King  of  the  Hejaz,  with a  view to  counteractingTurkish propaganda in  Abyssinia, has sent Seyyid Abbas  Melikto represent him at Adis Abeba.Turkish &quot; Literary Deputation&quot;     The literary deputation from Constantinople, (v. pp. 537-8,Arab Bulletin,  No.  35),  has  visited Beersheba, Gaza, Hebron,Bethlehem, Jerusalem,  Deraa, Medina, Damascus and Beyrout.

                         ARABIA.                           Hejaz.                      Summary of News. Turkish Situation.     Two prisoners of the 2nd Battalion 129th Regiment reached Rabugh on January 4.   They gave very full information regard- ing the Turkish dispositions and conditions at the time they left their battalion on December 21.   They formed part of a small detachment sent  to round  up  sheep, and were  surprised  and taken  by the  tribesmen.  When they left,  the  130th  Regiment had lost its  3rd  Battalion and their battalion, the 2nd of the 129th Regiment, had taken  its place.  The three battalions were distributed  at Bir  Jezal,  Bir  Raha and Bir  Wetter.   Each battalion had  only three companies of 200 men each,  and each company had  two machine-guns.   The  hospital rate  was high, at least twenty men per  company reporting sick each day.  Food was good and  adequate, but  all supplies were drawn by mule and camel  transport from  Bir Derwish.  On  going into action each man carried 310 rounds of ammunition ;  and when moving, each battalion had sixty baggage camels.   There were three aeroplanes at Bir Wetter, and our informants saw and counted eight more at Medina some weeks previously.   However, flights were rare, and never  pushed beyond  the  Turkish  lines.   [Probably  from shortage of petrol.]  The 55th  Regiment  (three battalions) was at  Kheif  (Jedeida)  and  Hamra,  when  the   informants  left, the  only elements  south of  the  latter   place  being  Camel Corps   and   Mule  Mounted   Infantry.    The  Turks   were exceedingly distrustful of the Arabs serving with them, and had hoped  to  replace  them  with  men of   Turkish  race.   The surrounding  tribesmen   were   fairly quiet  but  a  continual source  of uneasiness.   The Sheikh of  the   Subh   was  the principal paid  agent of the Turks for giving information regard- ing  Rabugh.   His information, in  the  form  it  reached  the prisoners,  was  not  very  encouraging  to  them  and  rather flattering to  the  SheriPs  forces.   Doubtless   the  longer  the Sheikh can  keep the Turks  where they are, the more money he. can squeeze out of them  for himself.    The  two  chief  features of the  Turkish situation recently have been a further increase  in the sickness rate, and the effective harrassing of  their  communications between   Bir  Abbas  and Medina by Arab tribesmen,  acting  independently.   This  latter activity is most encouraging,  as there are indications that  new tribal elements are coming in.   Whatever may be the temporary defections from the armies of the Sherifial family, it is  clear that the Turks are  in hostile territory, whose  inhabitants are a  per-jjetual source of  danger to their supplies and  communications. On  January  12,  information  reached  Yambo,  that  sometribesmen, described as  part of the Fahad, raided the  Turksat Ibyar el-Alawa about twenty miles from Medina,  capturing
an  officer, one  Rank  Ali  Bey,  nine  men, eleven  rifles,  and six tents.   [Here  we  have again those Al  Fahdah, reported by  Ibn Saud (see  our No.  28,  p.  402).  They are  probably not  the  Firidah,  but a  clan  of  the  Harb  (Beni  Arnr ? )hitherto not  reported  to  us.]  On  January  13,  we receiveda telegram from Jiddah, that a party  of Turks  had been cut upby Radada (a clan of the Beni Salim Harb) and Rahala tribesmenat Hezret Kaft el-Bureish (Fureish ?).   [Later this affair has been located  more exactly at Hezra,  in  the  Manjur  pass,  aboutfifteen miles  S.W\ of Medina, on the  Bir Derwish  road.]   Anumber were killed, and fifteen unwounded prisoners including one  officer  and  a wireless  specialist  were  captured.   Alsosixty-three  Turkish  rifles  were  being  brought in.   Anotherreport states that the Hawazim have surprised and killed  twelveTurks at  Safra  (?Wadi  Safra).  These  reports   refute  theunconfirmed news, given  in our last  issue,  that the Beni Saiim,as a whole, had defected.      .       .....     .  ..&apos; 7..  .   .,     There is no news of any important change in the Turkishdispositions.   This  fact, coupled with  the  news of the raids by independent   tribesmen,  goes  to  emphasize  the  difficulties experienced by  the Turks  in advancing their now  somewhatGermanized army through extremely difficult and hostile country,with a distant railhead and no made roads.  The administrativedevelopments  of  modern scientific war  seem  to  have cloggedtheir mobility and destroyed  their dash.   Their difficulties seemto increase in geometrical rather  than  arithmetical  progressionthe further they move from Medina.FeisdVs Movements.     Sidi Feisal is reported to be leaving Um  Lejh on January .15,on his-expedition against Wejh, with the  further objective of^either joining up  with Sidi Abdullah at Wadi Ais or advancing toEl-Ala.   He has left Sherif Sharraf in command of Yambo and district with 800 reliable men and  such  Beni Salim  Harb  as arestill in the field.  There are also  a number  of  Juheinah,  up  to2,000 men, acting independently in Wadi  Yambo.   Feisal&apos;s  ownforce is  estimated at 3,000 men, nearly all  mounted,  with about600 baggage camels, twelve machine-guns (mule and camel), underthe command  of Abdullah Bey, two  fifteen-pounder guns,  andtwo 2-95 guns formerly belonging to the Egyptian Artillery.  Hehas a small unit of  mule cavalry under  Muluk Ibn Makhlus,  anative of Mosul.   Barakat ibn  Smeiyah ^Smeir ? of the WuldAli sheikhly  house?] acts  as  a  sort of  A.A.G. for  him,  andYusuf el-Khusian,   a Medina townsman of Juheinah  origin,acts  as  paymaster.    He hopes to bring in a  number of  Billiand other tribesmen as he advances,  and  thus  to  increase hisforce.  His  personal prestige seems as great  as ever.    On January 10, we  received a telegram from  Yambo  thatcommunication had been established between Sidi Abdullah  andSidi Feisal.   As a result a  demolition party was  being sent upto Sidi Abdullah, whose forces have been making for the Hejazrailway  near Abul Nairn.
     Sidi  Feisal&apos;s  object  ill attacking El-Ala  is  to open  upcommunication with, and a means  of  supply for Nuri  Shaalan,and other northern chiefs, who have offered to co-operate.  we now have a report of an important meeting which took  place atJauf  early  in December.  Those present  are  given  as  Nurihimself, his son Nawvvaf, Fawaz el-Faiz of the Beni Sakhr, andSinaitan.  The last-named is new to us.  It was resolved at thismeeting  to  break off  at  once  all relations  with  the  TurkishGovernment, but active co-operation was pronounced impossibleuntil Sidi Feisal should have reached El-Ala, and thereby openedup a means for getting munitions  and supplies to the Ruwalla,and other tribes.  The messenger, who brought the account of thismeeting  to Yambo, stated that  Nawwaf hoped to conquer Hail,and haying eliminated  the Ibn Rashid  dynasty, to become  Emirhimself of a Ruwalla  and Shammar confederation.   This opensup possible difficulties with Ibn  Saud,  who undoubtedly regardsthe elimination of Ibn  Rashid as his particular job.   There is areport that at the present  moment  lbn Saud,  on his return toRiyadh  from  Basra,  is  collecting his forces, with  a  view to establishing them in the Qasim countiw in order to  threaten IbnRashid from the south and  east.  The latter  is reported  to be with a Turkish detachment  between Hail and  Qasim.     The co-operation  of Beni Sakhr  and  Ruwalla  chiefs is significant.   Tewfik el-Mujali of Kerak is also reported to have written,   through  Sidi Feisal,  to the King of the Hejaz  infavourable terms,  holding out  hopes  of  eventual  co-operation.Much, therefore,  will depend upon  the fortune  of  Sidi Feisal&apos;operations.Sidi Ali.     There is no news of  importance from Rabugh.  The most recent aeroplane reconnaissance  still reports  the main  body  ofSidi Ali&apos;s force to be at Um Beirak, though he himself had been to Abu Dhibaa.   The reinforcements  sent from Rabugh werereplaced, on January 7, hy 200 reinforcements from  Mecca, beingthe first  instalment of  1,000 fresh  men to be  despatched fromthe latter place to Rabugh.   There is a certain amount of friction and intrigue among  the Syrian  and other  Arab officers  atRabugh, which is in consonance with the recent  traditions  ofthis somewhat ill-starred place.     Fuad el-Khatib, and  Ahmed Fauzi el-Bakri are  on their way from Mecca to Egypt on  a short visit.  Some interesting letters to the King of the Hejaz, from  Adis Abeba, show that his causeis gaining ground among the  Moslems of south-west Abyssinia.The local Ulema are reported to have  arranged to  mention his name in  the Friday Prayers.     There  is much  that is symptomatic in the  situation atpresent.   Three fresh  Harb clans  (it was the  Sawad clan of theAuf who effected the  Manjur raid)  have entered the field,  andthey operate close to Medina.   The Turks are said to have called
in  their outposts from Jebel Ohod, and to have sent  sixtyMedina  notables to  freeze at Kirk Kilisse.   If it is  true, asMecca reports, that twenty-two  German officers  have arrived atMedina, some serious necessity  has forced on  Fakhri  Pasha ameasure which will  stiffen  the  tribes against  him, neutralizehis propaganda, and alienate the city.   Something is evidentlyrotten in the Turkish position at Medina.     Since the above was written, an indication (from an authenticsource) has come to hand that the  Turks  are reorganizing thedefence of   their lines  of  communication between  Hamra andMedina by  the retirement of two  battalions of the 55th Regimentback along  the line from Kheif.   Two companies of  the 2/129thare retiring toward  Bir  Derwish,  leaving the remaining company at Bir Raha.   Two companies of the  2/55th are taking up theduties of the two retired companies  of the 2/129th in the BirRaha Ghayir link.   The Field Hospital  is being withdrawn tothe position it was in before the recent advance to Wadi  Safra.     We hear  also  of the imminent  arrival  at  Mecca of a newauxiliary force of  North Asir  tribesmen, under Sheikh  AbdulAziz  ibn Hamid.   Among  his followers are  Beni - Saad  andBishawis, and, probably, Zahran and  Ghamid elements.  These arestouter military material than the Hejaz tribes can supply.                          SYRIA.                Jewish  Colonies  in Palestine.          .......    In  addition to the large Jewish settlements  in Jerusalem,Jaffa, Haifa, Tiberias  and  safe, there now exist  in  Palestineover  forty Jewish Agricultural Colonies in  Western  Judea,Samaria, and Eastern  Galilee.  The oldest of  these colonies isthat of  Mikveh  Israel,  founded  by  the &quot; Alliance  IsraeliteUniverselle&quot; of Paris in  1870,  as  an Agricultural School forJewish   children  in  Near Eastern  countries.    The  ottoman government granted the Paris Society 625 acres of land nearJaffa for the purpose, and this small colony, or rather school, hascontinued on its original lines to this day.    The next step in Jewish colonization was taken in  1878, bya group of British  Jews  which  resulted  in the foundation ofPetach  Tikveh,  now one of  the largest and most  prosperous of allthe Jewish Colonies.  It started  with  about 700 acres of landabout nine miles  from  Jaffa, and  now comprises  5,700 acres,largely under oranges.   In 1913, this colony produced 675 boxesof oranges to the acre, probably the highest yield  of  any orangecultivation  in  the  country.  This colony is  reputed to  be themost orthodox of all the Jewish Colonies in religion, and  althoughcomposed of Jews  from all parts of the world,  retains  a british connection.  The  two principal  landowners  in the colony  atpresent  are Golomb, a  Jew from Bessarabia,  and Apfelbaum,also from Russia.                 .        .       -  -
                 The persecutions which broke out in Roumania and Russia,0           in 1882, gave the next  impetus to colonization,  and between             that  year and 1884,  the following colonies were  started  by             refugees :                   Near Jaffa : Richon-le-Zion, now 3,180 acres.                               Wadi el-Shanin, now 760 acres.                               Ekron, now 3,570 acres.                               Katrah, now 1,360 acres.                 In the Northern part of the Plain of Sharon :                                Zichron Jacob, now 5,900 acres.               ..  In  Galilee: -Rosh  Pinah,  now 9,500 acres,  (the  largest                                   colony).                               Yessod Hamaaleh, now 2,900 acres.                               Mishmar Hayarden, now 1,750 acres.                 These  eight  colonies began  in a small way, and have  all             grown  considerably  since.  Zichron Jacob  is almost entirely             occupied  by Jews of Roumanian origin.  The  President of this             settlement is  named Niederman,  and  other prominent  persons             connected with  the colony are  Lupo Neumann,  one  of  the             directors  of  the Gymnasium at Jaffa, the  principal centre  of             Jewish higher education in Palestine, and Raphael Cohen,  who is             the local  representative of Baron Edmand de Rothschild.                 In 1891, the  large  colony  of  Chederah, about ten  miles             south  of  Zichron  Jacob,  was  started.  This  colony, which is             flourishing, now  comprises  7,125 acres, and  is largely run  by             a family of four brothers named Samsonov, who  are  among the             most respected and influential of all  the Jewish Colonists, and             are reported to be pro-British in sentiment.                 At  first  these  colonies  were  peopled  largely  by  refugee             town-bred  Jews,  who  knew  nothing  of the  Arabs,   or  of             agriculture, and serious  difficulties were  encountered.    They             weathered the storm, however, largely owing to  the efforts and             munificence of  Baron Edmand de  Rothschild and  his friends             and family.                 The   next important event  in  the  history  of  Jewish             colonization  in Palestine, was  the  publication  in   1896  of  a             remarkable pamphlet in German, English, and French, entitled             the &quot; Jewish State,&quot; by a Viennese Jew named Herzl.  This was             the beginning of modern  Zionism.   Henceforth  Jewish  colon-             ization lost its purely philanthropic character, and acquired a             definite  political  object,  viz.  the gradual  establishment of a             Jewish State  in  Palestine, either  sovereign and independent  or             autonomous under the protection of one or more European Powers.             Herzl was  a  man  of  great activity and  magnetic personality.             He travelled about Europe and America preaching his doctrine,             presided at a series of Zionist congresses at Basle  and elsewhere,
and  even  negotiated  personally with  Sultan  Abdul Hamid in1902 for the acquisition of extensive areas of land.  These latternegotiations came to nothing, but the advertisement of the newideal gave  great encouragement to the  further  establishmentof independent colonies.    Realizing the difficulties in  the wayof the early achievement of his ideals in Palestine, Herzl startedan  alternative scheme for  establishing   outside  Palestine  anindependent Jewish Colony.   He entered  into  negotiations withthe  British  Government for the acquisition of suitable  territory,first  in Sinai, and then in British  East  Africa ;  but in spite ofconsiderable  encouragement from  our Government these plansproved abortive.   Herzl died in 1904.  After  him, the idea ofestablishing  a Zionist colony  under  the protection  of  GreatBritain,  has  been continued  by  Mr. Wolff,  and  Mr.  IsraelZangwill.  Cj^renaica was investigated,  but the  hostility  of thelocal Arabs, and  the  alleged  shortage  of. water,  prevented  this region being taken up.     The  Turkish revolution of  1908, was  favourable  to theextension of Palestinian colonization, and  from this time forward the  Zionist  movement  gained  predominant   influence in  theold and  the new colonies.   The Zionists brought several new factors to bear.  ,  They  established  at  Jaffa and  Jerusalem theAnglo-Palestine Bank  for financing the colonies, and at Jaffa  anImmigration Bureau, called the Palestine Bureau  in  touch  withthe Zionist organizations in America and   elsewhere.   The  mostactive people in these institutions are David Levantine, of Jaffa,the  Director-General of  the  Bank, Isaac Levi,  the  Jerusalemmanager,  and Dr.  Hoffien,  a Dutch  Jew, the Jaffa  manager.These men are all keen  Zionists, and  act in  concert  with thehead of the Palestine Bureau, Dr. Rupin.   The present leader ofthe Zionists outside Palestine is Judge  Brancleis,  in  the UnitedStates of America.  America  has become the principal source ofZionist support.   Two of the most recent American Ambassadorsto the Porte have been Jews,  and the second,  Mr. Morgenthau,may  be regarded as an  active Zionist.   The Central ZionistCommittee now meets  in New York, and   in 1916 no  less  than 3,000,000 were collected  in  America  by  Zionist organizations.     The Zionist policy in  the colonies has been an exclusive one,that is  to  say,  the Zionists have secured  the complete  dis-possession of the Arabs,  and established purely  Jewish colonies.They have even  obtained Jews from  the Yemen  to performsome of the agricultural work.  They have fostered  the Hebrewlanguage,  and established it as the common language of  cbm-munication  between the  polyglot  immigrants.   Not  only  isHebrew  taught  in  the schools,  but  instruction is  given inHebrew.   A Union of Hebrew teachers, Merkas Ha Morim, hasbeen started to standardize new  Hebrew words  and expressions,and  thus to modernize the  language where necessary.   The headof this  Union is Dr.  Bougratchoff.   It publishes a journal,Ha  Chinoch, which is  subventioned by the Jewish Committee in
Odessa.  This latter is also an  active assistant in colonization,and has been the means of  sending a large number  of  youngRussian Jews to settle in  Palestine.     The  Zionist movement is not altogether welcomed by themore  old fashioned  and  more  orthodox Sepharditn Jews andRabbis  of  Jerusalem,  to  whom  religious  orthodoxy  is  of paramount importance.    The  Zionists comprise a large numberof non-orthodox Jews, who are just as keen (if not keener), onthe new  national and racial ideal as the orthodox section,  whoare called  the &quot;Mizraehi.&quot;   The present object of the Zionistsis to  acquire  as  much  land  in  Palestine   as possible,  tocolonize this land, and so  to reach the ultimate political objective.A good deal of local hostility has been aroused, especially  amongMoslem landowners, by the purchase of land by Jews.  In 1911,a  debate  was arranged in the  Turkish Parliament by the Arabmembers and the Old Turks, but the subject was closured by theGovernment.  The  Young  Turk  committee  is considerablyinfluenced  by Jewish financial control, and one  at any rate, ofthe most  prominent  Young  Turks,  Javid  Bey, is himself aCrypto-Jew (i.e. Dunmeh,) and of Jewish sympathies.    Twelve new colonies have been started  since the revolutionof 1908, and at the  outbreak of the war, the area bought  by theJews  for  settlement  was  130,000 acres,  of which 90,000 acreshad been  actually colonized.  These acres comprise much of thevery  best  land  in  Palestine.  Great  efforts are being made toteach  those Jews,  who  come  from towns, modern  agriculturalmethods.   An up-to-date  agricultural  experimental  station  hasbeen  successfully established  at Athlit on the southern side ofMount Carmel.  Agricultural progress in  the colonies is notable.This  is partly  due to  the advantage which the Jewish colonisthas over the unfortunate  Moslem peasant, in being able to resistmore effectively the unjust and extortionate  demands of the Turkishtax collector.   The  Turkish law forbidding Jews  to  settle  oracquire  land  in  Palestine is of course a dead letter, and seemsto be retained  merely  as  a means whereby the ministers  atConstantinople  can  extort &quot;bakshish&quot; in return for suspending the law in  each case as it comes up.    The Germans have attempted to exert their influence  amongthe Jews of Palestine.  About twelve years ago they started the&quot; Hilfsverein der Deutschen Juden&quot;  to  take  up the  cause  of jewish education in Palestine, Avhich  had hitherto been  almostentirely indebted to English and French Jewish philanthropy.The Hilfsverein  undertook an  expenditure of about   10,000 ayear mainly on the establishment  of  Kindergartens  at  the  fivetowns, Jerusalem, Jaffa,  Haifa, safe and Tiberias.  An attempt was made later to introduce the teaching of German  into theJewish schools, but this ended in 1913 in violent opposition andeven riot.   Hebrew is now paramount in all these schools; Englishprobably  comes  next,  and French  next in those  schools  of&quot;Alliance&quot; origin.   The Jaffa gymnasium, which is largely run
by young Russian Jews, is the most complete college of secondaryand higher Jewish education in Palestine.  Latin, French, English,German, and even  Arabic, are taught, as well  as Physics andChemistry.:  these last in Hebrew.  No religious instruction,  assuch, is given, though the Bible and Talmud  are,  of course,included in the curriculum.  The number of pupils has increased in a remarkable manner : 100 in 1907 ; 260 in 1911 ; 514 in 1913 ;and 700 in  1914.    This institution is. very successful, but is not.altogether smiled upon by the  orthodox Rabbis.     Mention should also  be&apos; made  of the Bezalel,  founded  in1905 by Professor Boris Schatz.   It is a workshop as well  as a school,  and  it aims at the creation of a distinctively Jewish styleof art and industrial craft.   Carpet  weaving, metal-work, litho-graphy, lace-work and carpentry are all taught and applied.  In1913, Bezalel products realized  10,000 gross, of which  6,000was paid out in wages.  The commercial side of  the  Bezalel hasrecently been extended and reorganized.     Generally speaking, the political  proclivities of the Jews ofPalestine  may be described as anti-Russian above  all things.They appear to have maintained a strictly neutral attitude duringthis war,  though those of  British  origin   have  been compelledto  abandon  the  country.   Of all  European  powers  it wouldappear  that  England is  regarded  as the most -friendly, and themost  likely  to  facilitate  the realization  of the Zionist ideals.The early emancipation of the Jews  in England and the1 positionattained there by   Sir  Moses  Mpntefiore, whose  name  is  a.household word among Eastern Jews,  by the Rothschilds and byLord Beaconsfield,  contrasts  favourably   with  the treatmentof Jews in  Germany and  elsewhere.  On the other hand,  Mr.Hyamsori reports in the &quot; Quarterly Review&quot; for October, 1916,that Germany has  been spreading  amongst Zionists  in neutral countries  and especially  in America, propaganda to the effectthat the success of German arms  will mean a gift of Palestineby  Turkey  to the Jews.    In  spite of Jemal Pasha&apos;s  personalhostility to Zionism, the Turks  have evidently  been afraid tomete out to  them the same measure of persecution that has fallen to the lot of Moslem and Christian inhabitants of Palestine  and syria during the war.  To judge from reports and  articles in theEnglish and American press, it would appear that the  Zionistmovement in Palestine and outside  has gained rather than  lostsince  the beginning  of the war, and  that a determined effort willbe made to  further its ideal at the eaidiest possible  moment.   In1916,  Zionist congresses  have been  held in various  parts ofAmerica,  and  Zionist  propaganda  is  actively,  pushed  in  theUnited  States.     It  must be made  clear that no  Zionist  contemplates  thereturn of any large proportion  of  his race  to the little  land ofPalestine.   What he seeks is a  nucleus of  Jews living , in  andpossessing the Promised Land, the spiritual focus and witness ofthe Jewish  nation.   Many Zionists  no  doubt  hope to  see  a
Jewish temple rise once more on the threshing-floor of  Ornanthe Jebu8ite, and the walls of Zion surround  a city consecratedto the worship of Jehovah.  On the other hand, many of themregard the colonization of Palestine as the establishment of anasylum where their, as yet, unemancipated brethren from Russiacan. find a more tolerable home.  Autonomy is  still regarded bythe majoritj&apos; as a distant goal, to be ultimately  attained throughthe benevolence of a friendly protecting power.  Meanwhile, thepersistent pressure of a patient  race is gradually reacquiring forthe Jews the soil of their ancient home.

NOTES.Kuweit  News.     The  Emir  of Riyadh and the  Sheikh of  Muhammeraharrived  at Kuweit with Sultan Jabir on November 29, after theirBasra visit.   They had been much impressed and gratified  by all they had seen.   Ibn Saud  pleaded  for  the  removal of  therestrictions on kerosene,  which, he said,  was much  needed inNejd.   He asserted that, since he had stopped all caravan trafficwith enemy towns and tribes, there is  no danger in  permittingthis  importation.   He asked  also  for an improvement in  thesteamer service between Bahrein and  Kuweit.   After  (among other things) accompanying Sultan Jabir to tea at the  AmericanMission House, Ibn Saud left by sea for Qatif on December 2.     It should be noted, however, that  according to our inform-ation, supplies  have  been passing from  Kuweit  to  Hail, and thence to Medina, not long ago.  It is up to Ibn  Saud to controlthese caravans en route for flail, in the Meteir country, even if
they do not actually pass through his province of Qasim.   Gil isvery important to the  Turks  at  Medina at  present, &apos; especiallybenzine,  for lack  of which, their aeroplanes have  long beencomparatively inactive.The Meteir (Umteir)  Tribe.     It appears that the well-known chief of the Alwi section  ofthe Meteir,  Feisal ibn Maji ed-Derwish, is dead.  He is reportedto have gone mad in Hasa, and to have  come  by  his end afterrunning amok.   He was  a man of great energy, despite hiscorpulence,  and generally kept in good relations with our KuweitAgency.  The son, Abdul Aziz, who has succeeded and is spoken of as Paramount  Chief of  all  the  Meteir,  is a boy  of  aboutfifteen, of fair complexion, and shy.  He came into Kuweit onDecember 5 with a  caravan  from  Hasa.   There has  been somequestion, supposed to have been raised by Salim, the  brother  ofthe Sultan of  Kuweit, about the activity of  the American  Bible-colporteurs among the Meteir, who are in Ibn  Saud&apos;s  federation.Ibn Saud&apos;s visit to the Mission at  Kuweit (see above)  does not look as if he personally were offended.   It  may be rememberedthat he recently  solicited the medical help of one of  the Bahreinmissionaries, and, doubtless he feels he may  want it again.Damascus Court Martial.          (El share, December 11, 1916.)    &quot; The Court Martial at Damascus, according  to the  courtproceedings  under date November 30, 1916. charged        Abdel Sattar el-Senderusi,......      Hakki el-Azm,      Refik el-Azm,       Sheikh Reshid Rida and his brother Sheikh Saleh,      Dr. Abdel Rahman Shahbandar,      Abdel Fattah el-Yafi,      Hassan Daher,       .      Hassan el-Bassrawi,      Abdalla el-Mosalli,      Sherif  Ahmed,      Sherif Feisal,      Nessib el-Bakri,      Fauzi el-Bakri,with  the crime of organizing a revolutionary society.  A de\&amp;of ten days is granted to them, to report themselves at the saidcourt for trial.   If they fail  to obey  this  order they will  beconsidered deprived of all the rights of  citizenship, will be triedin default and all their properties confiscated.&quot;     [Note by Arab  Bureau. Hakki and Refik are of theDamascus branch of the  great and once powerful Azm family ;they are cousins, and both now in Cairo  ; they are not out-arid-out rebels ;  the first desires a French Protectorate in Syria, theother automony under Turkish suzerainty.  Sheikh (Mohammed)
Rashid Rida  of Kalamun near  Tripoli,  now  in Cairo, is thewell-known pan-Arab chauvinistic agitator and preacher whose activities  extend  from Cairo  to  India.   He  preached at themosque at Mina during the last hay before  the Sherif,  but  waschecked when his remarks  became fanatical. &apos;     Dr.   Abdurrahman Shahbander  of  Damascus has  been in medical charge of the Meadi prisoners of war, and is now on thestaff of the Kawkab at Cairo. -    ;  &apos;     Sherif Ahmed may be Ahmed el-Mansur, Emir of the Harb,now helping the King of the  Hejaz.     Sherif Feisal is the latter&apos;s third son, and will not be easilycaught.  For (Ahmed)  Fauzi el-Bakri, see our No. 37, p. 8.]The Zaraniq  Tribe.     The  Zaraniq  maintain, apparently, their contumacy in the yemen Tihamah.   They ar,e  reported  to   have held  up  inDecember  last,  at  Mansuriyah (about thirty  miles E.S.E.  ofHodeidah), a Turkish force of two hundred men with two guns,on its  way to Beit el-Faqih and Zebid, probably to collect taxes.At  the end of  four days, having  used  up  their ammunition,the tribesmen retired.Abyssinia.     Further reports about the intrigues proceeding in Abyssiniahave reached us.   Among other  appointments,  Ras Guksa,  son of Ras Wolye, and husband of the Empress Zauditu, has  receivedthe  province of  Sayint.   Seeing  that Ras   Wolye  has  alreadybeen given the provinces of Edgu and last, this appointment is interesting as  it  points  to  a recrudescence  of  the influence of  Queen Taitou,  who was deposed  in 1910 for intriguingto place  all her  relatives in positions  of  importance.  since then, she  has been practically a prisoner at large arid it was  only within the last year that she was allowed to take up her residenceat Entotto.  The nomination of Zauditu,  over whom she alwayshad considerable hold, to the throne has given her another chanceof  exerting  her influence and  she has tried to insist  thather  nephew, Ras  Guksa,  should be allowed  to take  up  hisresidence in the Ghebi as  husband of the Empress.  The fehoanparty strongly objected, and  Ras Guksa&apos;s present nomination isprobably a compromise which aims at  pacifying  Queen Taitouand  getting  rid of Guksa from Adis  Abeba.   Ras TafEari is,however,  aware  of the  danger  of  allowing  her  to  exercise any  real  influence again   audit  is  not  thought  that Taitou&apos;efforts  will meet  with  any  success.   Ras Taffari,  however,is overwhelmed with claims ; for  at  present all the ministers areintriguing for increase of  power, and all the officers  who  took part in  the revolution, great and   small,   are clamouring  forprovinces or titles.
4r- 38 -&quot;&apos;&apos;  &apos; &quot;Business seems at a standstill, for the ministers, not knowing which of them will  remain in power, stand  aside, unwilling to accept any responsibility.      A reorganization of the Government  is badly  needed,  but can scarcely take place before the army is  disbanded,  and, with its chiefs,  has returned to the provinces.   But as  long as Lfj Yasu is  at large and  the different districts of Wollo  are  not taken over by their new chiefs, this cannot be done.      So far as can be  seen,  there is every  prospect  of several months&apos;  more  confusion   before the   country  returns  to  a normal  state.
