SECRET.18APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT, No. XIIL                                      RUSSIA.     THE agreement with Russia regarding alternative enlistment of Russian subjectsdomiciled in this  country raises several  points of difficulty.  The  project will hardly be very welcome  to the  Russian Government  unless a serious attempt be made tofacilitate the return  of  those and  they are many -who  now  express a  preference to return to  Russia to  enlist there.    The shipping difficulty  will  at once presentitself.   Those remaining  in England, who will consist mainly of Russian  Jews whowould not  mix too easily with ordinary  British battalions, will  undoubtedly  desireto form distinctively Jewish   battalions.   If these  were formed and used  in thePalestine theatre  the morale would probably be good,  but  difficulties of officering andgeneral military administration would be  bound to arise.     The division  of opinion  in  the  Russian Government  regarding the  future ofConstantinople is most significant.  We  have  been too ready  to see in Russia&apos;s formeraspirations  a  desire for an economic outlet.  This desire has in Russia always beensecondary to the religious and  national  sentiment, which centred round the  idea of theCzar seated on the  throne of Constantine and  attending Mass  in  a  reconsecratedSanta Sophia.  Now there is a  Czar no longer,  and the  Church is not likely to maintain its peculiar  position vis-d-vis the Russian State, one is not surprised that the aspirationshave changed.     With regard  to the internal condition of Russia, the telegrams received during thelast  week from various sources all tend  to show a distinct  improvement in the state ofaffairs, and lead one to hope that the worst is over.                                      SYRIA.     Italian participation in our Palestinian campaign has important political significance.Although there is as yet no demand for a share in a political mission, military co-operationinevitably gives the Italians some right  to a locus standi in determining the future ofthe territory to be won.   Hitherto France has been regarded by the Vatican as the soleprotector of Catholic interests in  the  East.   Nevertheless, in ecclesiastical as well assecular  matters the Italians have been  furthering their interests in the East  Medi-terranean with no little persistence.  This cannot But affect the monopoly hithertoclaimed by France.  The future delimitation of those areas has been regarded as chieflyconcerning  the  Arabs, the British, and  the  French.   Now, however, the Italians areasserting themselves, not merely as Allies, but as an interested nation, and if they are interested so are others.    The  growing force of Zionism, the protection of the variousorthodox sects, and the position of the  Druses are all matters which must arise in thisconnection.[898-40J
                                      ARABIA.     There is no news of interest from the Hejaz.  Signs  of  activity on the part ofIdrissi are welcome, but it is still very doubtful whether this Seyid either wishes  or isable to do anything effective against the Turkish garrisons in Asir.Aden.     The successful  episode recorded in this excerpt reminds one that not only the basisof the  Turkish position  in  Yemen, but also of the pro-Turk propaganda in Abyssinia,pivots on  the  Turkish  force before  Lahej, and  that, if opportunity  offered, theremoval of this pivot, which must have suffered severe  attrition  during  the last twoyears, would leave very beneficial results upon the political conditions on either side ofthe Red Sea, and its southern approaches.  The automatic Arab rising in Yemen whichwould probably follow would tend to  counteract any exaggerated Italian pretensions inthat area.                                      INDIA.     The  maintenance  of the Haj  is one of the most vital  elements in our policy,both from the Arabian  and Indian  point of view.   Every effort should be made tosecure reasonable facilities for the journey to Mecca for such Moslem subjects of theKing-Emperor as are willing and able to undertake  it.  The keeping open of the Hajduring  the war will have very lasting effect upon  our  position after the war, and inthis matter the long view is very necessary.     April 26, 1917.

Buchanan [No. 777]  on the 22nd April saying thatthe Russian Government did not appear to understand the situation.  The Home Officeregulations applied only to voluntary enlistment by Russians, and were  devised  on theassumption that any Russians who refused to enlist should be deported to Russia.  Theidea of deportation had long been abandoned, and  was, indeed, impracticable owing totonnage difficulties ;  in any case the scheme  had produced  little or no  result, and theregulations had no bearing on the present situation.  The difficulties which had  arisen,owing to the great number of Russian Jews in East London, had already been explained:complaints were now being received from individuals, a strong agitation was growingin Parliament, and the police were nervous of anti-Russian outbreaks.   It was therefor of the utmost importance that an agreement should be secured  with the RussianGovernment   as soon  as  possible.    The Russian  draft agreement  was unsuitable, itwas  loosely drawn, would not square with the Military  Service Act, and many of its provisions were unnecessary.   Another draft had  therefore been prepared, one whichwould suit us and which seemed  fair, as the Russians would enjoy the  same conditionsas to pay,  allowances, &amp;c, as British subjects.  Sir G.  Buchanan  was instructed  tocommunicate this  draft to the Russian Government, and to do what  he could to  secure its immediate concurrence, pointing out that there were over 20,000 Russians of military age in London alone.     The draft agreement is as follows :      1.  Every male British subject in Russia who  at the date of this  agreement hasattained the age of 18, and has not attained the age of 41,  and who, if he were for the       [898-40]                                                           B
 time being resident in Great Britain, would be liable to military service in the British army, and every male Bussian subject in Great Britain who at the  date  of this agree- ment has attained the age of 18, and has not attained the age  of 41, and  who, if  he were for the time being resident in Russia, would be  liable  to military service in the Bussian army, shall either return to his own country or shall become liable to serve  in the army of the country in which he is for the time being resident.      Provided that no male British subject in Russia between  the  ages of 18  and 41, and  no male Russian subject in Great Britain between the ages of 18 and 41, shall  be regarded  by  the  Russian Government  and  the  British Government respectively  as excepted  from  the operation  of this article  on the ground of non-liability to military service by the law of his own country unless he holds a certificate of such non-liability issued to him by or on behalf of the British Ambassador in Petrograd and the  Russian Ambassador in London respectively.      2. The British Ambassador in Petrograd and the Bussian Ambassador in London shall be respectively entitled in any special case to issue a certificate of exemption to a British subject remaining in Prussia and to a Russian subject remaining  in Great Britain from liability to military service in that country.      3. The  holder either  of  a certificate of non-liability  given  under the  proviso to article 1, or of a special certificate of exemption given under article  2, not  returning to his own country, shall  not be required  to serve in the army of the country in which he remains.     4.  Every male British subject in Russia  between the ages of 18 and 41, who has not left Russia  for Great  Britain within thirty days after the date of this agreement, and who  does not  hold either a certificate of non-liability given under the proviso  to article 1, or a special certificate of exemption given  under article 2,  and every male Russian subject in Great Britain between the ages of I 8 and 41, who has not left Great Britain for Russia within thirty days after the date of this agreement, and who does not hold  either a certificate of  non-liability given under the proviso to article  1, or a special certificate of exemption given under article 2. shall become  liable on the expiration  of this period to serve in the  Russian or British army respectively.     Neither the Russian  Government nor the British Government shall be under any obligation to pay the expenses of the return of a British subject  from Bussia to Great Britain or of a Russian subject from Great Britain to Russia.     Provided that any  British subject in Russia, and any  Russian subject  in Great Britain who, having obtained  a passport,  permit, or  other  similar document  for the purpose  of returning to his own country, does not leave within thirty days  after the date of this agreement shall become liable to serve in the army of the country in which he remains.     5. The Russian Government may take such  steps as are necessary by law to secure that any British subject in R-ussia who,  under the terms  of  this agreement, becomes liable to serve in the Russian  army, shall so  serve; and the British Government may take such steps  as  are necessary by law  to secure that any  Bussian subject in Great- Britain who, under the terms of this agreement, becomes liable to serve in the British army, shall so serve.     Provided that a subject of either contracting  party, liable under the terms of  thisagreement to serve,  or serving, in the  arm)&apos; of the other contracting  party, shall be treated in regard to conditions of service,  pay, allowance, pensions, rights of exemption on medical or other grounds,  medical re-examination,  and  discharge  in  all  respects in the same manner  as a  subject  of the  country in  which he  is  for the time beingresident.     6. This agreement shall also apply to  any  male  British subject in Bussia, and to any male  Russian subject in Great Britain, who,  being  under the age of 1 S at the date of the agreement,  attains  the  age  of 18  during the  continuance of the war, with the modification that in any such  case liability to serve in the  Russian or  British armyrespectively shall not arise till thirty days after the attainment of the age of 18.     7. This agreement may at any time  be extended by the mutual consent of the Russian and British Governments so as  to apply to male Russian and  British subjects over the age of 41, and within such age limits as may be  agreed, residing for the timebeing in the country of the other Government.     Committee of Workmen  and Soldiers&apos; Delegates. Sir C.  Marling  telegraphed onthe 20th April [No. 139]  that a general supervision of Russian  services in Persia  hadbeen assumed  by representatives of the Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Committee,  who  hadsuspended or dismissed the consuls at Resht and Tabriz, and had the legation and the
o182banks under examination.   Telegraphing again  on the 23rd April TNo. 141], he saidthat the effort to supervise officials  made by the committee was assuming a harmlessshape.  After the departure of a delegate from Baku, the colony in Teheran had held ameeting and formed a  permanent  committee  to exercise  general  supervision  overBussian affairs.   Besolutions in favour of continuing the war and of confidence in theProvisional Government were  passed.   Matters seemed to  be settling down, too,  atBesht and Kasvin, and the troops were reverting to ordinary discipline.     The Constantinople  Agreement. Sir G. Buchanan said in a telegram of the 21stApril  [No. 559] that the  Provisional  Government was divided on the subject of Con-stantinople; the Prime Minister and the Mi nister of Foreign  Affairs were ardentadvocates of its incorporation in  Russia, bat the Minister of Justice would like to seeall agreements involving  annexation  of territory  annulled.     Newrailivay communications with  Kherson.  The  consul-general at Odessa in a despatch dated, the  13th  March [No.  25] transmitted a memorandum from  the vice-consul at Kherson regarding new railway communications with that place :       1.  Kherson  to  Merefa.   This  line he  said was practically completed,  but the            Government being in urgent need of rails they were taken off and used for            other purposes  ; the foundation  of the line, however, is in complete order,            and as soon  as  rails are  available they will be laid down.  The new line is            very important for  the export of grain to or from  Kherson,  and it may be            expected that  by the time foreign export becomes possible it will be in full            working  order.     2.  Kherson to  Djanjoi.  This  line, which wil!  join Kherson with the Crimea-            Kertch,  is  in full progress and,  in order not to interfere with the river            traffic, it has&apos;been  decided by the Government  that the bridge across the            Dnieper (which will  be begun this year) shall be  high enough to allow a            continuous river service.     3.  Saratov  to  Alexandrovsk.   The Government  has officially  decided  on  the            building  of a new line between these places ; and from the latter goods can            be  forwarded by the river Dnieper  to Kherson, which  will considerably            increase its exports and imports.                                   FINLAND.    Recruitment of Labour. Sir G.  Buchanan telegraphed on the 19th April [No. 553]that he had been informed  by the Russian Government that it  had no objection to the recruitment of labour in Finland, and  that it had telegraphed  in that sense to theGovernor-General.  Mr. Puddy, he added, who was there on behalf of the War Office,had already visited Finland.                                  ABYSSINIA.    Arms  Traffic. The  Foreign Office telegraphed to Mr. Thesiger  on  the 21st April[No. 30] that the French Government  had suggested that advantage should be taken of the fact  that Ras  Taffari was about  to ask the Entente Powers for further arms and munitions (of which the French  Minister at Adis Ababa  had  informed his Government)to obtain from the Abyssinian Government a promise to order arms  only  through theAllied Governments,  and not direct from private persons  or firms.  The Italian Govern-ment agreed to this ; and Mr. Thesiger was asked whether he concurred, or was still ofthe opinion that no further consignments  of arms  should be  allowed to enter thecountry, even if destined for Ras Taffari.                                     SYRIA.    Italian Troops for Service  in Syria. Sir R.  Rodd telegraphed on the 22nd April[No. 352] that  he had been informed  by the Ministry of War that  the  detachmentfor Syria would consist of about 400  men (300 infantry and 100  carabinieri), with tenofficers.    Jemal Pasha. An agent reports that Jemal Pasha  is ruling Syria with  an  ironhand, having the power of life  and death.  As an illustration of his arbitrary methods       [898-40]                                  -                     B 2
the agent mentions the following episode.   Recently. Jemal sent word to the family ofa  pretty Jewish girl  :whom . he had met in Jerusalem  that if. she  did not join - hisharem the family would be exiled and she taken by force ;  she joined the harem.                                    ARABIA.Asm.     Agreement with   Idrisi. The  Secretary  to the  Foreign  Department  of  theGovernment of India telegraphed to the Resident at Aden on the .10th March  that  theagreement with&apos;&apos;,Tdhsi concluded on. the  22nd January last [Eastern Report V, p. 5,and Appendix] had been approved by the Governor-General in Council.     Turkish Reverse. The G.O.C. telegraphed on the 23rd April that it was reported from  Perim that the Turks had lost two guns and forty men in Idrisi&apos;s country.ADEN.    Military  Demonstration. on  the  Wadi  Bana,fEast  of Aden). -The  Residenttelegraphed on the  19th April that1 the  33rd Punjabis had made a demonstration,  thepolitical effect  of which, in  the opinion of  the Resident, should be considerable,heartening the local Arabs, increasing our own and lowering the  Turkish prestige ; and again on the 21st April that the Punjabis had destroyed a grain  store, a tower used asa Turkish dep6f, and two guns belonging to a  hostile  Sultan, and had captured 6,000rounds of Turkish ammunition.                                MESOPOTAMIA.    The Indian Journalists. On.  the  18th  April  the G.O.C. telegraphed fromBaghdad that  in accordance with the  instructions he  had received he  had arranged for a  tour of the Kut, battlefield with  an escort, and  a. specially qualified officer asguide.  The press party however had declined, saying that, while thanking him for  thearrangements he  had made,  they considered that, in  view of the greater  importance ofrecent developments, the suggested visit to old battlefields was  of no public  interest.They expressed their indignation at and  dissatisfaction  with the telegram  from theSecretary&apos; of State, and said that, unless  permission were granted within thirty-sixhours to proceed without further delay to Baghdad and the Tigris  front, in accordancewith the programme originally sanctioned by the G.O.C., they requested  that  arrange-ments might be made  for  their immediate  return to India.  They wished  further  topoint out that the tour had been  undertaken by  specially selected  papers at the invitation of the Government ; and  the political effect  of the  present  fiasco on thepublic of India would be anything  but favourable, since  the press, after much waste of time, had been denied any opportunitj?- of. remedying the unfortunate impressionproduced by earlier failures.    The G.O.C. said that the tour proposed by him  to which reference was made wasto proceed to Baghdad direct, then  to  visit the  Tigris front, and afterwards  to  seeNasiriyah.    The Viceroy telegraphed on the  19th April to  the  Secretary of State  that  hisGovernment was of opinion that there would he little further  harm resulting from thepress  party proceeding  to Baghdad and  the Tigris front if a tactful officer were selected:to conduct the tour with clear, instructions to  limit its  scope, as  originally  intended,:viz., to seeing sights, of military interest and inspecting the conditions under which, the .troops were  operating in Mesopotamia, with a view to  making them  known to theIndian public.  His, Government  fully  endorsed  the &apos; point  made  in the  concluding paper of the,protest.made, by the press party.:..                              .,.    Having received the  above telegrams the  Secretary of State  telegraphed on the,,19th April saying that it was a great misfortune that the views of the G.O.C. and theC.P.O. had not been fully explained to him in the first instance, and that they had not agreed on a  policy  before the tour started.  Understanding that the G.O.C. wished  his original proposal to be,followed, he cancelled his orders and left  him full discretion  tocarry through  the tour as,he thought best after consultation  with  the C.P.Q.  Special.pfecaufions&quot;would be needed to meet the latter&apos;s.difficulties,i He might explain,.to the,Arabs &quot;that the &quot;visit had no political significance ;  it was merely a visit which had been.,arranged for the journalists of the nearest  portion of  the  British Empire which  had a newspaper... press.,  It was,, desirable,, he  added, to avoid, as far  as possible, any discussion in the, Indian press of the future of &quot;Mesopotamia pending the decision of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.
     In regard to this, the G.O.C. telegraphed on the 20th April that he had agreed tothe  inclusion of representatives of  vernacular papers in view of the wishes expressedby the Government of India and the Secretary of State, though originally he was notin favour of a visit from them.  The advance on Baghdad had  changed the situation ;and  having regard to the policy expressed in the proclamation, Sir Percy Cox&apos;s argumenthad  considerable weight, though from the  military aspect  there was no objection totheir proceeding to Baghdad, and the  upstream of Baghdad to the battle-fronts.  he therefore considered  that as they had come to Mesopotamia  they should  be allowed to&quot;complete the tour.,-  Major Pulley would be instructed  to explain  the inadvisability ofany  discussion of future  policy in  regard to Mesopotamia,  either  locally with theinhabitants or in the press.     Administration of the Baghdad Vilayet. Sir P. Cox telegraphed on the 20th  April[T.  1254],  in reply to enquiry of the Secretary of State, made on the  12th April, inregard  to  the personnel of the old Administration,  He said that the administrativepersonnel was about 120 in number; all the leading officials, about twenty in number,were Turks, who had all gone ; the remaining 100 were not Turks  and were of  variousdenominations;  forty-eight of them  remained.   The Turks had been careful to takeaway any officials who might be expected to be of use. The executive personnel (deputywali, mutessarifs, mudirs, &amp;c.) was about fifty  in  number, half of  them Turks;  all had gone.                                     PERSIA.     Effect of the Action of Russian Socialists. Sir C. Marling said that the vagaries ofthe. representatives  of  the Committee of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Delegates [ante, p. 2]were having their  effect  on  Persia and  were  encouraging the movement in favourof the convocation of the Mejlis [Eastern Beport, XII, p. 6].     Proposed neio Anglo-Russian  Agreement. The Foreign Office telegraphed to sir g. Buchanan  on the 23rd April [No. 780] in regard to his telegram of  the 9th April[Eastern Report, XI,  p.  5],  pointing out that delimitation  on  ethnographical and geographical lines might indicate an intention on the part of the Prussian Government toembrace within  their sphere the whole  Bakhtiari  country, which would  bring  them down to Dizful, on the  Karun, thus securing a Russian outlet on to the  Gulf  In anycase, Sir G. Buchanan was  to be careful not to commit His Ma,jesty&apos;s Government to negotiations while the political outlook in Prussia remained so uncertain.   This telegram was repeated to Teheran, and at the same time Sir 0. Marling was instructed [No. 123]to obtain  from the Russian Minister, on his return, some  indication as to what wasmeant by  delimitation on ethnographical and geographical grounds,     Railway from  Bunder-Abbas to Kerman. The Foreign Office telegraphed toSir  C.  Marling on  the 19th April [No. 116] that  he might intimate to the RussianMinister that the British Government considered itself&apos; free to apply for this line. PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN.      Withdrawal of Major Keyes&apos; Mission. The  Foreign Department of the Govern- ment of India sent a despatch on the 21st March to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir  J ohn Ramsay, agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in  Baluchistan, informing him that the Government  of India had decided  that Major  Keyes&apos; mission  should, for the  time  being  at any  rate,  be disbanded.   Should  Plis  Majesty&apos;s Government eventually agree with the Indian Government that the only hope  for  the establish- ment of peace and  order in  Persian  Baluchistan lay in the establishment of  Persian authority  with the  assistance and for a time under the aegis  of  the Indian Govern- ment,  the  mission could be reformed and  once  more  enter  Persian Baluchistan. It was realised  at  the same time that the good effects of the mission  might  to some extent be lost  if it were to be disbanded and Major  Keyes  were  to go off without any further communication being made to the Chiefs  with  whom  he  had  recently been  in contact.   Unless, therefore,  Sir J.  Ramsay  should see   any objection,  it was suggested  that Major Keyes  should send letters in the  following  sense to such of the Chiefs  of Persian Baluchistan as  he might  consider desirable.   He should inform  them that  since his return  he had been in consultation with Sir  J. Bamsay and with the Government of India in regard to  the affairs  of Persian Baluchistan ; that the attitude of the Government of India towards the Chiefs and people  in that
region was  sympathetic and friendly,  and  that  its  only desire was to see such *-arrangements made as would ensure  the future peace  and prosperity of that region and. of its  own  borders.   To this  end  it proposed  shortly to move His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to address the Persian Government  on  the  subject, in  the hope that thelatter would see its way  to establishing an effective aud  sympathetic administration inPersian Baluchistan.  The Chiefs of Persian Baluchistan must, however, understandthat the advice  which   His Majesty&apos;s Government  would give would depend  largely upon  their own  behaviour.   If they  continued  to  behave well and to  maintain thepeace of the border and avoid intertribal quarrels,  which could only result in generaldisorder, they might be sure  that  the  British Government would do its  utmost to seethat their interests  were  observed  and  their  liberties  secured; if,  on  the otherhand, they allowed the country to fall back into a state of disorder and lawlessness theBritish Government would have no alternative but to press  the  Persian Government toimpose a much stricter and firmer  form of administration and to assist them to do so.He felt sure  that the Chiefs would accept this friendly warning,  and  that when he himself or some other representative  of the British Government returned  again to visitthem in their own country, as he hoped would be the case after a few months, it wouldbe found that they had  scrupulously followed his advice and thereby served their own interests best.  .                                   INDIA.    The Coming  Pilgrimage to  Mecca. The  &quot;Viceroy telegraphed  on the  9th Aprilsaying that the Indian Government thought that a limited pilgrimage should be againpermitted,  though the shipping agents&quot; had pointed out that there would be considerabledifficulty in  finding  steamers.    The  Government  proposed  to issue  the  followingcommunique&quot;:          &quot;Government  of India have been considering arrangements for  pilgrimage to    Mecca.  Shortage of shipping at  Bombay, as elsewhere, is  at present, however, a    serious obstacle, and, as far as can be foreseen, is likely  to  remain so.   If present    conditions continue, therefore, it will only be possible to  arrange this year  for a    very reduced pilgrimage traffic,  and, though every endeavour will be made to    arrange for as many pilgrim ships as possible, intending pilgrims are warned that    it is probable requisite number  of ships will not  be forthcoming, and in any case    they must be prepared  for possibility of considerable delay  at Bombay.   It is    particularly regretted that shortage of shipping should have  proved such an obstacle    in the pilgrimage just at a time when the Government of India are assured in    Hejaz itself every arrangement has been made by  King of  Hejaz for satisfactory    performance of the  pilgrimage.&quot;    Mr.  Chamberlain telegraphed his approval  on  the 24th  April  adding that theViceroy would recognise  the absolute necessity, owing to the shortage of tonnage, of restricting  the pilgrimage within the narrowest limits practicable.5P.printed AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C.
