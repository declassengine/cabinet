SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE  ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT,  No. XIV.                                        RUSSIA.       THE  political situation in Russia, both as  regards  internal and more especially  external policy, still gives rise to very serious apprehension.  The loss of Mush and the  inactivity  of  the  Caucasus armies  does not encourage  one  regarding  the  military  situation.  It is clear that the  Extremists have power to  dictate the foreign policy of  the Provisional Government, and that any attempt to force M.  Miliukoff&apos;s  hand into  making a public or even diplomatic declaration regarding &quot; annexation &quot; or &quot; liberation &quot;  would be disastrous.  The reception accorded to French and British labour men has not  been all that could  be wished or was hoped for, and even the warmest well-wishers of  tbe new  regime cannot help seeing the danger of  the present situation as  affecting the  war.   An improvement in the discipline and morale of the armies at the front cannot  long  avail if the Extremists  are  in a position to control the dep6ts,  railways, and  telegraphs.  There is still hope that the mass of  the  Russian people outside Petrograd  will realise the external and internal dangers  that  confront the country, but it is clear  that  in.  Petrograd  there are powerful factors making for  disruption and a separate  peace, and  that the Provisional Government  is  still  powerless to deal effectively with  such factors.I                                        PERSIA.      The Persian situation shows signs of increasing difficulty; but we need not  over-1  estimate the power of Persia to do  us any very great  harm even if matters turn out forI  the worst.  The position may be briefly summarised as follows.  The present PersianI  Government is genuinely pro-Entente.  The repercussion of the Russian revolution has  fostered  those anti-Government elements which would  become  more powerful if  aI  Medjliss  were  to meet.   It would be  difficult to  prevent the election of persons to theI  Medjliss  who from their past are known to be Germanophil.  The head of the so-calledI  German  nationalists is now ambassador  in Berlin.  Germanophil policy in PersiaI  makes for chaos, disorder, and  misgovernment in  order that trouble may be  stirred upI against us and the Russians.  Our hope is that the Russian Government will do nothingI to embarrass the present  -pro-Entente Persian Government or to create  a divergenceI between  British and Russian policy.   In a country such as Persia, where there are no1  railways, where highway robbery is all too easy, where religious fanaticism  still insists  on no mosque being ever entered by a Christian, and  where tbe politician takes a veryg different view of bribery and corruption from that obtaining  in the West, we shouldg hesitate  before committing ourselves  to any belief that democratic institutions can beB applied with either ease or success.I         [898-41.]

                               SYRIA AND ARABIA.                    ..........    The provision of gold from Egypt for use by the French in Syria and the visit ofColonel Sir Mark Sykes to the King of the Hejaz at Jeddah suggest two comments on questions very closely allied :     First, unless the expenditure of this gold is very carefully handled, it may, in theevent of our advance  through Palestine  being  held  up, lead to  further  atrocities byJemal  Pasha.   The tale  of executions, deliberate starvation, and deportations by thelatter is already a heavy one.  His latest victims have been the Palestinian Jews;  andthe Jews of Jaffa  and Haifa are now receiving  the same  treatment as was  metedout to  the Armenians by  the  C.U.P.  leaders earlier in the  war.   The inhumanbarbarities of the present rulers  of Turkey  call for  speedy vengeance.   These  newpogroms in Palestine should awaken some previous supporters of the Young Turks totheir real character, and the  ranks of those who, like the Arabs, are  of the opinion,&quot; delendi sunt,&quot; are likely  to receive valuable reinforcement.    Second, King Hussein has always shown  himself the trusting Ally of the British.In his dealings with Colonel Bremond he  has been &quot;straight&quot; to say the least of it.Now that Baghdad is occupied by the British and matters go but slowly in the Hejazhis eyes are upon Syria, and more especially upon the first real capital of the ArabianEmpire,  Damascus.   The future of  the Arab movement  and its foreign relations are bound up with the status  of Damascus, and upon the  success or otherwise of  Sir MarkSykes&apos;s discussions with King Hussein depends the political attitude of the latter.   by placing himself at the head of the Arab movement  King  Hussein engaged in a greatadventure, and  anything  that tends to discourage him now might  have importantconsequences.   The message that Sir Mark Sykes is to convey from His Majesty king george will be very highly valued indeed, and may very materially assist  his otherwisesomewhat difficult diplomatic task.

On the  25th AprilSir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 572] that he thought it only right to give a warning ofthe capital which, if it is not proposed to give Russian subjects an  option of returning  toRussia, might be made by the extreme socialists here out of this agreement.   It  mightbe said that we had proposed it  without any intention  of fulfilling our part of it  asregarded repatriating Russian subjects, though we  had  managed to  find means  to repatriate  our  own.   He .would  strongly urge  that Russian subjects should be given their choice  of returning  to  Russia to  serve.  The  difference of  pay in the two armieswould probably prevent most of  them from electing to serve in Russia, and as it would,in any case, be necessary to provide transport for British subjects  returning to England,it should be possible to send in the vessel intended to convey the  latter, at any rate, acertain number of the Russians who might wish to return to Russia.     Telegraphing again. [No. 574], later on the same day, he said that, on  his conimu-nicating to M.  Miliukoff that morning the text of the draft agreement, his Excellencyhad  told him that  the proposal  was meeting with strong opposition in the Council  ofMinisters,  and that  his  colleagues  were insisting that  facilities should be  given  to russian subjects  in  England to return for service in the Russian army;  adding thatthe Socialists would at once begin an agitation  against us were the impression to gainground that Russians had been enrolled in the British army without having been giventhe  chance of returning home.    Sir G. Buchanan  told him  that  it  was absolutelyimpossible  for us to attempt to repatriate some 30,000 Russians, and, after some furtherconversation, M. Miliukoff  had  said that he would examine the draft agreement and discuss it with  his colleagues.  Meanwhile, he would urge  that  His Majesty&apos;s  Govern-ment should  try and  ascertain how many Russians of military age would opt for service with the British army and how many would  prefer to return to  Prussia.  A choice, hesaid, might also be given of serving with the Russian troops in France.  It  was, in any       [898-41]                                                            B
  case, necessary,  in order to avoid an outburst of Socialist  resentment, that  some of  those who wished  to return  to Russia should be repatriated as a proof of our good  intentions       Sir  G. Buchanan  entirely shared  this view.  The situation, he  said, was  stillV precarious, and those members of the British colony who lived  near their factories were  very nervous about the attitude of their workmen.  He would suggest that we should  inform the Bussian Government that, as soon as Archangel was opened, we would give  such  facilities  as we  could  for the  return of those  who opted  for service in Russia,  explaining, however, that tonnage difficulties would prevent our doing so on a large  scale.       Complaints  against the British Government. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the  24th  April [No.  568] that,  as a report  was being widely  spread that the British  Government had detained and even  arrested Russian  Socialists on  account  of their  political views,  he  had made  a public statement in  a speech  on  the  24th  April  at a meeting of the Anglo-Russian Society  to  the  effect that,  as  regarded  the  latter  accusation, England had always given a  safe asylum to political refugees of all shades  of opinion ;  and as regarded detention, he had received a telegram from his Government  to  the effect that it was not on  account  of the political sentiments that  Russian  refugees had been refused  visa, but because of a want of transport facilities.  He had  concluded  by saying  that it  was true that  certain refugees,  suspected of  German  sympathies,  had been detained  at  Halifax  by  the  local  authorities,  pending  communication  with  Russian Government, but as soon  as the wishes of that  Govern-  ment had been made  known orders had been sent to release them.       He telegraphed  again on the 26th April [No. 578] in regard to the same matter,  saying  that attacks  continued to  be  made  on   us for detaining  Russian  political  refugees, even by moderate Labour organs, in spite  of the statement  he had published  in the press.  He bad, that morning, called the attention  of M. Miliukoff to  one of  these articles and had said that he  must ask the Provisional Government to  put a  stop to  a  press  campaign which  was rousing public  opinion against England.   On  M. Miliukoff remarking that the Russian Government was being similarly attacked, he  had said that he had no intention of allowing his Government to serve as a lightning  conductor for attacks on Russian Government.  He had on the 8th  April requested  his Government in accordance with M.  MiliukofPs wishes  to  release  the  Russian  Socialists detained at Halifax, but two  days  later M. Miliukoff had asked that they  should not be allowed  to  proceed until  the Russian  Government had been furnished  with more detailed information concerning them ; it was in consequence of this request  that orders for their release had to be postponed until  the  21st April.  He should be  obliged to publish the above facts, unless the Russian  Government made it  quite clear  by some statement in the press  that  His Majesty&apos;s Government had  not refused.the  visa of the passport  of any Russian political refugee presented  by Prussian  consular  authorities, and that tonnage difficulties  alone   had i prevented their repatriation.  M. Miliukoff promised ,to publish, such;  a statement, but  again expressed a hope that  His Majesty&apos;s Government, would place  a  steamer at the disposal of the refugees to  enable them to return to Russia.  He told  him that this was, he feared, impossible at  present.      Sir  G.. Buchanan added  that  a good  impression  would be  created if we could  hold out hopes  of repatriating  some of  them when Archangel opens;  also it was most  important to avoid doing  or saying anything calculated to give offence  to the  extreme  left parties.      On  the 27th April he  telegraphed [No. 586] that M. MiliukofF had, in  accordance,  with his promise, published a statement saying that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs  felt it a  duty to.state clearly that the British: authorities had  in  every case promptly  fulfilled  the request  made by the Bussian Government, and that detention was due to  tbe necessity of exchanging  telegrams  on the subject.  Sir  G.  Buchanan, however,  thought it  advisable that Captain Smith.should call on the editors of the &quot; Pravda &quot;and  the &quot; Workmen&apos;s Gazette &quot; to explain the true facts of the case and to ask them to publish  a more detailed statement which he had  prepared.   The  former promised  to publish it  in abridged  form, and the latter textuallv.  The editor of the  &quot; W&quot;orkmen&apos;s Gazette &quot;  argued, that, though we found it possible to give facilities to Paklanoff and our work-  men^ delegates who went to Petrograd to preach a  continuance of the war, we refused  them to those who were working  for  peace.  He added that  he should continue the  agitation until  we had given transport facilities to all who wished to return.       Telegraphing on  the 28th April [No. 592] Sir G. Buchanan  said that an explanatory
o                                                                              186^statement had been published in the &quot;Workmen&apos;s Gazette,&quot; but it merely served for a,  fresh attack on His Ma]esty&apos;s. Government and himself.      Council of Workmen, dec.,1 and Annexation.Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the  3.0th April [No. 599];saying that at  a meeting of the Council of Workmen, and Soldiers&apos;  Deputies, held on  the  29th  April to discuss the attitude of the  Council towards the  new war loan, it was decided that its attitude should depend on the;  action to be taken  by the Provisional  Government in regard to peace terms; the idea being  that it would  not support the loan if  those terms  included any annexation conditions.   The Council  accordingly approached the  Provisional Government on the subject, and was informed  that the whole question of annexation was under consideration, and  that &quot;a  decision  as  to the practical results which  must  arise  from  the Governments declaration of  abandoning all aims of  annexation &quot; would be come to within the next three days.      Complaint that Russians  are  refused British Commissions. Lord  Robert Cecil  informed  Sir G. Buchanan on the 27th April [No. 825] that M.  Partorganeff, a barrister,  had telegraphed to the  Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs and War, and to the Council  of  Workers&apos; Deputies, complaining that Prussians, although recommended, were refused  commissions in the British  army,  which  created  discontent;  and instructed  him to  explain to M. Miliukoff that  commissions could not be  given to any foreigner owing to  the provisions of the Act of  Settlement, which rule applied to all persons not of British  nationality, and  to ask him  to explain the  matter to the Minister  of War  and the  Council of Workers&apos; Deputies.      False Telegram  as to a proposed Note. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed  on.  the  26th April [No.&quot; 581] that the attention of M. Miliukoff had been called, by himself and  the French  Ambassador, to a statement  which had  been telegraphed abroad  by  the &apos; official agency  that the  Provisional Government proposed to address a note to the allied  Governments explaining its views more fully on the aims of war in conformity with the  declaration  already published respecting  peace  without annexations  or  contributions.  M. Miliukoff said that this was the first he had  heard of such a note.  He spoke in  depressed terms of his position, and said that this was evidently an  attempt  to force  his hands.  Sir  G. Buchanan said that M. Miliukoff had so little  influence in  the  Government that, as is  more  than likely, should  he go he would  not be a great loss.  Although he was our staunch ifiend, he was deplorably weak.      Telegraphing again on the 27th April [No. 587], he said that an official denial of  the proposed  note had been sent  abroad ;  also that M.  Kerensky appeared  to be  responsible for the statement.      Attack on the English.  Labour Delegates. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the  28th April [No. 592] that his attention had been drawn, by a French Socialist who was  there to maintain contact with Russian Labour parties, to  a violent  attack which the  &quot;Pravda&quot; had made on our Labour delegates in consequence of a message sent by the  Independent  Labour  Party  in  London to a Russian Socialist, to the effect that our  delegates did  not  represent  British labour, but were emissaries  of the imperialist  British Government, by whom all their expenses were paid.   He had, he said, caused a  statement to be published explaining that our delegates were wprkingmen, who  repre-  sented  a  Labour Party, which counted over two  million members.   Mr. Thorne was,  moreover, sole  representative of Social Democratic tendencies in British Parliament.  He bad  urged Sir G.  Buchanan to have a telegram sent by  the  Labour Party to  M. Kerensky putting the matter in its  true light.  It would also, he thought,  do good  if Mr. Hyndman would also telegraph to M. Kerensky, explaining Mr. Thorne&apos;s  position  and views.  Sir G. Buchanan said that he should be glad if this  could be arranged at  once and  copies of telegrams  sent to him  for publication in  the press.  We are being  made the subject of such constant attacks in the Socialist Press that we could not afford  to pass over in silence the statement of the &quot; Pravda.&quot;      The  Foreign Office telegraphed on the  30th April to Sir G. Buchanan [No. 842]  that  the  following message had   been   sent  to M.  Kerensky : &quot; Contradict  most  emphatically  the lying statement  of the Independent Labour Party that  Thorne  and 0&apos;Grady  do  not  fully  represent British  labour.   They  act  for  and represent  organised labour in Great Britain as completely  as any workingmen  could possibly do.  I have worked side by side with Thorne for thirty-five years as a thorough-going Social  Democrat. He has done magnificent work for his class as Member of Parliament and as secretary  of by far the  strongest unskilled labour union in this country.   He has never
given way in the least.  0&apos;Grady I have  known almost equally well for many years.He, too, has steadily fought the good fight for political, social, and economic freedom.You can implicitly rely upon them both.   As an  old  and intimate friend of  threegenerations of Russian revolutionaries, I assure you the overwhelming majority of ourworking people are  quite determined  to  win  this war against German militaristautocracy and scientific barbarism.  They look to all workers and comrades in Russia tostrengthen their great and glorious  revolution, which  has immensely encouraged us all,by organising as one solid mass the Prussian democracy in arms to repulse and vanquishthe German invaders and to co-operate with the democracies of Europe, America, andAustralnaia in establishing a permanent peace.

Barclay telegraphed on the &quot;24th April [No. 208]that  there  had been  a Cabinet  crisis,  which had fortunately  passed;  the  present parliament  was elected in the  spring of 1914 as  a Constituent  Parliament to makenecessary changes in the constitution ; after a short preliminary discussion in the springsession it adjourned, intending to deal with the matter in the autumn, but the outbreakof war  led to a postponement of the  drastic  constitutional  changes  contemplated.The question  ]&amp;j dormant until events in Russia led the Prime  Minister to go a stepfurther  towards the execution  of his programme,  and the King&apos;s recent promises ofallotments  of  land  to  peasants  and  of  universal suffrage foreshadowed early action byM.  Bratiano, who  had, however, found  it difficult  to bring all  the members  of theCabinet  into  line  with  him.    The  Cabinet as  reconstructed last  winter  containedConservative elements, and although these  realised that reforms had to come they hadbean  working hard to limit  their scope, even  threatening resignation. They  had,hovrever, found the  King solid with M. Bratiano, and had now abandoned their intentionof resigning. . A Cabinet  Council was  held under the presidency of the King, and itwas decided that  Parliament should sit in May to vote the necessary measures which involve  direct ami  universal  suffrage as well as distribution 3,000,000 hectares of landamong the  peasants.  The  land  is  to be  taken from the Crown lands, the State lands,and the properties of the larger landowners, who are to be expropriated to  the extent of something like two-thirds of their  properties, payment being made in State bonds to be redeemed by  instalments  from  peasants.   There is, of course, no  idea  of  executingreforms  until after the war.     The Railways. General  de Candolles  telegraphed  on the 24th April from  Jassy[No. 209] that his mission had been well received by all concerned ;  General SakharofFssuccessor, however,  had not arrived, and would not  do so for a  few days.   Changes, hesaid, had been effected in the  higher personnel  of  the Rumanian railways  some twomonths  ago, and the work of the joint Russian and Rumanian Commission, now preside over by  the Russian Colonel Serebianikov,  was gradually bringing about a genuineimprovement  in the railway  situation,  although  very  much  remained  to  be  done.Various projects of double-tracking and construction were in progress, but the progress was slow, for lack of men and materials.  The immediate causes of  anxiety, however,were in  regard to the supply of  equipment and of  sundry materials for current repairs to locomotives.  General de Candolles was having both closely investigated.                                     EGYPT.     French Gold  Requirements. Sir R. Wingate  telegraphed  on the 28th  April[No. 473], with reference to proposed gold payments to France, explaining the present-position of Egypt in regard to gold.  He said that the amount of gold in National Bank
                                                                     .&quot;      187 WAS  2,18O,000Z., OF WHICH 2,033,000Z. WAS IN SOVEREIGNS.  GOLD EARMARKED IN london was 3,285,000/,.  ; tbe ISSUE WAS 20,350,000Z., SHOWING  LITTLE OR NO SIGNS OF DIMINISHING, WHILE A LARGE INCREASE IN THE AUTUMN WAS INEVITABLE.   THE DEMAND  FOR SILVER WAS  INCESSANT. GOLD IN THE BAZAAR WAS AT A PREMIUM OF 2-J PER CENT.     MORE THAN 125000Z. HAD BEEN TAKEN BY HIM FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES IN HEJAZ, AND THIS MIGHT HAVE TO BE INCREASED  TO  200,000Z. AND MORE.  IF THE FRENCH  REQUIREMENTS WERE ALSO TO BE MET, IT MUST BE (? WITH) THE RESERVATION THAT IN A VERY FEW MONTHS&apos; TIME THERE would BE NO GOLD  AT ALL left IN RESERVE IN EGYPT.  SUCH A SITUATION would BE DANGEROUS IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE IN VIEW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING TO USE GOLD FOR THE PURCHASE  OF SILVER OR TO REDUCE EVENTUALLY THE PREMIUM ON GOLD, OR FOR BRITISH ARMY  PURCHASES  IN the SOUDAN.   THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE FELT THAT THE DRAFTS OF GOLD TAKEN OUT OF EGYPT OUGHT TO BE REPLACED IN EGYPT; BUT IF THIS  WAS IMPOSSIBLE, IT SHOULD NOT IN ANY CASE BE SUCH AS TO REDUCE THE RESERVE BELOW 1,000,0OOZ.     IT  WILL THUS BE SEEN THAT WITH  THE  RESERVE  REDUCED TO  the BAREST  MINIMUM, THE BALANCE WOULD  HARDLY MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF HIS  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT FOR  QUITE a short TIME, LEAVING THOSE OF FRENCH GOVERNMENT out OF ACCOUNT.  WITH THESE depleted RESOURCES THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT, IF  THE DECISION were LEFT WITH  IT,  FELT THAT WHILE WILLING  TO DO ALL THEY COULD FOR HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT, THEY COULD NOT ALSO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF A SECOND GOVERNMENT.  THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SHOULD IN THE FIRST INSTANCE USE UP ALL  THE GOLD HELD BY FRENCH  BANKS IN EGYPT.  THE AMOUNT WAS NOT KNOWN PRECISELY, BUT IT WAS APPRECIABLE.  AS A SECOND RESORT THEY SHOULD SEND THEIR OWN GOLD  FROM  FRANCE.   IF IN THE LAST RESORT SOME  HELP WAS NECESSARY, THE UTMOST EGYPT COULD DO  WOULD BE  TO  MEET  THE URGENT REQUIREMENTS OF  FRENCH  AGENTS AGAINST THE EARMARKING OF A CORRESPONDING AMOUNT  IN SOVEREIGNS IN  PARIS, WHICH THE  FRENCH GOVERNMENT WOULD DEFINITELY UNDERTAKE TO SHIP TO  EGYPT ON  DEMAND IF  AND WHEN REQUIRED AT THEIR OWN RISK AND EXPENSE.     SIR R. WINGAFCE ADDED THAT HE MUST  POINT OUT THAT BY THE END OF THE YEAR THE NOTE ISSUE MIGHT EASILY EXPAND TO OVER 30,000,000Z. AGAINST A GOLD RESERVE OF ABOUT 4,000,000Z. ONLY.  SUCH  A   SITUATION WAS  FULL OF OBVIOUS DANGERS AND HE WOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW WHETHER IN CASE OF A  PANIC, OF WHICH THERE HAD BEEN NO  SIGN HITHERTO, THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT MIGHT COUNT UPON THE SUPPORT OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                                  ABYSSINIA.     Arms   Traffic. IN  REPLY TO  THE  FOREIGN  OFFICE TELEGRAM  NO.  30 - [EASTERN BEPORT  XIII, P. 3], MR. THESIGER TELEGRAPHED ON THE 26TH APRIL [NO. 31] SAYING THAT TRAFFIC SHOULD BE REGULATED BEFORE PERMISSION WAS GRANTED, AND  HE PROPOSED THAT      1.  THE ABYSSINIAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAND  OVER AN EQUAL NUMBER OF OLD RIFLES           FOR DESTRUCTION IN RETURN FOR EACH CONSIGNMENT OF NEW RIFLES.     2.  ARMS SHOULD BE ORDERED  ONLY  THROUGH  ALLIED GOVERNMENTS,  AND NOT THROUGH           PRIVATE PERSONS.     3.  THERE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION FOR  ANY FIRM OR PRIVATE PERSON IN  ABYSSINIA           TO SELL ARMS, WITH A DEFINITE PENALTY ATTACHED.     ON THE SAME DAY HE  TELEGRAPHED [NO. 32], SAYING THAT  THE ITALIAN MINISTER CONCURRED IN HIS OPINION THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT FRANCE SHOULD CLOSE THE ARMS TRAFFIC AT JIBUTI AFTER THE WAR IF THE  CONTRABAND TRAFFIC  WAS TO END.                                    ARABIA. HEJAZ.     Sir Mark  Sykes  and  King Hussein. SIR  R.  WINGATE  TELEGRAPHED   ON  THE 27TH  APRIL  [NO. 464] THAT KING HUSSEIN, HAVING  HEARD  THAT SIR  M. SYKES  WAS IN EGYPT,  HAD EXPRESSED  A  STRONG  DESIRE  TO  SEE  HIM;  CONSEQUENTLY  SIR  MARK WOULD leave EGYPT ON the  30TH  APRIL  for  Jeddah, where the  meeting would take nlace. SIR R. Wingate ASKED WHETHER IT WOULD  BE POSSIBLE TO ASK HIS MAJESTY  THE KING TO SEND A MESSAGE OF GOOD WISHES AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO KING HUSSEIN BY SIR MARK SYKES. ON THE 28TH APRIL  THE FOREIGN OFFICE  REPLIED [NO.  442] THAT  SIR&apos; MARK SYKES  WAS AUTHORISED TO CONVEY TO KING HUSSEIN  A MESSAGE OF  GOOD  WISHES AND  ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE KING IN STRICTLY NON-COMMITTAL TERMS.     ON THE 28TH APRIL SIR R. WINGATE FURTHER  TELEGRAPHED [NO. 472] THAT HE SHOULD INSTRUCT SIR  MARK SYKES: (F) TO  EXPLAIN THAT,  WHILST THE  ALLIES WERE DETERMINED TOSUPPORT ARAB RACE ASPIRATIONS, THE AUTHORITY OF KING  PLUSSEIN COULD  NOT BE IMPOSED      [898-41]                                                         C

PERSIA.    Internal  Political  Condition. Sir C.  Marling  telegraphed on  the  25th April[No. 145] that there was a growing agitation in  favour  of an immediate election, and though the Cabinet was persuaded that the Mejlis could only result  in anarchy, in theabsence of support  from the Shah,  it was  powerless  to resist.  With  the exception ofthe Prime Minister and one or two other Ministers, everyone from the Shah downwardswas seeking to evade  the responsibility of taking any decision on the question of theMejlis and the elections.   These questions had been  referred by the Shah  to a small committee of timid, moderate men ;  by them it was referred to a  larger committee,which recommended  a  reference  to ex-deputies of former  Parliaments, present inTeheran, i.e., to the  professional politicians who formed the bulk of the pro-GermanDemocrat party whose decision was a foregone conclusion.  The Cabinet would be forcedto resign, and would probably be succeeded by a  Mustoffiul  Mamalik  combination suchas produced the chaos in the autumn of 1915 ;  the pro-German leaders who fled withthe German Minister  in November  1915 would return, and  their intrigues would causeus great embarrassment in Southern Persia.   Sir E.  Marling said that  he was doing what he  could to  prevent any decision  being  taken before the Russian  ProvisionalGovernment had declared ; but  if there was likely to be any  delay, he hoped that theRussian Minister would return at once, as his presence would do  a good deal to steadyopinion.     On the 28th April the Foreign  Office  telegraphed  to&apos; Sir  G. Buchanan [No. 834]instructing him to inform the Russian Government of the condition of affairs in Persia,and to urge that the Russian Minister should at once be sent  back to Teheran with instructions to maintain a strong  attitude,  and to act in  concert with  the british minister so that a situation of chaos, which must otherwise recur, might be prevented.     Sir  G. Buchanan telegraphed  on the  80th April [No. 603)  that he had  discussed the matter with M. Miliukoff, who had said that he would send back the Russian minister as soon as possible, and instruct him  to consult with Sir C. Marling  as to our attitude.He saw, however, great difficulties in the way of our either preventing a return to public life of the officials or deputies referred to, or of  opposing the convocation of the Mejlis.   Ifthe Mejlis met, he did not see how we could prevent  any deputies to  whom we objectedfrom  taking part in its discussions.  He was evidently  afraid of what the Socialists inPetrograd would say  if he identified himself with an anti-Liberal policy in Persia.   Heremarked that the British and  Bussian rdles in Persia  had  been reversed, and  if hefollowed our advice he would be accused of trying to strangle  the Mejlis.     The Bakhtiari.-Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 24th April [No. 144] that  theBakhtiaris were agitating  to get Zil-es-Sultan and his family ousted, in the belief thatthe Provisional Government  of  Russia would cease from all  interference with  Persia&apos;internal affairs.  Should they succeed, it would be represented as a British success, and,considering the unusually  close touch we now had with the tribe, we should  have  theappearance of  having taken Russia  at a  disadvantage.  Sir C. Marling said  that hecould do little with the Khans,  as,  owing to various cruses, they  were very discontented,and he  had therefore  told the Persian  Government that Akbar, who was governingsatisfactorily in his fathePs name, should  be maintained.     Proposed New  Anglo-Russian  Agreement.  [See  Eastern Report, XL p. 5.]   Inreply to an enquiry from the  Foreign Office  [No. 780], Sir G- Buchanan telegraphed onthe 26th April [No. 582] that the Russian Minister merely meant, when speaking of anethnographical and geographical line, that these  were considerations that must be takeninto account in delimitating our respective  spheres  of  influence.  He was referring tothe  advisability of  not  splitting  up tribes  between two  different  spheres, and moreespecially to  the Ispahan district.   He was speaking on the assumption that the wholeneutral zone would be included in our. sphere.  In saying that he and Sir C. Marlingmight study the whole question and submit  their recommendations, Sir G. Bucbanaifs
idea was that  they should prepare  the  ground  by  furnishing a  basis for futurenegotiations on which the two Governments could enter when the opportune momentcame.     Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 24th April [No.  143] that the  Russian minister had always been most scrupulous in recognising the Bakhtiari as a British interest.     Seistan and Baluchistan Levies. Lord Bobert Cecil telegraphed on the 21st April[No. 119]  to  Sir  C. Marling that His  Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciated hisarguments in favour of an early incorporation, but felt that the immediate requirements would perhaps be met by making a statement to the Persian Government on the  lines suggested in the Viceroy&apos;s  telegram  of the  15th April.  If, therefore, Sir C. Marlingsaw no objection he should proceed accordingly, and, so soon as the considered views ofthe  Government  of India  were received,  Lord Robert Cecil would give furtherconsideration to the question of the future organisation of those levies.     Opium Excise. On the 26th April Lord Robert Cecil telegraphed  to Sir C. Marling[No. 126 I asking him to report the  result of his request for the exclusion of the southernprovinces.  The Acting Secretary of State presumed  that among the provinces to be excluded would be those of Kerman and Seistan.                                AFGHANISTAN.   - Escaped Austrian Prisoners. The Viceroy telegraphed on  the  25th April that,according to a report, dated the 23rd April, which had been received from the assistantpolitical agent in Chitral, fifty-five Germans had reached Faizabad en route to Yarkandvia, Wakhan, coming from Kabul.   These  were doubtless  escaped Austrian prisoners.It was not proposed to make any attempt to intercept them unless they should actuallyenter British territory, but to  let them make their way into China, and to warn theChinese Government.    Niedermayer. The following information comes from  an agent:  (1) Niedermayerstated that he was in command of the mission to Afghanistan, and  made all the arrange-ments for it.  (2) His orders from Berlin were to induce the Amir to attack India.  (3) Hetravelled disguised as an Afghan.   (The agent was  shown photographs of Niedermayerin his &quot; make-up,&quot; which was perfect.)   (4) On his way to Kabul he visited Kushk Post,and thence went by rail to Merv.   The agent understood that Niedermayer returned toKushk Post and continued his journey through northern Afghanistan,   (o) On reachingKabul, Niedermayer openly took up his position as a German officer.  (6)  The  Amirstated that he hated England, and  would be perfectly willing to attack India but for fear of the British  Government.   (7) The  public at  Kabul resented NiedermayePspresence, not as a German, but as a Christian.  For this reason the Amir gave out thatNiedermayer had embraced Islam.   (8)  The agent asked Niedermayer about the Afghanarmy, and Niedermayer stated that the Amir was keeping 150,000 men under arms.These men, he  said, had all  been  trained  to discipline and  could shoot straight.(9) Niedermayer had urged the Amir to send an influential mission to Turkey,  but onlyone &quot; Prince,&quot; a boy of 1 8  or 19, was sent.   He was put up at the Pera Palace (merelya  hotel)  at Constantinople, and was  not treated with  anything like the  courtesyshown to envoys from  Germany or Austria.  Pie is of  no influence  or importance.(10) Niedermayer was thoroughly  disgusted with  what he regarded as the complete failure of his mission to Afghanistan.ADDENDA.                                   RUMANIA.     Visit of Prime Minister to Bussia. Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 30th April, No. 220]  that  the  Prime  Minister had left for  Russia on the previous day.   In a previous telegram he had said that the Prime Minister had told him that  the object ofhis visit was to get into direct touch with the new  Government [No. 211]   During  his absence Mr. Take Jonesco will act as Minister for Foreign Affairs [No. 214].
                                     PERSIA.     Internal  Political  Condition. Lord Robert Cecil telegraphed to Sir C. Marling onthe 2nd May [No. 130] with reference to Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s telegram [No. 603] of the30th April [ante, p. 6].   He suggested  that the position might become clearer whenthe Russian Minister returned to Tehran.  In the meantime he left it to Sir C. Marling&apos;judgment to take what steps  he could to maintain the present Persian Government in power, and to prevent any immediate decision with regard to the Mejlis. He also said thathe realised the exceedingly difficult position in which Sir C. Marling must find himself.But until the situation in Russia had developed there was little use in pressing theRussian Government further in the matter.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. E.

                     MESOPOTAMIA.                Baghdad  and Moslem Feeling.     The influence of the capture of Baghdad on Moslem mindscan hardly be gauged yet by positive evidence.   The local effect has varied necessarily with individual commitments  and hopes.As Basra telegraphs, under date April 1, the provincial chiefs inIraq, who  had compromised themselves  by a friendly attitudetowards us, showed sincere relief at an event which renders thereturn of the Turks highly bmprobable, if not  impossible.  our principal Mesopotamian allies, the Sheikhs of Mohammerah andKoweit, have displayed a joy which is obviously genuine, and if their subjects were not particularly enthusiastic, it matters little,seeing for how much the  ruling  individual counts in the East.Nor can the attitude of other chiefs  and their  subjects, not socommitted previous^, but  now within inevitable reach of our arm,e.g. those on the Euphrates  below  Fellujeh, be otherwise  thanopenly congratulatory.     It is only when we look outside the sphere of the local opera-tions that the question becomes ojDen.   It is interesting, but notin the least unexpected, that the  same Basra telegram, summariz-ing reports from Persia and the Gulf, should draw a  distinctioneverywhere between the  Shiite attitude and the  Sunnite.  TheShiahs are  stated to be delighted by  the news at  Bahrein andBandar Abbas, and pleased in Arabistan and in Southern Persiagenerally.   Merchants foresee renewed and extended facilities for trade ; the educated class hopes to enjoy office again in the ShiahHoly Cities ; the  common folk  expect to be able once more to visit the Holy Shrines in life, and to have conveyance to hallowedearth in death.  This last  consideration, added  to the comfortingreflection that a Sunnite Government, which has always shown itself contemptuous and oppressive towards Shiahs, has ceased to sit astride  the  pilgrim roads, is enough to make the  unorthodoxsection of Islam rejoice at the  fall of Baghdad  ; and, further, itmust be  remembered that  Shiahs, though personally among themost fanatical of Moslems, have not that sense of, or desire for,unitj&apos; in  Islam, or  that  deep craving for  temporal dominion,which actuates Sunnis.   Waiting  for  the  reappearance of the twelfth  Imam,  or  detached  from  practical  politics by trans-cendentalism, they care little if one great city, more or less, passunder Christian government, so  their religion and its observances.remain unhampered.     Not  so the Sunnis.  Whether they  be  friends or foes to us at this moment, to them Baghdad in our hands is one more drearytide-mark  of a receding  flood.   Even King Husein,  hearing the news  at Mecca, commented upon  it to his notables in a spirit ofregretful warning.  This was what came of suffering &quot; Turanians&quot;in a seat of  Moslem  power !  Probably  no sincere Sunni in theworld has  received the  news Avith any feeling more joyful thanchastened  acquiescence, or more salutary than a conviction that
the&apos; Turks have been  backing the wrong horse.   In  Constan-tinople the official revelation  of the disaster is reported to haveprovoked  intense despondency and  to  have been followed by atumult in the  Chamber and  a shower of petitions for peace.At  Lahej, Ali  Said  Pasha, like the stout man he evidently is,communicated  the news to  Arab  chiefs, with an  exhortationto them to stiffen their backs as sole response.   In Egypt,  whilethe  censorship weighs heavily  on the  press, one can learn littleabout popular  sentiment  from journalistic comments ; but themanner,  more than  the  words,  in  which,  on  March  14, a paper of such known Turcophil tendencies as the &quot; Wadi  Nil&quot;twitted Enver with the futility of his past.pledges and his presentexplanations  in regard to Baghdad, was very  significant.   Islamis not despaired of,  but the Turk is ;  and pro-British or  anti-British, the papers throw the blame on  the Germans.   When the news  of Baghdad arrived, the present writer was in an Egyptianprovince far from Cairo.  It was clear that a wide and profoundimpression was caused,  and hardly less clear  that some measureof sadness and disillusion was its immediate consequence.    Indian press comments  are  not  very  enlightening :  butevidently  hope lingers that we may  yet have to retire againfrom  Baghdad.  In due  course  we shall hear, no doubt,  fromother  parts of the Moslem world.   It would be especially interest-ing to be informed about the state of opinion  in Baghdad  itself,when  the  military situation  is  sufficiently established for civil life to resume a measure of freedom.                  Euphrates Route to Syria.[For details of both River and Land Routes, see &quot; Handbook of    Mesopotamia,&quot; Vol.  Ill (Admiralty  War Staff, Intelligence    Division, January 1917), Routes IX E-H ; 46, 47, 48, and    51-59.]    The occupation of  Fellujeh,  43 miles from Baghdad by acarriage  track and a  narrow-gauge  light railway,  puts us inpossession of the head  of the Euphratean routes to Syria.   Thesevary in  length.   It is  470 miles  to  Aleppo, by the  main river-side road via  Meskineh; and  434 miles  to  Damascus,  by the direct desert track which branches off  from  the  river at Hit.Longer  than either, however, is the most travelled and best sup-plied route to  Damascus, which does not branch off from the rivertill Deir ez-Zor, and  covers altogether  559  miles.   There are known direct tracks from Baghdad to Hit and Anah, which avoidFellujeh ; but they save very little in distance, are not recognizedor organized as  through  routes, and have  very uncertain watersupply.   They can therefore be  neglected.  Nor,  for much thesame reasons,  need account be  taken of ti*acks other than  those mentioned above, leading off across the Syrian desert from  various points on the river, e.g. Jibbeh, Abu Kemal, and Raqqah ; theyare too  waterless for any but very small bodies of Beduins.
     In addition, however, to these land routes, there is the riveritself.   Its stream,  if followed right  up to Meskineh,  lengthensthe distance  between Fellujeh and Aleppo to 626 miles.  this increase of  156 miles over  the  marching distance would notcounterbalance its superior usefulness, were the middle Euphratesa good water-way ;  but, in fact,  it is of  such  a  character thatupstream navigation could not be carried on continuously withoutheavy preliminary work on the channel or banks, or the provisionof powerful hauling and warping apparatus, at several intermediatepoints.   Though the Turco-Germans claim to have improved theconditions of navigation during the war, we have no information that they have seriously lessened the difficulties of going upstream.There  are three  very bad stretches :  (1)  some ten miles fromthe rock ledge at Fatihat Khidr Eyas, fifty-nine miles above Hit;(2) from the Bahaleh rapids, two miles above  Anah, onwards  toTazali  Island,  some  twenty  miles ; (3)  the  Hammam rapids,130  miles above  Deir ez-Zor and fifty  miles below  Meskineh.Artificial channels were cut  about forty years ago to help navi-gation at the first two of these points, but they require re-dredgingand  do not circumvent all  the difficulties. These are only the worst among many rapids, obstructed reaches and tortuous shoals.In the flood months May, June, and July there is usually w;aterenough  for a clear run up-river from Fellujeh to  Meskineh and beyond  ; but, at the same season, the current met between Hit andAnah may be of any  strength up to twelve knots. During therest of the  year, one  would always be running aground or onsnags, besides still meeting rapids which call for high power  orhaulage. There are not tow-paths where needed, and, where thereis so little through boat-traffic, there are few or no skilled pilots,except  for  short stretches of  home water, as near Anah.   Asteamer  has been coaxed up  to  Meskineh now and again by arare  tour de force, but no regular up  and down service has ever been maintained ;  the Turks have  tried  motor-boats  betweenFellujeh and Hit and given them up again.     A few clumsy keeled boats  and keelless coracles, smearedwith Hit bitumen, are kept for local fishing and ferrying, but thetypical  Euphratean  craft is the shakhtur, a-rectangular raft witha high  freeboard, roughly but solidly  made.   These  serve fordownstream  conveyance  only, and are rowed by three or fourmen apiece.  Formerly they were made  in Birejik alone, and  on reaching Fellujeh, after a drifting voyage of any  duration fromtwenty to forty days,  according to the strength of the  current atthe season and their weight of freight, they were usually  broken up and  their timbers were sold.  The Turks have used them muchin this  war, for floating down  both men  and  supplies  frOm the bagadad Railway bridge at Jerablus, wdjere Kap.-Lieut. H. vonMiicke, of &quot; Emden&quot; fame,  has  been in charge  of the service.According to Turkish papers and a map captured by I. E. Force&quot; D,&quot;   three  sectional  headquarters  were  established  for this transport service at Meskineh, Deir ez-Zor, and Anah ; and between Birejik and  Bamadiyeh  or  Fellujeh,  some  thirteen landing
stations were provided.   Military shakhturs have usually travelledin pairs, lashed together, each pair being capable of carrying aplatoon of 65 men.  What their total number has been of late isnot known, but in 1914 there were said to have been five hundred.Nor is it known whether, as was  proposed, metal i&quot;afts have  been introduced to supersede wooden shakhturs.  Jerablus has replacedBirejik as the main boat-yard, and relays of trained rowers  havebeen established all down the river.   Kshqkhtur  is built  very quickly,  and unless (as  is probable enough)  timber has  beenscarce, it is not  likely  that empties have  been towed upstreamagain.   To an army, however, advancing or retreating upstream,they would supply very valuable concomitant transport,  couldsmall launches of sufficient power, aided by haulage in the difficultreaches, be found to tow batches  of them.  It should be observedthat the  raft buoyed with inflated goat skins, which is so  muchused on the Tigris, is not in  vogue on the  Euphrates, owing toever present danger of puncture by  rocks and snags.  Sails arenot used, and would in any case be of little service on an upstreamvoyage,, the prevailing winds blowing from north and Avest.     Where a waterway is of such a character as this, there can beno question of an army using it as its main means of transit or eventransport.  Roads along  the banks must be the main avenues of advance, the river serving as the chief source of  water supply.The present writer has drunk unsterilized Euphrates  water, bothbefore  and during flood sea-sons, and found it always both  sweetand wholesome,  though thick.  But well-water is also obtainableat short intervals along&apos; almost all the  route.     The recognized Aleppo track keeps always to the right bank,an alternative left bank path from Anah to Raqqah  offering noadvantages.  It  is not (or was not before the war) metalled, noris it supplied with enough bridges over tributary gulleys, whichoccur with especial frequency  between  Hit and Anah and  aboveDeir-ez-Zor ; but it is practicable for light wheeled traffic through-out,  having no long or steep gradients  (except little gulley-sides)and running over hardish, if stone-strewn,  ground.   In May and june, however, the river-flood cuts it  in places,  and makes thegulleys more  serious obstacles.   About  1907  a  company  was formed for the maintenance of a postal and passenger service bycarriage  between Baghdad and  Aleppo.  To serve its ends, thetrack was improved superficially, some of the worst gulleys  werebridged,  and more, police posts were  established.  The aim of theservice was to do the distance in six clays by relays of horses, and,in fact,  when the present writer vras at Aleppo in  April 1908,our Resident at  Baghdad came  through with his wife  in eight days, but suffered much from the roughness of the road, and thelength of the stages.   The Company maintained  neither its ser-vice  nor its  existence very  long; but its record shows what ispossible without regular  road-making.   Since then motors  have followed the track, one  in particular,  a 40 h.p. Argyll, having
                           Hejaz.                    The  Present  Situation.     Military operations in Hejaz seem to be somewhat hangingfire ;  but  this appearance  is  due  partly  to defects in  our information.   Owing to the distance inland at which  the  forcesof all  four Emirs are operating, we get news less constantly, and rapidly than we did before Medina itself and the railway becametheir immediate objectives.  Moreover,  while the weak wirelessset at  Wejh has not much improved the situation, several  patrolships  have been  withdrawn ;  and  the R.F.C. flight, recentlytransferred to Wejh, has only just got going again, after finding a satisfactory advanced landing ground at Beidha on the northernroad  to  El-Ala (see p.  144).   We do know,  however, that  aconsiderable detachment  from Abdullah&apos;s  force  in Wadi Ais,with  which  Capt. Lawrence  is  at present, has attacked  AbulNairn  station,  under  the lead of Sherif Shakir.  The  latterreports that he destroyed  the station and also a train&apos;of  sevenwaggons, and that he killed forty Turks.   Details will  followlater.  On March  16 and 17 some 45  culverts and many railswere   wrecked  just south  of el-Ala by  one of Feisal&apos;s detach -ments  which  also burned telegraph  poles.  Colonel  Newcombereports a second  raid  made between  Khishui  Sana   and  Darel-Hamra stations, in  which 110 z-ails and much telegraph wirewere destroyed ;   twenty-one  prisoners  wrere  taken, presumablyfrom  repair-gangs, and a Turk was killed.  No train  from thenorth had passed that point, between  March 24 and the date ofNewcoinbe&apos;s despatch.  But the Turks, if not interfered with,seem able to repair about a kilometre of double track  per diem.covered the 337  miles from Aleppo to Anah in 31 hours.  Heavylorry traffic would no doubt necessitate improvement of  the trackhere and there,  as  well as the strengthening of bridges (e.g. inAnah town), but nothing more serious than could be effected byadvance parties of an army on the march.    As for the routes which  branch off from the Aleppo track atHit and Der  ez-Zor and strike straight  for  Damascus,  they  aredesert tracks  throughout, not provided at any season with  water for more than small  parties.  Without carrying  water  for  thewhole strength,  an  army  could  not venture upon either  routeexcept, possibly,  after spring rains.   No  considerable  modernforce is  known to have  marched by these  ways.   Nor, for  thesame reason,  have they been  used for  carriage traffic,  althoughprobably the surface presents no insuperable difficulty.  A motor-car ran some years ago from  Damascus to the Euphrates, causinggreat excitement and leaving many legends among the  Beduins.The present writer does not know  for certain which track wasselected, but believes the car followed, more or less, the  southernone, which strikes the river near Hit.

Lieutenant Garland has returned to resume his  operations andhas gone inland from Wejh.  The section of the  line fromMedain Salih to Tebuk is reported held  by 600 Turks, who havethree aeroplanes.  At Medain Salih itself  are 300 infantry, of whomtwo-thirds are Syrians. At el-Ala are 500 men, similarly divided between  Turks and Syrians,  as well as  60 camel-corps  and  asmall  cavalry  force.   The whole enemy  composite  force, basedon Tebuk, is about 5,000 strong.    What the precise  situation at Medina may be at the  moment is  obscure.   Intelligence  agents have  reported  more than once that the Turks intend to hold the city itself with a small garrison,after  the bulk of their Expeditionary Force has been withdrawn to el-Ala and north of this point.  Though this report contradictsour statement on  p.  125, it may  possibly be that an  originalplan  of complete  evacuation  has  been   modified  either   byrealization of the difficulty of withdrawal  in face of the  Arabsalong the railway, or by remonstrances  from Fakhri Pasha, whoappears  still to be in  Medina.  The raiding parties sent out byAll and Zeid are operating now quite close up to the city, andthere  is some reason to think  the Turkish defence of Jebel Ohodhas been abandoned and that  Bir el-Mashi  is hard pressed.    The main agent of recent delay has  been Feisal, who hasnot  stirred  from  Wejh  for  two  months.   At  first  he  was occupied in compounding the feuds  of the  north-western tribes ;but though he was formally  successful  in this task, we have hadindications that his influence with both  Billi and Beni Atiyah  isnot yet decisive.   He  has, however, received  considerable rein-forcements of late from tribes still  further  north.  We heard  onMarch 31 that 2.000 camel-riders, with  242 sheikhs,  had come into Wejh from the Ruwalla Amezah,  the Sherarat, the Beni Sakhrand the Huweitat, the Amran sub-tribe  of  the   latter  beingespecially mentioned.   A  further tribal  name,  Tabt,  included with  the above, may  refer to Huweitat from  the  Tabit regionNE. of Maan.   We were informed  further that ninety of thesesheikhs had offered 140 horses and also arms.   A representativeof Nuri Shaalan one  Sheikh  Shawan had also arrived at Wejh,and on April 3 we  heard that 800  more Ruwulla were expectedthat day.  Also a brother of  Nuri is said to be coming  to meetFeisal.  Audah abu Tayyi, of the Huweitat, has been to Wejh.    These accessions of new  tribesmen have raised in an acuteform  the questions of rifles, money, and food supplies ; andthe discussion of  these is  causing further occasion of  delay.Though Feisal despatched inland on April 2  a force, with  twoguns  and  four maxims,  under Sherif Sheraf,  he himself has declined to move till he can make  good his promise of  rifles  tothe Huweitat  and others.   This  question  of rifles is difficult.We had put into the Hejaz,  previous to  the  Wejh expedition,54,000 rifles, and even after deduction of  the first almost  uselesslot of  Japanese arms, 45,000  remain.   A careful  enquiry madeearly   in  February proved  that practically all these could  be accounted  for  satisfactorily ; but that many  remained  in  the
hands of tribesmen, etc., who were in the field  at  the  beginningof the Revolt, but now were  no longer  needed, e.g.,  tribesmenof South  Hejaz.  King  Huseiu has been urged to call  in theirrifles, but to get a tribesman  to part  with  a  European  rifle is hardly  more easy than  to induce him to  draw his  own teeth.Feisal has exercised  a commendably  strict control over issuesfrom reserve  stock  to new tribal elements ;  but  when, afterWejh, these last began to accrue in increasing numbers, he madea  further  demand  for  30,000  rifles  and  15 million  rounds.With some demur, our War Office, on February 21, approved ofthe issue of 30,000 rifles from Egypt, the Sudan and Salonica, so soon as they should be released by the arrival of new arms from england.   These new arms were not  despatched  until  the firstor second  week in  March,  and at least a  month must elapse before the rifles for the Hejaz are  ready.   The C.-iu-C, EgyptForce, in response to  a further urgent demand  from Feisal, verykindly provided an emergency  issue of 3,000 rifles  which havealready arrived at  Wejh ;  and  in  addition  816  have  been secured . from  the Egyptian Army.   While there  are  obvious objections to pouring rifles and ammunition.into Arabia,  and nosupply is likely ever to satisfy the demand,  it is difficult to  cryhalt  so long as the Turks hold on to Medina  and the  railway.To attack  the latter, more and ever more tribes must be enlisted  ;and  as has been said above, it is very hard to  recover rifles onceissued.  When, however, the tide  of war rolls  definitely  north-ward, it is  hoped  that  some  considerable transference of riflesfrom the southern tribes  to the northern may be effected.     The questions of money and  food  supplies are hardly  lessdifficult.   While gold is becoming an ever scarcer commodityand  food has to be husbanded even in Egypt, the  demands,  andto some extent the real needs, of the insurgent Arabs grow fromthe same causes as affect the question of rifles.  A lump sum ofof  100,000, authorized for distribution to  northern tribesmen,is rapidly  being exhausted,  and  a  definite increase  of  the periodical  subsidy  is urgently demanded.    Beduins  are  not readily to be persuaded  that  great European  Powers, who - saythey are winning a war,  have to go short themselves,  and must ask their allies to go short too.     It is  interesting that a 20 h.p. Crossley  tender  has covered the  first seventy-six  miles (out and home)  of  the Wejh-Medinaroad, Avhich was described  by Lieut.  Garland in our No.  45p. 129. It experienced no puncture or accident of any kind, butfound the country from  the seventy-sixth mile on to the R.F.C.advanced  base  at Bir el-Ugla or  Akila (ninty-seven  miles) toorough for progress.   For the first twenty-six miles from Wejh itkept up an average speed  of. 8*3  miles per  hour  ; for the nexttwenty-nine miles  (to  Khautlah)  a  speed  of  14&apos;5 ;  for theremaining eighteen miles, where  the  ground  was littered with large  angular  stones, a speed of  only  6-6 miles.   Nothing hadbeen done  previously to tbe track.   Ford  cars  are  being  sent out for this service.
                           SYRIA.                            books.     I am asked frequently whether any, and if so, what, book in a European language provides a conspectus of the actual social and political conditions of Syria.   I can only reply that, to the  best of my knowledge, there is no such single work.   Guide-books do not supply the need,  both for the general reason that they  treat such subjects too summarily and  for  the  special reason that, in Syria, they  devote a  disproportionate amount  of their space to one small fraction of  the country, viz. Palestine.  Nor are the best geographical compendia much more satisfactory, their sectional treatment of so comparatively  small a territory as  settled Syria being necessarily very brief.  Moreover, there is no modern travel- book, which describes all, or anything like all, Syria.  No govern- ment commission, scientific society, or individual explorer, has ever set to work to examine this  land, as a whole,  and produce a comprehensive  report upon  its  entire  length.   Either,   like Oppenheim, the travellers have taken  cross sections only, or, like Miss  Gertrude  Bell,  one longitudinal  section  with  occasional digressions to right and left.   None has covered half  the whole ground.   This lack reflects  and illustrates the  historical fact that, in practical politics, Syria has never yet been regarded as a single entity,  and the  further  fact  that one  district  of  it,  Palestine, detached from the whole by  sentiment, has  engrossed popular attention.  Therefore one can  recommend no single book on the society and  politics of Syria, regarded as one land from the Negeb to -the Taurus, but  only  several books  on  different  districts. Those of comparatively modern date and general scope alone will be cited  here, and periodical literature, which is not easily acces- sible, and Intelligence Handbooks, etc., which  may  be  taken for granted, will be left out of  account. ;.,    To  begin from  the  south, the desert fringe has been rather unusually well studied and  is sufficiently described in a group of three  good  books, PalmePs &quot;Desert of the  Exodus,&quot; MiisiFs &quot;Arabia Petraja,&quot; and &quot;The  Wilderness of Zin &quot;  (Pal. Expl. Fund), by Woolley and Lawrence..     For Southern Palestine, west of the Dead Sea, we are fortu- nate in having Ellsworth HuntingtoiPs &quot; Palestine and its Trans- formation,&quot;  a recent intensive geographical study  of all ancient Judaea and  Samaria ; but this book will not be found  sufficient by an  enquirer  about ethnographical  distribution or features of social life.   Nor do I know any other recent book that will supply this  defect.   We are better off  in the  wilder region east of the Dead Sea ; for there we have not  only MusiFs book, cited above, but Jaussen&apos;s &quot; Coutumes des Arabes du Pays de Moab,&quot;  and (more illuminating  than either of these) a glimpse of the Belqa country  through the  sympathetic  discerning eyes of Miss  Bell,as set forth in the  opening  chapters  of. her &quot;Desert and the Sown.&quot;  This  traveller comes more fully into the picture as we
proceed north into the Hauran  and  Jebel Druz,  where  Oppen-heim&apos;s &quot; Von Mittelmeer zum Persischen Golf&quot; begins to be useful, and more than one of Schumacher&apos;s  intensive studies ofsmall districts (Schumacher compiled a map of the East Jordanlands for the German Palestine-Society) can be consulted.     Returning to Western Palestine, we find  a wealth of ratherout-of-date books, mostly  in  English and  of pious tendency ;but  the most comprehensive and useful  are  probably  Guerhfs&quot;Description  de la  Palestine&quot; (several  volumes) and  GeorgeAdam Smith&apos;s &quot;Historical  Geography of the Holy Land.&quot;   the statistical volumes of Cuihet cannot be neglected  for any part of Syria; but they are already somewhat out of date.     Great  and constant as has been the public  attention chal-lenged by  the Lebanon region, I  know no good  recent book onits societies.   Two chapters in  Oppenheim&apos;s first  volume, combi-ned  with Gobineau and with Wortabet&apos;s  rather ancient  work on&quot; The Religions of Syria,&quot;  will give  the most necessary informa-tion.  For Damascus  and its oasis, Oppenheim and Miss Bell canbe used after the reader has been grounded in earlier literature,represented by  PortePs &quot; Five Years in  Damascus,&quot; etc ;  andthose same two books, with the Memoirs of the Princeton Expe-dition  (H.  C. Butler), and Lady Anne Blunt&apos;s &quot;Bedouins of theEuphrates,&quot; must serve for the desert fringe  from the  Hauranto the neighbourhood of Aleppo.   But about the  Orontes Valleyand  the hills and coast north  of the Lebanon proper, there  isvery little to read.  Miss Bell takes one to.Homs and Hamah anda little into the western mountains, but even she fails us betweenHamah and Antioch.   Few.European visitors have ever stayedin, and still  fewer have described, the middle Orontes Valley ;and  as for the  Lebanon  and its  continuation  through JebelAnsariyah  to Jebel Musa,  no one ever seems to go to those  hillswith an exploring purpose, or  if  any one does, he publishes norecord.  There are few regions  of Asia less well known than thathundred-mile course of the Orontes from Hamah  to Jisr Hadid,together with  the range which looks down on  the one side toutsvalley, on the other to the sea.     In Antioch  and Aleppo and their neighbourhoods we returnto Miss BelFs illuminating guidance ; but needless to say, she didnot  set herself  to describe any place in Syria in.&apos; the gazetteermanner, which alone would satisfy all our needs.   In the regionremaining  to the north, the district of Islahiyah-Killis-Marash-A dial nan-Ain tab, which used to be called Commagene, two Germanbooks  of   travel are  useful,  viz.  Humann&apos;s  and  PuchstehPs&quot;Reisen in Nord Syrien.&quot;  and Sachau&apos;s &quot; Am Euphrat&quot; ;  butneither is at all comprehensive.   The plain truth of the matter isthat  the greater part of  Syria, north  of the butt-ends of Lebanonand  anti-Lebanon, though  it presents  few difficulties  to enter-prising explorers and has much  to attract them, remains  still&quot;unpublished&quot; in this twentieth centurv.

                         LIBYA.                   The Senussis  and Siwa.     The most recent information of Seyyid Ahmed&apos;s movementsis to the effect that he has left-Jaghbub with  Mohammed  Salih,and so much of  the remnant of his force as was not incapacitatedby sickness or wounds from attempting the journey  westwards.Nuri  appears to  reckon on Seyyid  Ahmed&apos;s support  in  hisattempt to harmonize  the discordant elements in the Benghaziand Syrtis areas, and there are indications that a combination  ofNuri, Baruni, Ramadan Shitewi and Seyyid Ahmed  is aimed atMohammed  Idris, who doubtless  is  losing  ground with  theArabs as long as  the  negotiations  at  Tobruk  continue without-tangible  advantage   resulting  to  him  and  his  following.Mohammed Idris was anxious that  Seyyid Ahmed&apos;s  withdrawal from  Jaghbub should  not be precipitated  by  the fear  that  he(Ahmed) might be driven into Nuri&apos;s arms instead of proceeding in a leisurely manner to a more desirable retreat in  the oasis ofKufra.   There can be no doubt that Seyyid  Ahmed&apos;s cowardice,arrogance  and  vanity afford a fertile ground for  the  seed  of turkish  intrigue,  and  it would  cause  little surprise  to see himranged beside Ramadan  Shitewi (till lately  the  avowed  enemy of the Brotherhood), Baruni and Nuri, though he blames these inmoments of sober  reflection  as the authors of all  the ills  he has suffered.     The town of  Siwa presents a  lamentable spectacle since the Senussi  evacuation.   The dirt is indescribable, but is in  perfectharmony with the squalid and degenerate aspect of the population.Openly all welcome the arrival  of  the  British and their  release from  the oppressor.   Covertly they probably regard our presenceas a choice of evils.  During the visit of the writer the agent  ofMohammed Idris arrived from the&apos;west, and was at once received as  a  person  of  authority.   He   was instructed to withdrawhimself without  delay, an order which apparently came as  some-what  of a surprise to the  leading  inhabitants.  The  town itself was full  of the wives and families of the Western Arabs who had left them  to their own devices in the sauve qui  pent  whichensued on  the reoccupation of the oasis by  us.  There were alsoin the  streets and open spaces numbers  of sick   and   dyingMohafzia lying about, towards whom the inhabitants exhibitedthat  curious  mixture of  indifference  and  kindness  whichMohammedans affect towards their co-religionists in distress.    As far as can be seen at present there  appears no danger  ofa recrudescence of hostilities on our  Western frontier so  long  aswe have  the goodwill of Mohammed Idris,  and he  has the powerto keep the Turkish element in hand.
                          NOTES. Central Arabia.     In continuation of a note on page 158 of our last issue, it cannow be stated, on the authority of a Basra telegram, under dateApril 1,  that  Ibn Saud is now, and probably has been for sometime, established at Bureidah, in Qasiin.  His son, Turki, reported a short time ago to have been sent to raise the Muteir tribesmen,has not been heard of further.  While Ibn Saud does not seem to bepushing  towards Hail, Ibn  Rashid,  who has been joined by theAjman, and  the Tuman and Sinjarah sections of the Shammar,and presumably lias the Abdah  section also  with him, is reportedto be  out  on a  razzia, in the Harb country  west of Qasim ;though in  what strength we do not know.   This  last news con-firms and justifies  the apprehensions of King Husein in regardto his possible action in the direction of  Kheibar. - Saud Subhanis  said to be  out against some part of Ibn Rashid&apos;s people;, butthere is no news of any move on the part of Nuri Shaalan.          *         *         *         *         *     Later news has come from  Basra, under date April 6, sincethe above was in type.  Ibn Saud is still at Bureidah, and keepsIbn Rashid blockaded  at Hail,  ibn Saud&apos;s  brother,  Mohammed,being on the  west  with the Muteir  near  Mustajiddah,  wheresome  Shammar,  abandoned after Ibn  Rashid had suffered  areverse at the hands of the Harb and Huteim, are cut off.  Onthe east is Ibn Saucfs son, Turki.   On the north is Saud Subhan,who has dealt  a blow to the  Abdah  Shammar outposts nearLeinah.  Communications between Hail and Medina  are kept cut.But,  owing  to  help  from the  Ajman. and the  presence  of turkish gunners at Hail, this place is too strong,  at present, forIbn Saud to rush it.Shammar Tribes.     The following information, gathered at Basra from Suweilim,the messenger of Saud Subhan, is sent by Miss  Gertrude Bell,under  date  March  5.   [Is this man,  Masud Ibn  Suweilim,  adescendant of  the original Ibn  Saud,  and also  of  the Riyadhnotable who was instrumental in restoring Emir Feisal to power in 1849  ?  Masud  has often acted as  an envoy  to  Kuweit  onbehalf of the present Emir of Nejd, and if this is  the same man,it is significant  and satisfactory  that he should  now  be  acting with Saud Subhan.]     &quot;As regards  the Abdah,  Ibn  Naheiyir is at  Umm  el(- Radhumah with his  own  section,  the  Wnibar, and  others who have joined  him ;  but Ibn Ajil, when  he  left Ajeimi, went  to the  Emir near  Hail in order to persuade him to move  at once against the  tribes  who  were  collecting under  Saud  es-Salih. The Emir replied  that  he could do nothing  until  Rusheid Ibn Leilah had arrived with provisions and  with orders from  the Ottoman Government.  It is not true that the Emir has  moved
out against Ibn Saud.   Ibn  Leilah  took a full caravan  load,mostly  of rice, from  Nejef.   With  him was a small caravanwhich had  been brought  up  by Nasir  el-Ehashman  (formerconductor  of the Persian  hay through Jebel Shammar).   IbnKhashman had  not  dared  to  enter Nejef but had halted at Aines-Seyyid (5 miles S.W.) and  loaded up from  there.    .&quot; The Sinjarah are at Hazil under Ibn Ilummal.  The Tuman,with .  a  number of Iraqi  Shawiyah,  were near Hazil ; but NuriShaalan, who is at Zaatari,  4 hours W. of Hazil, raided them andthey  retired  towards  Linah.   Fahad  Hadhdhal is in Batn nearSubeikah ; Saud has written urging him to join him, and Fahadhas sent a friendly  reply  saying that he desires  nothing butfriendship  with him.   The friction  between  Pahad and  Nuriarises out of their rival claim  to be considered paramount overall the Anezah.    &quot;Dhari Ibn Tuwalah  has  gone to the Batin.   He has withhim no Aslam but some Suleilai, a section of  the Huteim (from.of  Hail).  The reason of his removal is this.  He had preparedan entertainment for some of the Aslam headmen, among them oneNahdhil.  During  the  course  of it Nahclhil  was murdered  by aman of  the Aslam, for what cause is not known ; but Dhari is currently  accused of  having a  hand in the matter, since it  hap-happened while Nadhil was being  entertained by  him.   Dhari  was afraid to remain lest the Aslam should retaliate ; hence  his hastj&apos;retreat to the Batin.    &quot; The Darb Salman between Linah and Samavah is a blankon the map.  Suweilim says you drink at El-Uqubah, three days from  Linah ; then  at Yahfuf,  a jnbb two  and  half days further on, whence you reach Samawah in three days.    &quot;Jau Khirsan is about eight hours  N.E. of Qaraah Dahisand three days  from Zubeir.   You drink  at Baswah  rather lessthan half waj^.   Bir M oiraqa marked in all the  maps is a mistakefor Bir  Umeighir. &quot;Correction.    The article on &quot; Tribal Fights in the Shamiyah,&quot; published in our No. 43,  p. 87, ought not  to have  been signed wdth theinitials G.L.B.   It was written, we are now informed, by Lieut.R. Marrs, Indian Education Department., now A.P.O., Zubeir.We hereby express regret for our mistake.Asir.    Aden news, from March 10 to 17, reveals  internal trouble inIdrisfs  sphere.   It  appears   that Yahya Ali ibn Thawab, thechief of the Beni Abs, and former general of  Idrisi, is at  oddsboth with Idrisi and with other sheikhs of his  own tribe.   He issaid to-be receiving  assistance  in  men and guns from  the commandant of  Jarb,  the northernmost Turkish  post  in ,the
Yemen Tihamah.   An encounter is reported to have taken placeon February 26, at Khidf el-Butri, which is just- north of  theWadi Ain, in  Abs territory  ; but, according to our information,Idrisi got the  best of it by grace of his newly trained gunners.    Meanwhile  the  Turks  remain   in   Joz  Belair,  leavingQunfudah  practically  deserted.   They  are  reported  to  have carried off the chief sheikhs  of the Beni Yalah from  Yebah andHali to Ebhah, but not to have been strong enough  to raise anytaxes from  the Wadi  Dokah  people.  Sherif In asir  of  Lith iscredited with the intention of returning shortly with  a force fromMecca  to attack Joz Belair.Yemen.    Indications continue  of an unrest in  Yemen which is  be-coming chronic ; it is aggravated by Turkish  nervousness  of anenemy landing near Hodeidah.  The Imam, however, is reportedstill to  be helping the Turks,  e.g.  in  settling the trouble withthe Zaraniq and others in the Zebid district,  who had refused topaj&apos; war contributions.  The old story of the Imam and his  eldestson being at open  variance but in secret accord  has  cropped up again.   If it be true,  the son&apos;is  presumably  acting  against  theTurks.  There is fresh trouble in the Hajariah district, and helphas been sent to Mohammed Nasir Muqbil  from&apos;Lahej.Aden Hinterland.    The  significance of  the  movement  of numerous turkish troops  northward from Lahej, reported by the G-.O.C., Aden, asobserved on March 26, has not been explained further to  us ;  butthe intelligence given in our last issue  (p.  154) and  other indi-cations of trouble on and near the Yemen frontier may very wellaccount for it.  All Saud&apos;s communications have long  been pre-carious and at the  mercy of  the Hajariyah  people.     [A  later communication from Aden makes it practicallycertain that  no movement of Turks is on  foot more important than the despatch  of  detachments  to deal  with local trouble onthe Yusufiyin frontier.]
