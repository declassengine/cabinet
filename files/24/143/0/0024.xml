SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT,  No. XXIV.                                      RUSSIA.     THE Russian offensive as chronicled in the press should be followed carefully, as itis  the safest index of Russian vitality.   The suggestions of  the  would-be Russiandelegates to Great Britain that the inhabitants of Turkey should decide as to the formof Government they desired  is most likely prompted by  pro-Germi n feelings  ratherthan  philosophic  democratic  ideals.  The  proposed  Armenian  force is  a most  usefulsuggestion  and one  which may give real  vitality to  the Russian  operations on theCaucasus front.                                    RUMANIA.     The capital  which the Germans are making out of  the  alleged coldness  of theallies towards Rumania  is interesting.   It is to  be noted  that  Mr.  King, M.P., nevermisses an opportunity of casting aspersions  on Rumania.                                    ABYSSINIA.     In reading the Abyssiniau  news it  should  never be forgotten that  the real centre of Abyssinian troubles is  located in Yemen, where the Turks still  hatch plans  andagents for use across the water.                                     ARABIA.    -Admiral  Wemyss&apos;s  report is of interest.   The  Italians intend to give  us greattrouble on the Asir coast and cannot be prevented  from doing so.  The news of CaptainLawrence&apos;s expedition i.s  most satisfactory.   This  young officer must have  accomplisheda march of about  600 miles at least and has succeeded in establishing touch between ourselves and large elements friendly to ourselves.   The successes which he has broughtabout will probably have far-reaching and valuable results.   The date of his adventuremay be said to mark an epoch in the Arab movement; it will be necessary  now both for ourselves  and  the French to be  ready  to  take advantage  of the situation as  itdevelops.     July  11, 1917.                                                        M.  S.[898-51]

Buchanan telegraphed on the 4th July I No. 1012] thatM. Terestchenko had shown himself somewhat preoccupied by the naval situation; he feared that the Baltic fleet was not in good  fighting condition, owing to machinationsof German agents, and that it woidd probably lose  a few ships  as  German submarineshad (?) in the Gulf of Finland.   He severely criticised the  conduct of the men of the black Sea fleet when the &quot;Breslau&quot; made her  reappearance in that sea.  The PrimeMinister,  with whom he had also had a conversation, had spoken hopefully of both theinternal and  the industrial situation.   He said  that the Government meant to strikewhile the iron was hot, and put down the anarchists with  firm hand.   The  industrial situation, he said, was not  much worse than it was at the end of 1915, and he believedit would again gradually recover.  He attached  much importance to the improvementlikely to be effected  in transport by the rolling stock promised  by the American  Corn-mission.  The Petrograd Sovyet (Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers1. Deputies) had passed a resolution approving the declaration of the army issued by the AU-Russian Conference ofCouncils  of  Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies  by 472 votes  against 271,^ with 39absentees, and had declared that Petrograd would support the army in its offensive.     On the following clay he telegraphed again [No. 1029]  that he had  been informed by M. Terestchenko  that  M.  Kerensky had telegraphed begging him  to  furnish him with material showing that in ordering  the offensive  the Russian Government wasnot abandoning the democratic principles it had  proclaimed in respect of the aims of thewar, thereby helping him  to  counteract the agitation of extremists in the army.  Inreply, M.  Terestchenko was informing him as to  the approaching meeting of  the  paris conference, a proof  of the solidarity existing  between the allies.   Sir G. Buchananhimself thought that nothing would at  the present moment help M. Kerensky so muchas the announcement that the allied Governments  had accepted the Russian proposalfor a conference early in September.     Delegates of the Sovyet for England. Sir E. Howard telegraphed from Stockholmon the 9th July [No.  2098] that his Russian colleague hoped that (in view of the fact       [898-51]                                                          B
that it would have a good effect on the Soyyet) Messrs. Roussanoff and Ehrlicb, Russiandelegates from  the  Committee of the Sovyet to British: Socialist  parties,  who  were-anxious to proceed to London next.week, might be allowed to leave by official boat andto receive landing facilities.  They considered that occupied parts of the Turkish empire should be allowed to decide their own fate, and  one of  their principal objects was to induce the British  Socialist  parties  to adopt the policy of non-annexation, particularly as regards  Mesopotamia and Syria,  Rnssia  having abandoned her claim on Constan-tinople.  Sir E. Howard added that two other delegates of above Committee also wishedto proceed to the United Kingdom, Messrs. Golclenberg and Smirnoff.     Suggested  Armenian Force  [see Eastern Report XXII, p. 2]. Sir G. Buchanantelegrapbed on the  5th  July [No. 1026] that a copy of the project for the formation ofan Armenian force,  drawn up by an Armenian volunteer,  General Andronik, had beengiven to the assistant military  attache, who  had  seen the American  mission  and theFrench Colonel Chardigny, who was attached to Caucasus front.   During the discussion which  took place, the main points, were :  (1) That the force should consist of TurkishArmenians only.  (2) That this force should be used against Mosul, co-operating withGeneral  Maude&apos;s force, and that it, and also the Russian forces operating in thisdirection, should be placed directly under that generafs command.     Financial. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 5th July  [No. 1030] that he andMr. Henderson had discussed the financial situation with the Minister of Finance, andit  was  agreed that the Minister should prepare a detailed statement for Mr. Henderson,on his return  to London,  to submit  to His Majesty&apos;s Government.   The  RussianGovernment, however, being  in urgent need of 25,000,OOOZ. for the month of July, theMinister of Finance  and M. Terestchenko had asked him to telegraph a statement ofaffairs,  which  they hoped  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  would take  into  favourable consideration,  and  place  at  the  disposal  of the  Russian Government the sum of20,000,000 yen, necessary for the most pressing payments in Japan.                                   RUMANIA.     M. Bra,tiano&apos;s Scheme of Reform [see Eastern Report, XXIII, p. 4]. Sir G. Barclaytelegraphed from Jassy  on the 4th July [No. 350] that the chief obstacle in the way ofthese reforms, the difficulty of forming the necessary quorum in the Senate, had been overcome, and  the reforms had been voted by the Senate almost unanimously, the would-be abstainers having finally consented to attend.   M. Take Jonescu promised that he and the other Conservative members of the  Cabinet would resign after the votehad been taken, and so  bring about the Cabinet  crisis which the Conservatives inquestion hoped would lead to the withdrawal at least from the post of  Prime Minister ;this promise induced them to attend.     Financial Assistance.-The Rumanian  Government  having asked for  allied assistance in obtaining a loan of 200,000,000 dollars from the United States, Mr. Balfourtelegraphed to Sir G.  Barclay on the 9th  July [No.  225] saying  that the FrenchGovernment agreed that 25,000,000 dollars should, for some considerable time to come,suffice for Rumanian  requirements;  200,000,000&apos;dollars would go beyond the necessaryrequirements of Rumania for the period of the war, especially in view of the fact thatit  would be impossible to  ship  goods to this  value.  The French Government had instructed  its Minister at Jassy to  concert  with Sir  G.  Barclay in  informing  the rumanian  Government of these decisions, and had also instructed its Ambassador atWashington to inform the Government of the United States.     Discontent in regard to the Allies. Sir  E.  Howard telegraphed  on the 9th July[No. 2094] that the Rumanian Minister at Stockholm had told  him that he  feared thatthere was some truth in  the statement made in a recent  article, entitled &quot; Exclusion ofRumania,&quot;  in  the  &quot; Lokal - Anzeiger&quot;  commenting  on the  alleged  discontent inRumanian  official circles  because of the  indifference shown to Rumania by its allies.The Rumanian Minister had pointed out that no mention had been made of Rumanianaims in recent pronouncements made by the Socialists of the allied nations.  He also:said that an unpleasant  impression  had been made on him by information received tothe  effect  that the French  censor, on  the ground that it was inopportune to publish
 attacks on Austria-Hungary at the present moment, had suppressed an article in a Paris paper strongly criticising the Emperor of Austria and his Government for their attitude towards the nationalities in the Dual Monarchy.  He added that it would be useful for the Rumanian Government to receive some expression of sympathy and encouragement from its Allies at this moment when its army was about once more to take the field.                                   ABYSSINIA.     The Request for Aeroplanes. Mr. Thesiger, telegraphing on the  3rd July [No. 39], said  that Magdala  could not be taken  without  aeroplanes,  as  apparently food was plentiful, but aeroplanes could not be used  before  October.  Moslems firmly believed that Lij  Yasu would come back, and so long as he was at large the country  would not settle down.   The repatriation of Germans would  have a great effect, and Bas Taffari believed that the Council of Ministers would consent to this, if it  were sure that the three Powers would accept the conditions contained in the  telegram of the  2nd July (Eastern Report XXIII, p.  6).  Bas Taffari was anxious to know the views of the Powers.   Mr. Balfour, in answer, telegraphed on the 9th July  [No. 46] saying that a little time was necessary, as the War Office had to be consulted before the discussion of the  proposals with the French and Italian Governments.     The German &quot;Mission.&quot; Sir R. Rodd telegraphed on the  9th  July  [No. 616] that he had been informed by the Secretary-General of the Ministry  of the Colonies that they had learnt that the mission consisted of agents sent by the German Legation at Adis Abeba to stir up trouble  and not of German  officers.   As  toleration  of this would amount to  violation of neutrality, they were of opinion that  the Abyssinian Government  should be pressed to move.                                    ARABIA.     General Situation in Western Arabia. Vice-Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, K.C.B., Commander-in-Chief on the East Indian  and Egypt station, made the  following report on the 13th June :      In continuation  of my letter No.  186/1171 of the 9th February,  1917,  be pleased to lay before the Lords Commissioners. of the Admiralty some further remarks on the state of affairs in Arabia.     2. The  military  situation  in  the Hedjaz  has not altered, though, owing  to our operations in southern Palestine having developed  less favourably than had been hoped, the strain on the enemy  has probably been somewhat  lightened.   Had Gaza fallen to our arms on the 19th April the surrender of  Medina might,  I think,  have been looked for soon afterwards ;  but, heartened probably  by this want of success on our part, and also  by the trend of recent events in Russia,  the enemy commander  at  Medina has evicted all the  civil population from that town, in order,  it  may  be supposed, to prolong his powers of resistance.  Our check at Gaza, however,  is likely to have a more far-reaching result than this should  the situation  not rapidly improve.  So long as the enemy can hold us in our present position in southern Palestine there is nothing, unless it be lack of numbers, to prevent  him reinforcing his troops at  Medina  for the purpose  of   eventually  retaking  Mecca  and  bringing the Shereefian rising to  an untimely end.     3. In such a contingency the whole  question of the occupation  of Rabegh and of landing European troops in the Hedjaz would inevitably crop up once more ;  and I am still  of the same opinion as I was six  months  ago, viz., that the political consequences of any such  action would be such as to render abortive even the results  of any potential military success.  In  fact, the whole  situation  in  Arabia now  pivots on our military operations in Palestine.     4. In my last letter I referred to the  unsatisfactory political situation  obtaining in the Hedjaz owing to the want  of  sympathy on the pait of Colonel Bremond&apos;s mission with the success of the Arab cause, coupled wdth their persistent efforts to obtain small advantages for their own Government. The  result of this course of action had been to make the King somewhat hostile to the  French, and especially to look to us alone  for assistance and support.     5. Sir Mark Sykes visited the Shereef Faisal at Wej on the 2nd May and the  King&apos;at Jedda on the 4th May with the object  of promoting a better understanding betweenthe French and the King, in order to  pave the way for an easier  co-operation between       [898-51]                                                       B 2
 the  French  and  the  Arabs  in  Syria.  I  understand  that  Sir  Mark  reported strongly on the unsatisfactory nature of Colonel Bremond&apos;s  policy, but continued to impress the King and his son with the urgency of being on  good  terms with France. The obstacles in the way were considerable, but before Sir Mark returned to Egypt the King and the Shereef Faisal agreed to discuss the situation with M. George Picot.      6. During my recent cruise in the Pled Sea Sir Mark and M. Picot accompanied me to  Wej and Jedda, when the French commissioner  was introduced to the King and the Shereef Faisal, and long interviews took place on shore, at some of which Sir Mark was present.  At first affairs went far from  well and at  one moment looked  as though conversations would be broken off without any result.  However, as a consequence of a private interview between Sheik Fuad (Secretary for Foreign Affairs to the  King), and Sir Mark Sykes, a further interview was arranged to take place on board my flag-ship, at which M. Picot, Colonel  Wilson, and Sir Mark  Sykes met the King, Shereef Faisal, and Sheik Fuad.  At this interview matters took a decidedly more  favourable turn, and the  King  verbally agreed to  co-operate  with the French in  their  sphere on the understanding that the French policy towards the Arabs should be similar to the British policy in the British sphere.  The situation is therefore now  improved to this extent, that  the King is fairly convinced that there is unity of policy existing between France and England in regard to the  Arab  cause, and is prepared to a great extent to act  on the advice of the two Powers.      7. Hitherto the remarks contained in this series of letters have only  applied  to the Hedjaz, where one definite  policy is being carried out under  Egypt; but in my  letter No. 906/1171 of the.  14th November,  19 J 6, 1  commented upon the difficulties  which arose from the division of Arabia into two political spheres under  tbe guidance of twro such  widely separated departments as India and Egypt.      8. A concrete case has  now arisen which  emphasises these differences and  brings into  prominence the extraordinary nature of the arrangement  whereby  one natural political sphere is arbitrarily divided into two  parts,  each of which is, for no apparent logical reason, in the hands  of a separate Government.     9.  There lately came; to Aden some representatives of the new Yemeni confederation whose object was to ascertain  whether we were willing to assist  them in their policy of deposing  the present Imam  and  of rising  against  the Turks.   This proposal, the natural sequence of the Shereefian rising and according  so well, with the policy pursued by  Egypt in the Pledjaz, met with  the disapproval of the Government of India  on grounds  entirely  unsupported by the Political Resident at Aden.   The matter has, I believe, been satisfactorily settled, inasmuch as the Secretary of State;for India has ruled that the assistance asked for shall, at any rate in some  respects if not all, be given, but the incident forms an excellent illustration of  the  wide divergencies existing between the two different policies being pursued, and  helps to  emphasise the difficulties  which are encountered by all those who have to deal with the Arabian question.     10. The story of. the genesis  of this new  Yemeni confederation is  of the  greatest interest, but a detailed account of it will probably not be required  by their Lordships ; and in any case it does not affect the  main issue of  my remarks, whose object is to point out the delays and confusion which must inevitably arise from two unco-ordinated departments dealing with one subject.     11. Another case which illustrates the different  mentality  of the  Government of India&apos; from that of others with whom I have to deal is the question of the small enemy garrison at Saliff, on the mainland opposite the island of Kamaran, and separated there- from  by some 7,000 yards.     12. I have  more  than  once represented  to the Political  Resident at Aden the desirability from every point of view  of  capturing this garrison, an operation  which could easily be done  with  a  couple  of companies of Indian  troops.  Our garrison at Kamaran is found from that of Aden, and the routine relief of these men would at any time afford  a convenient.and easy opportunity for this operation.   The advantage of such action was more forcibly brought to my mind when on a recent visit I saw for myself how easy would be such an undertaking, and how desirable would be the capture of certain plant for harbour works which is now in  the enemy hands  at  that  place. With the full consent of the  Political Resident at Aden (whose opinion on the subjectcoincides with mine), I telegraphed to the Indian  Government informing them that I proposed to capture this plant,  and that  if they would  allow a company of infantry toco-operate with the ships I could not only take the  plant but also capture tbe garrison.The reply of the Government  of India was to  the  effect that from a political  point of view  they did not like the  proposed enterprise, as  they had no  trouble from Saliff, andthat there would perhaps be a risk of arousing the resentment  of the  local Arabs;  a
view, I may say, which is in distinct contradiction to that held by the Political Residentat Aden as well as the Political Officer at Kamaran.     13.  Under ordinary circumstances I  should  not  trouble  their Lordships  with matters  of such relatively small importance, being of the opinion that they should besettled locally;  but I am  bringing this incident to their notice  merely as  anotherillustration of the difficulties by which I am constantly confronted when having to dealwith those whose ideas on the subject of Arabia are  at such variance.     Red Sea Blockade. Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 29th June[P. 2683] in  regard to  a request made by the Italian  Government that,  pending  asettlement of the general question of blockade, an immediate assurance should be given that a number of sambuks, sufficient to transport 20,000 oxen, should be allowed to plybetween Jaizan and Massowah, the beasts being required for the  early manufacture oftinned meat  for  the Italian army.   This was repeated to Aden, and on the following day the Resident telegraphed [396 A.P.] saying that Jaizan was not a cattle centre andthat he  had  learnt that 20,000 oxen could not  be supplied  from Asir and  Yemencombined, whilst Massowah adjoined the cattle countries of  Somaliland and Abyssinia.His view- was that the Italians were not acting bond fide ; their request was practicallyto run the  blockade, which would become useless.  It seemed to him  that they shouldbe  strenuously opposed;  their action was a political  move, their  aim being to securethe right to unrestricted trade in Yemen and Asir.     On  the  5th July the Viceroy telegraphed in reply  to the first of these  telegrams and with  reference to  the second.   He thought that  the  Italian request should be refused on the ground that if it were conceded  it  might seriously interfere with theblockade arrangements.  But, he said, the Indian Government could not appreciate thepolitical  or military  objection to Italy being allowed  free  intercourse with Idrisi,and even after the war a definite sphere of influence  in that quarter : not being aware,however, of  the  full  issues involved, this view was expressed  with diffidence.  TheViceroy also said that the Indian Government could  not help feeling that the policy ofperpetually riding Italy off Arabia could only lead to friction, present and future, andthis without any compensating  advantage;  moreover,  it might again force  us intomilitary  action, which we should not otherwise take.     On  the  same day Mr.  Chamberlain  telegraphed  to the Viceroy [P. 2702] that,according to the Italian  Government, the authorities at Aden  had, as from the  lothJune, extended the blockade to the coast between  Little Aden and Jaizan. and betweenMokalla and Aden.HEJAZ.     Arab  Success. Sir  R. Wingate  telegraphed to  C.I.G.S. on the  10th  July[A.B. 942] that the Arabs  had  taken  the Turkish  posts  between Akaba, Maan, andTafila, and 400 Abu Tayi tribesmen with Howitat details occupied Akaba.   The turks had lost 700 killed, 600  prisoners, 20  of whom  were officers, and  one mountain  gun.The railway  had been damaged at  many points  and one train  had been mined as farnorth as Ras Baalbek.   Captain Lawrence had come from Akaba  to Cairo by land.YEMEN.     Bombardment of Hodeida. The  Viceroy telegraphed on the 4th July in regard tothe bombardment of this  place by Vice-Admiral Sir  Ptosslyn Wemyss,   The indian government  asked  that the Admiral should be instructed to consult it before under-taking operations of this kind in districts under its political control, and expressed itsdesire to protest  emphatically against the AdmiraFs action on this  occasion, he havingbombarded the place without reference to the  Indian  Government.  Apart from theposition  of English  subjects in  Hodeida,  the Viceroy said that his Government feltserious misgivings as to the effect of the bombardment on the Imam,  who, it knew, was extremely sensitive regarding that place, and not  on the Imam only, but on the wholeAden hinterland.                                     PERSIA.     Relations xoith Great Britain. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 5th  July in regardto Sir C. Marling&apos;s telegram of the 3rd July [Eastern Report XXIII,  p. 4], saying that,while they found it difficult to understand his  views, he appeared  to have completelymisunderstood theirs.   From Sir  G. Mailings  previous  telegrams  the Indian  Govern-:ment gathered that the Persian Cabinet might at any moment be succeeded by a purely
democratic Government or by general  anarchy, whilst there  was much boasting of afresh  Turkish attempt on Persia in local democratic circles.   In its telegram of the25th June last [Eastern Report XXII,  p. 4]  the Indian Government had  suggested a constructive policy to meet the situation.  Sir  C.  Marling apparently failed to realise that anarchy would give an open road southwards for the Turks, turning our Baghdadposition, and also menacing General Maude&apos;s base and communications to such an extent as to seriously  threaten  our hold  on  Mesopotamia.   The Indian  Government was convinced that a reactionary policy might lead to very serious consequences, and thatthe conciliation of really strong democrats and  the helping them to establish a working;Government was the only way to check  anarchy.    On the  7th July Sir C.  Marling  telegraphed saying that there would [?]  be a formidable effort made against  us, or  to assist our enemy,  by any probable  Persian.Cabinet ;  he  said this leaving aside all considerations of what the  Turks could  attemptin that  direction and  of  the military position  in Mesopotamia, matters  in regard towhich he had no knowledge, and  speaking only from  a Persian  standpoint.   he regretted  that the Government  of India should  fail  to  understand his  meaning; it seemed to him that  they agreed, though for different reasons, as to the  policy to  be pursued.  The Indian. Government appeared  to him to think that, as a possible meansof forming a  working  Government  and preventing anarchy, we should  support thedemocrats ; whilst he  wished to remove the only political, capital  of  the party and soto weaken it, that capital  being hostility to foreign, i.e., British, interference.  The onlyobject of the democrats was to acquire power to De used for their personal advantage,whereas the suggestion of the Indian Government implied a desire on their  part tobring about improvement in Persia.   In. the army  the  democrats were very much  whatthe Committee of Union and Progress was in Turkey.     The Russian Minister. Sir C.  Marling telegraphed,  on  the  5th July [No.  231],with  reference to his  telegram,  of the  17th June [Eastern Beport XXI, p. 3], sayingthat the Bussian Minister bad no special instructions.   He said that he thought that itwould be impossible for his Government to exact the  enforcement of  the  Augustconvention, but  it wished  to abide by the 1907  convention.                                      INDIA.     The  Mahsuds. The  Viceroy telegraphed  on  the  4th  July with reference to his telegram  of  the 28th June [Eastern  Beport  XXIII,  p.  5]  saying that  the  indian government, feeling that, without prolonged operations,  a  more favourable settlement was hardly feasible, had authorised negotiations to be begun on the lines of the  Mahsucloffer, viz.  : that  they would  (1)  expel  outlaws ; (2) restore rifles taken since  March ;.(3) release prisoners ; and (4) settle  Dodds&apos;s  murder according to tribal custom, if the.Indian Government  on its part  released its prisoners  and restored allowances.   they undertook to hand over at least 150 rifles with  their prisoners by the 7th July, to provetheir good faith.TRIHTKD AT THE FOREIGN&quot; OFFTCK BY C.
