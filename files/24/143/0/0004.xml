SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT No. IV.                           MAP OF THE MIDDLE EAST.    Attached to this report is a map, specially prepared  for facilitating  the  study of middle-Eastern questions.  There has hitherto been no map produced showing Warsawand Delhi on a single sheet.  The present  map shows  communications only, but, it isproposed to re-issue it occasionally with political, economic, and ethnographic additions,:,                                     RUSSIA.    It is to be noted that  there  has been  no internal political  news from  Russia for two weeks.   Although it is  impossible  to anticipate what may occur, the lull sincethe suppression of Rasputin is all to the good.                                     TURKEY.    The news from Turkey contains  several items of interest:     1. The  accounts of the state of destitution and misery prevailing in Asia Minor           coincide with other information but cannot be regarded  as conclusive.   The           report  that  Enver  had  promised an  early peace  in order  to  calm  the           population confirms  statements  made  by prisoners, taken in the Caucasus           a little while back.    2. The  rumours from  Berne regarding the revival of Abdul Hamid&apos;s  activities           seem unlikely, but suggest an increase of disaffection against  the  Govern-           ment; in Turkey (as in Byzantium) the dead or exiled tyrant grows popular           in moments of crisis.    8. The attention which the Turks are paying to the Shias of Kerbella is of special           interest.  The cumulative evidence of rumour and report goes  to show that           the Turks intend to adopt a new policy towards the Arabs.   The success of           the King of Hejaz and our advance  from El Arish will probably make the           Turks desirous of making their peace with the Syrians and of  reviving  the           old Shia-Sunni quarrel.  The object of -this  policy would  be to promote           dissensions among the irreconcilable and win over the  remainder, and thus           rob the movement of life.                                     ARABIA.                                      Hejaz.    The shortage of rifles complained of by the Sirdar on  p. 4 is a serious matter.   Itwould be most regrettable if, after so many  anxious months, we should fail  to be able totake advantage of our opportunities. -      [898-31]

The speech of the Grand Vizier is interesting.  It is to  be noticed that he revives the fainting spirits of his followers by reference to our  evacuation of Gallipoli. . There is no doubt that this event is one that the Turkish Ministers can  always conjure with so long as they last or the  war.

PART  I.                                   RUMANIA.                                 Food Conditions.     Sir G. Barclay  telegraphed on  the 1.6th February [No.  91] that  a statement prepared by the supply officers of the French military mission had been communicated to him.  The food reserves were insufficient  to  carry on  till the harvest and, unless energetic  measures  were  taken  at  once,  famine  was  imminent,  and  the  first consequences of this would be the evacuation  into Russia of the Rumanian Government and army.  His   French and Italian  colleagues  agreed with  him that  common action should be  taken on  the one hand with the Russian Government and general staff to secure the revictualling of Rumania, and  on the  other  with the Rumanian Government to insist on the evacuation into Russia of useless  mouths, the rationing of the  population, and the  improvement  of railway conditions to provide means of transport.   These measures had been  urgently  demanded by the Russian commander but in  vain, and  the time had come for the exercise of  collective  pressure.   Sir 6. Barclay telegraphed  again  on the  17th February  [No.  92] saying that  he gathered that in the opinion of the French military commission  the impending famine could be averted if the Russians were to retake the northern part of Dobrudja.                 TURKEY  IN  EUROPE  AND  ASIA  MINOR.                               Internal Conditions.     Information has been received from an allied source to the effect that the situation in Turkey  is daily growing worse, particularly in the vilayets of Smyrna, Konia, Sivas, and Angora, which have lost 45 per cent, of  their male  population and 70 per cent, of their labour.  Revolts against the Government are  getting more serious, and are often organised  by  women.   The Government attempt to soothe public opinion by  promises of an early peace.  Nazim  Bey and Platif Bey were sent to  Asia Minor, where they were accused of having sacrificed Turkish blood for the interests of the German infidels, and were stoned by the women.  Enver Pasha is said to  have  calmed the population by promising that all the men would  be sent home  in  the spring of this year.  It is expected that if peace is not made at  once the army and population will revolt.                         Deserters in the Smyrna District.     Information has been received that there were from 6,000 to 7,000 deserters in the mountain districts near Smyrna in the  middle of January.  It  is said that they have retained their rifles, and that there were a certain number of officers among them.                                  Expectations.     Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed from Berne on  the  17th February [No.  137] that he had been informed that all Turks arriving there from Berlin considered that Turkey, at all events, would lose the war. He said, too, that the daughter of the ex-Sultan of Turkey had come to Berne from Berlin with  her  husband, Nabi Bey, and they had given the Turks to understand that  Abdul Hamid was endeavouring  to  spread the idea that thefuture of Turkey -was  in Asia Minor.                           Rifaat Pasha and Rahmi Bey.     An agent reports the recall to Constantinople  of Rifaat Pasha, formerly  turkish ambassador in Paris and  at  one  time Minister for  Foreign Affairs, who had been inSwitzerland practically since the war broke out.   Rahmi Bey, according to the  sameagent,  is also in  Constantinople; he  was appointed  deputy for Smyrna  about threeweeks ago.                                  Propaganda.     An agent reports that, following upon the conference held in Berlin in August last,a Turkish mission was sent to Kerbela, the spiritual centre of the Shiah Mohammedans,in connection with  which two names should be particularly noted S. Hassan, a member
 of the Persian Parliament, and  Aka Abul Kasim, a maulvi  of Kerbela ;  both of these assisted the mission and worked generally for the Turks.  This Turco-Persian combina- tion has the definite intention of reaching India with its propaganda, and the deputation which waited  on the chief authority in. Kerbela was composed almost entirely of men Avho had  lived  in  India, among them being Jafar Bey, formerly Turkish  consul in Bombay.                              Italy and Asia, Minor.   &quot;     Mr. Balfour sent a despatch  [No. 39] to  Sir R. Rodd on  the 12th February, and on the 14th February a telegram [No.  321] summarising the despatch, which contained an account of the  meeting at the Foreign Office on the earlier date to consider the Italian claims.  Mr. Balfour said that, as he had promised at  the first meeting of the Ambas- sadors, he  submitted a map marking for purposes of discussion an Italian  sphere of influence in south-Avest Anatolia equal to the French sphere, but not interfering with it; The suggested sphere,  he said, was roughly the area bounded  on the east by the French sphere, on the south by the Mediterranean, on the wrest by the iEgean, and on the north by a line running  nearly east and  west from Scala Nova through Urgub ; which  area contained some of the richest land in Asia Minor, both agricultural and mineral.     Mr. Balfour had informed those present that as  he could  not acquiesce in this proposal without consultation  with his  colleagues, and those present were  probably similarly circumstaiiced, he only proposed a friendly discussion on that occasion.     The Italian Ambassador at once declared emphatically that  he could not even discuss a plan differing so widely from the territorial  arrangements advocated in  the Italian memorandum of November.   He would only promise  to transmit an account of the proceedings  to Rome, and held out no hope of the scheme being favourably received.     Mr. Balfour added that negotiations were clearly being  hampered by the extreme bitterness felt by Baron Sonnino at the treatment accorded to Italy when negotiations with the Arabs forced the  Allies  to  plan  out  spheres in  Asia Minor.  The Italian Ambassador had hinted to  him privately that the &quot; moral&quot;  damage clone to Italy was so great that  some &quot; material &quot; compensation should be given her; he suspected thatthis meant Smyrna, which would  be unwelcome both in Petrograd and in London.     Mr. Balfour telegraphed  to Sir  R. Rodd  again on the 17th  February, saying that he had learnt that Baron Sonnino had approved the attitude of the Italian Ambassador,and  Sir R. Rodd would gather that this  threatened  to  bring  the negotiations to a deadlock.   The Ambassador indulged in  the  gloomiest prophecies about the fall of Baron  Sonnino and  the break up of the alliance should Italy&apos;s demands not be honoured to the full.  Mr. Balfour said that he saw no object in again summoning the conference ;it seemed to him that the next move lay with the Italians.                             EGYPT AND  SUDAN.                Wireless Telegraphy between El Fasher and Abesher.    In  regard to this proposal  [see Arabian Beport II, p.  4] the Foreign Office tele-graphed to Sir R. Wingate on the-18th February [No. 159]  that the War Office agreedto wireless communication being established between El Fasher  and Dar Tarna andMasalit, but  was opposed  to  an extension to Abesher till requested by the FrenchGovernment as then an advantageous arrangement might be concluded.                           Turkish Mission for Darfur.    Information has been received that in December a Turkish mission to Darfur passed through Gialo (about 90 m. S.W. of Tripoli) en route for Kufra with gifts for the Sultan.Tareg Bey was in charge of the mission :  he was accompanied by Dr. Bechir Fuad.                                  ABYSSINIA.                               Loan of Aeroplanes.    In  regard to  the  loan of aeroplanes  [Eastern  Report III, 3], Mr. Thesiger tele-graphed on the 16th February [No. 12] that he trusted they would come without delay;the effect would be very great.  The aeroplanes were wanted  to capture  Magdala, forwhich purpose bombs were necessary.
                                  The Coronation.    The Foreign Office telegraphed to Mr. Thesiger on  the  14th February, visitors Cairo,telling- him that if he had informed Ras Taffari. about  the  decoration he  must  informthe Abyssinia Government that Major Pearson&apos;s visit had been postponed, and that he,would  subsequently proceed to Adis  Ababa with a  present and  the  insignia of aG.C.M.G.                             French Present of  Arms.    Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir R, Rodd. on the 14th February  [No. 313] that hehad instructed Lord Bertie  to make representations on this subject after consulting hisItalian colleague.                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.                                  The Situation.    The Arab Bureau telegraphed on the  16th February  [A.B. 774] that CaptainLaAvrence had written on the  11th  February that he  believed that the railway was open ; that the Billi were mustering slackly ;  and  that Suleiman Rufada was still hostile,and, according  to  report, had  been  reinforced  by 300 Turks.   The Huweitat wereactively helping Faisal, and  it was  the Shaykh Mohammed Togeiga (previous^ stronglypro-Turk) who had taken  Dhabah  and Muweilah before  the arrival of ships or troops:he was chasing the retreating garrisons.   Some 400 fighting men had  arrived at Wejfrom Ruwalla, Wuld Ali of  Sherarat Maaza,  and  Wuld Suleiman, the last named fromKlieibar ; also oddments from Teima,  Amarat, and Tadmor, and messengers from theShaalans.  The Turks were concentrating at Medain Saleh,  and  they  had a weakbattalion of infantry mounted on mules between  that place and Tebuk : stations werebeing reinforced from Medina,   The  Agheyl from Medina and  those who evacuatedWej have joined King Hussain.    On the same day Sir R. Wingate  telegraphed [A.B. 775] to  G.I.G.S.  that Abdullawas in Wadi Ais awaiting movement  on the  part  of  Faisal, who was held up. at Wejthrough lack of camels, fearing  shortage of supplies  if he  attacked the railway Avith his present transport.   There was no further  news of Aii&apos;s army S.  and  S.W. of Medina,And on 17th February he telegraphed [A.B. 780]  that aeroplanes had bombed the Sathel Ghayir region in Avliich the Turkish camp is situated.    On the 18th February Sir  R. Wingate  telegraphed again [A.B. 785] saying thaton the 17th February Faisal bad sent a message  to King  Hussain informing him thata Turkish advance was threatened  from. Medain Saleh  and Elula, and that a party hadbeen sent to meet the enemy.    Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 17th February [A.B. 782] saying that,  in theabsence of rifles, Avhich he had  asked for, he  feared the Arabs&apos; present campaign Avouldbreak down, and that the destruction  of  the railway  (and consequent isolation  of theTurkish forces in Hejaz) Avould  be posponed indefinitely.  Unless arms and ammunitionin sufficient numbers were forthcoming tribesmen would not move.  For this  failurewe  should inevitably incur a measure of responsibility in  the eyes of King Hussain andhis  military leaders.  As regard mountain guns, the Arabs had repeatedly begged that two batteries  of new guns should  be  given to them.    They attached  probably exaggerated-gerat,ed importance to, the possession of mountain guns  of the  latest type which wouldnot be  outranged  by Turkish artillery.   The Arabs  had now a certain number of trained gunners, and the knowledge that their armament could meet the Turks on levelterms would be a A^ery considerable asset.   Could  we obtain guns from Allies or neutralpowers, if none were  aA^available  in  England ?   Whenever the rifles now asked for bySir  R. Wingate.. were available  he would, notify the King; this  number would be thelimit up to which we could supply, but present Arab offensive would be very materiallyaffected; unless we  could inform the King that these rifles would, be issued in certaincircumstances.                         A Dutch Representative at Jeddah.    In  a despatch [No.  18] dated the 28th January, Sir R. Wingate transmitted amemorandum dealing Avith the irregular position  in Jeddah of a Dr.  Rinkes, who wentthere in connexion with the  repatriation of Dutch pilgrims, and  is staying on for thbenefit of his health (!). till such time as a Dutch consul may be appointed.  He residesin the Dutch consulate, flies the  Dutch  flag, and has been officially received by theKing;  he is de facto  Dutch consul.   Private information has  been receiA^ecl that
             &quot;,;:&apos;:::,Y            .            : o    ,          . .   - &apos;              - - Mecca cadi with  Turkish  proclivities wrote  him  a letter  containing  serious  anti- Sherifian propaganda, which letter was intercepted.   Mr. Balfour has asked Sir Walter Townley, at The Hague, to  inquire into Dr. Binkes&apos; antecedents.                               French Moslem Doctors.      Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 15th February, informing him of King Hussain&apos;s request for French doctors.   He said that he was urging the Foreign Office to oppose the supply of French doctors, but if it were allowed it would be necessary that others from India and  Egypt should be engaged ; he  asked if the Viceroy could supply some.                                                                    .      Sir R. Wingate telegraphed  on  the 14th February [No.  155]  that he  did not anticipate any difficulty in providing the requisite Moslem medical personnel.                          The French Hostel for Pilgrims.      Mr. Chamberlain also informed the Viceroy as to the purchase  by the French Government of a building for pilgrims,  and said that  if the purchase were maintained. it would be necessary for the Viceroy to take similar steps.                         The Proclamation of Independence.     The Caucasus military agent telegraphed on the 15th February [T.L. 770] that the Russian Intelligence Staff wanted a copy of the original proclamation of indejaendance for reproduction and distribution among Turks and Arabs.   They would like  to have, if possible,  several  copies with the Sherifs signature  or  seal, or  facsimile of  the original. ASIR.                             The Agreement ivith Idrisi.     The Viceroy telegraphed  on the 17th February that the Indian  Government proposed to approve the supplementary agreement  concluded by  Colonel Jacob with Idrisi, a copy  of which is issued  with this report.    The Viceroy said that, though it was not  altogether satisfactory, either in substance or in form, in the particular circumstances it  was doubtless the best that- could be  secured, and adequately  met the case.                             King Hussain and Idrisi.     Sir R.  Wingate telegraphed  to Aden on the 16th February, suggesting  that  the present was  an  opportune moment for seeking the basis of a working  agreement between King Hussain  and  Idrisi.   He proposed that  Said  Mustaffa-al-Idrisi,  then in Cairo, should be asked  to pay an informal visit to Mecca, to interview the King, and then, if possible, to go on to idrisi  with a representative of the King&apos;s.   If Idrisi&apos;s consent were obtained, Sir R. Wingate thought that  Mustaffa would do this;  he therefore asked  the Resident at Aden,  should  he favour the  project, to approach Idrisi and telegraph  his consent or  refusal.   In  reply  to this,  the  Resident at  Aden telegraphed  on  the 17th  February  that  he  was  quite in favour of the proposal, and, as  soon as possible, he would communicate with Idrisi, who, he said, was still in a very difficult frame  of mind, consequent on the Comfida and Farsan  incidents.                                     ,                                      SYRIA.                               Distress in Palestine.    The editor of the Cairo  paper &quot; Al-Kawkab&quot; said in  the issue of the 30th  Januarythat he had  learnt  from a  reliable source that distress was, very great in Palestine, and that,  as the Government had requisitioned all available  stocks of  wheat, there was afamine throughout the country, a pound of wheat costing about two shillings.  The Arabofficials had all been removed from their posts, the people were terrorised and peree-cuted, and  prominent natives, both  Christian  and  Moslem, had been imprisoned ordeported.      [898-31]                                                           C
PERSIA.                                     Finance.     Sir 0. Marling telegraphed on the  1.4th February  [No.  59] that he had beeninformed by the Russian  Minister  that  his Government  also considered the  Persianproposal of reform as totally inadmissible.  He and bis  Persian  colleague,  however,agreed  that  it  would  be inexpedient  to  insist on  the  creation of  the  financialcommission at present,  as such action  might  bring about the fall of  the Cabinet.Mr.  Balfour telegraphed on the  20th February [No. 59] that he concurred in this view.                                 Military Situation.     The Foreign Office telegraphed  to  Sir C. Marling on the 16th  February [No. 57]that the War  Cabinet was not satisfied that  a case had  been made out  either forunifying all the forces  in Persia  under one general officer, or that such an officer was required by the local situation at Shiraz.  An officer of field rank, experienced in tribalwarfare, should be attached to Sir Percy Sykes as adviser, and if  to him, in practice,the  latter delegated military  operations and executive command in  the field, thatwould suffice.                               The Disquiet in Fars.     Sir 0. Marling telegraphed on the 15th February [No. 61] that the British  consulat Shiraz had  reported  the return  to Kazerun of the hostile forces ; that one or twoposts between Zinian  and Dashtarjin were occupied  by the South  Persian Rifles ; andthat  the Kawam bad sent  in twenty-two Arab prisoners.   The town was  quiet, and sowere the i-oads, except, that to  Bushire.  Prices had dropped considerably, but therewere still  about  twenty deaths from  starvation daily.   Sir C. Marling telegraphedagain on the  15th  February [No. 64] that the consul at Shiraz had  reported thatSoulet  had offered to suppress the rebellion  of the khans  on  the Bushire  road  on condition that the Governor-General should send his nephew with him as Deputy-Governor of Kazerun, and that  we should pay the expenses of  the force, and provideguns,  ammunition, &amp;c.  The consul advised  negotiations,  but of course  refusal of guns.   The comments of the acting  consul-general at Bushire confirmed Sir Charles inthe opinion that we could not [group undecypherable] much on Soulet&apos;s offer.   The onlyefficient mode of dealing  with  these  khans was to  employ  our own  forces,  but thecolumn which  would  be available  at  Shiraz  about  the middle of March  would  be inadequate;  so  it  appeared  to him  (Sir C.  Marling)  expedient to  authorise  the consul at Shiraz to negotiate within the approximate financial limits he had suggested(30,000 tomans a month  for three months),  unless the  Government  of India was prepared to reconsider- its decision  not to increase  our military responsibilities in theinterior.                          Alternate Trade Route to Shiraz.     Sir C. Marling telegraphed  on the  15th February [No.  6,6] that  the route fromBunda Abbas via, Lar  was  considered feasible  by the consul at  Shiraz, provided that security could be ensured, this depending on the Kawanfs authority over the Arab tribes.The acting consul-general at Bushire concurred, but  with the additional  proviso thatthe Bushire-Shiraz road should  be totally closed, so  as to prevent illicit competition with  trade by the  new route.  The acting consul-general observed, in regard  to thepolitical aspect of the proposal, that the rebel khans expected  that  we  should takeforcible measures against them ;  if this were not done, but the trade transferred instead,they would assume that  we were afraid.   He was inclined  to concur in the opinion ofthe governors of  the ports that  adequate punishment of one of the rebel khans  would settle the  road question.  Sir C. Marling  added that  he  thought  the  experiment of opening [? this] new road was not worth trying.                         INDIA AND  AFGHANISTAN.INDIA.                            Officers for King This sain.     In consequence of a communication made by the Viceroy, the C.I.G.S. telegraphedto Sir R. Wingate  on the 6th  February saying that it was proposed to send a smallparty  of  native officers  and men of  the Indian  army to King  Hussain,  as it was
thought they would  be helpful, especially for machine-gun training.  Sir R. Wingatereplied on the 14th  that King Hussain gratefully  accepted the  offer: they  were urgently needed  and  would prove  most useful.   Sir R.  Wingate recommended  sixofficers who were known to Captain  Bray.AFGHANISTAN.                            The Viceroy and the Amir.     The Viceroy  telegraphed  on the 6th February  that on the 4th the British agentdelivered a letter from him  to  the  Amir.  The latter expressed  his satisfaction,  andenlarged on the  difficulties  he was  contending against  : he  laid special stress on his services in maintaining peace, adding that he left it to his friends [the British Govern-ment] to appreciate those services and to value  his determined policy of  neutrality at its proper worth.

HisMajesty&apos;s Government regarded this as in the  highest degree unfriendly; this shouldbe represented  in the strongest way  to the Siamese Government, which should be askedto instruct its Minister not to persist in his demand.PART  II.THE PBESS.TALAAT&apos;S FIRST SPEECH AS GRAND VIZIER.                              Policy of Neio Cabinet.    Amsterdam,  February  16. A  telegram  from  Constantinople  reports  that astatement read to the Chamber by Talaat Pasha, the new Grand  Vizier, setting  forth the policy of the new Turkish Cabinet, contained the following passage :          &quot; Our country,  which has  always been  exposed to internal difficulties, has    found itself compelled to make sacrifices such as our past has  never  previously    known.   Our  enemies  have declared their  intention of thrusting us back into    the depths of Asia Minor, turning us out  of Constantinople, and driving us from    the Straits.  To these  ridiculous threats of our enemies, who took flight at the    Dardanelles as a result of the defeat inflicted upon them by our  valiant army,    we reply that we  shall not relinquish  Constantinople as long as there is a single    Ottoman left.   (Loud  cheers.)   We  shall persevere in  this gigantic struggle in    close fraternity of  arms with  our brave  and victorious Allies until  we  have    compelled our enemies to recognise our right to existence.  That  is our aim.&quot;    Talaat Pasha  then  proceeded  to speak of the necessity for  internal reform andreorganisation, but  he added :          &quot; In  this great crisis it is quite impossible to undertake important reforms, as    all the nation&apos;s effort must be  concentrated  for  the moment upon dealing with    the internal difficulties  created by  the  Avar.  EA^ery step  with a view to the    establishment  of important industrial enterprises emanating  from  the  capitalists    and manufacturers of allied and neutral countries will be  favourably Avelcomed.&quot;    At the conclusion of the  Grand Vizier&apos;s  statement the  Government was given a unanimous vote of confidence.

From Major-General J. M. Stewart, C.B., Political Resident, Aden, to the     Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Delhi.    C. 59.                                          Aden Residency,Sir,                                               26th January 1917.      I have the honour to submit the supplementary agreement (in originalwith translation)  concluded with the  Idrisi.   I  also forward  herewith amemorandum on this agreement winch has been drawn up at my request.byLieu tenant-Colonel 11. F. Jacob.   2. I  trust that,  the  agreement will meet with the  approval,  of  HisExcellency the Viceroy and His Majesty&apos;s Government.   The main object ofthe agreement, as set forth in paragraph III., has  been secured, and without making further concessions than,  as brought out  in the memorandum, thesituation required.   3. It must be recollected that the Idrisi. is now  in a very difficult, frame of mind.   The Kunfida affair  still rankles deep ;  the rapidity of  our action.in Farasan  is to him  uncalled for and unintelligible, and  our comparativeinaction in Arabia is misunderstood.   Fixed, too, is his conviction that whenpeace is concluded the  old friendship of England and Turkey will secure forthe latter very favourable terms, and  allow her  to concentrate  her power against her present Arab enemies.   4. Extreme patience, ready appreciation, and great  knowledge of  theArab were  required in effecting this  agreement.   All were fully displayedby Lieutenant-Colonel Jacob, and I am glad  to have  this opportunity of bringing his services to notice.                                I have, &amp;c,                                     J. M.

   IT.  His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that  the Farasan.  Islands havebeen captured by the Idrisi Saiyid from the hands of  the  Turks, and have become  part  and  parcel of  the Idrisi&apos;s domains,  in  all  of which  hisindependence  is assured.   III. The Idrisi Saiyid  engages not to cede, mortgage, or surrender these islands nor  the  places  situate on his sea-board,  including the interestsconnected  therewith, to  any  Foreign Power,  and further to call  on.  HisMajesty&apos;s Government for assistance if  these places or the interests thereinare assailed or threatened from without.   IV. His Majesty&apos;s Government undertake to protect these islands  andthe Idrisi sea-board from  all hostile action, without any interference on their part with his affairs and independence ; and again,&quot;in return for his engage-nient to preclude the intervention of any Foreign Power in his territory or with its  interests, His Majesty&apos;s Government engage to afford  the  IdrisiSaiyid the requisite help qua the sinews of war such as arms and ammunition and  the like, both now during the duration of this General War  and  after-wards ; and to facilitate the&apos;necessary avenues to the acquisition by him ofsuch benefits as regards a telephone system and various developments  suchas the prospecting for  mines and the  extension  of commerce and similarbenefits;  and, further, will  vouchsafe his  convenience  and that of his followers in the choice of  a secure asylum in the event  of a crisis  arising inhis country, Avhich God forbid together with  such support of  government as shall assure his dignity and well-being, and shall  use every  endeavour to restore him to his former condition without any diminution therein.   V.  The Idrisi Saiyid engages to keep a  body of  his  armed retainers inthe Farasan Islands as a token of  his independence and  to maintain hiseffective occupation therein.   VI. The Idrisi flag shall fly permanently over the Farasan  Islands and inhis other territories  as  a  sufficient sign-visual of itself  to  all ships of hisoccupation and this without any other ancillary token.   VII.  The rights and duties of  the Idrisi Saiyid herein detailed shall beextended to include his family, kinsmen, heirs and successors.   VIII. This agreement  is signed by. the Idrisi Saiyid on the one hand,  andon the other  by Lieutenant-Colonel H. F. Jacob, the  representative of  the resident, Aden, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government and  shall be  heldbinding on both parties.       Dated Jizan 22nd January  1917, A.D.,  corresponding to 28th Rabi al         Awwal 1335 A.H.                            True translation.                                 (Signed)     11. F. JACOB,                                             Li e u t lieutenant- C ol onel,                                        First Assistant Resident, Aden.MEMORANDUM   ON   THE   SUPPLEMENTARY   ENGAGEMENT     CONCLUDED WITH  THE  IDRISI SAIYID  ON  22ND JANUARY     1917.   In  this engagement with the Idrisi it may appear at first sight that wehave given more  than the occasion  demanded.  The truth is that the Idrisirefused point blank to admit the really essential  paragraph III. without hiscounter-proposals being added.   It is necessary to understand his attitude.    The Idrisi does not know how the war will end.   Last  year he was  certain the Allies would win.   He is less hopeful now.   Then, he feared we might  patch  up a peace which left the Turks &quot; in situ  &quot; as his implacable foes :  to-day, he looks round and sees
                                                            -76them very much  to  the fore in Arabia  and holding their own. &quot;He&apos; citesLahej, Kunfida and  the failure there ;  the&apos; slow progress of  the  Sherif  ofMecca, and finally Mesopotamia, and he doubts our ability to dislodge them.   His fears to-day are two-fold.  Pie believes that       (1) his refusal to treat with any other  Power, and  his promise not  to           dispose of Farasan Islands  and rights  therein, will draw upon           him Turkish animosity.  The Turks up  to  now  have, watched           his coquetry with us but believe they can win him back to the           fold  hereafter.   Let them  once come to know  of  his closer           &quot;nexus&quot; with us  as regards the Islands and they will  regard           him  as completely  ostracised.   There is no arguing  with a           fanatic of such preconceived notions ;      (2)  this  engagement will deprive him of future assistance in arms  and           ammunition from  Djibouti and Massowa, both  of which places           have  for  many  years  very  considerably  assisted   in the arms           traffic.Cut  off  from these two sources of supply to whom, he asks, should he apply for the necessary sinews  of war, and whom should he  approach hereafterexcept the British Government?  The Government must therefore take theplace of these two Powers.    The sole Power the Idrisi fears  now, and after  the war, is Turkey aided by Germany,  and the reason given for securing not only our promise  ofassistance in  arms,  but of advice in the development  of  his country,  anasylum should a crisis  in  the  country compel his temporary withdrawal coupled with the assurance  of a continuation of  these terms after the war to himself and  successors-is  this  one  inordinate fear   of  a  prospectivelyirate Turkey.   From this obsession he could not be  dissuaded.  At first itwas our flag that would incense the Turks, and on the second visit it wouldbe the engagement to refrain from a cession of the Islands that was boundto arouse Turkish resentment.    At one time in the proceedings  the Idrisi had insisted on the despatch ofBritish troops inland, if he were attacked by the Turks,  but I reminded him that our  earlier treaty was  confined to  his sea-board and  to protection  by sea  power.    1 may say that although this engagement in its inception was peculiar tothe  Farasan Islands, yet the Idrisi  was loud, in predicting for the whole ofhis  territories the ill-forebodings he had conjured tip as. the  likely result ofhis  agreeing  to  paragraph III.  It  was therefore not  possible given thedesideratum of securing his  adhesion  to this  paragraph-to exclude  fromthe  agreement this extended area of  his  entire sea-board.   His  Minister(Ba Sahi) declared (and we cannot refute  it) that the Farasan Islands were          . Date of first treatv.           tllei ld*&apos;lsi &apos;S ^io^ the 30th April 1915,1                                    and that, though not specifically nien-tioned, the  Farasan  became at  once a part and  j)arcel of his sea-board and within the purview of that  treaty.     One  result of the present agreement  will  be the  exclusion of Italianinfluence in  the  Idrisi&apos;.s domains.  His Minister told me that the  Italians were very desirous of concluding some agreement with the Idrisi to secure a quid pro  quo  of their long  established  connection  qua  the arms  trade, and that even now the Italians  sent  him ammunition.   At  the &quot;same, time the Idrisi scouted the idea of dealing with any Power save Great Britain, and to our Government he  looked  for every form of assistance.     As  regards raragraph  Y. I found it  impolitic to  insist on. any  fixed number of  his retainers on the Island.  I had  insisted on  &quot; a number  not less than one hundred men,&quot; but this was met  by the  argument that many more might be required and the exact  number  had  best be left to time and circumstance,   The Minister  who  was deputed  on board,   said  that  the Farasan  Islanders were a very stout body of men who  would give a good account of  themselves if necessary.  1 waived the point  of numbers for 1. was dealing with,  a peculiar  cast  of man, and was guided  also by the principle that especially  with Asiatics, is  it unwise to  insist  on  what one cannot enforce  nor  supervise without causing friction.   It is  enough that he  has engaged to ensure hi,s &quot; effective occupation.&quot;\
   At our first meeting the Idrisi  could not understand whose interventionwe feared.   It could not be an enemy, for we surely had control of  the red sea outlets.   As for allies, were they not  our friends ?  If they interfered: or if we would anticipate  such a contretemps we  should tell them,  that the islands were Idrisi, seized by him from the  enemy, manned by him, and hisflag hoisted, to show his  occupation, and, finally, that he was  under Britishprotection.   Such announcement seems to me very essential.  1 am not  aware of any future cut-and-dried division  of the several interests in the Red Sea,  but ithad occurred to me that to hoist our flag and to land our troops  would savourof British occupation and place these islands ipso facto within the category of matters to be adjusted  after the war.   We are already assisting the Idrisi  with  the sinews of  war,  and  the onlyfoe after  the war against whom he asks protection is the Turk if  the  latter is left in the &apos;Asir province.   The necessity for such protection after peace is concluded is very problematical, if at all possible.   The Idrisi would not  sign the  English  copy.  It  was unreasonable, hesaid, to sign what  you  cannot understand.  He however retained both Arabicand English copies.  I did not press him to comply.  His case is a  peculiarone.   The  agreement was concluded  and. signed, after much cross reference,on the evening of  the 22nd instant, and  H.M.S.  Minto was  asked  by wireless  telegraphy on 23rd idem to remove troops  and flag, which he  didthat same day.   I  would   thank Commander  G.  Arnot,   R.N.R.,  H.M.S. Perth, and lieutenant L. P. Nalder, R.N7V.R., the Political Officer of the Southern red sea Patrol, for  their cordial co-operation  in dealing with the fclrisi.  He isthe most suspicious and  the  most  exclusive individual of his class 1 haveever encountered in Arabian politics.  A give-and-take policy was indicated,as he himself was  only too ready to remind me.                        (Signed)      H. F. TACOB, Lieutenant-Colonel,     H.M.S. Perth,                        First Assistant Resident.  Aden.   21th January 1917.
