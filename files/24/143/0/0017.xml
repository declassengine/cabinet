SECRET.    APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT, No. XVII.                                      RUSSIA.     THE new Coalition Government,  the constitution of which  was outlined in lastweek&apos;s  appreciation,  offers us  the  last hope  of saving the military situation on theRussian front this summer.  If this new Government fails nothing short of anarchyand disintegration can follow.   The workmen&apos;s Council remains the all-important factor,not only in Petrograd but also in all the main towns of Russia, and  the inclusion of someof the  responsible leaders  of this Council in the Government  is at least a step in thedirection of combining power and responsibility in the same hands.     M. Kerensky&apos;s evident  determination to  restore discipline and fighfing power tothe  army is the most satisfactory news received since the outbreak of the revolution.Should  he prove strong enough to carry out his expressed intentions he may yet saveRussia and the Eastern Front.     Foreign policy and the land  question are the two great stumbling-blocks in the path of the  new Government.  Skilfully directed and carefully worded propaganda may help us enormously in connection with the former, and it should be possible to appealwith force to the hearts of the workmen and soldiers to modify the extreme &quot; inter-national &quot; policy of  &quot; no annexations&quot; in  regard to  the liberation  of  the subjectpeoples  of the Turkish Empire,  who have suffered and are suffering still from Germano-Turanian brutalities and tyranny.     The land problem, affecting as  it does the chief personal interests of the soldiers atthe front and the great mass of the Russian people, is the most dimcult^question raisedby the  revolution.  An All-Russia  Peasant  Congress  has been  sitting in Petrograd,and  its  demands are that all land shall  be shared  among  those that work it, and thatno family shall have more land  than it can work itself.  There  are already reports thatthe  landowners,  feeling that  they may soon  be dispossessed  of their  lands,  haveneglected sowings, and trying to  realise as  much as they can by cutting down theirforests.   The former course may result in a very serious menace of famine.     It would seem that if  such attempts are  to be made to alter during  the war thewhole structure of Russian local, social, and economic life new causes of  danger anddiscontent will be inevitably aroused.   Already the cry from the  armies that they arepeasants first and soldiers  afterwards is reported, and under  such circumstances therestoration of army discipline will be difficult.   Still the reports  of M. Kerensky&apos;s orders,of General  Alexieffs conference with  representatives of  the  armies  from  the  whole front, and the  recent war  declarations of the Committee  of Workmen  and Soldiers&apos;Delegates are encouraging and  hopeful, and  it may yet be  possible for Russia to regainsomething of her power in  support  of the allied cause.                                      ARABIA.     There  are  no new developments, either  military  or political,  in the  Hejaz.Sir R.  Wingate&apos;s support  of the proposal to  back the new Arab confederacy in the yemen  against  the present  Imam Yahiya and his  Turkish  supporters  is  welcome.
The  Imam has had two years  in which to make up his mind, and continued sittingon the fence has shown that he  cannot be regarded as a valuable ally to us or to theArab movemeut, either now or in  the future.   In addition, anything we  can do toassist in the restoration of our  somewhat damaged prestige  and pre-eminent interestin South-Western  Arabia  is  most  desirable.    The  neck  of the  British Empireis not  merely the Suex  Canal, but the whole length  from Port  Said  to Aden. IAnything which threatens this  long line of communication from the eastern shores of Ithe  Bed Sea  or the  approaches to that  sea is of vital interest  to our Empire, andwe cannot afford to see another  Power established thereon.     The telegram  dated the 22nd May [No. A.P. 366] from  the Political Resident at aden, given in the Addenda, puts the situation in a nutshell.                                      INDIA.     The recrudescence of trouble in the mountains of the  North-West Frontier istroublesome and vexatious.  The  Mahsuds live almost due east of  Kandahar.  by themselves they cannot be regarded as formidable, but there is always the danger thatunpunished licence may spread the  flame and involve near and  even more  distantneighbours.

The New Government: Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the  17th May [No. 722]saying he  had been informed  by M.  Terestchenko that  the  new Government  was virtually constituted.   He  was  to  take  over  the  Ministry, for Foreign..  Affairs,M.  Kerensky would be Minister  of War and Marine, .M. Shingareff would  becomeMinister of Finance^ while  the Ministers of Justice,  Agriculture,  Supplies, Labour,and  (? Post)s  would be  Socialists, of whom  (? three) were  members of the ExecutiveCommittee.  The Government  was confronted with a gigantic task,  and it affordedthe last hope of rescuing the country from anarchy and the army  from decomposition;All its members, including  the  Socialists,  were bent on  carrying on the  war  andfulfilling Russia&apos;s military obligations  to the Allies.  The  next three or four weekswould show whether their,efforts to this end  would be successful; if they failed, or if the Government broke  down, he could not say what would happen.   He expressed his desire to work in closest co-operation with His Majesty&apos;s Government.     On  the  following  day  Sir G.  Buchanan telegraphed [No.  725] that the newcoalition Cabinet  was constituted as follows :          Presidency Council and Interior : Prince Lvov, Cadet.         War and Marine : Kerensky, Socialist.         Foreign Affairs : Terestchenko, Progressive.         Education : Manuiloff,  Cadet.         Justice : Pereverzev, Socialist.         Agriculture:  Chernov, Socialist.         Supplies : Pieshekonov, Socialist.         Finance : Shingarev, Cadet.         Commerce : Konovaloff, Cadet.         Ways:  Nekrassov,.Cadet.         Posts and Telegraphs :  Tseretelli, Socialist.         Labour  : Skobeleft&apos;,&apos; Socialist.         State Comptroller :  Godnev, Octdbrist.         Holy Synod : Lvov, Octobrist. -         Social Welfare : Shakhovskoi.         Minister in Charge  of Arrangements for the Constituent Assembly :  Grimm.       [898-44]                                                           B
    The Ministers, he said, would not officially assume office until a Government Ukasenotifying  their appointment had been  issued.  The Government was to  meet  that afternoon to settle the  form of this  Ukase and  to  decide  from what body it shouldemanate.  They would also draw up their declaration in its final form.    At an  unofficial meeting  of the Duma deputies,  held under the presidency ofM. - Rodzianko, the following resolution was  passed  after  a  short  speech  by  thePresident, who expressed his conviction, amid loud applause, that all present would unitein supporting the newly formed  Government :          &quot; This meeting  of Duma deputies addresses an urgent appeal to the Provisional    Government at the moment of its  reconstruction  reminding it that the principle of    unconditional staunch loyalty  to  our gallant Allies must remain  as formerly the    basis of its foreign policy in questions of war and peace, because vital  interests and    the honour of Russia were indissolubly connected with such loyalty.&quot;    The Minister  of  War and the Forces. Sir  G.  Buchanan  telegraphed  on the19th May [No. 731] that on the previous  day M. Kerensky  had issued the followingorder :          &quot; Our country is in danger and every man must ward off that danger with all    reason and force in spite of all difficulties,  I will allow  no request for resignation,    from persons  belonging  to the higher commands,  based on a desire to escape    responsibility at this moment; those who have left the ranks of the  army or the    crews of the  fleet (deserters) must  return on the day fixed, 15th May [? 28th May].    Persons infringing&apos; this order will  be liable to all the rigour of the law.  This order    is to be read  to all  companies,  sotnias, and batteries and to detachments  of all    ships.&quot;    M. Terestchenho  on the Neio Government. In his  telegram  No.  729 of the 19thMay Sir G.  Buchanan said that  M. Terestchenko, speaking of the new Government, had said that it constituted Russia&apos;s last  hope of safety, but that it remained  to  be seen whether its new Socialist members would be equal to the responsibilities  of office.  Ifthey proved failures  they would have  to go.   He  had. the greatest confidence inM.  Kerensky,  and believed that as Minister of War  he would work wonders with thearmy.   Sir  G. Buchanan remarked that  in his  speech to  peasant deputies who had come to Petrograd, M. Kerensky had spoken of establishing an iron discipline, and ofpunishing severely all deserters  who diet  not return within next (? few) days ;  but theBritish military  attache had been told at the  Ministry of War that,  by way of punishment, recalcitrant  soldiers would be warned that they would be deprived of their share in the eventual division of land.   M. Terestchenko replied that, on the contrary,they would be  condemned to long terms of penal  servitude.  He also hinted that should the anarchists and hooligans resort to further acts of violence in Petrograd, theywould be shot down.     Conversation then  turned  on the Government declaration, and Sir G. Buchananexpressed the hope that he would not  hurry to approach the Allies on the subject of conditions of peace.  He replied  he had no  intention of doing  so. He wished in  any case to await the arrival of the new diplomatic  Russian emissaries in Paris and London ;  beforespeaking  about  peace conditions  he  would like  to see  the  Russian army act.  Whenthey had taken Lvov, he added, they would have the right to speak in other terms thanthey  could  at present.  M. Terestchenko  seemed confident that in  another  month&apos;s time the situation would show a marked improvement.     M.  Sazonof. Sir G.  Buchanan  telegraphed on  the 19th May  [No.  729] thatM. Sazonof had told him that he had sent in his resignation  as Ambassador in  London.He had spoken about the Asia Minor  agreements in a conversation which he  had had with the Prime  Minister, and he said that he would never consent to press  the BritishGovernment to  renounce  its claims in Mesopotamia, as, were  it to do so, the germans would eventually take its place  there,  and that would be fatal to Russia&apos;s interests.  Onthe other hand, the French and Italian claims were, for military reasons, in his opinion,unrealisable.  Though the Prime Minister had concurred in the above views, he felt thatit would be a mistake for him to go. to London ; if he did so  his mission would  be but of short duration.   The&apos; Prime Minister  told him that  a  Cabinet committee  was  to be appointed  to control and  advise  on  the Governments foreign  policy,  and  that he (M. Sazonof)  might assist them with his advice.   The committee  would consist  of the President of the Council, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of War, and the
Minister of Finance.  He intended, however, to go to the country for the benefit of his health.   He agreed with Sir G. Buchanan in thinking that  M. Shidlowski would be by far the best man to send to London.     M Terestchenko, who had joined them, said that M. Sazonof was such a valuablepolitical asset that he did not wish him  to shipwreck his career in London.   He  had offered  that  post to M. Shidlowski, who  had declined  it  for  reasons  of  health.M. Sazonof said that M. Shidlowski was  so  well  fitted  for the post that he must beasked to reconsider his decision ;  he and the  Minister for Foreign Affairs would bothurge him to accept it.     [The &quot; Morning Post&quot; of  the  23rd May published  a Reuter telegram,  sent fromPetrograd  on  the  22nd  May,  saying  that it had been  definitely  announced thatM. Isvolsky, Russian Ambassador in Paris, would be  the new Ambassador in London.]     Propaganda. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on  the 18th May [No. 727] that theyhad been obliged  to adapt their  propaganda to  the new conditions, owing  to  the exceptional situation created  by the revolution.  The  army, the  workmen, and  thepeasantry,  while they believed implicitly all  the  lies told them  by countless agitatorswho were poisoning their minds against the  Allies and advocating peace  on any terms,were so utterly ignorant that they knew nothing  about  the origin  of the war or  the aims for which we were  fighting.   If allowed to  go on unchecked this campaign ofslander  might  produce  incalculable  and disastrous results.    They  wrere  thereforestudying the best means of getting into direct touch with  the above-mentioned three classes,  whether  by speeches, by  leaflets,  or by  a  small  Russian workmenV paper.They were, as a first step, joining forces with the  French  and the Americans, and asthe  result of a meeting  attended  by M.  Thomas and himself they had formed an allied  Committee for war propaganda.  If, however, any  real  good was to be donethey must be  furnished with ample funds, at any rate for  the  next  two  months.M. Thomas, with  whom  he had  discussed  the question, agreed with him in  thinking that the  matter was  one of such vital  importance to  the Allies  that, even if it ended in failure, an attempt must be made to get  at the mass of the  people, and that theymust not be deterred by any financial consideration.  Mr.  Thorne, one of the  Labourdelegates, had told him &quot;(Sir G. Buchanan) that it was. worth while to spend millions on propaganda work.     He hoped that both the French and the Americans would  participate  equally in expenditure. M. Thomas had contributed 5,000 roubles towards printing and circularisingin the army  a million  copies of a patriotic appeal issued by  the Belgian  Legationdescribing  Germany&apos;s treatment of Belgium.  This appeal had  created such a  profoundsensation,  and  was likely to have  such a  salutary  effect  on the  army, that  he  hadventured to contribute a similar sum.   As it was  difficxdt to  refer home  every item ofexpenditure and time pressed,  he would ask  that a  special credit might be placed attheir disposal for  the next two months on the understanding that they should in no case exceed it, and that they should only expend what should be absolutely necessary.His Majesty&apos;s  Government had always responded  so  generously to  his appeals forassistance in  project)aganda work that he  felt diffidence  in  naming  the sum which he feared  would be necessary, namely,  10,000L  M. Thomas  was,  he  understood, asking for similar credit from  his  Government.  Though  the sum was a large one, it  wasinsignificant in  comparison with what  the Germans were spending there.     On the 21st  May Lord Robert Cecil  telegraphed  in  reply  [No.  1025]  that thenecessary amount had been placed at  the disposal of  Sir G. Buchanan, adding  that, ifhe found it necessary  to carry out  the propaganda work,   a  larger sum  wo\fld be forthcoming.     English  Labour Delegates. Sir G. Buchanan  telegraphed  on the  17th May[No. 716] that  the English Labour delegates had  left on the  16th.  Their report  hadnot been drafted, but would be submitted on their return to London.     Charge against the  late Emperor. Lord Bertie  telegraphed [No. 458] from Parison the 18th May that the &quot;Matin&quot; of that date had published a communication madeto a Russian journalist by Count -Witte, according to which the Emperor  Nicholas  had.concluded  a defensive and offensive alliance with the German  Emperor immediatelyafter the Japanese war.   Count Witte claimed to have rendered  that alliance abortiveby threatening  the German Emperor that, unless it was declared non avenue, he w7ouldrefuse to countersign the treaty of Portsmouth, and  so make it impossible for Germanyto obtain the means  required for its economic policy.   M. Isvolsky intended to  make a       [898-44]                               &apos;                        B 2
communication for publication in the &quot; Matin&quot; to the effect that this was an act not,as had been  suggested, of treachery to France, but  of weakness on the  part  of theEmperor Nicholas,  who  had been persuaded by the German  Emperor that france would join such an alliance against England.                                   TURKEY.     Conditions  of  Life  in  Constantinople. A  letter  dated  the 2nd April from a jewish  source  in Constantinople said that  prices were very high but everythingwas obtainable;  charitable institutions were being  well supported and subscriptionswere much larger than in normal times.   During the winter, tea parties, dances, &amp;c,had  been given much as usual.   A correspondent of an  Ottoman  company said thatDerkos water was only supplied twice a week for  four  hours on each  day.  Later itwas reported from a reliable source that news had come through  from Constantinoplethat owing  to  lack  of coal the Derkos  water supply had  been  cut off and typhusfever had made its appearance in the city.  Also  that  letters dated the 21st Aprilreceived, via  Holland, from Smyrna reported that  it  appeared from communicationsreceived from English people  in Constantinople that living there was  becoming verydifficult indeed and only  the very rich could live with any semblance of comfort wherevictuals were concerned.                                    ARABIA.YEMEN.     Confederacy against the Imam. In  regard to  the  telegram  [A.P.  359] sent bythe Resident at  Aden on the  15th May [Eastern  Report XVI,  p. 7], Mr.  Chamberlaintelegraphed  to  the Viceroy  on the 17th May saying  that, primd facie, he thoughtthat the movement should be supported, and  he was addressing the Foreign Office inthat sense.     A  telegram from  the Viceroy  of  the  same  date crossed  this.   The  indian government, it said, was not able to gauge the prospect of  the confederacy&apos;s success,but as the ejection of the Turks was only a secondary object--the main one being the overthrow of the Imam it thought that it would be well to follow  the traditionalpolicy  of non-interference in  inter-Arab  quarrels.   If  we supported the  confederacyand it failed, we should  bring the Imam  down on  the  Turkish side of the fence and make him a permanent enemy.  After all, the Imam had been strictly neutral whenhe might  have added  to our  embarrassments.  The  Indian Government thought thatthe Resident might reply that he  could  not recommend the Government  to supportthe confederacy  till it had shown that its main objective was  against  the Turks andthat the  plans  were  likely to succeed.   There seemed  to  be  but little or no  fear of italian  intervention, and we could not well leave  the parties to fight it out among themselves and then accept the victor.     This was repeated  to Sir  R.  Wingate, who  on  the following  day  telegraphed[No. 532] that in his opinion there appeared to be a serious risk that the non-committalattitude of the  Indian  Government might  induce  the  confederacy to appeal  to theItalians  for  aid unless  all fear of Italian intervention,  open or secret, had been removed.  If the new confederacy would  undertake to oppose the Turks in Yemen andshould be considered able to fulfil its  undertaking, he suggested that we should assistit with  money and, if required, munitions of war.   Our present policy was, he  said, toinstigate  the Arabs  to right  the  Turks, which  the  Imam had  hitherto shown noeagerness to do.     The  Resident telegraphed to the India Office on the  18th May [No. 360 A.P.],saying that he had consulted Abdullah Sultan, who was in favour of immediate  support to the confederacy.  It was  estimated that  about  25,000 men would be put into thefield :  we should have  to help  with  money and munitions.   He suggested  that a promise of support should be given, and the leaders should be summoned to Aden thata regular agreement might be concluded.                                MESOPOTAMIA.     Relations  with Tribes. [See  Eastern  Report XVI, p.  8.]   The  Arab  Bureautelegraphed from Basra on the  17th May, saying  that the agent of the  Shaykh ofMohammerah at Kazimain,  who was seized and banished  by the Turks, had  arrived from Diarbekr,  having made his  escape from Jabal Sinjar.   He reported that Hammu,
EmiPof the Yazidis, was keen to get into touch with us.   He was sheltering Armenianwomen and children.  The scanty rainfall had obliged the Arab  tribes to gather roundSinjar,  where  they, are  dependent on  the  Yazidis for water and pasture.   ThusHamnnfs position was said to bs unusually strong and. Turkish authority in Sinjar wasnon-existent.    Two  separate messengers had arrived from  Ibn Hadhdhal  bearing cordial letters.He proposed to come in  person to Bagdad, and offered his assistance in communicating with the tribes of the Syrian desert.                                    PERSIA.    Bakhtiari  Levies. -Sir  G.  Marling  telegraphed on  the  15th May  [No. 172]expressing the opinion that with the change in Russia&apos;s  attitude towards the Persianquestion, and  the  improbability that Russian  troops would be used as was formerlypossible, the raison cVetre of the levies seemed  to have disappeared ; that raison aVetrehaving been the prevention of collision &apos; between  Prussian troops and the tribes  by thecreation of a  force which would co-operate with the former  in  keeping  order  on thefrontier.   Leading Khans who  professed  their readiness  to fall in with the  scheme would now proba.bly oppose it.  They were greatly  offended that their  large interestshad been totally disregarded at Shuster and Dizful, where  our military  authorities hadpractically taken  over the local administration&apos;;  and they pretended anxiety that the levy scheme might prove  a preliminary to  similar  interference with the  tribes.  TheIlkhani was consequently  insisting on resigning, and the  only possible successor whowas ready to support the scheme was unsuitable in other respects, and was not approvedby the leading Khans.   So far as  Sir C. Marling w-as aware little or nothing had beendone in the way of recruiting, though the organising officers and material supplied bythe Government of India had just arrived.  Though the levies might be of present utilityfor the policing of the  road and of future advantage as paving the way for the intro-duction of the Southern Persian Rifles, in the  circumstances he was  disposed to think.that the scheme should  be dropped.    On the 20th  May Sir P.  Cox telegraphed from  Baghdad [No. 1751] saying  that he agreed with Sir C. Marling that  the inauguration of the levy scheme should be post-ponecl.  But  he wished to remark incidentally that the allusion to our proceedings atShuster and  Dizfui and to our disregard for  Bakhtiari interests were inaccurate andexaggerated.   There were, he said, &quot;no  military authorities  proportionate to place&quot;;there were political officers  who bad been exercising a salutary  influence over theadministration and evolving out  of chaos  such measures of order and  security  as hadbeen demanded by military interests.    Sir&quot; C. Marling telegraphed  again on  the  18th  May [No.  178] that it appeared tohim, on further consideration, quite impracticable to proceed with the scheme at this moment.  Loyalty to Russia compelled us to take up  an attitude in regard  to the;retention of the Governor of Ispahan which was bitterly resented  by the Khans, who,although they might, when Noel propounded it to  them, have assented to the  scheme on the ground of  the  necessity of averting possible Russian interference,  would nowunquestionably oppose it,  partly out of (? resentment) and  partly because  they would see in it the commencement of British interference in internal tribal affairs.     No Ilkhani, whatever promises he might make  to us in the  hope of getting office,would, without the full approval of the senior  Khans, honestly endeavour to carry out a scheme of this (? kind).    Cabinet Crisis. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the  16th May [No. 175]  that the shah  had been so impressed by the  spontaneous demonstration  of the  Teheranis  infavour of the Prime Minister and by his firmness that he had requested him  to retainoffice ; for the  present, in spite of internal dissension,  the  position  of the Cabinetseemed comparatively safe.  The Shah and his democratic friends were now, partly onaccount of money to be made and partly with a view to influencing elections,  urging anumber of changes in provincial governors in the north.  The Prime Minister  hoped to utilise the opportunity of removing one or two of his  most redoubtable opponents by giving them provincial appointments.   The Shah and  the Bakhtiaris were makinggreat efforts to  remove  Akbar from Ispahan, and as the Cabinet was  aware that thesupport of  the  Russian  Charge  d&apos;Affaires  was  given  without  instructions fromPetrograd, it was possible that it might  give way in  spite of Sir C. Marling&apos;s  advice to stand firm.               .&apos;./..
61          f     Elections Ordered.-Sir&quot;C.  Marling telegraphed on the  20th May [No.. 180] thatall parties in Teheran were showing great activity in consequence of the publication of&quot;an order for new elections.                                     INDIA.     The Mahsuds.-Telegraphing on the  20th May, the  Viceroy  stated that  thesituation had  been carefully reconsidered and  the Indian Government had been forcedto the conclusion that the present policy of passive defence was no longer tenable.  Thesuccess of the hostile sections (which were hopelessly committed)  had  reacted seriouslyon the neutral sections and probably on the Darwesh.Khel Waziris.   Unless the powerto hit back could be demonstrated effectively, there might be a general rising betweenthe  Kurram and Gbnral rivers, with a danger of further extension.   The only hope ofsuppressing the hostile  sections and keeping others from  joining lay  in  successfulreprisals..  The Indian Government would gladly avoid this diversion were it practicable,as it. fully  recognised its larger  commitments to the Empire and  the necessity forfulfilling them.   Bui  it was reluctantly forced  to  face the fact that  the proposedpunitive.measures alone  offered some hope of bringing the  Mahsuds to their senses;passive defence was no longer possible.     On the 23rd May, Mr. Chamberlain, telegrajming to the Viceroy, said in regard tothis ---question that he appreciated the risk of causing  an extension of trouble  by amerely passive defence.   On the other hand;  offensive operations might produce thesame effect, as had been  shown in  1897.   The  Viceroy and his  advisers  werethe  best judges,  and  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  would accept their  view  if  theywere clearly . of opinion  that active  operations  offered ; the. best chance of security.Mr.  Chamberlain asked the Viceroy to let him know: (l)  What communication it was proposed  to make to the Amir,  in  view  of the recent  correspondence  with him ;(2) whether any special measures for  steadying the Afridis were considered necessary ;(3) the terms of peace it was contemplated imposing on the Mahsuds ;  and (4) what was proposed in the event of the operations not having the expected effect.   In regard to(3),  Mr.  Chamberlain also  asked whether it was  possible  to  secure- a  permanent settlement without  operations  on a more extended scale  than was  possible at thepresent time.ADDENDA.                                     YEMEN.       ;-     Confederacy against the Imam:- The Resident  at Aden telegraphed [366 A.P.] toSimla on the 22nd May  saying that the formation of the confederacy was primarilydue not to any pronounced hostility to the Imam himself but to his non-committal if notpro-Turk attitude;   Its first objective was the Turkish force in Yemen and Lahej, andit required a leader  of the Iinamic race,  hence the selection of Said Mohammed IbnYehia.  Should  the  Imam identify himself with  the  movement he  might possiblyretain his  position.   Without  assistance in money and ammunition the confederacywould be unable to keep  the  field  long enough  to secure the ejection of the turkish troops ; but with such assistance Yemen should be clear of them  by the end  of theyear.  If we did not help, it would look to Italy  and, judging  from local indications^not in vain.  The Resident thought that it could be  made quite  clear that we  werenot concerned in the  selection  of the confederate leader but were only impelled by anti-Turk motives.   Inaction and refusal  of assistance  would  permanently affect our prestige.                                     PERSIA.     The Gendarmerie. -In reply to Sir  C.  Marling&apos;s telegram  of  the  11th  May[Eastern  Report  XVI,  p.. 9], Lord  Robert  Cecil telegraphed  [No.  148] on the23rd May saying that no effort should be  spared to prevent the Persian government from applying for officers to Sweden or any other neutral country.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C.
