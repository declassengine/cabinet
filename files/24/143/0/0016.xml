SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT,  No. XVI.                                      RUSSIA.     DURING  the. last week the Provisional Government  has been enlarged by the addition of new men from the ranks of Socialist parties, and two of the most notable figures in the  first Provisional  Government have  been  compelled  to  resign,  viz., M. Gouchkoff,  the  late Minister for War, and M. Miliukoff,  the  late  Minister for Foreign Affairs.   To fill these two  most important offices come M. Kerensky, hitherto Minister of Justice, and M.  Terestchenko, hitherto Minister of  Finance.  Upon these two men now rests the gigantic  responsibility of  Russia&apos;s future  part in the present war.   M. Kerensky was the  one man in the first  Provisional Government who  seems to have had real influence with the forces of the proletariat  in Petrograd, and to have had some  measure  of their  confidence.   To judge from the very frank  and friendly discussions that  have been  reported in Sir G..  Buchanan&apos;s telegrams  between  our Ambassador and  the  new Foreign  Minister,  when  the latter was  still  Minister of Finance, we may feel encouraged by the  choice made.  The  only new Minister who is described as being a revolutionary Socialist of the Extreme Left is  M. Tchernoff, the Minister of Agriculture.     Even  more  serious than the disappearance of a really good man like M. Gouchkoff are the military resignations  that have been tendered during the last week.  Korniloff, the Commandant of Petrograd, and  Gruzinoff, the  Commandant of Moscow, have both been  forced to  resign.  From letters  giving an account of the earlier stages of the revolution  in Moscow it is clear that Gruzinoff was a man of great capacity and high patriotism in whom the mass of the people  in Moscow had justifiable confidence.  On the top of  these resignations conies the news that Generals Brusiloff and Gourko have submitted  theirs  also.   It  is only  a few  weeks  since the  former,  at any rate,  still contemplated  an early offensive, and nothing shows more clearly the rapid  development of events than the  tendering of this resignation. Only the complete breakdown of essential discipline and a feeling of hopelessness regarding  the present political situation  could have induced a man like General Brusiloff to seek withdrawal at such  a moment.    M. Rodzianko&apos;s statement to  our Ambassador  that he now regarded  civil war as inevitable  is gloomy reading both for the friends of  the Russian revolution and for Russia&apos;s allies.   However, one must realise that previous knowledge of Russia can help but little in forecasting what the new Russia will  do.  The  revolution sends us  ali to school again, to begin our lessons once again from the beginning.  All that  we can hope for is  that  whoever obtains the power  in Russia will also obtain the responsibility.  If the new Provisional Government cannot obtain and retain such powrer as will ensure to it the elementary functions of executive government, the sooner  it gives place to those who have the power the better; for in revolutionary conditions  a Government that isa Government in name only is but a mist that prevents us seeing the real forces that are working out the future developments underneath.    The speech  of Beretelli at the anniversary meetiugs of past and present members ofthe Duma  is well worth attention (vide telegram, p. 3).   Here we find the dogmas ofthe &quot; Internationale,&quot;  and  sentiments  originating with Karl  Marx in  their  mostdoctrinaire form, directed against Great Britain in particular.
    Even more interesting is the telegram from Odessa regarding the anti-English and pro--German sentiments of the Jews.  Russian Jewry, which  controls the provincialpress, is highly organised on Zionistie lines.  There is to be an important Zionist conferenceon the 6th June, and it maybe deemed desirable that this conference be made aware ofJemal Pasha&apos;s  Turanian massacres of the Jews in Palestine, and also of the  attitudeof Entente  Powers toward Jewish national aspirations.  Though this would  have little or no  effect in Petrograd, it might have important consequences in Southern Russia.The new attitude of the Rumanian Government toward the Jews may also prove helpful.    Information received during the last week tends to show that  extreme  opinion,hitherto mainly confined to Petrograd and the  north-west, has  spread to other centres in Russia.   The programme given  in Sir G. Buchanans  telegram  No. 709, especiallyitem No. 7, reveals  the stage now reached in the  development of a revolution that hasalready begun to &quot;devour its children.&quot;                                     Egypt.    The telegram regarding the demands of Abbas Hilmi the ex-Khedive raises thequestion as to how far  it is desirable in the interests of our future position in Egypt to admit  the&apos;  right of abdication.  Now  that  Egypt is  a  British Protectorate,  and wehave the right  to select  or dismiss whichever prince of the  House  of Mohammed Aliwe may select to occupy the throne of the newly-restored Sultanate, it is very doubtfulwhether any such arrangement with Abbas Hilmi  is politic or is other than a dangerousconstitutional precedent.   The ex-Khedive  is not  the  cause of unrest in Egypt.   Hisreputation among his own countrymen is  not such as  to  encourage  one to  pay a largeprice for his  nominal abdication.  Any oath he  took would not bind  his son, and  ifAbbas Hilmi again becomes powerful it would not  be  difficult  to find Ulema to declare that the oath given by a Moslem under circumstances of some  restraint to a Christianpower was  null and void.   Egyptian sentiment in such  a  matter  is probably one of resignation to the  decrees of  fate.  Abbas  Hilmi.has forsaken his throne,  and his powers have passed to  another.  It is the will of Allah ;  and what  man would be sucha fool as to worry about the past.  There are plenty of  better men than Abbas  Hilmiknown to the Egyptians who could form a centre of discontent  if such a centre be required.                                     ARABIA.    The unexpected confederation against the present Imam  Yahya is very welcome.Doubtless the  Arabs  are  sick  of a  man  who leans  upon Ali Said Pasha  and hisdwindling garrison.  One hopes that everything  possible will be done  to assist theseArabs to extinguish the last remnants of Turkish domination in South-Western Arabia.The final clearing up of the situation in Yemen is most desirable.    The statement in last week&apos;s report regarding the withdrawal of Colonel Bremondis seen to  have been a little premature.  Let  us  hope that nothing will stand  in theway of any arrangement  come to between King Hussein, M. Picot,  and Sir  MarkSykes at their meeting this week.    It is too much  to expect that Jemal Pasha&apos;s organised brutalities in Palestine willbe confined  to  the Jewish  colonies.  For  the past year  he has established a reign ofterror, and his hangings, tortures, and deportations lead one  to fear that the- populationof the Holy Land, Moslem and Christian alike,  are threatened with  Turanian  methodssuch as Turkey with Germany&apos;s connivance meted out to the Armenians at an  early stage in the war.

Buchanan telegraphed on the  14th May [No. 693 a]saying that he had called that morning on M. Thomas, and had found him in conver-sation with the President of the Duma.  The latter took a very pessimistic view of thesituation, saying that the Government which he  had helped to form would have to go.He feared that civil war was inevitable : and when the  time came the troops and work-men, though  they  quarrelled, among  themselves,  would  join forces.   The Duma no.longer existed as a legislative chamber, but he proposed to summon a private meetingof its members to consider what could be done.     In  the afternoon he had had a long conversation with the Minister of Finance,  whosaid that the time for action had come.  The Minister  of War  had not acted fairly intendering his  resignation ;  he ought to have  waited for  the  general crisis which had now arrived,  instead  of throwing on his  colleagues  the whole responsibility of itssolution.  He was right when he said that, if things continued as they were for anotherthree weeks,  the army would  cease to exist as a fighting  force.  The government recognised that the time had  come for action, and  it was encouraged by the appeal togive up fraternising with the enemy and  to take the  offensive, made  to  the  army bythe  Executive Council in  the  name of the workmen.  It  must, however, first of allstrengthen its own position and, win. the confidence of the  demooracy.     The, Workmen&apos;s  Council had  pronounced  against,  participating in  a  coalition government,  but the  Government proposed  to offer the Ministries of Agriculture,Labour,  and Posts, and perhaps the post of Assistant Minister of Interior, to membersof some of the parties represented in. the Council, and he believed that this offer wouldbe approved by the parties concerned.   Certain changes  were, however, necessary inthe  Government itself,  and  he was  going to  sneak with  perfect frankness about       [898-431                                            1              B
M. Miliukov, who did not represent the Governments views on foreign j)policy, and had,by his tactless treatment of certain questions, caused the Government serious embarrass-ment.   They had been  told by him  that  the Allied  Governments would insist onretaining him in his present post; and he (the  Minister of Finance) wanted to  knowwhether this was the case so far as the British Government was concerned, and whetherit would protest were he or Prince Lvov to replace M. Miliukov.  Sir G. Buchanan saidthat, though he could not reply officially to such a question, he was personally convincedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government, which never intervened in such purely internal matters,would give any Government that might be formed, or any one of its members thatmight be appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs,  its cordial support, provided that itwas assured that the new Government and the  new Minister for Foreign Affairs were determined to maintain order at home, to prosecute the war to a victorious  finish, andto respect the agreement concluded with the Allies.  The Minister of Finance repliedthat he could  give  me  on all  these  points the most  categorical  assurances that the prosecution of the war was the end and aim  of their policy, and that he believed thatM. Kerensky, as Minister of War, would be able to exercise a salutary influence on thearmy as a fighting&apos; force and to win it over to the side of the Government.   As regardsour agreements, though circumstances would,  he believed, force  us to revise  themeventually, the Government had no intention of pressing for their revision.     There was another matter on which he wished to speak to me, viz., that of Russia&apos;sdiplomatic representatives abroad.  It  was necessary that  the  Ambassadors at  paris and London should enjoy the confidence of  the Bussian democracy, and  M.  Isvolskiwould probably be replaced by M. Maklakoff, a leading Cadet.  As  regards  London he feared that His Majesty&apos;s Government would hold to M.  Sazonoff, but he was too muchidentified with  the  imperialist  policy  of the  late  Government, notably as  regardedConstantinople, to be a suitable representative  of  the Russian people  at  the presentmoment.   He was afraid  that  if he  went to London he  would,  sooner or later, bediscredited, and he wanted  to retain his  services for the peace negotiations.   he mentioned M. Schidlovski and the brother of present Russian Charge dAffaires as  themost probable candidates for the post.   Sir G. Buchanan said thatM. Sazonoff had, theGovernment knew, modified his  views with regard to Constantinople, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had such complete confidence in him that it would be  a  great  disappoint-ment if his appointment were cancelled.  If, however, he did not  go, the first of thetwo candidates named would be far preferable.     Sir G. Buchanan added that the situation had  once  more become so serious thatthe above-mentioned ministerial changes offered, in  his opinion, the only hope for themaintenance of internal order and for the prosecution  of the war.  The  democraticforces  were so  strong that the  Government,  if it was really  to  govern,  must itselfacquire a more democratic  complexion.  Without wishing to depreciate his services, hewas bound to admit that M. Miliukoff had been a stumbling-block  to the Governmentthroughout, and that he had treated the question of Constantinople in a tactless fashion.  Ishould personally much prefer to have to deal with M. Terestchenko, who really represents the views of the Government.  The Government proposed to offer M. Miliukoff anotheroffice, but it was very doubtful whether he would  accept it, and it was to  be feared that he and the Cadet party, of which he was the  leader, would not yield without  aserious struggle.     Resignations. Sir G.  Buchanan telegraphed on the 15th May [No. 688] that it hadbeen officially announcedthat General Korniloff, military governor of Petrograd, and ColonelGruzinoff,  military governor of Moscow, had  resigned.  The resignation of the formerhad been caused by the claim to the exclusive right to  dispose  of  troops made by heWorkmehs Council; a right which apparently they had not renounced  in spite of theofficial  communication  of the  Government  that  it could only be  exercised by  themilitary governor,  The Minister of  War had also tendered his resignation,  as he considered that the  time had come to make a firm stand on the question of discipline in the army.  He had, in recent speeches, painted the military situation in the darkestcolours, and he evidently felt that it was useless for him to continue the struggle.     M. Kerensky&apos;s position was said to be rather shaky as of late he had lost influence.Everything seemed to point to a new crisis at  an  early date, and Sir G. Buchanan saw no hope of things  righting themselves without  further bloodshed.   As to whether theGovernment would be able to count on the support of the troops was a moot question.     Meeting of the Duma. Sir  G. Buchanan telegraphed on the  11th May [No. 674]sajdng  that on the previous day, the eleventh  anniversary  of the  opening  of the first
 State  Duma, there was a  sitting of  the  Chamber  attended by all  the deputies who  have  been members  of all four Dumas.   The  Provisional  Government  and Executive Committee  of the Council of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies were present :- in full strength.      The   proceedings  opened  with  a highly  patriotic speech  by  the  President, Rodzianko, who expressed his entire approval of the declaration made by the Provisional Government in regard to the war.  His  statement  that there could be no question of a separate peace was  warmly recognised,  as were his sympathetic  references  to  the Allies.   He declared his confidence in  the army and in  the Provisional Government, which he said it was the  duty of all  Russians to  support.   The speech was heartily applauded by the public and by all sections of the Chamber except the Extreme Left.      Nabokov, leading K.D. of the first  Duma, amidst enthusiastic applause, reminded his listeners that the  English Prime  Minister was the first foreigner to  express his sympathy with  the Russian people in the dark days of the popular movement.      He was followed.by a Socialist deputy of the  first Duma who  indignantly denied that his party advocated a separate peace, and declared that the wdiole Labour party supported and trusted the Provisional  Government.      Shulgin, the  representative of  the  Moderate parties,  charged the Labour  and Socialist  parties with inconsistency in their openly  hostile  attitude and  propaganda against England.   He said  that their policy,  aimed  at a separate peace, had already produced anarchy in the country and complete disorganisation of its armed forces.  He complained of the disloyal attitude towards  the Provisional  Government,  and warned them of the grave clanger threatening  the  country because of their  political agitation among the densely  ignorant masses, and of their excitement  of class passions.      Beretelli, an  advanced  Socialist of the second Duma, summoned from political imprisonment in Siberia to join the Executive Committee  of  the Council of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Delegates,  declared he  had never heard- any such  propaganda  against England as stated by Shulgin.  His party opposed imperialistic and capitalist circles in England,  but had no quarrel with the English people,  whom the Russian working classes called to free themselves from  the  fetters of imperialism.  Pie denied that his party was spreading anarchy in the  provinces or  the  disorganisation of the army and navy, and said that he  believed  that  if necessary the  army would oppose to the the utmost the German imperialistic forces should they attack, but to crush militarism in a foreign country by force of arms was the best means of establishing imperialism within your own.   He denied that his party opposed the  Provisional  Government, whose honesty of motive was beyond doubt.   But the Russian people had not overthrown one autocrat to replace him by twelve, and it  was the  duty  of  the Russian proletariat to control a Government mainly composed of the bourgeois element.  If only the Govern- ment  would  display  more determination  in internal and foreign policy towards the realisation of the ideals of the democracy, the latter  would support the Government with the full weight of its authority.      Guchkov, the  Minister for War, delivered a pessimistic speech, declaring that the  country could not  live under the existing conditions of multiple authority, which was in fact no authority at all.   Only one last combined effort of the country was needed to  crush the  foe,  but the  armed  strength was  undergoing a process  of  internal  decomposition,  which,  if not speedily  dealt  with,  would  render  curative measures  useless.   He declared that the country  was on  the brink of ruin  as the result of the  activity of certain  parties whose watchword appeared to be  &quot; Peace at Front and  War  at  Home.&quot;       The Workmen&apos;s  Council. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 9th May [No. 657]  that in regard to the claim of the Workmen&apos;s Council to have exclusive right to dispose  of troops, the Government  had taken a  firm stand, and, in spite  of the  explanatory  statement issued on the 8th May, the former had published a communique&apos; to the effect  that this right  could only be exercised by  the military governor in Petrograd.  He said,  too, that the idea  of the formation  of a  coalition Government was not likely to be  realised.  The Provisional Government, however, was  inviting the Socialist parties in  the Workmen s Council to nominate  two  or three of their  members for seats in the  Government.   The Government would, he understood, reserve to  itself the right of  vetoing, the  appointment of any undesirable person,  as well  as  that of settling the  conditions of admission.  If any Socialists were now admitted to the Government, they  would probably not  replace  any of its present members, but  be appointed Ministers  without  portfolio.   The Minister of  Justice had  published a  letter stating that the  burden of representing the interests of democracy  in  the Government had become too
heavy for him to bear alone, and that democracy could no longer shirk bearing its shareof responsibility in the administration, now that it had organised its forces.     The Extremists. Sir  G. Buchanan  telegraphed  on  the 10th May [No. 666] that 0the extreme wing of the Social Democrat party had  decided that  they would send norepresentatives to any socialist conference at which Messrs. Borgberg and Scheidemannwere present, as these men suoported the imperialist government of Germany.   Ingeneral, he said, there were signs  that even the  extremists were waking  up  to the objects of such overtures as these.     The Jews. Sir  G. Buchanan  transmitted  on the 10th May [No. 658] a telegramfrom the consul-general at  Odessa, in which he said that everyone united in aifirmingthat the Jews were strongly in favour of Germany, and were working against England,who was represented  as Russia&apos;s worst enemy.  Jewish agitators pervaded every meeting in the towns and villages;  they were all young, the older ones were very reserved  andcounselled moderation, but were not listened to.  He had been told by a person whohad spoken  with an officer who had been a delegate at the Minsk Congress that themeeting had been in  hands of Jews : and that it had been decided to imprison the lateEmperor in a Petrograd fortress and eventually to kill him.  The  consul-general couldnot  vouch for  the  truth of this statement ; but he could say that, the Jews were verybitter against  the  late  Emperor, and he had been told  by one that the  Emperor had refused  to abdicate  in favour of his  son, as he knew such a step was not provided forand would lead to  anarchy and the victory of Germany.  He also said that the vice-consul at Nicolaieft&apos; had reported that the main theme of conversation was peace and thatthe local press (entirely Jewish) had published no war news.     Press Attacks on&apos;the  Allies. In his  telegram  of the 12th  May [No. 682] Sir G.Buchanan  said  that  the attacks  on the Allies  continued to be made by the Socialistpress  in  Petrograd,  and  the  &quot;Pravda &quot;had spoken of King  George as &quot; a crownedfree-booter.&quot;  Sir G. Buchanan pointed out to M.  Miliukoff  that when a paper was allowed to use such language about an Allied Sovereign,  and when we who, as a nation,had rendered Russia such inestimable services inthewai, were constantly being insulted,.it was no longer liberty of the press but licence ; he also told  him that the sympathiesof all British residents were  being utterly alienated, and they only wished to leaveRussia never to return.  M. Miliukoff said that  he would speak to the Government and see if anything could be done.     Position of British Mill-Owners, &amp;c. Sir  G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 13thMay [No. 693]  that he had received a committee  representing  600 British subjectsconnected with  local  mills, and seeking facilities  for their wives  and  children to  leaveRussia.  The position in the mill district was, they said, grave, and if the  workmen&apos;sexorbitant demands were to necessitate the closing of mills, they might have  a massacreof British mill-owners, mill hands, &amp;c.  The  men were determined to  remain, but they asked to be relieved of the anxiety caused by the presence of their wives and children of whom there  were  350 in the district in question.   They quite understood his desireto avoid the appearance of panic, which would still further embitter the feeling against   jthe English in Russia and aggravate the situation of those who  remained ;  and wouldbe entirely guided by him as to the means to be adopted to repatriate their families inthe least obtrusive  way possible.   He  had  received somewhat  similar  requests from Moscow and Odessa,  and there was no doubt that the position of British subjects in the manufacturing  districts throughout  Russia was  most precarious.   In the event of serious disturbances, there  was no force for  the  restoration of order at the  disposal of  \ the Government.      Situation in Moscow and Odessa. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 12th  May   1 [No. 682] saying that the consuls-general at Moscow and Odessa had sent him accounts   \ of the situation in those places which showed that it was becoming rapidly worse, and that it was even more disquieting than the situation at  Petrograd.  The consul-general&apos; at Moscow reported that everybody there was tired of the &apos;&apos; deplorable war,&quot; and that the   j desire for peace was  the direct reason  of the  anti-ally feeling.   In  one  of &quot;the  great   \ manufacturing centres the men, had. threatened  to suck the  British mills, and all the   1 English women and  children had to be sent  to Moscow.     -                            I      The British Independent Labour  Party. Sir  G.  Buchanan  telegraphed on  the   I 10th May [No. 651] that he had been  informed by M. Miliukoff that the  Workmen&apos;s   I
Council had requested him to press the British Government to permit representativesof the Independent Labour Party to come to  Petrograd,  and  M. Miliukoff had asked him to pass on the Council&apos;s request.   Sir G.  Buchanan, in reply, said  that  he should(? prefer) that any communication M. Miliukoff wished to  make on the  subject shouldbe made through the  Russian Embassy in London : he himself was  not in favour ofsuch a visit, as it would only promote  further peace propaganda that would  prejudiceinterests of Allies.   Sir George Buchanan feared, however, that  if the Governmentwas  approached on the  subject  it would he very difficult to  refuse permission.   TheWorkmen&apos;s Council was determined to collect representatives  of the different socialist parties  in  allied countries, and  a  refusal on our part  would  raise  a fresh outcryagainst us.     On the 11th May  the Bussian  Charge&quot;  d&apos;Affaires communicated  to the ForeignOffice the text of a circular telegram containing the request of the Executive Committeeof the Workmen&apos;s Council in this regard :          &quot; The Executive Committee express the hope that the Governments of Great     Britain, France,  and Italy will  not refuse to grant  facilities for the journey to     Russia to  the delegations of the  Italian Social-Democratic Party, tbe  British     Independent Labour and Social-Democratic Parties, and of  the  Opposition Group     cf the French Socialist Labour Party who have been  invited  to Petrograd.   The     Executive Committee would be grateful for a favourable reply.&quot;                                    POLAND.   -  The Answer of the Polish Council of State to the  Russian Proclamation. the intelligence Bureau reports  that at its  last plenary meeting on the  6th   pril theProvisional Council of  State, having considered the proclamation to the  Poles made bythe Russian Provisional Government, passed the following declaration unanimously :      The European war has made the Polish question the great problem of internationalpolitics in the arena of the world.  Our nation understood that its secular aspirationsmust now be realised,  and the self-sacrificing part  played  by the legions [which have fought on the side of the Central Powers] which of their  own initiative entered thestruggle for Polish independence, was the living expression of those aspirations;   ThePolish  question could  be solved only by the  creation of a Polish State.  The Govern-in ents of the Central Powers were the  first to  grasp  this  historic need.   The Act  of[of the Central Powers] the 5th November [1916] called to life an independent PolishState, though it  left its territorial  limits undefined.   Now  the  Russian  ProvisionalGovernment also acknowledges the independence of our fatherland, thus affirming thatit is an absolute  historic necessity to wash  off  the  bloody stain of enslavement which for  a century has dishonoured Europe.  But  the new Russian Government offers thePoles territories which  it does not hold ; it leaves it to the constituent assembly to settle the  limits of the Polish State,  and, moreover, shadows a  military union  of  the twoStates.   Any binding  condition imposed  on us  is an  essential restriction  of  indepen-dence,  and is incompatible with the honour of a free nation.   The Provisional Councilof State greets the ray of liberty which has illuminated the darkness of that  immensetomb.in which all the nationalities inhabiting the wide expanse of  the Russian  Statelived in slavery.  It also notes with satisfaction  the fact that the new Russian Govern-ment acknowdedges the principle of Polish independence.  At the same time it emphasised-sises the fact that the  ancient contest between Poland and Russia for the vast lands whichintervene between their several national territories, and which  for centuries belonged to poland, has now been closed.   We cannot leave the settlement of that  question to the arbitrary decision of the Russian Constituent Assembly.   The fate of these countriesmust be defined in accordance with the State interests of independent  Poland, whilsttaking into consideration the will of the nationalities inhabiting these territories.   TheProvisional Council of State clearly sees  its  aims :  a constitutional monarclry, a strongGovernment,  a numerous army ; these are  the tasks which  we have  to  solve.   we desire  to maintain in future good-neighbourly relations with the Russian State, but wemust enter  a protest  against all suggestions  of making war  on  the Central Powers,whose  monarchs have guaranteed our independence. The nations of Europe winch shedtheir blood  do not desire  a  long  war,  but  peace.  The independent Polish State,announced by the  Act of the 5th  November,  1916, and  now acknowledged by theGovernment of Russia, whcih arises to  a new life, ought to form the  basis  for opening       [898--43]                                                           C
peace negotiations, and for rendering permanent in future normal conditions  of life iiiEurope.     [In  regard  to  this declaration, Mr. L. B. Namier,  who prepared  the report on poland for the Intelligence Bureau, says that the Council of State  has been preparedfor a Polish Government and army since January 1.916.   Strongly supported  by Polishpublic opinion, and aided  to some extent by the rivalries and jealousies which divide the  Central Powers in regard to  Poland,  it succeeded in gaining  authority at theirexpense.  .... The Poles had reached the most favourable juncture for realising theiraims and therefore desire  peace negotiations to be started immediately.   During thecoming months, he says, the  Poles  will be  found strenuously working for peace, andtheir endeavours in this direction are the more dangerous as their legitimate aspirationshad sympathisers in every European  Chancery  (except,  perhaps, m Berlin).  And in another part of his report  he suggests that  it is quite likely that the Central powers will  take some  definite step  in  the  direction  of furthering the  Polish  Imperialists&apos;claims in order to create thereby a new ground  for  discord between the Poles and theRussians.]                                   RUMANIA.     M. Bratiano. Sir G.  Barclay telegraphed on the 9th May [No. 251] saying thathe had   been  shown, by  the  military attache, a  document  styled &quot; SupplementarySummary of Intelligence,  No.  287 series,&quot; in which it was stated that the French and italians desired M. Bratiano&apos;s fall.  Sir G. Barclay did not believe that this was ever true,at least as regarded the French Minister ; if the War Office had any reason to  thinkthat he was wrong, he should  like  to know it.  The French  Legation did not  thinkhighly of M. Bratiano, but that was  a very different thing from the French Ministerhaving ever desired his fall : he had always  assured him to the contrary.     Proposed Visit  of Members of the Russian Duma. With reference to Sir G.Barclay&apos;s telegram of  the  4th May [Eastern Report  XV,  p. 3]  Sir G. Buchanantelegraphed on the 9th May  [No.  652] that he had  asked M. Miliukoff whether theGovernment proposed to  send two  members of  the Duma to Jassy.  It was impossibleto find the right men at present, as all the leading members were occupied with  other things.   The Roumanian Prime Minister agreed with M. Miliukoff in thinking that inthese circumstances it is better to send no one.     Tlie Jews.-Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 8th May [No. 244] that many hadsuspected  the loyalty  of the Jews  during the scare of the  preceding  days.   Thesenotifications had elicited  a most loyal manifesto from  the Committee of the JewishUnion.   Telegraphing again on the 12th May [No. 255] he said that a deputation of theJewish Union had been received by the King, who (? promised) it  that  all  Jews whohad  suffered  or fought for the  cause would be given  full political rights in GreaterRoumania.  In another telegram [No. 257] he gave the actual words of the King in this regard :          &quot; All those  who have  struggled  for  the realisation of our time-honoured     aspirations, shedding  the  blood and enduring their difficulties and sacrifices imposed     by the war  and the invasion of the country, whether they be Christian, Jew, or of     any other belief,  will  have earned the gratitude of the country  and the King, and     will enjoy equal rights in  a great free and prosperous Rumania closely united  under     the  national flag.&quot;                                     EGYPT.     The Late Khedive. Sir H.  Rumbold telegraphed from Berne  on  the 15th  May[No. 368] that through a  confidential agent the Ex-Khedive had informed Lord Actonthat he was willing to sign an act of abdication leaving to his son the settlement  of hisposition  in respect to the succession.  His Highness asked that he should  receive an allowance equal  to that paid to his grandfather  when  in  exile, and that the enjoyment of his property in Egypt should be guaranteed to him.  A claim in respect of property in Turkey  was no longer mentioned.                                  ABYSSINIA.     Requests of Arms. Lord Bobert Cecil telegraphed  to Sir R. Rodd on the 14thMay [No. 880] saying that at the request of the French  Government he had  instructedMr.  Thesiger  to inform the Abyssinian Government that in refusing requests for arms
I  the French Government had acted in complete agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-j  ment.  He added that he understood  that  the French  Government  had  asked theI  Italian Government to send similar instructions, and had deferred its formal refusal ofI  the recent Abyssinian  demand for  16,000  rifles till Mr.  Thesiger and  his  Italian  colleague had made a communication in the desired sense.                                     ARABIA.  HEJAZ.      Submission  of Shaykhs. The  Arab  Bureau  telegraphed  on the  14th  May  [A.B.  490] that  a report had  been  received from  Wej announcing &apos; that eighteen  important Abdah  Shammar Shaykhs, bringing letters  from Ibn Ajil and other leaders,  had come to Sherif Abdullah to assure him of their neutrality.  They assert they were  deceived by Ibn Rashid. who stated that Hejaz had been invaded by the British.   Feisal  reported that deputations came to Wei on  the 11th from Ibn Nadhal and Ibn  Mijlad,  asking pardon for having  helped the Turks, and offering their services to  the  Sherif.  It  was asserted that Ajeishi Saadun had also written similarly.      King Hussein&apos;s Subsidy. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 10th May [No. 504]  that Sir Mark Sykes was  leaving again for Jeddah  on the  15th  May  with M. Picot.  His impressions confirmed Sir  R. Wingate&apos;s opinion as to the desirability of  incr?asing  the present subsidy, and it would be of great  value  if Sir Mark  could inform King  Hussein at the  next  meeting   that  the  latter&apos;s  request  for an  increase  had  been.  favourably considered.      The French Military Mission. Lord Robert  Cecil telegraphed to Lord Bercie in  regard to this matter [Eastern Report XV, p.  8] on the  12th May [No. 1243] saying  that he should represent to the French Government  that it was most  desirable that  the French military mission to Hejaz, which had fulfilled  its object, should now be  removed.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  did  not  desire to lay stress  on  the  undue  activity shown by the mission in pressing upon King Hussein proposals  for a bank, for  wireless telegraphs, for coinage, and for  railways, which were altogether  premature,  and had had  a disturbing effect uoon His  Highness.  But members of the mission  appear, unfortunately  without exception, to be out of sympathy with  Arab aspiratiods,  and showed their feelings openly.   Their  attitude could not but prejudice  the allied  relations  and policy  in Hejaz, and might  even affect  the whole  future  of  French  relations  with  the Arabs,  In these  circumstances  the presence  in  Plejaz  of two  missions with divergent aims and methods could  not but react unfavourably on the allied  cause  in  Arabia,  and Plis Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly hoped  that the  French  Government would agree to withdraw the  French mission in the general interest of the  joint policy of the two Governments.      Lord Bertie  should  say that  Sir  M. Sykes  had reported strongly in that sense,  and that M. Picot was understood  to  share his  views ; and he should suggest that  Colonel Bremond and  his stall&apos;  might be absorbed into M. Picofs mission, and  that, if  required,  a&apos; French  liaison officer  might  be attached to  Colonel Wilson&apos;s staff at  Jeddah.      The  Proposed Italian &quot;Mission&quot; [see Eastern  Report XV,  p. A].-sir R. Rodd  telegraphed from Rome on the  10th May [No. 412] that  Baron Sonuino had informed  him that the party proceeding to Jeddah was only a group of Modem Italian subjects who  were going to make arrangements for pilgrims and construct shelters as  had  been done  by the party which the French  Government had sent.   There was absolutely no political  aim in view;  and he would not admit that the party could be dignified  by the name of  a mission.  Sir R. Rodd had suggested that the disturbed conditions in Arabia might make  the moment unpropitious, but  Baron Sonnino had said that they had heard thatchings  were  quite quiet  at Jeddah.   Sir R. Rodd thought that  the Italians were  anxious  to  influence their  own Moslem subjects  by showing them  the  advantages of the  new  situation.   If the French had sent such  a party  it would be  difficult  to make  a  distinction.  YEMEN&quot;.     - Confederacy  against the Imam. The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 15th  May [359  A.P.] that  he had received  letteis from various  notable  persons informing        [898-43]                                                          D
him  that  the  tribes qf Yemen had  decided  to pyerthrow the  present  Imam and  tosupport as his  successor a son of $aid Mahomed bin Yebia, of the Kasim house of theSaids of Sanaa (his name has  not yet  been  made  public  in  Yemen) and  to eject theTurkish trpops from Yemen.                                                        ^     It was a representative and strong confederapy, and indicated that there was a fixeddetermination  to depose the present Imam, who had lost  all hold over the tribes andclung to the Turks as his hope, even though he  might be well disposed to us and to theKing of Hejaz.     The Idrisi apparently  was cognisant and  favourable to the plot  to depose the imam and eject the Turks.   He did not know of the  intention to instal a new Imam ;it was considered probable that he would co-operate with any Imam except the present one,  and that each would be content with his own sphere of influence.     The letters and messengers showed that  the ponfederacy must  have some strongpower  behind  thein, and they preferred the British.   But the messengers stated  that even without pur assistance action would be  taken, as they were committed  to it; theassistance they asked for was arms and ammunition, transport, and money.  A  messengerarrived on the 14th May who belonged to the Kharif section of the Hashid tribe.   Hehad brought letters from Shaykh Sarhan ibn Sarhan Al Mohjani and four  other Shaykhsof the  Kharif  section.  These letters  confirmed  the above intelligence  and  showed thatthe  movement started about  October last  and had now  taken  definite shape.  Itappeared that  some action  had already commenced, and the differences  reported somemonths ago between the Imam and  his son  had reference thereto.   From this corre-spondence and information  the Resident  thought that we must accept the fact thatImam Yehia was totally discredited, and he added that he should be glad to  receive anearly order as  to the recognition he should give  to the confederacy.                                  PALESTINE.     Turkish Outrages against the  Jews. -Sir R. Wingate on the  11th  May transmitteda telegram [No. 505] from a committee of Jews in Cairo saying that the entire Jewishpopulation at Jaffa had been expelled towards the north during the Passover, and thepopulation in flight had been robbed with the  connivance of the Turkish authorities.Jews who  resisted  the  pillage were  hanged.   Thousands  were wandering helplessly onthe roads, starving, overcrowding the colony, increasing  misery and disease.  Masses,too, of young Jerusalem Jews  had been  deported  northward, their destination  beingunknown.   The forcible evacuation of the colony was imminent.     On the 14th May Lord  Robert Cecil telegraphed  to Sir R. Wingate  [No.  491]saying that a sum of 5,000i. was  held at the disposal of  the special committee, whichmight draw  on Dr. Weizmann to that amount.   A further sum could be  provided when required. He would, however,  be glad to know how it was proposed to afford relief and what steps the special committee would adopt, as it was obvious  that strict supervisionwould be necessary.  The Netherlands Government, approached by Jacobus Kahn, had undertaken to ascertain, through their Minister  at Constantinople, how matters stood inPalestine.   It  might iae possible to enlisf the assistance  of the  Dutch diplomatic and consular officials in Turkey  to supervise the relief.                                MESOPOTAMIA.    .     Relations with  Tribal  Chiefs. Sir P.  Cox telegraphed on 8th  May saying thatnews had been received from Ibn Saud by letter up to the end of March.  He was then in Qasim, and his brother, Abdur  Rahman, on the Qasim-Hail border.   There had recently been a conflict between Ibn Rashids tribes  and  the Harb and Hatman, underIbn Saud, and the latter claimed to have killed forty men  and captured 200 horses.  IbnRashid was  said to have retired to Salma.   The season has arrived for  large carayansfrom Hail tp visit Nejef and its vicinity for supplies. There was not at  present sufficienthold over the  tribes on. the  Lower Euphrates between Nejef and Samawa to make sure of preventing  this, but pressure was  being put  on our friends at  Nejef to refuse accessand  on Saud Ibn Saleh to endeavour to intercept the caravans  on the  way  to orfrom Hail.     He also said  that it had not so far been possible to  establish effective touch withthe tribal  shaykhs of northern Mesopotamia and the western Syrian desert.     As regarded Anazeh Amarat, Fahad  Beg had been in friendly communication withSaud es Saleh, and on the 17th March told him to inform &quot; his friend&quot; (that is Leachman)&quot; to  let Baghdad know he would agree to  what was necessary.&quot;  He apparently still

Buchanan telegraphed on^the 14th June[No.  889] that Count Sobanski  had  informed him that  he and his friends werearranging to send  a number of Polish officers,  commissioned and non-commissioned, fortraining  purposes,  the number sent depending on the number of men enrolled.   he hoped to be able to give the names of the officers  shortly, but it would be well, he said,in the meantime if the allied Governments were to ask the Provisional Government for permission for officers to leave Russia in order to undertake the training of Polish troopsin the United States.   He said too that he should be glad to know  as soon as possiblethe number of troops likely to be raised, and whether they would be placed under theorders of the French or of the British commander-in-chief when they went to France.                                 ,   TURKEY.     Eyoub Sabri.-Sir W. Townley telegraphed from  The Hague  on  the 16th June[No. 1708] that the following had been  received from  the Netherlands  Minister in constantinople : The Grand Vizier had  informed him  verbally  that  six  prominentBritish subjects (among them Dr. Frew) would be arrested and deported if Eyoub Sabrishould not be allowed to leave  Malta for a neutral  country.  He (the Minister) hadprocured a delay of seventeen days.   Public  opinion,  he said, was much upset at the detention of Sabri, and it was possible that further reprisals would  be made.  Exchangeagainst General Townshend would.not be granted.                                     EGYPT.     The late Khedive.  [See Eastern  Report, XVI, p.  6 ; XVIII, p. 5].-Sir R. Wingatetelegraphed on the 16th June [No. 641] that the Sultan had no observations to make on the proposed agreement for the  abdication of the late Khedive :  he himself concurred in it.  Consequently, Mr. Balfour  telegraphed  to Sir H.  Rumbold  on  the  19th June[No. 594] that the late  Khedive  might be approached by Lord Acton with a view toconcluding an agreement with hint on the lines laid down in  telegram No. 521 to Sir R.Wingate.  [Eastern Report,  XVIII, p. 5.]                                 SOMALILAND.     Letter from,  the  Mullah. Mr.  Archer,  in a  despatch dated the 15th April,forwarded the following translation of a letter received from the Mullah:      I have received  the last letter  from the English camp.  In this letter there  isone  noteworthy remark, viz., a  reference asking what Ali Kenedid has done to thedervishes,  and also what  Ina Ali Shirreh has  done  to the dervishes,  and also whatSultan  Osman  Mahmud  has done to the  dervishes.   In that letter, too,  it  wassuggested we were in communication with the Abyssinian,0 and had  dealings with theGermans  and the  Sultan  of Turkey ;  perhaps  feeling weak we required assistance.The suggestion in your  letter,, is that,  if  we  were strong people,  we  should  nothave had recourse to such friendships.   This  is  the  outstanding  feature  of  theletter, and  now  for  the . reply.   I tell  you,  you  fool,  by  now yon will know what I  have  done to tbe  Mijjertein and  to  the Warsangli.    And  you  know and I know what the Turks have  done to you  and what the  Germans have done to you, you of the British Government.   The suggestion is  that  I was weak, and hadto  look  outside for friends ;  and if, indeed, this  were true and I had  to  look  forassistance, it is only because of the British and the  trouble you have given me.  It isyou who have joined  with all the peoples  of the world, with people who  are  harlots,with wastrels and with slaves, only, because you are so weak.  But, if you were strong,you would have stood by yourself as  we,  independent and free.   It is  a sign  of yourweakness, your  alliance with Somalis, Jiberti (Mogadisoch  people and  sweepers), and arabs, and Soudanese, and Kaffirs, and perverts,  and  Yemenis, and Nubis, and  Indiansand Baluchis, and French  and Russians,  and  Americans,  and Italians, and Serbians,* Lij Yasu.
hesitated to send letters, in case of accidents, but he was now moving northwards towardsKerbela, and we should no doubt soon be in touch with him.  He was reported on goodauthority to have summarily rejected a recent proposal from Ajaimi Saadun to pay him a visit.     On the  Euphrates line the Delaim,  with headquarters  at Rumadi, were stilldominated  by the Turks  and actively hostile, while above us on the Tigris the  enemycontrolled channels of communication in that direction.     As regards the Rualleh, according to a report received from Ibn Subhan, dated first week in April, Nawwaf Shaalan has, under pressure from Turkish  Government, arrivedat an understanding with  Ibn Rashid.   This needs confirmation.     Administration  of  the Vilayets. Mr.  Chamberlain telegraphed to the Viceroy onthe 10th May saying that His Majesty&apos;s  Government did not contemplate the immediateestablishment of am  Arab  administration on the principles indicated in  his telegram ofthe  29th March.   It was concerned  that nothing  should be done during the military occupation  that would prejudice the subsequent introduction of these principles, and inparticular the establishment of separate administrative systems  for Baghdad and Basra.But, it fully realised  that the army commander and the chief political officer should havea free hand, and, subject to a clear understanding on the above-mentioned point, Sir P.Cox might  carry on  (in  consultation with the army commander) as heretofore until,  ashe had suggested, the whole problem had been examined and reported on by a commis-sion.  Questions such as the creation of administrative councils, a permanent judicialsystem, and the  regulation of  Indian immigration,  were to  be reserved for theconsideration of the commission.  Meantime,  only such a minimum of administrativeefficiency should be aimed at as was necessary to meet the needs of the occupying forceand to preserve order.   The amendment of laws and the introduction of reforms  shouldbe  kept within the narrowest possible limits..   And the personnel, both of the clericalestablishment and of the higher branches,  should  not ordinarily be drawn from Indiaunless and  until it had been ascertained that Egypt and Sudan  could not supply them.                                    PEBSTA.     The Cabinet. Sir C.  Marling telegraphed on the 11th May [No. 166]  saying thathe proposed, in the event of a change of Government, to  inform  the new Prime minister that no interference  with the efforts we were making to  restore  the authority  of thePersian Government in the south,  as, for  instance, by changes of Governors or othersuperior officials, would be admitted.     In a second telegram of the same date  [No. 167] he said that  while the Shah wasfinding a new  premier, Vossuk-ed-Dowleh  retained office on sufferance.   He thoughtthat there  would be  little or no advantage in forcing Shah to retain Vossuk-ed-Dowlehas the forces attacking him were so strong.   On the other  hand, he thought that  fear ofstoppage of the moratorium payments,  whence the  Shah  drew  his civil list,  would prevent the formation of any markedly hostile combination, though the  inclusion  ofsome pro-German elements was insisted  upon.   For the moment he said Ain-ed-Dowlehseemed to be most likely candidate for the premiership.     In regard to this Lord Robert Cecil telegraphed on the  13th May [No, 139]  sayingthat he left to Sir C. Marling full discretion as to supporting any suitable  candidate as new premier.  This month&apos;s payment of moratorium had been made on the  9th May.He was authorised to let it  be understood at any time, if and when such a  courseappeared desirable, that unless His Majesty&apos;s Government was satisfied in regard to the composition of any new Cabinet, no  further payment -would be made.     The Gendarmerie. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 11th May [No.  165]  sayingthat  he had  several times  been  asked by  the Persian  Government whether HisMajesty&apos;s  Government would object to its applying  to the  Swedish or some other neutral  Government  to  lend officers to replace the remaining Swedish officers, whoseincapacity  was  disorganising the existing  gendarmerie.  In reply, he had pointed outthat the Russian Legation should  be consulted  on a  matter  which concerned  Russiamore directly than us.   Sir C. Marling was not aware that the three Swedes still therehad shown  incapacity.   The suggestion  was sure to be revived by the new Cabinet  asa preliminary to attempting to increase gendarmerie at the expense of Cossack division,which he   had said,  when  approached on  the  matter,  should  be capable of securingtranquillity in the neighbourhood of the capital before any real improvement could beeffected in  the gendarmerie.
ADDENDUM.                                     RUSSIA. &apos;     Coalition Ministry. Sir G. Buchanan  telegraphed on the  16th May  [No. 709],saying that the General Council of &quot;Workmen and  Soldiers&apos; Deputies had approved theformation of a Coalition Ministry,  and had authorised the  Executive  Committee tocontinue its negotiations with the Provisional Government in this sense.  The following are stated to be the main conditions on which the representatives of the Socialist parties will enter the Ministry :      1. An active foreign policy directed towards the speediest possible attainment of a           general peace without annexations or contributions, based  on the  express           will of the people, and negotiations with  the Allies for a revision  of their           agreements with Russia  on the basis of the declaration of the  Provisional           Government oi the 9th April.     2. The democratisation of the army and the improvement of  the fighting effective-           ness at the front for the proper defence of Russian freedom.     3. The re-establishment of internal order by the State control of food supplies and           transport.                                      -     4. An agrarian policy on the basis of land for the people.     5. The reorganisation  of the existing&apos;  financial  system with a view to the trans-           ference of the  burden  of taxation  to the wealthy  and property-owning           classes.     6. The earliest possible meeting of the constituent assembly.     7. Socialist Ministers to be  responsible- to the Council of Workmen and Soldiers&apos;           Deputies.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R. HARRISON.--18/5/1917.

- 1.91 -224ARABIA.The Next Caliphate.     It is agreed that neither  the  nomination nor the establish - meat of a Caliph is any business of  a Christian Power : but we are virtually committed,  by a  message sent through  the  Emir of  Mecca to the Arab  people  (August oO, 1915), to &quot;approve&quot; an  Arab Caliphate, whenever  established  by Arabs in  common. When  that  message was  framed,  it  was, perhaps, not  realized that diplomatic, or any official, &quot; approval &quot; of a Caliph as such by a Christian Power would  be a novelty.   Has any Ottoman Sultan   been  addressed by a British  Chancery  as  &quot; Caliph &quot; Or  &quot; Prince of  the Faithful &quot;  or other  such title  ?    Elizabeth, or  her ministers,  styled  Sultan  Suleiman,  &quot; Defensor Fidei,&quot; when his help was  being solicited against Philip of Spain : but, if* the  Protestant faith  was  not intended,  the  title was probably Inserted merely as a  convention  appropriate in  addressing so great a sovereign.     Our official acknowledgement of Caliphs  as such  has never gone  much   beyond  the  negative   attitude  adopted  by  the Government of India, which does  not interfere with the practice of praying for the Ottoman Sultan in the Khutha, even when a state of  war  exists between  him  and  ourselves.   Nor, in  theestablishment of our  Protectorate, did we  really make any  new departure, though, in a letter  from Sir Milne Cheetham  to the sultan, allusion  was  made  to the Ottoman Caliphate as not affected by  our action in a country  no longer politically  con-nected with Constantinople.     We are, however, almost certainly destined to be asked sooner or later to signify our &quot;approval&quot; by some official action more posi-tive  than we have ever taken hitherto in regard to the Caliphate.If formally  approached  by a  new  Caliph, we could hardly, forexample, be at one and the same time &quot;approving&quot; his Caliphateand  continuing to suffer Indian Moslems to pray publicly for anOttoman Caliph.   Yet that such a dilemma may arise is not outof the question.   There  has often been  more than one &quot;Caliph(there are, at least, two  at present), and,  even in sadly reducedcircumstances,  the Ottoman  Sultan maj&apos;  continue  to commendhimself to  many Moslems by force of tradition and  habit, morethan  a new  Caliph  not  particularly  powerful and  suspected of dependence on Christendom.     The  only possible  justification  of that  negative attitudeof ours in  India and  elsewhere  resides in  our  official   pre-tence that the Caliphate is only a spiritual headship,  no longerimplying  temporal dominion  over  Moslems  in general.   Thisview lies obscurely behind the reference in Sir Milne  Cheetham&apos;sletter quoted above,  and  is  not inconsistent,  with  any  of the subsequent   references  to  the Caliphate  which  occurred inofficial  communications  from  Lord Kitchener and  Sir. Henrvassurances  given to the at the  time of  the
McMahon to the Emir of; Mecca.  ..-A  pretence, indeed, it  is asturdy, conscious fiction,   it does not affect facts, but only ourimperial relation to them.  The  facts are,  of course,  that theImamate, not the Caliphate,, is the purely spiritual headship ofIslam; that  the Caliphate in  its  institution was both temporaland spiritual, and has  never  since been divorced from temporaldominion held either by the  Caliph  himself or by  some  greatMoslem  sovereign of  whom he was the alter ego ; and that it isstill associated  by  Sunnis, not  only  with  temporal  dominionactually enjoyed by the Caliph, but with a right and an aspirationto  temporal  dominion  over all Moslems in the fulness of time.A  leading  European  authority  on  Islamic history,  law  and practice, Dr.  Christian  Snouck-rlurgronje, Professor of Arabic atLeiden, and once resident in Mecca for several months,, wrote lastyear  (Lectures., on  Mohammedanism, p. 131).    &quot; A  Westernstate, that.admits any authority of a Khalif over its Mohammedansubjects, acknowledges not  the authority of a pope of the MoslemChurch, but in simple ignorance is feeding political programmes,which,  however vain,  always  have  the   power  of  stirringMohammedan masses to confusion and excitement.&apos;&apos;     The problem that will be set before  us, if an Arab. Cafiphateis established, is how to &quot;approve&quot; an institution,  which, impliesa claim  inconsistent with our sovereignty,, without admitting&apos;that  claim. .  It can  only be solved  by  persevering with thesturdy  official   pretence  already   mentioned.    By   stating,  itexplicitly as our official view, in   our  terms of &quot;approval,&quot;  weshall, in a sense, remove it from  the  region  of  pretence to thatof relative reality.  Though Moslems as a whole do not regard aCaliph as analogous  to a Pope, it is perfectly reasonable, for. usto  say that  we, for our  part, do so regard him;  Le.,  in hisrelation to&apos;our  Moslem subjects, and  those  of  our Allies, and.indeed, everywhere outside his own realm, he has, qua Caliph, aspiritual position only.   Even Moslems have proposed that suchshould be his position.   One of the earliest items in  the C.U.P.programme  was the  divorce  of  Church  from State;  by thedetachment  of  the   Caliphate  from  the   Sultanate,  and  itscommittal to some Sherif (Ali  Haidar, the present &quot; Pretender &apos;&quot;to the Emirate of Mecca, was suggested), who would live in . asmall guaranteed &quot; Vatican reservation,&quot; perhaps near Damascus.The  idea, therefore,  is   not quite  unknown,  nor  necessarilyinacceptable,  by Moslems.   [See below, p. 193,  for an indication that this idea has not been forgotten by the CP.P.]    To adoptit hardily and openly as our view  of the Caliphate to-day seemsthe only course, which  will enable us to make good our under-takings, and at  the same time maintain  common  consistency and self-respect.     The general consent of the Arabs,  however, will  not easily be accorded to any new  Caliph  unless  and  until he has provedhimself conspicuously  powerful  without Christian help ; and,should an  Ottoman Sultan survive, non-Arab  Moslems  will be.slow to transfer their allegiance, except to  some prince  deemed
likely  to  increase  the  Dai&apos;  el-Islam.   This  last consideration,however,  is  not germane.    We are  pledged  to consider thewishes of  the Arabs alone, so far as their Caliphate is concerned.                                                I), G. 11.                           Hejaz.                         intelligence.     One  of our  patrol ships  paid a  visit to Akaba on  April 20,and  put a party  on shore to attack the  post of  from sixty toeighty Turks, who were entrenched there.  Part of  their trencheswas taken without, loss  to ourselves, and the enemy, leaving twodead and  eleven  prisoners,  withdrew to the hills.  Two boats, alarge one, and a small one, recently brought down overland, were destroyed or  captured, and some ten mines were taken out of thesea:  but no store of mines  was discovered  on shore.     A  report,  transmitted  through Switzerland, and given here for what  it is  worth,  states that  Fakhri Pasha has informed hisGovernment that, unless he can be re-supplied with ammunition,he must  surrender  Medina.   From  similar  secondary  sourcescome indications that the advisers of the C.U.P., while not ceasingto, promote Neo-Turanian  propaganda, are more disposed thanchey were  to try  to court  the Arabs and  keep control of Islam.They are said to be organizing, in  concert with the Germans, an anti-British  movement  amongst  Arabs: and  King Husein,  on being advised of  this report by us, was disposed to credit it, and improved  the occasion  by remarking  that, bad and  &quot; disorderly &quot;as Turks  and Germans may be, they still  understand that the true  basis of Tslam  is Arab !   We have further been informed,though  from a. doubtful source,  that the Turks are prepared tooffer King Husein a spiritual  Caliphate without temporal power.If there is anything in  this report,  it indicates a  return by theO.U.P.  to its earliest  programme, mentioned on p. 192.  KingHusein  is very unlikely to look at such a  proposal, but we havenot yet heard any comments of his on the report.     The Muadhdhain station affair took place on April  14.  Thedetachment  sent  by Feisal  numbered about  L,000 Arabs  and  afew  Turkish soldier-deserters, with  two  mountain  guns, twomachine guns and an  automatic gun.  The line was cut in fiveplaces between stations, from Khainis to Dar el-Hamra, and thestation  buildings and fort  of Muadhdham  were attacked ;  butthough  the desultory fight lasted  some hours no impression wasmade.   The  Bedouins kept well away  under cover as  soon  asthey heard  machine-guns  begin  to  rattle, and  only  YuzbashiMalud,  a Baghdadi, who was wounded twice, with  a tew trained men  ever  attacked.   They behaved most gallantly,  but the artillery fire  was  ineffective owing  to lack  of  high  explosive
shells,  which  had unaccountably been  left  behind.   In  the end the Arabs, being without water, retired with a loss of  ten  deadand forty-five wounded.  The Turkish casualties are uncertain.The Arabs took six Turkish prisoners from the repairing corps.Four of the five  gaps  in  the  rails were repaired within  twenty-four hours and a relief  train  got through  to Muadhdharn  fromthe north ; the fifth break, between Muadhdham and Khishm  Sanastations,  which Lieutenant Garland had himself effected, remainedopen longer.  The Muadhdham fort is  the old stonebuilt pilgrimqalah ; but the  Turks had constructed also out of rocks a pyra-midal gun-emplacement of considerable strength.   They numberedabout 200, and except  for a small  guard left in the fort,  all  tookup positions at once in prepared  trenches.  It  seems they  hadbeen expecting the attack and had got two mountain-guns intoposition.    Before the attack  took place, Colonel Newcornbe and a party of Ageyl and  Bishawa went north of Muadhdham station to cut the railway and telegraph  lines.   From Colonel  NewcombeVreport  it is seen that he had considerable difficulty in getting theparties with him  to attend to  any orders.   However, finally hebegan blowing up the line at kilo. 798, and  although about  160charges were fired, he reports  very little real damage was done tothe line.    He then moved south to Dizad, where there  were some dozenTurks  in a fort.  Nobody  could be persuaded  to  take on the attack  of this fort,  the fall  of  which could have been easilyaccomplished if his men had done what they were told.  However,they preferred the less dangerous work of blowing  up  the  line,and, when he  found them again, were at kilo.  809 on demolitionwork.  Between  kilos. 809 and 814, the  telegraph  line  was cuttwice  between poles, and he estimated  that,  on the  whole, fiftyrails were damaged at kilo. 798, and the telegraph line was cut inone place, and about twenty rails and the  telegraph line were cutfor four  kilometres between kilos.  809 and 814.    The chief point in Colonel Newcombe&apos;s report emphasizes the extraordinary  lack of discipline shown by the untrained Bedouin,and their total disregard  of any  orders, even  a  Sheriffs, and thegood  work,  under very  trying  conditions, of   the disciplinedtroops.   Transport and commissariat  arrangements he reports aspoor.    Sherif Feisal is still at Wejh, but practically all his availablemen and guns  are  operating on the railway   line.  Abdullahremains  in  Wadi  Ais,  and   reports  that  he  is  cutting therailway nightly.   Ali and Zeid are reported to  have abandonedtheir siege of  Bir el-Mashi.  Ali has taken up  positions on theSultani road and near Muheit station to operate against the railway.Zeid remains  to watch Bir el-Mashi.
                 Information from  Prisoners.     Reports  from  prisoners  recently captured  give a certainamount of information  about  the  Hejaz  Railway ;  but theirstatements about  the  number  of   trains  running  are  very doubtful, in view of  the known shortage of engines.     There are  reported to be thirty-five regular  soldiers at AbuTaka, which is defended by three small blockhouses, holding nineto ten men each.  The garrison of Medain Salih is reported tobe about 400, under Mustafa Munir Eff.    Medain Salih is alsoprotected  by blockhouses.   A  gun-pit was reported at MedainSalih,  but  no gun had been seen.  One prisoner stated that  theonly  stations on the line which  have a water supply, betweenMedain Salih and Tebuk, are el-Muadbdham and Qalat el-Akhclar.     Prisoners reported that,  up till  the end of  March, two orthree trains passed, each way (videnote at the beginning).  Trainsfrom  Medina were  full of  civilian  inhabitants  and a certainamount of soldiers,  but in no sense  could be called troop-trains.Trains from the north  bring rations, most of which are reportedto be for the Arabs, and  particularly for  Ibn Rashid.  SheikhShehab of  the Fuqara and Sheikh Suleiman Rufadah  Pasha arealso known to receive rations.   Trains sometimes had armouredtrucks,  but apparently  very few trains  were supplied with  an escort.  At one time there was a big reserve of rails at Toweira,but  latterly  these have been moved north  to  Tebuk,  whence,it was believed, a light line was contemplated to Uweini, in order-to bring fuel.   An engine was also reported to have  run off  theline and been destroyed during the recent rains.     Information about aeroplanes was vague.  An aerodrome  was reported to have been prepared at Medain Salih, but no machines had been  sent,  though some new ones were expected from  thenorth.
Yemen. The Tribes, the Imam, etc.     The following Note,  written by Lieut.-Colonel H. F. Jacob, Assistant  Resident, under  date  March  19,  is  reproduced  by permission of the Resident, Aden.  Original letters to and from idrisi, etc., accompanied the Mote :      &quot;An original letter has been brought to Aden written by the Governor-Genera! of the Yemen to Sheikh  Hizam  (Nizam ?) Pasha ibn Abdallah el-Sar.  [See  Arab Bulletin  No.  40, p. 51.1 It is dated November 6, 1916. in reply  to one,  from rlizam of date March  1.4, 1916.     &quot; The subject-matter goes back to what occurred one year ago, but  discloses  jealousy and  ill-feeling in  the.  ranks of the Bekil tribesmen.   This Sheikh Hizam el-Sar,  was created Pasha by the Turks.   He is  considered  even  now  the principal  Sheikh. of Amran, one of.  the Bekil septs.   He  is  aggrieved  because his rival, Nakib Abdallah ibn Mansur el-Amaisa  (Bekil), has  beenmade Governor of the province  of  Amran over  his  head.   Heenquires  of  the  Governor-General whose   appointment  this was, whether the Turks&apos; or the Imam&apos;s, and the Governor-Generalreplies that the two  authorities are  indisseverabiy united, and form a solid phalanx, in defence of Islam,  against  all enemies.     &quot; This  move  on  the part of the  Governor-General  was evidently  made to sow  dissension  in  the Bekil  ranks.  El-Sar was perhaps courting the  Idrisi.   An allusion is made by el-Sar to the Hashid tribe, but what exactly was  alluded to is not stated. The Governor-General  tells  the  addressee that  the  Hashid are honourable men and submissive  in all things  to  the  Turks and to the Imam &apos;a very proper allegiance  due  from a  Zeidi clan.&apos; The Governor-General warns el-Sar  not  to criticise the Hashid, for this amounts to a criticism of the Sublime Government, and he  assures  him that the Hashid  wiU plump for the Turkish Government.    Finally,   the    Governor-General   defends   the collection of tithes, by the Imam, to which el-Sar  had  apparently taken exception, on the ground that they  were &quot;graft.&quot; destined for others&apos;  pockets.     &quot; The  above correspondence fell into the hands of Seyyid Yahya  ibn  Abdul  Rahman at Jizan.   This  is the Seyyid  who came from  Jeddah with  the  Sherifian envoy  &apos; Sheikh  el-Sada.&apos; The fact proves  that el-Sar,  or bis emissary, must  have  comedown there to try  his luck with  Idrisi.    &quot; The  Hashid wa Bekil  are  pure mercenaries, who swarm to the standard of the biggest briber.  They are fickle to a degree.It is a common practice for sept to leave sept  and join  the  man with the largest purse.  It is hardly possible for one man to enlist the Hashid  wa Bekil  in  their entirety.    These  tribesmen  were originally  in the pay of the Imam, who,  being stingy, got Izzet Pasha, when Turkey was fighting Italy,  to  pay  not only  his ^the Imam&apos;s)  stipend, but  that of these refractor)&apos;  tribesmen
 of his.   Some of the Hashid wa Bekil dissapproved of the Imam&apos;s wooing the  Turks,  and  left him  to start an intrigue  with  the anti-Turk  Idrisi.    Nasir Mabkhut  el-Ahmar was  one of  the leading  Hashid who  wrote  to Idrisi,  and quite recently Seyyid Yahya,  who was  in Jizan,  reported that Haj Masud  el-Bariki (Hashid),  together  with,   (of  the  Bekil),  Salih   Dugheish, principal Sheikh of the Beni Harith. and  Sheikh Ibrahim ibn  Ali of Rauda,  were in Jizan,  plotting to win  Idrisi&apos;s support;.     &quot;To complicate matters still  further,  this  Seyyid Yahya carried  certain  proposals from   the  King of  the  Hejaz to  the Hashid wa  Bekil, and was able to secure letters from various sheikhs  of  the Hashid  wa Bekil, in  which  they  offer  their services  to King  Husein.   The avowed  object  is  to  oust  the Turks, but  the conditions formulated include money, arms and ammunition, and various  other important details of requirements, now  and  after  the war.   The principal  signatories  are  Ali Husein el-Bariki,  Ahmed tbu Yahya ibn  Fara, Ali  ibn Mukbil Abu  Said,  Haj Masnd ibn  Aid el-Bariki,  all of Hashid,  and various Bekil Sheikhs.     &quot; Idrisi  has sent to our  Resident an original letter to himself from the Bekil Sheikh, Yahya ibn Yahya el-Shaif.   This Sheikh is of importance and lives at Zahir.  His daughter was  given in marriage to the Hashid Sheikh, Ahmed Yahya Fara.   The  letter proves the writer to be a  prime braggart.     &quot;There  is, theu, utter chaos reigning, since  three  principal rulers, the  Imam,  fdrisi and the King of the Hejaz are trying their hardest to win  over  these mercenaries, who, if united, form the  &apos; creme  de la.  creme &apos;  of  the warriors  of  Yemen ;   but. divided  they   will   effect  practically   nothing just   energy dissipated.     &quot; It is very important  for  us to gain the adherence of  the fiuani  Yahya to our cause.  This  the Idrisi  would checkmate, for he does not wish his rival to come  within the purview of our friendship, lest his  own  claims south  of Loheiya, which  are very  nebulous, go by the board.   He claims the territories held in 1848  by  Sherif  Husein  of  Abu Arish,  and these  included tracts as far south as Mokha.     &quot;It  stands to reason, with all this wire-pulling, that idrisis chances of  enlisting the Hashid wa Bekil to any appreciable, or useful  extent, are very small; and therefore  our  offer  through him  to  the Hashid  wa Bakil of  7,000 per mensem for 5,000 warriors  would  be   so  much  money  thrown  into the  sea ; especially since the  latest  conditions  formulated  by  el-Shaif (Bekil)  to the  Idrisi are so grasping and so far in excess  of what  this  Residency recommended,  and  the  Government  hassanctioned.     &quot;There  was in my opinion  an initial  error committed  in tampering  with the  Hashid wa  Bekil ;  for  manifestly we can have no control over them  once  they  enter  the.  field, nor could we  guarantee their  steering clear of the  Imam Yahya, even if
the latter held aloof, as he has up to date.   Nothing easier forIdrisi than to assert an overt act  of  hostility by the Imam, andas difficult for us to disprove it at this distance.  It is the Imamwho, after this &quot;war, will be our strongest potential  foe, or friend.and to attempt  to  wean away his tribesmen will not, I believe,result in getting him off bis perch with the Turks.   If he didcome  in  for  us  and found  the Hashid  wa Bekil alienated, with what  troops  would he take the field ?   Again, if  he sees  Idrisitrying to win over  the  Hashid wa Bekil, he will  at once suspectBritish agency and give us  the cold shoulder straight awav.    &quot; On the top of all this, as  1 have said above, we see  theedifying  spectacle of Seyyicl Yahya intriguing on  behalf of  theKing  of  the Hejaz !   This  Yahya did  not receive  a kindlywelcome  from  Idrisi.  who  rightly  scented  self-interest   inYahya&apos;s  plans  and  vetoed his proposal to  go  inland.  Yahyaaccordingly  plotted,  and  got   letters  from  certain   Hashidwa Bekil  Sheikhs, over IdrisTs  head  and  unknown  to  Idrisi.ldrisi, so far as this Residency is  aware, has not discovered thiscounter-plotting.  If he did so, his  relations with Aden  wouldbe less cordial,  since Yahya travelled up to Jizan from Aden andwould be considered  partly  our spokesman, or acting with  ourapproval.    &quot;As regards the  Hashid tribesmen, it  will  not be easy forIdrisi to  secure them.   Nasir Nabkhut has influence, but noArab  sheikh  can command more than a nominal allegiance fromhis tribesmen.   Sheharah, the  Imam&apos;s chief residence, is situated in the midst of Hashid territory,  and here the Imam&apos;s influenceis paramount, whatever Nasir may say to the contrary.  Nasir isa   weathercock,  and   will  desert  Idrisi  when  he  finds itconvenient to draw more from another source.  It is unreasonable to blame the Imam, as Idrisi did, when he stated that despite histreaty with  the Turks, it was  easy for the Imam to break hispledge, and  Allah  would  provide an  opening !   The Imam, ishonourable, as  Arabs go, and  again, his interests  tell him that,removed as  be is  far  inland,  it is a very precarious venture for him to oppose  the Turks,  except covertly ; whereas Idrisi, whofor some time past has been anti-Turk, lives near  the sea-hoard.and, if attacked, can  rely  on  British  warships  to defend him.These  two rulers  are placed in  very different situations.    Mysympathies  go  rather  with  the   Imam,  whose   forbears  havestoutly disputed with the Turks the mastery of the Yemen.    &quot; The wording  of the  Residents letter  to  Idrisi,  whileeliminating every  possible  occasion for  Idrisi&apos;s charging us witha change of policy,  will force him  to  reconsider the recruiting ofthese  Hashid wa Bekil in all its bearings, and will  throwr on him the onus  of  securing them  on   the  conditions  allowed  by government.    &quot; In the meantime there remains a slight hope of our securingthe Imam&apos;s entrance  into  the  field.    Little will  be  gained by
re-approaching hi.ni, it lie declines to accept the present invitation ;but if he elects still to hold aioof, his sitting on the fence is not without its advantages, though these are secondary.   If,  then,the Idrisi cannot enlist those  mercenaries, we  shall  not only be saved  a  useless  expenditure  of cash,  but  shall  be spared thespectacle  of  a congeries  of tribesmen  split  up  into differentcamps, allured by varying offers, and presenting no solid oppositionto the  Turks.     &quot; Sheikh Ahmed  Musa id-Allaui,  of Sabab, is at  heart aZeidi and  pro-Imam.   He  carried our  last  letters  to the Imamand  brought a  reply, and  the   letter  from  El-Dumein.    Iemployed  this Sheikh largely from  1904-1907, and here, in aden,  since  1910.   He  is a  &apos; trimmer.&apos; hut at  this junctureanxious to oust  the  Turks.    His report, brought back  fromSudah, the Imam&apos;s present residence, shows  that the  Imam atheart does  see  occasion  to break away from  the  Turks.  El-Duuiein is one of the best of the [uiam&apos;s lieutenants.  He visitedAden before  the war and carried verbal  messages from the Sherifof Mecca to the Imam.  He will be able, if plied with a suitabledouceur,  to influence  the Imam, and we can  further play on theavarice of Abdallah ibn Ibrahim, the Imam&apos;s confidant  and chief minister-.   Both men  will  expect presents ; for the Arab lives upto his  saw regarding  the  omnipotence  of  cash, which is  &quot;thetongue of the eloquent and  the strong arm of the fighter.&quot;     &quot; If  we  can  secure the linam Yahya, we shall put Idrisi  inhis proper place, and  secure  ourselves  from much acrimoniouseorrespondence and serious trouble  with  the Imam if the Turksleave the   Yemen and further, damage very  greatly  in the yemen  the prestige of the Turks, who, if  the Imam  seceded,would have their retreat cut off.     &quot; We  need not,  however,  expect  to see  any  two  Arabianchiefs co-operating against the Turks.   They will  never do morethan play each for himself.  We shall  never enjoy  the spectacleof &apos; the two kings smelling  at one nosegay.&apos;  Our  diplomacywill  be  successful, if   we  can  induce each  to  move on his ownterritory for  a common object.     &quot; Another letter from  Idrisi is  just to hand.  He wants theHashid  wa Bakil to  raid  the  Tihamah down to  Sheikh  Said,where he asserts  naively that the  Imam Yahya has no interests.He admits that  the demands  of the  Hashid  wa Bakil  will be high.  He does not much  care if these tribesmen  are enlisted ornot,  so  far  as his  own territories  are  concerned, but says theywould prove very useful for the broader objective.   He does notappear to have  so  far offered  any  monetary  conditions to theHashid wa Bakil.     &quot; One point has  not  been adequately considered heretofore.I refer to the very easy transfusion of. prejudices between  Shalland  Zeicli  creeds  in  the  Yemen.   Many  of our  hinterlandproteges lean, towards  the Imam, and more so since the expulsionof the Turks from the Yemen is now practicable.&quot;
                       ABYSSINIA.                       Somali  Frontier.     The Commissioner for British  Somaliland, who went up toAdis Abeba to attend the coronation, took occasion to draw theattention of Ras Taffari and the Government to  the unsatisfactory state of the districts lying between  our Somaliland protectorate and  the Abyssinian  frontier.&apos;   The  old-standing  difficulty  of administering these provinces  has been aggravated lately by chaosin the  Harrar Province and Lij  Yasu&apos;s  Moslem intrigues.  TheCommissioner writes:      &quot; With an  administrative post at.  Hargeisa we control  theSomali tribes right up to  the  frontier, and they are to-day well-ordered and peaceable.   But across the border,  in the Abyssiniansphere, there is neither control nor security of life and property.Were  we able to confine our  people  within our territory,  thesolution would lie in our own hands.  We could establish tribalposts, as we have done with  a good measure of  success  on  thedervish  front,  and  thus  preserve  the  British  tribes fromaggression  from  outside.   But our  frontier  with  Abyssinia,which  runs through the  middle  of the Somali country, leavesus  without adequate  water  and  grazing.   To both  peoples,certainly, the right of free grazing on  either side of the border ispreserved ;  but, in practice,  the situation  resolves  itself  intothis : that  whole sections of our tribes have to emigrate into the abyssinian sphere and live there with their flocks  and herds for six months in the year in pursuit of water and  pasturage ; while there is  no neceseity for the Abyssinian  Somali tribes to comeinto our territory at all, except for purposes  of trade, and whenthey will.   In the absence of any  control on  the  other  side ofthe line  it follows that, when our  people are  looted (and  theyfrequently  are), there  is  no  redress obtainable  except by meansof reprisals : and if raiding and counter-raiding are allowed to run  their  course, they can  only, in  the end,  lead to completedisorder and anarchy along the whole  frontier.&quot;     The Commissioner goes on to point out  how the AbyssinianGovernment  has  failed  to  fulfil   its  treaty  obligations  to administer  and  deal fairly with  these Somalis, there not being-one Abyssinian officer or soldier now in all the  Ogaden territory.Massacres  of  Moslems by Abyssinian  soldiery  in the  HarrarProvince have embittered these Somalis,  who  now pray  for thereturn of Lij Yasu.   The latter, the Commissioner  thinks, might possibly kindle a great blaze  in  all  the  country from the  Gulf of aden to Juba.   Meanwhile, no steps are being  taken to  capturehim.     The Commissioner arrived at no  satisfactory understandingat Adis Abeda,
-  201  -229                          NOTES. Basin of Lower Wadi Hamdh.     Captain L. Royle, M.G.,  whose competence in Arabic, and&quot;power- Of gaining Bedouin confidence are well  known, spent somedays  in  the country behind  Wejh  in March  last.   Pie was senttip to search for landing grounds for the R.F.C., and Went as farin as  Jeyadah. on  the southern el-Ala road,  and TJgia (Akila) onthe Medina  road.  He reports, that,  though there is scarcity ofaccessible and good water, the country in general is surprisinglywell-wooded, and full of game.  In the wadis are guinea-fowl andred-legged partridge ; the true ring-dove is common, and so is the blue rock-pigeon.  Dorcas and  Loder&apos;s gazelle were seen, as well asibex,  hyaena, and a small jackal.  Captain Royle came on  tracksof a. leopard, and heard much of an animal, probably a wolf orwild dog, which will attack a camel alone and pull it down.  the k.F.C. observers estimate  the  hills, two  day&apos;s journey  inlandfrom  Wejh  (e.g. Jebel s Gbalab and  Warid), to rise  to 5,000 feet,and the railway to be more distant from  tbe coast than our mapsrepresent it.  (Lieut. Garland, on the other hand,  thought it, atToweira, about twenty miles nearer to the coast than  it is charted.&quot;)Jeyadah  is  reckoned  by Bedouins half-way  between Bir AbuAjaj  and the railway ; el-Ala is reached, according to  them inone and  a half day&apos;s easy  going from Jeyadah.   At his firstnight halt on  (he outgoing-journey from  Wejh, between  WadiMiya and  Seil  Abu  Ajaj,. Captain  Royle  found  the rifle-pitsmade by  the   Emden &quot; party  on  their march up to  el-Ala inMay 1915. Currency in Jiddah.     Mr. L. G.  Roussin; of the Ministry of Finance, Cairo, kindlycommunicates notes of a conversation  with Mr. Georges  Raad.Controller of the Imperial, Ottoman  Bank, Jiddah Branch.   Themost  interesting  item  of  information concerns Turkish  silvermoney,  which.  Mr. Raad says has not depreciated  at  the same rate as gold.  A mejidieh now  exchanges for 16*6  gold piastres,a  depreciation  of only about  10 per cent on   the pre-war  rate:but small currency,  which  is  plentiful  enough, has fallen about 10 per cent more than the large silver.   Xo Turkish notes are in circulation in Jiddah, but  Egyptian notes  are accepted at about2J- per  cent discount.  Merchants  generally  contrive to  makeabout &apos;1\ per cent between  the rates at which  they receive and pay  out money.  When  the mejidieh was fixed  by the HejazGovernment at an arbitrary rate of 17 piastres, they  paid theirdues  in  this coin ; subsequently the  rate was lowered  to 16 piastres, and it paid them better to settle in gold. &apos;*;   Rupees circulate at about the same discount as in  India, i.e. vou may get up to  16J rupees for  the pound  sterling.  Owing to the number  of counterfeit  mejidiehs in  circulation, containing often  as  much  silver  as  the  genuine   coins,  the   Hejaz
Government  has declared that all those &quot; closely  resembling &quot;the real article are to be accepted as currency.Aden Hinterland.     Under date  April 9, Aden sends reports which  indicate  thatthe revolt on the Yusufyin frontier,  extending south-west fromTaiz for some forty miles, has given, and  is giving,  Ali  SaidPasha a good deal of trouble.  In one fight the Turks are said tohave  had some thirty  casualties; and  by sending. successivedetachments  northwards,  they  have  almost denuded  Lahej  oftroops.  Gun and rifle ammunition has also  heen sent north  inconsiderable quantities.     This Yusufyin  revolt has now been going on  for some twomonths.   The main combatants are tribal;  but the Turks  havebeen helping Nasir  Muqbil and his Hajariyah and Jebel Habashilevies.   The  Yusufyin have now asked for monetary assistancefrom us to enable them to continue  in the field, and  a certain .grant has  been made by Aden.   We are not, however, at presenttrying to organize a wider-spread revolt, owing to  difficulties  ofcommunicatiojt   with more distant tribes,  and  the expediency of leaving negotiations with some of these, e.g. the  Bekii, in thehands of Idrisi.  But several chiefs appear to be out against theTurks,  e.g.  Kaid  Rajeb of  Baadan,  who  lias&apos;sent his  brotherHassan with 500  men to help Hassan  Kaid Abu Ras of theKhaulan et-Tawal tribe, and  Seyyid  Ahmed of Taiz.  We  hearalso of another  chief, Hassan Mohammed el-Dueis,  as an ally  ofKaid Rajeb ; he claims to have been supplied with   ammunitionby the Imam Yahya.Yemen.     Money is getting scarce in the Ottoman Treasury  at Sanaa,if  a report sent by the  Abdali Sultan&apos;s confidential correspondentat  Lahej  be true,  to  the effect that the  Vali has warned AliSaid Pasha,  of  his  inability  to send him  any  more  cash forsalaries, etc.   Those at  Lahej, said  the Vali, must henceforthiive off the country.     A chief of the Khaulan et-Tawal has reported  to Aden thatthe people of Yemen are  displeased  with the  Turks,  and  prayGod they be removed.                -.....  .Afghan Opinion and Baghdad.                    . ;         .;     In Kabul,  we  are  informed, the news of Baghdad  wasreceived very quickly, and the  bazaars explained it by  a storythat the Turks  had been  drawn  away  to  Kerbela by  a  feint.leaving Baghdad to be occupied without opposition. (The  samebazaar  credited  Enver with  the deposition of the Tzar !)   Atthe same  time   the  news  is said to have  scotched the Turco-German party at Kabul, and to have  caused deep  depression  inthe higher circles.   The Amir betook himself to  Laghinan  with it  is said, the pick of his harem ladies, to  obtain relief from
pessimistic  talk  in  the capital.. occasioned  by a  sense of themilitary and political weakness and the. general  backwardness ofthe Moslem world.Ibn Rashid and the  Hard.    In the recent fighting  between Ibn  Rashid and  the  BeniSalim  Harb, who  belong  to  Abdullah&apos;s force,  we  are  informedfrom Mecca that Ibn Rashid. who was ;the  aggressor, lost  200mares, and that two of  the principal  Abdah  Sheikhs, Aqab ibn-Ajil (grand-uncle of Ibn Rashid) and Ibn  Nahaiyir (?),  were killed.   An Ajmau chief  is  also reported killed, but his namehas so  suffered in transmission that we  do not know  whether heis one of the Hithleins or not.  His individual name was perhapsMutluq.
