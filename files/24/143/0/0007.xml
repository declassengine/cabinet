     One matter of administration is important; that native officials should be paid ona higher scale than in the Basra district.  Egyptian rates of pay are. much fairer thanthose of India, and it is particularly important, if an efficient native service is to be started, that the rates should be adequate.     Living in Baghdad is normally on a much  higher plane than in Indian centres,owing to price of labour and the lack of domestic servants.     If it can possibly be avoided, natives of  India, Eurasians  and others should not beemployed in Baghdad except for distinctly British service.     The  police  should  be  very highly  paid so  long as  we  are  in  direct control.Parsimony in  this  direction  will  be exceedingly  dangerous.   The smartness  and authority of  the police are a matter of great moment.  The Egyptian  police alwaysimpress Arab  travellers  in  Egypt by their cleanliness, discipline, and civilised aspect;it is  suggested that if any  British chief police  officers are required, either london or Cairo should provide them.   The Baghdad people are by now  accustomed to a police to which the C.TJ.P. has devoted considerable- attention, and, in  consequence, it  shouldnot be replaced by anything which is likely to appear Oriental or shabbjr in comparison.                                      HEJAZ.     The operations in Hejaz continue to follow a  satisfactory course.  The destructionof the railway,  under  Colonel  Newcombe&apos;s supervision, was a  perilous  undertaking,crowned with  great success.         THE ITALIAN  PROPOSAL IN REGARD  TO  SENDING TROOPS TO HEJAZ.     This move should be noted.                                      IDHISI.     The German account of the situation in Western Arabia is interesting; the referenceto Idrisi is interesting in view of his  consistent apathy as regards the Turkish garrisons in his area.                                      SYRIA.     The state of affairs in Syria is very bad.  In  event of an  advance  into Palestinebeing contemplated, or a possible successful rising which would open the ports, it wouldbe well to be prepared with supplies with which to mitigate the people&apos;s sufferings.                                 INDIAN SEDITION.     Particular attention is drawn to  the account of the seditious expressions of opinionreported as being uttered by Indian  students at Oxford University.  If this report isan  index  of what  is actually  current  conversation, it would  appear to  indicate adeplorable state of affairs which  might be improved by judicious  counter-propaganda.Profound hostility to this country seems to be the overwhelming  motive ;  neither Islamnor Arab independence appear to be considered ;  and it  tends to confirm the opinion ofthose who believe that Indian pro-Turkism has its real roots  in hatred of Great Britainand not in religious sentiment.                               RUSSIAN TURKESTAN.     This Afghan invitation to Turkomans to emigrate to  Afghanistan may have itsorigin in the Pan-Turanian policy of the Turkish agents now in Afghanistan.

The Arab Bureau telegraphed on the 7th March [A.B. 911] that the first aeroplanereconnaissance of the environs of Medina was  made on the  5th March with the consentof Ali.   Bir Mashi and Bir  Derwish were strongly held ; one train  was  in  Medinastation ;  there was an  aerodrome at Medina with four  hangars;   and  three enemy machines were sighted in the  air.   It  also telegraphed  on the same day [A.B. 909]       [898-34]                                                               B
saying that a report from Wej dated the 1st  March stated that on the 22nd February500 camels carrying rice, sugar, and cloth arrived at El Ula, having been brought byan agent  of Ibn Rashid  from  Nejef.   It was also reported that a mounted force waspatrolling between Medain Saleh and El Ula.   Four  battalions of infantry had arrivedat El Ulu, where Basri Pasha was.     It telegraphed again on the 12th March [A.B. 961] saying that Colonel Newcombehad  reported  the destruction of 350 rails  between Dar-el-Hamra  [262 miles fromMedina] and Moadham [33 miles N.W. of Dar-el-Hamra] and also of two, perhaps four,locomotives.   He estimated that the damage  could  not  be repaired before the 20thMarch.   Sixteen prisoners were taken,  among  them  being the representative of IbnRashid.  The  flight of aeroplanes is to be transferred from Rabegh to Wej to operate against the railway.                             Ottoman  Bank at Jeddah.     The Foreign Office  telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate on the 10th March [No. 253]instructing him that he might intimate  discreetly to King Hussain that we should not object if he closed the Ottoman bank at Jeddah.  It would probably be best for the king to refuse to allow any banking business in Jeddah for the present.                       Visit of a French Political I Economist.     Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the  9th March [No. 247] that M. Belet would arriveat Port Said  shortly on  the way to Jedciah ;  the French Minister had informed him that M. Belet  was a political economist.          .  Proposal that- Italian Troops should participate in Operations.     The Italian  Ambassador communicated a note on the 28th February proposing&quot; to add Italian representation to  the military participation of the Allies.&quot;  The proposedrepresentation would consist of &apos;: a company  of Eritrean Mohammedan  Ascari com-manded by a captain and two  subalterns, with two Italian soldiers.&quot;  A copy of the note  was  transmitted  to the War Office, and in the covering letter Sir Ronald Grahamsaid that Mr.  Baifour considered it  essential  that  the proposal should be refused, but before doing so he wished to know the  exact numbers and  status of the  English andFrench forces  in Hejaz.Asm.                            The Agreement with Idrisi.     Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed on the 8th  March  that  His Majesty&apos;s  Governmentconcurred that in the  circumstances  the agreement might be ratified ; but it did not like it, and hoped that at the  close of the war  an  opportunity might be afforded of putting our relations with Idrisi on a more satisfactory footing.ADEN.                             The Ahyan Trade Route.     The G.O.C. telegraphed on the 13th March  [No. 447] that  attempts were beingmade to close the Abyan trade  route;  there  were two successful raids  by  Turks oncaravans durine: the. preceding week.              O      1       OMISCELLANEOUS.                A German View of the Situation in Western Arabia.     The following  appeared in  the &quot; Osmanischer  Lloyd&quot;  (Constantinople) of the20th February :          &quot; According to  information  received by  the  department  dealing with such     matters,  the  Imam  Yahia  denounces and  diapproves the  attitude  adopted by     Hussein,  late Emir of Mecca, who,, in collusion with the English, revolted  against     the Ottoman Government.   Imam Yahia, in  any event, would lend his assistance,     and spares no efforts in order to guarantee the needs of the local population.   By     the acts  of humanity shown by him&apos;towards  the population, Yahia has proved his     attachment to the Khalifat and to the Imperial Government.  He has stated     that  even if he had only a piece of bread  he  would have shared  it with the     Government.
           &quot; The English have made attacks from time to time on the Aden front, but       each time they have been defeated and thrown back on their defences.           &quot; The tribes of Issa, Mihlaf, Beni-Nechir, and Beni-Eslem,  which make up the       principal forces of  Idrisi, have  made their submission to the Government.   The       other tribes have also commenced to follow the example, with the result that Idrisi       has lost all his influence.  The  plans of the English have thus failed, and they can       no longer count on the  help of Idrisi.  Neither  can they find further  men on       account of lack of funds.           &quot; Favourable rains have fallen this year in the Yemen country, with the result       that the crops have much benefited thereby ; prices have fallen by one-half, and a       further drop in prices is expected.           &quot; In general, the situation  of this country is favourable.&quot;,                 &apos;                                       SYRIA.                                 Internal Conditions.       The following report has been received: The  condition  of  Syria is pitiful.   One-  fifth of the population has died of hunger, misery, and disease during the war.   In the  Lebanon alone from 150,000  to 160,000 have died.       Jemel  Pasha continues the reign  of terror.   Throughout Syria there are daily  hangings of people, condemned either  for their  relations during peace time with the  French consul, or, as an  example, to  terrorise the population.  The latter, Christian and  Moslem alike, look earnestly for the day of freedom.  The Moslems are more anxious  than the Christians since the hanging at Damascus of the son of  Abd-el-Kadar.   In  the mosques they already pray for King Hussain&apos;3 victory over the Turks.                                 MESOPOTAMIA.                                Capture of Baghdad.       The force under Sir Stanley Maude took Baghdad early in the morning of Sunday,  the 1 l.th March.                             Administration of Baghdad.       On the  12th March Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the Viceroy that His Majesty&apos;s  Government was not prepared to approve the extension of direct British administration  to the vilayet of Baghdad.  The predominant considerations must  be  political rather  than administrative till the  war was over and the  whole set of problems connected with  the future   of the Arab world had  been  cleared up.   The existing  administrative  machinery must be preserved  as far as  possible  for the present, Arab  spirit and  personnel being substituted for  Turkish.   While,  therefore, the vilayet  should  remain  under martial law for the security of the occupying force, British officials should not be  multiplied unnecessarily.                                 Persian Interests.-      Sir  C. Marling telegraphed on the 14th March [No, 102] that the Persian Govern-  ment had expressed  a  confident hope that all  necessary steps would be taken by the^British authorities to protect the  Persian holy  places in Mesopotamia and  Persian  subjects residing there.                                      EGYPT.                          Wireless System Darfur-Abesher.      On  the  24th February  Sir  R. Wingate asked  [telegram 190] whether he  was to  refuse  communication with Abesher  [Arabian Report,  N.S.,  II,   p. 4, and Eastern  Report, IV, p. 3] until an application had been received from the French Government;  and on the 7th March the  Foreign  Office informed him [telegram  231] that the  War  Office desired that until  a formal application had been received from the French Govern-  ment no arrangements should be made for  a regular wireless with Abesher.                                    ABYSSINIA.                                The Jibuti Railway.      In regard to the rumoured application for a prolongation of this railway westward  [Eastern  Report, V,  p.  3],  Lord Bertie  telegraphed  on  the 2nd  March  [No. 168j        [898-34]                                                       B  2
that (1) he had been informed by the President of the Council that no such proposal had been  communicated to  him; and (2). that M. Jules Cambon had no knowledge ofany such scheme.                                 The Aeroplanes.    Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Mr. Thesiger on the 10th March [No. 22] in regard tothe two  aeroplanes  which were to  be lent  to  the Abyssinian Government [EasternReport, III, 3] that the original intention was that they were to be used for demonstra-tion  purposes.   The proposal to employ them for bombing Magdala [Eastern Report,IV, S] far exceeded the original object, and aeroplanes with British personnel could notbe allowed  to  be used on  military operations  connected with  the  internal affairs of abyssinia.  The  two aeroplanes were ready for shipment from  Egypt, and could besent  for  purposes of demonstration  only.  Did. Mr. Thesiger wish  them&apos; to proceed ?Mr. Balfour also said  that  the  War Office had stated that for fighting purposes twomachines would be  valueless a flight would be required with suitable personnel, motorlorries, &amp;c. ; and  so large a detachment could not be granted.    On the same day Mr. Thesiger sent a telegram [No. 22], which crossed Mr. Balfours.He said that the crux of the situation was Magdala, and that Ras Taffari must, withoutdelay, finish with Lij Yasu.   With  this view his Italian colleague agreed.  Ras Taffarimust  be supported, as if he  fell general anarchy  would follow; and Magdala  could notbe taken without aeroplanes.                               Jibuti ATUIS Traffic    The Foreign Office telegraphed to  Sir  R.  Wingate on the 8th March [No. 235],informing him  that the Italian Government had.suggested that the existing stock  ofarms  at  Jibuti might  be purchased by  the Allied  Governments  to prevent furtherexports to Abyssinia.   Sir  11.  Wingate  replied on  the 10th March  [No. 252] thatthe Italian suggestion seemed to be advantageous, but that he could not advise  as tothe disposal of  the rifles and ammunition in the absence of exact information in regardto them.                  Suggested Present  of Arms by French Government.    The Foreign Office telegraphed to  Sir  R.  Rodd on the 28th February [No. 421]asking him to inform the Italian Government that the French Government had askedwhether His  Majesty&apos;s Government had  any objection to their giving the  Empressof Abyssinia two guns as a  coronation gift.   Sir R.  B,odd replied on the 6th March[No.  194J that the Italian  Government, in view of the principle agreed upon that noarms  should be imported into Abyssinia, did  not favour the bestowal of such gifts; andfurther action of this  kind  taken  by one Power without previous consultation with itsallies was contrary to the accepted principle of  a united front on the part of the three powers towards the Abyssinian  Government.                                 THE  SENUSSI.                               The Italian Prisoners.    Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on  the  7th March [No. 238] that Colonel Talbot had stated (1) in a  letter dated the 26th February that  the Italians had agreed to rationthe force  which  Mohammed Idris would  despatch to intercept Ahmed and preventinterference with the  prisoners.  This force  would be  under  Said Riad ; and (2), in atelegram of the 5th March, that Riad would not go east of Hekeim, where the &quot; Tara &quot;prisoners  were.  Sir R.  Wingate telegraphed  again on the  9th March [No. 243 A],in response to an  enquiry  from the  Italian Government, that Colonel  Talbot had telegraphed on the 8th March that there was no information of the prisoners havingstarted&apos; for the  coast, but it  was  believed  that they  had  done  so.  It  was notanticipated that  Ahmed would be able to intercept them.                         Anglo-Franco-Italian Agreement.    The  French Government has acceded to the Anglo-Italian agreement for actionagainst the Senussi.
1                                   PERSIA.i                       South Persian Rifles for Eastern Persia.      Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 26th  February in regard to  the importance of having  an organised  force ready to take control  in  Eastern Persia  when the Indian troops were withdrawn, saying that this pointed to  the desirability of  extending, at an early date, the organisation of the South  Persian  Rifles to Eastern  Persia.   On  the 5th March Sir C. Marling^ telegraphed to the Foreign  Office [No. 90]  saying that the proposed force  in Eastern Persia should be under the  same command  as the South  Persian Rifles for  the following reasons: (1) Experience had shown that  gendarmerie  could not be  employed in the districts  in which they had  been recruited,  being too much open to local influence, and therefore it would be better  to have a single  command to facilitate transfers from  one province to another ; (2) the Persian Govern-  ment would  only  recognise one  command;  and  (3) the Seistan  contingent  would  eventually be incorporated in the South Persian Rifles.                                  Soulet-ecl-Dowleh.      After consultation with the India Office, Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir C. Maiding  on  the  10th March [No. 76], saying that the consensus of opinion was that it was  impossible to trust Soulefs promises  on  account of his record of treachery.  But, as he  (Mr. Balfour) realised the opportuneness of the present moment for action by Persians, he  was prepared to entertain the proposal which had been  made by Farman Farma that  Soulet should be paid by results.  If this were feasible, and if Sir  C.  Marling  could  make the arrangement  lie had suggested with  Daria be given, the  experiment would be  worth trying.  Soulet would be paid, through  Farman Farma according to results up  to a maximum of  30,000 tomans [1 toman = Si1.] for  three months ; but he  would  receive  no munitions from us.   If Sir C. Marling were  satisfied he might  act  imme-  diately.   [See Arabian Report, N..S., IV, p.  6, and Eastern Report, VI, p. 5.]                                  Sir Percy Sykes.      Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the  20th February [No. 71] that he had asked the  Persian Government that the same powers should be granted to  Sir  P.  Sykes as were  enjoyed by the Russian  commander of the Cossack division.  The &quot; statutes  of the  Russian instructions&quot; were then under  discussion;  the draft was vague, hut they would  not curtail the very wide powers hitherto exercised  by the commander.   Sir C. Marling  presumed that similar powers for  Sir P. Sykes  would suffice ; and on the 11th  March  Mr.  Balfour telegraphed [No. 77] that he approved.                         Capture of  Sinneh and Kermanshah.      Sir C. Marling  telegraphed on the 9th March [No. 97] that Sinneh  had been  captured b7 the Russians on the 5th March ; and again  on the 13th March [No. 100]  that they had  taken Kermanshah.   In  the earlier telegram  he also said  that  many  Turks were deserting.                             RUSSIAN  TURKESTAN.                         Invitation to Turkomans to Emigrate.      The Turkomans of Sarakhs. had received word from Afghanistan that those who care  to emigrate will be settled on Afghan Government land.  The Russian authorities are  taking  strict measures to prevent  emigration.  The  levy of Turkoman workmen  in  Semirechia continues.                                       INDIA.                                 Military Situation.   &quot;&apos;f  The Viceroy telegraphed on the 6th March  that there had been two small raids in  Dera Ismail Khan  and Peshawar; and it was reported that there was&apos; a  widespread  conspiracy in Laspur to throw off the yoke of the Mehtar  of Chitral.  On the 7th March
he telegraphed in  regard  to the Mahsuds saying  that Sarwekai was surrounded,  butconfident of holding out; the Mahsuds were reported to be preparing to oppose  themovable column which reached nil Kach on  the 6th March.  The Amir had been asked ito prevent  his subjects from joining the Mahsuds.   On the 10th March he telegraphedthat the movable column had reached Sarwekai  on the morning  of  the  9th without opposition, and  had reported all well.  The Mahsud lashkar had dispersed on  theprevious evening.     He telegraphed again on the 12th March that the agitation against the Mehtarhad collapsed on the arrest  of the  ringleaders.   There was no change to report in thegeneral military situation.                             Indian Opinion at Oxford.     A  report has been received that the recent speech of Lord Curzon in the Houseof Lords on affairs in Persia  and  the Near East has aroused considerable interest amongthe Indian  students  at Oxford and  excited  a good  deal of comment.   It is  generallyconsidered  that matters  are rather  more complicated than  is allowed to appear,  andsuch  remarks as  the  following are  heard:  &quot; Here is Great Britain stirring up  thesmaller nationalities and rendering  the future of the Near East increasingly difficult.&quot;&quot; Persia is  worse than  Belgium.&quot;  &quot; In  Hejaz the British are playing the same game asthey did in Egypt.&quot;   &quot;Medina is still in the  hands  of Turkey.&quot;   &quot; They  are  forcing awar  at and near  Mecca.&quot;  &quot; The Amir of Kabul  is  not  a  fool;  he is watching; hischance  will come.  But  he  must know that he  cannot  be allowed to annex an inchof India to  his kingdom;   he  must enter into an  understanding with the IndianNationalists.&quot;   This latter how far,  that is, the Amir is friendly towards the IndianNationalists being the subject of special interest.     Certain of the more extreme Nationalist students are endeavouring  to popularisethe idea &quot; the Sherif  of Mecca  should be shot.&quot;  These  men  are Hindus, and they know that the idea would please the Muhammadans.  The  centre of Islam, they say, isin danger, and Great Britain is the wire-puller.  When it  is objected that there is no connection  between Indian  Nationalists and the centre of Islam at Mecca, they reply that all loyalty to Government  must be destroyed first  and a hatred of Governmentuniversally inculcated,  and then  national propaganda will be successful.                                AFGHANISTAN.                                General Situation.     The Viceroy telegraphed on the 12 th March that the general military situation  wasunchanged.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. E.

- 87105                         ARABIA.                 North-Eastern  Desert.                Tribal Fights in the  Shamiyah.   [Compiled from Arab reports, recorded by A. P. 0. Zubeir.]     Human nature being what it is and at bottom the same in the  Arab as  in the . European,  pugnacious,  ambitious   and covetous, sometimes loyal but mainly  treacherous, occasionally enlightened but always restless the tribal fights in the Shamiyah desert may be expected to exhibit the same to and fro, change and interchange, of. alliances as may be  found in the history of the relations between the various nations which compose Europe. The redeeming featm-e of the picture is its comparative  blood- lessness.  Normally, an Arab fight means the taking of an enemy by.a surprise raid, and the casualties may be in some cases more, in others rather less, than those of a football match.  As a rule, no prisoners are taken.  By that  phrase, ill-omened  as it is to us more barbarous  Europeans, it  is not  meant  that  they  are killed.   A man who surrenders gives up his rifle, his horse,  and even his clothes, except the  bare  minimum  that will  save  a blush.   He  is  then let  go.    At times,  however, the fight is waged without respite and without mercy, and, considering  the numbers engaged, with sanguinary results.  The history of these fights has its own intrinsic interest, apart from any lesson it may convey about the possibility of relating the tribes together under the  influence o  an external power.  For those concerned,  the story has landmarks as great to Bedouins as  are Hastings and Waterloo to us.  What  to  Ibn  Rashid  and Ibn Suweit  are Hastings or Waterloo compared with the battle of  the  Reeds or the battle of Naba ?     We  will begin from the time  Avhen Saadun Pasha,  the Muntafiq chief, had been driven back from north of the Euphrates and made the Shamiyah desert his  own particular &quot; dira &quot;  and sphere of influence.   The  great  Muntafiq family  of  Saadun- not native to Iraq by origin, for they boast themselves descended from the nobles of Mecca had built itself  a ring of wells  and forts  extending from Ghabashiyah  through  Chabdah and Shagrah to  Abu  Grhar and  Neba,  a ring of defiance to any attempt  of the  alien Turk to reduce their proud  souls to sub- jection.  The great  Saadun had  once carried  his arms to  the very walls of Basrah itself.  When the disciplined forces of the Turks  at length drove  this  unruly element  into the desert, Saadun Pasha set up his standard  there,  and virtually  pro- claimed himself king of the Shamiyah.     But there was another enemy beside the Turk.   These desertforts were both a defence against the inevitable raids  of Arab enemies and a base for their tenants&apos; own raids.   The Bedouin hasno work and no play.    His only work and  only play  is the &quot;ghazzu,&quot; or raid.   The fashion was  set and sealed  by that arch-raider, the Prophet; and though  a raid appears to us in the
light of mere theft, to the, Bedouins it is a legitimate ebullitionof spirits, albeit it has. rules more  binding with them than  therules o  International Law with us. :    To return  to Saadun, if one man could be regarded as king of the desert  more than  another, it was  Ibn Rashid, the greatShammar  Emir.   His traditional enemy, Ibu Saud, Emir  ofNejd, was at this time at the lowest ebb  of  his  power,   Therewas no one to contest Ibn Rashid&apos;s supremacy.  When, therefore,Saadun Pasha set up  his standard  in  the  Shamiyah, Ibn Rashidsaid:  &quot; This cannot be.  There cannot be two standards in  thedesert.&quot;  Whether his  or  Saadun&apos;s actions  were influenced bysecret encouragement  from the Turks, it  is difficult to say.   Atany rate, some  sixteen years ago, rumours came to the environsof Khamisieh  that Ibn Rashid  was  preparing  a great  raid onSaadun.  Saadun, therefore, collected his forces and made all readyto repel the attack.  Besides Muntafiq tribes, he had with him theDhafir,  a Bedouin  tribe  derived   in  part  from  Hijr,  north of the  Hejaz,  which  had  long  ago  been  driven  thence  andhad settled in the district between Koweit, the Shammar and  theEuphrates.  This tribe in its day  has been as strong as any inthe Shamiyah.   In the time of the present Sheikh&apos;s grandfather,Sultan Ibh Suweit, or of   his  brother, Jalan, its easily dissolvedelements were united  by the personal influence  of  the  Sheikh.Without such  personal influence, the temptations to disunion are obvious from the position of the tribe, situated as it normally is between  Shammar and Muntafiq, and, therefore, requiring to haveinfluence with both sides.   On  this occasion a number  of  theDhafir were with Saadun.  Many of them did not enter into  theaffair at all.  The Muntafiq and the Dhafir together were ready for all emergencies ;  but no raid came.  Thinking they had been collected by a false alarm, the tribes to a  great extent dispersed,Saadun himself  remaining encamped  east of Khamisieh by  thereeds.   This was Ibn Rashid&apos;s chance ;  and one. day Saadun&apos;sfollowers observed a  mysterious cloud of dust  on the southernhorizon.  They sent out the usual scouts who returned to report thecoming of a host of Shammar.   It  was too late for all Saadun&apos;sfollowers to flee.  He himself escaped towards Sakhariyah.   TheShammar easily defeated the  rest, and captured  a great bootyof horses and  camels.  This was  the well-known battle  of  theReeds  (El-Barxliyah).   Ibn Rashid encamped  for  a time  atTell el-Jibarah  and then retired to his own country.    Saadun  Pasha,  desirous  of  avenging  his  defeat, tookadvantage of a quarrel between  Mubarak  Ibn Sahah, Sheikh  ofKoweit,  and  Ibn Rashid  to ally  himself with  Ibn Sabah.   Afamous  merchant  of  Koweit, one  Yusuf el-Ibrahim, who hadseceded from Mubarak after his act of fratricide  (he  had killedhis two brothers, Mohammed and Jara), went over to Ibn Rashid.Mubai&apos;ak, angry at his defection, employed some of his wealth inthe arming of  Ibn Saud,  and readily accepted the invitation ofSaadun to  join forces against the  common enemy^.   This timeJalan Ibn  Suweit, Sheikh op; the Dhafir,  refused to.join  the
 confederacy.   The three,  Saadun, Ibn  Sabah  and  Ibn Saud. joined forces in Nejd.  But Ibn Rashid was too strong for them, and  defeated the confederacy with ease  in a battle  known as &quot; El-Turafiyah,&quot; from the place where it  was fought.  This took place the year after the battle of the Reeds.      After  this time there appears to be  a lull  in  important events.   Though there were continual raids, there  was no fight of any importance.  Ultimately a quarrel arose  between  Ibn Sabah and  Saadun.  A  section  of  the Dhafir,  called Es-Said, consistently friendly to  Saadun,  captured a number of  Ibn Sabah&apos;s camels.  Ibn Sabah asked Saadun to procure their return. He refused, and his refusal led  Ibn  Sabah to call  in  aid from Ibn Saud.  Ibn Saud was  not  strong.  Two of his tribes,  the Muteir and the Ajman,  had left  him.  Hence  it  was  only  a meagre force  he sent to the help of Ibn  Sabah.   Such as they were,  their  forces  reached   Arkhamieh,  where they were surprised by  a mixed body  of  Dhafir, Zayyad, and  Muntafiq (including  the Budur), under Saadun.  The Zayyad  are not  a Muntafiq tribe.  They belong to a confederacy known as  the Beni  Mucheim,  and  dwell south and about Samawah.   But their friendship with the  Dhafir dates back to many years ago, and  bodies of them continually appear  in  Shamiyah fights. There was  no real battle on this occasion.  The forces  of  Ibn Sabah and  Ibn Saud were captured without a struggle.   Hence this event is known as the  Hadiyah or &quot; the Gift.&quot;  That such events are possible  is only  intelligible  to  those  who  know  the distance and pace that can be accomplished by Arabs  intent on a raid. The &quot; Hadiyah &quot; took place in the spring nine years ago.     The following summer  Saadun went to Baghdad on a visit to the Wali, Kaclhim Pasha.  The Muteir, a Nejdi tribe normally of the following of  Ibn Saud, heard of this, and judged it a good opportunity for a raid.  They came to Ibn Sabah and said &quot; Now that Saadun has gone to Baghdad, there is  great chance of booty from  the Dhafir and the Muntafiq.  Let  us make a  raid upon them.&quot; Not loth  to attempt revenge upon the Dhafir for  his late disaster, Ibn Sabah and the  Muteir made a considerable raid  on the Dhafir  at Shagrah, and succeeded in capturing much booty. News of the  raid came to Saadun at Baghdad, and was reported to  the Wali.   The  Wali offered to  establish  Saadun in  the position of  Emir of the Iraq  tribes and Koweit if  he would overthrow Ibn Sabah.  Saadun  always ambitious, agreed to  the project, and set out to collect his forces.  Among others he took with  him the Dhafir.  His forces arrived  as far  as the Ashgag, between  the  Safwan and  Jahrah,  to  the west.   Ibn  Sabah hearing of their approach,  and always in touch  with the Dhafir,to&apos;  the extent even of allowing them to take &quot;khawa&quot; on goodsgoing  from Koweit, or paying  them a certain  sum to  foregotheir ancient practice, got into secret touch with  the leaders  ofthis tribe.   The  mare of  a  Saadun noble, Yusuf el-Mansur, was killed  by them and made  a ground of quarrel,  with the resultthat  the  Dhafir  quietly  deserted  Saadun  and&apos;  frustrated  the
enterprise.   Saadun  gave  up his  quest ;  but  though  stillnominally  friendly  with the  Dhafir,  he  determined to  takerevenge  for  their treachery.   He  wrote secretly to Ibn Rashidinviting  him  to co-operate in  the punishment of  the Dhafir.Were  he to agree to this, he was  to appear with a following atthe  Dahanah,  the  sandy, desert  in the  middle of  Shammarterritory.  Meanwhile, Saadun  himself  would take  his followingincluding the  Dhafir to the Dahanah.   Ibn Rashid fell in  withthe plan, and the parties met at the Dahanah.  Ibn Rashid called the  headmen  of the  Dhafir   to  him  and asked  them for  an explanation of  their conduct.   There  seems to have been  noexcuse for  them, and Ibn Rashid  fined them 500 camels.   TheDhafir were fairly trapped and had to submit to  this imposition.But Saadun knew them too well to let Ibn Rashid depart without taking further safeguards against the future conduct of the tribe.Hence it was arranged that five of the Dhafir chiefs should go ashostages  with  Ibn Rashid.  So the parties dispersed ; but the emir&apos;s chiefs, whether of their own free will or  under  the  secretpersuasion-  of  the   captive  Dhafir, came to  the  Emir  and represented  the  harshness of his judgment.  Had not  the Dhafiralready paid their fine of 500 camels ?   Was it just, further, totake captive five of their chiefs ?   The Emir was convinced  bytheir arguments and released the hostages two days after he tookthem.   As  might be expected, the  liberated chiefs hastened totheir tribe, intent  on  revenge, collected  their &quot; Khail &quot;  and&quot; Jais,&quot; and overtook and  routed   Saadun  and his  following,south of Shagrah at El-Jaraibiyat.     Saadun retired to Khamisieh while the Dhafir settled in theenvirons of Zubeir,  at  Safwan and Shwebdah.   One  section  ofthe  Dhafirj the Saud, were at  the  time  with the Shaminar, but now  came  to   join  Saadun  at  Kharaisieh.   Saadun and  hisfollowing with the addition of  the  Saud moved  to Alowi.   Thiswas within easy distance of the Dhafir, who straightway collectedtheir forces, drove Saadun out, and returned to their tents.     The Turks  had  chosen this time to send  agents  to Basrahand to approach Saadun on the question of making him Emir  ofthe Dirat el-Muntafiq on  the Shatt el-Hai.  Mubarak Ibn Sabahwas then  at Muhammerah and had got into touch with SeyyidTalib.  It  is  said  that  he  offered  Seyyid Talib  3,000  lirasto persuade  the Government  to  seize   and imprison Saadun.Seyyid Talib agreed and represented to the Turkish agents  howfatal a policy it  would be  to make a  turbulent spirit like Saaduuhead of a combine of tribes notorious for  its unruliness.  &quot; let me only bring Saadun to Basrah&quot; he said &quot;and the rest is easy.&quot;     What follows is famous in Arab history.  The Turkish agentscomplied with the infamous proposal of Seyyid  Talib.  Saadunwas invited to the latter&apos;s house, the well-known Beit  el-Naqib,accepted  the invitation  without suspicion, and duly  appeared.By arrangement of  Seyyid Talib, Saadun was to sleep  secure forthe night, and was to be invited next morning to a repast while
- 91  -107 Seyyid Talib  was to excuse himself on the plea that he  had business in the harem.   When Saadun had eaten, the  Turkish agents  sent men  in the  guise of  emissaries of the Wali to invite him to  appear before  the Wali  at  the  Serai.  The plan was successfully carried out.  Saadun left Beit  el-Naqib with the supposed emissaries of the  Wali.  When, however, they reached the Serai,- they  were told that the Wali  had gone to Ashar. Saadun  still  unsuspecting  was taken  to  Ashar in  a bellam and from there straight to  a  Turkish gunboat where he  was informed he was a prisoner.  The boat left quietly in the night, and on his arrival at Baghdad Saadun was taken to Aleppo where he remained a  prisoner and ultimately died.   From  the time of Seyyid Talib&apos;s signal act of  duplicity, the great  Muntafiq chief passes  out of  history, and  his place  is  taken by  his  second son, Ajaimi.     Ajaimi was at  this  time  besieged by  the Budur in a  fort north-west of  Nasiriyah,  at Maiyah.    The  Turkish  agents secured his release and let him go.   He  fled  to the  Ghazzi,  but the Sheikh of  the  Ghazzi, Ibn Hubiyib,  was  not  prepared to take on his shoulders the onus of  protecting this restless spirit, and Ajaimi was-compelled to seek protection  elsewhere.  Isolated but not despairing, he mounted his dhelul, rode almost alone to Hail, and  knelt his camel before the great Emir.  &quot; I claim your protection, 0 Emir,&quot; he said, &quot; and your help  to  avenge me on my enemies.   This you owe me as a right; for it was while he  was under your protection, that my father, Saadun, was set upon  and defeated by the  Dhafir.&quot;   At  Hail  he stayed for some  time, until at length  Ibn Rashid consented to help him to attack  the Dhafir.  Ajaimi went to call in the help  of the Juwarin.   Ibn Rashid, on the first occasion he met the  enemy, fled and brought in  the  help of Dhari ibn  Tawala  and the Aslam.    Then he returned to the fight, and attacked and defeated a combined body of Dhafir and Budur between Shagrah and Abu Ghar.  Ajaimi arrived one day late.  Ibn Rashid returned to Hail and  left  the Muteir, whom  he had also  called to his help, as a protection to Ajaimi.     This  was   in   the  spring of   1913.   Next  winter  the Dhafir  and the Budur returned  from  their  summer quarters north and  west of Nasiriyah.   Ajaimi was still able to call in the Muteir, but, fearing he was not strong enough  to repel  attacks, he appealed to the Muntafiq sympathies  of  sections of the Beni Malik and drew  a body  of  them  to his  side.   The opposing forces  met somewhere between Shagrah aud  Arkhamieh ;  but before  they met, the Budur had entered  into secret negotiations with the Beni Malik ; for the Budur, too, are a Muntafiq tribe. The Beni  Malik either fled  or offered  only a weak resistance,with the  result that  Ajaimi and  the  Muteir  were routed, andtheir effects and animals were  captured.  Ajaimi fled with  hisscattered forces to Safwan, where he remained until the summer. He  then   removed  to  Ghabashiyah,  where he  perpetrated a ruthless  act of robbery  upon  an  unoffending  relation.   His
father&apos;s cousin, Mazyad, carae to settle with him  and deposited,in a building known as &quot;Mazyad&apos;s treasury,&quot; the sum of 60,000liras. Ajaimi  appropriated  the whole vast sum  and moved  tothe Shatt al-Hai.     Another winter arrived, and the Dhafir, as usual, began  tomove  south-east  towards  their  well-known  &quot;settling  places,Diraisiyah, Dafinah,  Abu Ghar and Suleibiyah.   Mazyad, whohad been  looking about him for opportunities  of revenge, went to the Dhafir and  appealed to them for help.  Meanwhile, Ajaimitoo crossed the Euphrates with  the  idea of revenging  himselffor  his   late   defeat.   Always generous  with  his   money,whatever  its source,  he was able, with the sum  robbed  fromMazyad, to attract a  band  of  400   mercenaries  from  variousdirections.  His force consisted of some Muteir, some Shammar,some Beni Malik  and  other miscellaneous mercenaries.   Withthese he invaded the Dhafir district,  and brought  up against theDhafir and the Budar at  Naba.   Then  ensued one  of thebloodiest  fights in  the history of tribal warfare  in the Shamiyahdesert.   The  Dhafir and  Budur  inflicted a  severe defeat  onAjaimi and his  following,  and  are  said  to have killed nearly300 of them, their own losses being  forty killed.     The following day, Mazyad, overjoyed at the  result, mountedhis horse  and galloped and curvetted before the victorious Arabs.This incongruous  act met with disfavour in the eyes of Nemesis,and the unfortunate  old  man-he  was  then  eighty fell andbroke his  neck.     Ajaimi was now at the end of his resources, and was reducedto making peace with  his  enemies.   Hence  he invited  HamudIbn Suweit,  chief of the  Dhafir,  to join  up with him nearChabdah.   Hamud consented, and settled alongside of him withsome fifty tents.   The rest of the Dhafir repudiated his overtures.Whether  Ajaimi originally  meditated treachery,  or was driven to what he did  by  the unfriendliness of the rest  of the  Dhafir,it is difficult to say.   At any rate, he quietly sent word to theMuteir, acquainting  them  with  this  splendid opportunity  ofrevenge.   The  Muteir arrived, all out for a raid.  Hamud IbnSuweit protested to Ajaimi  against this gross  act of treachery,and Ajaimi repenting, attempted to  dissuade the  Muteir.   Butthe Muteir were inexorable.  They  had come  for  a raid  or a fight at Ajaimi&apos;s  express  invitation,  and were  determined  tocarry it out.  Ajaimi had to submit- to  his own arrangement,and reverted to his original  intention of calling up the  Muteir.&quot; Qalab ala Ibn  Suweit,&quot; as the Arabs say it turned roundagainst him.  Hamud and his fifty tents fell an easy prey to theMuteir, and this affair is since known as the Qalbah.     A speedy  revenge overtook Ajaimi.   News of the eventsoon reached the Budur, ancient friends of the Dhafir and theirrefuge in  time of trouble, and two months after the Qalbah, theDhafir and the Budur defeated Ajaimi ;at Shagrah.  As thefiercest  of Arab  fights  cannot  permanently  weaken  a  tribe,
- 93 -108 inasmuch as  prisoners are normally released and  live to fight again another day, there was no hope that Ajaimi was put out of court for good and all.   So little depressed was he by his  late defeat, that not more than two months later he engineered a  raid by Ibn Rashid on the Arail section  of  the  Dhafir  at Tugayyid, while  he himself and the Muteir defeated  the Suweit section at El-Qusair.     Meanwhile,  greater events than any tribal dissensions were looming over Arabia.  Turkey had declared war on Great Britain, and the Turks, who were joined by Ajaimi with 250 sowars, were gradually driven from Fao and  Basrah.  But other events, not of such significance  to the world  at  large,  though of greater purport to  the  Jezirat  el-Arab,  began  to develop events which introduce  us to elements  and dissensions not within the scope  of  this account, which concerns chiefly the  Shamiyah desert.   But it will be useful to describe one great struggle, so as to explain  certain elements whieh can never be altogether out of relation  with the Shamiyah.   This.is a famous fight between Ibn Saud and Ibn Rashid.     The events  which led up to  it are somewhat as follows. Ibn Saud delivered an  ultimatum to the Muteir, who are really one of his  own tribes, though they had  of late joined Ibn Rashid or Ajaimi  indifferently, when  these offered occasions for plunder. He demanded their return  to his  suzerainty on pain  of permanent hostility.   The  Muteir were willing  to  return  to  their  old allegiance, and celebrated their decision  by pilfering, a caravan of 1,000 camels, which was on its way from Zubeir to the followers of Ibn  Tawala,  chief of  the  Aslam section   of the Shammar. They were then  ready to return to their own country and  join forces  with  Ibn  Saud.    At  the beginning  of  their  war  with Great  Britain, the Turks  had tried to  persuade Ibn Rashid to attack lbn  Saud in force.  Ibn  Rashid, nothing loth, collected his forces.    Meanwhile, the  Turks changed  their  minds.   It occurred to them that if they could persuade Ibn Rashid to keep his forces in the Iraq, and Ibn Saud to attack Koweit, they would at the  same time completely overawe the Arabs of the Iraq  and overthrow  a great  stronghold  of  British influence.   It  was accordingly decided to call upon  the notorious Seyyid Talib to proceed on a mission to Ibn Saud to induce  him to co-operate. At that moment  Seyyid Talib  was  occupied  in offering  us his services on extravagant  terms, and  while he was still hesitating to abate his demands, the sudden declaration of war precipitated matters and placed  him  in a dangerous situation, from which the mission  to Ibn Saud  offered him  a providential means of escape.   On reaching Ibn Saud  he placed himself into  com- munication  with  the  British  authorities, and  was allowed  to proceed to  India  via Koweit.     Meanwhile, when the possibility of  Turkey&apos;s entry  into  thewar has become likely, H.M. Government has decided to send anemissary to Ibn Saud in our own interests in the person of Captain
- 94  -W. H. I. Shakespear,  formerly Political  Agent  at  Koweit, whowas then in England.  By the time he had reached the Persian Gulf,war had already been declared, but it was none the less desired to.maintain touch- with.Ibn Saud and if possible to,get him to moveup  towards Iraq in our interests.   Captain Shakespear accordinglyproceeded from Koweit on this mission and found Ibn Saud witha large force moving towards the Shammar country to attack IbnRashid, and very confident  of  success.  His  force  included  a contingent of the Ajman tribe, a redoubtable, though at the sametime  disreputable, tribe  from the Hasa  district which  had long been estranged from its overlord but was still under  his suzeraintyand obeyed the order  for   a  general   union  of  forces.  TheMuteir too were on their  way to join, and in the circumstances itwas believed in the desert that Ibn Saud was bound to defeat histraditional enemy ;  for, in addition  to the large numbers of hisfighting men, he had with him three  or  four Turkish mountainguns with trained gunners.   But there is one factor in any Arabfight which is outside prophecy and that is treachery.    It is believed that there could have been no doubt of the result,had it not been  (according to the tales of the  Bedouin) for thetreachery of the Ajman.   They  are said to have turned  upon their own side at a  critical stage of the conflict, killed  large  num-bers,  confused  the rest,  and made off  with a  large  booty  ofcamels.     Adherents  of  either  side  naturally  give  very  differentversions of what occurred, but there is no doubt that while both parties  suffered severely from the shock of  the encounter andfrom  the depredations of the Ajman and other marauders after it,  Ibn Saud was the hardest  hit and was for the time crippled.If was in the course of this action that Captain Shakespear, whoinsisted  on  being  present  as an  interested spectator, thoughpressed by his friend and host to remain  at  a  distance, methis lamented and untimely end.   No two accounts give the sameversion of the precise circumstances of his death, and until theclouds of war have  passed over and  reliable sources from bothsides  can  be reached under  conditions  of  peace, it is  hardly possible that they can be  ascertained with certainty.    But to return to the  fight.   The Muteir were some distanceaway  when the fight began.&apos;  When they drew near and  heardthe sound of shots,  they worked round the fight to the south and finally  came up  right   behind  the  Shammar to where  theyhad left their camels.  These they seized  and made off  with andsecured large booty.   They then returned to their own countryand to the defeated  Ibn  Saud said :  &quot; Why did you  fly ?  See,we have  captured  the very  dhelul  of  Ibn Rashid himself.&quot;As indeed  they had.   But nothing  could  compensate  for thereversal of fortune caused by the treachery of the Ajman.   Andto this day Ibn Saud cherishes the hope of wiping them out to aman.   Only their repute as  fighting men-and it is often said there  are no Arabs  their  equals has  preserved, them   fromextinction.   For they  have many enemies and no friends.
- 95  -     Arabs themselves say that of Bedouins the stoutest fightersare the Ajman, and of the Muntafiq the Budur.  The Shammartoo are redoubtable, as are the  Zayyad, who occasionally appearto the help of the Dhafir.   Less reputable fighters, though famousraiders, are the Muteir and the  Dhafir.  There is no  tribe totouch  the Dhafir for what seems  to us  mere thieving, though  itis dignified by the Prophet under the name of a raid.  It will be noticed in this brief history of  tribal dissensions  that the Budurhave continually saved the Dhafir from disaster.  And indeed theDhafir owe  everything to the Budur.  Certain tribes  like theAzairij are distinguished fighters on their own ground but helplessfar afield.   It is not so with  the Budur.  At home or abroadthey display  the same  consistency of valour, and they have  aquality almost peculiar  to them, the quality of always rallying tothe standard  of their head chief in the face of a common enemy,notwithstanding their internal quarrelsomeness and a certain repu-tation for ruffianism.    It is  different with  another  similartribe, the Juwarin, who certainly at the present time find no chiefround  whom  they  will  readily  rally  at  need.   So with theZayyad ;  brave enough  as fighters, they  are split up  into  so many  ill-united sections that one cannot conceive them  rallyingto one standard.  Most of the  Shamiyah tribes have taken parton one or other of  the  many raids and fights recorded in thishistory, Dhafir, Budur, Juwarin,  Grhazzi, Zayyad.  But the pro-tagonists are the Dhafir and the Budur.  It is a curious alliance,Bedouin  and  camel  tribe with  Muntafiq  and  donkey  tribe,originating in a blood feud against a common enemy, Ajaimi.     Until the latter is eliminated from  Shamiyah by inducementor force, he  will remain,  though of no military importance,  achronic source of intrigue and centre  of unrest,  and  as  such,  anuisance to us and a valuable asset to  the  Turks.  So much  sothat Ibn Rashid is  said  to  resent Ajaimis competition for theirfavours, and at this moment their relations are definitely strained.It may be too, that it was because they realised the incompatibilityof these two elements, that the Turks,  after inviting Ibn Rashidto sit on our flank in  the Shamiyah desert, finally asked him  toreturn to Hail  and  await a more favourable  opportunity  for  asecond visit  to the Iraq.   For Ajaimi  had gradually  won the powerful Zayyad tribe to his side, and the Zayyad cannot toleratethe Shammar at any price.  It says much for Ajaimi&apos;s ascendancythat, though Ibn Rashid has departed,  the  elements he has left behind with us are in closer touch with Ajaimi then they are withtheir  ancient  overlord.   Even Dhari  Ibn Tawala, who should know Ajaimi, seeing that he was with him only a year ago, reluctant-tantly pays a tribute to Ajaimfs personality.  Ajaimi is a &quot; nafar,&quot;as the  Arabs say of an individual, a man who counts.C.L.B.
- 96  -                         Gulf Coast.Koweit.     Details about the death  of Sheikh Jabir and  the  accession of  Sheikh  Salim  have  been  sent  by  Basrah,  under  date,February  17.  It appears that for  some days before January 28,Jabir had been  suffering from  gastric fever,  for which twoEuropean doctors  were  attending  him.  After a brief  rally  hegrew worse, and native doctors replaced the Europeans.   He wascupped and bled  on February  3,  but died  on  the 5th.   Hisbrother, Salim, succeeded without any disturbance  in the  town,the suq keeping open as usual.     Salim is about fifty-five.  Sir Percy Cox gives him a bettercharacter  than our earlier information led us  to credit.  He was always  a  stronger man than his  elder brother,  and had  moreinfluence with tribesmen, partly through having been brought up in Bedouin fashion.   Had he been in Koweit at   the moment of Mubarak&apos;s death, he might have succeeded instead  of Jabir,who, as governor of the town, was on  the spot ; but, on his return from the desert, Salim accepted his brother and helped him loyally.His reputation for chauvinism and bigotry has not been confirmed by anything he has done during his brothers reign, and both  atthe Koweit Durbar last  November  and on  his accession, he hasidentified  himself with our interests.   It is  expected, therefore,that His Majesty&apos;s Government will confirm  his succession.Bahrein and Hasa.     Nothing of moment is reported from  here.   The populationseems to have recovered  from the crisis in  the  Pearl trade, andto have resumed fishing as usual.Oman.     We hear only that  the Sultan sent a congratulatory messageas  usual  to the  Political  Resident  at the New   Year.   Weconclude that the interior remains in its normal state of quiescentrebellion.                           Hejaz.                         Intelligence.     There is little to record in  the  way of operations since our last  issue.   The  Turks have evacuated Ghayir, Sath el-Ghayir,and  Khanaqat er-Rim,  i.e.,  all their advanced  posts  on  theGaha road ; but. they still  hold  Mijz, which they have stronglyentrenched, on the Fura road.   As,  however, they  have with-drawn their reserve  rations from  the latter to Bir  el-Mashi it looks as  if  they contemplated further  retirement.   On  theSultani road they have  given  up Bir Derwish and  establishedHeadquarters  at  Bir Wuhub or Bir Sheriufi, their retreat beingharried by the Rahalah Harb, who are said to have lifted 150 oftheir camels.
     Our  planes  seem  to have  exploded  something  at  Sathel-Ghayir, which was probably an ammunition dump, and, flyingto Ali&apos;s camp on February 4, tliey opportunely met  and chasedback an enemy plane.  At Medina we hear that the explosion atthe Bab Kubah barracks, which were full of Takruri soldiers, didmuch damage and caused a panic in the town.  Roads from Hailare completely closed  and scarcity increases,  the  actual  breadration being  only  about three-fifths  of the  reduced  weightdecreed  by  Jemal  Pasha.   Exodus  of the  civil  population and government officials continues, the Turks haying offered theinhabitants the choice of Mecca,  Yambo or Syria,  with (in thelast alternative) transport by rail.   Since, however, on the night of February 20, a train going north was  blown up and derailedbetween Mudurij and Toweira, this facility has been interrupted,for a time, at any rate.     It appears that in the fight at Nakhl Mubarak in Decemberthe Turks  lost  heavily, the shrapnel  of  Arab   15-poundershaving proved very effective.     A considerable part of the Hejaz Expeditionary  Force, withits guns, has been withdrawn northwards now, and is  probablydetailed along the railway.  According to one  report, not  morethan  six battalions are left in  the Medina district.   The  mainconcentration is now at Medain  Salih, where the  first  battalion of  the 16ord  Regiment  has appeared as  a reinforcement, whilethe third is at El-Ala :  the second  and fourth are expected.  Theline is now regularly patrolled by trolleys between  stations.     Feisal and Abdullah are holding the five principal  passesfrom the coast to the railway, viz., Bowat, Murabba (in WadiAis), Kharar  and  Ras  el-Nejd on the two inland routes  fromWejh,  and  Khoreitah   on  the   Dhaba Tebuk   road.    TheCircassian cavalry,  which was holding Khoreitah, has  been drivenout by the Huweitat.  Altogether the. Huweitat have accountedfor about 100 Turks, killed and prisoners.; i   Except some Billi  elements with Suleiman Jiufadah (whosebrother, however,  is with  Feisal)  and  the Maaza, the  North -Western tribes have all come in to Feisal, as have also  the Kheibarpeople.  But  action is  delayed  by the  difficulty  of adjustingtribal and clan feuds, and Feisal is  remaining at Wejh  for  sometime to come, working  eveiw day and all day  at  this  internalpacification.   He, is taking no action in regard to  any , tribesnorth of the  Beni Atiyah ; but the  Sherarat have begun  to  come in.  There was a fight between Ageyl and Ateibah at Wejb  onthe night of February 10, which might  have become  serious butfor FeisaPs energetic intervention. : But on the whole, there havebeen surprisingly little trouble between the miscellaneous elements of the latter&apos;s force.   The Juheinah, however, are getting tired ofbeing in Billi country, and are being (for the  most  part), senthome, only the  Merawin and  Rifai clansmen being  retained.The small Moahib tribe has produced 600 fighting men..     &quot; Ibn Arid,&quot;&apos; who has often been reported  helping Alb; turns
out to be Ali ibn  Areidh, chief of the Hurith, an Ateibah Sherif,resident at Modhiq, on the Fura  road.  The Hurith are a small but notorious sherifial clan of highwaymen.    Bread in Damascus has become 400 per cent dearer than inpeace-time.                          LIBYA.Raid on Siiva.     During the month of January constant reports were received that Seyyid Ahmed was meditating  a  withdrawal from Siwa tothe west.   A copy of a  letter  from  him to Seyyid  MohammedIdris was sent by the  latter to the High Commissioner of Egypt,in which Seyyid Ahmed  said that he was prepared to withdraw from Siwa in  deference to  Mohammed Idris&apos; wishes, but was unable to do  so unless  he could obtain 500 camels.  It thusappeared almost certain  that  anj&apos;  force  of  ours,  for  which even a  short period  of  concentration  would  be  required,would not arrive in time to strike a blow at the remnants of theSenussi forces with Seyyid Ahmed.     It was accordingly  decided  to employ the light armoured cars (Rolls-Royce :  three batteries of four        h), and threelight cars patrols (six Ford cars each).  The  supplies  of thiscolumn were carried by heavy  motor  lorries to Bayud, a distance of eighty-five miles  from the  base, the transport thence onwardbeing by light Ford  vans.   The plan  was to make for  Girba,where the main body  was reported to be, placing one battery ofL.A.C. and one L.C.P. at a  pass on  the road to Jaghbub, somesixteen miles west of  Girba, with a  view to  cutting off any ofthe force which might be driven out  of Girba by our main body.     The column left Matruh at dawn on February 1, and arrivedat the point  of concentration some  fifteen  miles north of theGirba escarpment on the following day  at noon.  As  information had  been  received that  the road into  Girba  had been mined, afresh pass was reconnoitred, and on the following  morning atdawn our force moved  off, and, successfuly descending by thenew pass, pushed into the oasis, where it found the Senussi force,numbering about 800, holding a very strong position at the footof  the  escarpment  on   the  S.W.  side  of   the oasis.   Twomountain  guns and two machine-guns were  at once  broughtinto  action  by  the enemy,  and  the  armoured  cars  weresubjected to a heavy and accurate fire.   Owing to the nature ofthe  ground it  was  not  possible for  the cars  to come to closerrange than  600-800  yards.  The  action  lasted  some  twentyhours, and before dawn on  the morning of February  4 theenemy hastily decamped, leaving some  fifty dead behind.     On  leaving, this  force  took   a  southerly direction intothe sand-dunes, turning  north again to strike the Jaghbub roadat the pass (Munasib), where the detached  L.A.C.B. and L.C.P.
 were waiting to intercept thein.   After suffering  some loss  here the retreating&apos;enemy again turned southwards into the sand-dune country,  through which the rest of his journey to Jaghbub must have been attended with the greatest difficulties.     FrOm  information  received it appears  that  the  enemy casualties in wounded  alone must have been not less than  200, including six Turkish officers.   It  was only the nature of the ground,  rendering  pursuit from  Girba  and  movement  in airy direction from Munasib impossible, which saved the entire enemy force from being completely wiped out.  At the beginning of the action Seyyid Ahmed,  who was in Siwa  with  Mohammed Salih, at once fled  (in  accordance  with his usual  practice)  into the sand-dunes  south of Siwa, and made off  to  the West.  Being warned of the presence of our post at Munasib, he did not attempt to break through there and turned off into the sand-dunes south. Mohammed  Salih had  come  up  to Girba  directly he received news of  the  action and taken command of the main force, and was retreating with it on the morning of the 4th.     Our force entered Siwa,  on the morning of  the  5th,  un- opposed, and was well  received  by the inhabitants.  After a day spent in  the Oasis the  whole force returned to Matruh.     The enemy were taken completely by surprise, owing to the fact  that the operation  had  been  suddenly  decided  on,  and carried out  with such  expedition.   The  Senussi  has now  been driven out of the last part of Egyptian territory he occupied, and has learned that, with motor cars at our disposal, any attempt at re-occupation would be attended by the gravest risks of  disaster. Seyyid Ahmed by this  final defeat has given further proof, if any were needed, that he is as little fitted to be. a  leader of  fighting men, &quot;as he is to  conduct the political affairs of the confraternity. It  is  possible   that  Seyyid   Mohammed  Idris   may   openly affect to  be annoyed by the episode as impairing the dignity of his family, but  in  reality, he  cannot; but realize that  his  own position is considerably strengthened, and  the final disposal  of Seyyid  Ahmed  is  facilitated  thereby.  From our point of view we  have  the satisfaction of having driven Seyyid Ahmed out  of Egypt of our own initiative, and Mohammed Idris cannot claim, as he did in the case of the evacuation of the other Oases, that he is responsible for the peaceful withdrawal of the Senussi forces from Egypt. Intercepted Letter.  1   Wehave theearlier views of Seyyid Mohammed Idris expressed frankly, and  at some length, in a personal letter sent  to  Seyyid Ahmed at Siwa, but captured by our  cars before it reached its destination.  He blames the attack on Sollum as having  brought about the blockade of their country, so that Mohammedans  are abusing, and  &quot; even cursing,&quot; the name of Seuussi.   He comparesthe  position   of  Seyyid  Idris of the  Yemen^ who  &quot; wisely.remained neutral,&quot; arid of the Sherif of Mecca; &apos;.who proclaimedhimself king.  The Turks are not fulfilling their  promises^, and
are no longer able to give any assistance ; they cannot take Egypt,,and now they send to Tripoli a man  (Baruni),  who was onceimprisoned by Seyyid  Ahmed  or treason.  The latter condemnsthe doings of the  Siwa army, which has  blackened the Senussiname for justice, observation of Mohammedan law, and humanity.Supply is no longer possible for this army, and  Seyyid Ahmedis asked to return and set his country  in order.     The following extracts  from this intercepted letter are ofparticular interest, as showing the effect which the Sherifial risingat the present moment has on the formerV mind :      &quot; Sir, look at  the  Sherif  Husein, Emir of Mecca, who  wasmade by the Turks.  He  saw that his interest and the interestof his country required him to go against them.   He proclaimedhis independence, and  asked the approval of the Allied  Govern-ments (which  he obtained),  and now he  is the  King  of  theArabs.  He is now arranging his Government, such as the form-ation of Cabinets  and other  things.   If he had  entered the warwith the  Turks,  the Allies  would have been  occupying  his country as they now occupy  Basrah  and other towns.   He pro-claimed everywhere and to  the papers that his  actions are  not against Islam, but against the Unionist Party.  He still  preachesin the name of the Khalifa,  but the Khalifa is at a loss what todo.   The  Arabs wanted  to  safeguard  their  honour from  theUnion and Progress Party.   They have proclaimed him king.     &quot; How can the Turks enter Egypt after they have failed toretake Hejaz ?  After being  near the  Canal,  they  have  to-dayretired from El-Arish, and the English have occupied Rafa, andare striking at the Hejaz railway to cut it, as those who can readmaps will inform you if you  do not  know.  Don&apos;t you see  theSeyyid Idris of  the Yemen who is still independent and did not commit himself, though the  English tried ,to persuade him tofight the Government  (Turks) ? The Government tried to incitehim against the English, but he refused.  You might have donelike himbefore the affair of Sollum.   The  Government and  theEnglish were in  your hand.  Regret is now useless.  I drawyour attention  to the Islamic world,  which desires to know you.You  must look  for what  is to our advantage and that of our country, so that we may not be sacrificed for others.&quot; Western Desert.     Our rough  handling of the Siwa soldiers at Girba is expectedto have driven them all to Jaghbub, and probably on to Jalo;they had large numbers of sick, and their journey was undertakenbefore their preparations were complete, so that  their  march islikely to be attended  with  considerable  casualties before they reach Jaghbub.  This place  is not  considered able to  supportan  army,  in  which  case there  remains  before  the latter  the difficult march to Jalo for which a six days&apos; water supply  has tobe carried.
- 101  -112Cyrenaica.     At Akroma, Mohammed Idris is busy obtaining the viewsof. all parties ; he has received two Turkish officers  from Nuri,and is asking for two delegates from  each tribe to consult withhim.   There  is great misery, because  the  blockade leads  tofrequent cattle-raids amongst the various tribes.   The immediateprospects of food are also bad, since, owing to insufficient rainfall,much less  barley  was  sown than  usual, and  a poor  crop isexpected.    A  caravan,  with ivory and ostrich feathers fromKufra, arrived at Benghazi,  and others are coming  from Jalo,showing an expectation of trade being resumed.Tripoli.     Two distinct campaigns are being prepared  in  Tripoli.  Inthe  east the  Tarhuna  appear to be joining forces  with theSenussi in order to crush Ramadan Shitewi, who  is doing all  inhis power  to collect an  army.  Two thousand Senussi, with three guns, were reported to have left  Cyrenaica for  Sert, and a simultaneous  attack may   be  made  on  Shitewi  from  northand  south.     In  Northern Tripoli, Baruni&apos;s forces are anxious to  avengetheir defeat at Agelat (east  of  Zuara), where the Italian force,which consisted of Erythreans  and  Somalis, lays claim  to 820killed and 1,200 wounded, whereas its own losses were light.     Baruni admits  heavy   losses, but is anxious   to  organizeattacks on Nuail and Zuara, saying that no help can be expected from Turkey till  Zuara is  taken.    Baruni has  among  hisfollowing:  Sheikh Sof,  Mahdi el-Sunni, Mohammed  Figheni,Khalifa ben  Askar, Mohammed  el-Shellabi, Abeda ben Zikriand Zaki el-Maghegh, and their forces at the battle of  Agelatwere rather over 4,000.   They would, therefore,  seem to have lost abaut half their  effectives.                          NOTES.Asir Tribes.     Two Turkish officers, both natives of north-east Asia Minor(one is a Laz, the other an  Erzinjian  Kurd),  who  had beenrecalled to Damascus from Ebhah last spring, were made prisonersen route at Mecca by the Emir, in June,  1916.   They  have been examined in Cairo,  and  state,  that up to the date of their departure, no Asir tribes had risen against the Turks except theGharnid, the Zahran, the Qahtan,  the Sabia group, (IdrisPs hometribes) and the Rijal el-Ma.  The last  named, who called  outeight to ten  thousand men, and  occupied strong positions, wereeasily reduced by  a Turkish  force of from 1,500 to 2,000 men,bribery being used as an auxiliary arm.   One of our informants,who was O.C. 122nd Regiment, himself commanded the  expedi-tionary force.  Idris was regarded at that time  as threateningvery little danger, his tribal following having been much reduced:
All  roads  to  Muhail  and  Qunfudah  were then  open,  andEbhah obtained supplies  quite  easily.   The  latter  town  these officers&apos;,estimate to contain about 400  houses, suburbs included.They travelled&quot; thence to Mecca in fifteen days.   They confirmour  belief  that the  Abdul Aziz ibn Hamid, who was reportedsome time ago to be leading a force of Asir tribesmen northwardto join  the King of the  Hejaz,  is the Shahran chief of  theMisheit house.   He is  about sixty years of age, a good Turk-hater, and a friend of King Husein, but he is  said to tipple.   Ourtribes, owing allegiance to no one, whether he be Turk, Idris orEmir of Mecca.The O. U. P., the Sheikh el-Islam, and the Efkaf.     The French Ministry at Berne reports  that, at the C.U.P.Congress held at  Constantinople  last October  under the presi-dency of the Grand Vezier and Talaat, it was reported  that the sheikh el-Islam had been relieved of practically all  his  temporalduties, e.g. his guardianship of orphans,  control of schools, and executive functions in  regard to sentences passed by the SheriaCourts.   These courts  are in future to be under the Ministry ofJustice, while the primary schools, hitherto maintained by theEfkaf, are to be  transferred to  the Ministry of Public Instruc-tion,  together with the special  funds  allotted  to them.   to preclude any agitation  which might be caused  among the xdemaby this measure, most  members of that body had been removed from Constantinople previously to its promulgation.     This step has been taken,  in  the  opinion  of the french minister&quot;, as a result of the  notorious disaffection  of the ulemaand in anticipation of an assumption of the Caliphate by the king of the Hejaz. In the  latter eventuality, the C.U.P. is  not  sure of the attitude of  the  ulema, and,  therefore,  wishes to  reduce their power and  influence in  good time.     [Note  by  Arab Bureau. In  any case,  this measuremarks a definite  resumption of  the C.U.P.&apos;s original secularizingprogramme, intermitted in  1909.  The Neo-Turanian movementhas strengthened its hands  since then.  We doubt if  any  con-sideration of the Caliphate has really influenced the  C.U.P. inthis connection.]Euphrates  Intelligence.     Late in December last Ajaimi Saadun was said to have  been&apos;greatly  shaken in his  pro-Turk  policy by two things, first, the news of the Turkish successes at Hillah, and second, Ibn Saud&apos;sletter urging him  to  break  with the Turks  and  Ibn  Rashid.With the last he is said to be, in any case, not on.cordial termsat  present.  His  brother,  Dhamir, who is pro-British, seemsto expect that Ajaimi may ultimately change sides.     Rashid  Ibn Lailah&apos;s  mission to  Hail, undertaken for theTurks  who had  become  alarmed  at  the continued success ofinformants  regardand  Zahran as  independent
the  Sherifs revolt,  was  a fiasco  as  he  found  no tribesmencollected at Hail.  He then went to Nejef to buy  horses  and provisions for Ibn Rashid, but the tribesmen would not let thesepass south.  He  is said to be still  waiting near Nejef.   [Laterreport says he has reached Hail.]     Ibn  Ajil, Chief  of  the  Abdah  Shammar,  was reportedoh January 12,  to  have left  Ajaimi and to be  about  to  joinIbn  Rashid.  [Later report says he  has gone to Ajfah, betweenHail and  Sllaibah, where Ibn Rashid is expected.] Wejh  Papers.                                           ..  .     Military  papers,  captured at Wejh in  January, and  readin Cairo,  confirm Our intelligence about a progressive reductionof Turkish food rations in the  last months of 1916.    Jemal,O.C.  Ivth  A.C., ordered the  bread ration  to be  reduced  to two-thirds  on  November 15,  and  to  one-half on December 2.On December 15, he issued a general corps order fixing the rationat 400 grammes.     The  commandant of Wejh complained frequently, and  withgrowing  insistence,  to the Military Governor  of  Medina aboutthe  shortage  of bread, other  foodstuffs, and  forage ;  also.Ofthe state of his men&apos;s clothing, and of the  arrears into which pay to volunteers, and subsidies to sheikhs and tribesmen had fallen. He  showed great solicitude about both Suleiman Rufadah andother Billi chiefs, and also Saad el-Ghaneim, of the Musa Juheinah.The last he continued to regard as loyal up to autumn, 1916.     He mentions the  pillaging by Rifaa Juheinah, near Yambo,of the boat which, contained  Stotzingen&apos;s  baggage ; the latter&apos;sIndian servant, Mohammed Effendi; lost L.T. 85 in that affair. -    The outbreak and early success  of the Hejaz revolt, says the commandant, made  the local  Arabs very uppish;  but   theirattitude changed after  the success of a Turkish sortie to Bir  Aar,near Medina, in  July.Shortage in Syria.    The  Ikbal   of   Beyrout  published  on  January  24, thefollowing  significant paragraph :     Tickets for flour,  which were given six months  ago   to theinhabitants are now cancelled.   The  Government finding that thepresent available quantities  of flour are  short of  the quantitiesassigned in these tickets, have decided to take these tickets  back from the inhabitants and to issue in  their stead, tickets for lesserquantities, a  quarter  of  the  quantity  allowed   before.  1  Thepublic  are requested  to  return  these  tickets and take back thebalance of  the value of flour not yet delivered, as shown on thesetickets, and new tickets will be issued to them.The &quot; Cleansing of the Temple.&quot;    The  Ikbal,  on  January 27, gave the  following  interestingversion of  proceedings which  King  Husein, on his side, reports
to us  as, wholesale robbery  and  violation  of  the Prophet&apos;sMosque :      When H.E. Ibrahim Bey Effendi lately visited Medina, heissued  his orders that all the buildings newh/ constructed around the Holy  Sepulchre should be pulled down,  in  order  to  allowmore space around it.  He also ordered repairs to  be made in the holy Sepulchre itself and to have it cleansed from everything thatis contrary to the morals  of Islam.  He raised the salaries of theImams, orators  and attendants  of  the  Holy   Sepulchre, anddistributed gifts among  the poor in  Medina.  He  also orderedrepairs to be made  in the Tomb of Hamza, and the prevention ofwomen from attending prayers in the Holy Sepulchre, (as hasbeen the custom hitherto,) in  accordance with the new  law that women are not allowed to attend  prayers or  any other  meeting with men.   He fixed special hours of prayer for women.   his orders  have been all executed and the necessary repairs are nowbeing carried out.Sheikh Arslan and Sheikh Shawish..    Journal  de Beyrout, January 17. The Emir  Shekib BeyArslan, deputy for the  Hauran, and hitherto editor-in-chief of theSharq, has left Damascus for Constantinople.     Sheikh Abdul  Aziz Effendi  Shawish,  who has  been inBerlin, where he  published  a review in  the  German language,has now returned to Constantinople.  He  has  begun the  publi-cation  of a new Arabic review, entitled :  El Alam el-Islami.     [Note  by  Arab  Bureau. The German Review isDie Islamtsche Welt.  It began last November with  a defamatoryarticle  about  King  Husein, who is particularly obnoxious to the editor because his action deprived the latter of the honours and profits of the Directorship of the projected Medina University.]
