SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE  ATTACHED&apos;  EASTERN  REPORT  No.  XXII.                          STOCKHOLM PEACE CONFERENCE.     THE views of the so-called American delegates are included in, this report, as&apos; it is to be presumed that their suggestions apply to the whole world, including the Middle East.     It is to  be noticed that there is specific mention of Alsace-Lorraine and Poland, but no reference  is  made  to Armenians, Arabs,  or other nationalities subject to the military despotism of the Turks.     Although the case for recognition of these national  political elements is over- whelming from a sentimental point of view, there has been, so  far as is  known, no reference to them by any of the various revolutionary  and Socialist  groups who are striving  for an &quot;international&quot; peace in the  various Allied countries.  This omission is the more remarkable in  view of M. Dcividovitch&apos;s association with the suggestions, his reference to Jewish colonisation in Palestine, and his definition of  Jewish national aspirations.                                        RUSSIA.     Colonel Marshs suggestion in regard to Armenians  in  the Caucasus is important. In the Armenians we have a people  of intelligence and capacity who desire victory for the Allies and, owing to previous experience, are less influenced by theoretical ideas than most people  in Russia.  It might be of value to  mention this movement to the French, who are especially interested in Armenia, and  have already a very satisfactory Armenian battalion established in Cyprus.     The news in regard to the Black Sea fleet is regrettable, as this unit had hitherto shown a good  fighting spirit, and a desire to defeat the enemy.                                     TURKEY.     The  Turkish  Liberal  parties suggesting  peace terms  are similar to  those  putforward by Prince Saba-ed-Din in 1915 (June).  Such terms  may mean anything or nothing, as they entirely depend on  the physical guarantees of their being carried intoeffect.                                     ARABIA.     The  Italian proposals to give the  King of Hejaz military assistance shows  thenecessity of the King having some  reliable military force of his own at his disposal.At present  his tribesmen, though  numerous, are  quite unreliable in the event of anyserious move being made by the Turks.  There ds no danger during the months of july and August, but the rains and cooler weather of the September-March period  mayconfront  us with a danger similar to that experienced  last year during the Rabeghcrisis.

                                     PERSIA.    The Persian situation and the Government of India&apos;s views thereon deserve careful study.  The  influence of the Russian revolution  on  Persian  nationalism is having  itsanticipated effect.  It is  worth considering that the Turkish  Pan-Turanian politiciansmay be impressed with the fact that the present anarchy gives them  a  good oppor-tunity of linking up Asia Minor with Bokhara, Samarcand, and Afghanistan.               &quot;  &quot;                                                        M.

Sir Esme Howard telegraphed on the 23rd June[No.  1929] that the  American  delegates  to the Stockholm Peace  Conference had suggested the following principles as a basis for the work of the International SocialistConference  which they had come to attend:  (1) No war indemnities  or contributions.(2) No annexations ; colonies and other occupied territories with the exception of poland to be restored.   (3)  An independent and  united Poland  to be established accordingto the  will of  the  people  expressed  by referendum  in each  of  the three  parts.(4) Same principle to be applied to Alsace-Lorraine  and other territories  in  dispute.(5) Recognition of the right of all peoples to decide their own destiny.   InternationalistSocialists should encourage formation of Balkan United States and United  States ofEurope.   (6)  Restoration  to former condition of devastated  regions such as Belgium,Serbia, Galicia.   (7) An international agreement as  to disarmament and  freedom ofthe  seas.  (8) The  abolition of secret  diplomacy.   The Peace Congress  to consist of delegates specially elected by belligerent and neutral peoples, not exclusively diplomatic and  officials.  (9) The  establishment of an international institution to superintend alldecisions between nations, with power to exclude such nations as set aside its decisions.For&apos; securing the speedy end of the  war,  the delegation  favoured  the immediateestablishment and endowment of a permanent international socialist committee to workout the decisions of the impending Socialist International Conference.     The Jewish proletarian party,  represented by  M.  Davidovitch,  associated itself with  the above views, and  proposed the abolition of all restrictions for Jews, nationalautonomy recognised  by the  State  and internationally guaranteed for  Jews in thosecountries where they live  in  large and  clearly  defined  communities, and  complete freedom  of  emigration and  immigration.  It called  attention to  the  laws hinderingJewish immigration and colonisation in Palestine.                                  ,       [898-49]                                                            B
RUSSIA. ............General Situation. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 21st June [No. 945] thatMr.  Lindley had asked M.  Terestchenko for  his  views  on  the internal situation.M. Terestchenko said in  reply that (l)  he  was  not at all frightened by the Ukraineresolutions; the movement was contrary to the whole current opinion of Bussia, andwould fizzle out; he himself was a native of Kieff; (2) threats had been made by someof the Petrograd militia to use force if their demands were not  complied with, but theGovernment had refused the  demands and  disbanded the men ; (3)  at  Moscow the strikes in some of the railway shops had been settled without concessions on the part ofthe  Government; (4) the news from the south-west front was  better than he had expected; (5) for the moment the  political situation was less  disquieting than theindustrial and financial.  In  the provinces conditions varied very much.- At Tomsklaw and order had been completely restored, but [? Tsa] [ ? Besij trin was still in revolt.     Council of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the22nd June [No.  95 0] that on that day the Council was considering the  war, and  Leninhad made a violent  attack on the allies and  their imperialist aims.    M. Kerenskyhad  replied by saying  that  he would read  his speech, which was almost verbally thesame as that of Lenin, the only difference of importance being, as M. Kerensky pointedout, that  it was  signed by [?].  It  was, in fact, the  latest German wireless  message.The debates of the  Council had so far gone as well  as could possibly be expected, butit  was useless  to  hope  for  a really  satisfactory  resolution in regard  to  the war.M. Terestchenko had told  him that the Government would not comply with the request that the  Duma should be dissolved ; although it had abandoned some of  its functions in  favour of the temporary committee nominated in the first days of the  revolution, itwas a very useful support to the Government.     M&apos;. Kerensky and the Petrograd Garrison. Colonel Blair telegraphed on the 21stJune that M. Kerensky had ordered the despatch to the front of practically the whole ofthe Petrograd garrison,  an order which it was impossible to carry out.   If M. Kerenskyinsisted, Colonel Blair was of opinion that there would certainly be trouble.     Caucasus Front-Sir G.  Buchanan telegraphed on the 20th June [No. 939] thatthe military attache  had  received  a letter from Colonel Marsh proposing  that the armenians should be armed and organised. &apos; He said that there were 50,000 of military age anxious to fight,  and only required arms and  organisation ; they had good leaders,and plenty of interpreters for English.     The Black Sea Fleet. Sir  G. Buchanan  telegraphed on the  21st  June [No. 943]that M. Terestchenko had informed Mr. Lindley that the whole fleet  was in mutiny.The men had turned out the committee of officers and men, who had  been working  inharmony,  and had appointed a  new committee.   Some of the officers had been disarmed.Prince Lvov and M. Kerensky telegraphed to  the  men, telling them  that they mustimmediately reinstate the officers and the old committee  and return to their allegiance.After a few hours the men expressed contrition, and agreed to do everything required.M. Terestchenko  attributed the mutiny to the influence of men from Kronstadt andthe neighbourhood of Petrograd, who  worked  the  mischief in three  days;  till their arrival the fleet had, since the time of M. Kerensky&apos;s visit, been in splendid spirits.  sir g. Buchanan added that the incident was a good  illustration of the present instabilityof the  Russian rank and file.                                    POLAND.     Relief of Distress [see Eastern Report, XX, p. 3]. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to sir g. Buchanan on  the  15th June [No. 1354], in  reply to  his telegram  of the  8th June[No. 857].,  He said that the  proposal had been  sympathetically considered, but theprevious attitude must be reluctantly  maintained in the  absence of  any satisfactoryevidence of the existence and actual  working of a proper system of effective control andlocal distribution ; consent could not be given to the export of foodstuffs to Poland, as,failing such  a  system  of control,  supplies so  imported  would  directly benefit theGermans, as they would replace the starvation rations now allowed to the population.On the same date Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir H. Bumbold [No. 620] requesting himto  inform the Polish Relief Committee at Vevey as to this decision.     The American Polish Legion [see Eastern Report,  XXI, p. 2]. Sir G. Buchanantelegraphed on the 21st June [No. 942] that M. Terestchenko had told Mr. Lindley that,in  the opinion of M. Kerenski, no Polish officers could be spared for  the legion  to  beraised, in  America.   Mr.  Lindley  considered  that the best course  would be for  theAmerican Government to  ask  the Russian Government  for officers.  Sir G. Buchanan
Itadded that this course appeared the more desirable as the military attache had reportedthat the Polish regiments showed but little more inclination to fight than the Russian.                                      RUMANIA.(H      Military Service. Mr. Balfour  telegraphed  to  Sir  G. Barclay on the 26th  June   [No. 216] that the Rumanian  Government wished to  conclude  a convention with His   Majesty&apos;s Government whereby British  subjects in  Rumania and Rumanian  subjects   in Great Britain would have either to return to their respective  countries for  military   service or would become liable for^ailitary service in the army of the country of;their   residence.   His Majesty&apos;s Government were about to conclude a similar agreement with   Russia, and  possibly also with France, Italy, and the United States of America, and   the necessary legislation for the purpose was being passed here.   The main drawback,   he said, to the  agreement with Rumania was the difficulty and expense of the journey   home  of  British subjects in Bumania, since  they  could not be  forced  to  join the   Rumanian army if they expressed a desire to return.   Sir G.  Barclay was  asked to   telegraph a rough estimate of the British  subjects  who would  have to  be sent home   vi&amp; Russia.   Obviously, Mr. Balfour said, if the  number were at all large it would be   impossible to proceed with the agreement.                                       TURKEY.        Resliid Pasha on Terms of  Peace. In a despatch dated the  loth  June Sir  H.   Rumbold transmitted  a copy of a letter he had  received from  Dr.  Parodi, of  Geneva,   in response to a request that he should ascertain  the  views of the leaders of the Turkish   liberal party residing in Geneva,  as to the basis on which that party, if in power, would   be prepared to  conclude a separate peace.        Writing on the llth June, Dr.  Parodi  said  that  the chief leaders  of the liberal   party were  then in Geneva, and one  of them,  Reshid Bey, who  had  been Minister   of the Interior  in  the Cabinet of Kiamil Pasha, had, in the course of conversation,   indicated the views of his party in regard to a separate peace.   Dr.  Parodi added that   these terms might be regarded as the maximum of the Turkish opposition.  They were   as follows :         1.  Constantinople must remain  the  capital of the Ottoman Empire, and it would              be   desirable  that  it should by  a  suitable rectification of  frontier  be              guaranteed from the possibility of aggression on the  part of Bulgaria.        2. The straits should be freely open to commerce, under the guarantee  of all the              powers, and there should be  no fortifications.        3. The  Armenian question  must  be resolved by the allies : the Turkish liberal              party  absolutely disapproved the massacres, but  they  would not propose              reforms, for reform had so  often been promised without  effect that now the              best course was a radical solution of the  difficulty.        4. In regard to Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine they recognised that a complete              reorganisation, on the basis of the most extensive administrative autonomy,              was necessary.  These, provinces with Turkey in Asia, properly so called,              should form a confederation with a strongly  decentralised Government,  for              this alone could restore prosperity to  the Ottoman Empire.        5. Hejaz would be recognised as  an  independent kingdom ; the question of the              Caliphate  being settled by  Moslems, who alone  had any interest in the              matter.        6. The  independence of the other Arabian emirs would also be recognised subject               to a tribute equivalent to the amount of the customs duties formerly levied              by  Turkey.  Should they so wish they might later on form themselves into              a confederation.        7. In regard to Egypt, Turkish sovereignty  would be abandoned.        Reshid  Bey  added  that  on the  conclusion of peace  it would  be indispensable   that the allies should make a considerable loan to Turkey.  And he  had  prefixed to  his   statement of  terms an expression  of  opinion  that  the allies would not conclude a   peace with the Committee of Union and Progress, so  that the first necessity would be   a revolution.

                                   ABYSSINIA.     Another  Request  for  Aeroplanes  [see  Eastern  Beport  III, p. 3 ;  IV, p.  3 ; VII, p. 4 ;  X, p 3. ; XI, p.  4]. Sir R. Wingate transmitted [No.  657] on the 20th June a telegram despatched from Adis Ababa on the  18th June.  Mr. Thesiger said  that he had again been asked for aeroplanes by Ras Taffari, as the leaders of the Government troops  had reported Magdala to be impregnable, and that,  in reply, he had asked 0 whether, if the three powers agreed to  lend aeroplanes,  the  Abyssinian Government would be  prepared  to  give  the  German and Turkish Ministers their  passports.  Ras replied that this was impossible, and was then told that he could hope for no assistance so long as his Government merely  talked  of  their friendship to  us  but  allowed  an hostile mobilisation against  our interests to be  carried on by  the German Minister. Mr. Thesiger recommended a  joint  protest   in  regard  to  the  German  mission. Mr. Balfour telegraphed in reply on the 26th June [Egypt, No. 643] saying that before again  approaching the  military authorities he wished to have  Mr. Thesiger&apos;s opinion as to (1) the military and  (2) the political effect of acceding to Ras Taffari&apos;s request. He asked for information as to the military situation in general,  and in particular as to the  use of sending  aeroplanes when the rainy  season would shortly put a stop to military operations.                                 SOMALILAND.     TJie Guda Incident [see  Eastern Report XX, p. 4]. Sir R.  Wingate telegraphed on the 21st June [No. 658] that the naval commander-in-chief had  received a report from the senior naval officer of the Red Sea patrol to the effect that the possibility of help being required in regard to the incident at  Guda  [north-west  of  Jibuti, between Lake Asal  and Tujura]  was not anticipated by the French  consul at  Aden, who said that a small column of Senegalese troops had been sent out from  Jibuti.                                    ARABIA. HEJAZ.     Relations of King Hussein with other Arab Chiefs.- Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the  Viceroy on the 23rd &quot;June  [P. 2502] that the assistance of His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment had been asked by King Hussein to induce  Ibn Saud  and Idrisi to recognise his position as leader of the  Arab  movement,  without any infringement of their inde- pendence, rights, or liberty, and it was anxious to strengthen, by all legitimate  means, King Husseiifs position among his fellow-Arabs.   Mr. Chamberlain asked whether the resident at Aden thought that it would  be  possible  to persuade Idrisi  to send some message to the King of Hejaz which could fairly be regarded by  the latter as meeting his wishes, it being made quite clear to  the  former that there  was no  question of the surrender  of&apos; his  sovereignty.   This telegram  was  repeated to  the  resident, who telegraphed on the following day [393 A. P.] that Mustafa-al-Iclrisi was leaving. imme- diately for Jaizan.   The resident  was asking that Mustafa might be sent from Egypt to Aden first, and he would  then send Major  Reilly with him to Jaizan to  endeavour to procure the acceptance of the proposal by Idrisi.     Proposed Italian Go-operation. Mr. Balfour telegraphed  to Sir R.  Rodd  on the 23rd June [No.  1209J  informing him  that he  was  being  pressed  by the  Italian Ambassador to accept military co-operation in Hejaz from  Italy.  French co-operation had been confined to a small mission of officers.   It  was  desirable  that the King of Hejaz should carry out any future operations without  the  assistance of foreign  troops : no French  or British troops were  being  sent  to him.   Mr.  Balfour hoped that  Baron Sonnino would not press the proposal in  the  circumstances.  Sir  R. Rodd telegraphed in reply on the  25th June  [No. 569] that he  did not think  the proposal would be pressed : he had spoken in  the sense  desired by Mr.  Balfour.  [Cf. Eastern  Report XV, p. 4, and XVI,  p.  7  (Proposed  Italian Mission  to  Hejaz); also VIII,  p.  11 (Italy and  Palestine).]                                    PERSIA     The Views of the Government of India on the Internal Condition of  Persia. TheViceroy telegraphed on  the 25th June saying that the Indian Government viewed  theprospect of a definitely hostile democratic Government or of anarchy with  the gravest concern, the more so that the present wave of democratic feeling seemed to be by far more widespread and more genuine than any of its predecessors.  The results of such a hostile  democratic Government or  of anarchy would  involve : (1) Our evacuation of
Shiraz at least;  (2) special measures  to secure the  Gulf ports ;  (3) a hostile  menace to the oilfields and Arabistan, thus threatening General Maude&apos;s communications andbase ; (4) the disintegration of the South Persia Rifles, on which our military position inSouth Persia depends; and (5) an open road to  Herat for the Turks, with  the probablespread of war to  the Indian frontier and Afghanistan.     Every effort should, in the opinion of the Indian Government, be made to  obviatesuch serious consequences by conciliating the de facto democratic  leaders, to which end that Government would not hesitate to reconsider  the August agreement or to scrapthe 1907 Convention.  In regard to the Rifles, the Indian Government thought thatwe should be prepared to discuss  a greater  measure of Persian control in the future,subject, so long as we pay, to the retention of British officers, but in the event of Persiaassuming responsibility after, the war not barring neutral officers.   It thought that weshould not press the question of joint financial control too strongly.  Mr. Schuster wasa persona grata with the democratic party, and the Indian Government  asked whetherit would  be out of the question to bring him back.  Any attempt to continue the  oldreactionary policy was obviously  doomed to failure  in Persia, and  elsewhere woulddiscredit us badly.     South Persian Rifles. Mr.  Chamberlain telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 20thJune that, in the light of Sir C.  Marling&apos;s telegrams  of  the 13th June [Eastern ReportXXI, p. 4], the question had  been carefully considered by the Cabinet, which, beforesending final orders, proposed to  await the receipt of Sir P. Sykes&apos;s provisional schemeof organisation.                                     INDIA.     The Mohmands. The Viceroy telegraphed on the  26th June that peace overtureswere being made  by the Mohmands, under pressure of  blockade,  and a settlement wasunder consideration.     The Swatis. In the same telegram the Viceroy reported that a four months&apos; trucehad been concluded between the Swatis and the Nawab of Dir.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.                                     TURKEY.    Eyoub Sabri. Sir W. Townley transmitted [No. 1823]  from The  Hague, on the26th June, a telegram from Dr. Frew to Sir M. de Bunsen, sent through the  DutchMinister at Constantinople.   Dr. Frew  repeats what was  said  in  Sir&apos; W. Townley&apos;s&quot;telegram of the 16th June [Eastern Beport XXI, p. 2] as to reprisals  being taken ifEyoub Sarbi were not released, with the  addition  that the Porte believed that the lastnamed had been badly treated.  In reply Mr.  Balfour telegraphed to Sir W. Townley[No. 1722] telling him that in April last instructions had been given to the Governor of malta that Eyoub Sabri should be treated with special leniency, and at the beginning ofMay the Governor had  reported that Sabri had stated that he did not want  anything,being quite comfortable.   It  was understood that he was about to write to UnitedStates Ambassador at Constantinople  on the  subject  of his favourable  treatment, andMr. Balfour could not understand what reason there could  be  for reprisals on Britishsubjects, or why the Porte asserted that Sabri had  been badly treated.PRWTBD A.T THE WOJOtl&amp;V OFITICK BT 0.

                         ARABIA.                           Hejaz.                      A  Year  of Revolt.     The 9th Shaaban, which falls this year on May 30, is the anniversary of Emir Husein&apos;s definite rupture with the Turks.His standard indeed, had been  raised  four  days earlier  outsideMedina  by his sons, Ali and  Feisal ; but the  9th  Shaaban,which heard the first shots fired at Mecca and Jiddah, has beenadopted  as the official Day of independence.  On  this occasion the following telegram has been sent by the  High commissioner of Egypt to King Husein : &quot; On  this fortunate 9th Shaaban, onwhich day, last year, Your Majesty&apos;s troops victoriously took thefield at Mecca and Jiddah, I beg to offer Your Majesty my cordialcongratulations on the completion of a first year of liberty and my  sincere  hopes  that  the  years  to come may  be  equallyfortunate for your Majesty and  the Arab Nation.&quot;     The outbreak of  the Hejaz Revolt, as  is well known, waspremature.  The original plan was  for  August, but the Emir&apos;shand was forced by the appearance  in Medina of a  picked  bodyof  3,000  Turks,  destined to  escort  the   Stotzingen  Mission.Neither  he  nor  we were at all  ready in   early   June,  1916,and it was only with the greatest difficulty  that a minimum of sufficient assistance in material could  be  scraped  together  toensure initial  success.   But for the prompt  co-operation of theSirdar, who  sent  indispensable  artillery from Khartum, and ofthe S.N.O., lied Sea Patrol, both Jiddah and Mecca might havedefied attack  for  long enough ; nor would  Taif have  fallen intime for the Pilgrimage in early October.     The comparative  ease  with  which  early  successes  overconsiderable bodies of trained troops in fortified positions  were obtained, was, of  course, due to  the isolation of the  Turks in southern Hejaz,  some 300 miles from any base connected by adecent system  of  communication  with  the rest of the  Empire,and also to their  very inadequate equipment of munitions andother supplies.  If there  existed any misconception about thesesuccesses, it  was  soon  to be corrected by  what  happened  atQunfudah, at Medina, and on  the-Darb es-Sultani.   That the hejaz  Bedouins were simply querrileros, and not of good qualityat that, had been  amply demonstrated,  even  in the early sieges ;and it was  never  in doubt  that  they would  not  attack  orwithstand  Turkish  regulars  unless  these   were  at  the lastextremity.  Our  efforts,  therefore,  have been directed, almostfrom  the first,  to finding, in  addition to  material assistance,some elements out of which  a  trained force could be formed.Syrian refugees, Arab prisoners of war, and a few  ex-Ottomansoldiers of Arab race were the only material which we could
supply, but only a small  proportion of  what seemed availablein these categories  proved ultimately of any service.  To it the hejaz  itself could add some  townsfolk,  Arab fellahin,  releasedprisoners  and the like.  In one  way or another, by the end ofthe year,  between two and three thousand partly  trained menunder  very heterogeneous  Moslem officers have been put into(he field ; but, distributed as they are among at least threedistinct armies, they are not yet  sufficient to solve the problems which   Medina, with  its  outposts  and  railway  line of com-munications,  presents.  More such  material,  however,  is beingsteadily recruited, the pace having notably quickened since thevindication of British arms by the capture of Baghdad.    We reach, therefore, the  end of the year  with Medina  andthe Hejaz Railway still held by the Turks, together with the posts  of Bir el-Mashi (about thirty miles to the south-south-westat the  bifurcation of  the Gaha  and Fura roads)   and  Manjur(some fifteen miles south-west on the  Sultani Road).  Medinaitself  has been evacuated  by at least half its civil population andis very short of food, none apparently  being put into it by therailway, though this is still intermittently open.   The latter hasbeen  greatly weakened as a means of communication,  both  bydamage to  the permanent way, now  repaired in  many  placeswith  defective material, and by  the deterioration of  the rolling stock.   But  no  station has yet  been  taken  and   held  by  theArabs, and  such a stoppage of traffic, as a trained  force astride the line could ensure, has never been,  brought about.  All therest  of  the  Hejaz,  including Midian with  its  immediatehinterland, acknowledges  King  Husein, and  his  is the only effective government  in it.   But,  so long as Medina  remainslinked up with the rest of the Ottoman Empire, and the Turkshold the  heads of&apos;the three coast-roads  towards Mecca, not onlyhas the immediate end of the Revolt  not been wholly gained,but it cannot be said  to be impossible  for the  enemy to retrievethe whole province.  Had the Hejaz Expeditionai-y Force formedlast autumn  a Hying  column  of  the old pre-Turco-german typeunder  a  dashing commander, it might well  have  re-occupiedMecca  for a  time  at  any rate,  for the Ai*abs  could not havestopped it by themselves, and would  probably  have called  forthe assistance of foreign troops too late.  What was possible thenis still not quite out of  the question, should  the railway remainin being, and the Turks succeed in reinforcing and re-provisioningtheir  Expeditionary Force by next autumn.  At present however,this Force undoubtedly  has  not the man-power, the transport,the munitions or the  morale  to  do  more than just  hold its  ownin place.

                         Intelligence.    King Husein is  sending back  the  Amarat messengers withreplies to  Ibn Hadbxlhal and Ibn Mijlad, in which he states thatthe Arabs and the British are  one and urges  all  the former torender the  latter  every  assistance  in their power.   He desired that Colonel  Wilson  should add similar  letters under his ownhand, but instructions were sent to the latter  not to  comply, it being doubtful what  construction  might be put by  independentArabs  on such statements and  exhortations signed by a british representative.    From more than  one source we have  been,  informed that theBurks  are reinforcing the artillery of their Hejaz  ExpeditionaryForce,  which  suffered rather  severely  at Bir  el-Mashi.  It ishoped  that  operations against  the railway may,  at  least, delaythese reinforcements.   On May 16 one of our planes flew overel-Ala  and bombed the station buildings and also a freight-train,which  started for the south on seeing  its danger.   The enemygarrison   appeared  to have decreased  since the  end of  April.Spasmodic  raids  on  the line continue  in   the  Muadlidhamneighbourhood and. the  eneffry is reported to be running short ofrails, bolts, nuts, etc.  We are informed,  that the 129th Regiment,after being depleted to make up the companies ol two battalions of the 55th  which remain at Bir el-Mashi, lias been  withdrawnnorth  to guard  the railway.   Colonel  JNewcombe,  who  hascontinued to  encounter  great  difficulties with his  following ofBedouins and  Bishawa in prosecuting  attacks on the line, hasbeen to Jiddah and to Cairo.   Colonel  Wilson has gone to Wejhto decide  the question of transferring the R.F.C. flight to Yambo.If  the transference is ma.de, it is hoped  to establish an advanceflying  base  at Bir  Abbas, and   a  landing   ground  near  Birel-Mashi ; but it is  very doubtful whether  communication bycar can be established between  the former and Yambo.   [Lateradvices state  that, for  the present,  the  flight  will  remain atWejh.]     Some  useful information has been given by Ramadan Eff.,an Arab Officer, who deserted about May 3 from  near Medina.He was O.C. Camel Corps  there, and had been much trusted  byFakhri Pasha.  He is a .Bedu by birth, from Deir el-Zor district,his father  being  a sheikh.  He and his brother,  with sons ofother Bedu  sheikhs,  were educated  at  the Stambul  MilitarySchool.(1). Turkish Forces.     55th Regiment.

The  regiment is divided and forms escort to guns or makes posts at the above places.     Half tabur at Hafira.     In all nine battalions, but one quarter  of  these  are  Arab troops, taken  from  an  Arab  regiment  which-  was  split  up amongst  Turkish troops; the  average fighting men  of  these battalions would not be much above  500.   Each battalion has 20 to 30 hamla camels ; otherwise there are no camels available.     Only  one tatur went  north  during April, or  for  the last three or  four  months, i.e. 129th with aeroplanes.  The Camel Corps  consists of 350  men (from  Nablus  and Gaza) and is at Bir Ali and  Bir el-Mashi.   With them are four mountain guns and four  machine  guns.  The Takruris in Medina have been dissolved.   There  is  one  company   of  mouuted  men  with 120 nudes at Medina, or outside.     There is no  food for animals, so officers  have sold  their horses.   Last month sufficient food for men  arrived, and  there may be four  to six months&apos;  rations  available.    Fakhri Pasha will never surrender,  nor will the men while he is there; but probably they would, it  he were not  present.   Big  guns in the hands  of  Arabs  are the main requirement  to  dishearten  and disturb the Turks.     Fuller details of local interest, including desertePs ideas for taking Medina, were given to Sherif Ali. 2.   Syria.     Ramadan  Eff. had  had  leave to  go  to  Deir el-Zor,  and returned   via  Aleppo,   Damascus,  etc.,  about six weeks ago.The railway was not particularly guarded north  of  Kayak, and bridges have only small gendarmerie guards.   There is a divisionat  Alexandretta,  but  no big force at Aleppo,  except troopspassing through.  There is  a division in the Lebanon, underRafaat Bey,  who had  a division at the Canal attack,  February1915 ?  Practically no  troops are at Damascus, but one reginnentis at Deraa, watching the Druses.   They have no camels or horses
at Deraa, except for the gendarmerie.   Between Deraa and Maariare no troops except the Railway battalion, and it should as easy to cut the line there as near Medain Salih, since tire Beni Sakhrare very strong and anti-Turk.  At  Maan were two alai whenhe passed through, but these had been sent to Gaza a month ago,and  he  believed  one  company  of   cavalry.   Two companiesinfantry were the onhy troops left.   The hospital at Maan is full ;all  Medina sick are sent there ;  and large numbers have gonefrom  Fakhrfs army.   At  Tebuk  were  300 men with mules ;these  were  moved to  Medain Saleh, then back to Tebuk, thenagain to Medain  where  he believes are their present headquarters.Tebuk had, otherwise, practically no  troops.  Kamel Eff. (fromTarablus el-Gharb), was CO. a  very dark man  and  pro-Turk.Another lot of about 300 mules has lately come under Selim Bey.There are a good many troops at Medain and el-Ula, but he hadno  details.  Jemal Pasha was G.O.C.   He is  from Ismid,  anclnot to be mixed up with the two original Jemals of Syrian fame.Mohammed Bey, his staff officer, is Arab and  pro-Sherif.   TheAgeyl, or  Camel Corps, from  Wejh still  continues  at el-Ulaunder Yuzb.  Bakri Bey with about 150 hagios ; but other threedeserters lately arrived from el-Ula on their camels say they left the other  half of  the  force,  consisting now of 300,  at el-Ula.Miralai Salaheddin Bey is staff officer to Fakhri Pasha, but  veryunfriendly to the latter.3.  General.     People in Medina, perdiaps  20,000, have no  food, or verylittle.  Every railway  station receives a month&apos;s rations monthly,but no bigger reserve.     He believes there are  10,000  or more deserters  in JebelDruse and large  numbers  at Nablus ; his conversation on theprospects  of successful action   north  of  Maan  were  most encouraging, including his belief  that  the  Turks would not  beable  to enter the  Beni Sakhr country easily, if the latter rose.The Turks are not hard up for food,  he thinks,  owing to the newexemption law by which pajunents are made in kind.    As regards the situation along the northern  sections of therailway, we  are  informed,  under date  May  25,  that  the  BeniAtiyah  have occupied Ram (or Imram), an  important  point about fifty miles  east of Akaba, and  that  the Amran section ofthe Huweitat, under Ibn  Jazi, is  prepared to co-operate withthem in attacking posts along the Akaba-Maan road.   The BeniAtiyah  are said to have made a raid of their own on  the troops(labour corps ?) in the Wadi Ethil,  south  of Tebuk, and to have captured a Yuzbashi and ten men.    On  May 13 and 14,  Sherif  Sharraf,  with whom  wasLieutenant H. S.  Hornby, made two raids  near Muadhdham.  In
the first a great deal of explosive Avas wasted, but some forty-eight rails were destroyed, and  the enemy reliefs, which arrived from  Muadhdham and Khishm Sana, suffered al together a loss often killed and  twenty-five prisoners.   In the second raid, north of Muadhdham, thirty-three rails and the  telegraph lines  Averedestroyed.    Lieutenant Hornby&apos;s report  on  these operationsemphasizes again the indiscipline and  carelessness of the Arabs,as well as the ease and security with which such raids, if properlymanaged, can be carried out.  He notes the presence of&apos; muchmore  water  (mainly in large rock-pools)  in   the  hills to thesouth-west and south of Muadhdham than we had previouslyany idea of.                           Yemen.                     The Aeiv Movement.     We have already called attention to the growing anti-Turkmovement in Yemen (see  expansion.  p.  245  and references  quotedthere).   Since  it appears  to  be unusually  widespread, to  berooted in national sentiment, and to have a definite programme and serious  plans for putting  it into execution, it will be timelyto circulate more information about its chief leaders and their aims.     The leaders have- put forward a member of the  Qasim houseof Sanaa,  in  the direct  fiassite  line, to be proclaimed Imam ofSanaa in  place  of  Yahya.   To  the  latter they  threaten  nophysical  violence ;  but  his  throne and property  are  to  beconfiscated, and the Shebara branch of the Qasim house is to  besuperseded, because  of  the unpatriotic attitude maintained since1911  by Yahya &quot; ibn el-Mansur,&quot; the reigning Imam.    Such isthe profession of the leaders, and we may take it to be sincere,despite indications that a more  intimate motive has been supplied by  the  stinginess and remissness of Yahya in dealing out to thefeudatory  chiefs their stipulated money allowances.    The proposed candidate, Seyyid Mohammed el-Qasim, seemsto be himself of  no fame, but  to be the son of a better knownscion  of  the  Qasim  house, one  Yahya, who  has been hithertoin receipt  of  a Turkish pension.   The son has been described tous as a nephew of the reigning  Imam.  If so, he must be a son of a sister of  the latter ;  since  two brothers would not have  thesame  name.   But  it  is more likely that  some distant cousinshipis the real relation  (this is actually stated  to be so  by  theheadman of Seyyid Mobammed&apos;s deputation to Aden).    The genealogy reported to us continues &quot;ibn el-Hadi ibn  el-Muavyad  billah ibu  el-Qasim.&quot;   El-Hadi has been a personaltitle&apos; borne by several  Imams, and  most lately by the ImamMohammed in the early forties of  last  century.   It is  possible(though the interval is rather long)  that the present candidate is
the latter&apos;s grandson  (Moslems, it  must be remembered,  oftenbeget sons in  old  age:  the present King of Hejaz is grandsonof the Emir put in by  Mohammed Ali in  1827).  The rest ofthe  genealogy  does not fit  the  immediate ascendants of  the imam Mohammed  el-Hadi ; but it looks very much as if severalgenerations bad been skipped and the el-Muayyad intended is the imam of that name who was  son of the Imam Qasim, the first ofthe Saadah rulers who established himself in Sanaa, and becameprince of all  Yemen,  in  the  seventeenth century,  after  thewithdrawal of  the  original Turkish conquerors.   This genealogygives a very distinctly nationalist and  anti-Turk colour to  the-movement, basing, as it  does, the  SeyyicVs claim on Imams whoall  ruled before 1849, when  the first Imamic submission  to  theTurks was made.     Seyyid Mohammed, styling himself  President of  the Ulemaand the Sherifial.  League  of Yemen, has  written  under date,April 27, to the Resident, Aden, reminding him of negotiationsproposed  on  his own behalf  eight months ago  by Nakib Yahyaesh-Shaif through Kaid Ahmed of Hajariyah (one of  the borderchieftains now  in active revolt against the Turks on the Yemenborder).  Seyyid  Mohammed says he has all the Yemen  ulemaand sherifs in his hand, and that all the Bekil chiefs from Baratup  to  Nejran have agreed  with  him.  He now sends to the resident, two akils of the Hashid, Ali  Mohsin el-Useimi and AliMohsin  el-Kharmi.  His reference to our King is interesting:-     &quot; We are aware of  the power which the representative of theChrist may the blessing of God be unto him possesses on land and sea.&quot;  He appended a complimentary letter  to be forwarded to  His  Majesty himself.   The exordium is  truly remarkable.:      &quot; To  the  benevolent  King,  the  Magnificent Monarch,  thegreat  Sovereign,  the  honourable  Emperor  of the  Christiannations, the  kindest  King over the followers of Jesus, He  who was  submerged in the baptismal water, He who drags the  tailsof  respectfulness, and  veneration   (with   him),   He   whose veneration is dreaded by. the inhabitants  of the land and  sea, He whose  administration is  longed  for by cities  and kingdoms, the brave lion, the magnanimous lion, the King of the English, the pure gold.&quot;      The other reported leaders-of the Movement fall into three categories. I. Chiefs of the Ind pendent Hinterland.      These include the  ruling Sherifs of Behan  and Mareb, who have  both written letters, the  one to the Resident, Aden, the other to Colonel  Jacob.   Sherif  Ahmed Mohsin of  Behan (the last tract of  fertility down  the Wadi Behan  before it enters the south-west corner of  the  Great Desert) is a well known, if remote, friend of ours, an  old and crafty man, who signed the
 Aden  Pact in  1903.  Like  the  Sherif&apos; of  Mareb  (some eighty miles to the north), he habitually takes our side from fear of the nearer Turkish menace.   Between these two sherifs, and hostile to both, lies Harib, whose ruler does not appear in this movement. Neither Behan nor Mareb has seen much of Europeans, and the latter, the  ancient  Sabaean  capital and site of the great dam of Queen Balkis, whose bursting is one of the  landmarks of  ancient Arabian history, has been visited only by  Arnaucl, Halevy, and Glaser  (the  last under  Turkish escort in  1889).  Wavell  was headed off  in  his  attempt  to reach  it in  1911.   Sherif Abdurrahman makes an interesting  reference to this Dam in his letter  to  Colonel  Jacob: &quot; We are making some excavations in the Dam and are rebuilding some other portions.&quot;     The  Behan Sherifs letter, elated April 8, contains nothing of  particular  interest  beyond the statement that he has had a meeting with  the  Nakib  Yahya  esh-Shaif, on  whose great influence he insists, at Mareb on March 27,  and  there  and  then agreed  on a policy.   He says lie had offered previously to  fight with  and  for  us  at Aden itself.  The  Mareb Sherif, dating on March 24,  also mentions the Nakib as his  counsellor.  He is less cordial  in  tone than the  Behan Sherif, and  takes  occasion to say that the  ruling Imam  Yahya is  his relation and friend.   He evidently  thmks  we are in treaty  with the latter ; but  though chiding us for oursecretiveness, he promises to do our bidding, if we will tell him what  we desire. II. Chiefs of Central  Highland Tribes.     Some  seven chiefs  have  written, five of them signing one letter.   The most important, the Nakib  Yahya  esh-Shaif,  who has been in correspondence with Idrisi, and professes to speak for all the  Bekil, wrote separately from Mareb to  Colonel Jacob, under date March  29, saying he had sent his  son  to Taiz to get money and, evidently,  also to confer with the Hajariyah rebels under  Raid Ahmed (son of  Ahmed Naaman?).   He  offers to go, if desired by us, to Hadhramaut.   The  other chiefs  merely introduce  themselves through  tbe  Hashicli akils  sent to Aden, and mention other great  chiefs of Hashid, Bekil, Hamclan, Bilad Sharifiyin,  Ahnum, and  Bilad Dhuleima  as being in agreement with themselves, and especially Nasir Mabkhut el-Ahmar of the Himran Hashicl, Hizam es-Saar  of the Amran  Bekil, and Ali Miqdad of  the An is.  All these are well known to us.   The last, now about fifty,  fought with the  Imam  in  1911,  and  took prisoner the  Kaimmmakain   of  Doran.    Since  last  summer,however, he  has been  at odds with  his  suzerain.   He is  very powerful in the southern Highlands. III. Notables  of  Central and Southern  Yemen.     Of these the most important are Sherif Abdullah ecl-Dumein, one of  the best of the ruling Imanfs lieutenants, who  carried the Emir   of Mecca&apos;s  messages  to  Yemen, and  was in Aden
before the  war ;  and  Kaid  Ahmed  of  Hajariyah,  already mentioned  as  having- been  in tbe field against the Turks forsome time.   Is he the son of  Ahmed Naaman who, before  thelatter&apos;s death in .1915, was A.D.C. to Ali Said  Bey (now Pasha)when the latter was at Taiz ?                           -  . :   .  The general plan of  these leaders is to deal, with  the Turkishoccupying  forces,  first  in  the Aden  Protectorate,  secondly inYemen itself,  if we will  give them material assistance (they askfor no other).  Presumably they will  proclaim  their new ImamMohammed at the outset,  but it is  not quite clear. whether  alocus poenitentiae will or will not  be allowed  to  the presentImam Yahya.   If all is true, that the Naqib Yahya esh-Shaif (whoseems to be the  soul of the movement) and the, others assertthe  forces  behind this movement are  very considerable.   they include,  first,&apos; the  bulk of  the  fighting  tribes of  the   EastYemen  Hinterland, which  the Turks  have never been able tosubdue j  second, the largest tribal units of the Central Highlands.which have always supplied the backbone of the most successfulrisings ;  third, southern  border elements already in active revolt.With the Turks short of both  money  and munitions and unableto reinforce their garrisons, not only ought  the first successes of1904 and 1911 to be repeated, but the setbacks which followedthese should not occur again.                                                D. G. H.                       ABYSSINIA.                   Summary of Intelligence.    News  from Abyssinia shows that up  to  the  last week  inApril the  general  situation  was  continuing  to  improve.   Therevolt in Negus Waldo Giorgis&apos; northern  provinces seemed  tohave collapsed  and Eas Seyyum,  of  Tigre, who was reported,in  our  No.  50,  to be on  his way  to  meet Pas  Taffari,had reached  Dessie.    This  destroys   any   possibility  of  a combination between  the northern provinces and Lij Yasu, ancldoes away  with - the  danger of  a rising in  Tigre  against theCentral  Government.    The internal  position in Tigre  itself is complicated by thefact that Has Seyyum is supported by only half  the population,his personal  enemies, Dejaz Guksa  and Dejaz  Gabri Selassi,exercising  considerable  influence  over  tbe  rest.  Tbe result isthat the province  is in a state of perpetual  unrest, which canonly be  ended  by the nomination  of  a chief  who  would  be acceptable to the whole  of the country.   Such a  man is only tobe found in the person  of Dejaz  Guksa, who,  like Pas  Seyyum,is a grandson  of  the Emperor John  and,  as  such, has  stronghereditary  claims  on  Tigre.  His popularity  there  however,  is,the reason for Pas Taffari&apos;s hesitation  to appoint him, lest a united Tigre might prove too independent of control.  The final
decision about the appointment will be delayed  until the resultof the expedition against Lij Yasu is determined.   This oughtto be  very soon, and  it  must  be admitted that the issue  is extremely doubtful.   Owing to the  lack  of foodstuffs in thedistrict, it will  be  impossible  for  the  Shoan troops to remainmore than  a  week  before  Magdala.   Success or  failure willprobably be  determined in  a  single  day  by a resolute attack by every available man.   Fitaurari ITapta Giorgis admits that, if hefails, he will be obliged to  return to Aclis  Abeba, leaving only  asufficient force  to  watch  the fortress  during the rainy season.He realizes that it is not in an  attack on an almost impregnableposition  that   Abyssinian  troops  are at their  best.   Brave  torecklessness  when they can face their enemy and attack with thesword, it is  doubtful  if  they have the  cold  courage or the discipline necessary to enable them to  scale successfully narrowmountain paths in the face  of an  avalanche  of rocks and  longrange fire.   The Fitaurari is hoping that  Lij Yasu&apos;s troops willdesert  him (as Fitaurari Woubie has  already done), on  hearing of the  approach of a strong  force,  or that  Lij Yasu  himself will show his habitual cowardice and try to escape alone.   Either  ofthese solutions is quite possible now that Bas Seyyum has come in and all support from him is out of  the question.   There is indeed a  rumour that Lij  Yasu  has already fled, but  nobodyknows for certain.     Ras Hailu of Gojjam  is being detained in Aclis  Abeba untilthe fate of Lij Yasu is settled-not that there is any special reasonto doubt his good  faith, but merely as  a  precautionary  measure in accord with the policy  of suspicion  which every  Abyssinianruler seems  bound to follow.  .     From  the British point of view, owing to its possible effecton our Somali frontier,  perhaps the most  disquieting element inAbyssinian  politics  at  present is   the  unrest  reigning in the ogaden country.  One iJejaz Keclani, formerly  outlawed by LijYasu, but subsequently restored to favour  on account, probably,of his Moslem sympathies, was arrested after  the Revolution, butallowed  to  escape. He fled  to the Ogaden  country and placedhimself at the  head of a band of some  two or three thousanddiscontented Abyssinians.   His presence at Dagabur is a menace to the peace of Harrar and an expedition against him is believed to be a necessity ; but any force which is sent must count on his being  supported by  the  Ogaden  Somalis, who would certainlyrise  to protect themselves against the looting of the Abyssiniansoldiery.  The main road  to Dagabur is through  Jig-jigga, thecountry of the Darod tribes, who were very severely handled bythe Abyssinians after the revolution and have only recently been persuaded to settle  down.  The approach of an expedition wouldcertainly frighten them into deserting their villages, and if lootingtook place, the)&apos; would rise and join the Ogaden in resisting theGovernment.    Nevertheless, an  expedition  appears inevitable,
since Kedani is drawing to himself all the discontented elements of the province and, being  a supporter of Lij Yasu, is a seriousmenace.   If  the  expedition  advances  by another  route, or  iflooting  could be  restrained and safety guaranteed to the Darods,the  trouble  might  be localized; but no chief has  sufficientinfluence  to  prevent his troops  from looting  even a  friendlycountry through which they may be passing.  Recently, DejazBalcha,  one of the  strongest  of  the  chiefs, had  to abandon an expedition he had been  ordered  to  make,  because his troopsrefused  to  go into  country  which   did  not  offer  sufficientopportunities for  loot.  The authority of the feudal  chiefs is fastdecaying and the old system of military service by feudal tenureis obviously worn out.     The soldiers  are beginning to recognize their own power, and,unless the relaxation  of discipline is checked, the)7 will some dayrender the  administration of  any government impossible.   Abreath of  the wind now blowing  over our European civilizationseems to have reached  Abyssinia.   Nobody  will do what  he istold.   An officer recently returned from  Abyssinia informs us that: &quot; Even those who are condemned  to be  hanged refuse toobey the  sentence.   Twenty-seven  men  were  recently  socondemned for the  murder of a  big  chief in Adis Abeba,  andwere led  to  the  usual  tree  in tbe  market-place.   Here  theyprotested  indignantly against  the proposed hanging, and walkedoff amid the cheers of the executioners and the crowd.&quot;                          NOTES.Ajeimi Saadun.     As was indicated  in our last issue (p. 231), the attitude ofthis  important  (though not  for the moment very  powerful)Muntafiq chief has been undergoing  a change since his letter toIbn  Saud,  quoted in our No. 4-1, p. 119.  Nearly two months ago  he seems  to have  drawn closer to Fahad  ibn  Hadhdhal  and finally to  have thrown in his  Jot,  for  the present,  with  theAmarat chief, with whom, according  to I.E.F. &quot;D&quot; Intelligenceof April 4, be went off from  Samawah.  The fact of  his beingwith Fahad was confirmed by the  authority of Sir Percy Cox ;and  news  of  it had  reached  Sherif Feisal  early in  May.   Itaccounts,  of  course, for the presence of  a friendly  letter fromAjeimi in the same  Hejaz  bag as those from the Amarat chiefs(see p. 231).  The latter (like Ajeimi too, for that matter)  arenow face  to face with  the  possibility, even  probability, that all their considerable  Euphratean  lands,  with   the  water  supplynecessary  to their fertility, will  be controlled in  the future bythe  British.   Fahad attaches  great  importance  to  his  palm-gardens at Ghazazah,  near Kerbela, and Baghdadiyah, near Hit,and  we shall hold  him and  his Amarat more  firmly through hismaterial interests, than by any sentimental tie.
Wejh Map (Provisional Sheet).     It is to  be regretted  that  we were obliged  to publish, inour Nos. 50, 51, Captain Lawrence&apos;s detailed and intricate route-reports without any  accompanying  chart;  but  his sketch-mapdid not accompany the reports, and was so long delayed that  webegan to fear  it lost.  It has, however,  now come to hand,  andbeen re-drafted at the Survey of Egypt, for inclusion in the revisededition of the Wejh  1:500,000  Provisional Sheet,  now in activepreparation.   This will embody  also Colonel Newcombe&apos;s route-traverses from Wejh to Muadhdham, and the excellent chart of thelower basin of  Wadi Hamdh from Wejh to Ugla (Akila), furnished by the R.F.C.  from observations taken both by flying officers andthose who have gone up with motor-cars.  The last report from thelatter shows that, where  sand and -brushwood  become thick, theCrossley  tender can progress where the Ford cannot.     This fresh material will greatly  improve the sheet, not onlyfilling in several areas which were sketchy or blank, but altering the positions  assigned to the railway  and  to  several importantroad-stations.   It will leave, however, a considerable blank area between the Wadi Hamdh and Colonel Newcombe&apos;s routes,  andwill not alter either the northern plotting, which must still dependon Burton&apos;s chart, or that of the region east of the railway.   Forthe  latter, however,  we  have hopes from  the re-plotting ofHuber&apos;s  data, which, we  are informed,  has been  carried  outrecently  with  great care  by R.G-.S. draftsmen under the super-vision of Mr. Douglas  Carruthers.   The latter  has been  re-considering also Gruarmanfs route-notes, and has supplied  us withan English translation of the Netjed Settentrioncde (with valuableintroduction),  which  the Arab  I3ureau proposes to  issue in  thesame form  as  Raunkiaer&apos;s book, issued last  year.

                      ARAB   LEGION.      One of the greatest difficulties encountered, in dealing with the  Arab movement has  been the lack of  cohesion among the Arabs  themselves, divided as  they are by  jealousies ancl tribal feuds;  whilst the  different  temperaments  of  the  elements comprising the Arab peoples militate against a wholehearted and cohesive  effort on their  part  against the  Turks.  Lengthy, yet essential  negotiations between  the  Sherifs  sons and some  of even the  smaller chiefs have meant  long delays  in military operations ;  local,  animosities and  grievances  have to be  settled before those affected  by them Avill  participate.  The Syrian, from the  height  of his education  and &quot; refinement&quot; looks down on the Beduin  in his &quot; dirt and  sand &quot;  as being beyond real  con- sideration, while the Beduin in his turn despises the effeminacy of tbe Syrian.   There are several other causes, like the above  of a   political  nature,   which tend to make the  Arab  movement somewhat spasmodic  and inharmonious, while on the military side we have experienced  obstacles quite as great.   The Bedouin forces have been proved incapable of either attacking, or withstanding an attack from, disciplined troops, and the successes they have so far  achieved, if we  except the  capture  of Taif,  which was completely isolated ancl  starved into submission, have been those of a, guerilla  nature; ancl although the military  situation  has frequently  demanded decisive  action, this has not  been forth- coming  through   lack   of  the   most  elementary   disciplined behaviour.      In a political sense, therefore, they have lacked  in the past, and to a great  extent lack in the  present,  a policy clear  enough for  them all to grasp,  ancl idealistic enough to encourage them to forget their purely  local grievances and ambitions.   In a military sense, they  need the  support of  troops who will face a disciplined  attack in  defence, ancl  supply  the moral backing in their offensive  operations.     To  assist  in overcoming these difficulties and merely as an adjunct  to  other  endeavours in  the same direction, it has been proposed to form an  Arab Legion.     The  objects for  which it would be  formed may  be  summed up briefly as follows :      (1) Political object : To  form ancl consolidate  a  national spirit among the various Arab  elements  at present at variance in ideals and policy, and to create  among them in a practical manner the spirit of unity and  enthusiasm,  and  also, by  locating its training  camp   near  the headquarters  of  the   Franco-British Political  Mission, to enable those of Arab nationality  visiting the Mission to see  some  visible  sia;n  of the  efforts being: made ontheir  behalf.   (2) Military object: To form a well equipped,disciplined body that can be relied on  to fight keenly, to stiffenthe  Sherifian  forces  in their  operations  against the  turkish troops, to act as a support to  irregular  operations against  the.
enemy&apos;s  lines of  communications, or even, if sufficiently  welltrained, to be  employed  in part in co-operation with the british forces should occasion require.     The  operations in  which the Legion may take part would only be those in Arab countries, and tbe enemy they oppose, onlythe Turks and those fighting  with them  in  these  spheres.    Itwould  be officered by  Arab  officers  and  would fight under thenew Sherifian flag.   The organization would be that of the British battalion,  and its  training would  be supervised  by French andBritish advisory officers equally represented.     No limit has  been fixed for the size of the force, but, asrecruiting would be prosecuted in  a wide area,  it is hoped at theleast  to  form  a full battalion, while  there is a prospect, of  thematerial even for  a  full brigade being obtained.   This  material would be  obtained  from  volunteers from among the prisoners ofwar taken in the various fields of operations, and  levies from the yemen recruited in Aden.  Enrolment would not be confined toMohammedans ; it is hoped by incorporating Christian Arabs inthe  Legion to make it non-fanatical and so encourage the  idealof Christian and Moslem working together for the common weal,and to assist in carrying this ideal from association in war to theperiod of peace.   In  operations  in the  Hejaz, of course, theChristians would not be employed, but in any other sphere  the)&apos;would bear their part.     All preliminary arrangements have been made  for   the firstdouble company, for which officers and volunteers  have  actually been obtained.  These  arrangements  include, in addition to theordinary details of organization&apos;, a, compilation of  the disciplinaryrules and regulations, a glossary  of Arabic military terms and a purely Arabic drill book based on the British infantry training:    . Tbe  uniform  adopted would  be.that  of an Arab battalion ofthe Egyptian Army.     The  scheme has been sent forward for final  sanction by theWar Office, and it  will  be  possible to make an immediate start if and as soon as this is signified.                         ARABIA.                           Hejaz.                         Intelligence.     King Husein  replied as follows, on June 1, to the  telegramfrom the High Commissioner, quoted in our last issue :         &quot;To  H.E. The King&apos;s Representative in Egypt.     &quot; The good wishes  expressed  by Your  Excellency for thehappiness of the ruler of the Arab Nation move the  to  redoublemy thanks to  your person as well as  to  the government of  His
Majesty, and I pray heartily to  the Almighty that we may. erelong celebrate in common at our  anniversaries a true victory, andthat your Excellency may continue to enjoy health and attain allyour desires.                            &quot;(Signed):  Husein.&quot;     News comes from Wejh that on May 29 a force of 60 Turkswas cut up by Arabs near el-Matalli Station.  Ten were captured;the  rest  were killed (including   the officer commanding) orwounded and all their rifles  were taken.     Captain Stent returned to Wejh  from Yambo on May  28,after an expedition  to see if good communication by  motor carcould be obtained between Yambo and Bir Darwish or some otherplace in that neighbourhood, in the event of the  transference ofthe R.F.C. flight  to Yambo.  If such communication were found possible, hangars and an advanced base  would  be made,  fromwhich daily bombings of the Turkish positions could be under-taken.   He got as far as Kheif (say  30  to 35  miles) with  hismotor car, but was  there stopped by the rocky state of the  road,which   he  considers  quite  impossible for  cars  in its present condition.  He said, however, that if the hangars and necessary storescould be transported to Bir Darwish he would nevertheless establish an advanced post  there and be able to bomb the enemy&apos;s positions.The machines would fly up from Yambo, a distance of 90 miles, andthe personnel would be relieved every week or so.   Colonel Wilsonwrites that he is not satisfied that, with onhy camel communication,which would take three days, such a scheme vrould be reasonablysafe.  If a machine broke down  on the way it   might be verydifficult to take supplies to, and rescue the occupants ; also, BirDarwish is so close to  the  enemy position at Bir el Mashi  that even with a guard of Egyptian troops there would be nothing toprevent an enterprising  attack being made by the Turks on the advanced aerodrome.  He adds, however,  that  since,  owing tothe hard  nature of  the  ground at Bir Mashi, the Turks have only been able  to  construct  stone sangars  without dugouts orhead-cover, the effect of bombing, if only this could be arranged,would probably be enormous and might well lead to the surrender of Fakhri and his forces.    In  the event of the removal of the flight to Yambo, with thesupply  ship &quot; El-Kahira,&quot; the water problem  at  Wejh  wouldbecome  difficult.  There  is  only one source of  drinking watersupply,  consisting of two  wells six miles inland,  from  which, as there is  no suitable  camping ground  in their  neighbourhood  forEgyptian  troops, water  must be  brought.   A   hundred camelwater tanks and four  filter water tanks would  therefore berequired and, in order to have a  second source of supply in  casethe wells ran out, tank storage up to sixty  tons would  also bewanted, this to be filled by ships which would themselves fill up from the Yambo condenser and discharge at Wejh.
     Large numbers of fugitives from Medina have been arriving at Yambo, e.g., a hundred families on May 30, about as many thefollowing day, and fifty persons  on June  1.  They  report  thatHaram has  been  turned into a magazine for arms and munitions.One case of cholera has occurred in Medina, the general sanitarycondition of which they report to be bad.   Fakhri Pasha is  saidto be resolved to hold out,  and  to have declared  that  he  would destroy the town rather than surrender it.  He is also stated tohave received reinforcements,  munitions and food  supplies.     Lieut.-Colonel Cadi,  who arrived on May 25 at the camp o Sherif  Ali,  estimates  that the  Turkish  forces   include threebattalions  at  Bir el-Mashi and  at Jelijla (on the Sultani Road,about eleven miles from Bir Dar wish),  two at Bir Ali (with  twoguns and two machine guns, and one at  Medina).  Ali himselfhas  three  machine-gun  companies, 1,000  regular and  2,000irregular infantry, without counting a large number of  Bedouins.     A report, dated  May  25,  from Bimbashi Garland,  of hiscontinued  operations  against   the  railway  is   rather  more satisfactory than its  predecessors in so far as it  shows that, at last, the O.C.  of the raiding parties is being given a certain voice in the conduct of affairs.   He had  been  working in the  neigh-bourhood  of  Mudharij   and   Toweira. and  lie   joined  SherifAbdullah at  Abu Marka on  May 22, after laying a few mines and  destroying  considerable  lengths of  the line,  but without having been able to  ascertain  definitely  the result of  his work.Scouts  sent out  did  not return.   Others sent to look for themreported, probably untruly, that  they had  found them with theirthroats  cut.   Others, again, refused  to  go at  all.   Such areBedouins.  The  trials of an energetic white officer obliged to depend on them  are indeed considerable.   Once, when  BimbashiGarland  was  laying  a  mine, the fuse  went off in  his hand,whereupon  the whole  part)7 bolted with but one  exception.  Hereports  favourably,  however,   of   Sheikh  Mohammed    AbuGhaneim and Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza,  who accompaniedhim.     He&apos;approached Abu  Marka from Faqeir, and  found tbe roadgood for cars all tbe way, but very inhospitable, without- water orcamel food.  He reports that Sherif Abdullah has two parties, one. of Hadiya, the other S. of Bueir, each of which is supposed tobreak 16 rails every night.  Abdullah believed that these parties had permanently stopped frame, and was greatly shocked to learnfrom  Bimbashi Garland that at least two trains had  passed withimafew days.   Bimbashi  Garland is  trying to induce  him to arrangefor raiding on  a more  intensive scale, on  a system  which hedescribes in detail, pointing out that oue long break is  preferable to two  short ones, which are probably repaired simultaneously.He is also  urging  Abdullah  to make up a demolition partyfrom  his  Syrian  soldiers and  to  put an  officer in  charge.Tbe  results of their raids would no doubt be more satisfactory and their reports of their doings less exaggerated, than those ofthe Bedouins,
    From  a letter  written a few  clays later it seems that thisscheme is progressing.  Bimbashi  Garland has begun training a class of Syrian soldiers who will go out as soon, as reliefs  can  besent by  Feisal.   He also  gave special instructions to  one. ofAbdullah&apos;s regular, parties  before  they went out and  saw thatthey took  double  the amount of  explosives  they had hitherto been taking.                            Nejd.                    Ibn Saudis Attitude.    King Husein stated, under date May 2, that Ibn  Saud  had said:  &quot; The  Turks  will not be beaten, ancl  we must consider them.&quot;   Accordingly, Husein full)7  credits reports, which  havereached us from time to time, that Ibn  Saud has been promoting the passage of Turkish consignments of specie to the Yemen bycircuitous routes.  Some weeks ago, on receiving such a report about a consignment of forty or fifty  thousand pounds (Turkish),Husein sent a message to Feihan  ibn Sumeil, Chief of the  Sbei,but the latter failed by  two  days  to intercept  the convoy at acertain well.   Now there is question  of a further  consignment,and the king  asserts that  a still more  easterly road  has  beenchosen, to secure safe passage by   which Ibn  Saud  wrote tosheikhs lying along it almost to Muscat.  These, according to his information,  have  lightened the  consignment by  some  sixthousand pounds ; but he does not tell  us whether the balance is  supposed to have arrived yet in Yemen.    In consequence  of all this news,  King Husein is  convincedthat Ibn Saud contemplates an attack on himself ancl some pro-Turk  treachery towards us.  He complains that the arms givenby us  to  Ibn  Saud have  been distributed  to  Wahabis (but towhom else should a Wahabite Emir  distribute  them ?), and hepresses us to  call  on  Ibn  Saud to  recognize his  (Husein&apos;s)paramountey a request  he had made already to Sir Mark Sykesat their recent meeting.    If it be true, as Sherifs  Abdullah  and Zeid have reportedvery recently to their brother Feisal, that Ibn  Rashid has  left for Medina or neighbourhood, Ibn saud has the chance of givingthe lie  to  all  these rumours by  attacking  Hail  behind  him.Failing that demonstration, we can only estimate their truth bya balance of probabilities ;  but  it must  not  be  assumed  hastilythat, even if Ibn Saud does not attack Hail now, these rumoursare well founded.  Our information about  Ibn  Rashicfs move-ments may not be credited  by him, or  may be actually false  :Ibn Rashid ma)&apos; have  left behind bim a sufficient force,  withTurkish artillery, to  maintain the status  quo  ante, i.e., the impossibility of attack  by Ibn Saud,  weak as he is in guns, asrecognized by  the Indian Government  and Sir  Percy  Cox  last
January.  Tt is true that the last  named expressed himself,  onMay 13. less inclined to urge caution on Ibn  Saud; but  he didnot suggest  that  tbe  latter&apos;s own  view had changed  or was likely to change.    Since the Kuweit  Durbar, Ibn  Saud has contented himself with consolidating his  power in Qasim, and if be has taken anyfurther action against Ibn Rashid it  has  been,  limited to writingletters to try and detach chiefs, like  Ajeimi  Saadun ; to  incitingtribesmen to close the Hail-Medina roads (we do not know what,if  an)7,  responsibility  Ibn  Saud had for the  tribal fightingmentioned on  p. 203) ; and, possibly,  to stopping contraband toand from Kuweit in  its passage  through Qasim.   His  relationsby correspondence with King  Husein  have  continued  in  a toneof civility ;  but  I on  Saud has  neither so addressed Husein as to imply  recognition, of his  paramountcy, nor has he ever sent  hisson or  any  of his followers  to co-operate  with the  Sherifianarmies.    Since his capture of Ibn Faraun&apos;s  camels last autumn (he did this only in obedience to  a  strong  representation  fromBasra), Ibn  Saud cannot be said to have taken, to our knowledge,any active measures against the Turks, except in so far as  hisappearance and utterances at Kuweit constituted such action.  Inthe meantime, King  Husein has accused  him more than  once ofamicable relations with the Turks ; e.g., in a letter dated April 9,Husein stated that  Ibn  Saud&apos;s  agent Abbas  el-Faliji,  who,according to  his  own  report, had left  Damascus  hurriedly, inOctober  1916, on hearing  of  the Ibn  Faraun  affair,  and  had refused to carry  Jemal&apos;s letters to  Ibn Saud,  had afterwardsreturned to Damascus to apologize on the latter&apos;s behalf and had brought to Riadh  forgiveness  and  presents from Jemal.   AlsoHusein has reported  negotiations of  uncertain issue between ibn saud and a party, including a son of  Sherif Ali Haidar, whichwas trying  to get through with  money to Yemen.   Needlessto add that, on  several  occasions,  inspired  Syrian and  Con-stautinopolitan papers have reported complete  agreement andco-operation between the Turks and  the Wahabite Emir.    There the matter stands.   Ibn  Saud desires undoubtedlyone thing above all  others his own sovereign independence inthe territories now subject  to him. which include Hasa ; and  hewould like to add  Jebel Shammar to these.  Just before the war(May,  1914)  he  was  prepared to  accept  a guarantee of  suchindependence  from the Turks,  but  as in the end  he got  nonesufficiently  satisfactory,  he turned back  to us.  He  signed atreaty  with  us in December 1915,  and in  virtue thereof  he has accepted arms and money.  But his  confidence has undoubtedly been disturbed by our preferential  treatment of King  Husein,with whose  pretensions  ueither his own political  ambition norhis religious sympathies are quite  compatible.   At the presentmoment his  mind can hardly fail to have been  agitated furtherby reports of the Russian situation,  and  of-the improved outlookof the  Turks on their northern and south-western Asiatic fronts.
     In view of the above  nets it is  not  altogether improbable tha,t  Ibn Saud  is &quot; trimming&quot; tO  the extent of refraining from all provocation of the Turks that is not forced  upon  him ;  but, seeing  how  essential  Hasa  is  to  him  and what is  our actual position in Mesopotamia,  it is not in the least likely that  he will affront us by attacking King Husein.  The latter, be it remarked, has an obvious motive in  trying to force our band in respect of Ibn  Saud, whose adhesion to himself he knows he will not secure except  through insistence on  our part ; and while  there is no proof of the statements on  which  Husein bases his conclusion, there are difficulties about some of them.   For  example,  accord- ing to other good information, all Ali Haidar&apos;s sons returned to Damascus with their  father, and  that easterly  route, making a detour  almost  to  Muscat, which the  last money consignment is represented  to  be taking,  is,  for  geographical  reasons, hardly credible.     Since the above was written, Sir Percy Cox lias telegraphed ? under date  June 6, discrediting  the report of  ibn   RashkTs departure from Hail, but stating that without doubt he has been approaching  Ibn Saud  with peace  proposals.    With  these  Ibn Saud reported  on May  .12  lie  had temporized, pending the reception of our views,  which he invited.   He  seemed, however, inclined to make  peace ;  and  desert  rumour says has  done so by now, Ibn  Rashid having restored certain horses which  he was detaining.  Baghdad is waiting further information, Ibn Hadhdhal (who  was at  Baghdad on  the date of  telegraphing)  having expressed himself incredulous of Ibn Rashicfs bona fides in the matter.  Of Ibn Saud&apos;s honour Baghdad  has  no doubt, and if Ibn  Rashid were prepared to  come  over to us, Sir Percy Cox counselled acceptance of him.   Finally, on June  11, a messenger from Ibn Saud reached  Basrah,  carrying to Sir Percy Cox copies of the correspondence between  the  two Emirs.   The purport of these letters, as telegraphed to  us, is  that Ibn Rashid proposed peace but refused to accept Ibn SaucTs terms, of which alliance with the British and with  the  King of the Hejaz  was an essential condition.  Ibn Sand now asks for  instructions  and for material help.  His attitude, therefore, is, so far as we know,  loyal,  ancl we must credit the report  received by Sherif Feisal, that he has declared publicly,  in Riadh and Bureidah,  that lie is a. friend of King Husein and will cut the  tongue out of anyone  heard speaking against the latter.  That  Ibn Rashid,  however, for his part,  has pushed  some  force  towards Medina is clear from  an information  given  by King Husein to the  effect that his  son Zeid, on some date unspecified, engaged a Rashidite party including some Turks, under Ibn Leilah ;  on its  way  from Mustajidclahtowards Medina, killed twenty-six, and captured  prisoners, a gun, three machine yuns, live stock and munitions.  Zeid himself lostthree killed.                                                  D.G.H.
                          NOTES.Money for Yemen.     In reference to the question  discussed on page 267 above, itis  worth noting that Aden has  reported,  under various  datesbetween May 15 and 24, rumours of the arrival of consignments of specie from Constantinople at Sanaa.     Kama ran stated on April  22,  that   35,000 in  notes  and 3,000 in gold  had so arrived, and on  June  6  Aden  reportedconfirmation of this news.   About  a month later two  Turkishofficers, who are said to have  brought  800 to  Lahej, reportedthat they  had been held up en  route  to Sanaa  by Ibn  Saud.Their consignment for Yemen is stated by a fairly reliable agentto be as high as  82,000 ;  but all  figures so reported  must bedistrusted.  The notes are said to exchange in  Yemen  for  halftheir face  value.   If so, it is difficult to see why Constantinopleshould trouble to send them so  far.   The vali of Yemen  mightas well fabricate  bis own post-bellum promises-to-pay on the spot.     Since the above has been in type, Aden has  forwarded, underdate June 2, a  statement  on. the subject, based on. informationgather-eel from Lahej.   From this it appears as if  30,000 wasthe total sum in cash  confided to  three parties  of six Turkishemissaries in all for transport to Yemen  ; and if (as seems certain),Eshrefs party was one  of these,  20,000 odd of that total neverreached its destination.   As for the balance, to  which has to beadded   30,000  in notes, it is not clear what proportion (if any)Avas brought to  Sanaa  by  the  two  Turkish officers  mentionedabove.   They secured their release from Ibn  Saud&apos;s  hands byappealing  to his  sense of hospitality and  Moslem  solidarity ; but whether all  or a part of their cash  was also released is not said.Of the third  party and  what: sum it carried, Lahej has no news.But it  passes on a  rumour  of a very large consignment  expectedthrough an  Oman port from Germany, which  may explain  thestatement made  by King Husein that Ibn saud had issued orders in regard  to roads  in the East of Arabia.  -(See above  page 267).The &quot;  clean-fighting  Turk.&quot;     Admirers of the clean-fighting   Turk may  profitably reflecton the  following examples of his military chivalry, reported bydeserters in the  Hejaz :      Suleiman ibn  Fadalla, of  Broussa,  states that  about five months ago, at  Medinet el-Haazal,  a Turkish  captain,  MahmudEffendi, when  on reconnaissance,  came upon  a flock  of  sheepguarded by two  Bedouins  and a girl, of  ten or twelve years  ofage. One Bedouin fled, but the other was killed and  his  headwas brought  into  camp.   The  girl  was also brought in- and shot, her head being then cut off and exposed  in the  middle ofthe  camp.
    Mohammed  Ali ibn Salih,  of  Aintab, states that all theBedouin prisoners taken in the fight at Bir Ali, whether woundedor not, were killed.    The next  day,  a  Turkish patrol  found aboy of thirteen  or  fourteen  hiding  inside the belly  of a deadcamel.   They pulled him out and beheaded him.   There were also  three  Bedouins in  a tent ;  during the night  they werebayonetted and left in a  dying  state, but as they lingered forthree days they were eventually  beheaded.    In  April,  at Bir el-Mashi,  eight  Bedouin  men  and twowomen leaving  Medina  were captured  and,  b)r  order  of AliSahib,  were  bound  and  exposed  to  the  sun all  day.   In the evening they were  taken outside  the   camp,  bayonetted,  andbeheaded.   One soldier,  who protested, was himself threatened with death.Evacuation of Akaba.    It  is  reported  from  Wejh,  under  date  June   1,  from information received by  Sherif Feisal, that there has been fightingat Akaba between Turks and Arabs,  resulting  in  the  evacuation of the place  by the Turks, who retired  to  Maan.  The road isstated to be clear from Akaba to Maan, except a. post  of twentymen at Gueira and a post at Fuweila ; though in  a confirmatoryreport from Tor of the same  date it is said that there were ten menstill at Jerf ei-Edeida (? near Jebel  Edoid,  NJ.W. of  Akaba)who were only  waiting for camels -to  remove  their kit.   ManyTurks were reported killed and six Arabs.  One camel  company of  100  men  deserted  from  the Turks,   joined the Arabs andfought the Turks when pursued by them.Syrian  Notes.    The  following  extract  from the  &quot; Iqbal&quot;  of  Beirut, of20  Regeb  last, is  of some interest  as indicating the  dearth ofwoven fabrics in Syria      &quot; One and a half million sacks of sand  are required for the  *fortress  of Gaza.    They  are wanted  for  the construction of defences against the infinite number of  projectiles shot at oursoldiers by the enemy.   These are continually  being suppliedthem  by their trains and fleet.  The sacks are to be used in fillingup the breaches made by enemy fire.   If necessary, all the silkcurtains and  screens in all the houses in Palestine and  Syria willbe  used for the purpose, and the sacks made from these  will beplaced before the defence lines of  Gaza on which the future of Syria and the Hejaz so largely depends.     &quot; One quarter of a million of these sacks  are to be  supplied by the Vilayet of  Adana, another quarter by the Mutessarrifateof  Jerusalem.  Half a million are  to be supplied by each of theVilayets of Aleppo, Beirut and Syria.
     &quot; We understand that the half-million to be supplied  by theVilayet of Beirut  will be distributed  thus : 100,000  to  Beirutand  400,000 to each of  the Mutessarrifates of Tripoli, Latakia,Acre and JSTablus.&quot;Aden News.     It appears that the old Fadhli Sultan has not been definitelydeposed   yet, but  is allowed by the  Akils  and  his  grandson,Sultan Abdul Qadir, on account of his great  age and  feebleness,to continue to reign on  sufferance,  on condition lie keeps out of relations with the Turks.   The Akils support Abdul.  Qadir, andthe Resident, Aden, has signified his  consent to the  continuance ofthe old  Sultan on the above understanding.     Further intelligence is to hand, under date June 2, of unrestin Yemen, but it seems to issue at present only in sporadic localfighting e.g., under Seyyid Mohammed  Darwish in the QatabaDistrict ;  also in Hajariyah and in Jebel Baclan ed-due in.  Weunderstand that no action is being taken by H.M.G-. in regard  tothe more  general  movement discussed in our last issue.
