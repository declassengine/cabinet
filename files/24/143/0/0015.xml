SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT, No.  XV.                                         RUSSIA.        DURING the last week the Provisional Government has passed  through a crisis, !  and, by obtaining the support of a  small majority of the delegates of the Petrograd ,  Committee of Soldiers and Workmen, it has survived.  Sir George Buchanan&apos;s telegram   No. 644, given in extenso in the Addenda to  this Report, gives a  very fairly complete   picture of the results upon the Government of the crisis and of the present situation in   Petrograd.   One notes with interest that, although M. Miliukoff nominally retains  the   portfolio of Minister for Foreign Affairs, his essential functions are to be performed by I  a committee of three members of the Government.  It would be interesting to know who \  the two other gentlemen are, and particularly whether Kerensky, the Minister of Justice, I  is one of them. A successful trial of strength with opponents always tends to consolidate -I  the position of a Government, whether in a  Parliament or in revolutionary conditions 1  such as pertain in Russia to-day;  but it can hardly  be expected that the Provisional ;  Government can  long escape  further similar crises, and only an extreme optimist  can i  feel assured that similar &quot; moral victories &quot; can be won by them.        The disruptive tendencies of the revolution are  manifest not only in the fleet and j  the greater part of tbe Russian armies, but in the unity of  the Russian Empire.   The I  people of  Little Russia or the Ukraine are talking of separating  themselves from  the I remainder.   Now that the Crown  has gone and no strong central Government has I  taken its place the Baltic peoples are turning their thoughts toward local  autonomy, :  while even the Poles, divided from the  direct influences of the revolution by the. wall   of German  soldiery, are beginning to  doubt the  feasibility of a Russian  Republics I assistance in securing their national ideals.  The Russian  revolution is still in its early   stages, and before the full cycle of revolution is complete we must be prepared  to see I those oscillations  between  anarchy and reaction that  customarily follow the sudden j overthrow  of long-established institutions.    The one counteracting-  force making for I stability is  the  presence   of  an  aggressive enemy on Russian  soil. -  We cannot \ now afford  to rely  upon the  active military co-operation of Russia, but even if the ] Provisional Government were  to disappear and the pacifist obtain a lease  of control in   Petrograd, the Russian front will retain a potential menace  to the autocratic Central   Empires until the latter fall.        The position in brief would seem  to  be  that the  real  direction and power reside   with the  inner Committee of the  Council  of  Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Delegates who   control  the  Petrogradi garrison, while  the Provisional  Government  is tolerated  onlyI  as long as, and in so  far as, it &quot; toes the  line.&quot;  Nothing but  a German offensive is   likely at present to galvanise the Russian land and sea forces into real military activity,   and the Germans are presumably aware of this fact.   Meanwmile it would seem unlikely   that Russia as a whole wdll  make peace until Kaiserism in Germany has been mitigatedI   or abolished, as has happened to Czarism in Russia.        Nothing that the Allies  can  do further  at this  moment  can  assist  either  the   Provisional Government or  its  possible successors to restore Russiajto the place  she          [898-42]
occupied with regard to the war last year, as the Government of Russia exists for themoment on the sufferance of the workmen  and soldiers of Petrograd.  The situation isone  of perpetual insecurity,  and  most unsatisfactory from  the point of  view  of theAllies.     Nevertheless, any falling off of the support which the Allies  have agreed to  give to Russia  would at this moment merely  serve  to  encourage those who  either fromweakness or intent are turning in the direction of a separate peace.     The attitude as regards Constantinople and the Straits taken up by all exceptMiliukoff is doubtless known  to  the Young Turks,  who  are  quietly  watching  thesituation at Petrograd, and trimming their sails  according  to developments in Russia.A policy of non-annexation would, they doubtless feel, apply not only to Constantinoplebut to Basra, Smyrna, Cyprus,  Egypt, &amp;c,  though, of course, non-annexation  does  notnecessarily exclude liberation in the case of Armenia, Arabia, and Palestine.                                    RUMANIA.     The telegrams from Jassy are  anything but  encouraging.  The presence of theRussian  soldiers and  spread  of republican  propaganda give  one little hope  that conditions in the temporary capital can  improve.                                     ARABIA.     The visit of Sir Mark Sykes to Jeddah seems to have passed off without any undueapprehensions being aroused in King HusseuPs mind.  It is  indeed  fortunate that the communication of French hopes regarding Syria has been followed by the withdrawalof Colonel Bremond, who has for some months past aroused the suspicions of Feisal andhis father.   The policy of Colonel Bremond, or of those who instructed him, has beensuspected by the Arabs.   The retention of  the French military mission after it  had beendecided not to  send foreign troops to  Rabegh, and after the Turkish retreat from theWadi Safra, has been unfortunate.     The withdrawal of Colonel Bremond  may be a  convenient reason for discouragingan Italian Mission at this juncture.  Such a mission would appear to be somewhatprevious until at least Medina has fallen and there is no prospect of Turkish reinforce-ment being sent to the Hejaz from the Caucasus.     The coming visit of M. Picot to  King Hussein  will be most beneficial, for  theformer will be able to obtain  the views  of  the leading Independent Arab Sovereign onArab aspirations at first hand.

Reuter telegraphed on the  3rd May that on  the1st May M. Miliukoff had telegraphed to the Russian  diplomatic agent in each  of  theallied countries instructing him to hand the following note to the Government to whichhe was accredited  (&quot;Morning Post, 4th May, 1917) :          &quot; The  Provisional  Government  of Russia  published  on  the  27th April  a     manifesto to Russian citizens in  which it explained the views of the Government     of free Russia in regard to the objects to be attained in the war.  The Minister for     Foreign Affairs instructs me to communicate to you the contents  of the document     referred to, and to add the following considerations :- -         &quot;Our  enemies have  striven  lately to  sow  discord  among our  Allies  by     propagating absurd reports regarding the alleged intention of Russia to conclude  a     separate peace with the Central Powers.  The text of the document annexed will     form  the  best refutation of such  inventions.   The general principles  therein     enunciated by the Provisional Government are in entire agreement with the ideas     which were repeatedly expressed up to quite recently hy eminent statesmen of the     allied  countries.   These principles were also lucidly expressed in the  words  of the     President of our  new Ally, the great oversea Republic.         &quot; The Russian Government, under the old regime, was certainly  not prepared     to ajjpreciate  and share these ideas  as to the liberating character of the war, the     establishment of a stable basis for the pacific  co-operation of nations, the freedom     of oppressed peoples, &amp;c.   But emancipated Russia can now use language  which     will be understood by modern democracies and hastens to  add her voice to that of     her Allies.   The  declaration of the Provisional Government,  being imbued with this     new spirit of  a free democracy, cannot naturally afford the least pretext for the    assumption that the demolition of the old structure has entailed any slackening on    the part of Russia in the common struggle of all the Allies.      [898-42]           -                                               B-
         &quot; On the  contrary, the  nation&apos;s determination to bring the world-war to a    decisive victory has been accentuated owing to the sense of responsibility which    belongs to all  in  general  and to each  one  of us  in  particular.  This spirit has    become still more  active by the fact that it is concentrated  on the immediate task    which touches  everybody so closely,  of driving back the  enemy who has invaded    our territory.   It  is understood, and the annexed document expressly states so,    that  the  Provisional Government in safeguarding the  rights acquired  for our    country will  maintain  strict  regard for the  engagements  entered  into with the    Allies of Russia.         &quot; Firmly convinced of a victorious issue to  the  present war, and in perfect    agreement with our Allies, the  Provisional Government is likewise confident that    the problems which were created by this war will  be  solved  by the creation of a    firm basis of a lasting peace, and that, inspired by identical sentiments, the allied    democracies will find a means of establishing the guarantees and penalties necessary    to prevent any recourse to a sanguinary war in the future.&quot;    Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on  the 3rd May [No.  620] that he had been informed by M. Miliukoff that the Workmen&apos;s  Council had received the  note with a storm  of protest; that  it had been discussed in  a sitting of the Executive Council which hadlasted till  4 o&apos;clock in  the  morning, and that the discussion, which had been resumedat a later hour, was still proceeding.   A plenary meeting of  the Council had been summoned for that evening.   On the 4th he telegraphed [No.  621]  saying that themeeting had been adjourned to that  day  without  coming to any decision ;  and on that5th [No. 628]  that  on the 4th it had sat  for the whole day.  In  the end the ExecutiveCommittee, after hearing the explanations of the Ministers, had  decided by a majorityof 34 to [group undecypherablej to accept their explanations and support  the Govern-ment  for  the  present, since it was  impossible for the Council  to take  over the reinsof government.  The minority was composed of extremists, but they  also  agreed thatit was impossible to assume  office at present.  The Executive  Committee then drew uptwo appeals to the  public in which all classes were  implored to  keep calm  and  to trustthe Committee to deal with  the situation ; these  had been posted up throughout thecity.  Soldiers were  urged not  to  appear in  the streets armed  unless called on  inwriting  by the Committee, which alone had the right to issue such orders.  Workmenwere asked to leave all arms at home, and to abstain from street demonstrations duringthe next  two days.  The  General  Council  approved  the action  and appeals of theCommittee by an overwhelming majority.    M.  Miliukoff handed to  the three allied Ambassadors on the 5th May the text of theofficial communique which  the Government  had published in explanation of the note to the Powers.   He explained that  it was not to be regarded as a new note  but as an explanatory commentary on the last pne.  It contains three points :     1. The note was  most  carefully considered  and  its text approved by the whole           Government,    2. The expression  &quot; decisive victory &quot; referred to  the attainment of  the  ends set           forth in the Government declaration of the  9th April.    3. The words  &quot;sanctions and guarantees for a lasting peace &quot; meant  limitation of           armament, international  tribunals, &amp;c.    In  regard to  the  agreement  arrived  at, Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed  on the5th May [No. 269]  that the Government claimed it as a victory for itself.   This  hesaid was to a certain extent correct,  but  it had had to give as well as to take.   It hadextorted the admission  that the Committee was not in a position to take office ; but,  onthe other hand, the Government  had not disputed its claim  to the exclusive  right  toissue orders to the  troops.     The Proposed Military  Service Agreement. Lord Robert  Cecil telegraphed on the4th May [No. 877]  to Sir G. Buchanan, with reference to the telegrams sent  by him onthe 25th April [Eastern Report XIV, p.  ]], saying that it was  impossible  to ascertainnumber of Russians who would opt for service in Russia, but as far as could be foreseen,and subject to modification  owing to submarine difficulties, about 20,000 Russians couldbe sent back before the ice,  which should be  a  sufficient guarantee of our good faith.Facilities, would be  afforded for the wives and dependents to accompany  such Russiansas might elect to return.     The question of Russians  serving with  the  Russian contingent in France was one
   entirely for the Russian Government to settle with the French  Government and with      20 1   their own military authorities in France.  If  the  Russian  Government wished to call   up Russians here to serve in France, no objection would  be raised, but such Russians   could  not  be forced to go to France.   Such  a provision  could  not be  introduced  into   the agreement, which  provides  only tor the  reciprocal return of Russian and British^subjects to their own countries.                                                              -       In view of the guarantees to give facilities for  Russians to return, Sir G. Buchanan   was instructed to press the Russian Government to accept the draft agreement without   delay, as a Bill would be introduced at onee.       The Navy. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 7th May [No. 637] that news had   lately come through from several  surces that  in the  Baltic flee:;  the  attitude of the   seamen was (? changing) for the worse ; that in some cases  they were showing a disintegration-   clination to take their ships f? to) (? sea) if  called on ; and that  they were  becoming   more exacting in regard to control over, the (? general) business of the fleet, internal and   external.   Yesterday  (?  Naval Attache&apos;; saw Admiral  Kedrov,   who quite frankly   admitted (? he did not) like the developments of the last  fortnight.   Since and (? even)   before the 1905 Revolution, advanced political views were well known to be widely   held by the men of the Russian navy (? and he) feared that the recent propaganda  of   the extremists in Petrograd had affected and continued to affect the more revolutionary   elements among them.       Unfortunately, enforced inaction of Baltic fleet during the long winter  had facili-   tated the spread of such influences, and in the larger  ships  the  narrowly (? restricted   defensive position of the Russians in the Gulf of Finland gave few opportunities for the   main squadrons to cruise on  exercise, but little improvement in this respect could be   expected.   The men, through their  committees, now expressed the  desire to set up a   control commission of their own to watch over the  operations of the division staff of the   Admiral Commanding, Maximov, who himself had  admitted to Admiral Kedrov that he   had. allowed too much  authority to slip from  his  grasp.   The Admiralty would like  to   replace him, but considered neither the present moment nor the present conditions to&apos;be   favourable ; in other words it was afraid to do it.       Admiral Kedrov, though allowing that the Baltic fleet  had lost considerably in [? the   power to]  attack, was still of opinion that,  based as this was  on extent of the mine-   fields, its efficiency  for defence had  not greatly suffered, and the Naval Attache shared   this view.       The Gulf of Riga, save for its northern entrance, was now clear of ice, which   peculiarly favoured an enemy attack, of which so far there had been no sign.  The Gulf   of Finland was also nearly ice-free westward of the meridian of Helsingfors, and Russian   mining craft had already begun to repair the advanced and the main minefields, without   having as yet met any opposition.                                      RUMANIA.       May-day Celebrations. Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 2nd  May [No. 224]  that   a serious situation had been revealed by the May-day  celebrations  in Jassy by Russian   troops.  With the consent of General Tcherbatsheff, General  SakarofFs successor, a   meeting of Russian troops  was held  in the afternoon, the  general having been told  that   the meeting would have a warlike, not a pacifist, character.   At this meeting a violent   speech, advocating a revolution in Rumania, Avas made by a sergeant, who urged that,   as the Rumanians were not prepared to carry it out themselves, it  should be  done for   them by Russian troops.  Later there were processions of Russian troops with red flag :   Rakowski,  a leading  [? ringleader  of] Socialists a Bulgarian by birth having  been   taken from his house, where he was under police supervision, made a violent speech  to   the manifesting troops, who had assembled in the jn&quot;incipal square of the town.  General   Tcherbatsheff&apos; was, Sir G. Buchanan believed, away at the time.       Rakowski has long been suspected of being in German pay, and German propaganda   is  clearly at work among the Russian troops ; it is therefore all the more remarkable   that the new Russian  Government recently asked the Rnmanian Government to let him   go free, which it refused to do.  The Rumanian  Government is very anxious, and, as a   precaution, has brought Rumanian reinforcements into Jassy.       Telegraphing again on the  4th May [No. 234], he  said that he  had  been  told by the   Russian Minister that he. and General Tcherbatsheff had telegraphed asking that two   members of the Duma should visit Jassy,  in order to counteract German  influences   among the troops.
     Sir G. Barclay was glad to say that the Rumanian Government appeared to realise the danger of any parade  of force by Rumanian  troops, and the  reinforcements [? so]much in evidence on the 2nd May  were  no  longer so  conspicuous,  The  situation  was still precarious, and any  further manifestations by  Russian troops similar to those ofthe 1st May  would  be  extremely dangerous. &apos;  He  understood  that the  King  wasfavourably impressed with General Tcherbatscheff.     Finance.-Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the  4th May [No. 235], saying that theMinister of Finance had  invoked his assistance with a view to obtaining an opening ofa further credit of forty million pounds, in which he hoped that the French Governmentwould participate, as in the former loan, and that  the financial  assistance now being given to the  Allies  by the United States of America would facilitate the new advance..Of forty million pounds lent to the Rumanian  Government, twenty million pounds hadbeen spent on the suppression of the harvest [sic].   Twelve million pounds were held in reserve as cover  for advance from  the  National Bank, and there remained  only eightmillion pounds.                                    TURKEY.     Miscellaneous. An agent reports:  (1)  That Mehmet Ali, commanding the FirstArmy  Corps, had been arrested with several officers  of his staff and  imprisoned atConstantinople.  (2)  That the  object of the visit of Talaat Pasha to Berlin is said to bethe discussion  of concessions by Turkey to Russia, with a view  to coming to terms,Talaat fearing that the general situation in Turkey was very shaky.:                                    ARABIA.HEJAZ.     Visit of Sir Mark Sykes. Sir R. Wingate transmitted  on the 7th May [No. 496] atelegram from Sir M. Sykes dated the 6th May.   Sir Mark said that he saw Faisal atWej on the 2nd May, and explained to him the principle of the Anglo-French agreement regarding the  Arab  confederation.  After  much  argument, he seemed  satisfied  and accepted the  principle.  On the 5th May he had a long interview with the King of Hejazat Jeddah,  and gave him  the following message as from  His Majesty : His Majesty theKing takes this opportunity of expressing to the King  of Hejaz his great satisfaction atthe progress of the Hejaz forces,  and his  confidence in  the efforts of the King of Hejazand his courageous and able sons, the Sherifs now commanding the Arab forces, who arecontributing  materially to  the  cause of the Arab  peoples, whose ultimate enfranchise-ment from persecution will mark an epoch in the development of civilisation  andpr-osperity in Asia.   The King  of Hejaz  replied as follows :  If. it is permitted withoutwant of respect for me to  speak as follows, I would, beg you to say that:  On the king of England&apos;s forehead is the kiss of peace, &quot;on his  Queen I invoke my blessing,  and theroyal children of  England&apos;s King I  embrace as children of my children.    In the course of the interview the  King insisted on two points, both of which are important and worthy of consideration and sympathy :      1. That  if France annexed Syria  he would  be open to the  charge of breaking           faith  with the  Moslems of  Syria by having  led them  into  a rebellion           against the Turk in order to hand them over to a Christian Power.    2. That  if Arab  independence be  not assured he feared that  posterity would           charge  him with   assisting in the overthrow of the  last Islamic power           without setting up  another in its place.    Sir Mark Sykes explained  fully, in accordance with  his instructions, the agreement regarding the Arab confederation or State.  The King seemed relieved, as the agreementof the Powers if realised would dispose of his  two points.  He also impressed on theKing the importance of the Franco-Arab  settlement, and at last got him  to admit thatit was essential to Arab development in Syria, but only after a very lengthy argument.     Sir  Mark  asked that  M. Picot should be told  that  he  was satisfied with hisinterviews with Sherif Faisal and  the  King of Hejaz, as they both now stand at thesame point as was reached at the last joint  meeting with the three Syrian delegates in cairo, and that, the King of Hejaz having expressed an earnest desire-to see M. Picot,he had taken the liberty of fixing an interview for the  19th  May at Jeddah.    Italian Mis si on. Sir  R. Wingate  telegraphed  on  the 6 th May [No. 493] sayingthat he  had been  informed by the Italian consul-General  that a special mission
composed of Moslem representatives from Tripoli, Cyrenaica, Erythrea, and  italian somaliland was  being sent by.the Italian  Colonial Minister to Jeddah and Mecca to study questions  respecting Italian pilgrims and  the foundation of a hospice  for sick and  indigent  pilgrims.   A native doctor  and interpreter  would  be  attached to  themission, which would be assembled at Suez in the course of the next few weeks.  TheCons id-General asked that all possible facilities  might be granted in  Egypt  and  atJeddah, stating that the mission had no political  object.  Sir R. Wingate said  that  hewas taking the necessary steps for the provision of the facilities required.     In regard to this Lord Robert Cecil telegraphed on  the  8th May  to Sir R. Rodd[No. 840] instructing him to enquire as to  the objects and scope  of the mission witha view to obtaining confirmation of its non-political  character.RED SEA BLOCKADE.     Want of Co-operation on the part of the French  and Italian Authorities. the resident at Aden telegraphed on the 3rd May [A.P. 351] that  the Senior naval Officerof the Red Sea patrol had again called his  attention to the  fact that, on account of thewant of co-operation of our French and Italian neighbours on the African coast, the usefulness of the  Red  Sea patrol was  largely impaired.   There was ample proof that,although  they were  aware of the orders that  all dhows from French and Italian portsfrom Jizan should  call, at Kamaran on both outward and homeward voyages, no super-vision was exercised over  the  dhows  sailing from these  ports.  In the last seven months only three Italian dhows had called at Kamaran, though the Italian authorities had admitted that their dhows traded with Jizan.   It was known too that French dhowsfrom Obokh  and Jibuti were landing  goods at  Dhubab and other places, deliberatelyrunning the  blockade;  and  dhows from Assab and Massowah were  doing the same.There had been a lengthy correspondence with the French and  Italian consuls, who hadloyally done everything in their power  to support  the request for co-operation.  TheFrench  and Italian governors had  promised  to  do what they could, but reports  showedclearly that the amount of cargo run was  on the increase, and that very little  control was beina1 maintained.                                    PERSIA.    Internal Conditions. Sir C.  Marling telegraphed on the  3rd May [No. 155] withreference  to  his telegram  of the  24th  April [Eastern B-eport XIV, p. 6], saying thatthe attack on Akbar Mirza&apos;s position  as  Governor-General of Ispahan  (indirectly anattack on  the Cabinet) was  being  pushed vigorously, and was supported not only  bythe Bakhtiaris, but also by the Shah.   The  Cabinet was being  encouraged to resist it by himself and by the Russian Charge  dAffaires;  and the latter was using, inter alia,the arguments that Russian military authorities  at Ispahan required Akbar&apos;s maintenance in office, and  that as His Imperial  Highness had been appointed with the  approval ofRussia,  no change  could  be made without her assent.   This attitude is of courseentirely incompatible with a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of  Persia.,and is calculated to  precipitate the whole series of questions in which we are jointlyinterested: financial control, public forces in the north  and  the south, spheres of influence,  &amp;c.   Indeed the Prime Minister had intimated that he was about to address anote to  Sir C. Marling asking for a reply to the Persian proposal for financial reform.    On the 8th May Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No. 164] that there was much talk ofestablishing a republic, and that the talk had genuinely impressed the Shah, who hoped to find salvation in giving way to every demand made by the so-called Democrats.  Hehad now informed the Prime Minister under their  pressure that he  must  reconstructhis Cabinet  by  the inclusion  of Moteshar-es-Sultaneh, Musteshar-ed-Dowleh, andanother pro-German in place of Sirdar. Mansur, Firuz Mirza, and Kawam-ed-Dowleh,or must  resign.   The Prime Minister  replied  that he  could  not  assent to it;  such achange  would be strongly resented by  thei two Legations.   He declined, however, to tender his resignation.  Sir C.  Marling  told the Prime Minister that he was quite in accord with his reply.   It would be impossible for him to  carry on his former policy with these new colleagues.   With the support of the Shah they would force him tomake objectionable  demands on  us, and if they  were refused point-blank he wouldaccuse  His Majesty&apos;s Government of insincerity in presenting them,  and we  should thus have to make concessions to keep him  in office.   In any case,  his own positionwould be  one of most humiliating powerlessness.  It seemed, however, to Sir C. Marlingclear that the Shah attached some importance to retaining the Prime Minister, and itwan foreign to bis character to take so  decisive a step as to dismiss a Cabinet.  Under      [898-42]                                                          C
the circumstances, Sir Charles thought that the best thing for  the  Prime Minister todo was  to  refuse to carry out the Shah&apos;s wishes on  tbe ground that he had ascertained that such a change would be regarded as indicating a departure from Persia&apos;s declared policy of benevolent  neutrality, and be calculated  to produce the worst  impression onHis  Majesty&apos;s Government, who might have  to reconsider its  attitude towards thatcountry.  The Prime Minister agreed, but  he was  evidently convinced that the hostileinfluences surrounding the Shaii would shortly bring about the fall of the  Cabinet.  sir c. Marling added that  the  Russian  Charge  d&apos;Affaires,  who used  somewhat  similararguments in discussing the situation  with the Prime Minister, entirely concurred inthe proposed course.     With  reference  to his telegram  of the  25th  April [Eastern Report XIV, p.  6],Sir C.  Marling telegraphed on the 4th May [No.  160], that  elections  appeared to be inevitable.     Ex-Deputies had met on  the previous day,  but no answer had been  given to questions put before them as  to  whether the electoral law  ought to be modified ; aresolution was, however, passed that only a Mejlis Council could  make any alteration inthe existing law.     Proposed Financial  Reorganisation. Sir C.   Marling telegraphed on the 3rd May[No. 156] that  the note referred to above  had reached him ; it urged  that financialreorganisation should be undertaken  at once  in  the interests  of  both England and persia.   The note stated that Persia proposed to apply to Prance for an expert to whosedecision  would  be left the  number  of subordinates.   It ended  with  an expression of confidence that the British Government  would agree with the proposal to forward it.In reply,  Lord  Robert Cecil  telegraphed on the  6th  May [No.  133] saying that sir C. Marling  should endeavour  to  gain  time by  referring the note  home by bag,and  stating  that Plis Majesty&apos;s Government   might be relied  on to take into friendlyconsideration any proposals  of the Persian  Government when  received.  The  presentsituation  at Petrograd  he said precluded  the possibility of  pressing the RussianGovernment.                                      INDIA.     The Mahsuds. The Viceroy telegraphed  on   the 4th May that Sir George Roos-Keppel  had  reported that  in  the general tribal  jirga  at  Kanigorum  the so-calledfriendly Mahsuds had  taken part  and had sent a letter to  the political agent  to theeffect that they must cease relations  with  the British territory and eventually  join in hostilities  unless they  were guaranteed  exemption from oriental  punishment.  this guarantee  could not be  given, and the  general  hostility  of  the  whole tribe  wouldprobably have to be  faced.  To give the guarantee  asked for would  not materially alle-viate the situation and would be a hopeless  embarrassment in the future  settlement ofthe Mahsud problem.                                AFGHANISTAN.     Viceroy s Monthly Report. In his report dated tbe 2nd May the Viceroy said thatthere was no change in the internal situation.   The  news of the fall of Baghdad was reported to have greatly disconcerted the  pro-German faction and to have  givensatisfaction to the Amir as being calculated to  strengthen his hands.  Recent events inRussia  did not  appear so far to have excited any particular interest in Afghanistan.The Amir was reported to have recently  expressed  to his entourage  his gratificationat the  appreciation  of his  policy by British  statesmen  and   to  have  expressed hisdispleasure at the attempted misrepresentation by  certain  of his  officials of our military preparations on  the frontier as being directed against Afghanistan.ADDENDA.                                     RUSSIA.     M.  Eerenshys  Vieio of  the  Situation.-Sir G.  Buchanan  telegraphed; on the8th May [No. 644] that he had had a conversation with M. Kerensky on the situation.Sir G.  Buchanan began  the  conversation by saying that  he had hoped  that therevolution  had broken down the last barrier  between us, but we  were now  more the
 object of suspicion than ever before ;  and he was discourager! by the attacks constantly&quot; made against England, who was accused either of waging a war of  capitalism or one for imperialistic aims.   The Russian people seemed to have forgotten  bow indignant they were with us for not at once declaring war on Germany.   He then  briefly outlined the negotiations which had preceded the war and the frequent declarations since made by His Majesty&apos;s Ministers as to our aims, contrasting them with those  of Germany.   If Germany were now to declare for  a peace  without annexations  or contributions, it would only be because she knew that she was beaten.     M.  Kereusky (? acknowledged) that the press (&apos;?  of extreme) Left sometimes went to indecent lengths in its attacks  on the Allies ; but the  Government could  not, without violating the principle of a free press which it professed, interfere.  The attitude of the extreme Left had  been provoked by what they regarded  as the  &quot;brutal&quot; refusal of the Allies to ask Germany what the  peace  terms were last December.  They believed that the German Social Democrats  were on  the. point of revolt; but he hoped that Schiedernan&apos;s declaration that a revolution in  Germany during the war was unthinkable would  have a  salutary  effect.   Germany might,  however,  at  any  moment make overtures  for peace, and, in his  opinion, the Allies ought  at  once  to enter  into an exchange  of views so as to be ready with a  reply.   If the Allies  were to make some gesture  to show that they were ready to follow the example set by Russia in  renouncing Constantinople, the anti-Ally agitation would lose all its force.  On his remarking that even M. Miliukoff was now committed  to this renunciation, Sir G.  Buchanan said that he was mistaken, as, judging from M. Miliukoff s language to himself, he was  determined to keep it.  M.  Kerensky replied that  at any rate  M. Miliukoff would not have  a deciding voice and that the foreign policy was to be controlled by a Cabinet  Committee- of-&apos; three.  He spoke strongly against the  Italian  claims and said he feared  that  the question of the German colonies  might  prove  a difficult one.  Sir George Buchanan replied  that, as he was ignorant of the views of his  Government as regards the  fate of the German colonies, he  could only point out that those  colonies  had  been  mainly conquered by our  own colonies, which, as  free self-governing democracies, must have an important voice in the final settlement.  Moreover, it would certainly not be  to  the interests of humanity to  restore the natives of the German colonies, which were already in our possession, to the tender mercies of German colonial administration.     Speaking  of the recent crisis, he declared that there would be no  recurrence of disorders.     In  reply  to the grave apprehensions which  Sir  G. Buchanan  and  the Military Attache, who was also present, expressed in regard  to  the  disastrous consequences of the Socialist propaganda in the army and  the fleet, M. Kerensky repeated  that  the Russian army only            German offensive to  make  it pull  itself together.   He admitted that  the state  of the fleet was  unsatisfactory, and that the crews of two of the ships at Helsingfors had declared that they would only go to sea when they thought fit ; but he expressed the conviction that when the momnnt came they  would follow the rest of the fleet.     Sir G. Buchanan said that he was afraid that  M. Kerensky  underrated the effect of the  anti-war propaganda on the  great mass of  the Russian people.  Apathy about the war and a general desire  for peace, taken in conjunction with the unsatisfactory state of the army and navy, were  facts which must be  taken into consideration in framing our reply to the recent Russian  note, as a strengthening of the peace agitation in Russia by an uncompromising attitude on  our  part might be attended with very serious  consequences.      Declaration of  the Provisional Government. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 9th May [No.  048] that  the newspapers of that day had published a  declaration of the Provisional  Government, of which the following is a summary :  While fully recognising the onerous  responsibility  and  enormous   difficulty  of  its task, the  Provisional Government  had  assumed office  convinced  of  the  whole-hearted desire  of  the people for the immediate introduction of the principle of civic freedom  and equality, the establishment of  local  administration  on a democratic  basis, the extension to the army of  all civic rights  consistent with  the  maintenance  of  discipline and military organisation, and  the continuation  of the war in  close accord with  their Allies. . The declaration  then specified what had  been done  during the short period the Provisional Government had held office.   Important State reforms, such as abolition  of all restrict tions respecting faith and nationality and abolition  of capital punishment, have already been effected.   The food question and the problem  of  transport had  been handled with a considerable measure of success.  The autonomous rights of Finland and  Poland&apos;s
claim to independence had been recognised.   In foreign matters the Government had (based its policy on an abandonment of any infringement of the liberty of other peoples,and in  close union with advanced democratic views, was  seeking  to  obtain  a lasting peace.  It  then  referred to the  difficulties with which the Government had had to contend, and stated that those  difficulties had materially increased of  late and inspiredalarm  for the future.    The.  Government policy throughout  had been to avoid allattempts  to assert its  authority by force.   The declaration confessed that popularsupport had not been given in  due  measure, and that in consequence the difficulties had become almost  insuperable;  it warned  people  that a continued  failure to  placeState interests above class and party considerations must inevitably lead to anarchy andthe eventual loss of  the freedom won.   In conclusion, the Government appealed to alltrue patriots to rally round authority, without which  there  could  be  no real freedom,and so to  enable it  to carry  out its  functions  until the convocation of constituentassembly.   In particular the declaration summoned representatives of those  sections ofthe people which had not taken any direct share in the administration of the country tojoin the Government.                                      HEJAZ.     Colonel Bremond. On tbe 8th  May Sir  ft. Wingate transmitted a telegram fromSir M. Sykes j No. 23]  saying that, after a careful study of the situation at Wej andJeddah, he was  convinced that the sooner the French Military Mission was removed from Hejaz the better.   The French officials only served to promote dissension.   Theywere without exception anti-Arab.   Their line  was  to throw cold water on all Arabactions and to crab  British operations.  They made no attempt to disguise that they desired the failure of the Arab movement.   He did not believe that M. Picot would be strong enough to carry the day without assistance, but he had made representations to, Paris.  Sir Mark Sykes suggested therefore that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make representations that the  French Military Mission in  Hejaz had  fulfilled its purpose,and that  it should be brought to an end.  Pie found, he said, that his chief difficulty in improving the feeling between the Arab and the French was due to Colonel Br^mond&apos;sdeliberately perverse attitude and policy, which was in no way minimised by  M.  Picotfsadvent.  [See Eastern  Report X, p. 4, and XI, p. 4.jPRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFPICB BX C. R. HARRISON.-11/5/1917.

ARABS  AND  TURKS.     The  policy  of  the  Allies,  declared,  and  presumablyimmutable, is to remove the Turks, as a governing people, fromall regions in which the Arab-speaking races are more numerous.We are committed  to expel from that  area the  element whichhas  been effectively dominant  in  south-west  Asia, with  verybrief  interruptions,  for  nearly a thousand  years, since the firstappearance of  the Seljuks in Iraq.  Indeed, if we; take accountof the  long  subservience  of  the Abbasid  Caliphs  to  theirpraetorians, we  must date Turkish  control  of Arabs back intothe  eighth  century.   This  domination,   however,  with  its implications,  is  not all that is  threatened.   The  Turks havesupplied  to Sunni Islam the only enduring political  force whichit has known its single  steadying  influence.  Never changingtheir  dynasty,  and responsible  for no  religious  schism,  theOsmanlis have  kept the Sunnites together, with  their heads inone unchanged direction, for the last  four  centuries.   Of their predecessors of  the same race, the. Seljuks,  Sir Mark  Sykes has put it well in his  GalipKs  Last  Heritage that they &quot;have  laidthe foundations of  all that  is  virile and enduring in  modernIslam.&quot;     It is not  suggested  hereby  that  our  policy is wrong  or should be revised.  Circumstances not under our own control havedetermined  it.   But after we have destroyed or even while weare destroying-we have to construct; and we shall be in the better position if we have realized the faults as well  as the  merits ofthose we are about to  set up, and the  virtues  as well as thevices of those we are setting down.           ...     When we look back over the history of the early  Caliphates and we must&apos; so do. since the present hopes and pretensionsof the Arabs, and the popular belief in their coming Renascencerest equally on ancient history we find the period of  genuineArab Empire  extraordinarily short.   Arabs  governed  Arabs,through  Arabs on an imperial scale for much less than a century!It is just the Omayyad Caliphate the Damascus period and no more.  The short  previous Meccan period  was all conquest andraiding accompanied  by no  more organization of  territoriesoverrun than would secure their payment of tribute.  The longBaghdad  period which was to follow would not  be government by  Arabs of Arabs  through  Arabs.   If   the  Abbasids  wereMeccans,  their  ministers, great  and often small, were Iraniansor Turanians and their trust was in mercenaries,  at first  Persian,then Turk, Circassian, Kurd-any race but the Arabian.   they themselves,  even when Baghdad had filled  with Semites, werepatently   anti-Arab  and  obscurely . Shiah,  though later  theywould parade conformity to  the  Sunna, which  Baghdad itselfhad  laid down.   And  if Abbasid rule  in Iraq  will not satisfyour formula, neither  will it. nor  will   that of  the Omayyads
satisfy it in Egypt, North Africa.,  Spain or Iran.   For there  the subjects were  non-Arab, and  soon many Governors  would  notbe  Arabs  either,  but Turks  like  the  Tulunids  of  Egypt,  orBerbers like the dynasties which were to detach the Mediterraneanshores of  Africa from the distant  inland Caliphate, which  knewnothing about the sea.     Sir Mark Sykes appreciated more justly the character of theAbbasid Caliphate than the reason of its coming to be, when hewrote  that it grew out of an  &quot; undefined  wish to replace agovernment  centred  in an Arabian oligarchy in Damascus  bya cosmopolitan Caliphate representative of the other peoples whohad  been swept into the folds of the mantle of  the Prophet.&quot;The compelling cause was  rather  the force of economic gravityin the great plain-land of south-west Asia.   Its centre shifted asinevitably from Damascus to Iraq  as it had shifted from Mecca toDamascus.  Lean  Hejaz could keep it  less than  a  generation :richer but not  opulent Syria grappled it for  two, but,  oncereleased, it could only swing round to rest  where the immemorialseat of Empire has been, whenever Empire has  lodged  in WesternAsia.   Should Empire  be  there again, the centre of gravity  willswing round  the  same arc.  Mecca will not keep  it, nor  canDamascus long ;  its swing  may be more slow, since  Iraq is not now what it was before Hulagu ruined its canals ;  but eventuallyit must gravitate to the old point of rest, and Semitic Empire will cease as before to be&apos; purely Arab or purely  Semitic, or anything more pure than West Asian.  There are Arabs  who  know this.Tradition and hope of  the  Hashimite Caliphate of Baghdad wasdoubtless in the mind of the Emir of Mecca when he claimed thestyle and title of Hashimite King.     The brevity  of purely Arab  Empire  was determined  lessby the force of non-Arab elements than by the inability of Arabsthemselves  to develope any system of  imperial  administrationmore  adequate than  the   Patriarchal.   They  made  no other-contribution to the  science of government.   The  .0mayyadsalike in Syria and Spain  seemed to  have carried on with  themachinery they found,  insisting only after a  time on  expressionin Arabic.  The Abbasids  owed  a better system to  non-Arabbureaucrats,&quot;   No  Arab  Caliph  ever  conceived anything soeffective and  stable as the Household  machine which Suleiman,first  Ottoman Caliph,  perfected on the model of the Imperialsystem, of  ancient Rome.     This is the dark side of  the  medal.   There is a  bright side.If the Arab could not  conceive or. construct an administrativemachine, he  could  use one  which another  had made,  and hecould impose  and maintain himself in supreme place at greatdistance  from  his  home   and  for  long  ages, supported bysurprisingly few men  of bis own race.   Except in  the historyof the later Roman Empire, there has been nothing like  thatunquestioning and  frank  acceptance  of  one  race,  as born to power, which was conceded to the Arab from Persia  to  Spain.
It was not only that Arabs were installed on thrones and treatedas God&apos;s  noblemen,  but  that all sorts and conditions  of menof other races Arabized themselves in name and speech.  Historytells us that, in fact,  Ahmed ibn Tulun was  a Turk and Saladinwas  a Kurd ; but except to the credit of the  Turkish or theKurdish blood, neither fact matters at all.   What does matter isthat the  Tulunids  and  the Eyubids washed  and  ultimatelybelieved themselves (as their remote descendants  still believe)  tobe Arabs.   Though some of the  earlier leaders,  for example,Omar, Khalid ibn Walid, and  Moawiya, not to  speak  of theProphet himself,  were conspicuously able  men, the  mass  of thoseArab aristocrats  of the  world  do  not  strike  us as superiorpersons.   They were imposed on  society by a  combination ofinfluences by the prestige  of a  whirlwind of  conquest which made fighting men wish  to  be Arabs, as  Napoleon&apos;s deeds oncemade  many wish to be  Frenchmen : by  the Arabs&apos; valuation of themselves as  a Chosen  People, and perhaps, most of all,  bythat desire for a national link with an exclusive God which hasmade earlier  men deify their Kings and  later men live and  diefor a principle of Legitimacy, however  ignobly  personified  bythe contemporary claimant of divine right.     Be that as it  may, the Arabian has to be ranked among thegreat assimilating races of history.   But so too  has the  Turkishwhich has made Osmanlis of more  and  perhaps better  aliens Albanians, Slavs,  Anatolians, Kurds, Circassians than  its rivalhas induced to be Arabs.   Indeed, the Turk has assimilated nota  few Semites,  while fewer  Turks have ever   come to regard themselves as Arabs probably none at all during these last fourcenturies  of the subjection of the one race to the  other.     This is  by  no means  all.   The  Arabian claims rank   tooamong the  fighting races of the  world; it  claims to be of thegreater civilizing  races ; and, finally perhaps to  be the greatestof all races that  have conceived and propagated  a  Faith.   If  the battle-force of the Arab is inconstant:, self-conscious and  too soonspared or spent, and therefore, has gone down before the steadfast,unsparing drive of the Turk, there is no comparison between the&apos;two races as exponents and agents of  civilization.  The  Arabsdeveloped  culture  both  while they fought  and when they had done with fighting  (as  under the later  Abbasids)  and  werepaying others to  fight for them.   As a governing race it mightbe said of them,  as a great historian of antiquity has  said  of another  people they began  to  wither   when   they kept  thepeace had  their  literary, scientific, artistic  activities ever been more  conspicuous than  under  those  latest Abbasids.    Arabcivilization owes  heavy obligations to the Greek, to the Persian,to the Jewish, but noL heavier than are debited to all other greatcivilizations.   Every advanced human culture must be  eclecticand its  originality is  reckoned  by the  measure in which  ittransforms and makes its  own what it has seized.
      So much for ancient history.  It shows us, on the one hand, the  Arab  people, capable  of  most  dynamic ideas, and able to impose them swiftly  and finally  on aliens within a wide radius of its homeland, but, this done, delivered incontinently of new ideas modifying the first and making new disunion ; terrible but  very brief in war ; inapt to conceive, organize, or maintain a  system of government  more adequate to  Imperial purposes than the Patriarchal :  of a natural nobility  which, under the influence of a religious idea and  the military success of its propagation, has been accepted freely by numerous alien races as superior  to their own nobility : receptive, constructive, and  prolific of  the higher civilization, builders of cities, quick  to sink actual resources in great works for  future  increase of wealth.   On  the other, the Turkish people,  equally terrible in  war but  more  enduring: incapable of conceiving or adopting the higher civilizations, but tenacious of  an  idea received  from  witbouc and  immutable in practice ;  able  to administer a system  of  government  and to hold by it,  though good or ill ;  as full  of  the will, to power as any Arab, with more effective sense of national unity.      To-day  we  are face to face with  these two peoples,  stilli incompatible, although one  has  been subjected in the main to the other for some four centuries, and once more at open odds ;  and, of the  two,  we  are  to  help the subjugated race to an enduring freedom throughout, its own area.      The shift  of the  world&apos;s   balance of  power and centre of civilization, to the West since the sixteenth century,  has  affected equally  both  Turks  and  Arabs,   depressing  their  relative importance to mankind and  their pride in themselves.   Inevitably both have become more dependent, or  one may  say (without intending  offence),  more  parasitic.   So far&apos; as  reception  and assimilation  of European ideas and practice go  their positions remain much the same, levantinized Syria balancing levantinized Anatolia and Constantinople.   But  in the acquisition and use of European  material  the  Turk  has   had  the  pull   from  his geographical position and his political  dominance.      Borrowed things however, affect vitally but  a small  part of either  race those  members   only  that  live  or  have  come into  the outer  westward  fringes and  taken  on  the  varnish of the  Levant.    Behind lie the masses  working out their own salvation.  It is between the respective masses of the two peoples that  the instructive comparison,  lies.   Neither can be said to have made much spiritual progress in these four centuries, and certainly not one more than the other : for the idea of nationalism  is about equally dormant in both.  But the Arab mass has lost most, because it bad  most to lose.   One most vital thing  has passed  from  it  the  religious prestige  which secured it apostolic primacy  and consequent empire.   The control of Islam has been in  the hands of its rivals too long, and the fire  of faith has burned everywhere too low, for the  spiritual force of the  Arabs to  be a  political force again.  To  be an Arab, even to  be  an and, is no longer an
ambition which possesses  men  of alien  races.   Even amongArabs themselves, descendants of the Prophet are  become very many and rather cheap, and one Sherif or Seyyid holds himselfabout as good as another.  The  best of them derive their statusfrom something more potent and less honourable than  the  bloodof the Qoreish.  The ruling house of Mecca owes, in all men&apos;ssight, its elevation and present wealth  to  an Albanian  Pasha ofEgypt,  and its present head to appointment by,the Porte.  KingHusein  will have to rely on very much more  than his pedigreeif he is  to be the agent of a new Arab unity.    As well as his apostolic primacy the Arab has lost, not hisaptitude for culture,  but his distinctive civilization.   Centuries ofsubjection and the nun Of the apparatus which ensured ease  andleisure in Iraq, and also in a lesser degree in Syria, have reducedhim below  even his  neighbours.   He can  show  a  spirit of humanity superior to the Turkish, but, at  the moment, few ofits fruits.    The Turk, on the other hand, has suffered no  loss equal tothe Arab&apos;s.   While the latter no longer has that  which gave  himinternational importance, the former keeps the  virtues, lower andfew, by which  he  conquered  his  rival at  the first his  un-imaginative tenacity, his disciplined  courage, his will  to power,and his  steadfastness in the pursuit of it.  Left  to himself, if therewere a fair field and no favour,  he would undoubtedly continueto govern the Arab as ill as in the past, but to govern and policehim always.   It is not from failure of either will or capacity thatthe Turk  must give wray :  nor, when the roof falls on  thePhilistines, will it be because his old strength has returned to theArab.     Once  it was said in mockery of a Jew, &quot; He saved others :Himself He cannot save ;&quot;  and neither of that Jew nor of Jews ingeneral is the gibe true.  Of their Semitic kinsmen, it might havebeen said so often, not in mockery, that we stand forewarned.                                                  D.G.H.                         ARABIA.                      Hejaz Intelligence.     On April 9, a messenger brought news^to Mecca that Alihad  summoned  Medina to surrender ;  that Fakhri Pasha had replied by asking for a  three days&apos; armistice, and  that Ali  badrefused  to  grant this.  There  has been no confirmation of this message up-to-date, while, on  the other hand, we have yet to hear of any decision being arrived at in the  Bir el-Mashi district.Fakhri  was  in  difficulties before  April  9, about reinforcing itsbeleaguered garrison ;  but Ave should judge, from Ali&apos;s subsequentcomplaints  about his  inability to reconnoitre and stop advancing
 troops  since  the - transference  of our  planes  to  Wejh,  that reinforcements have  been getting through from Medina.  Mecca has, indeed, reported  that most of the Medina garrison came to the  assistance of the post and suffered the loss of two machine- guns and many men.   In  Medina and neighbourhood there are certainly at least two line regiments, the 42nd  and the 130th, still left, besides Takruris, perhaps a gendarme battalion, and some technical troops.   Three aeroplanes are said to have been  burned as useless, there being lack  of petrol and possibly  of aviators : and three others have been sent down the railway to the El-Ala- Tebuk section.  With the troops distributed on the railway south of Hadiyah, the remnant of  the  Hejaz Expeditionary Force (as distinguished   from  the   Composite  Force)  has  now  a  total combatant strength of just  under 5,000  men.   The  Composite Force  is commanded  by  Mehmed  Jemal, not, as  previously supposed by   &quot; Kuchuk&quot;  Jemal,  former  O.C.   at  Jerusalem. Sherif  Ali  Haidar, the Pretender,  left Medina  early in March with his three sons and got  through to Damascus.     The Turks have organized, on the railway, patrols and repair- gangs of remarkable  efficiency, and none of the Arab raids made hitherto has caused more than a very brief stoppage of either transport or telegraphic communication,   The Arabs, on their side, have been unable, owing to transport and supply difficulties,.to maintain forces near enough to the line to keep communications cut continuously.   But they are  now both reinforced and better supplied.  On April  11, we heard that two of FeisaFs lieutenants, Mirzuk and Sherif Mastur,  had destroyed, apparently at their: leisure,  the  one,  1,200  metres  of  permanent   way north  of Medain Salih  station, the other, a culvert  near  Abu  Taqa.  The next  day  came  news from  Feisal  that  his   Wadi  Hamdh detachment  had blown up the bridge  at Baraka (we guess this to be the bridge near  Abul Nairn, repaired since  Abdullah damaged it a  month ago).  Since then a heavy attack has  been made  on the  Muadhdham-Dar el-Hamra section,  about which we await news.  The presence of Feisafs force in this region will probably bring in  again the Fuqara  Bedouins, who have not been over zealous of late.     Meanwhile sheikhs of northern  tribes have continued  to come to  Wejh and offer prospective and conditional service to Feisal.   The latest arrivals (on or about April 9), besides Audah abu  Tayyi and two other Huweitat chiefs, Mohammed el-Haitan and  Abdullah abu Tayyi,  have been  five Shaalans, viz., Mukhem (a  favourite  nephew  of  Nuri), Meshraf (a  cousin),  Majid, G-aithan and Farhan.   With  these were Mohammed ibn Majid  el- Majil of the Muhallaf and two Beni  Sakhr and  seven Sherarat sheikhs, Feisal, having dismissed these with arrangements made for the future, is going, or has gone,  inland with  Colonel  Wilson to meet his  brother, Abdullah.     Our R.F.C. detachment  has  been meeting with  a  good deal of difficulty in operating from Wejh, owing to the height of the
land behind, which compels  the planes to climb steeply to 7,000feet.  Two machines had to descend far inland for lack of petrol,but were found, supplied and  recovered intact  after forty-eight hours.                        TURKEY.       Turkish Indebtedness  and  the Cost  of the  War.    The  speech pronounced by  Djavid  Bey, in the  TurkishChamber of Deputies, on March 3, 1917, contains statements onthe subject of the  increased  indebtedness  of  Turkey, since thedeclaration of war, which may be taken as fairly accurate, seeing that they agree in  the main  with what we  already know of thedifferent advances  made  by  Germany  to  her  ally.  In  the summary which has readied us, the  amounts  of  the successiveadvances are not  very clearly  set forth, but the conclusion isarrived  at that the  general  debt to Germany,  including  thelast amount of  L.T.32,000,000 to cover expenses  up to August1917, amounts to L.T.142,000,000.  To  this must be added240,000,000  Kronen   which  are  being  advanced  by  Austria,as well as the sums due by the Turkish  Government for arrears of salaries and for  the redemption of requisition bonds ; and thegrand  total of  new indebtedness  from the declaration of  waruntil  August 1917, is stated at L.T.180,000,000.   Djavid Beyadded that, if the war ends in August, the  Turkish Public  Debtwill amount to  L.T.330,000,000 in all.     Of the various advances received from Germany, only thefirst instalment,  L.T. 5,000,000, was paid  in gold at the  timeof  the  declaration of  war.   A part at  any  rate of this sumreached Constantinople before  war was declared, and there canbe little doubt that the sight  of this gold had $, powerful effect in inducing the Young Turk leaders  to throw in their lot withGermany.  Once this  result  had been obtained, the Turks  havehad to content  themselves with German  Treasury Bonds, whichare deposited with the Administration of  the Ottoman public debt  as  securhry   for the  issue   of paper  money ;  of  this paper, according  to  Djavid  Bey,  L.T.79,000,000  worth  hasbeen  emitted.  This,   Djavid  Bey asserts, will  be withdrawnfrom circulation in a period of eleven years from  the conclusionof peace, and Germany has undertaken to  guarantee  the  main-tenance of Turkish paper money after the Avar at the same rate as German paper  money, and  to  send  Turkey  every  year  3 million Liras in gold for  the withdrawal of paper  on the market.Although the different loans are said to  bear  interest  at six percent, Djavid Bey makes the  surprising statement that germany has agreed not  to  charge any  interest on  them  until all papermoney has been withdrawn,  that is to say for eleven years  fromconclusion of peace,&apos; if the above arrangement is adhered to.
    The conclusions about the cost of the war in Turkey and itsdistribution among the Central Allies appear to be as  follows :-    (1).  The cost of the war in Turkey, up  to August,  1917,         is L.T.180,000,000, of which L.T.142,000,000 have been         advanced by Germany, and  about  L.T.10,000,000 by         Austria, while a sum of about  L.T.28,000,000 represents         internal floating  debt of  the  Turkish  Government for         arrears of salaries and military requisitions.    (2).  The  sum  due  to   Germany   for  munitions  is         L.T.25,000,000and for railway transport L.T.20,000,000.         The  latter  seems a very high  figure and requires         explanation.    (3).  Djavid Bey states that the newdebtof L.T.180,000,000         represents L.T. 5,000,000 monthly of military expenditure         for the thirty-six months of war to August   1916,  and         that the present  rate of  expenditure is  L.T.7,000,000         monthly.   It is  to be  noted that he reckons from         August,  1914,  the date  of  the  general mobilization,         whereas war was only  declared  at the beginning of         November, 1914.    The whole of Djavid  Bey&apos;s argument is,  of course,  basedupon  German victory and solvency, the prospect of which  couldnot be  estimated very accurately  by  the  Turkish Parliament.This body received the speech with great applause, and orderedthat copies should be placarded throughout the  Empire.                                                 R.W.G.                          SYRIA.               6         Palestine.                Present Economic Conditions.    The writer of  the  following Notes is the  same Jewishagricultural expert who contributed the Report published in ourNo. 33,  p. 504.   Being  unaware of this publication, he  hastraversed again some of the same  ground in his  second Report.Therefore we reproduce extracts only.  He has not been back to palestine in the interval, but has opened and maintained, with ourcognizance, intelligence relations  with co-religionists  and others in the country.Imports.    Palestine, being exclusively an agricultural country, used to depend entirely on foreign imports for all the mineral, industrial,manufactured, and  colonial products essential &quot;to  the  life  and welfare  of its inhabitants.   Whatever the  condition of the stocks
and  warehouses at the beginning of  the  war and  this will beconsidered  in  another   paragraph. the  blockade  -must   havefundamentally disturbed the life of the country.     The blockade, as far  as Palestine goes, is complete.  Nothingcomes in from the sea. &apos;  Before the outbreak of the Arab  revolta certain  amount  of colonial goods, rice, sugar, coffee, etc., usedto reach Damascus and Palestine from the  Hejaz, by the  wearyand, one would have supposed,  we prohibit caravan route.   Nowthis  scant)&apos;  source  of  supply  has  been  entirely  closed  also.Neither foreign,  nor  home-made goods worth  mentioning are coming from  the North by  railway;  Palestine   has  to  liveexclusively on. its  own individual, resources.          .....-    &apos;     Unless one has seen the country with  one&apos;s own eyes, one cannot realize what variety  of  essentials, and all but essentials,are  absolutely  non-existent  in  Palestine   now.    Manchestergoods, leather, coal,  iron, cement, iron nails, matches, tea,  cocoa,chocolate, sugar,   lubricating  oils, drugs, etc., etc.,  are  entirelyexhausted.  People of wealth wear mere rags.  Shoe-polish- hasbeen out of use for two years.   One could fill pages with  tragi-comic  illustrations of the  awful  state  of  things  which,  thissuccessful blockade has created.Exports.                                                   - --.     The  blockade has also stopped all exports.; and-this effect is another  cause  of ruin   to  the  country.   Most of the articlesproduced for export  are either perishable or otherwise uselessfor the mere upkeep of the inhabitants.                     &apos; &quot;...   Palestine used  to export a  certain-volume of-cereals,&apos;but-&apos;to-import nearly their equivalent in flour, rice, etc.&quot;  The failure ofthe  imports in  this  line  is  hardly compensated- by  the-surplusaccumulated on account of the.impossibility of export. (On theother   hand, the  country  exported  oranges (about 2,000,000boxes), wine,  almonds,  which  have no market, or  only a veryreduced one in Palestine  proper..    ...  .  -  .     - .   ...-.--&apos;  u : &quot;-   -  Unfortunately,  the production of oranges,-wine; ;ietc/becametoo  specialized ;  and  one has  now  distressing opportunities,forseeing, in Palestine,  the unsound  economic bases created  byUniculture.   Wealthy proprietors of orange orchards see notonly their crops decay, but their orchards deteriorate, for lackrbffunds  to maintain them,  while their people starve for mere bread ;whereas the poorer farmers, carrying on diversified farming, havebread, and the surplus of their crops is readily saleable  in thelocal market.     For  these orange or wine-growers the  conditions are the&apos;same as those which, in   the Beirut region, have been the  initialcause of distress.   This harbour exported annually over 20,000,000francs of  silk, while its total export was not more than 25,000,000.As the silk finds  no buyer nowadays there,  the-whole economic life  of the region  would have been shaken to its foundations bythe  blockade even without the brutal, murdering methods  of the
Turks  which   have,  however,  hastened  and  emphasized  theeconomic ruin.Issue of Paper-Money.     The issue  of  Turkish  paper-notes crowned the difficultiesdue  to  the tightening of  the  money  market.   As  soon as  thepossibility  of  the  general  introduction of  Turkish paper-noteswas  hinted, the public,  in Palestine, began to hoard up  all  thecoins they  could, lay hands on.  To  make matters worse,  thefirst bundles of Turkish paper-money, which reached Palestine,consisted  exclusively of  L.T.5 notes.   The exchange of a L.T.5note into five single notes cost at the start,        The fall of  thepaper-note was steady, reaching 27% of its face-value in march last.     The following may  serve as a striking  proof how powerlessthe Turkish Government is, severe punishments notwithstanding,to enforce the circulation of the paper-notes :(Jerusalem  Hebrew Daily,  &quot;Hatheruth&quot;  =  Freedom,  No.  92,                      28 January,  1917.Official Notices :     From official quarters  we have received for publication, inour  daily issue, the following official  notice, issued by the  bureau of the mutessarifiah :     &quot;It is  known that  the circulation of gold coins is  strictlyforbidden, and those who detain such coins  have to present themfor exchange into paper-notes, at the Treasury.   But in order toprovide for the needs of  the public,  and in order to  get wheat atconvenient prices, and in good condition, the following decisions have been adopted by the &quot; Committee for supplying wheat&quot; :      (a) Inasmuch  as  it is impossible to get  wheat  from theArabs  otherwise  than  by  paying  in  gold,  and owing to  the pressing needs of the hour, it has ,been decided to change  thewhole capital of the &quot; Syndicate&quot; into gold.     (b) Inasmuch  as  the human  sentiment of mercy  forbidsany man to starve his fellow man,  when there  is  plenty ofcereals  in  store, it is,  therefore,  the duty  of evetyone  whopossesses gold coins to apply to the  hon. Von. Grower (GermanConsul-General, apparently), President of the Executive of tbe&quot; Syndicate,&quot; to have them exchanged for  banknotes.     (c)  In conformity  with  the  former Notice, which remains in force, the circulation  of  gold coins, as  also the  trade in  coinexchange is forbidden to everyone except the &quot; Syndicate.&quot;     And whoever transgresses  these  orders, will  be punishedaccording to the regulations of the former Notice.&quot;         2. Kanun-than   1335 (^  26 January, 1917).     The  Turks try  to  explain  away  the  public&apos;s  lack ofconfidence in  paper-notes, by  the  ignorance of a peasantry, used only to gold and  silver  coins.  This  is an arbitrary official lie.
The peasants -(crassly ignorant it is true), accept the paper-notesin which they  have confidence.   Over  30  years  ago,  at thebeginning of  the  Jewish  colonization  movement  in Palestine,when the financial success  of  the enterprise was far from being-assured,  the  young  Jewish  communities were  faced  by thedifficulties arising from the scarcity of  small change ;  and theyrelieved  the situation  by  issuing  paper-notes  of  one  and of a half piastre.   The peasantry accepted these &quot; bons&quot; any  amountof them, in payment for their  products  or their work,  thoughthe &quot; bons &quot; were not guaranteed  by any bank deposit,  bearingmerely the seal of the Community.     At the  beginning of the war,  the Anglo-Palestine Co., theZionistic  banking  institution,  issued  numerous   &quot; guaranteedcheques &quot; of 5,  10 and 20 francs  each.   They were accepted toany amount by the public,  and for their full value,  as readily as government notes in other countries.  In fact, these &quot;guaranteedcheques&quot; helped to relieve the money market in Palestine in thefirst months of the war.  But the  Government became  jealous,and  abolished them,  threatening the A.P. Co.  with  proceedings for  unlawfully  issuing paper  notes.    This  persecution not-withstanding, people, even now, prefer the forbidden &quot;guaranteedcheques &quot; to  the  Turkish paper notes, though severe penaltieshave been pronounced against those who are caught refusing thelatter.     Even now the notes of the  Ottoman Bank, issued before thewar, and guaranteed by its Board,  are readily  accepted, whereas the recent ones are discarded.     The  real  reason  why the Turkish notes are disliked  is because people do  not trust this Government.  The catastrophewhich  followed the  Turco-Russian war  (1876-77), when theKaimeh lost its  whole  value,  is. still in  everybody&apos;s minds.   Afew fabulous fortunes were made then (the wealth of the Sursokfamily originated in this way), but the general public lost money,and  thousands of powerful firms  were ruined.   That  is whynobody cares to  accept the  new Kaimeh.     As is to  be expected  from such a  state of  affairs,  sonicusurers get  rich  by gambling  on  the  Exchange.   One getsnowadays three or four notes for one gold ponnd.   Old debts are paid in depreciated notes.  Another business also has developed,based on the good exchange which the Turkish paper  note nowobtains in Germany.   Normally the L.T. is worth  about 18*60marks  ; nowadays it fetches 22-24  marks.  It ^ays, therefore,  totransfer  Turkish pounds to  Berlin.   The rate of exchange  inAustrian crowns is still more.advantageous thirty-two to thirty-seven crowns for one pound.     The circulation  of currency is very limited  in Palestine ;but as  soon  as a trustworthy Government comesim.JfiddejL coinswill appear again,  especially in the  Nablus region,  and - to someextent, in the Gaza region.  A few men, who  had been unjustly
sentenced to  seven years imprisonment  each,  by  one of  the palestinian tribunals, agreed to pay the demanded. 1,000 Napoleonsd&apos;or as a bribe, in order to be allowed  an appeal (which was their right).   By signing a promissory note for 4,000 Napoleons d&apos;or,to be paid immediately after the war, the 1,000 gold coins were found within  a few hours in Nablus.   (February 19th,  1917).     It is characteristic that the Turkish official accepts  no bribein paper notes.   He  takes  only gold, the Napoleon d&apos;or beingmost favoured.Diseases.     The writer will not mention here those diseases, like malaria,from- which the  Palestinian  population  had  to suffer even in normal  times, to a larger or smaller extent.   He  will mention&apos;here only those diseases which have  recently  spread frightfully,either on account of the insufficient  hygienic measures  of  theTurkish army though  one  must  acknowledge  that,  in   this special  respect, the Turks have  made conspicuous  progress oron account of  the underfeeding of the population.     Cholera,  not unknown  before the war, was spread throughthe  army,  mostly  in  the  towns.  The mortality  was  not very-high, and  the disease  was less  prevalent in  1916  than  in  theprevious year.  The latest reports are that  there  is no cholerafor the  present.     Hunger typhus has spread frightfully and has decimated thepopulation as  well  as  the army.  Though typhus is supposed toabate during the summer, numerous cases happened in Jerusalem,even  in the  summer  of 1916.  According to the latest reports(20 March), typhus  is  spreading again.  In  the  Hebrew daily,&quot; Hatheruth,&quot; published in Jerusalem  (14  February, 1917), weread that the hospital specially designated  for  typhus cases inSafed has been re-opened, Dr. Halim  being in charge, and it hasnow about twenty  typhus patients.   Numerous cases of  typhusare reported, from  other sources, in Nazereth,  Jerusalem, etc.     Recurrent fever  was very  frequent in  1915  among  thesoldiers.  In  1916  this disease was  on the decrease in  the armyowing to the  marvellous results obtained by the Salvarasan cure.Of this remedy there  was plenty, and the  military doctors were held personally responsible for any fatal issue  due to this disease.But civilians could hardly afford to  be treated by this  cure, theinjection costing  L.T. 3.     Smallpox seems to be widespread, judging by the orders fortens of thousands  of vaccine doses ordered for Damascus fromthe Jewish Bacteriological Institute  at Jerusalem.*  Vaccinationon a large  scale is reported, in the above named Jerusalem Daily,at that  city, as well as at Jaffa and elsewhere.   *&quot; Orders were received, from 25 December, lilW, to 21 January. 1917, for 10,000&apos;doses;for the Municipal Government in Damascus, and 20,000 more for. the army in Damascus.&quot;-&quot;Hatheruth,&quot; 31 January, 1917.
     Syphilis.    Outside  a  few  ancient  places,  like  Caasarea,Palestine was  rather free from venereal disease ;  at any rate ex-extremely few rases used to come to the notice of the doctors.  -It is,therefore,  symptomatic, when one reads in  the  monthly reportof  the  Serological  Department  of  the  Jewish BacteriologicalInstitute at Jerusalem, that during  the months  of January and february  last, sixty-five  and sixty-six  cases of  syphilis  were submitted to the Wasserman test with thirty-two and thirty-fourpositive results.  This is a moderate number for  such a large population as  Jerusalem ; but since only the better  people applyat the Institute, these figures  are rather  striking  evidence  of anew addition to the scourges due to the Turkish arm)&apos;.     Drugs.   Pharmacies have been  sacked and drugs wasted.No wonder, therefore, that  most  drugs are  not to be  procurednow at any price.   On the other hand, one is surprised to learn that,  with  the interested  complicity of the Turkish  doctors,certain drugs can still be obtained.   Thus, quinine is still offeredat a relatively  moderate price  of  LT.12  to LT.15 in notes,corresponding to about LT.4 gold.    Crystallized iodine fetchesthe same price, which is out of  proportion.  Cotton and rubber,for medicinal purposes, are  absolutely unprocurable.  Castor  oiihas not been employed for the last two years.     On the other  hand, we have  reports  from  military  doctors,up to  March  14  last, complaining  that their pharmacy chestshave been  empty  for  months,  and  that,  except some quinine,they can prescribe nothing for their  patients.                 ;Commerce.                         .            .    .     The  country  is  dying  slowly ;  there is  no  trade  left.Reports from  Haifa,  Nazareth,  Tiberias,  Nablus,  Jerusalem,Jaffa, etc. invariably state that the shops and stores are  not  onlyshut, but empty, and that even their  doors  have been removed.Whatever exchange of products still goes  on is  done  secretlyfrom fear  both of  robbery by  the Authorities/and  the  penalties for the low exchange at which the notes are accepted.     The best  proof  how low commerce is, is to be  found in thefact that officers stationed in Jerusalem are reported to  complainof lack of  petroleum and sugar.  Thanks to  the superior skill ofAli Rushan Bey in squeezing out of the people the last that thej-have, the  officers  in garrison at  Jerusalem used to  be  wellprovided,  paying  for the products they got at  normal  pre-warprices.   If Ali Rushan Bey can  find  nothing  more, it  provesthat really nothing has been left.  It may be the reason why hehas been nominated  President of the Martial Court of Jerusalem.There is no more game in his old field, for a man of his ability.Bedel.                                                     &apos;     For the  relatively moderate  sum of  50 Napoleons a mam,liable to  military  service,  could free  himself  for  the wholeduration of the war, no matter  how  long it lasted.   He  could
be either enlisted or  invited  to pay a new &quot;bedel &quot; exemption-tax, only i  there were a new war after  a general demobilizationof at least 15 days.   That was  the  contract entered upon by thebedel-paying man with the government.  But  the Turks  havelearned the &quot; scrap of paper &quot; theory.  Seeing that this  war was going to be a long one, they devised new methods of making theexempted pay again, and issued a new  law according to whichthe &quot; bedel  &quot; exempted men at  first for  18 months only,  and finally,  for one year.    During  the  month of  October last, after  a  good deal of opposition from  Talaat, Enver succeeded in framing a  new lawabolishing the &quot; bedel  &apos; entirely.   But,  as usual with the Turks,the law is so framed that a loop-hole can  be  discovered, if theproper &quot;bakshish &quot; is  paid to  the officials.   After the &quot;bedel&quot;was finally abolished a way of escaping the  law  was provided, atleast within  the sphere of action  of the IV. Army.  There is no&quot; bedel  &quot;  any more, but by  paying a definite war-contribution,one can be freed  from  military  service.   This war-contribution is paid in kind.   Commodities have  to  be  forwarded  to certainappointed storage&apos;es ; the  exemptee has to provide the sacks or bagsfor the  commodities.   There is not a single sack to be found inthe country,  and people are making bags of  old skirts, rugs,curtains, etc., the heaped up stores presenting the wildest motleyof colours and stuffs.    The  war-contribution,  entitling  a  man  to  one year&apos;sexemption from  military service, can be paid  in the folio wing-kinds,  and amounts :          either :  4,000 Kgs  of wheat           or :   4,350  ,,   ,, barley                 4,000  ,,   ., potatoes                 5,050  ,,   ,, lentils                 3,200  ,,   ,, chick peas                 3,220  ,,   ,, bourgul  (crushed  wheat)                 4,200  ,,   ,, maize (Indian corn)                 4,300  ,,   ,, durrha                 8,000           ?    A glance at the list will suffice to show  the lack of proportionin the different  products.  Potatoes, for instance, were at all timesrather a luxury in Palestine.  Nowadays, after the locust invasionand the impossibility  of the introduction  of new  seed  potatoes,there  are probably  not 4,000  Kgs  of potatoes  in  the  whole country.Prospects of the Coming Crop.     Knowing,  as we  do,  that all  able-bodied men  are in theArmy,  and  that  only  old men and children are left to drive theplough  ; knowing too  that there  are practically  no animals  left,either  through  requisitions, or  through  the  terrible mortalityamong  animals, following the lack of pasture due to  the locustinvasion ; knowing  that very  few  people  could  afford to keep
seeds in the face of the famine we shall not expect to hear thatthere has been much ploughing&apos; or sowing this year in Palestine.In fact the reports show that most of the land is  left bare, andthat the preparation of it has everywhere been deficient.    The winter crop depend on the amount  and distribution ofrain.   The  amount  of  rain  has been  satisfactory ; but thedistribution of precipitation has been most unfortunate, as can be judged from the following figures :                      1916.                1917..              Oct.   Nov.    Dec.     Jan.    Feb.     Total.Rain in mm. :  T5   34*0    75*5    245*5    122*0     478*5    The first recorded rain fell on the 29th of October.  34 mm.of November rain  fell between the 3rd and 6th  of  the month.The next rain came only  on  the 11th of  December, or  after an interval  of five  weeks.   As  the November rains  were not sufficient to wet the ground  to the required depth, sowing hadto be  postponed till more rain came in December.   The amountof precipitation in this month was more than enough, but it fellunfortunately in  14  days, from  the  11th  to the 31st, so that little ploughing or sowing could be done during that month, themost  important for  these operations.   During  the  month ofJanuary  more than enough rain came, in torrential showers of34, 38*5  and 47*5 mm. at  a time (which  must  have  caused agood  deal  of erosion), and at too short  intervals :  135*5 mm.from the 1st to the 5th of January, 34*5  mm. during  the 10thand 11th  of the  month, 42*5 mm. from  the 20th to the  23rd,and finally 33 mm. from the  27th  to the 31st.    Very  littlesowing, under favourable  conditions, could be done during that month.   On the  other hand, the temperatures were too low andthe ground was  too  much  soaked  for  the rapid  growth ofthe early sowings, of  which much  must have been washed away,and there  were no seeds to  sow  a second time.  In Februarythere  were again  13 days  of  rain,  which must have handicappedthe field  work.    This  defective  distribution of  rain is feltespecially in years like the current one when there  are few bandsand animals.  The most  recent reports  state that some peoplestill continued sowing wheat at the end of  February.   Nothing-can be expected of such late sowing.    The prospects of  the coming harvest of cereals therefore, canbe only very poor indeed.   The hot winds  we experienced herein  March  and  early  in April  have  certainly  been felt inPalestine  too, and must have done damage.  The abundance ofrain  last winter promises a good  summer crop, but  this,  at its best cannot feed  the  country, and requires  for its success morehand  labour and care than the people can afford, under the presentcircumstances.
