SECRET.APPRECIATION OE  THE  ATTACHED  EASTERN  REPORT,  No. XXI.                                     RUSSIA.     THE situation in Russia has as yet produced no  reliable indication as to the finalturn for order or anarchy which events may take.   However, it is possible that next week matters may have assumed a more favourable complexion.                                     TURKEY.     The anxiety of the  Turks for the return of Eyoub Sabri  is worth  noting. . TheTurks are not usually solicitous about individuals unless there is some valid reason ofpolicy.  The menaces and threats are interesting. .                                  SOMALILAND.     The Mullahs letter to Mr. Archer is a  very interesting document.   Turkish pro-paganda has  evidently had  considerable scope in the Mullahs country. ;  The letter istypical of the frame of mind which, the Turks set  themselves to produce in those on whom they get to work.                                     ARABIA.     The news of Ibu Saud&apos;s communication  to. Abdulla is of good omen.                                     SYRIA.     The information supplied by the American consular agent, though six weeks old,is interesting.  Although we have not advanced into Syria, we should never forget thatthe permanent factors of unrest and poverty always count against the Turks.                                     PERSIA.     The situation in Persia does not improve.  The influence of the Russian revolutionon the country is what  had been anticipated  in earlier  appreciations of this report.                                     HEJAZ.     Although  there is  no news from  Hejaz this  week certain  points are worthmentioning.   The King of LTejaz has not any organised force at his disposal, and shouldthe Turks have the  opportunity of reinforcing Medina, there is every reason to suppose that they would make an attempt on  Mecca  next rainy season, September-February.The King would be in  no position to offer any resistance unless he had a formed bodyof troops at his disposal.                   t     June 21, 1917.

RUSSIA.     Revision of  Agreements. Sir  G.   Buchanan  telegraphed  on  the  14th  June[No. 890] that on the occasion of M. Thomas&apos;s farewell visit to the Council of MinistersM. Terestchenko handed him a note on the policy  of  the Russian Government, at  theend of which the following passage occurs :          &quot; Unshakably attached  to the  common cause  of  the Allies, the Russian     democracy greets with lively pleasure  the  decision of the allied  Powers  to satisfy     the desire of the Russian Provisional Government to see the revision of the agree-     ments concerning the final aims of the  war.  We are suggesting  for this purpose     that  a conference of representatives of the  allied  Powers should be  called  and     should take  place soon, when favourable circumstances allow.  The conference  will     not discuss the agreement, signed at London on the 5th September, 1914, and since     promulgated, which excludes the possibility of the conclusion of  a separate  peace     by any one of the allied Powers.&quot;     In handing a copy of this note to Sir G. Buchanan, M. Terestchenko said that he did not wish the  proposed conference to meet for a couple of months ;  the fact that hehad suggested one would, he said, tranquillise public opinion and tend to keep politicsout of the army.                                                                -     Mr.  Root&apos;s Mission. Sir C. Spring-Bice telegraphed  on  the  14th June [No.  1672]saying that the object  of Mr. Roots mission was merely to encourage the RussianGovernment in a determined attitude in regard to the war and to offer good wishes  and sympathy: the  Secretary of  State had said  that there was no special object in  themission resembling that of Mr. Balfour&apos;s to  the United States.     Mr.  Ramsay macdonald.-The Charge dAffaires  at Petrograd  on the 17th Junetransmitted  [No. 916] a  telegram from Mr.  Henderson to  Mr. Havelock Wilson inwhich he  said that the presence of the  Macdonald deputation was urgently requested by the Workfnen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Committee and  a refusal at this stage was likely tocreate difficulties for the Bussian Government;  he therefore strongly urged the removal       [898-48]                                                           B
arid  Portuguese  and Japanese, and Greeks and cannibals, and  Sikhs  and Banias, andMoors and Afghans, and Egyptians.  They are strong enough,  but  because of yourweakness you have had to solicit as does a prostitute.   So much for my answer to you.Beyond this I would say one word.  If your people have sense,  and  you desire  peace,think deeply, and  pour water where you  have raised  fire ;  and  arrive at  a. mutuallysatisfactory agreement and open all the  seaports.   If you hearken  to my word  letcaravans pass.   That is one thing.  Again, there  is an Arab,  Ibn Durmoon by name,from whom, when  I was in Berbera, I took coffee  valued at 80 rupees.  So, now I sendfor Ibn Durmoon  by the hand of my  two messengers 200 skins.  Let  him have the-skins.  Finis! i.

Ibn Saud and  King Hussein.-The Ara&apos;b Bureau  telegraphed  on the   14th  June[A.B.  720]  that Sherif Abdulla had  reported that Ibn Saud  had sent him a friendlyletter  in which he said  that be was-entirely anti-Turk, pro-Arab, and  pro-Sherif;and with the letter he  had sent him a valuable mare.JEBEL SHAMMAR.     Internal Conditions. Sir P.  Cox telegraphed on the 13th June  that  Suaiman  alDa Khil, who sought refuge in Hail from the Turks at  the beginning  of the war, had left that  place early in May and had reached Baghdad.  He said that Ibn Lailah wasall powerful with Ibn Rashid, but the tribesmen and townsfolk grumbled at  his Turkishpolicy, from which  they derived no profit;  there was strong pressure in  favour of coming to terms with us, and when the Shammar  were assured by returning caravans that weoccupied Irak, they were likely to insist on peace  with us.  There was a serious shortageof food.  But little merchandise had reached them from Koweit, and that recently sentto Najaf had been, Suaiman said, loaded in haste and it left in  fear with only a  thirdof the goods  recjuired.   Ibn  Rashid could not move from Hail in any direction.   this last statement is borne out by an Arab Bureau telegram of the 14th June  [A.B. 720 !,which says  that Sherif Faisal had stated that he had been informed  by the sheykh  ofthe Aneizah in  Quasim that  Ibn B,ashicl was  at Hail with a small following, andthat the  tribes were ordered  to attack him in the event of his  moving out towardsMedina.                                     SYRIA.    Internal  Conditions. An agent  obtained  the following information  from  an.American consular official who was in Northern Syria from the beginning  of the waruntil January 1916, when  he went to Damascus, where  he stayed  till  about  six  weeks ago;  the agent has known him for many years and considers his information  trust-worthy.   In his  opinion the whole of the  country is anti-Turk, but the native Syriansand Arabs have  been thoroughly cowed by tbe iron rule of Djemal Pasha, who, in turn,has a wholesome dread of vigorous action   being taken  by the  Druses, who  are strong and well armed.   They remember the massacres of their  people  by the Turks in thelast century, and, in the event of things goina; really badly with the Turkish forces  inPalestine, they would not lose the opportunity of paying off old  scores.  Djemal darenot take  vigorous action against them as, being hardy mountaineers, they would recpiireso large a force to  coerce them that he would have a  second  campaign  on  his hands.Their lands are  among the richest in Syria, and the  cereal  crop  is  largely in their hands.                                    PERSIA.     Great Britain and Persia. Sir C.  Marling telegraphed on  the 17th June [No. 212]in regard  to tbe   1907  convention.   He said  that Persia &quot;was  fast  moving   toanarchy  and, though  he  had no  belief in  her  self-regeneration, he  urged that theproper course was  to  support  the  few native elements that  desired a better state  ofthings and not to  alienate them  by trying to impose  reform.  If as seemed probablethe instructions to  the  Russian Minister should not differ materially  from those givento the charge d&apos;affaires, at least we  should be relieved from fear of aggression, and he invited consideration of the suggestion that we  should endeavour to regain the oldconfidence in British   friendliness  that  existed  before the  conclusion  of the  1907convention,  which Persians recognised to have been a defensive measure.   He believed
 that a spontaneous offer to tear it up, in so far as it concerned Persia, and to reconsider the provisions of the August agreement would go far to regain lost esteem ancl to place us in a position of friendly advisers.  If,  as  might  be anticipated,  Russia no  longer insisted on the August agreement, we should find ourselves in the position of having to impose on Persia  British financial control ancl the South Persia  Rifles ; and  troops would be necessary to  enforce the execution of the agreement  just as  the presence  of Russian troops ensured its acceptance.   Even if troops should be  available, it could scarcely be imagined that such a measure  would be contemplated,  incompatible as it was with the principle for which we were fighting.      The  Luristan Chiefs. Sir Percy Cox telegraphed on the 17th June in regard  to our policy during  the  last few  months of encouraging these  chiefs  to look  to  Dizful for political guidance and material needs, a policy which he said  had borne unexpected and  gratifying fruit.   A  significant  development  was  the,  perhaps  temporary,. conversion of the  headmen-habitual  brigands into common carriers with a  stake  in the maintenance of security on the caravan routes ; for  these headmen, prompted by the securer road conditions,  were arranging to take up merchandise for the merchants. of  Khoramabad.  This development,  so long as  it endured, should have  a  highly &quot;favourable effect  on British trade towards central  Persia.  The  essential condition, so far as we were concerned, was that we should remain firm towards the Bakhtiari aggression.     South Persian Rifles. Sir  C. Marling sent  two telegrams  on  the  13th  June [Nos.  202 and 203] in regard to the South Persian Bifles.   He said that he had come -to the conclusion, after discussion with the inspector-general and Colonel Hunter, that it was essential to give the former much greater latitude.  The Government of India apparently intended that the force should be organised on  the model of the  imperial army  ; but as it was a  Persian force modifications required by local conditions  must be introduced.  The ccnditions of service and of the appointment of officers also  required r-evising.  As regarded the former, something  must be  done to render them attractive if good results were to  be obtained ; whilst in the matter of appointments in a, Persian force, there  seemed to be no  adequate  reason why they  should not  be made on the authority of the inspector, with reference home, and perhaps subject to the approval  of the Persian Government.   In  financial  matters  greater   freedom   was  even  more indispensable.   At present the complicated minutiae of Indian regulations was  exacted, the result being, in the absence of a  clerical  staff, that  British officers had to neglect training  for desk  work.  More than  this, it  seemed  unreasonable  to  apply Indian regulations to  the  very dissimilar conditions of Persia.   Further,  it seemed useless to inaugurate a system of control which would be  dropped wdien [the  cost of the  force was borne by  Persia.  The only  practical course  seemed  to  be  to  authorise  the inspector-general to spend up to the limit of his  approved budget, with power  to &quot;make transfers as expediency and  experience might dictate.  It appeared to him that it was impossible for the inspector-general to show good results if his hands  were tied by red- tape regulations framed for totally different conditions.     In his second telegram he said that the Indian Government seemed to believe that it would be advantageous  to  appoint  an  officer of high rank with  full control over civilians and military in south  Persia, and to utilise the  South Persian Rifles for British interests, and even  as in some way an adjunct to the Imperial forces, an idea-which was wholly fallacious :  Persian feeling was  not with us, and, if it were, the appointment of such an officer would arouse a suspicion that we designed taking over the administration of southern  Persia.  Even if the South Persian Rifles did not turn against him they would not support  him and would desert-; his authority would repose in nothing but some 2,000 Indian  troops, who  had still to earn respect in southern Persia.  The  Russian revolution had altered the conditions,, and the only way of  making a success of the force was to make it truly Persian, to be used by the Persian Government.   We should have to send 20,000  men, if we tried to do as  the  Indian Government  suggested.   Sir  P. Sykes had been set a task utterly out of proportion to the  means supplied him,  and the military attache, who had  visited Shiraz, considered that the results achieved  reflected the  greatest credit on him  and  his staff; he possessed the true comprehension of the political aspect  of  the  matter^ which was at least as essential to success as organising ability.     Sir C. Marling telegraphed  again  on the 14th June [No. 206] that in a private conversation the Minister of War, a very moderate man, had not  concealed from him that the  Government  would approach  us with  proposals  to  substitute neutrals forBritish officers  in the South Persian Rifles.   It was  already refusing to recognise theincrease of the Cossack  brigade under the agreement of last August.
    The Russian Minister. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 16th June [No. 903]that the  Bussian Minister was leaving for Tehran  that night.   He  had told theCounsellor of the Embassy  that  his only  definite  instruction  was  to continue toco-operate with Sir C. Marling as before; he  should certainly do all that he could tosupport the moderate element, but. it would  not be possible  for him to oppose theMedjliss, or to take a very strong line.  The Counsellor had already seen  the AssistantMinister for Foreign Affairs, and  had urged  the necessity for the Minister  at  Tehranbeing instructed not to give the impression that the democrats had  Russian support;he was told in reply  that, on account  of the  Russian situation, the  Ministers  positionwould be a very difficult one, and that his line would be that of non-interference withthe internal affairs  of Persia ; with  that limitation  he  would do  what he could tostrengthen the moderates.   The Counsellor received the impression that, from the fear of raising opposition in  Russia, the Russian  Government  was afraid to  take an active partin Persian affairs.    The Governor of Ispahan. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 14th June [No. 209]that it  was  proposed  to  appoint  Itizad-ns-Sultaneh,  the  Shah&apos;s  elder  brother,Governor of Ispahan in the place of Akbar, who had been forced to resign his office.AkbaPs resignation showed the complete  ascendency of democrats in the Government,as it was. brought about in spite of the support of the two legations.    Repayment of the Fars Advances. Sir  C. Marling telegraphed on the  14th  June[No. 205] that he proposed to  remind the Persian Government, should an opportunityoffer, that it was necessary for  it to provide for the repayment  of the  Ears advances,and. to  request, for that purpose,  the ear-marking  of  part of  the . mint  profits;and on the 16th June Mr. Balfour informed  him [No. 160] that he approved of thisproposal.                                                               9    Prince Salar-ed-Doivleh. Sir C. Marling telegraphed  on the 15th June [No. 211]that the  Russian military authorities appeared to be in treaty with Salar-ed-Dowlehto give him the governorship  of  western (? Persia) on  the condition  that  he should raise the tribes for them.   He had  been for some time  with  the  Turkish troops inKurdistan, accompanied, it was said, by a son of the late Sultan of Turkey.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.                                    RUSSIA.     The  Catholic  Archbishop of  Lemberg. Sir  G.  Buchanan  telegraphed  on  the19th  June  [No. 927] that he had  been informed by  the Russian Government  thatit had been decided to liberate the Archbishop of Lemberg (Count  Sceptycky)  and hissuite ; they would leave Russia shortly.                                    TURKEY.     The Turkish Government and Turkish Subjects in Switzerland. Sir H. Rumboldtelegraphed from Berne on the 20th  June [No. 515] that he had learnt that emissariesof the Turkish Government had arrived  in Switzerland during the last few days, their business being to try to persuade  the late Khedive, prominent Syrians such as TueniBey, the late Sultaifs daughter, and  her husband  to return  to Constantinople.  Theinducement held out to the late Khedive and  to the Syrians was  ample compensationfor  the loss incurred by them in respect of  their property ;  whilst  the daughter ofthe late Sultan  and  her husband had been  told  that they need  fear no harm.  TheTurkish emissaries had also stated that   the compensation promised to the Syrians and(? to) the jDopulation of Syria would be guaranteed by Gei-many.                                MESOPOTAMIA.     Administration of Baghdad. The  following  note, by Sir James Meston, on thefuture system  of government  at Baghdad,   was  communicated to the MesopotamiaAdministration Committee:       In the report of Lord Curzon&apos;s committee which was accopted  by the Imperial WarCabinet at one of its  last  meetings,  there are  references to the future of Mesopotamia&quot; under British control,&apos;&apos;  and to  the desirability  of &quot; an Arab State or congeries  of       [89b-48]                                                        C
States under the protection of Great Britain.&quot;  I do not know whether these expressionsare intended to define with precision the future method of government in the Baghdadvilayat, and more especially over the Holy Places  of Islam in  that  area Kerbala,Najaf, &amp;c.   On the assumption, however, that the exact degree of British control is notyet finally decided,  I  suggest that  it would be well  to ascertain  the feeling of ourMahomedan fellow-subjects on the point.  This would,  of course,  be done through theadministrations immediately concerned,  particularly the Government of India.   In this note  I  merely put  forward my  own  reading of the  Moslem  mind of India on  thesubject.     My reason for  writing  is my belief that any protectorate by a Christian Power or group of Powers over the Moslem shrines in Arabia would  acutely offend the deepestsentiments of our Mahomedan population.   This is just as true of Mecca and Medina asit is  of the shrines near Baghdad.  But 1 understand that the British Governmenthas defined its  own relations with the Sharif of Mecca, now King of Hedjaz ; and i therefore refrain from alluding to  that side of tbe question, except where it is inextricablyassociated with Mesopotamian affairs.    All good Moslems  are at one  in reverencing Mecca, Medina,  and the adjacent tractof country (the Hedjaz) in Central Arabia.   The Shiah sect  of  Mahomedans reverencealso, and with special devotion, the shrines at Kerbala, Najaf, &amp;e, near Baghdad.  the historical  reasons for  this  are  well known;  what  I wish  to  impress is  that Shiahsentiment in the matter deserves&apos;special consideration.  The Shiah sect, besides beingdominant in Persia, forms a  substantial element  in  our  Indian Mahomedans, and hasbeen conspicuously friendly and loyal.   In  India, when the Sharif of Mecca&apos;s assertionof independence was first made known, an attempt was begun to organise an agitation against him and his claims.   The Shiahs  took no part in  this outcry, although theydisliked the Sharif&apos;s  action  for  several  of the reasons propounded by  the Sunniagitators.   The  Shiahs have all  along been  very  unhappy about our campaign  inMesopotamia,  and hate the idea  of bloodshed in  their holy  land round Baghdad; butthey have never raised a voice in protest,   They have  withstood all suggestions for aJihad (or Holy War), and have justified their opposition on  strong theological grounds.They have no feeling against the Caliphate  passing away from the Sultan of Turkey.  Ina word, they have  been perfectly staunch to the British  Government, and have neverlistened to  any temptation to embarrass us.     The strength of the feeling: which was manifested in India against the Sharif andwhich caused some astonishment outside India was partly due to ignorance of the true position, but was also  largely based  on  two objections deeply rooted in the Mahomedanmind.   They loathed the possibility of war  on the sacred soil of the Hedjaz, particularly if Christian forces should be  involved ;  and they believed  that the Sharif would  bea puppet in the hands  of the  Christian Powers.   The  first sentiment is intelligible  tous all ;  the second  is based on an important tenet of Mahomedan faith, and the sametenet is applicable to the future of the  shrines near Baghdad,   It may briefly be thusexplained.    The sanctity of the Holy Places is contingent on their being  in the custody of aMahomedan authority or Power  competent  to  protect them against violation.  Theirguardian would  in time  become,   I  fancy,  the ex officio  Caliph ;  and  if he is unable(whether as Caliph or otherwise)  to defend them by the sword of Islam alone, his failurewill  ipso facto mean  the appearance of the last  Imam,  chaos, forcible conversion ofthe whole earth to Mahomedanism in brief,  what we should call the end of the world.It is thus  unthinkable   to  the  Mahomedan  mind   that the  impotence  of Moslem.guardianship should be confessed by the establishment of a Christian protectorate orsuzerainty over either the Hedjaz or the Shiah shrines in Mesopotamia.     What would happen in practice if Great Britain and  its Allies did decide  onsuch  a  protectorate, I cannot pretend  to  prophesy.   The end  of  the  world probablywould not  come; but  among our Moslem population an unrest and resentment would beengendered  which no  prudent Government  would provoke  except  under  very gravenecessitv.   An extra-friendly Mahomedan  here and there would be glad at heart to seethe  shrines  under  honest  and  capable  supervision  such  as  we  could ensure;  anacquaintance of mine actually dared to say so in  a  pamphlet  which he wrote on the entrance of Turkey into the war; but he was met with a storm of  obloquy,  and it  isclear  that  the  Mahomedan  world generally would not tolerate the suggestion.  I have just happened upon a strong  corroboraiion of this view in a quotation  from an addressby the late Lord Cromer.  While expressing some delicacy in  giving  a  definite opinionon a purelv  theological issue, he wrote r 
         &quot; It is held that  the due exercise of the  spiritual  power cannot  be ensured    unless the Khalif is placed in a position of assured political independence.  Hence,    although  possibly  the  substitution  of  some  Khalif other than the  Sultan of    Turkey  might  be  effected  without  any great  shock  to  Moslem  opinion  and    Sentiment, the recognition of a Khalif who could directly or indirectly be brought    under non-Moslem influences would be strongly resented.&quot;    In a matter of this  sort  it is easier to be critical than suggestive.  It is possible,however, that the King  of the Hedjaz may provide a way out.   The Crown of Arabiamight be acknowledged in the treaties of peace as an independent Power, and given theultimate sovereignty of Baghdad, subject to any terms on which the British Governmentand the Sharif may separately agree as  to the  actual form of administration.  many who know  Arabia doubt whether the new kingdom wull hold together for more  thana few years, but it could be made to  serve our purpose  for the time, and the problems arising from its. disintegration will come on us when we have  more leisure to deal  withthem.  For the moment,  what I wish to  suggest  is that the assertion of any form ofcontrol, protection,  or  suzerainty by  Great  Britain or her  allies  over   the  Holy(Mahomedan)  Places near  Baghdad  should  be  postponed   until  Moslem  feeling isascertained.                                    PERSIA.    Attitude of the Russian Government. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the  19thJune  ,[No. 926] that the Assistant  Minister for Foreign Affairs had expressed theopinion that it was impossible, in present  circumstances, to oppose the democrats, andthat the only  policy to follow was to endeavour to  come to some working arrangement with them.  He said that he knew that this was not Sir C. Marling&apos;s view.  Sir G.Buchanan  added that it seemed pretty clear  that if we were to take  a strong line in persia we must be prepared to rely entirely on our own resources.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. P..
